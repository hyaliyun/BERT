First, let's break down the elements of the tweet to understand the underlying emotions and tone: 1. \\"@ROCKGUITARZ\\": The use of a username as a mention indicates that the tweet is directed at a specific person. This gives the tweet a personal and conversational tone, making the statement feel more like a casual remark made in a friendly conversation rather than a generic comment. 2. \\"It's always a good day\\": This phrase sets the overall tone of positivity for the tweet. By saying that something makes the day \\"good,\\" the tweeter implies that whatever is being discussed has a significant impact on their happiness and overall well-being. 3. \\"when I don't have to cook\\": This part of the tweet reveals the specific situation that makes the tweeter feel good – not having to cook. The use of the phrase \\"don't have to\\" suggests that cooking might be seen as a chore or an activity that they don't necessarily enjoy. This is further reinforced by the word \\"always\\" in the phrase \\"It's always a good day,\\" indicating that avoiding cooking is consistently associated with a positive outcome. 4. Use of humor and lightheartedness: Although the tweet addresses a personal preference (not cooking), it does not come off as a strong complaint or a deeply emotional statement. Instead, the tone is kept light and relatable, making it seem more like a playful comment that others could easily connect to. Considering these elements, we can describe the sentiment of the tweet as positive – the tweeter is expressing happiness and satisfaction when they don't have to cook. Additionally, the light, conversational tone and the humorous, relatable way the preference is presented suggest a lightheartedness that further enhances the positive sentiment. Overall, this tweet can be seen as a cheerful and upbeat contribution to a conversation, likely to evoke agreement, empathy, or friendly reactions from others who feel the same way about cooking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Francis Jean Marcel Poulenc (French: [fRasis Za maRsel pulek]; 7 January 1899 - 30 January 1963) was a French composer and pianist. His compositions include melodies, solo piano works, chamber music, choral pieces, operas, ballets, and orchestral concert music. Among the best-known are the piano suite Trois mouvements perpetuels (1919), the ballet Les biches (1923), the Concert champetre (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the Organ Concerto (1938), the opera Dialogues des Carmelites (1957), and the Gloria (1959) for soprano, choir and orchestra. See also: FP (Catalogue of compositions), List of compositions Poulenc's music is essentially diatonic. In Henri Hell's view, this is because the main feature of Poulenc's musical art is his melodic gift. In the words of Roger Nichols in the Grove dictionary, \\"For [Poulenc] the most important element of all was melody and he found his way to a vast treasury of undiscovered tunes within an area that had, according to the most up-to-date musical maps, been surveyed, worked and exhausted.\\" The commentator George Keck writes, \\"His melodies are simple, pleasing, easily remembered, and most often emotionally expressive.\\" Poulenc said that he was not inventive in his harmonic language. The composer Lennox Berkeley wrote of him, \\"All through his life, he was content to use conventional harmony, but his use of it was so individual, so immediately recognizable as his own, that it gave his music freshness and validity.\\" Keck considers Poulenc's harmonic language \\"as beautiful, interesting and personal as his melodic writing ... clear, simple harmonies moving in obviously defined tonal areas with chromaticism that is rarely more than passing\\". Poulenc had no time for musical theories; in one of his many radio interviews he called for \\"a truce to composing by theory, doctrine, rule!\\" He was dismissive of what he saw as the dogmatism of latter-day adherents to dodecaphony, led by Rene Leibowitz, and greatly regretted that the adoption of a theoretical approach had affected the music of Olivier Messiaen, of whom he had earlier had high hopes. To Hell, almost all Poulenc's music is \\"directly or indirectly inspired by the purely melodic associations of the human voice\\". Poulenc was a painstaking craftsman, though a myth grew up - \\"la legende de facilite\\" - that his music came easily to him; he commented, \\"The myth is excusable, since I do everything to conceal my efforts.\\" The pianist Pascal Roge commented in 1999 that both sides of Poulenc's musical nature were equally important: \\"You must accept him as a whole. If you take away either part, the serious or the non-serious, you destroy him. If one part is erased you get only a pale photocopy of what he really is.\\" Poulenc recognised the dichotomy, but in all his works he wanted music that was \\"healthy, clear and robust - music as frankly French as Stravinsky's is Slav\\".

However, rather than capitalizing on its potential to be appealing and even educational for younger audiences, the movie ends up falling short due to a weak plot, uninspired characters, and blatant product placements that amount to nothing more than a series of unrelatable \\"inside jokes.\\" The premise of the movie centers around Gene (voiced by T.J. Miller), an emoji who is designated to be \\"meh\\" but struggles to hide his technical glitch of having multiple emotions. Desperate to become \\"normal,\\" he sets off on a quest to find a code that can fix his glitch with the help of his new friends Hi-5 (voiced by James Corden) and a notorious codebreaker emoji named Jailbreak (Anna Faris). Meanwhile, Gene's parents, who are also \\"meh\\" emojis, set out to find their missing son as the smartphone owner, Alex, schedules to have his phone wiped clean after various inopportune technical malfunctions. While the concept of exploring a digital world inside a device used daily by millions of people might seem intriguing, the film's plot goes nowhere. Instead of utilizing a clever narrative to navigate this imaginative environment, The Emoji Movie relies heavily on clichéd tropes and a predictable storyline that borrows heavily from previous successful animated films with similar concepts, such as \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" and \\"Inside Out.\\" Moreover, the characters in the movie are underdeveloped and unengaging. Gene's solely defined by his \\"glitch\\" rather than any memorable qualities, making it difficult for audiences to root for him or empathize with his struggles for self-acceptance. The supporting characters, like the overly enthusiastic Hi-5 and the tired stereotype Jailbreak (the \\"rebellious\\" female character fighting societal norms), are equally forgettable despite the film's attempts at creating a sense of camaraderie and excitement. One of the most glaring issues with the film, however, is the blatant and excessive product placement that peppers the already dull storyline. From a prolonged scene in the app Candy Crush to a visit to the worlds of Spotify, Just Dance, and Instagram, the film misses opportunities for genuine humor and storytelling and instead reduces itself to a thinly veiled advertisement for multiple brands and popular apps. This product-driven approach detracts further from the film's potential emotional depth or connection with its audience. The Emoji Movie's subpar graphics and animation, coupled with a lackluster voice cast led by T.J. Miller, ultimately failed to bring any level of emotion or engagement to the film, further solidifying its status as a box office flop and disappointing fans and critics alike. In conclusion, The Emoji Movie is a glaring example of wasted potential and serves as a reminder that relying on trends, clichés, and excessive product placement will not save a poorly developed story or characters. It's a missed opportunity to create entertainment and meaningful content from a potentially fascinating concept, leaving audiences unsurprised by its negative reception and lack of box office success."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The study, conducted by neuroscientists and psychologist from the University of Maryland, concluded that women talked more because they had more of the Foxp2 protein. The research, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, found that higher levels were found among humans that were women but in rats that were males. Their findings came after it was previously claimed that ladies speak about 20,000 words a day - over 13,000 more than men. \\"This study is one of the first to report a sex difference in the expression of a language-associated protein in humans or animals,\\" said Prof Margaret McCarthy, who led the study. In their study, the researchers attempted to determine what might make male rats more vocal than their female friends. They separated four-day-old rats from their mothers and then counted the number of times they cried out in the \\"ultrasonic range\\", the frequencies higher than humans can hear, over five minutes. While both sexes called out hundreds of cries, the males called out twice as often, they found. But when the pups were returned to their mother's cage, she _ her sons first. Tests conducted on the parts of the brain known to be associated with vocalcalls showed the male pups have up to twice as much Foxp2 protein as the females. The researchers then increased the production in the brains of female pups and reduced it in males. This led to the female rats crying out more often and their mothers showing more interest to them. In contrast, males became less \\"talkative\\". The researchers then tested samples from ten children, aged between three and five, which showed that females had up to 30 per cent more of the Foxp2 protein than males, in a brain area key to language in humans. \\"Based on our observations, we assume higher levels of Foxp2 in girls and higher levels of Foxp2 in male rats is an indication that Foxp2 protein levels are associated with the more communicative sex,\\"...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve -4*z = z for z. Solve this problem.","completion":"Alright, little buddy, let's solve this little math puzzle together! So we have this equation: -4 * z = z Now, imagine you have -4 apples (like you owe 4 apples to your friend) and you want to find out how many apples you should add to make it equal to z apples. The first thing we'll do is to put all the z's (the apples) on one side. So we'll add 4*z to both sides of the equation: -4 * z + 4 * z = z + 4 * z Now, look at this: -4 apples + 4 apples give you 0 apples, right? So, on the left side, we have: 0 = z + 5 * z Now, we just need to calculate how many apples we have on the right side: 5 * z means you have 5 groups of z apples. But we don't know how many apples are in those groups yet! For now, our equation looks like this: 0 = 5 * z Now, to find out how many apples are in z, we can divide both sides by 5: 0 / 5 = (5 * z) / 5 And remember, zero divided by any number (except 0) is still zero: 0 = z So there you have it!

Their imaginations often got the better of them, leading Debbie to recall playing Ouija with Isabelle inside the Galardi's massive, creaky attic during one particularly memorable sleepover. The planchette seemed to move on its own accord, and both girls were equally frightened and thrilled by the mysterious spirit they believed they were speaking to. That night, both girls vowed never to forget the spirit they met that evening on the Ouija board. Time passed, and Debbie and Isabelle grew older. Their childhood games of contacting the other side began to seem like silly distractions from their increasingly busy lives. Eventually, they found themselves in college, and their bond still remained strong. On the last day of finals, Debbie invited Isabelle, along with their other friends, Pete and Laine, to unwind and celebrate the end of another semester. Unbeknownst to the others, Debbie had kept that old Ouija board stored away in the back of her closet as a reminder of her cherished childhood memories. During a lull in the conversation, Debbie brought out the dusty Ouija board as a nostalgic joke. None of them realized they were about to make contact with the very spirit Debbie and Isabelle had encountered years before. As the planchette began to move on its own, just as it had long ago, Debbie was flooded with dread. She impulsively threw the board across the room, ending the impromptu séance and terrorizing those gathered. The board landed unnoticed in the corner, but the energy from the other side still lurked, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Much to everyone's horror, the malicious presence lingered in the room after the candles were blown out. It unexpectedly gained strength, smashing Pete's hand and face into the large mirror that hung on the wall, shattering the glass and wreaking havoc among the friends. All their laughter and light-heartedness dissipated, replaced by shock, fear, and pain as they rushed to aid their injured friend, Pete. In the following days, eerie incidents occurred which left the friends questioning their reality. Hi Friend, the same phrase that the spirit had spelled out on the Ouija board during their childhood encounter, began appearing in unexpected places. Isabelle discovered the phrase etched into her wooden desk, Pete found it written on his wrist in his own handwriting, and Laine noticed the phrase on her computer screen one morning as she opened her laptop. This sense of foreboding began to take a toll on the group and isolated them from the world around them. They knew they had to find out more about the spirit who seemed to be wreaking havoc on their lives. Desperate, Laine and Debbie dove head-first into research, hoping to uncover any useful information about the spirit and how to fight it. Eventually, they stumbled upon the story of a little girl named Doris Zander, who belonged to the previous family that lived in Debbie's house. Digging further, they learned that the Zander family was plagued by misfortunes, and some suspected that little Doris was at the center of these tragedies, perhaps as the vessel or the unfortunate victim. As the friends connected the dots, they realized that the spirit's intentions were far more sinister than they initially thought. Driven by fear and a desire to protect themselves and each other, they resolved to unravel the mystery of Doris Zander and her connection to the malevolent force that threatened their lives. United as friends once more, Debbie, Isabelle, Pete, and Laine found the strength to confront the darkness they'd unknowingly unleashed through that old, dusty Ouija board, and began a journey to free the little girl's spirit and save their own lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(2) The PRO , which is a \`\` null DP '' is in the subject position of the embedded clause . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences essentially convey the same meaning, but they use slightly different terminology to describe the same linguistic concept. Both sentences are referring to the \\"PRO\\" element, which is a type of unpronounced subject in certain embedded clauses. Let's analyze both sentences in detail: 1. The first sentence describes the PRO as a \\"zero-DP,\\" which stands for \\"zero determiner phrase.\\" This term implies that the PRO is an unpronounced or empty constituent serving as the subject in an embedded clause. The use of \\"zero\\" indicates that the element usually has no overt phonetic realization, and it cannot be explicitly heard or seen in speech or writing. In linguistic analysis, empty categories like zero-DP are often used to account for certain grammatical and syntactic phenomena. 2. The second sentence uses the term \\"null DP\\" instead of \\"zero-DP.\\" The word \\"null\\" serves the same purpose as \\"zero\\" in this context, as it signifies the absence of an overt phonetic form. Both \\"zero\\" and \\"null\\" are common ways of describing an element that is not overtly realized in a given sentence structure. This sentence also states that the PRO serves as the subject of the embedded clause, aligning it with the meaning expressed in the first sentence. In summary, both sentences describe the same linguistic concept, specifically, the unpronounced or empty subject known as PRO in certain embedded clauses. They only differ in their choice of terminology, with the first sentence using \\"zero-DP\\" and the second one using \\"null DP.\\" Despite these differences in terminology, both sentences effectively convey the same idea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This distinction between the two individuals' enjoyment of puzzles can be attributed to several factors related to their creativity levels, personal preferences, and cognitive function. Firstly, let's understand why Sarah's creativity makes puzzles exciting for her. Creativity often involves the ability to connect disparate concepts, solve problems, and think outside the box. For someone like Sarah, puzzles provide the perfect opportunity to exercise her mental prowess. Puzzles challenge her to analyze patterns, develop strategies, and adapt her thinking to overcome obstacles. As a creative person, Sarah likely finds pleasure in the process of problem-solving, iterating on her solutions, and finally discovering the correct path to complete the puzzle. In contrast, Emily's lack of excitement for puzzles might stem from her not being as creative a person. While she may possess other strengths and interests, the world of puzzles may not hold as much appeal for her because she does not derive the same level of satisfaction from solving them as Sarah does. It is possible that Emily enjoys activities that require different cognitive strengths or those that cater to her specific interests and talents. Furthermore, individuals with higher levels of creativity are often considered to possess traits such as curiosity, persistence, and openness to new experiences. These characteristics could explain why Sarah finds puzzles so engaging – her inherently curious nature drives her to explore and uncover new challenges, while her persistence enables her to persevere even when the puzzles become difficult. At the same time, her openness to new experiences may lead her to appreciate the variety and novelty of different types of puzzles. On the other hand, Emily may possess a different set of traits. If she is more inclined towards structured thinking, routine, or well-defined activities, puzzles that require thinking beyond the bounds of traditional problem-solving might not appeal to her. It is worth mentioning that personal preferences and interests play a significant role in determining how much one enjoys a particular activity, and differing tastes between Sarah and Emily could explain their contrasting perspectives on puzzles. In conclusion, puzzles are exciting for Sarah and not Emily, largely due to Sarah being a creative person. Sarah's creativity provides her with the cognitive tools and innate curiosity that make puzzles an enjoyable and stimulating activity, while Emily's lack of excitement may be attributed to her preference for other pursuits or a different cognitive skill set. Both Sarah and Emily are unique individuals, and their interests and aptitudes are shaped by a combination of personal traits, cognitive abilities, and individual experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes. A species of animal called a markalong was discovered that can reproduce either sexually or asexually. Two markalongs were just born from different families in a zoo.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Should you marry a girl who had a boyfriend in the past ? Should you marry a girl who has been in a relationship? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The two questions are similar but not exactly the same. The first question asks if one should marry a girl who had a boyfriend in the past, and the second question asks if one should marry a girl who has been in a relationship. While both questions address the issue of a girl's previous relationship experience, the second question is broader since it generalizes about any past relationship, which could include boyfriends, girlfriends, or any other type of romantic or intimate connection. Evaluating whether to marry a person based on their past relationships could be a subjective decision that depends on individual values and beliefs. However, it's important to remember that evaluating a potential spouse should be based on various factors regarding the person's character and compatibility with oneself rather than merely focusing on their past relationships. Here are a few essential aspects to consider: 1. Compatibility: Assess if you and your potential spouse share similar values, beliefs, and interests, and if you both enjoy each other's company. A relationship built on compatibility forms a stronger foundation for marriage than a person's past relationship history. 2. Trust: Establishing trust is of utmost importance in any relationship. If you find it challenging to trust the person because of their past relationships, you should evaluate whether the issue stems from an insecurity within you or the person's behavior in the present context. If they have moved on from their past, learned from those experiences, and have demonstrated trustworthiness since then, it may not be fair to judge them solely based on the past. 3. Emotional baggage: People who have had past relationships might carry some emotional baggage, but it is essential to remember that everyone has a past, and we all have made mistakes and grown from them. The key is to understand whether the person has come to terms with their past, overcome any emotional baggage, and is ready to commit to a new chapter in life with you. 4. Personal growth: It is vital to consider whether the person has grown as an individual since their past relationships. If they have learned from their experiences, matured emotionally and mentally, and made positive changes, it is not fair to penalize them for a past relationship. 5. Communication: Open and honest communication is a pillar of any successful relationship. If concerns about the person's past relationships arise, it is crucial to have a mature and non-judgmental conversation about it. Understand the context of their past, what they learned from it, and ensure that both parties are genuinely committed to moving forward together. In conclusion, marrying someone who has had a previous relationship or a boyfriend/girlfriend in the past should not be a deal-breaker. Instead, focus on other essential aspects such as compatibility, trust, emotional baggage, personal growth, and communication. Remember, it is the present and the future that matter the most when building a life together, and a person's past relationships should not overshadow the potential for a successful and fulfilling marriage if they have genuinely evolved and grown from their experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This makes storing a dollar bill in a pocket a practical choice for many people. 4. No additional item required: Using a pocket to carry a dollar bill doesn't require any additional item, such as a wallet, billfold, or purse. This is especially helpful for those who don't own such items or prefer not to carry them. 5.

Given the question: Process: - A mold spore floats through the air - The spore lands on a piece of bread - The spore grows hyphae into the bread - The mold forms a colony - Sporangiophores grow upward - The mold sends out spores. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more mold forms into a colony happens, how will it affect more Sporangiophores grow upward. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect (both direct and indirect) on the process. When more mold forms into a colony, it leads to greater growth, biomass, and presence of the mold on the piece of bread. This has a direct impact on the number of sporangiophores growing upward, as more mold in a colony would lead to more nutrient absorption and a larger colony size, resulting in an increase in sporangiophores production. The development and growth of sporangiophores are a significant part of the mold's reproductive process, as they bear spore-producing structures (sporangia) that release spores into the environment. When more mold develops into a colony, the mold has a higher capacity to create and support additional sporangiophores. This means that the perturbation in this case is likely to result in a higher number of sporangiophores growing upward, enabling the mold to produce and disperse more spores throughout the environment, further propagating its presence. In addition, the increased growth of sporangiophores can have indirect effects on the mold's colonization process. As more sporangiophores grow upward and release more spores into the environment, this increases the chances of these spores landing on and colonizing other surfaces where they can access nutrients and continue growing. This self-perpetuating cycle results in an enhanced capability for the mold to spread and colonize new areas, thriving on the nutrient-rich surfaces they encounter. In conclusion, an increase in mold forming into a colony does affect more sporangiophores growing upward as it leads to increased nutrient absorption, larger colony size, and greater potential for reproduction. Consequently, this perturbation results in both direct and indirect effects on the mold's colonization and reproductive processes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Kinks' next single, \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs.

Casimere: There are a variety of pinot noirs, fruitier merlots, light bodied Italian reds and certainly a stunning array of rosé that go terrifically with fish. In the south of France, for example, it’s not uncommon to see the lighter red wines of the region served lightly chilled. Casimere:A Tempranillo [wine] from Spain, a Zinfandel from California or a hearty Barolo from Italy are matches made in Heaven. Fresh off a trip to Italy, Casimere brought the Scacciadiavoli Rosso di Montefalco, which retails for about 23 and the Nipozzano Riserva Marchesi de Frescobaldi, which is made from that fabulous Tuscan Sangiovese grape and sells for about 19. If you have to pick a white, what are some of your favorites for a spring or summer barbecue? Casimere: Pinot Grigio is number one.

When Amanda Knox was convicted again on Thursday, Americans reacted with bafflement. The appeal was the third round through Italy's grinding, multi-level legal system, with its numerous checks and balances. But the saga is also confusing because, while the crime is simple, the case built around it is a grand spectacle combining aspects of national pride, sexist archetypes and race. Knox and her co-defendant, Raffaele Sollecito, were first convicted by a jury in 2009 for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher in 2007. An appellate judge overturned the conviction in 2011 and Knox returned to the United States after four years in jail. The prosecutor then appealed the acquittal to the Italian Supreme Court, which sent the case to the new appellate panel that reinstated the conviction. From that interview and many more, I pieced together a picture of a young man who seemed to be acting out some sort of fantasy of a home, a fantasy that perhaps abruptly cracked when OPTIONS: - Amanda Knox came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house, and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Americans came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house, and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - British came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house, and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Burleigh came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house, and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Italian came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house, and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Italy came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house, and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Knox came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house, and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Meredith Kercher came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house, and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Nina Burleigh came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house, and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Raffaele Sollecito came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house, and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Rudy Guede came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house, and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - Supreme Court came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house, and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him. - United States came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house, and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him.","completion":"- Meredith Kercher came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house, and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"While both questions revolve around the concept of creativity, they address different subjects – one is focused on creative teaching, specifically in the context of the education field, while the second question is more general, asking about what makes an individual creative. To provide a more comprehensive answer, both concepts – creative teaching and individual creativity – will be explored separately. Creative teaching refers to the use of imaginative and innovative techniques and strategies to convey information and educate in a way that promotes active learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving. It breaks free from traditional teaching methodologies, striving to engage and inspire students by creating a more immersive and meaningful learning experience. There are several factors that contribute to making teaching creative: 1. Flexibility: Creative teaching involves adapting and modifying lesson plans, methodologies, and practices to suit the unique needs and interests of the students. Educators should be willing to explore new ideas and experiment with different methods to keep the learning experience fresh and relevant. 2. Personalization: Recognizing and catering to the individual learning styles, strengths, and weaknesses of each student is crucial in creative teaching. This may involve using various educational tools and resources to accommodate diverse learning needs, such as visual aids, interactive activities, group work, or individual tasks. 3. Interdisciplinary approach: Creative teaching often involves combining knowledge and concepts from multiple subject areas to paint a holistic picture and stimulate deeper understanding. This approach helps to reveal the connections between various topics, enhancing students' critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. 4. Active learning: Encouraging students to take a proactive role in the learning process is a key aspect of creative teaching. This can be achieved through inquiry-based learning, group projects, debates, or other interactive activities that promote collaboration and critical thinking. 5. Emphasis on problem-solving: Fostering a problem-solving mindset in students can help them to develop the skills needed to address complex and novel situations. Creative teaching may incorporate real-life problems and challenges to stimulate students' curiosity and provide opportunities for skill development. 6. Use of technology: Integrating technology into the classroom (e.g., computers, interactive whiteboards, tablets) can provide new avenues for creative teaching. Education technology can help to supplement traditional teaching methods and offer innovative and engaging ways for students to learn and explore new topics. Individual creativity, on the other hand, refers to the ability of a person to create, invent, or discover new ideas, solutions, or artistic expressions by combining existing knowledge and resources in unique and original ways. Factors that contribute to individual creativity include: 1. Imagination: Creative individuals possess a vivid imagination that enables them to envision novel ideas and possibilities, transcending the boundaries of conventional thought. 2. Curiosity: A curious mindset drives creative individuals to explore new subjects, ask questions, and seek answers, constantly expanding their knowledge base. 3. Cognitive flexibility: The ability to shift perspectives, adapt to new situations, and discover unconventional solutions is essential for creativity. 4. Divergent thinking: Creative individuals are often skilled at divergent thinking, which involves generating multiple, varied solutions to a given problem or challenge. 5. Persistence: Creativity often requires persistence, allowing individuals to refine and hone their ideas over time in the face of setbacks and challenges. 6. Open-mindedness: Open-minded individuals are receptive to new experiences, ideas, and perspectives, which can contribute to their creative thinking. In conclusion, while creative teaching and individual creativity share common traits, such as flexibility, open-mindedness, and problem-solving, the two concepts refer to different contexts. Creative teaching specifically addresses the use of creative strategies in education, while individual creativity is a broader concept relating to one's ability to generate and express novel ideas and solutions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Market analysts in the United States have recently been quoted as saying that the biggest threat to the luxury industry in the US is the tech industry. This is according to an article by fellow journalist Ashley Lutz. Her suggestion is sound. The main idea of her article is that products from Tiffany & Co. find their biggest competition not from other luxury brands but from companies like Apple. Lutz points out that luxury products are often only for \\"show,\\" while the attraction behind tech products is functionality. You find few people in the United States today willing to purchase luxury goods at full price. It didn't use to be that way. Luxury goods used to be actually _ . That meant you needed to travel to the right store to purchase them, and you didn't even have the option of getting a deal. Today, no one wants to pay full price for luxury goods. People have the unfortunate belief that fakes somehow are equal to originals, and if you can't get a deal on eBay, Amazon, or in an outlet store, purchasing a luxury product probably isn't worth it. Luxury brands struggle to remain high-end images despite the reality that the American consumer is motivated much more by discounts than they are by brand names or image. Yet people stand in line to pay full price for a new product from Apple and crowds gather to hear about a new smart phone. While electronics are updating every day, people are purchasing technology at full prices much more than they are purchasing luxury goods. What are high-tech makers doing right that luxury makers are pitifully failing at? Carefully looking at the situation, it would appear as if the Internet didn't hurt the luxury industry, expectation from the consumers did. What people want these days more than anything is stuff that does something. They want cars that drive, shoes that are comfortable, games that are fun to play, screens that are beautiful to look at, tools that are useful, and entertainment that is entertaining. Little of that fits into what the luxury industry has... Question: What does this passage mainly talk about? - Nobody likes luxury goods any more. - Luxury goods are of poor quality nowadays. - Tech products become the new \\"luxury goods\\". - Iphones have taken the place of luxury products.

Solution:","completion":"Task Explanation: The task is to describe a process that will lead to painting a survival container. The process should involve physical actions with objects and focus on physical knowledge about the world. Solution: Step 1: Gather the necessary materials Collect the required items such as the survival container, appropriate paint, paintbrushes or paint rollers, paint tray, drop cloth or old newspapers, painter's tape, sandpaper, and clean cloth. Step 2: Prepare the workspace Lay down the drop cloth or old newspapers in your designated painting area to protect the floor from any paint drips or spills. Ensure the workspace is well-ventilated to prevent inhaling paint fumes. Step 3: Clean the container Use a clean cloth to wipe the survival container thoroughly, removing any dirt, dust, or debris from the surface. This will ensure the paint adheres properly to the container. Step 4: Sand the container (if necessary) If the container's surface is glossy or has a finish that can prevent paint from adhering, lightly sand the entire surface with sandpaper to create a slightly rough texture for better paint adherence. Step 5: Apply painter's tape Use painter's tape to mask off any areas you do not want to paint, such as handles, hinges, or other hardware. This will help create clean lines and prevent paint from transferring to undesired areas. Step 6: Prepare the paint Pour the paint into the paint tray, and make sure to mix the paint thoroughly to ensure even color and consistency. Step 7: Apply the paint Dip the paintbrush or paint roller into the paint tray, removing any excess paint. Apply the paint in even strokes or rolls, covering the entire surface of the container. Be sure not to overload the brush or roller, as this can cause paint drips or uneven coverage. Step 8: Allow the paint to dry Follow the paint manufacturer's instructions for drying times, ensuring the paint has dried fully before proceeding. Step 9: Apply additional coats (if necessary) If the container requires more coverage, you can apply additional coats of paint. Allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next one. Step 10: Remove the painter's tape Once the final coat of paint has dried, carefully remove the painter's tape from the container. Step 11: Allow the paint to cure Give the painted container time to cure fully as per the paint manufacturer's recommendations. This may take up to several days, depending on the paint used. Step 12: Store the survival container Once the paint has fully cured, your survival container is ready for use. Store it safely in a desired location. By following these steps, we have successfully painted a survival container while following the guidelines provided by the task."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer:","completion":"The slimmed-down version of 'The Independent' newspaper you are referring to is known as 'i'. However, it is essential to note that the 'i' newspaper was initially launched in October 2010, not last year. It was designed to cater to readers who seek a concise yet comprehensive overview of daily news and analysis. The idea behind ‘i’ was to provide a time-efficient and easy-to-digest newspaper containing essential information without overwhelming the reader. Associated Newspapers Ltd acquired 'i' from Independent Print Limited in 2016. Ever since the acquisition by the parent company, the 'i' has seen continued growth in its readership, and it has evolved to cover a wide range of news topics, including politics, education, business, technology, environment, arts, and sports. In 2016, 'The Independent' became a digital-only publication, while the 'i' continued as a print newspaper. Therefore, ‘i’ serves as the print-version companion to 'The Independent's' online presence. To summarize, the slimmed-down version of 'The Independent' newspaper is called 'i'. It was launched in 2010 and has since become a popular newspaper that offers concise news and analysis.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? from a flat script and a low budget","completion":"This review can be considered to have a negative opinion of the movie. The review mentions two key aspects to support this conclusion: 1. \\"Flat script\\" - When someone refers to a script as \\"flat,\\" it usually implies that the plot is lacking in depth and complexity, or that the dialogue is uninspired or boring. It may also suggest that the storytelling does not engage the audience or evoke strong emotions. 2. \\"Low budget\\" - Mentioning a low budget typically implies that the production values are lower than average, which can negatively affect the movie's overall impression. A low budget may limit the resources available for crucial aspects such as special effects, set design, costume design, and casting. While budget does not necessarily determine the quality of the movie, noting the budgetary constraints might suggest that the reviewer perceived a lack of polish or detail in the film. By focusing on these negative aspects, the reviewer seems to express dissatisfaction and a unfavorable view of the movie. However, please note that the review is quite brief and may not fully encompass the reviewer's thoughts; a more detailed review might include positive elements, making the overall opinion more nuanced.

He will be on an opioid agonist for the rest of his life. His behavior mirrored the worst of what addicts do to a family. I was desperate to make a change, and my husband was desperate to save his son’s life. That meant having to watch my husband support my step-son as he abused me and my children. Multiple criminal behaviors, many times the police came to the house, two convictions, long-term parole. Watching him threaten to kill me, kill his father, and kill his younger brother and sister. Add to that a very stress job situation with a new boss who decided he needed a new VP, but had no basis to terminate my employment, so instead was determined to make my work life a living hell on earth. So, yep, I had a heart attack. I’m still angry at everything that led up to the heart attack. I’m working really hard on forgiving my husband, forgiving my step-son, and the overwhelming guilt of my children seeing me as an accomplice to their abuse. I found a new job, and then had the pleasure of seeing my former boss fired by the Board of Directors. Since then I find I’m hyper-vigilant in issues of child abuse, worker abuse, addiction, lying and deceit (Trump trigger), and feeling somewhat betrayed by my husband. I honestly think if it had been one of my children doing the abusing, I would have found a way to put my child into long-term rehab. I would not have pretended it wasn’t happening, or “not that bad” or other form of denial. As is, I lived through this hell for two years, and a part of me will never forgive for how it all came about. Probably TMI, sorry. Becky Question: Becky probably believes her children feel that she: Answer: A:","completion":"Becky probably believes her children feel that she was an accomplice to their abuse. This belief might have arisen from her perception that, as their mother, she failed to shield them from the harmful effects of her step-son's addictive behavior and the associated violent threats. Her reflection on the past events indicates significant remorse and guilt over her perceived inability to effectively stand against her step-son's conduct. Despite the aggressive behavior of her step-son, her husband's overwhelming desire to save his son might have inadvertently forced her into a passive role of allowing the abuse to persist. This might have made her children see her as an accomplice, given her apparent lack of resistance or action against the abusive step-son. Furthermore, her contemplation about what she would've done if her own children were the abusers, envisaging a firm decision to put them into long-term rehab and not living in denial, might reflect her regret about not taking a stronger stance. Therefore, Becky's feeling suggests that she believes her children might view her as a complicit in their own victimization, marked by her perceived inactivity during the abusive episodes they endured. It's important to note that, despite this self-perception, Becky's narrative indicates she was also a victim in the situation, caught between a desire to protect her children and the need to accommodate her husband's approach."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Oceania had milder weather and experienced common weather phenomena, while Lemuria experienced natural disasters. and a hint : On Earth, the common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere). Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.Weather occurs primarily due to air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place to another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity).

She said she did not feel isolated or scared since she had also received a lot of support with Twitter users pointing out that the stream of abuse directed at the activist contradicted the #SelfieWithDaughter tag, that many of them had been using. Ms Krishnan was not the only high-profile woman attacking Mr Modi's new initiative. Actress Shruti Seth also delivered a salvo of scathing tweets at the prime minister, asking him to \\"be more than a photograph\\". Like Ms Krishnan, Ms Seth was also at the receiving end of a wave of online abuse. She retweeted some of the more offensive ones and responded to a few. Mr Modi has a huge army of online followers, who fight many battles on his behalf, and react violently to any criticism of him. They were particularly active during his successful election campaign in 2014. Ms Krishnan's tweet was in reference to a 2013 incident entitled \\"snoopgate\\" by local media. Two news outlets said they had accessed audio recordings containing telephone conversations in which the president of the ruling BJP Amit Shah (then general secretary) was directing the illegal surveillance of a young woman in 2009. According to the recordings, the surveillance of the woman had been ordered by someone called \\"saheb\\" (sir) which was assumed to be a reference to Mr Modi, who was then the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat. The matter of illegal surveillance was taken up by the Supreme Court, which directed the petitioner to drop the \\"scandalous charges\\" against the prime minister. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"Ms. Krishnan, a woman from India, wrote a tweet about being careful with sharing selfies with daughters and the Prime Minister, Mr. Modi. The Prime Minister had asked people to send selfies with their daughters as part of a movement to save and educate girl children in India. Many people shared their pictures. But after Ms. Krishnan's tweet, some of Mr. Modi's supporters got very angry. They sent lots of mean messages to her on Twitter. Some even threatened her. She shared some of the meanest messages, saying they show how some men don't really support women. Ms. Krishnan and an actress named Shruti Seth criticized the Prime Minister's movement. They faced a lot of online abuse, but also got support from other people on Twitter. The Prime Minister has many online followers who react strongly to any criticism of him. Ms. Krishnan's tweet was about an incident in 2013, where Mr. Modi was said to be spying on a young woman. The Supreme Court had looked into this but told the person who brought it up to not say those things about the Prime Minister."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

At a St. Louis opera house in 1860, a singer in blackface named Jerry Barton, known as \\"King of the Minstrels\\", comes backstage and asks his sweetheart, Lettie Morgan, to elope. Lettie's Aunt Hortense, fearing that Barton is a fortune hunter, tells Lettie she is not the heiress she thought she was and that she has been living off her aunt's charity. With no fortune to hunt, Barton informs Lettie that an artist cannot be burdened with the responsibility of a wife. Outside the opera house, Lettie meets a chorus girl named Honey, who is preparing to leave with her theatrical troupe in a caravan heading West. When the troupe's producer mistakes Lettie for the star, she joins the group as \\"Mary Varden\\". The troupe's wagon train is escorted by Captain Tex Autry of the U.S. Cavalry and his singing plainsmen. The troupe misses the wagon train, however, and must travel alone. On their way to San Francisco, the caravan is ambushed by a gang of thieves. Tex and his men arrive on the scene and following a gunfight, the gang is chased off. After Tex saves Lettie from a runaway wagon, he comments on the foolishness of risking his men's lives for a bunch of \\"crazy showgirls\\". Angered by his insolence, Lettie decides to walk rather than ride with Tex. Eventually she gets tired and asks Tex if she can ride with him.

Solve this instance: The Democratic partyâs strategy for responding to the Al Franken scandal is now apparent: Taking up Frankenâs own hint in his apology statement there will be an âEthics Committee investigation.â Investigate what Senate Clouseaus? Franken has been caught on film. When Los Angeles radio host Leeann Tweeden said that during a 2006 USO tour Franken used his position as an entertainer to rope her into kissing him in the guise of a rehearsal for a sketch that was repellent enough. Franken âput his hand on the back of my head mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth â Tweeden said and Franken offered no specific alternative story only a lame suggestion that âI donât remember the rehearsal for the skit as Leeann does.â Is the Senate Ethics Committee going to invite Tweeden in to tell her story and try to nail down exactly what Franken claims happened? Is the Senate Ethics Committee going to issue an open call to any other women out there who may have similar claims about Franken to submit their testimony? I doubt it. The purpose of this phony investigation is to give the appearance of doing something while allowing time to pass and tempers to cool on the way to administering some meaningless reprimand to Franken . Franken might be able to shake this off if he could depend on conflicting memories. But he canât. Because of that photo. The sex-abuse scandal is becoming to cultural history what Watergate was to political history. It is gigantic. It is era-defining. And among the dozens of famous people implicated in it the Franken photo is the most damning and irrefutable evidence yet to emerge. Itâs a tableau of our time. It is the photo of our moment. Itâs the kind of smoking gun you couldnât use in a Law & Order episode because it would be too blatant. It will never disappear from the national consciousness. Consider the breathtaking way each detail reinforces the horror of the others: A Hollywood celebrity who will soon be a Democratic senator is molesting a woman. While sheâs asleep. And in military gear because sheâs traveling to support our troops. In a war zone. And Franken is smiling. While shamelessly posing for the photographer. How can we ever cease to be amazed and appalled by this photo? It is to the sex war what the picture of the summary execution of that Viet Cong prisoner was to the Vietnam War. Yet as the Senate circles the wagons around Franken itâs liberals and Democrats who should be angry â not Republicans. To Republicans itâs Thanksgiving come early. It makes no difference to the Republican policy agenda whether Franken or some other generic liberal Democrat holds that seat. If Franken remains Roy Mooreâs chances of victory in Alabama increase. It makes it too easy for Republicans in Alabama to say âWait a minute weâre supposed to end the career of Roy Moore a legend in this state when Democrats wonât expel Franken ? Why should we agree to unilateral ethics enforcement?â Should Moore make it to the Senate Democrats will be able to cast Republicans as the party of sex creeps only if they expel Franken . Every time Mooreâs name is mentioned the response will be âWhat about Al Franken ? And by the way what about Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy?â True in a certain sense this isnât fair. What Moore probably did is worse than what Franken admitted doing. But politics isnât fair. Whataboutism and crying hypocrisy arenât very strong moral arguments but theyâre easy to make and theyâre emotionally satisfying. And a photograph of obvious wrongdoing simply carries more salience than a verbal allegation â even if the allegation is credible and even if the behavior alleged is worse than that seen in the photo. Democrats who just this week were saying they would no longer tolerate Bill Clintonâtype behavior can prove it. They can make a clear break with the past by saying no more sexual misbehavior will be tolerated even by beloved party members. They could then leverage that moral clarity in 2018 to seek the votes of the married women who are wary about the liberal agenda but might be persuadable. Instead theyâre protecting their own. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand either can position herself as Americaâs leading tribune for women victimized by sexual assault or she can support keeping Franken in the Senate but not both. Her initial gambit â his apology isnât enough but âI expect to hear moreâ from Franken â is insufficient. What more is there for Franken to say now that he has admitted guilt and apologized? The Democrats are creating a three-word weapon with which the GOP will never stop beating them over the head: What. About. Franken.

A ‘Pitch,’ a swing, a miss This new drama imagines what it might be like for the first woman in Major League Baseball. Kylie Bunbury plays a pitcher who faces the sexism of sports culture and the pressure of being a groundbreaker. Early on, she overhears the guys trash-talking her through the vent system in the clubhouse. “She’s a gimmick,” the team captain (played by Mark-Paul Gosselaar) says with contempt. Meanwhile, her super-aggressive agent (Ali Larter) works hard to milk the moment. I wish this show were better, and less superficial, especially at a moment when another woman may be making headway in another male-dominated institution: the presidency. From Dan Fogelman, who’s also behind this season’s new “This Is Us” on NBC, the story relies far too heavily on clichés, obvious points, stereotypical characters, and, despite the approval and participation of Major League Baseball, an unrealistic atmosphere. That vent system bit, for example. Did the writers really need to give us that scene? Or, if they really had to re-re-emphasize the male players’ resistance to their new teammate, couldn’t they have come up with something better than the old heard-it-through-the-vent trick?

A:","completion":"Dane DeHaan played the title character in the 2017 3D film \\"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,\\" which was written and directed by Luc Besson. This science-fiction film is based on the French comic book series \\"Valérian and Laureline\\" by Pierre Christin and Jean-Claude Mézières. The film's story follows the adventures of the two main characters, Valerian (played by Dane DeHaan) and Laureline (played by Cara Delevingne), who are special operatives tasked with maintaining order throughout the human territories. The plot of \\"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets\\" revolves around the duo's mission to the metropolis of Alpha, an ever-expanding city known for its diverse array of species and cultures from different planets. In the movie, they are assigned to investigate a dark force that poses a grave threat to the peace and unity of Alpha. As they uncover the true nature of this threat, they also come across the larger conspiracy that may endanger the entire universe. Luc Besson, a renowned French filmmaker with a penchant for visually stunning and stylistic movies, adapted the screenplay for this film. He had been a fan of the Valérian comic series since his teenage years and had long desired to bring the story to the big screen. It took him almost a decade and advancements in filmmaking technology to finally realize his vision for this project. One significant aspect of \\"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets\\" is the high-quality visual effects and 3D elements, which make it an immersive and breathtaking experience for the audience. The movie enlisted the expertise of Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital, and Rodeo FX, among others, to create the stunning visuals that brought the futuristic world of Alpha and its inhabitants to life. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, who praised the film's visuals and action sequences yet found shortcomings in its storytelling and character development, \\"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets\\" remains a notable entry in the genre of science fiction cinema. In playing the lead role of Valerian, Dane DeHaan further expanded his diverse portfolio of work in film, demonstrating his ability to take on a wide range of roles as an actor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He is a supporting antagonist in the novel and is initially introduced as a blind beggar who serves as a messenger and recruiter for the pirate Captain Flint. Pew is a fearsome figure despite his blindness, characterized by his scraggly appearance, malevolence, and cruelty. As a skilled criminal, he uses his disability to his advantage, instilling fear and demanding respect from those around him. He carries a stick made of whalebone, which he utilizes as a weapon and for guidance, tapping the ground as he navigates his surroundings. Pew is first encountered when he delivers the Black Spot, a pirate summons marked with a black spot on one side and a message on the other, to a former member of Flint's crew named Billy Bones. The Black Spot is a pirate symbol of impending doom, in this case, a warning from Flint's former crewmates who are after the treasure map entrusted to Bones. Pew's actions eventually lead to the events of the story, as young Jim Hawkins finds the treasure map among Bones's belongings and embarks on an adventure along with Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and other important characters. Pew meets his demise towards the end of the novel when, after a failed attempt at acquiring the treasure map from Dr. Livesey and the other protagonists, he is accidentally trampled to death by a group of horsemen who come to the rescue. Overall, Pew's character is an embodiment of the treachery, violence, and danger associated with pirate life, adding an aura of suspense and villainy to the classic adventure tale 'Treasure Island'.

Japanese historians named it after the otherwise unrelated Warring States period in China. It came to an end when all political power was unified under the Tokugawa shogunate. - The Warring States period was an era in ancient Chinese history following the Spring and Autumn period and concluding with the Qin wars of conquest that saw the annexation of all other contender states, which ultimately led to the Qin state's victory in 221 BC as the first unified Chinese empire known as the Qin dynasty. Although different scholars point toward different dates ranging from 481 BC to 403 BC as the true beginning of the Warring States, Sima Qian's choice of 475 BC is generally the most often cited and popularly accepted one. The Warring States era also overlaps with the second half of the Eastern Zhou dynasty, though the Chinese sovereign, known as the king of Zhou, ruled merely as a figurehead and served as a backdrop against the machinations of the warring states. - Shinmen Sokan ( active 16th century ) was a Japanese lord , daimyo of the Shinmen clan ( Shinmen - shi ) during the middle of the Sengoku period .

Even though this was so , the Shinmen clan had very good ties with that of the Hirata family , leading to the Shinmen receiving a good amount of support . One such swordsman of note that served under Sokan was the famous Shinmen Munisai , the father of the legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi . In 1589 , Sokan ordered Munisai to kill Honiden Gekinosuke ( a minor student under Munisai ) for unknown reasons . Due to this fact however , Munisai was forced to leave his village of Miyamoto . - , also known as Shinmen Takez, Miyamoto Bennosuke or, by his Buddhist name, Niten Draku, was an expert Japanese swordsman and rnin.

Hyh Niten Ichi-ry is mainly known for the two-swordkatana and wakizashikenjutsu techniques Musashi called \\"Niten Ichi\\" (, \\"two heavens as one\\") or \\"Nit Ichi\\" (, \\"two swords as one\\"). - Originally named It Yagor, he at the age of fourteen found himself in a little seaside village called Izu. Legend tells that he floated across the Sagami Bay on a piece of driftwood from shima Island, part of the Izu Islands. The trust of the local villagers was earned when Yagor chased away a group of bandits that went around raiding and pillaging. As he desired to be a great swordsman, the villagers paid for Yagor's travels in seeking out a master. On his journey, Yagor reached Tsurugaoka Hachimang Shinto shrine in Kamakura where he paid homage to the gods and practiced his swordsmanship. One particular day, an unknown assailant tried to attack Yagor but he somehow unconsciously and without thinking drew his sword and cut him down in one swift stroke. Not understanding this technique, Yagor would later describe it as \\"Musken\\" (), a fundamental aspect of his swordsmanship's philosophy. Musken is either an offensive or defensive technique that is delivered spontaneously and without thinking, fully anticipating an opponent's movement; a type of extra-sensory perception similar to mushin. - A was a samurai with no lord or master during the feudal period (11851868) of Japan.

By adopting a healthy lifestyle, Tom reduced his risk of developing cancer, while Bill did not take preventive measures and was unfortunately diagnosed with the disease a year later. The background article emphasized the importance of making healthy lifestyle choices to prevent certain types of cancer and avoiding carcinogens, such as exposure to UV radiation, which increases the risk of skin cancer. Adopting a healthy lifestyle includes making choices such as not smoking, using sunscreen, maintaining a balanced diet, engaging in regular exercise, and limiting exposure to harmful substances like tobacco and alcohol. In the new situation, Tom chose to adopt a healthy lifestyle to minimize his risk of developing cancer. This decision demonstrates his awareness and commitment to making informed choices for the betterment of his health. On the other hand, Bill did not adhere to these preventive measures and faced the unfortunate consequence of being diagnosed with cancer. Thus, when answering the question, \\"Which of the two friends made healthier choices to prevent cancer?\\", the correct response is that Tom made healthier choices by adopting a lifestyle focused on cancer prevention and risk reduction, while Bill did not prioritize these measures, ultimately resulting in his diagnosis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you want to improve your communication with a family member or friend who is deaf? Do you want to be able to communicate with deaf people in general? Would you like to advance in your career by being able to communicate in ASL? Do you want to be a Sign Language interpreter? Sign language is not just a random collection of gestures but a full-blown language in its own right, complete with its own grammatical rules. Each country or region has its own sign language, as different from each other as English is from Spanish. Each version of sign language is somewhat linked to the spoken language in its region. For example, American sign language does share similarities with English, even though it is its own language. The advantages of knowing sign language in addition to a spoken language are many. Communication becomes possible on many levels with the deaf community, with other people either hearing or not in any of the above situations, as well as many more. While other languages take years to learn, American Sign Language can be taught in a much shorter time period. It is one of the easiest languages to learn because most of the signs were developed to mimic the actual word or phrase it is representing. Even the alphabet signs look like the letters of the English alphabet. American Sign Language, or ASL, is the third most used language in the United States. Used by the deaf community, interpreters, and friends and family of the deaf. There are a lot of sites on the internet that not only shows you the sign with video, but will help you practice reading signs as well. Teaching even hearing babies sign language seems to be the fashion in recent years and for good reason. Communicating in sign language is fun and natural as babies naturally use body gestures in early communication. Teaching baby sign language actually appears to enhance the learning of verbal skills and brain development of the children involved.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Stop that splitting headache About once a month, usually around my period, I start feeling sort of…off. My neck gets tight and achy, and I can't think as clearly as usual, like my mental gears are gummed up. That slow-brain feeling, I've learned over the years, is not a good sign. It means I'm about to get a migraine. It's my cue to be careful—to steer clear of red wine and sugar, two sure triggers when I'm in that sensitive state, and to get enough rest since lack of sleep can tip me over the edge, too. Even so, if anything in my routine is out of whack—if I don't eat often enough, or if I become overly stressed—I can count on one or two days of misery. Head-pounding, nauseated, verge-of-tears misery. Sound bad? Compared to many of the 30 million migraine sufferers in the U.S., my experience is fairly mild. Several years ago, the massive American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study found that half of those who struggle with migraines can't do household chores and a third forgo family or social activities. That's a whole lot of agony, and it affects three times as many women as men, largely because the ups and downs of our hormones seem to make us more susceptible, according to Dr. Andrew Charles, professor and director of the UCLA School of Medicine's Headache Research and Treatment Program. A migraine isn't just a headache; it's a neurological disorder, often inherited, in which triggers ranging from stress to certain foods to even changes in the weather set off a chain reaction in the brain that results in intense pain. Most migraine sufferers are between the ages of 20 and 50—women in full-speed-ahead career/family/juggling mode. We're talking about multitaskers who definitely can't afford a day or two (or more) of feeling cruddy. And yet most don't get effective treatment, even though there are plenty of options. \\"Many people still don't know what migraines are or that there's good help available,\\" said Dr. Stewart Tepper, a headache specialist at the Cleveland Clinic's Center for Headache and Pain. In fact, many women don't even realize that they've got migraines in the first place. The truth is, most bad headaches—the ones that make getting through the day a chore or make you feel nauseated or sensitive to light—are the Big M. \\"They're more common than we used to think,\\" Charles said. \\"Nearly 48 percent of all women will have a migraine at some point in their lives.\\" Although tension headaches affect more people, they're far less debilitating and easier to deal with. Studies have found that most people who complain to their doctors about headaches have migraines—as do nearly 90 percent of people who think they have sinus headaches. That's why it's so important to understand migraines—why we get them, what triggers them, how to prevent them, and the most effective ways to treat them at every stage. The best migraine defense is a good offense—stopping it before it starts. \\"One of the most effective things you can do is maintain regular habits and try to keep your life on an even keel,\\" said Dr. Peter Goadsby, director of the University of California–San Francisco Headache Clinic. Eat, sleep, and exercise regularly (studies have shown that both cardio and stretching are effective at reducing headaches), and try to control your stress, since that is the number-one migraine trigger. Lifestyle changes. Two options proven to help: biofeedback and cognitive behavioral therapy. With biofeedback training, technicians attach electrodes to your head and neck to measure muscle tension and relaxation, so you not only learn to recognize those states but to control them. And in cognitive behavioral therapy, you learn relaxation strategies, like meditation. \\"You get about a 55 percent reduction in headache frequency, on average, with behavioral approaches,\\" said Donald Penzien, director of the Head Pain Center at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, \\"so long as you make an effort to put the techniques into practice.\\" Training costs between 70 and 250 a session, but it's usually covered by insurance. And when Penzien and his colleagues studied the cost of behavioral therapies a few years ago, they found that most people learn the techniques in just a few sessions. 13 Surprising Ways to Fight Headache Pain 18 Signs You're Having a Migraine Supplements. Consider taking a supplement as a preventive measure if your headaches are disabling—even if you only have one or two a month. Since different options work for different people, you may need to try several before finding the one that's most effective for you: Butterbur (or Petasites root) is an herb that can help reduce the frequency of attacks, possibly by reducing inflammation. Researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine found that people who took 75 milligrams twice a day had about half as many migraines as usual over a four-month period. Vitamin B2, or riboflavin, reduced headache frequency from four per month to two in a German trial—possibly because it speeds up brain metabolism, which seems to be beneficial for those with migraines. \\"The effective dose is 400 milligrams per day,\\" Goadsby said. Coenzyme Q10 is a vitamin-like substance found in meats and seafood. It, too, may boost the brain's energy metabolism. Research shows a dose of 100 milligrams three times a day can decrease the frequency of headaches by about 50 percent. Magnesium is an element that's involved in a variety of bodily functions, and there's some evidence that low levels can trigger migraines. \\"A dose of 300 to 500 milligrams a day might help,\\" Charles said. Medication. \\"If you have several disabling attacks a month, and you can't control the pain, talk to your doctor about using preventive medication on a daily basis,\\" Goadsby said. Options include: Beta-blockers normally used to treat high blood pressure, such as propranolol (sold as Inderal) and timolol (sold as Blocadren), help prevent headaches likely because they help improve blood flow. Antiseizure drugs topiramate (sold as Topamax) and valproic acid (sold as Depakote) may reduce your migraines because epilepsy and migraines are caused by similar reactions in the brain. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline are used for migraine prevention because they regulate levels of the feel-good chemical serotonin in the brain, and it's believed that serotonin may play a role in the development of migraines. Botox injections are approved for use in people with chronic migraines (headaches more than 15 days a month). They help people have fewer headaches and less painful headaches, possibly because Botox affects the facial nerves that play a role in migraines, according to Goadsby. As it starts: Nip it in the bud Sometimes, catching an attack in the pre-head-pain phase, known as prodrome, can prevent a full-blown headache. Not everyone has early-warning symptoms, but a 2004 study at the Headache Center of Atlanta found that about a third of people experienced signs like feeling tired and moody or having diarrhea and neck pain about eight hours before their migraine set in. Lifestyle changes. Because stress is the most common migraine trigger, you might be able to stave off a headache by taking a few minutes to decompress, Penzien said. Try five minutes of diaphragmatic breathing: Lie on your back with a pillow beneath your head and another under your knees, so your legs are slightly bent. (You can also do this sitting in a chair.) Put your right hand on your upper chest and your left just below your rib cage. Breathe in slowly through your nose so your stomach pushes up against your left hand. Then, as you exhale, blowing out through pursed lips, tighten your stomach muscles and let them fall inward. Your right hand should remain as still as possible through the inhale and exhale. Medication. A pair of recent studies looked at treating migraine during the pre-headache stage and found it was at least moderately effective in heading off an attack, so it makes sense to talk to your doctor about taking a triptan, such as Imitrex. These drugs (if appropriate for you, your doc will give you an Rx and determine the best dose) reduce inflammation and constrict blood vessels in the brain. You can also try an over-the-counter pain med such as ibuprofen (400 to 600 milligrams). During the migraine: Treat it Though it's better to prevent a headache than try to get rid of it, that's not always possible. Fortunately, there are good options for managing the pain when you're hit by a migraine. Medication. \\"All medications work better when you take them early in the attack—within 30 minutes of when you feel the headache coming on, whether you're actually feeling pain yet or not,\\" Tepper said. \\"Also, you have to be careful not to use any medications more than 10 days a month, because you run the risk of transforming your periodic headaches into a chronic condition.\\" OTC nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like naproxen and ibuprofen inhibit blood vessel inflammation, so they can reduce the pain, as can simple analgesics like aspirin or acetaminophen. Another good option: drugs (like Excedrin) that combine acetaminophen and aspirin with caffeine, which narrows blood vessels and increases the effectiveness of pain relievers. Triptans are the best prescription option for treating migraines, but because they constrict blood vessels, you can't use them if you have a history of heart attack or stroke. Dihydroergotamine (sold as Migranal) is a new Rx nasal spray or injection that tightens blood vessels in the brain. Studies show it reduces nausea and sensitivity to light and sound as well as pain. Lifestyle changes. Rest. If you can do it, relax in a dark, quiet room at the first sign of a headache—either during the aura phase or the second the pain hits. Stretch your neck by tilting your head gently to one side for 10 seconds, then the other. \\"Neck tightness and discomfort are common symptoms, so stretching might provide a little relief,\\" said Charles. Relax. Try yoga or progressive muscle relaxation (in which you tighten, then relax one group of muscles at a time, starting at your calves and working up to shoulders). Because of the connection between migraine and stress, relaxing can make a big difference.

The Hut Point and Cape Evans huts remain, protected by the Antarctic Heritage Trust and the New Zealand government. Within the Cape Evans hut an inscription by Richards on the wall near his bunk, listing the names of those lost, can still be read, but the generally deteriorating condition of the huts has caused concern.The Aurora survived for less than a year after her final return from the Ross Sea. Shackleton had sold her for £10,000, and her new role was as a coal-carrier between Australia and South America. She disappeared in the Pacific Ocean, on or about 2 January 1918, having either foundered in a storm or been sunk by an enemy raider. Aboard her was James Paton of the Ross Sea ship's party, who was still serving as her boatswain. Ernest Wild was also a victim of the First World War. He died of typhoid in Malta, on 10 March 1918, while serving with the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean.On 4 July 1923, Joyce and Richards were awarded Albert Medals by George V for their bravery and life-saving efforts during the second depot-laying journey. Wild and Victor Hayward received the same award, posthumously. Many of the survivors enjoyed long and successful careers. The young wireless operator, Lionel Hooke, joined Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Ltd and was responsible for many technological innovations. He became the company's managing director in 1945 and its chairman in 1962, having been knighted for services to industry in 1957. Of the four dogs who survived the trek, Con was killed by the other dogs in a fight before the rescue. The others, Oscar, Gunner and Towser, returned in the ship to New Zealand and were placed in Wellington Zoo, where Oscar lived, allegedly, to the age of 25.

What is creativity? How de we define creativity? Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us. Maybe creativity to you is 90% unique idea, 5% skill and 5% hard work. Maybe creativity to you is 40% unique idea, 50% skill and 10% hard work. Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from? Is it simply random? Is it a gift from the gods? Is our unique idea just a product of a lot of subconscious effort, only made aware to us in the sense of a ‘random’ idea? Have we been influenced by something, processed it... Question: What does creativity seem to be to most people? === The answer to the above question is Available choices: (A). Something that doesn't involve any hard work at all. (B). not enough information. (C). A random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work. (D). The ability to make or produce something.","completion":"(C). A random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work. Creativity seems to be a combination of various elements for most people. It often involves a unique idea or vision, which could spontaneously occur or be the result of some subconscious process. This idea is then combined with the necessary skills and hard work to bring it to fruition. The philosophical aspect of creativity lies in its inherently subjective nature, as it varies from person to person and depends on one's unique perspective, experiences, and influences. Some view creativity primarily as a natural gift, while others may view it more as a learned skill that can be nurtured through practice and open-mindedness. Furthermore, creativity, as a broad concept, transcends various disciplines—from arts and literature to science and technology. It lies in the heart of human endeavors and problem-solving, allowing individuals to come up with solutions that are inventive, innovative, and unique. In this sense, creativity contributes significantly to human progress and growth. Creativity can be seen as a unique combination of individual traits, cognitive processes, and contextual factors. Neuroscience and psychology have attempted to explain the sources of creativity, and their research suggests that it arises from an intricate web of connections throughout the brain. These connections may involve the engagement of various cognitive processes such as memory, perception, and associative thinking, which work together in synergy. The question of whether everyone's creativity is different could be approached from the perspective that, indeed, every individual has a unique combination of traits, experiences, and perspectives that shape their creative potential. It is essential to recognize that creativity is not a fixed, monolithic concept, and it can manifest in various forms and degrees throughout various domains. To sum up, creativity is a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon that hinges on a person's individual perspective, cognitive processes, and contextual factors. Our understanding of creativity can be enriched by investigating it from philosophical, psychological, and neurological perspectives, allowing for a more profound appreciation of its essential role in human life and progress."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"A second biotechnology district is being planned for the median strip on Frontage Road, on land cleared for the never-built Route 34 extension.

He was the founder of the Soviet Union and the first leader of the newly formed state, serving as the head of government from 1917 until his death in 1924. Lenin was important for several reasons: 1. Leading the Bolshevik Revolution: Lenin led the Bolshevik Party in the October Revolution of 1917, overthrowing the Provisional Government and establishing socialist rule in Russia. This event marked the beginning of the Russian Civil War and eventually led to the formation of the Soviet Union. 2. Founding the Soviet Union: As the leader of the Bolshevik Party, Lenin played a crucial role in the creation of the Soviet Union in 1922, which united various nationalities under a communist government. 3. Developing Marxism-Leninism theory: Lenin's interpretation of Marxism, known as Marxism-Leninism, became the dominant political ideology in the Soviet Union. It combined Marx's ideas of dialectical materialism and class struggle with Lenin's theories about the role of the vanguard party, imperialism, and the dictatorship of the proletariat. 4. Implementing socialist policies: As the leader of the Soviet government, Lenin implemented significant socialist policies, including wealth redistribution, nationalization of industries, and the establishment of collective farms, which changed the economic structure and social organization of Russia. 5. Impact on global politics: Lenin's success inspired other socialist and communist movements worldwide. The existence of the Soviet Union as a global power until its collapse in 1991, played a significant role in shaping international politics during the 20th century, particularly during the Cold War, when it was in direct competition with the United States and its capitalist allies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Entomologist Susan Tyler uses genetic engineering to create what her colleague (and husband) Peter Mann and she call the Judas breed, a large insect that releases an enzyme which causes the roaches metabolism to speed up and starve themselves to death. It successfully kills off the disease. The released population was all-female and designed with a lifespan of only a few months, so that it would only last one generation. Three years later, a reverend is chased and dragged underground by a strange assailant. The only witness is Chuy, the \\"special\\" ward of an immigrant subway shoe-shiner named Manny.

Peter, CDC officer Josh and subway cop Leonard enter the maintenance tunnels to investigate but Peter and Leonard get separated from Josh, who is then killed trying to find his way back up. Susan is taken from the train platform by one of the creatures and brought into the tunnels. Manny also enters the tunnels in search of Chuy and comes across Susan, whom he rescues along with Peter and Leonard, before they barricade themselves in a train car. Susan surmises that the Judas' accelerated metabolism has allowed it to reproduce and that they have evolved to mimic their human prey. The group formulates a plan to get the car moving: Peter will switch the power on, and Manny will switch the tracks. Susan projects that the Judas will spread throughout the tunnels unless they are able to kill the single fertile male. Manny finds Chuy but is killed by the male Judas, so Susan goes in search of him but finds only Chuy.

They agreed on a strategy to sequence the genome of cultivated, tetraploid cotton. \\"Tetraploid\\" means that cultivated cotton actually has two separate genomes within its nucleus, referred to as the A and D genomes. The sequencing consortium first agreed to sequence the D-genome relative of cultivated cotton (G. raimondii, a wild Central American cotton species) because of its small size and limited number of repetitive elements. It is nearly one-third the number of bases of tetraploid cotton (AD), and each chromosome is only present once.[clarification needed] The A genome of G. arboreum would be sequenced next. Its genome is roughly twice the size of G. raimondii's. Part of the difference in size between the two genomes is the amplification of retrotransposons (GORGE). Once both diploid genomes are assembled, then research could begin sequencing the actual genomes of cultivated cotton varieties. This strategy is out of necessity; if one were to sequence the tetraploid genome without model diploid genomes, the euchromatic DNA sequences of the AD genomes would co-assemble and the repetitive elements of AD genomes would assembly independently into A and D sequences respectively. Then there would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.

They chose two kinds: one is called G. raimondii and the other is G. arboreum. They will first study G. raimondii because it has a smaller genome, and then they'll move on to G. arboreum, which has a bigger genome. Now, the tricky part comes when they study the more complicated cotton plants, called tetraploid cotton. To understand these plants better, they need something to compare them with. That's when they use the simpler cotton plants, G. raimondii and G. arboreum, as a comparison.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: By. Hannah Roberts. Pope Francis has confessed that he fell in love with a girl that he met when he was training to be a priest. After a week-long fixation, the Latin pontiff then aged 22 or 23 had to seek redemption in the confession booth, he revealed. In an extraordinary interview to celebrate his first year in the Catholic church’s top job, Francis revealed that ‘there was a girl that turned my head for a week when I was at the seminary.’ Holy secret: Pope Francis, pictured in the Vatican today, has revealed that he had to seek redemption in the confession booth, after falling in love with a woman when he was at the seminary in his early 20s. He said: ‘But we were young.’ He added mischievously: ‘I tell my confessor about these things.’ The Argentinian pontiff seems to have had no problem attracting the ladies in his youth. Pope Francis has said he is finding the growing ‘Superpope’ hype that surrounds him offensive. In an interview published to mark his first anniversary as pontiff, he said that he dislikes the media painting a picture of him as a celebrity and a star. However, in stark contrast, the Vatican is marking the anniversary of his election with commemorative stamps and coins and a DVD with never-before-seen footage of the pope. Francis told Italian daily Corriere della: ‘Depicting the pope as a sort of Superman, a star, is offensive to me. ‘The pope is a man who laughs, cries, sleeps calmly and has friends like everyone else. A normal person.’ He has previously revealed that he had a girlfriend when he was 17, that he used to go dancing with in salsa clubs. However his vocation to the priesthood was too strong. On a night out with friends in Buenos Aires, the youngster stopped to go to confession when his decision to join the priesthood came upon him. And after he became pope, a long lost childhood love came forward. Former neighbour Amalia Damonte told how their families had divided them after the then Jorge Maria Bergoglio had sworn to marry her, aged 12. In the anniversary interview, Francis also revealed that former Pope Benedict XVI was to come out of retirement. Loved: Pope Francis waves at the crowd upon his arrival at St.Peter's square for the weekly general audience on Wednesday. The papa: Pope Francis joked with the crowd and even put on a military Alpine hat as the interview about his week-long love story was published. Big wave: The interview, done in the anniversary of his ascent to Pope, also saw him reveal that his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI will come out of retirement. After becoming the first Pope in 600. years to resign a year ago, Benedict was forced to commit to a. cloistered life, remaining ‘hidden from the world’. In the interview, Pope Francis defended the Catholic Church’s record on child abuse saying that it had done much since the scandal first broke some 15 years ago and was being singled out for attack. He defended the Church and his predecessor former Pope Benedict, whom Francis credited with having the courage to start reforms. ‘On this path, the Church has done much, perhaps more than all others,’ he said. ‘The Catholic Church is perhaps the only public institution that has moved with transparency and responsibility. 'No-one has done more, and yet the Church is the only one that is being attacked,’ he said. He appeared to be referring to a report by a United Nations committee last month which accused the Vatican of systematically turning a blind eye to decades of sexual abuse of children by priests, and demanded it turn over known or suspected offenders to civil justice. A ‘shadow Pope’ lurking would become a rallying point for opposition to Francis and risk splitting the Catholic Church, many in the Curia or Vatican civil service feared. But Francis said that his predecessor still had a lot to offer, and was like ‘a granddad who didn’t deserve to be put in an old people’s home.’ ‘We discussed it and decided together that it’s best that he sees people and goes out and rejoins church life’, he told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. ‘Some wanted him to retire to a Benedictine monastery far from the Vatican. 'But it made me think of granddads who strengthen the family with their knowledge and advice and don’t deserve to be put in an old people’s home.’ Francis appeared to pave the way for his own eventual retirement saying that although Benedict was the first, Pope Emeritus, or retired Pope, the position would become routine. ‘It should be an institution, he said. ‘He [Benedict] is the first and perhaps there will be others’, he hinted.

I know that the answer to the question \\"How does the bacteria get acquired resistance?\\" is in \\"Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist. Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.\\".

Article: Whenever someone begins to talk to me about how horrible it is to eat meat and suggests that a nice piece of tofu would be just as good, I just smile and show them those nice pointy teeth we all have in the corners of our mouths. They are called canines , and they are there only for the purpose of eating meat. When it comes to satisfying this kind of desire, soy food can never match a well-prepared tri-tip (also know as triangle beef steak ). Just the thought of the beef, burning on the grill with the smell of wood smoke gets the mouth watering and brings back memories of summer barbecues. When the knife cuts through the tri- tip, exposing the red meat bursting with juices, it's more than just cooking. It's a cultural event, showing we are at the top of the food chain, like no other food can. Nutritionally speaking, the tri-tip is one of the better cuts of beef. It is lower in fat than many other cuts, and the proteins you get from eating meat are more complete than those that come from vegetables, making meat a better choice for building and keeping up your muscle tissue healthy. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, one thing to be aware of with soy products in general is that while they are high in iron, a necessary mineral for the body, they also contain something that blocks the body's absorption of iron. We can cook them in various ways to make them tasty. Anyway, the tri-tip goes a lot better with ice-cold beer than a large piece of bean-curd cheese would, no matter how you cook it. I guess I should say at least e good thing about tofu. If you cook it just right, you can make it taste a little like the tri-tip, but only a little. Question: Compared with tofu, the tri-tip is _ . Options: A: more nutritious but poorer in proteins B: higher in iron and other useful minerals C: more beneficial for muscle development D: harder for eaters to take in its iron The answer is:","completion":"C: more beneficial for muscle development. Step 1: Read the article and understand the key points. Step 2: Identify the comparison points between tofu and tri-tip in the article. Step 3: Evaluate the information given about tri-tip and tofu as related to each option. Justification: Option A is incorrect because the article states that proteins from meat are more complete than those from vegetables, which implies that tri-tip has better proteins rather than poorer proteins as compared to tofu. Option B is incorrect because the article only mentions that soy products (tofu) are high in iron, but does not mention that tri-tip is higher in iron or other minerals. Option C is correct because the article states that meat proteins are more complete as compared to those from vegetables, meaning tri-tip will be more beneficial for muscle development than tofu. Option D is incorrect because the article says that soy products - like tofu - have substances that block the body's absorption of iron, but doesn't attribute that issue to tri-tip."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Many politicians, including the President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, are of the view that a political party's performance in Istanbul is more significant than its general performance overall. This is due to the city's role as Turkey's financial centre, its large electorate and the fact that Erdoğan himself was elected Mayor of Istanbul in 1994. In the run-up to local elections in 2019, Erdoğan claimed 'if we fail in Istanbul, we will fail in Turkey'.Historically, Istanbul has voted for the winning party in general elections since 1995. Since 2002, the right-wing Justice and Development Party (AKP) has won pluralities in every general election, with 41.74% of the vote in the most recent parliamentary election on 24 June 2018. Erdoğan, the AKP's presidential candidate, received exactly 50.0% of the vote in the presidential election held on the same day. Starting with Erdoğan in 1994, Istanbul has had a conservative mayor for 25 years, until 2019. The second largest party in Istanbul is the centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP), which is also the country's main opposition. The left-wing pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) is the city's third largest political force due to a substantial number of Kurdish people migrating from south-eastern Turkey. More recently, Istanbul and many of Turkey's metropolitan cities are following a trend away from the government and their right-wing ideology. In 2013 and 2014, large-scale anti-AKP government protests began in İstanbul and spread throughout the nation. This trend first became evident electorally in the 2014 mayoral election where the centre-left opposition candidate won an impressive 40% of the vote, despite not winning. The first government defeat in Istanbul occurred in the 2017 constitutional referendum, where Istanbul voted 'No' by 51.4% to 48.6%. The AKP government had supported a 'Yes' vote and won the vote nationally due to high support in rural parts of the country.... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who won the vote with 48.77% in 2019?, what is it ? Answer:","completion":"The article does not provide the first name of the person who won the vote with 48.77% in 2019."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Plumerias require temperatures of at least 65 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 18 to 27 degrees Celsius). They will not survive in temperatures below 55 degrees Fahrenheit (about 13 degrees Celsius). Any parts of the plant exposed to freezing temperatures will die. Therefore, it is important to choose the right location. If your climate regularly or seasonally gets colder than 55 degrees Fahrenheit (about 13 degrees Celsius), do not plant your plumeria in the ground outside. Instead, plant it in a container that you can keep inside when it gets cold. Even though plumerias have strict temperature requirements, they are flexible in that they can flourish outside or inside. Plumerias can survive in very hot temperatures, even over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (about 38 degrees Celsius). Plumerias grow best in full sunlight, which is at least 6 hours a day. Find a location where the tree will be exposed to regular sunlight. Plumerias grow well in greenhouses or near a big window with lots of light if you are growing it inside. If planting your plumeria outside, you can plant it in a pot or in the ground. If planting plumerias in the ground, they will need to be planted 10 to 20 feet apart so that their roots have adequate space to grow. You can plant a root ball in a hole that is the same depth as the roots, but 2 to 3 times the width. Choose a planting location where the soil drains well and water doesn't puddle after a rainfall. Avoid locations where the plumeria will be exposed to heat radiating off a brick or concrete wall. Planting your plumeria in a container is useful so that you can move it inside if it gets cold. Or you can simply grow your plumeria inside year-round. If planting your plumeria in a container, be sure to use one with a hole or several holes in the bottom to provide soil and water drainage, as a plumeria won't do well with wet feet. Use at least a one gallon size container so that it has adequate room to grow. Black nursery containers are preferable to clay pots because of the porous nature of clay, which allows roots to be embedded in the walls and moisture to escape too quickly. You can find black nursery containers at your local gardening store. Plastic pots are another good option because they lack the porousness of clay. Since one of the biggest hazards to plumerias is overwatering, make sure your soil is fast draining, like cactus mix. If it is too dense or fine, it will hold too much water. Coarse soil will help ensure adequate drainage. Choose one with a slightly acidic pH as well, from around 6 to 6.7. To make sure your soil will drain properly, you can mix it with some perlite or sand. Soil can be found at your local gardening store. If you are planting your plumeria outside, make sure the soil drains well by mixing it with an organic material like manure or peat. If you don’t want to plant your own plumeria, you can buy one already grown. Purchase a healthy plumeria tree at a local nursery. Select a compact plumeria plant with even, bright color and a sturdy, straight trunk. Look for evenly spaced branches. Avoid plants with wilted leaves or poor color. Summary:","completion":"Plumerias are plants that need a warm temperature, between 65 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 27 degrees Celsius). They cannot live in very cold weather. If it's too cold, you should plant your plumeria in a big pot and keep it inside. Plumerias like lots of sunlight and warm places. Make sure they are not too close to each other when you plant them, and choose a spot where water doesn't stay after it rains. When planting in a pot, pick one with holes for water to come out, and use special soil that drains well. It's important not to give plumerias too much water. If you don't want to plant your own, you can buy a healthy plumeria from a garden store."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Half Nelson Movie plot: Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling) is a young inner-city high school teacher whose ideals wither and die in the face of reality. Day after day in his shabby Brooklyn classroom, he somehow finds the energy to inspire his 13 and 14-years-old to examine everything from civil rights to the civil war with a new enthusiasm. Rejecting the standard curriculum in favor of an edgier approach, Dan teaches his students how change workson both a historical and personal scaleand how to think for themselves.Though Dan is brilliant, dynamic and in control of the classroom, he spends his time outside school on the edge of consciousness. Early in the film we see Dan smoking crack in a school locker room after he coaches the school's girls basketball team. While there, one of his players, Drey (Shareeka Epps) catches him getting high. As the plot moves forward, we learn little about how or why Dan got involved with drugs. We find that a former girlfriend has successfully gone through drug rehab, and that the Dunne family has fissures of its own. But Fleck primarily sets moods throughout the film, leaving large ellipses for the viewer to fill in, rather than directly illuminate Dan's story.Drey's troubles are more plainly spelled out. Her parents are not together, and her father is irresponsible and seemingly uninvolved in her life. Drey's brother, Mike, is in prison for selling drugs for a neighborhood dealer, Frank (Anthony Mackie). And Drey's mother is constantly working as an EMT to keep the family together. Drey's lack of proper adult supervision make her a target for Frank's operation.The tension in the film comes from Drey's attempts to save Dan from the consequences of his drug habit, and Dan's efforts to keep Drey from following in her brother Mike's footsteps. These two people are better able to save each other than to save themselves. Answer:","completion":"Dan is seen smoking crack, which is an illegal drug."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this sentence, all the spaces between words have been removed as requested. The original sentence described the elegant and delicate flavor profile of the white Chardonnay grape, which is known for its notes of white flowers such as white cast iron and acacia, as well as white fruits like apple, pear, and various citrus fruits. The popularity of Chardonnay as a grape variety can be attributed to its versatility and ability to produce a wide range of wine styles, from crisp, mineral-driven wines with high acidity to rich, full-bodied wines with buttery, oaky flavors. Chardonnay grapes thrive in a wide range of climates and soil types, making it one of the most widely planted grape varieties worldwide. The grape variety is commonly used to produce a diverse array of white wines, including still, sparkling, and dessert wines, and is a primary grape in the production of Champagne. The wine's characteristics can vary depending on the region it is grown in and the winemaking techniques used, allowing Chardonnay to express itself in a multitude of styles. In cooler climates, such as Chablis in France, Chardonnay tends to produce wines with high acidity and more mineral-driven flavors. These wines often have a distinct flintiness and are typically aged in stainless steel or neutral oak barrels, preserving the freshness and purity of the grape's fruit flavors. Green apple, pear, and citrus notes are common in these types of Chardonnay wines. In warmer climates, such as California and Australia, Chardonnay grapes can develop riper fruit flavors, giving the resulting wines a more lush, tropical fruit profile. Melon, pineapple, and ripe peach notes are often found in Chardonnays from these regions. Winemakers may also choose to age these wines in new oak barrels, imparting further flavors such as vanilla, toast, and butter, resulting in a rich, full-bodied wine. The versatility of Chardonnay has also made it a popular choice for blending with other grape varieties. The most famous example of blended Chardonnay is its role as one of the main components in Champagne and other sparkling wines from around the world, where it is often blended with Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. Chardonnay lends these wines its signature acidity and structure, while the other grape varieties contribute their unique flavors and textures. In conclusion, Chardonnay is a diverse and adaptable grape variety that can produce a wide range of wine styles, from elegant and mineral-driven wines with high acidity to rich and buttery wines with ripe fruit flavors. Its ability to thrive in different climates and its desirable taste profile have made it one of the most widely planted grape varieties in the world, and its elegant notes of white flowers, white fruits, and citrus fruits have made it a favorite among wine enthusiasts for generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who moved to Sedbergh School in 1827, where he remained for two years? Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe. His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836.

By knowing the ship's direction, sailors could maintain a steady course and avoid deviating from their intended path. 3. Celestial navigation: This technique involves using the positions of the stars, sun, and moon to determine the vessel's latitude and longitude. By observing these celestial bodies and their positions, navigators could determine their position on the Earth. 4. Nautical charts: Accurate and up-to-date charts provided mariners with information on safe routes, ocean currents, prominent coastal features, and locations of hazards such as shoals or reefs. Having a good set of charts allowed sailors to plan their voyages more effectively. 5. Log and line: A log and line was a simple device for measuring a ship's speed through the water. The \\"log\\" was a wooden or metal object that was thrown into the water, attached to a long line with evenly spaced knots. As the ship moved through the water, a sailor would count the number of knots that passed through their fingers over a certain period (usually measured with an hourglass). This measurement allowed the crew to track their progress and estimate the remaining time to reach their destination. Of these options, the best aids for crossing the sea in the 18th century would be a combination of the sextant, compass, celestial navigation, nautical charts, and the log and line. By using these tools and techniques, sailors could effectively navigate their vessels across the open ocean."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Here are the given strings: String A: iShkZCMrstWmlqBHaApVI String B: SxfeYYTmGZCMrstWmlqClf To find the longest common substring, follow these simple steps: 1. Understand the problem: The goal is to find the longest sequence of characters that is present in both strings A and B. 2. Compare the strings: Start by comparing characters of both strings. You can start from the first character of string A and look for the same character in string B. If you find the character, check for the next character in both strings until the characters do not match. 3. Keep track of the longest common substring and its length: Whenever you find a common substring, compare its length with the length of the longest common substring found so far. If the new substring's length is longer, then update the longest common substring and its length. 4. Continue this process: Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all characters in string A, comparing them with each character in string B. 5.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Two packs of lions were hunting large herbivores. The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers. Which pack was preying more upon herds? Hint: Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Mobutu pack was preying more upon herds. Here's a step-by-step analysis of each pack's hunting behavior and why the Mobutu pack is more focused on herds: 1. The Simba pack primarily targets wounded individual prey animals. While these animals might be part of a herd, the Simba pack's hunting tactic revolves around identifying and ambushing vulnerable individual targets rather than focusing on the entire group. 2. The Mobutu pack, on the other hand, follows large groups of zebras and other grazers. This means that their hunting strategy relies on staying close to or following entire herds, which implies a focus on herds while hunting. 3. The hint given refers to how predators may have difficulty attacking individual animals in large groups, such as zebras. This suggests that the Mobutu pack, which follows herds of zebras and grazers, is more likely to face the challenges of a predator confusing in the context of large herds. 4. Martin Stevens and his colleagues' research on the zebra's diverse striped patterns causing confusion among predators supports the idea that targeting herds is more challenging for predators. This further reinforces that the Mobutu pack, which focuses on large groups, is preying more upon herds. In conclusion, based on the hunting strategies of both packs and the hint provided, the Mobutu pack is preying more upon herds as they follow large groups of zebras and other grazers, thus facing the challenges associated with hunting within large group settings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It follows the tragic death of a 21-year-old woman who suffered a fatal blood clot after she was prescribed the contraceptive pill. Fallan Kurek, who worked as a teaching assistant with children with learning disabilities, was prescribed Rigevidon by her GP to regulate her periods. Thousands of women across Northern Ireland take the pill daily to regulate periods, reduce painful periods and to protect from pregnancy. The pill can also be used to treat acne. Derry GP, Dr Tom Black from the British Medical Association, said: “I think it is fair to say that the pill has been used for decades and the formulations we are using now in terms of hormones are a lower dose than would have been many years ago. “Obviously, you need to be careful and take professional advice, particularly those patients who are overweight, older or those who smoke. “There are those people who can’t use the pill but overall there have been millions of prescriptions for the pill and most people can use it safely.” Ms Kurek had been taking the pill for just 25 days when she collapsed at her home in Staffordshire in England. BPM Fallan Kurek's parents, Brian and Julia Kurek Paramedics rushed to her house after she began vomiting – but minutes later she stopped breathing and turned blue. She was rushed to hospital but died three days later on May 14. A postmortem found she died as a result of a pulmonary embolism – a blockage in the lung normally caused by a blood clot. According to the NHS, there is a very low risk of serious side effects from taking the contraceptive pill, such as blood clots and cervical cancer. Rigevidon is a combined oral contraceptive pill used to prevent pregnancy. Each tablet contains two types of female sex hormones – oestrogen and a progesterone in low doses. Contraceptive pills that contain two hormones are called combined oral contraceptive pills. The combined pill is not suitable for women over 35 who smoke, or women with certain medical conditions, such as those who have suffered migraines. ||||| The combined oral contraceptive pill is usually just called \\"the pill\\". It contains artificial versions of female hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which women produce naturally in their ovaries. A woman can get pregnant if a man's sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening usually by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping the release of an egg (ovulation). Facts at a glance: the combined pill How it works What to do if you miss a pill Who can use the combined pill Advantages and disadvantages Risks At a glance : the combined pill When taken correctly, the pill is over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. This means that fewer than one woman in 100 who use the combined pill as contraception will get pregnant in one year. Other methods, such as the IUD, implant and injection, are more effective. at preventing pregnancy. This means that fewer than one woman in 100 who use the combined pill as contraception will get pregnant in one year. Other methods, such as the IUD, implant and injection, are more effective. The usual way to take the pill is to take one every day for 21 days, then stop for seven days, and during this week you have a period-type bleed. You start taking the pill again after seven days. You need to take the pill at around the same time every day. You could get pregnant if you don't do this, or if you miss a pill, or vomit or have severe diarrhoea. Some medicines may make the pill less effective. Check with your doctor if you're taking any other tablets. If you have heavy periods or painful periods, PMS (premenstrual syndrome) or endometriosis the combined pill may help. Minor side effects include mood swings, nausea, breast tenderness and headaches. There is no evidence that the pill makes women gain weight. There's a very low risk of serious side effects, such as blood clots and cervical cancer. The combined pill is not suitable for women over 35 who smoke, or women with certain medical conditions.

One pill is taken each day for 21 days and then no pills are taken for the next seven days. Microgynon, Marvelon, Yasmine and Cilest are examples of this type of pill. Phasic 21-day pills Phasic pills contain two or three sections of different coloured pills in a pack. Each section contains a different amount of hormones. One pill is taken each day for 21 days and then no pills are taken for the next seven days. Phasic pills need to be taken in the right order. Logynon is an example of this type of pill. Every d ay (ED) pills There are 21 active pills and seven inactive (dummy) pills in a pack. The two types of pill look different. One pill is taken each day for 28 days with no break between packets of pills. Every day pills need to be taken in the right order. Microgynon ED is an example of this type of pill. Follow the instructions that come with your packet. If you have any questions, ask your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist. It's important to take the pills as instructed, because missing pills or taking them at the same time as certain medicines may make them less effective. How to take 21-day pills Take your first pill from the packet marked with the correct day of the week, or the first pill of the first colour (phasic pills). Continue to take a pill at the same time each day until the pack is finished. Stop taking pills for seven days (during these seven days you will get a bleed). Start your next pack of pills on the eighth day, whether you are still bleeding or not. This should be the same day of the week as when you took your first pill. How to take every day pills Take the first pill from the section of the packet marked \\"start\\". This will be an active pill. Continue to take a pill every day, in the correct order and preferably at the same time each day, until the pack is finished (28 days). During the seven days of taking the inactive pills, you will get a bleed. Start your next pack of pills after you have finished the first, whether you are still bleeding or not. Starting the combined pill Most women can start the pill at any time in their menstrual cycle. There is special guidance if you have just had a baby, abortion or miscarriage. You may need to use additional contraception during your first days on the pill – this depends on when in your menstrual cycle you start taking it. Starting on the first day of your period If you start the combined pill on the first day of your period (day one of your menstrual cycle) you will be protected from pregnancy straight away. You will not need additional contraception. Starting on the fifth day of your cycle or before If you start the pill on the fifth day of your period or before, you will still be protected from pregnancy straight away, unless you have a short menstrual cycle (your period is every 23 days or less). If you have a short menstrual cycle, you will need additional contraception, such as condoms, until you have taken the pill for seven days. Starting after the fifth day of your cycle You will not be protected from pregnancy straight away and will need additional contraception until you have taken the pill for seven days. If you start the pill after the fifth day of your cycle, make sure you have not put yourself at risk of pregnancy since your last period. If you're worried you're pregnant when you start the pill, take a pregnancy test three weeks after the last time you had unprotected sex. What to do if you miss a pill If you miss a pill or pills, or you start a pack late, this can make the pill less effective at preventing pregnancy. The chance of getting pregnant after missing a pill or pills depends on: when the pills are missed how many pills are missed Find out what to do if you miss a combined pill. Vomiting and diarrhoea If you vomit within two hours of taking the combined pill, it may not have been fully absorbed into your bloodstream. Take another pill straight away and the next pill at your usual time. If you continue to be sick, keep using another form of contraception until you've taken the pill again for seven days without vomiting. Very severe diarrhoea (six to eight watery stools in 24 hours) may also mean that the pill doesn't work properly. Keep taking your pill as normal, but use additional contraception, such as condoms, while you have diarrhoea and for two days after recovering. Speak to your GP or contraception nurse or call NHS 111 for more information, or if your sickness or diarrhoea continues. Who can use the combined pill If there are no medical reasons why you cannot take the pill, and you don't smoke, you can take the pill until your menopause. However, the pill is not suitable for all women. To find out whether the pill is right for you, talk to your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist. You should not take the pill if you: are pregnant smoke and are 35 or older stopped smoking less than a year ago and are 35 or older are very overweight take certain medicines (ask your GP or a health professional at a contraception clinic about this) You should also not take the pill if you have (or have had): thrombosis (a blood clot) in a vein, for example in your leg or lungs stroke or any other disease that narrows the arteries anyone in your close family having a blood clot under the age of 45 a heart abnormality or heart disease, including high blood pressure severe migraines, especially with aura (warning symptoms) breast cancer disease of the gallbladder or liver diabetes with complications or diabetes for the past 20 years After having a baby If you have just had a baby and are not breastfeeding, you can most likely start the pill on day 21 after the birth but you will need to check with your doctor. You will be protected against pregnancy straight away. If you start the pill later than 21 days after giving birth, you will need additional contraception (such as condoms) for the next seven days. If you are breastfeeding, you're not advised to take the combined pill until six weeks after the birth. After a miscarriage or abortion If you have had a miscarriage or abortion, you can start the pill up to five days after this and you will be protected from pregnancy straight away. If you start the pill more than five days after the miscarriage or abortion, you'll need to use additional contraception until you have taken the pill for seven days. Advantages and disadvantages Some advantages of the pill include: it does not interrupt sex it usually makes your bleeds regular, lighter and less painful it reduces your risk of cancer of the ovaries, womb and colon it can reduce symptoms of PMS (premenstrual syndrome) it can sometimes reduce acne it may protect against pelvic inflammatory disease it may reduce the risk of fibroids, ovarian cysts and non-cancerous breast disease Some disadvantages of the pill include: it can cause temporary side effects at first, such as headaches, nausea, breast tenderness and mood swings – if these do not go after a few months, it may help to change to a different pill it can increase your blood pressure it does not protect you against sexually transmitted infections breakthrough bleeding and spotting is common in the first few months of using the pill it has been linked to an increased risk of some serious health conditions, such as thrombosis (blood clots) and breast cancer The combined pill with other medicines Some medicines interact with the combined pill and it doesn't work properly. Some interactions are listed on this page, but it is not a complete list. If you want to check your medicines are safe to take with the combined pill, you can: ask your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine Antibiotics The antibiotics rifampicin and rifabutin (which can be used to treat illnesses including tuberculosis and meningitis) can reduce the effectiveness of the combined pill. Other antibiotics do not have this effect. If you are prescribed rifampicin or rifabutin, you may need additional contraception (such as condoms) while taking the antibiotic. Speak to your doctor or nurse for advice. Epilepsy and HIV medicines, and St John's wort The combined pill can interact with medicines called enzyme inducers. These speed up the breakdown of hormones by your liver, reducing the effectiveness of the pill. Examples of enzyme inducers are: the epilepsy drugs carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone and topiramate St John's wort (a herbal remedy) antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV (research suggests that interactions between these medicines and the progestogen-only pill can affect the safety and effectiveness of both) Your GP or nurse may advise you to use an alternative or additional form of contraception while taking any of these medicines. Risks of taking the combined pill There are some risks associated with using the combined contraceptive pill. However, these risks are small and, for most women, the benefits of the pill outweigh the risks. Blood clots The oestrogen in the pill may cause your blood to clot more readily. If a blood clot develops, it could cause: deep vein thrombosis (clot in your leg) pulmonary embolus (clot in your lung) stroke heart attack The risk of getting a blood clot is very small, but your doctor will check if you have certain risk factors that before prescribing the pill. The pill can be taken with caution if you have one of the risk factors below. It is unlikely you would be advised to take it if you have two or more risk factors. These include: being 35 years old or over being a smoker or having quit smoking in the past year being very overweight (in women with a BMI of 35 or over, the risks of using the pill usually outweigh the benefits) having migraines (you should not take the pill if you have severe or regular migraine attacks, especially if you get aura or a warning sign before an attack) having high blood pressure having had a blood clot or stroke in the past having a close relative who had a blood clot when they were younger than 45 being immobile for a long time – for example, in a wheelchair or with a leg in plaster Cancer Research is ongoing into the link between breast cancer and the pill. Research suggests that users of all types of hormonal contraception have a slightly higher chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer compared with women who do not use them. However, 10 years after you stop taking the pill, your risk of breast cancer goes back to normal. Research has also suggested a link between the pill and the risk of developing cervical cancer and a rare form of liver cancer. However, the pill does offer some protection against developing womb (endometrial) cancer, ovarian cancer and colon cancer. Where you can get the combined pill Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics sexual health clinics – they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some GP surgeries – talk to your GP or practice nurse some young people's services (call the Sexual Health Line on 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic. If you're under 16 years old Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you're under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won't tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you're given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They'll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won't make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you're at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first. ||||| Following our story of the tragic death of 21-year-old Fallan Kurek, who after taking the contraceptive pill, we have pulled together the latest information on the risks of taking the combined pill or progestogen-only pill below. This advice is taken from the NHS Choices website - which has more advice on contraception methods here Risks of taking the combined pill There are some risks associated with using the combined contraceptive pill. However, these risks are small and, for most women, the benefits of the pill outweigh the risks. Blood clots The oestrogen in the pill may cause your blood to clot more readily. If a blood clot develops, it could cause deep vein thrombosis (clot in your leg), pulmonary embolus (clot in your lung), stroke or heart attack . The risk of getting a blood clot is very small, but your doctor will check if you have certain risk factors that make you more vulnerable before prescribing the pill. The pill can be taken with caution if you have one of the risk factors below, but you should not take it if you have two or more risk factors. These include: being 35 years old or over being a smoker or having quit smoking in the past year being very overweight (in women with a BMI of 35 or over, the risks of using the pill usually outweigh the benefits) having migraines (you should not take the pill if you have severe or regular migraine attacks, especially if you get aura or a warning sign before an attack) having high blood pressure having had a blood clot or stroke in the past having a close relative who had a blood clot when they were younger than 45 being immobile for a long time – for example, in a wheelchair or with a leg in plaster Advantages and disadvantages Some advantages of the pill include: it does not interrupt sex it usually makes your bleeds regular, lighter and less painful it reduces your risk of cancer of the ovaries, womb and colon it can reduce symptoms of PMS it can sometimes reduce acne it may protect against pelvic inflammatory disease it may reduce the risk of fibroids, ovarian cysts and non-cancerous breast disease Some disadvantages of the pill include: it can cause temporary side effects at first, such as headaches, nausea, breast tenderness and mood swings – if these do not go after a few months, it may help to change to a different pill it can increase your blood pressure it does not protect you against sexually transmitted infections breakthrough bleeding and spotting is common in the first few months of using the pill it has been linked to an increased risk of some serious health conditions, such as thrombosis (blood clots) and breast cancer Risks of taking the progestogen-only pill The progestogen-only pill is very safe to take. However, as with the combined contraceptive pill, there are certain risks. These risks are small. For most women, benefits of the progestogen-only pill outweigh the risks. Ovarian cysts Some women can develop fluid-filled cysts on their ovaries. These are not dangerous and do not usually need to be removed. These cysts usually disappear without treatment. In many cases, the cysts do not cause symptoms, although some women experience pelvic pain. Breast cancer Research is continuing into the link between breast cancer and the progestogen-only pill. Research suggests that women who use any type of hormonal contraception have a slightly higher chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer compared with people who don’t use hormonal contraception. However, 10 years after you stop taking the pill, your risk of breast cancer goes back to normal. If you have a family history of breast cancer, you may feel that this increase in risk (however small it is) is not worth taking. However, doctors do not think that using the contraceptive pill is likely to increase the risk in women who already have close relatives with breast cancer. Advantages and disadvantages Some advantages of the progestogen-only pill include: it does not interrupt sex you can use it when breastfeeding it is useful if you cannot take the hormone oestrogen, which is in the combined pill, contraceptive patch and vaginal ring you can use it at any age – even if you smoke and are over 35 it can reduce the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and painful periods Some disadvantages of the progestogen-only pill include: you may not have regular periods while taking it – your periods may be lighter, more frequent or may stop altogether, and you may get spotting between periods it does not protect you against STIs you need to remember to take it at or around the same time every day some medications, including certain types of antibiotic, can make it less effective The progestogen-only pill is generally well tolerated and side effects are rare. Some side effects can include: acne breast tenderness and breast enlargement an increased or decreased sex drive mood changes headache and migraine nausea or vomiting cysts (small fluid-filled sacs) on your ovaries (these are usually harmless and disappear without treatment) stomach upset weight gain Have you experienced health problems using the contraceptive pill?

Paramedics rushed to her house in Tamworth after the 21-year-old teaching assistant vomited and minutes later she turned blue after she stopped breathing. Fallan was taken to Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield with parents Brian and Julia by her side, but after three days in intensive care she was pronounced brain dead. She passed away just hours later on Thursday May 14, surrounded by her loved-ones. Her cause of death was recorded as pulmonary embolism on her lung – and her devastated parents say doctors said it was caused by the contraceptive pill she had been taking for just 25 days. “We felt angry when they first mentioned it could be the pill,” said devastated Julia, who is also mum to Michael, 24, Robert, 22 and Jessica 19. “She was only on it to regulate her periods. I couldn’t believe nobody had said the pill could do this. It should say it on the pack that they can kill and the label.” Fallan, who worked as a teaching assistant with children with learning disabilities, was prescribed Rigevidon by her GP to regulate her periods. Julia said her daughter was told to take the combined pill for three months before having a break. Breathlessness But after three weeks of taking the contraceptive, she began suffering with breathlessness and pains in her legs and ribs. While out with her parents at a local salon she suffered what they thought was a panic attack. Worried Brian took her to the local Sir John Peel Hospital for a check-up where she was given an electrocardiogram (ECG). “They said everything was fine, they said she had probably bruised her sternum,” recalled Julia. “They said to go home and take some Ibuprofen and paracetemol. If symptoms continue then go see your GP. “We thought nothing more of it, she still said she had this little niggling pain, but it wasn’t bothering her too much.” Four days later Julia and Brian went to wake up Fallan to see if she was feeling any better. “She said she felt fine, but when she sat up in bed she started getting breathless again,” said Brian, 52. “She took her pill, then she got up, and then began walking downstairs. “But as she got half way down the stairs she collapsed. I got to the bottom of the stairs and she just went limp in my arms.’’ Paramedics arrived and began carrying out tests on the still conscious Fallan, but within minutes they switched to emergency CPR when she stopped breathing. She was rushed to Good Hope Hospital’s intensive care unit, where she was put on a ventilator and emergency scans on her head and chest took place. But Julia said medics then asked her whether her daughter was taking the pill. “While they were working on her someone came in to talk to me,” said the mum. “They asked me whether there was any heart problems in the family, or if Fallan had taken drugs - definitely not. “The third question was, ‘Is she on the pill?’ I said, ‘Yes, is that relevant?’ He said, ‘We know what it is’ and off he went. “Brian and I just looked at each other - we couldn’t believe it.” A scan revealed that Fallan had a large clot on her lung, causing the right side of her heart to become inflamed. She spent the next three days in ICU at Good Hope, while her parents waited anxiously by her bedside. Emergency “On Wednesday night we were told her blood pressure and heart rate had gone sky high, and she needed an emergency CT scan,” said Julia. “I just had a horrible feeling. We knew that something bad had happened.” Sadly, the CT scan revealed that Fallan was clinically brain dead after being starved of oxygen before arriving at hospital. Her ventilator was switched off on Thursday May 14, and she died half an hour later at 5.10pm. “Fallen was looking forward to the rest of her life,” said heartbroken Brian. “She was confident, cheeky, bubbly, and the mother hen to all her friends. “We just don’t want any other family to go through this.” Inquest An inquest into her death will be conducted by the South Staffordshire coroner in due course. Her parents have also been given a temporary death certificate, so they can finally give their daughter a funeral on May 29. The family is asking that anyone wishing to make a tribute to Fallan to donate to the ICU unit at Good Hope Hospital. Julia hopes sharing Fallan’s story will raise awareness about potentially fatal symptoms of blood clots and taking the pill. “This is all because of 25 days,” she said. Her parents also hope medical professionals will take more time to explain serious side effects to all women, not just those in high risk groups, such as smokers or overweight women. “They know the pill can cause blood clots,” said Brian. “We can’t bring her back, all we can do is maybe save another life.” Regulation The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the government body which regulates the drug, insists the pill is safe and that women should continue to take it. A spokesman said: “Women should continue to take their contraceptive pill. These are very safe, highly effective medicines for preventing unintended pregnancy and the benefits associated with their use far outweigh their risks. “The safety of contraceptive pills was reviewed at European level in 2014 and the review confirmed that the risk of blood clots with all contraceptives is small. The benefits of any combined hormonal contraceptive far outweigh the risk of serious side effects – prescribers and women should be aware of the major risk factors for blood clots and the key signs and symptoms. “If women have questions, they should discuss them with their GP or contraceptive provider at their next routine appointment but should keep taking their contraceptive until they have done so.” Gedeon Ritcher, the Hungarian company that manufacturer Rigevidon, did not respond when approached by the Birmingham Mail.

The woman suffered a fatal blood clot after being prescribed the contraceptive pill. Fallan Kurek, who worked as a teaching assistant with children with learning disabilities, was given Rigevidon by her GP to regulate her periods. Dr Tom Black from the British Medical Association said that while it is important to take professional advice before taking the pill, it is safe for most people as there have been millions of prescriptions and the formulations have a lower hormone dose than in previous years. According to the NHS, there is a very low risk of serious side effects from taking the contraceptive pill, however, it is important to consult with a doctor before starting any new medication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Not only are they heavily agricultural , but they are some of the most religious areas in Canada .","completion":"While these two sentences may seem similar, they are not identical and convey slightly different meanings. To better understand the differences between them, let's break down each sentence and consider its elements: Sentence 1: \\"They are not only hard to religious, but they are some of the most agricultural areas in Canada.\\" In this sentence, \\"hard to religious\\" is an unconventional phrase which seems to be missing a verb or noun. It is unclear what the author intended to convey here. Perhaps the intended meaning was that the areas are difficult to relate to in terms of religion, or that the religious aspect of these areas is hard to define or understand. On the other hand, the second part of this sentence clearly states that these areas are \\"some of the most agricultural areas in Canada.\\" This phrase tells us that the primary characteristic of these areas is their strong association with agriculture. Sentence 2: \\"Not only are they heavily agricultural, but they are some of the most religious areas in Canada.\\" This sentence has more clarity than the first one. Here, the areas are described as \\"heavily agricultural,\\" meaning that agriculture plays a significant role in their economy or landscape. The second part of the sentence, \\"they are some of the most religious areas in Canada,\\" indicates that religion is also a major characteristic of these regions. In comparison, the first sentence seems to suggest that these areas are difficult to understand in terms of religion while being agriculturally significant in Canada. The second sentence emphasizes that these areas are both heavily agricultural and religious. In summary, while both sentences may be referring to the same areas in Canada, they differ in their emphasis and clarity. The first sentence is not entirely clear in its description of the areas' religious aspects, and the second sentence places equal weight on the agricultural and religious characteristics of the areas.

Food and water dishes should be cleaned out every day using hot water and dish soap. Rinse the dishes before lathering with soap, then rinse the soap off under hot water for several seconds.","completion":"Clean the perches and toys. Birds spend most of their time perching and playing with toys in their cage. To keep the cage clean and safe for your pet, it is essential to clean the perches and toys regularly. Here's how to clean them effectively: 1. Remove all perches, toys, and accessories from the cage, making sure to take note of their original positions so you can put them back in their correct places later. 2. Use a brush or an old toothbrush to scrub off any visible debris or droppings from the perches and toys. This will make the cleaning process much easier and ensure that your bird's belongings are thoroughly cleaned. 3. Prepare a solution of warm water and mild dish soap. Make sure that the soap you use is free of any harsh chemicals, as these can be harmful to your bird. The water should be hot enough to dissolve the dirt and grime but not so hot that it's scalding to your touch. 4. Soak the perches, toys, and accessories in the soapy water for about 15 minutes. This will help to loosen any stubborn debris and make scrubbing them easier. 5. After soaking, scrub the items again using a brush or old toothbrush. Be thorough, paying close attention to any nooks, crannies, and hard-to-reach areas. 6. Rinse the perches and toys under hot water, making sure to remove all traces of soap. Any soap residue left behind can cause irritation to your bird's skin and respiratory system. 7. Allow the items to air dry completely before returning them to the cage. Make sure they are free of any moisture, as damp conditions can lead to the growth of mold and bacteria. Clean the cage itself. Once you've cleaned the accessories, it's time to clean the cage itself. Follow these steps to ensure your bird's living environment remains clean, hygienic, and comfortable: 1. Remove your bird safely from the cage and place it in a secure temporary location where it won't be exposed to any potential hazards or stressors. 2. Pre-clean the cage with a brush or vacuum to remove any loose seed hulls, feathers, and other debris. 3. Prepare a solution of warm water and mild dish soap. Again, be sure to use a soap that is free of harsh chemicals. 4. Using a sponge or cloth, scrub the surfaces, bars, and corners of the cage, paying particular attention to any stubborn or hard-to-reach areas. Be thorough in your cleaning, as bacteria can build-up in these places and pose a risk to your bird's health. 5. Once you've cleaned the cage entirely, rinse it well with warm water, ensuring that you remove all soap residue. 6. To disinfect the cage, prepare a solution of water and white vinegar or water and hydrogen peroxide, mixed at a 50:50 ratio. Wipe down the cage with this solution, then rinse the cage again with hot water. 7. Let the cage air dry completely before reassembling the perches, toys, and accessories. Ensure the cage is completely dry to prevent the growth of mold and bacteria. 8. Once everything is clean and dry, return your bird to its freshly cleaned cage. Be sure to watch your bird closely for the first few hours after cleaning to ensure it isn't experiencing any discomfort from its clean environment. Maintaining a clean and healthy environment for your bird is essential in ensuring their overall health and well-being. By following this cleaning routine, you'll be providing your bird with a comfortable and safe environment in which it can thrive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As he continues driving he gets closer and closer to the mountains. At which point will the mountains look bigger? (A) when they're off in the distance (B) when they're up close Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"mountains up close\\" and \\"mountains off in the distance\\". The answer is:","completion":"mountains up close. When Mike initially sees the mountains off in the distance, they appear smaller due to the effect of perspective. Perspective is a phenomenon that affects the way we perceive objects as they recede into the distance. As objects, like mountains, get further away, they appear progressively smaller to the viewer. This is because the angle at which light from the distant object reaches our eyes decreases as the distance between the viewer and the object increases. As Mike continues driving and gets closer to the mountains, the angle at which light from the mountains reaches his eyes increases. As a result, the image of the mountains on his retina becomes larger, and the mountains appear progressively larger to him. This is due to the fact that the distance between Mike and the mountains decreases, resulting in an increased angle of light reaching his eyes. Furthermore, another factor that contributes to the perception of the mountains appearing larger as Mike gets closer is the relative size of the mountains compared to other objects in the environment. When the mountains are off in the distance, they are surrounded by other visual cues, such as trees, buildings, and other landscape features. These cues help our visual system establish a sense of scale, making the mountains seem smaller in comparison. As Mike gets closer to the mountains, these other visual cues become less prominent or disappear altogether, removing any sense of scale. This can cause the mountains to appear even larger than they would if they were viewed in isolation. In conclusion, the mountains will look bigger to Mike when he is up close. This phenomenon occurs due to the effects of perspective and the relative size of the mountains compared to other visual cues in the environment, which change as Mike approaches the mountains."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Gatorade replaces electrolytes and the boy misheard that information and asked what he thought it meant .. Explanation: In the context provided, the boy, Geoffrey, presumably misunderstood the purpose of Gatorade. Gatorade is famously known for replenishing electrolytes in the body, which is probably the information the boy misunderstood or misheard and hence inquired if it is for light replacement. Here's why other options are wrong: B). None of the above choices .. - Disregarded, as at least one choice is correct and applicable. C). Because the lights burnt out in his room and he thought the Gatorade would help replace them .. - There's no mention or hint in the text about any lights burning out in his room which makes this choice easily dismissible. D). Because he thought the Gatorade would make it light outside so he could ride his bike again .. - This option is highly improbable.

Select the topic that this about: Three second-half goals keep Arsenal's unbeaten record alive in a controversial encounter.","completion":"Three second-half goals keep Arsenal's unbeaten record alive in a controversial encounter Summary: In a match filled with contentious decisions and high emotions, Arsenal managed to maintain their unbeaten record in dramatic fashion. With a comeback spurred on by three outstanding second-half goals, Arsenal overcame a difficult challenge from their tenacious opponents. As the match progressed, there were some dubious officiating decisions, igniting the fury of players on both sides of the field. The game will be remembered not only for its grit, determination, and tactical masterclass but also for the controversy that will continue to spark debates among football fans. Prelude: As the two teams prepared for battle, Arsenal knew that they had an impressive unbeaten record to uphold. Their opponents, aware of the task at hand, were determined to bring about Arsenal’s first loss of the season. Both sides exhibited confidence, but there was an underlying tension as the match commenced, knowing that the stakes were high. First Half: The first half could be best described as cagey, with both teams focusing on not conceding a goal. Defenses seemed to be on top, but there were a few half-chances as the game began to open up. Arsenal's opponents were growing in confidence and appeared to be gaining momentum. The first controversial moment occurred when Arsenal felt they had a legitimate claim for a penalty. However, the referee waved play on, sparking the first signs of animosity on the field. Towards the end of the first half, Arsenal's opponents capitalized on a momentary lapse in concentration in Arsenal’s backline. They scored what seemed to be a crucial goal, leading 1-0 going into halftime. This gave them a potentially decisive advantage, but the match was far from over. Second Half: Setting aside frustration from the contentious first half, Arsenal approached the second half with renewed focus and determination. A pivotal moment occurred when Arsenal were awarded a free-kick in a dangerous position. Their star player stepped up and unleashed an unstoppable curling shot, nestling it into the top corner, sparking wild celebrations among the Arsenal faithful and tying the game at 1-1. This goal instilled confidence into Arsenal’s play, and they began to dominate possession. Still, they had to be wary of their opponents, who were still posing a threat on the counter-attack. As the game approached the final 20 minutes, another controversial moment arose, with Arsenal's opponents feeling aggrieved after a strong penalty appeal was dismissed by the referee. This decision led to heated exchanges between players from both teams and further intensified an already emotionally charged game. Undeterred by distractions, Arsenal's persistence eventually paid off as they took the lead through a well-taken strike from their influential midfielder, who drilled a low shot past the outstretched goalkeeper, making the score 2-1. In the dying minutes, Arsenal's opponents threw everything forward in search of an equalizer, but it was Arsenal who had the last laugh, scoring a decisive third goal on the break. The dynamic winger showed exceptional pace to outpace the defense before calmly sliding the ball into the net, sealing Arsenal's victory at 3-1. Conclusion: After a hard-fought win, Arsenal's unbeaten record remained intact, but the game would be remembered for the controversial decisions that caused high emotions on and off the pitch. Debates will continue as fans critique the match, but ultimately, the character and determination of Arsenal shone through as they emerged victoriously despite the odds stacked against them. This comeback will go down in history as one of Arsenal's most memorable encounters, and the team will look to build upon this momentum for the remainder of the season."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

In this sentence, the punctuation has been fixed by adding a comma after the word \\"Fjord,\\" which makes the sentence easier to read and improves its flow. Before the correction, the sentence seemed to be running together, causing confusion for readers. This additional comma allows a slight pause between the two related but not dependent clauses in the sentence. The first clause describes the beauty of the Tasiusaq Fjord: \\"It was wonderful to see the shining waters of Tasiusaq Fjord.\\" The second clause discusses the necessity of carrying gear over land: \\"even though it had been necessary for us to carry our gear over land to get there.\\" Proper punctuation is essential in written communication because it provides cues to the reader on how to interpret the sentence structure. Punctuation marks like commas help separate phrases and ideas, ensuring that the sentence's intended meaning is clear and easy to understand. Without appropriate punctuation, the meaning of a sentence might become unclear or ambiguous. It could also make the text harder to comprehend, forcing readers to re-read sentences to figure out the intended message. In this particular sentence, the addition of a comma after \\"Fjord\\" ensures that the message is conveyed more efficiently, as it separates the two clauses - one describing the beauty of the Fjord and the other explaining the effort to reach it. This separation enhances the readability of the sentence, making it easier for readers to understand the experiences and emotions of the person who has visited the Tasiusaq Fjord.

Here is a question about this article: Under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin, the Bolsheviks established the Soviet state on 7 November [O.S. 25 October] 1917, immediately after the Russian Provisional Government, which governed the Russian Republic, was overthrown during the October Revolution. Initially, the state did not have an official name and wasn't recognized by neighboring countries for five months.

Create two counters, one for numbers and one for alphabets. Set both counters to zero initially. 3. Go through each element in the input list A and check if it is a number or an alphabet. For this example, you can use the Python function \`isalpha()\` to check for alphabets, and \`isnumeric()\` to check for numbers. 4. If an element is a number, increment the numbers counter. If an element is an alphabet, increment the alphabets counter. Repeat this for all the elements of list A. 5. After going through all the elements, compare the counters of numbers and alphabets. 6. If the count of numbers is more than alphabets, output 'Numbers Win'. If the count of alphabets is more than numbers, output 'Alphabets Win'. If the count of numbers and alphabets is the same, output 'Numbers and Alphabets are Tied'. For the input list A = ['v', '8571', '1863', 'Z', '4263', 'e', '4701', 'u', '5673', 'y'], you would find that there are 5 numbers (8571, 1863, 4263, 4701, 5673) and 5 alphabets (v, Z, e, u, y).

The Cleja River is a tributary of the Iminog River in Romania . 2. The River Iminog is a tributary of the River Cleja in Romania . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, these two sentences are not paraphrases of each other. Although they both mention rivers, Iminog and Cleja, in Romania, they present distinctly different pieces of information about the tributary relationships between the two rivers. 1. In the first sentence, it states that the Cleja River is a tributary of the Iminog River in Romania. This means that the Cleja River flows into and joins the Iminog River. In terms of hierarchy, the Cleja River is a smaller or subsidiary river that merges into the larger main river, which in this case is the Iminog River. 2. In contrast, the second sentence states that the River Iminog is a tributary of the River Cleja in Romania. This sentence conveys a completely different relationship between the rivers. In this case, it is implying that the Iminog River is a tributary that flows into the Cleja River, meaning that the Iminog River is the smaller or subsidiary river, while the Cleja River is the main river. In summary, the two sentences are not paraphrases of each other because they communicate different tributary relationships between the Cleja River and the Iminog River in Romania. The first sentence establishes the Cleja River as a tributary of the Iminog River, while the second sentence presents the Iminog River as a tributary of the Cleja River."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The paragraph provided only states that Damontre Moore was drafted in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft, but it does not specify the exact pick number. Each NFL Draft round consists of 32 selections (picks), with each of the league's 32 teams having one selection per round unless trades or other maneuvers affect the original order. To better understand why we cannot confirm the statement's accuracy, let's dive deeper into the 2013 NFL Draft and Damontre Moore's draft position. In the 2013 NFL Draft, Damontre Moore was selected in the third round by the New York Giants. Given that there are 32 teams in the NFL, the first two rounds of the draft would already encompass 64 selections (32 for each round). When we look at the third round of the draft, Damontre Moore was picked as the 81st overall selection. In other words, he was the 17th pick of the third round, not the 10th. Therefore, based on the information given and the additional context about the 2013 NFL Draft, we cannot conclude that the statement \\"Damontre Moore was the 10th pick in the 2013 NFL Draft\\" is true. Instead, Damontre Moore was the 17th pick in the third round and the 81st overall selection in the 2013 NFL Draft."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: A new plan for getting children to and from school is being started by the education authorities in part of Eastern England. This could end the worries of many parents fearful for their children's safety on the roads. Until now the Country Council has only been prepared to provide bus services for children living more than three miles from their school, or sometimes less if special reasons existed. Now it has been decided that if a group of parents ask for help in organizing transport they will be prepared to go ahead, provided the arrangement will not lose money and that children taking part will be attending their nearest school. The new scheme is to be tried out this term for children living at Milton who attend Impington school. The children live just within the three-mile limit and the Council has said in the past it will not undertake to provide free transport to the school. But now they have agreed to organize a bus service from Milton to Impington and back, a plan which has the support of the school's headmaster. Between 50 and 60 parents have said they would like their children to take part. Final calculations have still to be carried out, but a council official has said the cost to parents should be less than PS6. 50 a term. They have been able to arrange the service at a low cost because there is already an agreement with the bus company for a bus to take children who live further away to Impington. The same bus would now just make an extra journey to pick up the Milton children. The official said they would get in touch with other groups of parents who in the past had asked if transport could be provided for their children, to see if they would like to take part in the new scheme.

The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

I have used the preposition \\"a\\" to indicate the receiver, and kept the name \\"Sicilia\\" for the region.

Look for it? Sure...but don't spend a lifetime trying, especially if it's well within your reach but you're just too blind to see it. Discover the three keys to happiness that you have already understood, but that you are just too afraid to find it. 1. Accepting Yourself The idea of happiness is difficult to understand if you are not at peace with yourself. Learn to accept yourself as you are. Your next step will be to improve your attitude for tomorrow, for the next day, for the day after that, and so forth. By beginning to accept reality, you will come to the final point of true happiness. Only when you are at peace with yourself, will you finally be able to admit that you are, in fact, a happy person. 2. Forgiving Others Forgiving others is a true show of humanity which also allows us to feel more at ease. When you learn to forgive, you also learn to keep a firm hold on your life. To forgive is to open the doors of personal satisfaction. Yet you simply open your mind to answer, \\" Do I really want to allow my anger to grow and eat me from inside out?\\" 3. Helping Your Neighbors When a friend seems to be suffering from a state of depression , it's quite easy to help him or her out of the trouble. The best attitude to have in this situation is to make him or her understand that he or she is not alone. If you come to save a friend in need, you'll feel a lot more at peace with yourself. You will feel high--spirited by knowing that someone is looking at life on the brighter side thanks to your kind words. ,.

More than 3,500 species of native bees pollinate crops.

If I tell you that Chordates can experience shock, and ask you the question \\"what can chordates go through?\\", is the correct answer \\"disease\\"? Answer:","completion":"If you ask the question \\"what can chordates go through?\\" and provide the information that chordates can experience shock, the correct answer should not be limited to \\"disease.\\" While disease can be one of the many things that chordates can go through, it does not encompass the full range of experiences that chordates can encounter, including the mention of shock. Chordates are a large and diverse group of animals that share certain characteristics, such as a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail at some point in their development. Examples of chordates include mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. To provide a more comprehensive answer to the question \\"what can chordates go through?\\", we can list several aspects that chordates may experience: 1. Shock: As mentioned, chordates can experience shock. Shock can be a result of various causes, such as trauma, severe infection, or significant blood loss, which leads to a systemic failure to provide adequate oxygen and nutrients to vital organs. 2. Disease: Chordates can indeed go through a wide variety of diseases caused by various factors, such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, or genetic mutations. Examples include common colds, cancer, parasitic infections, and countless others. As disease can impact the health and well-being of chordates, it plays a significant role in their experience. 3. Predation and competition: Chordates, like all living organisms, are involved in the struggle for existence. They may experience predation or competition for resources such as food, shelter, and mates. 4. Growth and development: Chordates undergo a multitude of developmental changes throughout their lives as they grow from embryos to adults. This process can involve metamorphosis, such as the transformation of a tadpole into a frog, or the gradual modifications that lead to an adult mammal. 5. Reproduction: Chordates must reproduce to maintain the continuity of their species. They can utilize various reproductive strategies, which can include sexual or asexual reproduction, oviparity (laying eggs), ovoviviparity (live birth with eggs retained within the mother's body), or viviparity (giving birth to live young without the development of an egg). 6. Environmental interactions: Chordates interact with their environments and must adapt to various ecological pressures. They can experience habitat changes, including variations in temperature, light, or water availability. Climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction are factors that can significantly affect the lives of chordates, sometimes leading to population declines or even extinction. 7. Social interactions: Many chordates have complex social lives, involving individual and group behaviors, such as bonding, communication, cooperation, territoriality, and conflict resolution. In summary, while disease is one of the various experiences that chordates can go through, it is essential to consider the whole picture. Chordates can go through a wide range of experiences, including shock, disease, predation, growth and development, reproduction, environmental interactions, and social interactions. These experiences, both positive and negative, are part of the complex lives and survival strategies that chordates employ."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article: To prevent diabetes you will get a real jolt ( shock ) when you follow the prescription offered up in the \\"Journal of the American Medical Association.\\" This 'prestigious' organization reported on separate studies of coffee drinkers in Sweden and Finland. Whiz-bang medical researchers discovered that women could decrease their risk of diabetes by 29 percent when they followed a regimen of drinking three to four cups of coffee a day. The ladies who had the courage to drink 10 or more cups of coffee a day progressed even better. They reduced their risk of diabetes by 79 percent. The men participating in the studies also reduced their risk, but not to the extent as did the women. When men drank three to four cups a day, they reduced their risk of diabetes by 27 percent. The men who drank 10 or more cups of java per day reduced their risk by 55 percent. These results confirm a January report by the equally 'prestigious' Harvard School of Public Health. That report concluded that drinking six 8-ounce cups of coffee a day could reduce diabetes risk in men by about 50 percent and in women by 30 percent. If the numbers have any connection to reality, the more coffee you drink, the better off you are. And that is the rub. The numbers have nothing to do with reality, nothing to do with the truth. Here in America the rate of adult-onset diabetes, or Type 2 diabetes, is growing increasingly. Nowadays it typically shows up in middle-age populations, but the disease is on the rise among ever-younger age groups. Do not step up your coffee consumption in the belief it will help you prevent diabetes. This disease has ly nothing to do with a lack of coffee drinking. Science and truth are not synonymous. Medical scientists do not deal with truth. The medical scientists who monkey around with coffee drinking merely play with limited and approximate descriptions of reality. In this case, extremely limited and hardly approximate. If you are serious about preventing diabetes, you have to look at the differences between the people...

The recall covers Jeep Cherokees from the 2014 and 2015 model years. Fiat Chrysler, which makes Jeeps, says there have been a small number of inadvertent air bag deployments. The 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee (pictured) has been recalled due to faulty side air bags. Canadian safety regulators say the problem occurred mainly in off-road situations. Sudden air bag inflation can startle drivers and cause crashes, but Chrysler says it's not aware of any accidents or injuries. Most of the recalled vehicles are in the U.S. and Canada. Dealers will recalibrate the software to change the threshold for inflating the air bags. The problem is the latest in a string of auto industry troubles with air bags. The 2014 model of Jeep Cherokee is priced from 20,000 and over a million Jeeps were sold worldwide last year - a 39% increase from 2013. Jeep are reacting to worldwide demand by planning more availability of the brand in China and Brazil.

Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

I read this background article the other day: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. I am facing a new situation today: Mike was interested in the science behind polar compounds. To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which compound would have lower melting point, compound A or compound B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Compound B, the nonpolar compound, would have a lower melting point. This is because polar compounds, like compound A, have relatively high melting and boiling points due to the presence of hydrogen bonds. Although these bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another. Therefore, it takes higher temperatures for changes of state to occur in polar compounds. In contrast, nonpolar compounds, like compound B, do not have these additional hydrogen bonds, so it takes less energy for their molecules to move apart, resulting in lower melting and boiling points."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"why do animals sweat?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"if an animal sweats then that animal 's bodily water decreases\\" and \\"just like sweating, the evaporation of the water cools the body\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"why do animals sweat?\\" would be: Animals sweat in order to regulate their body temperature through the process of evaporation, which cools the body and helps maintain an optimal internal environment. When an animal sweats, its body releases water through sweat glands located in the skin. This water then evaporates on the surface of the skin. The evaporation process requires heat energy, which is absorbed from the animal's body, thereby helping to cool it down. The hint from the teacher that \\"if an animal sweats then that animal's bodily water decreases\\" refers to the fact that, when an animal sweats, it loses water from its body. This loss of water is typically replenished through the consumption of liquids, such as water or other fluids. The importance of staying hydrated cannot be understated, especially for animals that rely heavily on sweating as a means for temperature regulation, as dehydration can have adverse effects on health and performance. The second hint provided, that \\"just like sweating, the evaporation of the water cools the body\\", emphasizes that the mechanism by which sweating helps maintain an appropriate body temperature is related to the process of evaporation. As the water released by sweat glands evaporates, it effectively removes heat from the body, allowing the animal to maintain a stable internal temperature. In conclusion, the best answer to the question \\"why do animals sweat?\\" is that animals sweat to regulate their body temperature by utilizing the cooling effects provided by the evaporation of water from their skin. This physiological process is important for their overall health, as maintaining an optimal internal environment is essential to their well-being and survival."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Q: What does the presence of gill slits suggest about humans and fish? Choices: - Shared History - Common Cells - Same evolutionary chain - common ancestor A: Answer:","completion":"The presence of gill slits in both humans and fish suggests a shared evolutionary history and a common ancestor. This similarity in anatomical structure reflects the idea that both humans and fish have descended from a common ancestor that possessed these features at some point in the distant past. To better understand this concept, it is important to first understand what gill slits are. In aquatic animals, such as fish, gill slits are openings that lead to the gills, which play a crucial role in respiration. Gills extract dissolved oxygen from the surrounding water, allowing fish to breathe and survive in their underwater environment. Humans, on the other hand, possess pharyngeal slits during embryonic development, which later develop into various structures of the head and neck. The presence of gill slits during the embryonic stage in humans is a fascinating example of a shared feature with fish. This similarity is the result of a common ancestor that both humans and fish shared millions of years ago. Over time, through the process of evolution, species have diverged and adapted to different environments and ways of life. However, some vestiges of ancestral traits can still be seen in various species, including humans. In evolutionary biology, such homologous structures are evidence for a shared evolutionary history. The presence of gill slits in both humans and fish demonstrates that the two groups share a common ancestor that possessed this feature. This ancestor would have branched off into different evolutionary lineages, leading to the variety of species we see today. While gill slits may seem like a surprising link between humans and fish, this is just one of many examples of shared features throughout the animal kingdom. By studying these evolutionary connections and similarities, scientists can better understand the relationships between different species and how they have adapted and changed over time. In conclusion, the presence of gill slits in both humans and fish points to a shared evolutionary history and a common ancestor, rather than representing a mere coincidence or the same evolutionary chain. This ancestral connection highlights the interconnectedness of all life on Earth, reminding us of our own biological roots in the rich tapestry of life."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Input: Passage: There are over 20 miles (32 km) of hiking trails at Worlds End State Park. Most of the trails are rocky and steep, so hikers are encouraged to wear proper footgear and to be prepared for icy conditions during the cold winter months. As John Young writes in Hike Pennsylvania, \\"If you want to do some hiking in the Worlds End region, you should know that hiking here means climbing\\". Worlds End State Park is open during the winter months for snow mobiling and cross-country skiing. Most of the trails are too steep or rugged for either activity, but the park roads are open, as are trails on surrounding state forest lands. Loyalsock Trail, often abbreviated LT, is a rugged 59.28-mile (95.40 km) hiking trail that stretches from near Loyalsockville, in Lycoming County on Pennsylvania Route 87 to north of Laporte in Sullivan County, just off U.S. Route 220. This trail follows the ridges and streams of the Loyalsock Creek watershed. The trail is primarily within the boundaries of Loyalsock State Forest and uses some old logging roads and abandoned railroad grades. The Loyalsock Trail was originally blazed in a yellow rectangle with a red stripe, and red can lids with a yellow \\"LT\\". Recently, the trail markers have been changed to a yellow disc with a red \\"LT\\". Link Trail is a moderate 8.5-mile (13.7 km) trail marked with a red X on a yellow circle blaze. The trail starts at the Cabin Bridge in the park and follows Loyalsock Creek before it branches off and follows Double Run. The trail then ascends to Canyon Vista and heads out into Loyalsock State Forest where it links up with the Loyalsock Trail at the 55.33-mile (89.05 km) post. The Loyalsock Trail can be followed back for a 17.62 miles (28.36 km) long loop. Canyon Vista Trail is a 3.5-mile (5.6 km) loop trail with blue blazes that passes through the eastern portion of the park and a stand of ash, sugar maple, and black cherry trees. This trail passes a maze-like jumble of blocky Pottsville Formation rocks known as the Rock Garden, adjacent to Canyon Vista. The vista is at an elevation of 1,750 feet (530 m) and \\"rewards the hiker with a spectacular view of the Loyalsock Creek gorge\\". Worlds End Trail is a 3.25-mile (5.23 km) trail with yellow blazes that begins at the park office and ascends to an overlook of the swimming area. It then crosses the old Pioneer Road, which was used by some of the first settlers to the area, and enters the Loyalsock State Forest, ending at the 37.77-mile (60.78 km) post of the Loyalsock Trail, which can be followed back to the park office to make a loop 11.5 miles (18.5 km) long. Butternut Trail is a 2.5-mile (4.0 km) trail marked with orange blazes that loops through a hardwood forest and crosses over Butternut Run. Two side trails connect Butternut Trail with the Loyalsock Trail. Question: What is the name of the trail that ends at the 37.77-mile mark of the Loyalsock trail?

Since tantalum metal has a lower resistivity than carbon, the tantalum lamp filament was quite long and required multiple internal supports. The metal filament had the property of gradually shortening in use; the filaments were installed with large loops that tightened in use. This made lamps in use for several hundred hours quite fragile. Metal filaments had the property of breaking and re-welding, though this would usually decrease resistance and shorten the life of the filament. General Electric bought the rights to use tantalum filaments and produced them in the US until 1913.","completion":"\\"Siemens' Tantalum Filament Development in 1902: The Evolution of Enhanced Light Bulb Efficiency and Its Legacy\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The dog accompanied him, frisking about him in friendly fashion. Rolfe first examined the bedroom that he had seen Inspector Chippenfield enter. It was a small room, containing a double bed. It was prettily furnished in white, with white curtains, and toilet-table articles in ivory to match. A glance round the room convinced Rolfe that it was impossible for a man to secrete himself in it. The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor. There was no other hiding-place possible, except beneath the bed, and the ruthless hand of the inspector had torn off the white muslin bed hangings, revealing emptiness underneath. Rolfe went out into the hall again, and entered the room next the bedroom. This apartment was apparently used as a dining-room, for it contained a large table, a few chairs, a small sideboard, a spirit-stand, a case of books and ornaments, and two small oak presses. Plainly, there was no place in it where a man could hide himself. The next room was the bathroom, which was also empty. Opposite the bathroom was a small bedroom, very barely furnished, offering no possibility of concealment. Then the passage opened into a large roomy kitchen, the full width of the rooms on both sides of the hall, and the kitchen completed the flat.

I have known, and admired, Julia Busuttil Nishimura, for many years now and always felt connected through our love of Italian food, Tuscany (Julia lived in Florence and in Orbetello, just 10 minutes away from where we lived in Porto Ercole while I was writing Acquacotta) and Japan. So I have been eagerly awaiting her debut cookbook, Ostro: The Pleasure that Comes From Slowing Down and Cooking with Simple Ingredients, and it is a beauty — it is full of food I want to make and eat. It’s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque. I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu — homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy). Yes, these are all things you can also buy in a packet, but Julia’s point is, it is a pleasure to make these things by hand, and the ingredients are so simple — water, flour, cream, eggs, — you probably have them all in your house already.

Context: In the Atlantic, the West India Company concentrated on wresting from Portugal its grip on the sugar and slave trade, and on opportunistic attacks on the Spanish treasure fleets on their homeward bound voyage. Bahia on the north east coast of Brazil was captured in 1624 but only held for a year before it was recaptured by a joint Spanish-Portuguese expedition. In 1628, Piet Heyn captured the entire Spanish treasure fleet, and made off with a vast fortune in precious metals and goods that enabled the Company two years later to pay its shareholders a cash dividend of 70%, though the Company was to have relatively few other successes against the Spanish. In 1630, the Dutch occupied the Portuguese sugar-settlement of Pernambuco and over the next few years pushed inland, annexing the sugar plantations that surrounded it. In order to supply the plantations with the manpower they required, a successful expedition was launched in 1637 from Brazil to capture the Portuguese slaving post of Elmina, and in 1641 successfully captured the Portuguese settlements in Angola. In 1642, the Dutch captured the Portuguese possession of Axim in Africa. By 1650, the West India Company was firmly in control of both the sugar and slave trades, and had occupied the Caribbean islands of Sint Maarten, Curaçao, Aruba and Bonaire in order to guarantee access to the islands' salt-pans.

The premise does not specifically mention the groundlings' perception of Farrakhan holding the meat or their temptation upon seeing it. However, the premise provides some indications that can help in analyzing this hypothesis. First, let us understand the context provided by the premise. \\"Groundlings\\" refers to members of an audience who are not entirely committed to understanding the deeper meaning of the subject matter, instead seeking entertainment or excitement. The phrase \\"red meat\\" is a metaphor for provocative statements or controversial topics that the groundlings crave. Farrakhan, a public figure, starts his speech by presenting a peaceful image in the first act, but later abandons it to deliver more controversial statements, as demanded by the groundlings in the second act. His \\"spewing\\" is an indication of his shift in tone to satisfy the audience's craving for controversy. Given this context, we can interpret the hypothesis to mean that the groundlings feel tempted when they observe Farrakhan engaging with controversy, rather than literally showing them meat. This interpretation suggests that the groundlings are more interested in the emotional stimulation that comes from controversial subjects than in the peaceful discourse that Farrakhan initially offers. With this understanding, it seems reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis could be true, as it is supported by the fact that Farrakhan's shift in tone is a response to the groundlings' desires. While the hypothesis might not be directly stated in the premise, it can be inferred that the groundlings are indeed tempted by the metaphorical \\"meat\\" that Farrakhan presents when he abandons his initial peace-oriented message. Furthermore, Farrakhan's change in his approach in the second act implies that he recognizes this temptation among the groundlings and switches his strategy accordingly. In summary, although the premise does not directly confirm the hypothesis \\"The groundlings are tempted when they see Farrakhan with the meat,\\" it can be inferred that the groundlings become more engaged when Farrakhan shifts his tone to present controversial topics. The hypothesis, therefore, could be considered true within the context provided by the premise."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"Xestobium\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

One of the most significant factors in achieving success in fitness is consistency, which plays a vital role in improving one's health and wellbeing. In this article, we will explore the importance of finding a time that works for you and sticking to it, building up your skills and comfort level before incorporating new elements to your workout, and how signing up for a personal trainer can be a game-changer in your fitness journey. Finding a Time That Works for You Exercising at the same time every day is conducive to establishing a habit and creating consistency. Our bodies have an internal clock called the circadian rhythm, which influences various physiological processes like metabolism, energy levels, and hormone production. By adhering to a consistent workout schedule, you can optimize your body's performance and make the most out of your exercise. Here are some tips to find the best time that works for you: 1. Consider your personal preferences: Reflect on the times of the day when you feel most energetic and motivated. Some people thrive in the morning, while others prefer exercising in the evening. 2. Take your work and family responsibilities into account: Stick to a time that doesn't conflict with your job or personal commitments, ensuring that you won't be routinely interrupted during your workouts. 3. Be mindful of your lifestyle: If you frequently attend social events in the evenings, it may be best to set aside time for workouts in the morning or afternoon. Building Skills and Comfort Level When starting a new fitness routine, it's essential to gradually build your comfort level and skills to avoid injury and maintain your motivation. For long-term success, start with a manageable workout plan and progressively increase its intensity, duration, and complexity. Here's how to build your skills and comfort level: 1. Begin with the basics: Start by mastering fundamental exercises like squats, push-ups, and planks. Focusing on form and technique will ensure you have a solid foundation for more advanced moves. 2. Listen to your body: Learn to distinguish between healthy discomfort and pain, adjusting your workouts accordingly. If an exercise causes pain, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional. 3. Set realistic goals: Create achievable and measurable goals by setting clear milestones. Celebrate your accomplishments and use them as motivation for future progress. 4. Track your progress: Keep a workout journal to record your exercise routine, including duration, intensity, and improvements over time. This will help you analyze your progress and make necessary adjustments to your plan. Incorporating Personal Training A personal trainer can be invaluable in helping you develop a tailored workout plan that addresses your unique fitness goals while providing ongoing guidance and support. The advantages of working with a personal trainer include: 1. Customized program: Personal trainers take into account factors like your fitness level, goals, and lifestyle to craft a workout regimen tailored to your needs. 2. Expert guidance: They can teach you proper exercise technique, help you set realistic goals, and offer advice on nutrition and lifestyle changes to improve your overall health. 3. Accountability and motivation: Having regular appointments with a personal trainer keeps you on track and committed to your fitness journey, enhancing your chances of achieving your goals. 4. Progress tracking and adjustments: Personal trainers monitor your progress and adjust your training program as needed, ensuring that you continue to make improvements over time. Conclusion Staying consistent and adapting your workout routine according to your skill level and comfort are critical factors in achieving long-lasting fitness success. Additionally, enlisting the help of a personal trainer can provide valuable guidance, motivation, and customization of your workout plan.

Un-neutered male cats are the most likely culprits to engage in this very undesirable behavior. Occasionally un-spayed females will do this as well.","completion":"Therefore, it is essential to get your cat spayed or neutered as soon as they reach the appropriate age (usually around five to six months old). Doing so will help prevent them from developing the habit of spraying. However, if your cat has already begun spraying, there are several steps you can take to minimize and possibly eliminate this behavior. 1. Identify the cause of spraying: In some cases, cats spray due to stress or anxiety. Identifying any changes in your cat's environment, such as the introduction of a new family member, pet, or a change in the household routine, may help determine the root cause of their stress. Addressing these issues can help alleviate your cat's anxiety and stop the spraying behavior. 2. Provide additional litter boxes: Cats may spray urine if they feel they do not have enough access to clean litter boxes. Be sure to provide multiple litter boxes throughout the home, especially in larger households with multiple cats. Additionally, make sure to clean the litter boxes regularly and avoid using scented litter, as some cats may not like the smell. 3. Use pheromone therapy: Pheromone therapy can help reduce stress and anxiety in cats. Using synthetic cat pheromones, such as Feliway, in your home can help create a calming environment for your cat and reduce the likelihood of them spraying. These products come in various forms, such as diffusers, sprays, and collars. 4. Create a positive environment: Providing your cat with a comfortable and safe environment can help reduce stress and discourage spraying. Enrich their living space with interactive toys, scratching posts, and hiding spots. Make sure to also provide them with a space where they can retreat to if they feel threatened or stressed. 5. Clean and deodorize sprayed areas: If your cat has already sprayed in certain areas, be sure to clean them thoroughly using an enzyme-based cleaner specifically designed for cleaning up cat urine. This will help remove any lingering odor and reduce the likelihood of your cat returning to spray in the same spot. 6. Block access to sprayed areas: In some cases, it may be necessary to block off or restrict access to the areas where your cat has sprayed. This can help break the habit and discourage them from spraying in those areas again. 7. Consult with a veterinarian: If you have tried all of these methods and your cat continues to spray, it is essential to consult with a veterinarian. They can conduct a thorough examination and determine if there are any underlying medical issues contributing to the spraying behavior, such as urinary tract infections or other health problems. 8. Seek professional help: In some cases, working with a professional cat behaviorist can be beneficial in addressing and resolving spraying issues. They can provide personalized guidance and solutions based on your cat's specific needs and circumstances, helping you to establish an effective plan to deter your cat from spraying. In conclusion, to prevent a cat from spraying, it is essential to address the root cause of their behavior. Getting your cat spayed or neutered, identifying and managing any stressors, providing a safe and stimulating environment, and seeking veterinary assistance if necessary, can all help prevent and reduce spraying behavior in cats. Be patient and consistent with your efforts, and over time, you should see a decrease in your cat's spraying habits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What kind of parents make the happiest child? Possible A: birth, act of sex, loving couple, parents, adoption Why is \\"loving couple\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Loving couple\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it takes into account the emotional and psychological well-being of the child, which is crucial for their overall happiness. In contrast, the other answers focus on the method of becoming parents, which may not necessarily correlate with the child's happiness. A loving couple typically demonstrates qualities like care, understanding, kindness, patience, and support, which are all crucial in fostering a nurturing environment for a child to grow up in. Research has shown that children who are raised in loving and supportive environments tend to be happier and more resilient, as they feel secure and valued. They are also more likely to develop positive social skills and adapt better to various challenges in life. The other options do not directly convey the emotional and supportive aspect that a child needs to be happy: 1. \\"Birth\\" and \\"act of sex\\" refer to the biological and physical aspects of parenthood, which, while important, do not necessarily ensure the happiness of the child. 2. \\"Parents\\" is a broad term that can include various types of parental figures – loving, unloving, supportive, or unsupportive. Therefore, it is not specific enough to highlight the importance of love and care in raising a happy child. 3. \\"Adoption\\" is a method of creating a family, which can include a loving couple as well as other types of family structures. Adoption in itself does not guarantee a happy child, but the love and support provided by the adoptive parents would significantly contribute to their happiness. Hence, \\"loving couple\\" aligns with human common sense because it emphasizes the emotional aspect of parenting that plays a crucial role in nurturing a happy, well-adjusted child."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The remaining officers were from the Merchant Marine, including Albert Armitage, the second-in-command, who had experience with the Jackson–Harmsworth Arctic expedition, 1894–97, and Ernest Shackleton, designated Third Officer in charge of holds, stores and provisions, and responsible for arranging the entertainments. The Admiralty also released around twenty petty officers and seamen, the rest of the crew being from the merchant service, or from civilian employment. Among the lower deck complement were some who became Antarctic veterans, including Frank Wild, William Lashly, Thomas Crean (who joined the expedition following the desertion of a seaman in New Zealand), Edgar Evans and Ernest Joyce.

(August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The story follows the escape of two men from an Alaska prison, the efforts of a railroad dispatch office to safely stop the out-of-control train they are on, and the hunt by their warden to recapture them. Oscar \\"Manny\\" Manheim is a ruthless bank robber and hero to the convicts of Stonehaven Maximum Security Prison. After two previous escape attempts, the doors to Manny's cell were welded shut for three years. A court order compels Manny's nemesis, the vindictive and sadistic Associate Warden Ranken, to release him back into the general prison population. Manny intends to break out a third time with his older brother Jonah, but he is forced to set his escape plan into action in the middle of winter after Ranken employs a serial killer to stab him. Jonah stabs his attacker to death in retaliation and in turn is severely beaten by a prison guard, leaving him in a high-security hospital wing. Manny has to leave his brother behind. He recruits Buck McGeehy, who was convicted of statutory rape and who works in the prison's laundry room, to smuggle him out in a trolley. Buck decides to join Manny in the escape, even though Manny wants to go it alone. After a freezing cross-country hike (involving a 300Â ft drop into a river and subsequent swim) the two hop on board a train consisting of four locomotives at a remote Alaskan rail yard. Both men enter the fourth unit and stow away in the toilet compartment. Just as the train starts to move, the elderly engineer suffers a heart attack. In attempting to stop the train and get off, he does not set the throttle to idle, instead engaging the brakes, before collapsing off the still-moving train.

A: Choose from: * molecules * electrons * compounds * protons The answer is:","completion":"All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons in their nucleus, though they may have different numbers of neutrons. To elaborate on this, let's first understand some basic atomic structure. An atom, which is the smallest unit of an element, consists of a nucleus and electrons orbiting around it. The nucleus is located at the center of the atom and contains two types of subatomic particles: protons and neutrons. Protons are positively charged particles while neutrons have no charge, and both contribute to the mass of the atom. Orbiting around the nucleus, the electrons are negatively charged particles. Each element has its unique atomic number (Z) which represents the number of protons in its nucleus. This defines the element and determines its chemical properties. No two elements have the same atomic number, and it is the presence of the exact same number of protons that gives each element its specific characteristics. For example, if an atom has one proton, it is hydrogen. If it has two protons, it is helium. While protons define the element, neutrons can vary in number among the atoms of a single element. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Most elements have more than one isotope, and these isotopes have the same chemical properties but slightly different physical properties, primarily due to their differences in mass. For instance, carbon has two stable isotopes: carbon-12, which consists of 6 protons and 6 neutrons, and carbon-13, with 6 protons and 7 neutrons. In summary, all the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons, which define the element, in their nucleus. Neutrons can differ among the atoms of the same element, giving rise to isotopes with unique properties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

By practicing good hygiene, you can significantly reduce the chance of mold spores landing on bread or other food items. This is achieved by creating an environment that is less conducive to mold growth and spread, rather than directly interfering with a specific step in the mold growth process. Here are some ways good hygiene can help indirectly impact the process: 1. Storing food properly: Keeping bread and other food items in sealed containers will make it more challenging for mold spores to come into contact with the food. In addition, proper storage may help maintain the freshness of the food for a longer period of time. 2. Regular cleaning: Routinely cleaning surfaces and areas where food is prepared or stored will help eliminate contaminants that could carry mold spores. This includes wiping counters, washing utensils and cutting boards, and emptying trash cans. 3. Monitoring moisture levels: Mold thrives in damp and humid environments. Controlling the moisture level in your home can make it less appealing for mold spores to settle and grow. This includes ensuring adequate ventilation and using dehumidifiers when necessary. 4. Addressing mold growth promptly: If mold does appear in your living space, it is essential to address the issue immediately and thoroughly to prevent further spread. This includes removing moldy items, cleaning affected areas with mold-killing solutions, and taking measures to address the underlying cause of the mold growth. 5. Personal hygiene: Washing your hands regularly and thoroughly, especially before handling food, can prevent the transfer of mold spores from your hands to the bread or other food items. By maintaining good hygienic practices, you can create an environment that is less hospitable for mold spores to spread and grow. While this does not directly impact any specific step of the mold growth process, it does indirectly impact the process by reducing the chances of mold spores coming into contact with food items such as bread."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Facebook, in particular, has been criticized for failing to provide GCHQ with five of Michael Adebowale's 11 accounts. This not only hints at a lack of cooperation between internet companies and security agencies but also raises questions about whether Facebook should be held responsible for its content. Adebowale, one of Rigby's murderers, had used Facebook as a platform to express his violent intentions. Staff at the social media giant failed to inform the security services of these \\"graphic and emotive\\" posts, including one where Adebowale told an Al Qaeda extremist, \\"Let's kill a soldier\\". Lee Rigby's family has publicly blamed MI5 and internet companies, including Facebook, for failing to prevent the attack. Sister Sara McClure went as far as stating, \\"Facebook has my brother's blood on their hands. I hold them partly responsible for Lee's murder.\\" This case has sparked a contentious debate between civil liberty groups and proponents of increased surveillance. Civil liberty organizations argue that this \\"appalling murder\\" should not be used as an excuse to \\"justify further surveillance and monitoring of the entire UK population.\\" On the other hand, MPs have been accused of \\"spin\\" to divert attention from the failings of MI5 and MI6, the UK's intelligence agencies.

Lee Rigby's stepfather, Ian, seeks answers from Prime Minister David Cameron, noting, \\"We have lost a son, but we have never been able to mourn Lee.\\" Cameron's spokesman has confirmed that the Prime Minister is willing to meet with the family to discuss their concerns. The Rigby case highlights the challenges faced by intelligence agencies, such as MI5, MI6, and GCHQ, in monitoring potential terror threats.

MI6 has been criticized for their \\"deeply unsatisfactory\\" response when Adebolajo attempted to join Al Shabaab terrorists in Kenya. He was subsequently dismissed as a drug dealer weeks before Rigby's murder and fell off the official radar.

Baby boomers, people born between 1946 and 1965, will on average earn £740,000 during their lives, according to the Resolution Foundation. Generation X, those now aged between 35 and 50, are projected to earn 13% more than that - £835,000 on average. But the figure for millennials, the under-35s, is lower than that - they are forecast to earn £825,000 over their working lives. Laura Gardiner, author of the Resolution Foundation's report Stagnation Generation found a range of reasons for the dismal outlook for millennials. Laura, a millennial herself, says the timing of the financial crisis was particularly bad for her generation. \\"This pay squeeze in particular hit millennials just at the point you expect your pay to be rising most quickly, in your early twenties,\\" she says. There's still a chance that millennials' lifetime earnings could outstrip those of their parents because they are likely to live longer and work longer, Laura says. She adds, however, that the slowdown in productivity growth (which affects national income) and the rise of insecure or precarious work, such as zero-hours contracts, self employment and short-term contracts, could prove so devastating that millennials would still earn less than their parents. Claudia Wells, who is 24, graduated from university in 2015 and since then has had a series of temporary and short-term contracts, the most recent of which has taken her to France. \\"In today's market,\\" she says, \\"finding a job can be hard.\\" Claudia also faces other financial burdens compared with her baby boomer father Ian. As soon as she starts earning more than £21,000 she will have to start paying off more than £40,000 of student debt. Ian compares his daughter's circumstances with his own: \\"At 23 I was in a secure, big company job with a good pension scheme, I had bought my first modest house and I was paying off a mortgage, not student debt.\\" \\"I live in a shared house and the idea of me or any of my friends owning a house by ourselves is pretty unforeseeable,\\" Claudia says. In fact, by the age of 30, Claudia's generation are 50% less likely to own their own homes than their baby boomer parents. Almost two-thirds of Ian's generation were homeowners by the same age. Part of the problem is that supply has failed to keep up with demand for housing as the population has grown. And Angus Hanton, co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation, which exists to promote fairness between the generations, believes that older people are hogging the housing that is available. \\"Partly,\\" he says, \\"because they are living longer and partly because there aren't suitable places to downsize to, but they are taking more than their share.\\" This matters for Claudia's generation because property remains the single biggest asset owned by people in the UK and is a valuable source of wealth and, potentially, rental income in later life. Ian and his wife own their home outright and receive rental income from properties overseas that will supplement his already generous defined benefits pension and large savings pot, should he choose to retire. For \\"generation rent\\" - as millennials are also known - their retirement prospects look a lot bleaker. Not only are they more likely to forego income and wealth from owning property, they also face much higher pension costs. And, despite the start of auto-enrolment into company pension schemes, the shift towards defined contribution pensions and the rise in self-employment (excluded from auto-enrolment) could dramatically reduce millennials' retirement income. The state is often seen as the arbiter of fairness between generations. But, there is evidence that government policy itself may have widened the intergenerational divide. Prof Sir John Hills of the London School of Economics found that baby boomers were, on average, net beneficiaries of the welfare state - they will get more in benefits than they have paid in tax. They have enjoyed tax cuts and a boom in welfare spending. Subsequent generations, by contrast, are likely to be net contributors over their lifetimes and get back less than they have paid in, thanks to austerity cuts to state benefits. \\"The older generation have more voting power... they lobby more, the MPs and the policy makers are more likely to be baby boomers so [young people's] interests tend to be treated as less important,\\" says Angus Hanton. So government decisions to protect the state pensions with a \\"triple lock\\" guaranteeing an annual rise of at least 2.5%, at a time when other working-age benefits are being cut, has added to the controversy over intergenerational fairness. \\"In the UK we have a huge number of pensioners who are wealthy, probably two million over-60s who live in households with more than a million pounds' worth of assets,\\" adds Angus. \\"It seems odd that they should be getting this handout of the state pension.\\" Not everyone, however, puts the blame quite so squarely on the shoulders of the older generations. \\"I would dispute the fact that the generations are at war,\\" says Baroness Greengross, president of the Pensions Policy Institute. \\"The older generation has no desire to fight the younger generation... these are their children and grandchildren.\\" There is evidence that, in some countries at least, state level transfers of wealth from the young are, to some extent, offset by private transfers from old to young within families. And, Ian admits that, like most parents, he is setting aside money to help Claudia get on to the housing ladder. Talking Business: Generations at War will be broadcast on BBC World News at 15:30 GMT on Friday, 13 January and on the BBC News Channel at 20:30 GMT on Saturday, 14 January. This article was about:","completion":"The question of whether baby boomers are to blame for the economic difficulties experienced by millennials is complex and multifaceted. Baby boomers, who enjoyed economic good times, tax cuts, and free higher education, benefited significantly from these advantages, but it is essential to consider various factors before establishing who is at fault. One key aspect that has affected millennials disproportionately is the global financial crisis of 2008. The timing of the crisis was particularly bad for this generation, hitting them during a period when their pay would typically be rising, causing a persistent pay squeeze. While some argue that millennials could still outperform their parents over their lifetime earnings due to a longer life and work duration, others believe that slow productivity growth and the rise of unstable work (i.e., zero-hour contracts, self-employment, and short-terms contracts) make it unlikely. In addition, housing has become a significant issue for millennials, with home ownership at the age of 30 down to 50% compared to the baby boomer generation. The increase in housing demand due to population growth, insufficient housing supply, and older generations using up more housing stock than previous generations, have contributed to the current predicament for millennials. Moreover, millennials face financial burdens, including student loans, that their parents did not. These loan repayments delay their ability to build wealth and plan for the future. Millennials are also part of the \\"generation rent,\\" whereby they are unlikely to benefit from home ownership and rental income in their retirement. Furthermore, with the shift towards defined contribution pensions and the rise in self-employment, millennials' retirement income could be considerably less than their parents'. To compound these issues, government policy has seemingly widened the generational divide. Decisions to protect state pensions under a \\"triple lock\\" while other working-age benefits are cut have added to the controversy over intergenerational fairness. However, while some argue that baby boomers have benefitted at the expense of younger generations, others maintain that older individuals have no intention to harm their children or grandchildren, instead, offering financial support to help them navigate these economic challenges. Ultimately, the causes of millennials' economic difficulties are numerous, involving a range of interconnected factors such as the financial crisis, housing market imbalances, government policies, pension changes, and student loan burdens. While it is undeniably true that baby boomers benefited from a more favorable economic climate, it is overly simplistic to attribute blame solely to this generation. Factors such as global economic trends and political decision-making have also played a significant role in shaping the current economic landscape for millennials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In white pines there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work.

Given the standings of the two men, the painting was received in both social and political terms. A number of writers mentioned Bertin's eventful career, in tones that were, according to art historian Andrew Carrington Shelton, either \\"bitingly sarcastic [or] fawningly reverential\\". There were many satirical reproductions and pointed editorials in the following years. Aware of Bertin's support of the July Monarchy, writers at the La Gazette de France viewed the portrait as the epitome of the \\"opportunism and cynicism\\" of the new regime. Their anonymous critic excitedly wondered \\"what bitter irony it expresses, what hardened skepticism, sarcasm and ... pronounced cynicism\\".Several critics mentioned Bertin's hands. Twentieth-century art historian Albert Boime described them as \\"powerful, vulturine ... grasping his thighs in a gesture ... projecting ... enormous strength controlled\\". Some contemporary critics were not so kind. The photographer and critic Félix Tournachon was harshly critical, and disparaged what he saw as a \\"fantastical bundle of flesh ... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!\\" Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: \\"A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality ... the energetic and mighty nature\\".The work's realism attracted a large amount of commentary when it was first exhibited. Some saw it as an affront to Romanticism, others said that its small details not only showed an acute likeness, but built a psychological profile of the sitter. Art historian Geraldine Pelles sees Bertin as \\"at once intense, suspicious, and aggressive\\". She notes that there is a certain amount of projection of the artist's personality and recalls Théophile Silvestre's description of Ingres;...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please write a short summary for the following article: Donald Trump, Seeking Ambassadors, Sorts Through Competing Priorities So far, Mr. Friedman is the exception. As the intense jockeying for ambassadorships has begun among donors, loyalists to Mr. Trump and, in some cases, people close to his children, his advisers have potentially competing priorities. If Mr. Trump chooses Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets who is a longtime Republican donor and a friend of the president-elect, or someone like Peter S. Kalikow, the New York developer and Trump supporter, he would be following a familiar script. If he chooses someone like Jon M. Huntsman Jr. for Japan, Mr. Trump would be trying to match a Republican establishment figure with a region he is familiar with. Mr. Huntsman has served as ambassador to China and Singapore. If he goes for someone like Robert Pence, a Virginia developer who did not support Mr. Trump’s candidacy but who has been recommended by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, it would fall more in line with his choice of Ms. Haley and of bringing outsiders into the fold. (The two Pences are not related). The expectation is that Mr. Trump will begin by rewarding supporters with appointments to Western Europe or the Caribbean, as is often the case with new administrations. But they could also include donors to his campaign or transition, people he might need again in the future. “They generally start out more political,” said Asgeir Sigfusson, the communications director for the American Foreign Service Association. “The numbers will even out.” In previous administrations, he said, about 70 percent of nominations were foreign service professionals and 30 percent were political appointees. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump will adhere to that breakdown, Mr. Sigfusson said. Aides to Mr. Trump declined to comment, beyond saying that discussion about candidates was in the early stages. There are some favorites among the names Mr. Trump’s advisers are batting around, however, and meetings on the subject are expected to increase in frequency starting this week. Mr. Trump’s aides are sifting through a broad list of recommendations from people involved in the transition process, including the president-elect’s daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. As a result, the suggestions have included people who did not immediately support the Trump ticket, such as Ronald J. Gidwitz, who backed Jeb Bush in the primaries. There have been some aspirational suggestions, such as Mr. Huntsman, who served as ambassador to China in the Obama administration, for Japan; or Michèle A. Flournoy, a top Pentagon official in the Obama administration, as an ambassador to NATO. The two have deep knowledge of policy and have been spoken of favorably by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief White House strategist. But a number of Mr. Trump’s top advisers oppose them. Then there are more personal recommendations from people involved in the transition. One was for Morris Goldfarb, the chief executive of the G-III Apparel Group, which had a licensing agreement for Ms. Trump’s apparel line. Another was former Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia, who has been recommended by Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, a Trump adviser. Ivana Trump, Mr. Trump’s first wife, cheekily recommended herself to The New York Post for ambassador to the Czech Republic. John Jay LaValle, chairman of the Suffolk County Republican Committee in New York and one of Mr. Trump’s few vocal defenders in the campaign’s final days, could see a plum post. And there are a raft of donors and longtime Republicans angling for appointments who could expect particularly close scrutiny by Democrats during confirmation hearings. “I think confirmation is always problematic,” said Mel Sembler, a party fund-raiser appointed ambassador to Australia by the elder President George Bush and to Italy by the younger. “The first time out, it was a long and embarrassing and difficult process,” Mr. Sembler said. Old scars become new information as senators start their review, he said. Some donors could see old troubles resurface. Mr. Kalikow, the New York developer, who filed for personal bankruptcy when he owned The New York Post more than two decades ago, has been mentioned for a possible post. So has Georgette Mosbacher, a socialite whose husband, now deceased, was the focus of a lawsuit over a flawed census count in 1990. Neither Mr. Kalikow nor Ms. Mosbacher would comment for this article. Duke Buchan, major supporter of Jeb Bush and a defender of the work of Right to Rise, the “super PAC” backing that candidate, joined the Trump effort in the summer and contributed significantly to his campaign. Mr. Buchan has expressed interest in becoming ambassador to Spain, where he says he studied and where a company he once held stock in recently owned property. He also used to own shares in a company that holds military contracts, records show. Mr. Buchan, who does not know Mr. Trump well, has had blunt discussions about how to best position himself for an ambassadorship, according to people close to the transition. He did not respond to requests for comment. Fred V. Malek, a former aide to President Richard M. Nixon and to the elder President Bush, said that being a donor did not guarantee anything. “It doesn’t mean that somebody can be a fund-raiser and just have an ambassadorship,” he said. “They have to have some credentials.” At least two prospective candidates from the donor community, according to people with direct knowledge of the discussions, are likely to end up with posts. Lewis M. Eisenberg, the Republican National Committee finance chairman who raised money with Mr. Trump’s choice for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is seen as a possible choice for Italy. Mr. Johnson, the Jets owner, is a leading choice for Britain. Joseph Forgione, who was passed over for secretary of housing and development, has support to become ambassador to the Vatican. So does William E. Simon Jr., an ally of Rudolph W. Giuliani, who recommended him. R. Nicholas Burns, an ambassador to Greece under President Bill Clinton, said that the State Department typically put forward a list of people to consider, and that incoming presidents should be aware of their options. “I think President-elect Trump would be well advised to broaden the circle of people he consults in making these appointments,” Mr. Burns said. An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the corporate role of Morris Goldfarb. He remains the chief executive of the G-III Apparel Group, and did not recently leave that post.

Plot title: Queen of the Vampires Movie plot: The Rape of the Vampire[edit] Four sisters living in an old chÃ¢teau are convinced that they are vampires. One believes she was raped by the villagers years before, and is blind. Another is afraid of sunlight. They all react violently to crucifixes. The sisters are being manipulated by a sinister old man who alternates between admonishing them to kill newcomers that threaten their exposure, and groping their breasts. The four seem to worship a bestial idol in the forest who speaks to them with a disembodied voice. The newcomers are three Parisians, Thomas (Bernard Letrou), Brigitte (Solange Pradle) and Marc (Marquis Polho), who have come to the countryside to cure the sisters of their so-called illness. They do not believe that the sisters are vampires, and don't believe in vampires at all. Thomas is a psychoanalyist, determined to cure them from their madness. He believes it has been induced by the superstitious villagers, who have driven the confused women insane with their religious symbols and persecution. He tries to convince them that crucifixes and sunlight won't harm them, and that the blind sister can actually see. He takes all of this as proof that their vampirism is all in their minds. When one of the sisters fall for Thomas' charms, the old man orders another sister to kill him, Brigitte and Marc. When this fails, he unleashes the peasants, who brutally murder all the women they can find, which also includes Brigitte. Thomas asks one of the sisters to bite him to prove her wrong, and discovers she is, in fact, a vampire, and that he was misled by his own preconceptions. The two flee to the beach and are gunned down by Marc, who is distraught by Brigitte's death at the hands of the peasants.

Yes The answer you provided, \\"A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States and United Kingdom, resulting in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya and United Nations-imposed economic sanctions,\\" is a good answer to the question \\"How did the world respond to Libya in 1986?\\" because it accurately summarizes the events and actions surrounding that year's international treatment of Libya. While it is a concise answer, it nonetheless encapsulates two significant responses towards Libya during that time. The 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya, also known as Operation El Dorado Canyon, was a response to a series of terroristic activities linked to the Libyan government under Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. The operation, which occurred on April 15, 1986, targeted multiple Libyan military installations and was overseen by the Reagan Administration. The primary goal of the operation was to deter Gaddafi's support of terrorist activities and bring an end to his regime's sponsorship of such acts. This bombing attack was just one component of the hostile relationship mentioned in the answer. In addition to military force, economic sanctions were imposed by the international community, led by the United States and the United Kingdom. These sanctions were introduced through Resolution 748, adopted by the United Nations Security Council on March 31, 1992. The resolution demanded that Libya comply with the investigation and prosecution of those suspected of being involved in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland – another terror attack that was traced back to the Libyan government. The sanctions included freeze of assets, travel bans on Libyan officials, and an embargo on arms and air traffic in and out of Libya. These economic sanctions further exacerbated the strained relationships with the United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western powers.

I have it on an old LP and listen to it and enjoy it frequently, as Hazlewood's music is catchy and the way he and Sinatra's voices work together is magic. Recently, while surfing on eBay, I came across an import CD release which has 9 of the 11 songs from 'Nancy & Lee\\" plus another 11 that Nancy did solo, and even one with Frank \\"Something Stupid\\". This CD ran about 6.95 and is digitally remastered and plays great. It's listed simply as Nancy Sinatra Greatest Hits or something close to that.

So why doesn't whoever owns Reprise Records realize they are losing some serious money by not re-releasing this great record.

Stepping off the train amidst the volatile weather, Prince Charles continued with his goodwill visit, meeting with local artisans and sampling their products. Paragraph 1: The Royal Visit Prince Charles arrived in Lancashire via train, no doubt eager to learn more about the area's thriving food industry and eager to meet the craftsmen behind it all.

His visit is an important gesture that highlights the significance of local food producers for the country's economy and its people.

Lancashire is known for its dedication to innovation and quality in food production, and the region's food producers embody the spirit of hard work and determination needed to succeed in this challenging industry. The Prince's determination to proceed with his visit in the face of inclement weather resonates with the very spirit that drives the Lancashire food industry. Paragraph 3: Tour and Tastings During his visit, Prince Charles was given a tour of several local food producers' facilities, meeting with the artisans and craftsmen responsible for creating the region's culinary delights. He sampled an array of products, including cheeses, meats, and baked goods. By personally tasting these goods, Prince Charles reinforces not only the high-quality output of Lancashire food producers but also the importance of preserving the traditional methods that have long characterized this region's food industry.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which runner has a greater chance of getting a tendon injury? Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).

Congress should address this problem. We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this. Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security.

Henry Hill, Jr. was born on June 11, 1943 in Manhattan, New York, to Henry Hill, Sr., an Irish immigrant and electrician, and Carmela Costa Hill, a Sicilian. The working-class family consisted of Henry and his eight siblings who grew up in Brownsville, a poorer area of the East New York section of Brooklyn. From an early age, Hill admired the local mobsters who socialized across the street from his home, including Paul Vario, a capo in the Lucchese crime family. In 1955, when Hill was 11 years old, he wandered into the cabstand across the street looking for a part-time after-school job. Hill testified against his former associates to avoid a possible execution by his crew or going to prison for his crimes. His testimony led to 50 convictions. Jimmy Burke was given 20 years in prison for the 1978-79 Boston College point shaving scandal, involving fixing Boston College basketball games. Burke was also later sentenced to life in prison for the murder of scam artist Richard Eaton. Burke died of lung cancer while serving his life sentence, on April 13, 1996, at the age of 64. Paul Vario received four years for helping Henry Hill obtain a no-show job to get him paroled from prison. Vario was also later sentenced to ten years in prison for the extortion of air freight companies at JFK Airport. He died of respiratory failure on November 22, 1988, at age 73 while incarcerated in the FCI Federal Prison in Fort Worth. Hill, his wife Karen, and their two children (Gregg and Gina) entered the U.S. Marshals' Witness Protection Program in 1980, changed their names, and moved to undisclosed locations in Omaha, Nebraska; Independence, Kentucky; Redmond, Washington; and Seattle, Washington. In Seattle, Hill hosted backyard cookouts for his neighbors, and on one occasion, while under the influence of a combination of liquor and drugs, he revealed his true identity to his guests. To the ire of the federal marshals, they were forced to relocate him one final time to Sarasota, Florida. There, a few months had passed, and Hill repeated the same breach of security, causing the government to finally expel him from the Federal Witness Protection Program.

Write an article based on this summary: A rogue Venezuelan policeman who used a stolen helicopter to fire on government buildings has re-emerged at an opposition vigil.","completion":"Title: Rogue Venezuelan Policeman Re-emerges at Opposition Vigil Introduction In a surprising turn of events in Venezuela, Óscar Pérez, the rogue policeman who notoriously stolen a helicopter to attack government buildings, has made a public appearance at an opposition vigil. Pérez's reappearance raises questions about his motives and the future of Venezuela's political landscape. In this article, we explore the details of this incident, discuss the context surrounding it, and analyze its potential implications for the country's ongoing crisis. Background Step 1: Summarize the helicopter incident Óscar Pérez first gained notoriety in June 2017 when he and a group of accomplices stole a helicopter from a police airbase. They used the aircraft to stage an audacious attack on the Supreme Court and Interior Ministry buildings in Caracas, launching grenades and firing shots in a brazen act of defiance against President Nicolas Maduro's government. Although the attack caused panic in the capital city, it resulted in no casualties or significant damages. Step 2: Provide context on the political situation in Venezuela Venezuela's political crisis has deep roots, with hyperinflation, food shortages, and social unrest leading to widespread dissatisfaction with the ruling regime. The opposition, led by the National Assembly, has been in a constant tussle with President Maduro and his United Socialist Party for power, leading to street protests, international pressure, and attempts to recall the president through a referendum. The Re-emergence Step 1: Describe the opposition vigil Pérez reappeared in public in early 2018, attending an opposition vigil to pay tribute to the victims of the political crisis and anti-government protests. He appeared wearing a hat with the Venezuelan flag's colors and addressed a small crowd that had gathered to show support for the opposition. Pérez's presence at the vigil brings renewed attention to his actions and the country's ongoing unrest. Step 2: Analyze Pérez's possible motives It is unclear what exactly motivated Pérez to re-emerge in such a public manner. There are various theories, with some suggesting that he is seeking redemption, while others believe that he is attempting to elevate his status as a symbol of resistance or even pursue a political career of his own. Regardless of his intentions, Pérez's reappearance at the vigil highlights the volatile situation in Venezuela and the depth of the divisions within the country. Implications Step 1: Assess the impact on the political landscape Pérez's re-emergence at the opposition vigil may not change the political landscape substantially. However, his affiliation with the opposition could potentially strengthen their narrative and enhance the pressure on Maduro's government. Furthermore, his presence might also inspire other dissidents within the security forces to take similar actions against the government, increasing the risk of further instability. Step 2: Examine the potential impact on security Aside from the political implications, Pérez's reappearance raises questions about the overall security and authority of the Venezuelan government. His initial helicopter attack demonstrated the ability of opponents to penetrate government security measures and acquire resources like military-grade hardware. The fact that Pérez remains at large despite a highly publicized manhunt underscores the challenge that the Maduro government faces in maintaining control over the country. Conclusion Óscar Pérez's return to the public eye at an opposition vigil is a stark reminder of the deep divisions and unrest within Venezuela. While his motives for re-emerging remain uncertain, his actions and the government's inability to apprehend him serve as a testament to the volatile and precarious nature of the political climate. As the country continues to grapple with a severe economic crisis and political divisions, the risk of further upheaval remains very real."},{"prompt":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What's the full name of the person who invites Matt to a party? , can you please find it? Matt Franklin is a recent MIT graduate who works at a Los Angeles Suncoast Video store in 1988 while trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life, something that his police officer father has grown impatient with. While working one day, Matt's high school crush, Tori Frederking walks into the store. After pretending that he doesn't work there and saying that he works at Goldman Sachs in an effort to impress her, Tori invites Matt to a Labor Day party, hosted by Matt's twin sister Wendy's boyfriend, Kyle Masterson, at his hillside home. Later that night, Matt, Wendy, and Matt's best friend, Barry Nathan, head to the party. On the drive over, Barry steals a brand new Mercedes-Benz convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that Matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress Tori. The trio arrive at the party. While there, Matt catches up with an old classmate (who actually works at Goldman Sachs) and then awkwardly tries to woo Tori. Barry snorts some cocaine he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and Wendy's boyfriend proposes to her in front of everyone at the party.

Wells then murders the thief in cold blood, presumably so that he can take the treasure for himself, which he believes to be hidden in van Gorder's house.

Summarize: Fill a lawn roller ¾ full of water and walk it over the entire sod. This presses down the sod to ensure good root contact with the soil before watering. Keeping the grass moist during the first few weeks is essential. During this time, the grass roots are establishing and growing. Without plenty of water, this process will slow or halt, and the sod die before it takes. After the first two weeks, water the grass a few times a week to keep it from drying out. Use a sprinkler system to ensure the grass gets evenly watered. Don't wait until the grass looks brown to water it. Do a soil test by sticking your finger into the dirt. If the soil feels moist to a depth of several inches, it's fine. If the dirt feels dry on the surface or to a depth of an inch or two, it's time to water it. Shade-grown grass should be watered less frequently, since it holds dew longer. Water just to the point of puddling, then stop. If the sod lifts up off the soil, it has been overwatered. Mowing before the roots are well established can pull them out of the soil and damage your sod. Wait patiently until the grass is at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) tall, and gently pull up on several areas of sod to confirm it is firmly attached. Once the lawn is ready, mow it down to no shorter than ⅔ of its height, and never below 2 inches (5 cm). Always be sure the mower blades are sharp, straight and clean, Mow in a different directional pattern each time the grass is mowed to ensure even growth. You can bag the clippings, but leaving them on the lawn will actually improve its health, since they act as free fertilizer. Use the same starter fertilizer to dress the lawn after a month has passed. This is necessary to replace the nutrients that may have been washed away during a month of heavy watering. After the first month, you need only fertilize your grass once or twice a season to replace nutrients in the years to come. Keeping up with watering, mowing and fertilizing your lawn is the best way to grow thick, healthy grass, and it's also the best way to keep weeds away. Weeds tend to move in when the grass gets patchy. They're nature's way of covering up bare spots in the ground. If you make sure there aren't bare spots to begin with, you won't have to worry much about weeds. If you notice an area where the sod seems to be dead, replace it as soon as possible. Tear up the old sod, enrich the soil underneath with compost, and add fresh sod, making sure the seams lay right next to the healthy grass on either side. This will prevent weeds from coming up where the sod is dead.","completion":"To establish a healthy lawn using sod, follow these important steps: 1. Start by filling a lawn roller to ¾ of its capacity with water and walk it over the entire sod area. This helps press the sod down, ensuring its roots make good contact with the soil. 2. For the first few weeks, it is crucial to keep the grass moist, as the roots are establishing and growing. Water the lawn sufficiently to promote healthy root growth and prevent the sod from drying out or dying. 3. After the initial two weeks, maintain the lawn's moisture by watering it a few times a week. Use a sprinkler system for even distribution of water. Regularly check the soil's moisture levels with your finger. If it feels dry on the surface or at a depth of 1-2 inches, it's time to water. 4. Grass that grows in shaded areas typically requires less frequent watering, as it holds dew for more extended periods. Water just enough to avoid puddling and overwatering, which can cause the sod to lift off the soil. 5. Avoid mowing the lawn until the grass is at least 3 inches tall and the sod is firmly attached to the soil. Once the lawn is ready, only cut it down to no shorter than ⅔ of its height and never lower than 2 inches. Ensure you use sharp, clean, and straight mower blades. Additionally, alternate mowing patterns to promote even growth. 6. Although bagging clippings is an option, leaving them on the lawn can improve its health, acting as a natural fertilizer. 7. After a month has passed, apply the same starter fertilizer to replace nutrients possibly washed away because of heavy watering. In the future, you only need to fertilize the lawn once or twice a season. 8. Consistently maintain your lawn by watering, mowing, and fertilizing. This practice ensures thick, healthy grass growth and naturally keeps weeds at bay, as they tend to thrive in patchy areas. 9. If you spot any dead sod, replace it promptly. Remove the old sod, enrich the soil with compost, and install new sod while ensuring the seams are aligned with the healthy grass on either side. This prevents weeds from invading the dead sod area. By adhering to these guidelines, you will be able to establish a strong, healthy, and weed-free lawn from sod, ensuring optimal growth and long-term maintenance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

U.S. law enforcement agencies and Silicon Valley are getting ready to face off on the issue of privacy. This latest battle is focused on a 30-year-old law on government access to electronic communications and associated data. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act was a forward-looking statute when enacted in 1986, but technology has dramatically outpaced the ECPA. The U.S. Congress has been looking into ways to revise the law in order to preserve the privacy of internet users while also preserving the legal tools necessary for government agencies to enforce the law and protect the public. The late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called privacy \\"the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.\\" The Senate Judiciary Committee this week is considering an amendment to the ECPA that would expand the government's ability to collect data using a National Security Letter, which doesn't require a court order. The amendment would authorize the FBI to demand a person's internet browser history and internet protocol address, enabling investigators to see what websites a person visits, how much time is spent on a particular site and the location of the internet user — all without judicial oversight. The FBI contends that such data is covered implicitly under current statute, which was written years ago and only explicitly covers data normally associated with telephone records. FBI Director James Comey has said the amendment is needed to fix \\"a typo\\" in the ECPA that has hindered the bureau's ability to work in \\"a very, very big and practical way.\\" But a letter sent earlier this week warned Congress that such an amendment is opposed by tech giants and civil liberties organizations. \\"This expansion of the NSL statute has been characterized by some government officials as merely fixing ‘a typo' in the law,” the letter said. \\"In reality, however, it would dramatically expand the ability of the FBI to get sensitive information about users' online...

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"Schwarz-Schilling: The process related to free trade has begun to create a recognized economic community in Southeast Europe. The statement attributed to Schwarz-Schilling highlights the development of an economic community in Southeast Europe due to the establishment of free trade practices. The process of free trade allows countries to engage in commerce with one another without the interference of tariffs, import quotas, and other trade restrictions. This sort of economic cooperation is essential for fostering economic growth, increasing efficiency, and promoting international relationships among countries in the region. As a result of these efforts, Southeast Europe (a region that includes countries such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia) has experienced the growth of a thriving economic community. The increased exchange of goods, services, and investments among these countries has helped to strengthen their economies and establish new business opportunities, which leads to higher employment and improved living standards for the citizens of Southeast Europe. Having a recognized economic community can also help these countries to collectively negotiate better trade agreements and secure favorable market access conditions with countries outside their region. This can lead to increased exports and a stronger presence on the global market stage. Furthermore, the development of an economic community in Southeast Europe can contribute to political stability, as it encourages countries to work together for their common economic interests. This cooperation can help to reduce the likelihood of conflicts and promote stronger diplomatic relationships among these nations. Overall, the statement highlights that the process of free trade in Southeast Europe has led to the creation of a recognized and flourishing economic community. This has brought significant benefits for the region, including economic growth, improved trade relations, and greater political stability.

A: Pick your answer from: -- stays the same. -- reduces. -- mutates. -- increases. A:","completion":"As temperature increases, the solubility of the majority of solid substances typically increases. This phenomenon is related to the behavior of solid substances and their solute particles in a solvent when energy in the form of heat is applied. When a solid solute dissolves in a solvent, the particles of the solid separate and disperse throughout the solvent, and the process involves the conversion of the solute-solute interactions into solute-solvent interactions. This transformation is facilitated by the heat energy that increases the kinetic energy of the particles, allowing them to move faster and separate from each other. Besides, applying heat can disrupt intermolecular forces within the solute, such as ionic, covalent, and van der Waals bonds. Meanwhile, the increased kinetic energy also helps the solute particles collide more frequently with solvent particles, which further enhances the solute's dissolution process. However, the relationship between temperature and solubility is not always linear or uniform among all solid substances. The solubility of specific substances, such as certain salts, may decrease with an increase in temperature. Additionally, the solubility of gases in a solvent typically decreases as temperature increases due to the increased kinetic energy causing a higher tendency of gases to escape the solution. Nevertheless, the general observation remains valid for the majority of solid substances – as temperature increases, solubility increases as well. This principle lays the foundation for numerous applications across different industries, ranging from pharmaceuticals to food processing and climate science."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: Alaska Natives are indigenous peoples of Alaska, United States: Inupiat, Yupik, Aleut, Eyak, Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, and a number of Northern Athabaskan cultures. They are often defined by their language groups. Many Alaska Natives are enrolled in federally recognized Alaska Native tribal entities, who in turn belong to 13 Alaska Native Regional Corporations, who administer land and financial claims. Ancestors of the Alaska Natives are known to have migrated into the area thousands of years ago, in at least two different waves. Context: Arriving from Siberia by ship in the mid-eighteenth century, Russians began to trade with Alaska Natives. New settlements around trading posts were started by Russians, including Russian Orthodox missionaries. These were the first to translate Christian scripture into Native languages. British and American traders generally did not reach the area until the nineteenth century, and in some cases missionaries were not active until the twentieth century. In the 21st century, the numerous congregations of Russian Orthodox Christians in Alaska are generally composed mostly of Alaska Natives. Rather than hunting the marine life, the Russians forced the Aleuts to do the work for them. As word spread of the riches in furs to be had, competition among Russian companies increased and they forced the Aleuts into slavery. Catherine the Great, who became Empress in 1763, proclaimed good will toward the Aleut and urged her subjects to treat them fairly. On some islands and parts of the Alaska Peninsula, groups of traders had been capable of relatively peaceful coexistence with the local inhabitants. Other groups could not manage the tensions. Russians took hostages, families were split up, and individuals were forced to leave their villages and settle elsewhere. The growing competition between the trading companies, merging into fewer, larger and more powerful corporations, created conflicts that aggravated the relations with the indigenous populations. Over the years, the situation became catastrophic for the natives. As the animal populations declined, the Aleuts, already too dependent on the new barter economy created by the Russian fur trade, were increasingly coerced into taking greater risks in the dangerous waters of the North Pacific to hunt for more otter. As the Shelikhov-Golikov Company and later Russian-American Company developed as a monopoly, it used skirmishes and systematic violence as a tool of colonial exploitation of the indigenous people. When the Aleut revolted and won some victories, the Russians retaliated, killing many and destroying their boats and hunting gear, leaving them no means of survival. The most devastating effects were from disease: during the first two generations (1741/1759-1781/1799 AD) of Russian contact, 80 percent of the Aleut population died from Eurasian infectious diseases. These were then endemic among the Europeans, but the Aleut had no immunity against the new diseases. Question: What did they trade?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The Russians and Alaska Natives traded mostly in furs. The Alaska Natives, specifically the Aleuts, were skilled at hunting animals like sea otters for their valuable fur. The Russians wanted these furs to sell them and make money.

Context: “Please remember me to myself!” When sliding toward mania in 2016, I begged this of my therapist. He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie. Cheery. Professional as always.” I let her reassurance placate me. Wanted to be placated. Yet, within months I lost my job. And not only that, but a chance at a scholarship, two really important long term friendships—relationships I'd enjoyed since high school. I was hospitalized three times between September and February. I lost my ability to trust myself, lost my mind. It is now a little over two years since I first felt that sliding. Twenty-six months since I knew that somewhere in the deepest parts of who I am, I was slipping. Nine seasons since I begged Dr. Poe, “Remember me to myself!” I'm still recuperating. Yes.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A business model is an \\"abstract representation of an organization, be it conceptual, textual, and/or graphical, of all core interrelated architectural, co-operational, and financial arrangements designed and developed by an organization presently and in the future, as well as all core products and/or services the organization offers, or will offer, based on these arrangements that are needed to achieve its strategic goals and objectives.\\" This definition by Al-Debei, El-Haddadeh and Avison (2008) indicates that value proposition, value architecture (the organizational infrastructure and technological architecture that allows the movement of products, services, and information), value finance (modeling information related to total cost of ownership, pricing methods, and revenue structure), and value network articulate the primary constructs or dimensions of business models. - A fighting game is a video game genre in which the player controls an on-screen character and engages in close combat with an opponent, which can be either an AI or controlled by another player. The fight matches typically consist of several rounds and take place in an arena, while each character has widely differing abilities but each is relatively viable to choose. Players must master techniques such as blocking, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into \\"combos\\". Since the early 1990s, most fighting games allow the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations. The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups, which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player. - The action game is a video game genre that emphasizes physical challenges, including handeye coordination and reaction-time. The genre includes diverse subgenres such as fighting games, shooter games and platform games which are widely considered the most important action games, though some real-time strategy games are also considered to be action games. - The Astyanax , known in Japan as The Lord of King ( ) , is a side - scrolling action game developed by Aicom released for the arcades by Jaleco . A home version for the Nintendo Entertainment System , simply titled Astyanax , was released during the same time as the arcade version . - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre. - Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over 85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - Aicom was a Japanese video game developer, founded in 1988, possibly by a group that left Irem and Jaleco. Despite evidence to support this, the Sammy corporate website lists 1990 as the first year and that it was a subsidiary. It was bought by Sega Sammy Holdings in 1992. - Shooter games are a subgenre of action game, which often test the player's speed and reaction time. It includes many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar using some sort of weapon. Usually this weapon is a gun, or some other long-range weapon. A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition. Most commonly, the purpose of a shooter game is to shoot opponents and proceed through missions without the player character being killed or dying. A shooting game is a genre of video game where the player has limited spatial control of his or her character, and the focus is almost entirely on the defeat of the character's enemies using long-range weaponry. - The Sega Sammy logo is a design based on the letter S, the initial letter of both companies names. The synergy generated by the integration of the two companies are represented by a combination of blue and green, which are the companies corporate colors. Furthermore, In the logo, a curved line that suggests the horizon linking the words Sega and Sammy symbolizes the companies collaboration, and the Sega Sammy Groups determination to develop globally. - The Nintendo Entertainment System (commonly abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo. The best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute titles for Nintendo's platform. - The full name of the company that currently uses the brand is Irem Software Engineering. It was founded in 1997 by its parent company Nanao for the purpose of taking over the development department of the original Irem Corporation that had left the video game industry in 1994 to concentrate itself on the rental and sales of coin-op electronics. Irem Corporation was founded in 1974 as IPM Co Ltd and still exists today under the name Apies. - The original Jaleco Ltd was founded in 1974. In 2006, it decided to become a pure holding company by renaming itself Jaleco Holding and splitting its video game operations into a newly created subsidiary that took its former name of Jaleco Ltd. In 2009, Jaleco Holding sold Jaleco Ltd to Game Yarou and subsequently changed its own name to Emcom Holdings. - Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games where the game does not progress incrementally in turns. - A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development the process and related disciplines of creating video games.

Movie title: Night at the Museum Context: Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) is a divorced man who has been unable to keep a stable job and has failed at many business ventures. His ex-wife (Kim Raver) believes that he is a bad example to their ten-year-old son Nick (Jake Cherry), and Larry fears that Nick respects his future stepfather, bond trader Don (Paul Rudd), more than him. Cecil Fredricks (Dick Van Dyke), an elderly night security guard about to retire from the American Museum of Natural History, hires Larry despite his unpromising rÃ©sumÃ©. The museum, which is rapidly losing money, plans to replace Cecil and two colleagues Gus (Mickey Rooney) and Reginald (Bill Cobbs) with one guard. Cecil gives Larry an instruction booklet on how to handle museum security, and advises Larry to leave some of the lights on and warn him not to let anything \\"in...or out\\". Once night falls, Larry discovers that the exhibits come to life, including a living Tyrannosaurus skeleton nicknamed \\"Rexy\\" who behaves like a dog; a mischievous capuchin monkey named Dexter (Crystal) which steals Larry's keys and tears up his instruction booklet; rival miniature civilizations led by Old West cowboy Jedediah (Owen Wilson) and Roman general Octavius (Steve Coogan); limb-ripping Attila the Hun; an Easter Island Moai (Brad Garrett) obsessed with \\"gum-gum\\" who addresses Larry as Dum-Dum; and a wax model of Theodore Roosevelt (Robin Williams). Roosevelt explains that since an Egyptian artifactâthe Golden Tablet of Pharaoh Akhmenrahâcame to the museum in 1952, all of the exhibits come to life each night. If the exhibits are outside the museum during sunrise, however, they turn to dust. Roosevelt helps Larry by restoring order, but only for one night, and Larry decides to remain as a night guard.

Fans of the children’s television show “SpongeBob SquarePants” are calling on Super Bowl organizers to have the song “Sweet Victory” sung during the game’s halftime show. The petition, which had garnered more than 31,000 signatures on Change.org as of Friday, comes in the wake of show creator Stephen Hillenburg death's earlier this week after a battle with ALS. “As some of you may or may not know, Stephen Hillenburg—the creator of Spongebob Sqaurepants—has passed away recently,” the petition read. “As a tribute to his legacy, his contributions to a generation of children, and to truly showcase the greatness of this song, we call for Sweet Victory to be performed at the Halftime Show.” SpongeBob’s rendition of “Sweet Victory” was performed on the episode “Band Geeks,” which aired in the show’s second season in 2001. The cartoon sponge and his bandmates sang it at halftime of the fictional bubble bowl. David Glen Eisley, who originally sang the song, voiced SpongeBob during the musical performance. The Super Bowl will take place on Feb. 3 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. Maroon 5 is reportedly slated to be in the halftime show. Fox News’ Sasha Savitsky and Tyler McCarthy contributed to this report. ||||| Screenshot via Nick.com On Monday, marine biologist-turned-SpongeBob Squarepants creator Stephen Hillenburg died at 57. Hillenburg's iconic cartoon about a porous yellow rectangle brought some light and optimism to our dark world, and even taught at least one kid how to do the Heimlich maneuver. So in honor of his passing, one brilliant fan hatched a plan to celebrate Hillenburg in the best way he knew how: by getting the song from that episode where Spongebob plays a halftime show into the actual 2019 Super Bowl. The fan, Isreal Colunga, hopped on Change.org and launched a petition calling for \\"Sweet Victory\\" to be featured in the upcoming halftime show \\"as a tribute to [Hillenburg's] legacy, his contributions to a generation of children, and to truly showcase the greatness of this song.\\" Apparently, the world agreed—the petition has already pulled in more than 50,000 signatures since it launched on Tuesday, and it's still climbing. For those pitiful few who don't know the entire SpongeBob oeuvre by heart, the song comes from an episode called \\"Band Geeks,\\" in which SpongeBob and the gang venture up onto dry land to perform during halftime at the Bubble Bowl. \\"Sweet Victory\\" is a truly ripping 80s power ballad, like something Foreigner might've written in their heyday if they woke up one morning magically transformed into cartoon sea creatures, and by God, it is exactly the thing the Super Bowl halftime show needs. \\"It's a hugely inspirational song that I listen to when working out and boosting confidence, but besides that I want it played at the Super Bowl to honor the man who gave us one of the greatest and most quotable cartoons of all time,\\" a petition supporter named Jonathan Hersey said. \\"I need it,\\" another wrote simply. The version of \\"Sweet Victory\\" that aired in SpongeBob was performed by a guy named David Glen Eisley. Unfortunately, Eisley probably won't be playing the halftime show no matter how many signatures this petition gets, since Maroon 5 is already set to perform. But given that halftime shows historically just feature bands playing medleys of their most popular songs, along with the fact that Maroon 5 has never written anything that reaches the epic heights of \\"Sweet Victory\\" over the course of the band's entire career, maybe the petition will inspire Adam Levine to belt out a few lines of the song in Hillenburg's honor. At least 50,000 people out there know it's the right thing to do. Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.

Mount Everest, Nepal: The highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest is a challenging climb with extreme weather conditions and altitude-related dangers, such as avalanches and frostbite. Over 300 people have died attempting to conquer its summit. b. Death Valley, USA: This desert valley in California is infamous for its extreme heat, which can reach up to 130°F (54°C). Dehydration, heatstroke, and other heat-related risks make this area dangerous for unprepared travelers. c. New Smyrna Beach, Florida: Despite its picturesque beauty, the waters off this Floridian beach have the highest number of shark attacks worldwide, earning it the nickname \\"Shark Attack Capital of the World.\\" d. Acapulco, Mexico: A popular beach city known for its vibrant nightlife, Acapulco has made headlines in recent years for high crime rates, including violent crimes that pose risks to tourists. e. Snake Island, Brazil: Officially named Ilha da Queimada Grande, this island off the coast of Brazil is home to an estimated 4,000 venomous golden lancehead pit vipers. The island is off-limits to visitors due to the high risk of snake bites. f. Danakil Desert, Ethiopia: With its blazing temperatures, volcanic activity, and toxic gases, this inhospitable region offers a beautiful but treacherous landscape to intrepid visitors. 2. Which countries are most unexplored tourist destinations? Unexplored tourist destinations are often those that have remained relatively untouched by mass tourism, offering travelers the opportunity to experience something unique. Here are some of the most unexplored tourist destinations: a. Bhutan: Nestled between China and India, this small, predominantly Buddhist country has preserved its cultural heritage and pristine landscapes by limiting the number of tourists and imposing daily fees for visitors. b. Turkmenistan: Central Asia's enigmatic destination remains mostly unexplored, with highlights like the white marble city of Ashgabat, the Darvaza Gas Crater (The Door to Hell), and ancient ruins of Merv. c. Papua New Guinea: With limited infrastructure and facilities, this island nation in the Pacific Ocean boasts an incredible variety of landscapes and cultures, from dense rainforests to remote highland tribes. d. São Tomé and Príncipe: These tropical islands off the west coast of Africa offer an experience of pristine beaches, lush forests, and unique wildlife, including marine turtle nesting sites and endemic bird species. e. Belarus: Rising as an offbeat European destination, Belarus showcases striking architecture from the Soviet era, vast national parks, and a fascinating cultural dynamic between traditional and modern influences. To summarize, the first question focuses on the most dangerous places that attract tourists due to their adventurous nature or unique features. In contrast, the second question addresses lesser-known, unexplored destinations that haven't been impacted by mass tourism and provide an exclusive, uncharted experience. These two questions are not paraphrases of each other since they explore different aspects of tourist destinations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Former Division I collegiate wrestler Scott Voss is a 42-year-old bored and disillusioned biology teacher at the failing Wilkinson High School. Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty Streb, being laid off. Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Scott attempts to raise the 48,000 necessary to keep the music program alive. He moonlights as a night instructor for an adult citizenship class, where student Niko asks him for outside tutoring. When Scott arrives at Niko's apartment, he learns that Niko was a former mixed martial arts fighter. While watching the UFC at Niko's apartment, Scott learns that the loser of a fight receives 10,000, which gives him the idea of raising the money by fighting and losing in MMA. Scott, helped by Niko and Marty, begins with small unsanctioned bouts paying only 750 to the loser. Niko begins training him in defense, later adding trainer Mark to teach offense, after Scott knocks out an opponent and realizes that wins give larger payouts, needing fewer fights to achieve his 48,000 goal. While Mark trains with Scott, Malia De La Cruz, one of Scott's students and a band member, helps Niko study for his citizenship test by putting the information into songs. Scott then begins fighting in small MMA fights and gradually gaining higher amounts of money for the school.

When she got home she put one bag of ice in the sink and another in the freezer, but then was distracted by a phone call and forgot to put the other bag in the freezer. When she returned, the bag of ice had melted. Was the temperature of the melted bag higher or lower than the temperature of the frozen bag? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The temperature of the melted bag would be higher than the temperature of the frozen bag. When Susan left the bag of ice out, the ice began to melt due to the room temperature being higher than the freezing point of water (0°C or 32°F). As the ice absorbed heat energy from the surrounding environment, it gradually changed from a solid to a liquid state. This process of melting increased the temperature of the ice to reach the room temperature. On the other hand, the bag of ice placed in the freezer remains at a lower temperature, which is below 0°C or 32°F, since the freezer's purpose is to maintain temperatures at or below the freezing point to prevent food from spoiling and to keep frozen items in their solid state.

It was written in 1908 by Jack Norworth and composed by Albert Von Tilzer, both of whom were prolific Tin Pan Alley songwriters of their time. Jack Norworth, whose full name is John Godfrey Knauff, was an American songwriter, lyricist, and performer. Born in Philadelphia on January 5, 1879, he is best known for writing the lyrics to \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\" and several other hit songs. Despite penning the lyrics to a song about baseball, it is interesting to note that Norworth had never actually attended a professional baseball game until more than 30 years after the song was written, in 1940. Albert Von Tilzer, born Albert Gumm on March 29, 1878, in Indianapolis, was the brother of another successful Tin Pan Alley composer, Harry Von Tilzer. Albert adopted the \\"Von Tilzer\\" moniker as a stage name, implying a noble European origin. Throughout his career, he wrote and composed music for numerous popular songs. In addition to collaborating with Jack Norworth on \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game,\\" his other famous works include \\"Put Your Arms Around Me, Honey\\" and \\"I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time.\\" \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\" quickly gained popularity after its original publication and is now firmly entrenched in American baseball culture.

Kronos and his companion, the hunchback Hieronymus Grost, are professional vampire hunters. Grost explains to the initially sceptical Marcus that the dead women are victims of a vampire who drains not blood but youth, and that there are \\"as many species of vampire as there are beasts of prey.\\" The discovery of another victim confirms Grost's explanation. Along the way, Kronos and Grost take in a local barefoot girl, Carla, who had been sentenced to the stocks for dancing on the Sabbath. She repays them by helping them hunt the vampire; she later becomes Kronos' lover. Grost and Kronos conduct a mystical test that indicates the presence of vampires. Their findings are contradicted by an eyewitness who claims to have seen \\"someone old, very old\\", whereas a youth-draining vampire should appear youthful. Marcus visits the family of his late friend, Lord Hagen Durward, and speaks with Durward's son, Paul (Shane Briant), and his beautiful sister Sara (Lois Daine). He must leave before speaking with the bed-ridden Lady Durward. While riding through the woods, Marcus encounters a cloaked figure that leaves him shaken, and he finds blood on his lips.

Context: The amazing December turnaround of the Philadelphia Eagles continued with another road win over a division rival. Philadelphia's surprising 23-7 Christmas Day victory over the Dallas Cowboys was broadcast on national television and clinched a playoff spot. Jeff Garcia, who outshined fellow backup-turned starting quarterback Tony Romo, led the Eagles to scores on four of their first five possessions. Capping off their first drive, which took 7:12 off the clock, Garcia hit tight end Matt Schobel for a 25-yard touchdown. Cowboys' return man Miles Austin fumbled the ensuing kickoff to Quintin Mikell. However, Dallas cornerback Anthony Henry intercepted Garcia and the Cowboys drove to the Eagles' 1-yard line. From there, the Philadelphia defense stuffed Dallas goal-line back Marion Barber III on three straight plays. The ball turned over on downs and Garcia promptly found Dont&#233; Stallworth for a 39-yard gain. The drive finished with a David Akers field goal and the Eagles led 10-0. Romo and the Cowboys responded with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens, who only caught two passes for 23 yards on the game. With only&#160;:29 seconds left in the half, Garcia got the Eagles into field goal range, and David Akers connected on a 45-yarder to make it 13-7 as time expired. On the opening drive of the third quarter, Garcia beat a Dallas blitz and completed a 65-yard catch and run to L.J. Smith. Philadelphia finished the drive with another field goal and it was 16-7. Early in the fourth quarter, Brian Dawkins made an over the shoulder interception in front of Owens in the end zone. On a 6:57 drive that included ten running plays and broke the Cowboys' backs, Correll Buckhalter pounded it in from one yard out, increasing the lead to 23-7. Romo would throw another interception, this one to Lito Sheppard, and the Eagles' domination of the Dallas offense continued for the rest of the game. The Eagles ran the ball a whopping 42 times for 204 yards (with Brian Westbrook accounting for 122 of those yards), while Garcia and the passing game gained 238 yards. The defense recorded three sacks in addition to the two interceptions and held Dallas to a meager 201 total yards on their own turf. Philadelphia clinches a playoff berth, and now suddenly controls the NFC East and can win the division with a win over the Atlanta Falcons or a Dallas loss. With another victory, the Eagles moved up to 9-6. Question: How many total points were scored in the first half? Answer:","completion":"In the first half, a total of 20 points were scored.

The news comes as Plymouth Hospitals Trust in Devon confirmed it has been on the alert - the highest level the NHS has - since early January. Yeovil Hospital in Somerset is also now on the alert, while hospitals in Exeter and Dorset are under pressure. The alert indicates a hospital has officially confirmed its services are overwhelmed by demand. Extension of it comes after the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust confirmed it was on the alert status, last Tuesday. The last time hospitals were this busy was six years ago, NHS England says. Almost all hospitals in the region have seen sharp increases in patients and they're finding it increasingly difficult to cope. Derriford now admits that, since the start of the year, it has been in \\"critical internal incident mode\\", jargon for the highest level of escalation - or a state of \\"black.\\" The majority of emergency admissions are older people with respiratory problems. One exacerbating factor may be that this season's flu vaccine is largely ineffective against the strain of the virus currently in circulation. Austerity has also taken its toll. Despite a cash injection to help manage \\"winter pressures\\", years of flat incomes have dented hospitals' resilience, while spending cuts by hard-pressed councils mean less money for the care packages needed to allow frailer patients to be sent home after treatment. A spokesman for Plymouth Hospitals Trust said: \\"Since the end of December, we have faced unprecedented and sustained demand on our emergency and medical services, which has impacted right across the hospital.\\" The spokesman said the hospital had been in \\"critical internal incident mode\\" since early January, which is nationally recognised as a \\"black alert\\". Torbay and the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital has been on red alert for the past week and Dorset County Hospital has announced a red alert - one level below black. Kevin Baber, chief operating officer at Plymouth Hospitals Trust, said \\"a number of operations\\" had been cancelled. In a statement on the trust's website, he said: \\"As more patients are admitted from the emergencyâ€ˆdepartment onto wards, beds get taken up. \\"This means we don't have beds available for those patients coming in for planned operations, with a particular lack of critical care beds, and therefore we have to cancel their surgery.\\" Ben Bradshaw, Labour MP for Exeter and former health minister, said he was told the volume of patients being admitted to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital had led to the cancellation of all operations on one day. He said: \\"This is very worrying and it shows the unprecedented pressure that our hospitals and our A&E departments in particular, are under.\\" At the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, which covers St Michael's in Hayle, West Cornwall Hospital in Penzance and The Royal Cornwall at Treliske, 280 beds have been blocked so far by people who were fit to leave but had no care package in place.

Relationship: The first sentence merely states that it is an \\"older woman\\" cleaning the window, while the second sentence introduces the term \\"grandmother.\\" There is no information provided about the older woman's family ties or relationship, so it is not possible to verify whether she is a grandmother or not based on the given information. 2.

Write an article based on this summary: Let yourself grieve. Embrace your independence. Detach yourself. Turn on the water works. Exercise regularly. Surround yourself with people who love, care for, and understand you.","completion":"Title: Navigating the Journey of Emotional Healing: Steps to Embrace Your Independence and Detach with Grace Introduction The journey to emotional healing is undeniably a challenging yet vital aspect of personal growth, as it allows us to release pent-up emotions, regain a sense of control over our lives, and move forward with newfound wisdom and strength. One key factor in successful emotional healing is the ability to embrace our independence and detach ourselves from the sources of our pain, which can be achieved through a series of actionable and empowering coping strategies. In this article, we will discuss the importance of letting yourself grieve, turning on the water works, exercising regularly, and surrounding yourself with people who love, care for, and understand you. 1. Let Yourself Grieve Acknowledging the loss or change that has affected your emotional well-being is the first essential step in the healing process. It is crucial to allow yourself to experience the pain and sadness that come with grieving as bottling up these emotions will only prolong your suffering. While it may be tempting to put on a brave face and suppress the emotions, opening up to them and experiencing them fully enables you to start healing. 2. Embrace Your Independence As you begin to heal emotionally, embracing your independence becomes increasingly crucial in achieving long-term mental and emotional stability. Nurturing your own self-reliance and inner strength during this time allows you to explore your unique passions, interests, and values while fostering a renewed sense of self-worth and self-confidence. Engaging in activities and hobbies that bring joy and satisfaction is an essential aspect of establishing a healthy sense of independence. 3. Detach Yourself Detaching yourself from the source of your emotional pain is not only necessary but also a liberating experience since it enables you to break free from negative influences and situations that could potentially hinder your healing process. Keep in mind that detachment is not synonymous with avoidance or indifference, but rather an acknowledgement that you need to prioritize your own well-being. Establishing firm boundaries, setting rational expectations, and practicing self-compassion are invaluable tools that will help you in the process of detachment. 4. Turn on the Water Works Crying is a natural and effective way to release bottled up emotions and process your feelings. Turning on the water works during your emotional healing journey can be extremely therapeutic and beneficial in gaining relief from overwhelming feelings. Remember that showing vulnerability is not a sign of weakness, but an act of courage that allows you to unburden yourself and emerge stronger than before. 5. Exercise Regularly Physical activity plays a crucial role in promoting overall mental and emotional well-being. Engaging in regular exercise not only enhances your mood and reduces stress, but also improves your self-esteem and fosters feelings of personal accomplishment and resilience. Whether you prefer walking, running, yoga, or team sports, incorporating an activity that you enjoy into your daily routine can be a game-changer in your journey toward emotional healing. 6. Surround Yourself with People Who Love, Care for, and Understand You The presence of a strong, loving, and supportive social network is an invaluable asset as you traverse the emotional healing process. Connecting with friends and relatives who genuinely empathize with your situation can help to alleviate feelings of isolation and loneliness that often accompany grief or loss. Likewise, participating in group therapy or joining a support group can also provide additional resources and encouragement as you work through your emotions and strive for personal growth. Conclusion Emotional healing is a dynamic and deeply personal process that necessitates time, patience, and commitment. By learning to let yourself grieve, embracing your independence, detaching yourself from sources of pain, turning on the water works, exercising regularly, and surrounding yourself with supportive people, you can successfully navigate the challenging terrain of emotional healing while ultimately opening the door to a brighter, more fulfilling future."},{"prompt":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a passage which has a question and the context. You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context. Input: Context: Characteristic clinical heterogeneity and mostly slow-growing behavior of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) cause problems in finding appropriate treatments. Thus, current therapy options are not satisfactory. PKI-587 is a highly potent novel dual inhibitor of PI3K and mTORC1/C2.', 'We assessed the effects of PKI-587 in different GEP-NEN tumor models, including poorly differentiated cell line LCC-18, compared with the established mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus.', 'We treated the cell lines BON, QGP1, KRJ-I and LCC-18 with increasing concentrations of the inhibitor PKI-587, and compared with everolimus and DMSO. We assessed the impact of treatments on viability (WST-1 assay), on apoptotic processes (Caspase 3/7 assay, JC-1) and on cell cycle regulation (flow cytometry). We determined alterations of signaling mediators by phosphor-specific western blot analysis and conducted multiplexed gene expression analysis (nCounter® technology).', 'In all cell lines, PKI-587 dose-dependently inhibited proliferation whereas everolimus was less effective. Treatment with PKI-587 led to cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and successfully suppressed activity of direct mTORC1 target 4E-BP1, a crucial factor for tumor genesis only partially inhibited by everolimus. Gene expression analyses revealed relevant changes of RAS, MAPK, STAT and PI3K pathway genes after treatment. Treatment dependent and cell line characteristic effects on AKT/RB/E2F signaling regarding cell cycle control and apoptosis are extensively discussed in this article.Question: Is inhibition of mTORs Catalytic Site by PKI-587 a Promising Therapeutic Option for Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor Disease?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. Now, I have a new situation: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries. Answer this question please: Which country would have lower labor supply in response to their taxation? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, the Laffer curve suggests that a below-critical tax rate should lead to higher labour supply, while an above-critical tax rate should lead to a lower labour supply due to the decline in labour supply as a consequence of higher taxation. Considering post-World War II policies in Germany and France, it can be inferred that West Germany mostly elected pro-capitalist governments that implemented tax rates below the critical rate. In contrast, France's pro-socialist governments implemented tax rates above the critical rate. Informed businesses operating in these countries had to take into account the differences in tax policies when making decisions. Since the Laffer curve suggests that higher tax rates above the critical rate lead to lower labour supply, it is predicted that in this scenario, France would have a lower labour supply as a response to their relatively higher taxation policies compared to Germany. Conversely, Germany, with its more pro-capitalist approach and lower tax rates, is expected to have a higher labour supply. However, it is essential to note that numerous factors impact labour supply, and taxation is just one of these contributing elements. In reality, the situation could differ due to the influence of other socio-economic and political factors in these countries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg has 'lost focus' in third term, say more than half of New Yorkers BY Jonathan Lemire DAILY NEWS CITY HALL BUREAU CHIEF Originally Published:Wednesday, October 19th 2011, 9:52 AM Updated: Wednesday, October 19th 2011, 11:55 AM More than half of New Yorkers believe Mayor Bloomberg has \\"lost focus\\" during his controversial third term, a new poll released Wednesday found. Though more people than not - 47% to 42% - still approve of Bloomberg's job as mayor, 52% of New Yorkers believe the billionaire has lost his way during the autumn of his administration. \\"The job-approval bounce Mayor Michael Bloomberg got from his handling of Tropical Storm Irene has faded,\\" said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. \\"He's back in the third-term blahs and slightly more than half of the neighbors think Hizzoner has lost focus,\\" said Carroll. Bloomberg's widely praised handling of the August storm briefly resuscitated his popularity, sending his job approval rating soaring to 54%, the highest it had been in months. That jolt had faded among the 1,000 voters surveyed last week for the poll. Carroll attributed the decline due to a series of third-term disappointments, including the CityTime scandal and the disastrous appointments of former Schools Chancellor Cathie Black and former Deputy Mayor of Operations Stephen Goldsmith. Those voters had not just soured on Bloomberg, but also on some of those who are seeking his job. The disapproval ratings for City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio and Controller John Liu all jumped from Quinnipiac's last poll two months ago. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly also had his disapproval rating rise - from 17% to 24% - but the voters still say the city's top cop is their choice to replace Bloomberg in two years. Kelly's personal standing remains unchanged even in light of the high-profile clashes between cops and Occupy Wall Street protesters - and the ongoing NYPD ticket-fixing scandal. Kelly was the pick of 25% of those polled - even though the police commissioner has never indicated he will run for mayor. Quinn was the next highest choice, being named by 22% of voters if Kelly is removed from the candidates. City voters' dissatisfaction with elected officials spread to Washington, as President Obama saw his approval rating dip to 62% - the lowest since he took office. The majority of those polled - 58% - believe that Obama is a strong supporter of Israel, a hot-button issue that became part of the recent special election to fill the seat of former Rep. Anthony Weiner.

The man is the one who implies something, while his friend is the one seeking clarification. Step 3: Write the opening statements of the conversation The conversation can begin with the man casually mentioning something about his professor's opinion on the job to his friend. This sets the context and allows the friend to ask further questions. Man: So, my professor recommended this job to me, saying it would be a great opportunity to advance my career. Step 4: Develop questions from the friend to dig deeper The friend might show genuine curiosity and ask questions to understand why the man believes his professor was wrong about the job. Friend: Oh, really? Did it turn out to be as good as your professor said it would be? Step 5: Have the man imply his professor's mistake The man can now reveal his true opinion about his professor's recommendation without directly stating that the professor is mistaken.

Answer this question: what are the names of pluto's moons??","completion":"Pluto, which is a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, has a total of five known moons. They are as follows: 1. Charon: Discovered in 1978, Charon is the largest and most massive of Pluto's moons. It was named after the ferryman of the dead in Greek mythology. With a diameter of about 1,214 kilometers (754 miles), Charon is roughly half the size of Pluto, and the two bodies are often referred to as a binary system due to their close relationship. Charon and Pluto are tidally locked, meaning they both always present the same face to each other. 2. Nix: This moon was discovered in 2005, along with Hydra, by astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope. Nix is an elongated, irregularly shaped moon that is approximately 54 kilometers (34 miles) in diameter. Named after the Greek goddess of darkness and chaos, Nix orbits Pluto at a distance of roughly 48,700 kilometers (30,250 miles). 3. Hydra: Also discovered in 2005, Hydra is the outermost moon orbiting Pluto and is roughly 65 kilometers (40 miles) across. The moon's elongated and irregular shape suggests it may have been formed by merging smaller satellites. Hydra was named after the nine-headed serpent in Greek mythology that guarded the entrance to the Underworld. It orbits Pluto at a distance of approximately 64,700 kilometers (40,200 miles). 4. Kerberos: This small moon was discovered in 2011 by a group of scientists utilizing the Hubble Space Telescope. With an estimated diameter of 19 kilometers (12 miles), Kerberos is one of the smallest moons in Pluto's system. It's named after the mythological three-headed dog that guards the entrance to the Underworld in Greek mythology. Kerberos orbits at a distance of around 57,700 kilometers (35,850 miles) from Pluto. 5. Styx: Discovered in 2012, Styx is the smallest and second-closest moon to Pluto. It has an estimated diameter of around 13 kilometers (8 miles) and is believed to be elongated and irregular in shape. Styx was named after the river that ancient Greeks believed separated the world of the living from the world of the dead, which was guarded by the aforementioned Charon. It orbits Pluto at a distance of approximately 42,600 kilometers (26,500 miles). These five moons orbit Pluto in a nearly coplanar arrangement, tilted just slightly with respect to the dwarf planet's equator. All of them are believed to have been formed from a giant impact that created the Pluto-Charon binary system. The debris from this impact eventually coalesced into the smaller moons now orbiting Pluto."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

With a finishing time of 38:29.7 minutes, Cologna won the gold medal with an impressively large margin of victory. This was an awe-inspiring achievement on the world’s biggest platform for winter sports, especially considering that Cologna had undergone ankle surgery just a few months prior to these Games. This wasn’t the Swiss athlete's first Olympic triumph. He had previously clinched the gold at the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games in the men's Individual 15 km (Free) event. Cologna's victory in Sochi cemented his status as one of the leading athletes in the sport of cross-country skiing. His performance at Sochi further highlighted his skills, stamina, and strategic advantage in managing the treacherous course, which was both physically challenging and mentally taxing. He managed to maintain a quick pace throughout the race, exhibiting remarkable discipline and steady nerves to conserve energy for the later parts of the race.

They not only know the scales, songs, and chords that you need to practice, but they can give you specific advice on how to improve your playing. Make sure you like the teacher to a fixed term. When looking for a teacher, be sure to discuss the following: Your goals in playing the piano (songs, bands, career, etc.) What genres of music you want to practice The teacher’s qualifications and experience The teacher’s cost and availability Most piano music is written on charts in musical notation, and it is rare to find a piano player who cannot read music. Purchase a book, watch videos online, get a music learning app or ask your teacher to help you learn so that you can play any music you can get your hands on. Practice reading music each day so that it becomes second nature. You can try to play pieces by sight, bring charts with you on the bus, play songs frequently or play musical games online. Music is built on a set of rules and relationships between notes, and knowing music theory allows you to see the patterns in your favorite songs and learn them more quickly. You can always take a course, but there are also a variety of books and online tutorials meant to teach people music theory, from the basics to complex arrangements. Available at every music store, these books are relatively cheap glossaries of every piano chord you could play. They are usually grouped together by note, but frequently they come with sections detailing which chords sound good together and the right scale to play for each note.","completion":"The fastest way to learn piano is usually with a teacher who can provide specific guidance, tailored to your goals and preferred genres.

Follow these steps: Step 1: Consider the original equation: 15*q + 20 = 5*q Step 2: To isolate the 'q' terms on one side of the equation, we need to subtract '5q' from both sides: 15*q - 5*q + 20 = 5*q - 5*q Step 3: Simplify both sides of the equation by combining like terms: (15 - 5)*q + 20 = 0 10*q + 20 = 0 Step 4: Now, to isolate 'q' further, we need to move the constant to the other side. Subtract '20' from both sides of the equation: 10*q + 20 - 20 = 0 - 20 10*q = -20 Step 5: Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 10 to solve for 'q': 10*q / 10 = -20 / 10 q = -2 So the value of 'q' that satisfies the equation 15*q + 20 = 5*q is q = -2."},{"prompt":"Definition: Given two entities as input, classify as \\"yes\\" if second entity is the part of the first entity.

Summarize this article: New ways in which Facebook might have played a role in 2016 election meddling continue to emerge. Yesterday (March 16), the company announced the suspension of data analytics company Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) and its prominent parent political firm Cambridge Analytica—three years after it illegally used the data of up to 50 million users. According to a note shared by the company, in 2015 Facebook found out that, despite telling its users otherwise, Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan passed user data collected through personality testing app “thisisyourdigitallife” (which touted itself as a personality test used by psychologists) to the political firm Cambridge Analytica—a company owned by Robert Mercer and led by Steve Bannon at the time—and to Christopher Wylie, from a digital service company called Eunoia Technologies. The 270,000 people who downloaded the app allowed it access not only to their data, but some of their friends’—depending on their settings. However, they did not authorize that their data be shared with other companies, a behavior that is in violation of Facebook platform policies. The revelation comes from reporting by The Observer. According to Wylie, a whistleblower who detailed the illegal data use, saying the information was used in 2014 to profile individual US voters who were then served Donald Trump ads during the election. “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons,” Wylie told The Observer, “That was the basis that the entire company was built on.” After finding out that the breach had happened, Facebook deleted the app, then requested a certification from all involved that the obtained data had been destroyed—but Facebook never followed up on it. “They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back,” Wylie said. Only last month, Cambridge Analytica’s CEO and Facebook both told the British parliament the political firm did not harvest any of the social media user data to target election ads during Brexit. The firm continues to deny the allegations: Facebook has repeatedly denied that data breaches as the one detailed occurred—and even after finding out, years after the fact, that it had, the company defends its best practices. ”We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” Facebook states in the same note that admits their “vigorous enforcement” consisted in taking the word of someone who had already broken their regulation to ensure said information was protected. Further, the note tries to put the responsibility of controlling such information on the user, but highlighting a the “ways we give people the tools to control their experience.” ||||| Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes. During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action. “This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said. Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago. In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.” In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees. ||||| The algorithm used in the Facebook data breach trawled though personal data for information on sexual orientation, race, gender – and even intelligence and childhood trauma The algorithm at the heart of the Facebook data breach sounds almost too dystopian to be real. It trawls through the most apparently trivial, throwaway postings –the “likes” users dole out as they browse the site – to gather sensitive personal information about sexual orientation, race, gender, even intelligence and childhood trauma. A few dozen “likes” can give a strong prediction of which party a user will vote for, reveal their gender and whether their partner is likely to be a man or woman, provide powerful clues about whether their parents stayed together throughout their childhood and predict their vulnerability to substance abuse. And it can do all this without an need for delving into personal messages, posts, status updates, photos or all the other information Facebook holds. Some results may sound more like the result of updated online sleuthing than sophisticated data analysis; “liking” a political campaign page is little different from pinning a poster in a window. Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach Read more But five years ago psychology researchers showed that far more complex traits could be deduced from patterns invisible to a human observer scanning through profiles. Just a few apparently random “likes” could form the basis for disturbingly complex character assessments. When users liked “curly fries” and Sephora cosmetics, this was said to give clues to intelligence; Hello Kitty likes indicated political views; “Being confused after waking up from naps” was linked to sexuality. These were just some of the unexpected but consistent correlations noted in a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal in 2013. “Few users were associated with ‘likes’ explicitly revealing their attributes. For example, less than 5% of users labelled as gay were connected with explicitly gay groups, such as No H8 Campaign,” the peer-reviewed research found. The researchers, Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell and Thore Graepel, saw the dystopian potential of the study and raised privacy concerns. At the time Facebook “likes” were public by default. “The predictability of individual attributes from digital records of behaviour may have considerable negative implications, because it can easily be applied to large numbers of people without their individual consent and without them noticing,” they said. “Commercial companies, governmental institutions, or even your Facebook friends could use software to infer attributes such as intelligence, sexual orientation or political views that an individual may not have intended to share.” To some, that may have sounded like a business opportunity. By early 2014, Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix had signed a deal with one of Kosinski’s Cambridge colleagues, lecturer Aleksandr Kogan, for a private commercial venture, separate from Kogan’s duties at the university, but echoing Kosinski’s work. Quick guide How the story unfolded Show Hide In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name. Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit. She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics. While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players. The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”. But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience. Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates. Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live. The academic had developed a Facebook app which featured a personality quiz, and Cambridge Analytica paid for people to take it, advertising on platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. The app recorded the results of each quiz, collected data from the taker’s Facebook account – and, crucially, extracted the data of their Facebook friends as well. The results were paired with each quiz-taker’s Facebook data to seek out patterns and build an algorithm to predict results for other Facebook users. Their friends’ profiles provided a testing ground for the formula and, more crucially, a resource that would make the algorithm politically valuable. Aleksandr Kogan To be eligible to take the test the user had to have a Facebook account and be a US voter, so tens of millions of the profiles could be matched to electoral rolls. From an initial trial of 1,000 “seeders”, the researchers obtained 160,000 profiles – or about 160 per person. Eventually a few hundred thousand paid test-takers would be the key to data from a vast swath of US voters. It was extremely attractive. It could also be deemed illicit, primarily because Kogan did not have permission to collect or use data for commercial purposes. His permission from Facebook to harvest profiles in large quantities was specifically restricted to academic use. And although the company at the time allowed apps to collect friend data, it was only for use in the context of Facebook itself, to encourage interaction. Selling that data on, or putting it to other purposes, – including Cambridge Analytica’s political marketing – was strictly barred. It also appears likely the project was breaking British data protection laws, which ban sale or use of personal data without consent. That includes cases where consent is given for one purpose but data is used for another. The paid test-takers signed up to T&Cs, including collection of their own data, and Facebook’s default terms allowed their friends’ data to be collected by an app, unless they had changed their privacy settings. But none of them agreed to their data possibly being used to create a political marketing tool or to it being placed in a vast campaign database. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps. Facebook denies this was a data breach. Vice-president Paul Grewal said: “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules.” The scale of the data collection Cambridge Analytica paid for was so large it triggered an automatic shutdown of the app’s ability to harvest profiles. But Kogan told a colleague he “spoke with an engineer” to get the restriction lifted and, within a day or two, work resumed. Within months, Kogan and Cambridge Analytica had a database of millions of US voters that had its own algorithm to scan them, identifying likely political persuasions and personality traits. They could then decide who to target and craft their messages that was likely to appeal to them for those individuals – a political approach known as “micro-targeting”. Facebook announced on Friday that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform pending information over misuse of data related to this project. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels”, but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information onto third parties. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Facebook is once again facing scrutiny for its potential influence on the 2016 US elections. The social media giant announced on March 16, 2018, that it had suspended data analytics company Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), later incorporated as Cambridge Analytica, for illicit use of data belonging to an estimated 50 million users. The saga began in 2015 when Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan developed the app \\"thisisyourdigitallife\\", purporting it to be a personality test used by psychologists. In violation of Facebook's policies, Kogan transferred user data gathered from the app to Cambridge Analytica, a political firm owned by Robert Mercer. It was led by Steve Bannon and had significant ties with Christopher Wylie, a former data scientist at Cambridge Analytica. Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app, inadvertently adding their own data as well as that of some of their Facebook friends (depending on permissions) to Cambridge Analytica's databank. This data was allegedly used to profile individual US voters and deliver them targeted ads during the Trump election campaign. When Facebook discovered the data breach, the app was removed. However, despite receiving certifications from the involved parties that the data had been erased, Facebook neglected to follow up. This breach allegedly took place two years before the Cambridge Analytica CEO and Facebook insisted before a British parliament hearing that none of the user's data was collected or used for targeted ad purposes during the Brexit referendum. Despite the controversy, Facebook maintains that its data breach policies are effective and robust. Facebook stated that it wrongly trusted Kogan, who acquired personal data for academic purposes and subsequently used it for his dealings with Cambridge Analytica. Today, the company asserts that control of such information essentially resides with the users. The conversation has broadened, however, to discuss a larger issue: that the infamous data breach was actually a window into a deeply dystopian reality powered by algorithms. The ability of Facebook's algorithm, which scouts for user 'likes', to predict sensitive personal information like sexual orientation, race, gender, political preferences, susceptibility to substance abuse, etc., is alarming. The research into it (by Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell, and Thore Graepel) was published in 2013, clearly highlighting the risks to privacy. In the realm of politics, an algorithm that can predict user behavior on such granular levels is extremely attractive. Aleksandr Kogan used this algorithm in a political marketing tool used for 'micro-targeting' potential voters, a tactic considered illegal. Despite the massive scale of this data harvesting operation, Kogan insists he followed all legal protocols and worked closely with Facebook, which granted him the requisite permissions for his apps. However, Facebook emphasizes that although Kogan had obtained the data legally, sharing it with third parties was a breach of regulation. Current investigations are still underway into these allegations against Cambridge Analytica. At present, Facebook maintains the information wasn't breached but was obtained improperly by external parties."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What was the number of the locomotive that was leased to Cadillac and Lake City Railroad in Michigan? Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1979, the locomotive was renumbered \\"1881\\", painted black with silver stripes, and leased to a Hollywood company for use in the filming of the horror movie Terror Train (1979), starring Jamie Lee Curtis. In 1980, the locomotive was repainted with a color scheme used by Canadian Pacific in the 1930s. The black, gold, and Tuscan red paint job was popular with railroad enthusiasts and photographers. The number 1293 was also restored to the engine. In February 1982, the headlights, handrails, and cab roof of 1293 were damaged when the roof of a Steamtown storage building gave way to heavy snow.Although the Steamtown Special History Study reasoned that, since this type of locomotive had historically operated in New England, perhaps as far south as Boston, it qualified to be part of the federal government's collection, the Canadian native sat unused for 12 years following the move to Scranton. Ohio Central Railroad System purchased it in 1996, and it underwent a 13-month restoration. As of July 2010, Ohio Central Railroad has lost control of most of its holdings, but former owner, Jerry Joe Jacobson, maintained a collection of vintage equipment including CPR 1293 and her sister, CRP 1278, which is also a veteran of Steamtown, U.S.A. operational locomotives. No. 1293 is still operational as of October 2011.Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1278, like her sister, CPR 1293, was also built by Canadian Locomotive Company in 1948, and is a type 4-6-2, class G5d light-weight \\"Pacific\\" locomotive.

Blount had planned to renumber all three of the series 1200 CRP locomotives in his collection from 1246, 1278, and 1293 to 124, 127 and 129 respectively, but 1278 was the only one of the three that underwent the change. The new number remained on the locomotive from 1966 until 1973, when its former number was restored. The locomotive was leased to the Cadillac and Lake City Railroad in Michigan from 1970 to 1971.

This includes both the development of an embryo into a fetus and the development of a fetus into a baby. Any disruption in mitosis could lead to developmental issues or other health problems. However, the development of a baby from a fetus would not directly affect the mitosis process itself. This is because mitosis is a cellular-level process that takes place throughout an individual's lifetime. It is responsible for the growth and development of every organism, from the prenatal phase through postnatal growth and adulthood. In contrast, any damage or 'hurting' of the mitosis process could potentially affect the development of a baby from a fetus - for example, by causing developmental abnormalities or growth issues. But the reverse (the process of a baby developing from a fetus affecting mitosis) is not the case.

Q:Given the following context: After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a... answer the following question: What is the name of the person whose music, from the Fourth Symphony onwards, was strongly influenced by the music of Mahler?

Which of these is the most likely disadvantage that can result from this process? Select from: -decreased genetic diversity; -habitat destruction; -overpopulation; -increased erosion;","completion":"The most likely disadvantage resulting from the selective breeding process in plants for pest resistance and higher yield is decreased genetic diversity. Selective breeding involves the intentional mating of plants with specific desirable traits to produce offspring that inherit these traits. Over time, this process can result in plants that are better adapted to various conditions or have traits that are beneficial for agriculture and food production. However, as the focus is placed on enhancing specific traits, the genetic diversity within the species may decline. Decreased genetic diversity can have several negative consequences, including: 1. Reduced ability to adapt to environmental changes: With less genetic variation, the species may not possess the necessary traits to adapt to changing climatic conditions, new pathogens, or other environmental changes, making them vulnerable to extinction. 2. Increased vulnerability to pests and diseases: As the gene pool becomes more homogeneous, it becomes easier for pests and pathogens to target and affect the plants. In the case of a new pest or disease outbreak, having genetically similar plants could make the entire population more susceptible, leading to significant crop losses. 3. Negative impact on ecosystem balance: A reduction in genetic diversity can affect the overall health of ecosystems, as diverse plant populations contribute to a more balanced ecosystem. Less genetic diversity can also have negative consequences for other organisms that depend on the plants, such as pollinators and herbivores. 4. Weakened resistance to diseases and pests: While selective breeding can produce plants with improved resistance, decreased genetic diversity can lead to new issues, such as the evolution of pests and diseases that can overcome the established resistance. This can exacerbate the problem, potentially resulting in a reliance on chemical pesticides and other interventions, which can have negative environmental impacts. While the other options (habitat destruction, overpopulation, and increased erosion) can be associated with modern agricultural practices in general, they are not necessarily direct consequences of the selective breeding process itself. The most likely disadvantage directly resulting from selective breeding for pest resistance and higher yield is a decrease in genetic diversity. In order to address this issue, it is essential to implement strategies that preserve and maintain genetic diversity, such as conserving wild relatives of cultivated plants and promoting sustainable agricultural practices that support genetic variation within crops."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The research, which spanned over five years, concluded that patients experienced a reduction of 42% in their likelihood of dying from a heart attack. This substantial decrease in heart attack mortality attests to the efficacy of Zocor as a potent cholesterol-lowering drug, a factor that likely contributed to its financial success for Merck, as it made them over US1 billion in 1995, along with another drug, Mevacor. The groundbreaking research into this new class of molecules for cholesterol reduction won accolades, including the Japan Prize in 2006 and the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 2008, which were awarded to Endo.

Article:The council has been heavily criticised for its handling of the disaster on 14 June that killed at least 80 people. Both the council leader and chief executive have resigned as a result. Only 14 out of the 158 affected families have accepted offers of temporary accommodation but ministers say no-one will be forced to move. Housing minister Alok Sharma fought back tears as he told the Commons of hearing \\"harrowing accounts\\" from survivors, saying it had been the most \\"humbling and moving experience of my life\\". He said 19 families \\"have not yet been ready to engage\\" in the process of being rehoused, while others were waiting for offers of permanent tenancy and many were still in hotels. A statement from the Met Police said 250 specialist investigators were working on the operation and the last visible human remains were removed from Grenfell Tower on Monday. Met Police Commander Stuart Cundy said there had been a total of 87 recoveries but, due to the \\"catastrophic damage\\" inside, that did not mean 87 people. So far, 21 people have been formally identified and their families informed. The taskforce is to take over the housing department, as well as other council operations. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: \\"The challenge of providing that support is, and will continue to be, significant. I want to help the council meet that challenge. \\" Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, who was chosen as Kensington and Chelsea Council's new leader on Monday said: \\"The unprecedented scale of this incident makes it impossible for one organisation to cope on its own. That's why my first action as leader was to ask the Department for Communities and Local Government for help. \\"I look forward to working with their staff as we all concentrate our efforts on healing the wounds in the north of our borough and to regain the trust of a community traumatised by disaster.\\" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was not yet clear who would be on the taskforce - but a statement from DCLG said the detail would be confirmed in the \\"following few weeks\\". Eleanor Kelly, chief executive of Southwark Council and spokeswoman for the Grenfell Response Team, said the team would be \\"very welcome\\". She told BBC Radio London: \\"We can't stay in a crisis mode for an extended period of time because everybody needs to actually feel that things have gone back to a level of stability [and] a level of control.\\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said putting the taskforce in place was the \\"absolute minimum\\" the government should do, but called for external commissioners to take charge of the council until elections next year. Meanwhile, the government has said 190 buildings in England that underwent fire tests on their cladding have failed, the government. It also announced that cladding from one building had passed the test - the only sample to do so to date. The news about the taskforce comes after a tense three-hour meeting on Tuesday between survivors, Cdr Cundy and Westminster coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox. Survivors were reportedly angry as they asked for information about people who were still missing. However, they were told the \\"recovery phase\\" could last until the end of the year, as Dr Wilcox described the inside of the tower as \\"apocalyptic\\". Police also faced questions at the meeting as to why there had not been any arrests. Cdr Cundy warned it may never be possible to identify all the victims. \\"Such is the devastation caused by the fire it may be that tragically we cannot find or identify all those who lost their lives,\\" he said. Police again appealed for the public to come forward to ensure there are no \\"hidden victims\\" from the fire. The taskforce announcement came on the same day as the government-set deadline to find temporary accommodation for all those made homeless by the fire. The Grenfell Response Team says 139 formal offers of housing have been made to survivors, after the prime minister promised housing would be offered to those in need by Wednesday. Housing Minister Alok Sharma told the Commons the temporary homes were in Kensington & Chelsea or neighbouring boroughs and being offered on a rent-free basis - but no-one will be \\"forced into a home they do not want to move to\\". A spokesman for North Kensington Law Centre - which represents more than 100 Grenfell victims - said many of the offers had been unsuitable. Father-of-two Mahad Egal escaped the fire with his family from their fourth floor flat and is now staying with friends, as the hotel room he was given was \\"too small\\" for four people. He has been offered a property but it is in a different borough and is bigger than his flat in Grenfell, which he worries will lead to higher rent costs. Robert Atkinson, leader of the Labour Party at Kensington and Chelsea Council, said decisions about accommodation should be taken by survivors when they are ready - and not just to meet government deadlines. \\"I want these arrangements to be made in the timescale and at the pace at which the victims and survivors wish to make these decisions.\\" Shadow housing secretary John Healey said the government has been \\"off the pace at each stage following this terrible tragedy\\" and the latest statement on the numbers rehoused show \\"that in some ways it still is\\".

Given the question: In erosion, the higher the elevation, the farther the stream is from where it will reach base level and the more cutting it has to do. A stream going across a low plain will have to do much or little cutting? The answer is:","completion":"A stream going across a low plain will have to do little cutting. Erosion is the process by which the earth's surface is worn away by the action of natural forces such as water, wind, and ice. In the case of a stream, the force of the water flow gradually wears away the channel's bed, banks, and surrounding soil, leading to the transportation of sediment downstream. The base level of a stream is the lowest elevation to which it can erode its channel—the point at which the velocity of the water flow is no longer enough to support significant erosion. In general, this base level is considered to be at the same elevation as the body of water (such as a lake or ocean) into which the stream eventually flows. When a stream flows across a high elevation, it has a more significant vertical drop and a longer distance to travel before reaching its base level. This increased slope and elevation difference result in a faster water flow and higher erosive power, and thus, the stream has to do more cutting to reach its base level. Conversely, a stream going across a low plain has a smaller elevation difference to its base level and a relatively flat channel slope. As a result, the water flow is gentler and slower, which reduces its erosive force. In this case, the stream needs to do much less cutting to reach its base level, as it is already at or close to the elevation where erosion can no longer occur."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

About four-fifths of high school students in China have poor eyesight . And now more and more children in primary school need glasses, too. Two main reasons can cause poor eyesight: too much time spent indoors studying and too little time spent outdoors playing. Reading and writing for hours and hours, sometimes in poorly lighted rooms, causes eyesight to weaken. But students have to do this because there is so much pressure on them to succeed in school. They have less time to enjoy the sun. The sun, it turns out, is important in developing good eyesight. According to a study by Australian National University, Australian children and Chinese children have the same level of eyesight before they start school, but once they enter primary school, Chinese children only spend about an hour a day outside, while Australian children spend three to four hours each day in the sunshine. The result is that while about forty percent of Chinese primary school students need glasses, only three percent of Australian children do. And poor eyesight at a young age can have serious long term influence. As you get older, your eyesight can worsen. With all that in mind, don't you think it's time to give your eyes a break? Question: Which can cause poor eyesight according to the reading? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Spend too much time indoors studying.\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, according to the reading, one of the causes of poor eyesight is spending too much time indoors studying. The article states that around four-fifths of high school students in China have poor eyesight, and more children in primary school also need glasses. Two main reasons are mentioned for this issue: too much time spent indoors studying and too little time spent outdoors playing. Reading and writing for extended periods, sometimes in poorly lit rooms, can weaken eyesight. Students often engage in these activities due to the immense pressure they face to succeed in school, which leads to them spending less time enjoying outdoor activities and sunlight. Sunlight is crucial for developing good eyesight, as demonstrated by a comparative study between Australian and Chinese children conducted by the Australian National University. The study found that at the beginning of their primary schooling, Australian and Chinese children had the same level of eyesight. However, as they progressed in their education, a considerable difference emerged. Chinese children spent only an hour a day outside, while their Australian counterparts spent three to four hours each day in the sunshine. As a result, 40% of Chinese primary school children needed glasses, compared to just 3% of Australian children. This highlights the potential long-term impact of poor eyesight during childhood, as eyesight can continue to worsen as one gets older. In light of this information, spending too much time indoors studying is identified as a significant factor contributing to poor eyesight among Chinese students."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mary, a baby girl, suffered from colic, whereas Patricia, also a baby girl, did not, so it was quite simple to console Available choices: [+] Mary .. [+] Patricia ..","completion":"Mary. The sentence most likely ends with \\"Mary\\" because it implies that Patricia, who did not suffer from colic, was easier to console in comparison to Mary. Colic, which is known to cause severe discomfort and crying in babies, makes it more challenging to console the affected infant. So, in the given context, it is quite simple to console Mary as she is the baby girl who suffered from colic. The complete sentence would be: \\"Mary, a baby girl, suffered from colic, whereas Patricia, also a baby girl, did not, so it was quite simple to console Mary.\\" This sentence emphasizes the differences between the two baby girls – one who suffered from colic and the other who did not – and as a result, shifts focus onto their varying levels of comfort and need for consolation. While both babies may experience general discomfort or distress, the sentence indicates that Mary's condition unavoidably made it more challenging to comfort her, compared to Patricia's more manageable state in terms of being consoled and soothed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In some countries, lease agreements may be handled by the police.. (B). If the lease forbids subleasing, then you will need to get special permission from your landlord. If you need to get permission from your landlord, you will want to try to convince him or her that a sublease is a good idea.. (C). For example, a landlord might consent to a sublease if the lease involves them doing activities outside of regular commuting hours. Subleases can be made in six different situations.. (D).

Step 1: Understand the context and paragraph provided. The paragraph explains the importance of reviewing the lease agreement before subleasing an apartment. It emphasizes that the lease will state whether or not subleasing is allowed. Step 2: Analyze the available options. (A) This option refers to contacting legal authorities and involves countries and police. It doesn't follow the context of the paragraph. (B) This option talks about getting special permission from the landlord if the lease forbids subleasing. This option is relevant to the topic of subleasing. (C) This option offers a specific example about the landlord consenting in certain situations. However, it suddenly jumps to a statement about six different situations, which doesn't make sense in the context of the paragraph. (D) This option mentions writing down the agreement in the lease and subleases having provisions. This option is somewhat related to the topic of subleasing and lease provisions but is not clear enough. Step 3: Choose the best option. Based on the analysis in Step 2, the best option is (B) since it aligns with the context of the paragraph and provides a logical continuation.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

I was one of many that expected to see a glorified, Yankee-doodle dandy portrayal of a day that (as famously quoted) should live in infamy, rather than glory. How wrong I was. These guys were there, right in the middle of it, and the pictures they returned are both amazing and heartbreaking. And yet it all occurred on a chance trip to the world trade centre on September 11, 2001. Two French filmmakers were compiling a documentary about life as a NY firefighter, particularly from the perspective of a young rookie coming up through the ranks. At the beginning we see much of this footage, just to remind us that there was no thought to producing a film about terrorism. This was intended to be a film about regular people earning an honest living helping others, and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this edge. While investigating a suspect gas line (I think, my memory's a little hazy on that), we suddenly hear a plane fly overhead. The camera pans up to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing itself into one of the towers. What must the cameraman have been thinking at this time? Recognising the importance of the footage the camera stays on, and possibly realizing the same thing, the FDNY allow the camera to follow them into the building. What follows is a true view from the front-lines. We see the commitment of the FDNY, their reactions (the stunned silence after hearing the first person fall to their death is chilling) as well as the collapse of the one of the buildings from the inside, while a second camera captures the events from the outside. If it wasn't for the horrific event they were covering, the footage alone would be any young doco-maker's dream come true. Quite simply, the footage deserves to be preserved for all time. But what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer. We see firefighters charging in without hesitation, people of different races helping one another escape to wave of rubble and even the concern of the filmmakers for one another (they are brothers) as they cannot reach one another in the confusion. There are amazing sights as well as amazing human stories in this film, something Hollywood could never duplicate (even though it's trying). 9/11 isn't a film about politics. Nor is it a film about religion, nationality or even jihad for that matter. 9/11 is a film about people, and a true indication of the best and worst that we are capable of. 9/11 is quite simply one of the most important films I've ever seen, and would be the only film to be born from this event if it were up to me.

A \\"sixth sense\\" may protect drivers when they're a bit distracted behind the wheel — but not if they're texting while driving, a new study finds. Drivers in the study were able to stay in their lanes when researchers distracted the participants with challenging questions, the researchers said. This likely happens because the brain subconsciously corrects for any mistakes that are made, the researchers said. But when the drivers were asked to text while behind the wheel, they tended to drift between lanes, said the study, published today (May 12) in the journal Scientific Reports. The work was led by researchers at the University of Houston and the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, and was funded in part by the Toyota Class Action Settlement Safety Research and Education Program. [Understand the 10 Most Destructive Human Behaviors] Normally, \\"the driver's mind can wander, and his or her feelings may boil, but a sixth sense keeps a person safe, at least in terms of [avoiding] veering off course,\\" Ioannis Pavlidis, a professor of computer science at the University of Houston and the lead author of the study, said in a statement. \\"What makes texting so dangerous is that it wreaks havoc into this sixth sense,\\" Pavlidis said. A study participant sits in the high-fidelity driving simulator. Credit: Malcolm Dcosta In the study, 59 participants were asked to drive, in a driving simulator, down a challenging stretch of virtual highway under normal, nonstressful conditions. Then, the participants drove the same stretch under three different stressful conditions: cognitive stress, during which the driver was asked mathematical or analytical questions; emotional stress, during which the driver was asked \\"emotionally stirring\\" questions; and \\"sensorimotor\\" stress, \\"where the driver needs to move [his or her] eyes and one hand between the car's controls and the smartphone all the time.\\" In this study, the sensorimotor stressor was texting. The researchers measured every driver's biological stress response during each condition by looking at how much the driver was sweating around the nose. They also measured how many times the driver drifted into another lane. In all of the stressful situations, the drivers' stress levels went up, the researchers found. In addition, the increased stress levels were associated with jittery handling of the steering wheel, which could result in drivers drifting into other lanes, the study said. However, when drivers were challenged cognitively or emotionally, they were able to correct for these \\"jitters\\" and stay in their lanes, the researchers found. It was only when the drivers' hand-eye coordination was disrupted, such as while texting, that they drifted into other lanes, the study said. The \\"sixth sense,\\" or the ability of drivers to correct their driving mistakes, may come from the part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex, the researchers wrote. This part of the brain \\"is known to automatically intervene as an error corrector\\" when there is a problem, Pavlidis said. For example, if a jittery, stressed-out driver turns the steering wheel to the left, the brain responds instantaneously by steering back toward the right, he said. This ensures that the driver's steering is straight, he said. [10 Things You Didn't Know About the Brain] But this \\"sixth sense,\\" or subconscious correction, requires hand eye-coordination, the researchers said. When drivers text at the wheel, they interrupt the necessary hand-eye coordination, and the brain no longer immediately corrects the mistakes, the researchers wrote. Still, the results of the study don't give people license to let themselves get distracted while driving. The researchers noted that extreme levels of cognitive and emotional stress would lead to unsafe driving, and that the threshold for the amount of stress that could cause unsafe driving is unclear.

Originally published on Live Science. ||||| HOUSTON, May 12, 2016 - While much has been made about the dangers of texting and driving, less attention has been focused on the age-old distractions of being absent minded or upset while driving. A team of researchers from the University of Houston (UH) and the Texas A&M; Transportation Institute (TTI) focused on all three of these important factors. Led by Ioannis Pavlidis from UH and Robert Wunderlich of TTI, the research studied how drivers behave when they are absent minded, emotionally charged or engaged in texting. The work was funded, in part, by the Toyota Class Action Settlement Safety Research and Education Program.* The study looked at 59 volunteers who were asked to drive the same segment of highway four times - under 'normal conditions' of being focused on driving, while distracted with cognitively challenging questions, while distracted with emotionally charged questions and while preoccupied with texting trivialities. To avoid bias, the order of the drives was randomized. In all three interventions - absent minded, emotional and texting - the researchers found that the drivers' handling of the wheel became jittery with respect to normal driving. This jittery handling resulted in significant lane deviations and unsafe driving only in the case of texting distractions. In the case of absent-minded and emotionally charged distractions, jittery steering resulted in straighter trajectories with respect to a normal drive and safer driving. \\"A likely explanation for this paradox is the function performed by a part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC,\\" Pavlidis said. \\"ACC is known to automatically intervene as an error corrector when there is conflict. In this case, the conflict comes from the cognitive, emotional and sensorimotor, or texting, stressors. This raises the levels of physiological stress, funneling 'fight or flight' energy to the driver's arms, resulting in jittery handling of the steering wheel.\\" What happens when the brain's ACC automatically intervenes, Pavlidis said, is that it counterbalances any strong jitter to the left with an instant equally strong jitter to the right and vice versa. The end effect of this forceful action is nullification of any veering to the left or the right of the lane and, thus, very straight driving. For ACC to perform this corrective function, it needs support from the driver's eye-hand coordination loop. If this loop breaks, which it does when the driver texts, then ACC fails and the jittery handling of the steering wheel is left unchecked, resulting in a significant lane deviation and possible accident. \\"The driver's mind can wander and his or her feelings may boil, but a sixth sense keeps a person safe at least in terms of veering off course,\\" Pavlidis said. \\"What makes texting so dangerous is that it wreaks havoc into this sixth sense. Self-driving cars may bypass this and other problems, but the moral of the story is that humans have their own auto systems that work wonders, until they break.\\" Pavlidis and Wunderlich think the scientific and manufacturing community can benefit from their team's study. They posit that the question of what happens when self-driving cars experience failures needs to be asked now rather than later. Case in point, their research uncovers the mechanism that makes moderate cognitive and emotional distractions relatively safe, but only as long as the driver's natural tendency to handle multiple tasks is not overwhelmed. \\"Following up on the results of our science study, we are currently looking into the development of a car system to monitor outward driving behaviors, such as steering jitter or lane deviation, as well as the internal state of the driver that causes them,\\" Pavlidis said. \\"This system, which I call 'stressalyzer,' a play on the word breathalyzer, may serve not only as a 'black box' in car accidents, but also as a driver alert and prevention mechanism, since it will continuously sense a driver drifting to distracted mode.\\" # The findings are described in a paper titled \\"Dissecting Driver Behaviors Under Cognitive, Emotional, Sensorimotor, and Mixed Stressors,\\" appearing May 12 in Scientific Reports, an online open-access research journal from the Nature Publishing Group. Pavlidis is a computer science professor in the UH Computational Physiology Lab, and Wunderlich is director of TTI's Center for Transportation Safety.

About the Texas A&M; Transportation Institute ||||| We analyzed the association of perinasal perspiration E with steering angle ST and maximum departure on the right (X R ) and left (X L ) side of the lane based on results from a driving simulator experiment on n = 59 subjects. This reflected the association of sympathetic state with steering performance (indicative of motor reaction) and driving performance. The experiment had three parts: Introductory Sessions: We measured perinasal perspiration during a sitting session with soothing music to establish the subject’s sympathetic baseline at rest. This was followed by two simulator drives, where we also measured perinasal perspiration. The first drive familiarized subjects with the simulator (Practice Drive, or PD). The second drive intended to relax subjects (Relaxing Drive, or RD) by having them operate the vehicle in a simple environment. Loaded Drives: We measured perinasal perspiration, steering angle, and maximum right-side/left-side lane departures on four drives (order randomized) repeated on the same highway segment under similar ambient conditions; they featured a modicum of driving difficulty (Loaded Drives, or LD j , where j denotes the type of stressor). One loaded drive had no additional stressor (LD ∅ , j = ∅). Each of the remaining three loaded drives was characterized by a different stressor j: Loaded Drive with Cognitive Stressor (LD C , j = C); Loaded Drive with Emotional Stressor (LD E , j = E); Loaded Drive with Sensorimotor Stressor (LD M , j = M). The specific stressor j was applied twice during the corresponding drive LD j . The presence or absence of the specific stressor divided the LD j drives into five phases: (no stressor for all); (no stressor in LD ∅ | stressor in LD C , LD E , LD M ); (no stressor for all); (no stressor in LD ∅ | stressor in LD C , LD E , LD M ); (no stressor for all). Table 1(a) illustrates the stressor layout for the Loaded Drives. Table 1: Experimental Design. Experimental sessions are crossovered in (a) and parallel grouped in (b). Full size table Failure Drive: We measured perinasal perspiration, steering angle, and maximum right-side/left-side lane departures on a drive that featured at the end an unintended acceleration incident, during which the vehicle brake had no effect (Failure Drive or FD y , where y denotes the arm of the experiment). Subjects belonging to the y = o arm of the experiment did not have any additional stressor during the FD y drive. Subjects belonging to the y = L arm of the experiment had an additional stressor during the second half of the FD y drive. This stressor was of mixed distracting nature - initially sensorimotor, and then mixed with cognitive alternating with emotional stimuli. The presence or absence of the mixed stressor and the occurrence of the dramatic failure divided the FD y drive into three phases: (no stressor for all); (no stressor for y = o vs. mixed stressor for y = L); (failure event for all). Table 1(b) illustrates the stressor/event layout for the two experimental arms in the Failure Drive. Experimental Validity Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI)10 and Personality A/B11 scores for the subjects whose data were analyzed in this research (n = 59), covered a broad range in the non-extreme regions of the respective scales. Specifically, the TAI scores ranged from 20 to 52 in a scale graded from 20 to 80; mean TAI was 33.22 and the standard deviation was 7.87. The A/B scores ranged from 144 to 282 in a scale graded from 35 to 380; mean A/B was 208.85 and the standard deviation was 30.08. We found no significant correlation of TAI and A/B scores with mean perinasal perspiration responses or mean absolute steering or maximum right-side/left-side lane departures in any of the drives (p > 0.05 for the correlation coefficients in all cases). This suggests that key personality traits that could have biased sympathetic responses, driver reactions, and driver performance did not play any role. To ascertain that the experiment’s challenging drives were perceived as such, we asked subjects to complete the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) after each drive. NASA TLX measures subjective workload assessment on operators working with man-machine interfaces. It draws on six sub-scales TLX s : Mental Demand (TLX MD , s = MD), Physical Demand (TLX PD , s = PD), Temporal Demand (TLX TD , s = TD), Performance (TLX P , s = P), Effort (TLX E , s = E), and Frustration (TLX F , s = F). We ran a mixed effects model to examine the dependence of each sub-scale TLX s on fixed effects, defined by the different types of stressful loaded drives (LD C , LD E , LD M ), keeping the loaded drive with no stressors LD ∅ as the intercept: where k stands for subjects, acting as random effects. The model indicated that loaded drives LD C and LD M with cognitive and sensorimotor stressors, respectively, had significantly higher scores with respect to LD ∅ in all NASA TLX sub-scales (p < 0.001 for all TLX s ). The model also indicated that the emotionally loaded drive LD E had significantly higher scores with respect to LD ∅ in the Mental Demand, Temporal Demand, and Effort sub-scales only (p < 0.01 for TLX MD , TLX TD , TLX E ). These results suggest that subjects perceived drives with cognitive or sensorimotor loads as challenging across the sub-scales of a validated instrument12, thus, confirming the effectiveness of the study’s design regarding these two stressors. The fact that subjects perceived the emotionally loaded drives as challenging in half of the NASA’s instrument sub-scales, suggests that the study’s design was moderately effective in this respect. Introductory Sessions Analysis Comparison among the mean perinasal perspiration signals in the baseline session, the practice drive, and the relaxing drive indicated the absence of any significant differences (p > 0.05, repeated measures analysis of variance). This suggests that in all these cases subjects were hovering close to their tonic levels, in the absence of any serious challenge. Loaded Drives Analysis We analyzed perinasal perspiration (explanatory variable) to determine the sympathetic effect of distractions in loaded drives. Next, we analyzed steering angle (response variable I) to determine how sympathetic effects associate with motor reactions. We also tested and found that age significantly affected the absolute mean steering angle, with older subjects exhibiting larger values (p < 0.05). Finally, we analyzed maximum right-side/left-side lane departures (response variables II) to ascertain how motor reactions are modulated, shaping error prone driving behaviors. Specifically, for the explanatory variable we computed the mean perinasal perspiration signal intensity for each driving phase P i , of each loaded drive LD j , for each subject k. These values represented the mean sympathetic arousals exhibited by the subjects in response to the presence or absence of stress stimuli. For response variable I, we computed the mean angular steering deviation (in absolute terms) for each driving phase P i , of each loaded drive LD j , for each subject k. These steering values served as indicators of motor reactions. Given that the subjects were traveling on a straight highway for 10.4 out of the 10.9 km of the drive, the mean absolute steering value should have been close to zero; the further away from zero, the stronger the sympathetic effect on instantaneous motor responses - an apparent deterioration of steering performance. For response variables II, we computed the maximum lane departures on the right X R (k, LD j , P i ) and left X L (k, LD j , P i ) side of the road for each driving phase P i , of each loaded drive LD j , for each subject k. Here we define lane departure as the position of the car’s center with respect to the right or left boundary of the road, depending on the side it veered off. Ideally, the driver should maintain a nearly constant distance from these boundaries, driving in the middle of her/his lane (X R ≈ X L ≈ 0). If her/his car’s lateral position deviates significantly, then the maximum lane departure values X R and/or X L would increase substantially - a true deterioration of driving performance. For each subject, we normalized the explanatory and response variables with respect to the corresponding variables in the LD ∅ drive that featured no stressor. These LD ∅ baselines represented the subject’s sympathetic state, steering performance, and driving performance under normal conditions. Since the itinerary and environment remained the same in all loaded drives, any mean deviations from the subject’s LD ∅ baselines should be attributed to the forced distractions. Effect of Cognitive Load on Sympathetic State, Steering and Driving Performance For our sample of n = 59 subjects, we computed for each driving phase P i the distributions of paired differences between: • Mean perinasal perspiration in LD C and LD ∅ (Eq. 2) - proxy for sympathetic changes • Mean absolute steering angle in LD C and LD ∅ (Eq. 3) - proxy for steering changes • Maximum lane departures in LD C and LD ∅ on the right and left side (Eq. 4a–4b, ) - proxies for driving changes Equation (2) produced the first row of boxplots in Fig. 1, suggesting that cognitive distraction of subjects in phases and had as a result significant elevation of their mean sympathetic arousal, with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.001, paired t-tests in both cases).

Full size image Equation (3) produced the second row of boxplots in Fig. 1, suggesting that cognitive distraction of subjects in phases and had as a result significant deterioration in mean steering performance, always with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.001 in and p < 0.0125 in , paired t-tests in both cases). It is interesting that deterioration in mean steering performance remained significant in phase with respect to phase in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.001, paired t-test), indicating that there was a lingering behavioral effect on subjects with respect to response variable I, which outlived the second application of the cognitive stressor. Equations (4a–4b), produced the first row of boxplots in Fig. 2, suggesting that cognitive distraction of subjects in phase had as a result significant improvement in terms of maximum right-side and left-side lane departures, with respect to phase in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.001 for X R in and p < 0.0125 for X L in , paired t-tests in both cases).

Full size image Effect of Emotional Load on Sympathetic State, Steering and Driving Performance For our sample of n = 59 subjects, we computed for each driving phase P i the distributions of paired differences between: • Mean perinasal perspiration in LD E and LD ∅ (Eq. 5) - proxy for sympathetic changes • Mean absolute steering angle in LD E and LD ∅ (Eq. 6) - proxy for steering changes • Maximum lane departures in LD E and LD ∅ on the right and left side (Eq. 7a–7b, ) - proxies for driving changes Equation (5) produced the third row of boxplots in Fig. 1, suggesting that emotional distraction of subjects in phases and had as a result significant elevation of their mean sympathetic arousal, with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.001, paired t-tests in both cases). Equation (6) produced the fourth row of boxplots in Fig. 1, suggesting that emotional distraction of subjects in phases and had as a result significant deterioration in mean steering performance, always with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.0125, paired t-tests in both cases).

Effect of Sensorimotor Load on Sympathetic State, Steering and Driving Performance For our sample of n = 59 subjects, we computed for each driving phase P i the distributions of paired differences between: • Mean perinasal perspiration in LD M and LD ∅ (Eq. 8) - proxy for sympathetic changes • Mean absolute steering angle in LD M and LD ∅ (Eq. 9) - proxy for steering changes • Maximum lane departures in LD M and LD ∅ on the right and left side (Eq. 10a–10b, ) - proxies for driving changes Equation (8) produced the fifth row of boxplots in Fig. 1, suggesting that sensorimotor distraction of subjects in phases and had as a result significant elevation of their mean sympathetic arousal, with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.001 in and p < 0.0125 in , paired t-tests in both cases). Equation (9) produced the sixth row of boxplots in Fig. 1, suggesting that sensorimotor distraction of subjects in phases and had as a result significant deterioration in mean steering performance, always with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.001, paired t-tests in both cases). It is interesting that deterioration in mean steering performance remained significant in phases and with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.001, paired t-tests in both cases), indicating that there was a lingering behavioral effect on subjects with respect to response variable I, which outlived each application of the sensorimotor stressor. Equations (10a–10b), produced the third row of boxplots in Fig. 2, suggesting that sensorimotor distraction of subjects in phases and had as a result significant deterioration in terms of right and left lane departures, with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.0125 for X R in and , p < 0.001 for X L in and , paired t-tests in all cases). This behavioral effect on subjects with respect to response variables X R and X L tended to linger in , outliving the first application of the sensorimotor stressor (p < 0.0125 for X R and p < 0.001 for X L in , paired t-tests in both cases). Failure Drive Analysis In the Failure Drive, for the y = o group we found that phase featured significantly higher values than phase in terms of mean sympathetic responses (p < 0.0125, paired t-test - Fig. 3a1). In contradistinction, for the y = L group we found that phase featured significantly lower values than phase both in terms of mean sympathetic and mean absolute steering signals (p < 0.001, paired t-tests in both cases - Fig. 3b1). Figure 3: Statistics for Failure Drive’s first two phases. Mean perinasal perspiration and absolute steering distributions for: (a1) The y = o group. (b1) The y = L group. § Failure Drive examples.

The dashed horizontal lines indicate the mean values in the corresponding signal segments. Full size image Figure 3a2,b2 depict sympathetic (i.e., perinasal perspiration) and absolute steering signals from subjects representative of the y = o and y = L groups, respectively. In the y = o example, the subject’s sympathetic signal was somewhat elevated in phase with respect to phase in the mean sense. This could be ascribed to the start-up effect, where the sympathetic system responds to the driving transition from idle to a steady state. In the y = L example, however, the sympathetic and absolute steering signals during phase (non-loaded phase) were significantly lower with respect to phase (loaded phase) in the mean sense. Specifically, during the loaded portion of the drive the steering signal became highly variable, indicating that the driver had frequently strong impulsive motor responses. Apparently, the dramatic effect of the mixed stressor during the loaded phase of the Failure Drive overwhelmed any start-up effect characterizing its initial non-loaded phase . Running a mixed effects model to examine the dependence of mean absolute steering on fixed effects: • : mean perinasal perspiration adjusted to each subject’s resting baseline, • y: sympathetic load indicator (y = o vs. y = L), • AG: age group (Young: <27 vs. Old: >60), we found that all three variables representing fixed effects bore significance in predicting steering behavior (p < 0.05); subjects were treated as random effects. Furthermore, the coefficients in all cases were positive. Hence, for each of the load and age binary variables as we moved from the low level (y = o and AG = Young) to the high level (y = L and AG = Old), steering increased. Importantly, for fixed y and AG, higher values of mean perinasal perspiration (indicating elevated arousal) were correlated with higher mean absolute steering values (Fig. 4a). Figure 4b shows how higher mean absolute steering values under the spell of the mixed stressor in , resulted in ominous lane departures and outright traffic violations; the difference from the orderly itinerary patterns in , , and is striking.

White, yellow, and pink pavement indicate phase , , and , respectively. Lane departures in , where the mixed stressor applied, are striking, suggesting an increased risk of accident. Extreme lane departures in are the results of the startling incidence - almost all cars crashed. Crash - No Crash incidents following the unintended acceleration event in phase according to: (c1) Load. (c2) Age. Full size image Specifically, mixed distraction of subjects in phase had as a result highly significant deterioration in terms of maximum right-side and left-side lane departures, with respect to phase where no-stressor applied (p < 0.001 for X R and X L in both cases). By contrast, there was no significant deterioration in terms of maximum right-side and left-side lane departures in phase with respect to , for the y = o (no stressor) arm of the experiment. It is important to note that we adjusted the individual perinasal perspiration signals by subtracting the mean tonic level (resting baseline) of each subject, correspondingly. This was necessary for fair comparison, as each person had a different sympathetic baseline and what was of interest was to find how much the drive and the distractions raised the subject’s sympathetic state above her/his resting baseline. Regarding the unintended acceleration event that took place the last 10 s of the Failure Drive (phase ), the question was if prior distraction or any other factor, played a role in the subject’s crash risk CR. Running a logistic regression model to examine the dependence of crash risk CR on fixed effects: • : mean perinasal perspiration adjusted to each subject’s resting baseline, • y: sympathetic load indicator (y = o vs. y = L), • AG: age group (Young: <27 vs. Old: >60), we found that all variables representing fixed effects had no significance in predicting crash odds (p > 0.05). In fact, as Fig. 4c1,c2 illustrate, a very small number of drivers avoided crashing, among those who experienced the unintended acceleration event. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A recent study, funded in part by the Toyota Class Action Settlement Safety Research and Education Program, reveals that, whilst distracted driving may lead to better lane control and ultimately a safer journey, texting while driving interrupts hand-eye coordination and increases the likelihood of an accident.

Is the gap between the rich and poor a religious problem as well as a social problem in desperate need of solutions? Jesus, Pope Francis, and brain scientists have asked these questions, and the answers are clear if unnerving. Wealth and power are dangerous for your mental health, your spiritual condition, and for society in general -- especially when they contribute to the neglect of the poor. New research explains how this works (more on this in a minute). Ridding the world of poverty is, of course, a fantasy. Jesus knew this: \\"You will always have the poor among you,\\" he said (Matthew 26:11). He also said, \\"God blesses you who are poor, for the kingdom of God is yours.\\" (Luke 6:20). Only a few verses before this moment in Luke, he cries (echoing the Old Testament): \\"The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring the good news to the poor.\\" (Luke 4:18). Is it any wonder that when a rich young man came to OPTIONS: - CNN asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - God asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Jay Parini asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Jesus asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Lord asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Luke asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Matthew 26:11 asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Old Testament asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Parini asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Pope asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Pope Francis asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Ridding asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - South Korea asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\"","completion":"Is it any wonder that when a rich young man came to Jesus asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" (Matthew 19:21). This teaching underscores the notion that material wealth can act as a barrier to spiritual growth and the development of true compassion for others. And in today's society, this message is more relevant than ever. The increase in wealth inequality reveals a widening gap between those who have more than they could ever need and those who struggle to meet basic needs. This growing divide poses not only a social and economic issue but also a moral and spiritual one. It's easy to become blinded by the pursuit of wealth and success, losing sight of our interconnectedness and shared humanity. As brain scientists delve further into understanding how wealth impacts our mental and emotional well-being, studies have shown that wealthier individuals tend to be more self-focused, less empathetic, and less compassionate. These deficits can significantly hinder spiritual growth and meaningful connections with others. In contrast, those with fewer material attachments often demonstrate a greater appreciation for the people and experiences that enrich their lives. Pope Francis has been a vocal advocate for the moral responsibility to care for the poor and marginalized. His calls for a \\"culture of encounter\\" challenge us to engage with those who are different from ourselves, whether in terms of socio-economic status, race, or religion, promoting empathy, understanding, and compassion. Such encounters can foster spiritual growth and lead us towards a shared sense of humanity. Not only religious leaders but also scientists, activists, and policymakers must actively work together to address the widening gap between the rich and poor. Though completely eradicating poverty may be an unattainable goal, striving to create a more equitable society is indeed a noble endeavor. Through fostering a sense of collective responsibility and empathy, we can work towards bridging this gap and ultimately cultivating a more compassionate, spiritually rich world. To achieve this, individuals with wealth and power must be encouraged to focus less on the accumulation of material possessions and more on the cultivation of empathy, compassion, and a willingness to actively work towards solving the problems facing the less fortunate. This shift in values can bring about genuine happiness, spiritual growth, and a greater connection to our shared humanity - fulfilling the promise Jesus offers in his teachings on wealth, poverty, and spiritual development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which topic is this article about?","completion":"This article is about the performance of various sectors in the U.S. stock market with specific focus on blue-chip stocks, technology stocks, and their relationship with oil prices. It primarily covers two major points: 1. The Effect of Rising Oil Prices on U.S. Blue-chip Stocks: The first part of the article deals with the performance of U.S. blue-chip stocks and how they were affected by rising oil prices. Blue-chip stocks are shares in large, nationally recognized, financially sound companies with a record of stable and reliable growth. The article mentions that these blue-chip stocks fell due to increasing oil prices, which suggests that the rising oil prices added a significant amount of cost and economic uncertainty to these companies, thus negatively affecting their stock prices. 2. Impact of Analyst Ratings on Specific Stocks: The second main focus of this article is the role of analyst ratings on specific stocks, specifically Pfizer and Apple. It mentions how an analyst downgrade (a negative change in stock rating by a financial analyst) of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer might have influenced the market and contributed to the lower end for blue-chip stocks. On the other hand, the article also mentions how tech stocks, particularly Apple, managed to gain, thanks largely to an upgrade; an upgrade typically refers to a positive change in stock rating by a financial analyst. This implies that despite the broad market factors such as rising oil prices, specific factors such as an analyst upgrade can also have a significant influence on individual stock prices. It also points out an interesting dynamic of the market where not all sectors move in the same direction. While the broader market represented by blue-chip stocks declined, technology stocks represented by companies such as Apple managed a small gain. So, the overall topic of this article is the complex and multifaceted nature of the stock market, specifically highlighting the diverging performances of blue-chip stocks and technology stocks in light of changes in oil prices and analyst upgrades or downgrades. It provides insights into how broader economic forces like oil prices and more specific factors such as analyst ratings can influence the performance of different sectors in the stock market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Snow and cold to hit Massachusetts Tuesday A mix of rain and snow hit the Boston metro area Tuesday evening, leading to a messy evening commute, the National Weather Service said. Residents of Western Massachusetts have already seen some snow, the weather service said. The storm system is expected to increase in intensity as it moves eastward across the state. “Be aware and be prepared for adverse weather conditions as we go into the later portion of this afternoon and this evening,” weather service meteorologist Benjamin Sipprell said. Sipprell said visibility will be down to a quarter-mile. “Just be prepared on area roadways,” he said, “because snow will definitely accumulate and make for slick and slippery conditions.” Take a look at the places getting hit hard by the snow. Temperatures will drop into the 20s during the evening, as rain is expected to change into snow that will fall late into the night. In Boston, less than a half an inch of snow is expected, the weather service said Tuesday. But in Central and Western Massachusetts, accumulations could reach 2 inches, the weather service said. “Have some caution this evening when you’re driving,” weather service meteorologist Kim Buttrick said. “Leave enough room between yourself and the car in front of you. ... Maybe drive a little bit slower than the speed limit.” “This is a quick-hitting storm system,” she added, saying snowfall should wind down by midnight. Highs Wednesday are expected to only be in the mid-20s to low 30s across Massachusetts, with blustery winds gusting up to 30 miles per hour. “The real cold air comes in tomorrow,” Buttrick said. “It’s going to feel even colder because of the wind.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about a mix of rain and snow hitting the Boston metro area and Massachusetts on a Tuesday evening, leading to a messy evening commute.

Read this and answer the question The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, 69 feet (21 metres) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.

Do they have the same meaning?","completion":"Yes, both sentences have the same overall meaning, but they are expressed differently. I'll break down the components of each sentence to further explain their meanings: Sentence 1: \\"Other data showed that buyers snapped up new and existing homes at a brisk pace in April, spurred by low mortgage rates.\\" Sentence 2: \\"Other data showed sales of existing and new homes grew at a robust pace in April, spurred by low mortgage rates.\\" Let's analyze the key elements in both sentences: 1. \\"Other data\\": Both sentences start with the same phrase, referring to additional data or information being presented. 2. \\"buyers snapped up new and existing homes\\" (Sentence 1) and \\"sales of existing and new homes\\" (Sentence 2): Both phrases focus on the activity in the housing market, specifically related to new and existing homes. In Sentence 1, the emphasis is on the buyers purchasing these homes quickly, while Sentence 2 directly refers to the sales of these homes. Essentially, these phrases are two different ways of presenting the same idea – that there was a significant increase in the housing market. 3. \\"at a brisk pace\\" (Sentence 1) and \\"grew at a robust pace\\" (Sentence 2): Both phrases describe the speed at which the housing market experienced growth. \\"Brisk\\" and \\"robust\\" both suggest a strong and rapid pace of growth, although \\"robust\\" might suggest a slightly higher level of intensity. 4. \\"in April\\": Both sentences refer to the same time period during which this growth in the housing market occurred. 5. \\"spurred by low mortgage rates\\": Lastly, both sentences end with the same explanation for this increased growth in the housing market – the influence of low mortgage rates. In conclusion, both sentences convey the same overall message: that there was a strong and rapid increase in the sales of new and existing homes in April, driven by low mortgage rates. The sentences use slightly different language to express this meaning, but the key points and the intended message are the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article using the following points: Paul Griffith was stopped at Stansted airport on his way to Malaga. The 75-year-old was asked to take his shoes off before he made the remark. Airport staff called police and on his return from Spain he was arrested. But 24 hours before appearing in court the CPS dropped all charges. Article:","completion":"Title: The Incident at Stansted: Paul Griffith's encounter with airport security The tranquillity of an airport - a place that often sits in stark contrast to the life-filled destinations it serves - can be quickly overshadowed by security alerts. Paul Griffith, a 75-year-old British citizen, recently discovered this disquieting fact during a seemingly routine security check at London's Stansted Airport. Before proceeding to the idyllic Spanish city of Malaga, Griffith was stopped by airport security officials, an all-too-common occurrence in the post-9/11 era. However, the mundane request issued by the staff – to remove his shoes as part of the regular security protocol - unexpectedly catapulted the septuagenarian into a maelstrom of legal entanglements. Following that request, Griffith made a remark which set in motion a chain of events leading to his arrest. With earnest concern about maintaining airport security, staffers at Stansted immediately reported Griffith's comment to the police. Regardless of the significance of his remark, the seriousness of airport safety protocols cannot be underestimated – it is, after all, a matter of life and death for the thousands of passengers that transit through these landscape of terminals and runways daily. Completing his journey under the heavy clouds of uncertainty, Griffith returned to England from Spain, only to be arrested by the police. The arrest served as a stark reminder that safety measures in the world of air travel are subject to a zero-tolerance strategy towards any perceived threats or unusual behavior. However, in a surprising turn of events and just 24 hours prior to his appearance in court, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided to drop all charges against Griffith. Whether this signifies a flaw in the efficiency of UK's security and justice system or whether the CPS deemed that his comments were not a threat after all, remains a subject of conjecture. What is clear, though, is that this incident serves as a potent pointer towards the intricate balance that needs to be maintained between robust security procedures and the rights of individuals in an airport setting. While not undermining the need for strict security measures, one wonders whether there is a bridge that connects extreme vigilance with respect for personal liberty. Could this incident serve as a catalyst for a more nuanced and contextual analysis of situations at airports, rather than a trigger-responsive set of actions predicated on perceived threats? Nevertheless, amidst safety protocols and flights to sunny Spanish climates, Griffith's story presents an interesting point of discussion about the state of airport security and the tensions that often simmer just beneath its surface."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

Anthony Weiner was so oversexed, he had phone sex as many as seven times in a single day, according to the woman at the center of the mayoral candidate’s second sexting scandal in the past two years. Sydney Leathers, Weiner’s web mistress who brought his “Carlos Danger” alter ego — as well as images of the politician’s private parts — to light, sat down with Howard Stern Tuesday, where she dished dirty, dirty details on the horny politician’s kinky predilections, including a fetish for feet and heels. PHOTOS: See All Of Anthony Weiner’s Explicit Facebook Messages And while much of what she said is too raunchy to repeat here, the details will leave you wondering how Weiner would find time to keep his pants on long enough to be mayor of New York! Leathers, a self-described “political junkie,” told the King of All Media that she initially reached out to Weiner on Facebook to express her disappointment in his actions in the wake of the 2011 sex scandal that saw him resign from Congress. Leathers said he poked her back on the social media site a full year later, and after trading a few innocuous messages, the two were engaging in hot-and-heavy banter and photo exchanges. “It didn’t take long — he didn’t have a good segue, he just went right into it,” she said, admitting she was infatuated with him at the time. PHOTOS: 12 Celebrity Couples Who’ve Survived Scandal “It’s amazing to me because he got in so much trouble the first time around,” Stern observed. Leathers said they would both pleasure themselves when talking to each other, saying that while she found the Democrat to be “well endowed,” he wasn’t much in the stamina department. “He was like, ‘Oh yeah, thank you baby’ … it was just like, ‘Conversation over'” after Weiner was finished. But, Leathers added, she’d “hear from him very quickly after” for another steamy exchange. PHOTOS: 12 Celebrity Couples Who’ve Survived Scandal And while she did not use the term Minute Man, she made it clear that no time was lost in getting to the end as many as seven times a day. “You would think his (bleep) would hurt by the end of it,” she joked. “How can you be mayor of New York City when you’re (bleeping) like five times a day?” “Well Clinton was president,” Stern sidekick Robin Quivers chimed in. Leathers revealed some of Weiner’s sexual talk and more. She’s admitted to a promiscuous past and a profitable presence on Sugar Daddy-soliciting websites over the years and now says she’s looking to parlay her newfound notoriety into a lucrative sex tape deal. PHOTOS: Anthony Weiner In Woman’s Underwear She and her agent, former porn star Gina Rodriguez, said their next stop Tuesday was to Weiner’s house, where they would do a photoshoot. Asked by Stern if she’d be getting naughty with any other prominent politicians, Leathers said, “Chris Christie‘s above my weight limit.” Leathers said she came forward because she resented Weiner’s duplicity in his latest mayoral campaign. “He lured me into this situation and he didn’t want to own up to it,” she said, while Rodriguez chimed in, “I think people should be applauding her really, that she did this.” Applause?

Leathers boasts of offering sex for money, as well as her rampant drug use, her desire to \\"ruin\\" Weiner and fear that she herself was being blackmailed. These shocking new revelations heap further embarrassment on the shamed New York City mayoral candidate, who is being pressured to quit the race. Weiner has steadfastly refused to drop out, despite falling from first to fourth place in Democratic primary polling since the sexting scandal broke. How long he can stay in remains an open question, however, especially after more information comes out about the dealings of Sydney Leathers. A series of Facebook message exchanges with friend Lou Colagiovanni, spanning a period of four months (April-July of this year) has come to light. In one June 6 message, Leathers stated: \\"I’m seeing this one sugar daddy right now who pays me 1,000 to go down on me for half an hour.\\" Colagiovanni asked: \\"Does he possess any skill or is it a dull 30 minutes? Ahh Well for 1,000 a few moans and shouts should be included.\\" Miss Leathers responded: \\"He isn’t very good at it but I can fake it ... I don’t have to do anything except pretend I like it though so it’s not a bad gig lol.\\" In later communications, Sydney Leathers admitted to being active on a sugar daddy websites offering services to older men \\"on and off\\" for a year. \\"I get money from dudes I’ve never even met,\\" she claims. \\"People are super-pathetic.

Weiner, who \\"met\\" Leathers online when he \\"poked\\" her in response to a comment she made about his 2011 sexting scandal. Then the man asking 10 million people to trust him with their city sent nude photos, engaged in phone sex, professed his love and offered to get her an apartment in Chicago.

A majority of New York voters think Anthony Weiner should drop out of the mayoral race, according to a citywide poll released Monday afternoon. Fifty-three percent of respondents in the poll of likely voters said that Weiner should quit the race, versus 40% who said he should stay in, Quinnipiac found. While the news was bad for Weiner, the poll featured an unprecedented show of strength from public advocate Bill de Blasio, who ranked second behind city council speaker Christine Quinn. Twenty-seven percent of voters said Quinn would be their pick for mayor, versus 21% who selected de Blasio. Former city comptroller Bill Thompson notched 20% in the poll, versus 16% for Weiner. Support has deteriorated dramatically for Weiner in the week since the public learned that he continued to send strangers pictures of his genitals after resigning from Congress in June 2011 in disgrace over the behavior. His campaign manager quit abruptly on Sunday. In a snap overnight poll conducted by Marist immediately after the new pictures came to light, 47% of respondents thought Weiner should stay in the race, while 43% thought he should drop out. That was before Weiner endured days of tough questions about his behavior and public humiliation at the hands of the tabloid press. A Quinnipiac poll released just prior to the latest flare-up in the Weiner scandal found the former congressman in the lead over Quinn by 26-22. Consistently strong polling by Quinn, the frontrunner in most surveys, belies her potential vulnerability in a mayoral runoff, to be held if no one candidate gains 40% of the vote. Quinn's net favorability rating has lagged both De Blasio and Thompson, potential runoff opponents.

TMZ says nothing is yet known about what exactly went on during the meeting between Hirsch and the porn-named Leathers at Vivid's headquarters in LA over the weekend, but, as the gossip site notes, \\"you don't get in [Hirsch's] car unless you're lookin' for a ride.\\" Vivid, of Farrah Abraham's \\"sex tape\\" fame, is no doubt looking to capitalize on Weiner's new woes, and the pressure is on to beat other porn production houses, at least one of which has just announced a Weiner-themed porn parody starring Weiner sexting alum Ginger Lee. Meanwhile, Weiner seems poised to prolong the scandal with fresh rumors that his sexting days aren't yet behind him. [screengrabs via TMZ] ||||| We're hearing for the first time from the young woman at the center of the Anthony Weiner sexting scandal. Twenty-three-year-old Sydney Leathers spoke exclusively to INSIDE EDITION about the raunchy text messages and phone calls she exchanged with Weiner, who's now running for mayor of New York City. \\"Anthony Weiner is responsible for his downfall,\\" said Leathers.\\"I feel sick about it. I'm disgusted by him. He is not who I thought he was.\\" Watch video of Part 1 of our interview here. INSIDE EDITION's Jim Moret said to Leathers, \\"I read one quote that suggested you thought he was a dirty old man.\\" Leathers replied, \\"He actually said that about himself to me. The exact wording is that he an argumentative, perpetually horny middle-aged man.\\" Leathers says her bizarre relationship with Weiner began in June, 2011 after he resigned from Congress in disgrace for sending images to women he met online. Leathers sent him a Facebook message, criticizing his behavior. Out of the blue, a year later in July, 2012, she says he replied with a Facebook poke, a simple way of saying 'hi.' Moret asked, \\"When did things turn dark and dirty?\\" \\"Very quickly,\\" said Leathers. \\"Who prompted that?\\" asked Moret. \\"He did,\\" she replied. \\"So, Anthony Weiner moved your conversation from professional to dirty?\\" \\"Yes,\\" said Leathers. They began to exchanged steamy text messages. In one of the tamer ones, Weiner writes: \\"What are you wearing? Much for me to take off? I'd hold u by the throat.\\" He used a pseudonym that's become infamous overnight: Carlos Danger. \\"It sounds ridiculous,\\" said Moret. Leathers said, \\"It is ridiciulous. I never really said anything about it, but I thought it was very silly.\\" She says she was shocked when Weiner texted her a risque self-picture that we can't show. \\"I was absolutely shocked that he was willing to do that. And the fact that it was his idea is even more shocking,\\" said Leathers. She says she and Weiner also had phone-sex at least twice a week. \\"Did you get the sense that he was acting out on the phone calls?\\" asked Moret. \\"Absolutely, yes,\\" she answered. \\"And were they real for you, as well?\\" \\"I think it was a fantasy thing for the both of us,\\" said Leathers. The sexting was constant, with Weiner writing: \\"I've found the perfect woman. Gorgeous, sexy and like a bit of crazy.\\" She replied: \\"I basically worship the ground you walk on. You're incredible.\\" Moret asked, \\"Did you think at that time that you loved Anthony Weiner?\\" \\"Maybe not loved, but I definitely cared about him,\\" said Leathers. Leathers is from Mount Carmel, Illinois and is a college sophomore majoring in political science. \\"I'm a total political junky, nerd,\\" she admits. Leathers says their sexting relationship ended in November, 2012. She thought Weiner was jealous that other men were leaving messages on her Facebook page. \\"What would upset him?\\" asked Moret. She explained, \\"Me being hit on by other men really upset him. We were Facebook friends, so he could see if men were commenting on photos of me, or telling me that I was pretty. Really minor things like that really bothered him.\\" She told Moret she last communicated with Weiner on Facebook four months ago when he announced he was running for mayor of New York. He texted her: \\"Do me a solid. Can you hard delete all our chats here.\\" Leathers said, \\"Obviously I knew that he wanted me to erase any evidence of our conversations, because that was around the time I knew that he was going to run for mayor.\\" She says her relationship with Weiner reminded him of the Netflix series House of Cards, where actor Kevin Spacey plays a seedy congressman who carries on an affair with a reporter. Moret asked, \\"Did you think, 'Oh my gosh, that's my life right now.'\\" \\"Yes. When I saw House of Cards, I think it gave me a little bit of a panic attack, honestly,\\" said Leathers. She wept when we showed her Weiner's news conference where he acknowledged their relationship. She wants to apologize to his wife, Huma Abedin. \\"I just feel very, very sorry for my part and the pain that she obviously feels,\\" said Leathers. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Anthony Weiner, a former New York Congressman and mayoral candidate, was implicated in two sexting scandals in two years, the second of which involved a young woman named Sydney Leathers. According to Leathers, her relationship with Weiner began when she reached out to him on Facebook to express her disappointment with his past sex scandal. A year later, Weiner responded to her, and their conversation quickly turned sexual. They exchanged explicit messages and engaged in phone sex several times a day. Leathers claimed that Weiner had a fetish for feet and heels and seemed to be persistently oversexed. Despite these actions leading to his resignation from Congress in the past, Weiner again engaged in this behavior while running for the mayoral position. Leathers revealed that Weiner was selfish and quick during their phone sex interactions, and they would proceed to start a new session almost immediately after ending one. When Weiner announced his intention to run for mayor, he asked Leathers to delete all their conversation history. Denied by the scandal, Weiner fell from first to fourth place in Democratic primary polling. Still, he refused to drop out of the race despite the growing calls for his withdrawal. As for Leathers, she leveraged her newfound notoriety into various ventures, expressing interest in doing a sex tape and even meeting with porn mogul Steve Hirsch. She participated in interviews and photoshoots, capitalizing on the scandal. Despite stating early in the scandal that she did not want attention nor intended to make money off of it, Leathers was clear to disregard that position as she navigated the situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How to seal granite countertops Test whether the granite needs sealing. Ignoring the claims of late-night sales pitches, many granite counter tops are better left unsealed. To test your surface, leave a few drops of water or a wet paper towel on the granite for 10 to 15 minutes. Possible answers: a). The water will help open pores and allow easier drainage. Always test for cracks before sealing granite countertops. b). A telltale sign of a wet coating and \\" dry glaze \\" will show up regardless. If your granite manufacturer states they're \\" water proofing \\" their granite countertops, let them dry for 24 to 48 hours before handling them. c). If the top comes off cleanly, the granite is ready to use. Put on gloves and a dust mask. d). If the water begins to soak into and darken the counter top, continue to the next step to begin sealing. If the water remains beaded on the surface, the counter top is already stain-resistant, and should not be sealed.","completion":"d). If the water begins to soak into and darken the countertop, continue to the next step to begin sealing. If the water remains beaded on the surface, the countertop is already stain-resistant, and should not be sealed. If the countertop needs sealing, clean the surface thoroughly with water, mild dish soap, and a soft cloth, gently removing any dirt or residue. Rinse the countertop well with water and then dry it with a clean, lint-free cloth. Make sure the surface is completely dry before proceeding to the next step. Choose a high-quality granite sealer, which is specifically designed for natural stone surfaces. It is important to read and follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and drying times. Some sealers may require a single application, while others may call for two or more coats. Before applying the sealer, you should protect any nearby surfaces or fixtures, such as sinks or cabinetry, by covering them with plastic sheeting or painter's tape. Pour the granite sealer onto a clean, white cloth or use a spray bottle to apply it to the surface of the countertop. Gently work the sealer into the granite using circular motions, overlapping each area to ensure full coverage. Once the entire surface has been treated, allow the sealer to penetrate the granite for the recommended amount of time, as indicated by the product's instructions. Generally, this period can range from 10 to 20 minutes, with certain sealers requiring more time. When the specified time has elapsed, use a clean, white cloth to wipe off any excess sealer from the surface of the granite. This will prevent streaking or hazing. Allow the sealer to dry and cure for the period specified by the manufacturer. This can range from a couple of hours to a full day, depending on the product. It is essential to keep the countertop free of water, spills, and other liquids during this time. After the sealer has fully cured, some granite sealers may require buffing with a clean, soft cloth or a polishing pad to achieve optimal shine and protection. Regularly test and maintain your granite countertops by repeating this process every one to three years or as needed, depending on the wear and tear your countertops receive. This will ensure that your countertops continue to resist staining and maintain their beautiful appearance for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sir Edmund Walker and Eric Brown of the National Gallery of Canada wanted to purchase In the Northland, but Montreal trustee Dr. Francis Shepherd convinced them to purchase Spring Ice instead. The reception of Thomson's paintings at this time was mixed. Margaret Fairbairn of the Toronto Daily Star wrote, \\"Mr. Tom Thomson's 'The Birches' and 'The Hardwoods' show a fondness for intense yellows and orange and strong blue, altogether a fearless use of violent colour which can scarcely be called pleasing, and yet which seems an exaggeration of a truthful feeling that time will temper.\\" A more favourable take came from artist Wyly Grier in The Christian Science Monitor: Tom Thomson again reveals his capacity to be modern and remain individual. His early pictures—in which the quality of naivete had all the genuineness of the effort of the tyro and was not the counterfeit of it which is so much in evidence in the intensely rejuvenated works of the highly sophisticated—showed the faculty for affectionate and truthful record by a receptive eye and faithful hand; but his work today has reached higher levels of technical accomplishment. His Moonlight, Spring Ice and The Birches are among his best.

Article: 00:32 Stargazers Might See Green ‘Incredible Hulk’ Comet Pass Earth Soon Observers in the Northern Hemisphere have the best chance to see the comet Tuesday and Wednesday. At a Glance The best time to view the comet in the Northern Hemisphere will be Tuesday and Wednesday. Remnants of the comet will come within 70.4 million miles of Earth. Remnants of a green comet nicknamed the \\"Incredible Hulk\\" will zip by Earth this week, offering stargazers a view of a dust cloud at least twice the size of Jupiter. Discovered in September 2017, PanSTARRS C/2017 S3 reportedly broke up in late July as it approached the sun. The remaining dust cloud will make its closest approach to Earth on Tuesday, coming within 70.4 million miles (113.4 million kilometers) of the planet, Sputnik News reports. The comet's green glow, the result of cyanide and carbon molecules becoming ionized by the warmth of the sun, may increase as it makes its way closer to the sun, astronomers say. The 161,000-mile-long gas cloud that originated from several eruptions of the comet in June and early July may cause electromagnetic disturbances in the Earth's atmosphere, Austrian amateur astronomer Michael Jäger‎ told sott.net. The comet, electrified by solar wind, was expected to be visible with the naked eye. But it broke apart from intense solar heat and is rapidly fading from view. Experts don't rule out another eruption in the coming days, which could make the comet brighter in the night sky. The best time to view the comet in the Northern Hemisphere will be Tuesday and Wednesday. As the dust cloud approaches the sun, it will become less visible in the sky, astronomers say. On Tuesday night, scattered showers and thunderstorms may hinder the view in portions of the East, Midwest and central Plains. The best areas for viewing will be from the northern Plains into much of the West, where partly cloudy to mostly clear skies are expected. However, views in some areas of the West may be impacted by smoke, says weather.com meteorologist Linda Lam. On Wednesday night, areas from the East into the southern Plains and Southwest will see clouds, showers and thunderstorms, but clouds shouldn't impede viewing in the upper Midwest to the West Coast. The only real chance for a view of the comet in the Southern Hemisphere will be just before dawn Aug. 15. ||||| Skywatchers in the northern hemisphere have been watching a green comet bursting with light that keeps growing brighter as it nears the sun. Officially named PanSTARRS (C/2017 S3) or — more prosaically — the 'Incredible Hulk,' due to its size, the comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Earth on August 7, Russian Media outlet Izvestia reported, citing Russian comet and meteorite researcher Yevgeniy Dmitriyev. \\"The size of the gas-dust cloud of the celestial body is at least twice the size of the largest planet in the Solar System: Jupiter,\\" Dmitriyev said, cited by Izvestia. The Incredible Hulk was reportedly discovered September 2017. The space giant is surrounded by 260,000-kilometer-long cloud of dust and gas, which is electrified by the solar wind, Dmitiriyev said. ​Russian researcher says that the Incredible Hulk will miss our planet, pointing out its closest pass to Earth will come at some 113.4 million kilometers. However, its giant cloud of space dust could potentially cause electromagnetic disturbances in the Earth's atmosphere, endangering vital processes. \\"When the Earth passes through the gas-dust environment of a bright comet, a giant lightning may occur which generates a powerful cometary electromagnetic pulse that can be ruinous for civilization,\\" Dmitriyev said, cited by Izvestia. The demise of comet C/2017 S3 (PANSTARRS) After two spectacular outbursts in early and mid July, the nucleus of comet C/2017 S3 (PANSTARRS) has finally disintegrated. Farewell, comet PANSTARRS!https://t.co/ZHimRj4TeU pic.twitter.com/q6AU3n6HF1 — Northolt Branch Obs (@NBObservatories) 27 июля 2018 г. Astronomers say that PanSTARRS (C/2017 S3) will reach its perihelion, or the closest point to the sun, on Aug. 16. It will be prowling just within the orbit of Mercury, where its nearness to the sun will make it a prime target for a blast of solar radiation. Meanwhile, its proximity to the sun will make it almost impossible to be seen in mid-August. Astronomers say the best times to spot the green comet in the northern hemisphere are on the first few days of the month, particularly August 7 and 8. In the southern hemisphere, there is less chance to spot the comet, although it may be visible for a brief period before sunrise on August 15 after it turns away from our star, The Tech Times reported, citing Austrian astronomer Michael Jaeger. However, Russian astronomer Stanislav Short was quoted by Russian media outlets as saying that Incredible Hulk, despite its \\"threatening approach\\" toward Earth and its tail of \\"giant electrified gas cloud,\\" poses no danger as the comet broke up last month, and adding that such space objects have passed by our planet many times in the past without apocalyptic consequences. |||||Summary:","completion":"A green comet called PanSTARRS C/2017 S3, also known as the \\"Incredible Hulk\\", is set to pass Earth this week, providing stargazers with a spectacular celestial display.

Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"Despite a few differences in structure and wording, both sentences convey similar information. However, they are not identical in meaning since they refer to different licensors in Taiwan and North America. I'll break down each sentence to explain further: Sentence 1: It is licensed and published in Taiwan by Blu on May 8, 2007. The manga is licensed in North America by Sharp Point Press. This sentence tells us that the manga was licensed and published in Taiwan by a company called Blu on May 8, 2007. At the same time, it indicates that a company named Sharp Point Press is responsible for licensing the manga in North America. Sentence 2: It is licensed and published in North America by Blu on 8 May 2007, and is licensed by Sharp Point Press in Taiwan. This sentence indicates that the manga was licensed and published in North America by Blu on May 8, 2007, and it was licensed by Sharp Point Press in Taiwan. There seems to be a discrepancy between the two sentences regarding the licensing entities. In the first sentence, it states that Sharp Point Press licenses the manga in North America, while the second sentence suggests that Blu licenses and published it in North America. Moreover, there is a confusion with Taiwan as the first sentence states Blu licensed and published it there while the second sentence implies Sharp Point Press is the licensing company in Taiwan. To summarize, both sentences convey the message that the manga was licensed and published on May 8, 2007, but they provide different information about the companies responsible for licensing in Taiwan and North America. Therefore, while these sentences share some similarities, they do not mean precisely the same thing due to conflicting information regarding the licensing entities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Egg oil (also known as ovum oil and egg yolk oil) is derived from the yolk of chicken eggs and contains mainly fatty acid derivatives (e.g. triglycerides, lecithin) as well as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which help revitalize the follicle cells in your hair. In addition, it also contains anti-oxidant xanthophylls, like lutein and zeaxanthin, which arrest premature aging (graying) in your hair, and immunoglobulins, which reduce inflammation. As an added bonus, the cholesterol in egg oil brings luster and shine to your hair and eliminates dandruff. Egg oil is mess free and stable. It is a more convenient alternative to egg yolk masks and does not smell like raw egg yolks or cook in the hair during a hot shower. There is no risk of salmonella which could give you a scalp infection. You can make your own egg oil simply by heating egg yolks on the stove in a saucepan until they elicit a dark colored oil. Make sure to cool the oil before applying to your scalp, as you don't want to burn yourself. You can also mix the egg oil with ingredients like two tablespoons olive oil to make create more of a mask and easier to apply. Another option would be to a tablespoon or so of honey, both for its nice scent for also for the shine and vitality it will add to your hair. You can purchase egg oil commercially. Just make sure that you are buying 100% egg oil and not something combined with artificial solutions or chemicals. Using your fingertips, work the egg oil into your scalp gently with small circular motions. Do this for five to ten minutes. Make sure you've evenly spread the egg oil into your scalp. Egg oil needs time to act. Leave it on at least three hours or preferably overnight. If you wear it overnight, do not forget to cover your pillow with a cloth to prevent oil stains. Alternatively, you could wrap your head in a clean towel after you apply the oil to your scalp and then sleep with the towel on, though this may or may not be comfortable for your neck. Shampoo off the egg oil the next morning (or whenever you're in between egg oil applications) with a gentle, high quality shampoo, preferably an herbal or natural shampoo with no artificial ingredients or chemicals. Use shampoo only once as repetition removes the natural lipids of hair making it dry and brittle. If possible, let your hair air dry after shampooing. This remove the possibility of further damaging your hair through the high heat and power of a blowdryer. Apply, massage, and leave egg oil on your sleep at least twice a week for at least 12 weeks for visible results. Regular, continued use is important for proper nourishment of the follicular cell membranes in the hair. Continue long term massage therapy of egg oil to prevent hair loss and graying. Discontinuing use may gradually bring back hair fall problems and resume graying.","completion":"The article discusses the benefits of egg oil for hair health, highlighting its revitalizing, anti-aging, and anti-inflammatory properties, while providing a guide on making your own egg oil and its proper application for optimal results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - A natural satellite or moon is, in the most common usage, an astronomical body that orbits a planet or minor planet (or sometimes another Small Solar System Body). - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. - An explosion is a rapid increase in volume and release of energy in an extreme manner, usually with the generation of high temperatures and the release of gases. Supersonic explosions created by high explosives are known as detonations and travel via supersonic shock waves. Subsonic explosions are created by low explosives through a slower burning process known as deflagration. When caused by a man-made device such as an exploding rocket or firework, the audible component of an explosion is referred to as its \\"report\\" (which can also be used as a verb, e.g., \\"the rocket reported loudly upon impact\\".) - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - Mercurius is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northeastern part of the Moon . It lies to the northeast of the smaller crater Carrington , and west - northwest of Zeno . Just to the south is the small lunar mare named Lacus Spei , and to the west is the larger Lacus Temporis . The rim of Mercurius is circular , with a somewhat irregular edge . There are small outward bulges along several sections of the rim , with the most notable bulges being along the eastern and southern sides . The inner wall has slumped around much of the perimeter , producing a sharp edge . The sides are also somewhat worn , with some tiny craterlets overlying the inner wall . Within the rim the interior floor has been resurfaced by lava and is nearly level , with a slight hint of a central mound . The remainder of the floor is marked only by a few tiny craterlets and some low ridges in the northeastern corner . - The lunar maria (singular: mare ) are large, dark, basaltic plains on Earth's Moon, formed by ancient volcanic eruptions. They were dubbed \\"maria\\", Latin for \\"seas\\", by early astronomers who mistook them for actual seas. They are less reflective than the \\"highlands\\" as a result of their iron-rich compositions, and hence appear dark to the naked eye. The maria cover about 16 percent of the lunar surface, mostly on the side visible from Earth. The few maria on the far side are much smaller, residing mostly in very large craters. The traditional nomenclature for the Moon also includes one \\"oceanus\\" (ocean), as well as features with the names \\"lacus\\" (lake), \\"palus\\" (marsh), and \\"sinus\\" (bay). The last three are smaller than maria, but have the same nature and characteristics. - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury. - Hypervelocity is very high velocity, approximately over 3,000 meters per second (6,700 mph, 11,000 km/h, 10,000 ft/s, or Mach 8.8). In particular, hypervelocity is velocity so high that the strength of materials upon impact is very small compared to inertial stresses. Thus, even metals behave like fluids under hypervelocity impact. Extreme hypervelocity results in vaporization of the impactor and target. For structural metals, hypervelocity is generally considered to be over 2,500 m/s (5,600 mph, 9,000 km/h, 8,200 ft/s, or Mach 7.3). Meteorite craters are also examples of hypervelocity impacts. - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. - An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins. - Lacus Spei (latin for \\"Lake of Hope\\") is a small lunar mare that is located in the northeastern part of the Moon's near side. To the north is the crater Mercurius and to the west-southwest lies Schumacher. - Basalt (, , , or ) is a common extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock formed from the rapid cooling of basaltic lava exposed at or very near the surface of a planet or moon. Flood basalt describes the formation in a series of lava basalt flows. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. - Lacus Temporis (Latin for \\"Lake of Time\\") is a small lunar mare that is located in the northeastern quadrant of the Moon's near side. The selenographic coordinates of this feature are , and it lies within a diameter of 117 km. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - Meteor Crater is a meteorite impact crater approximately east of Flagstaff and west of Winslow in the northern Arizona desert of the United States. Because the United States Board on Geographic Names commonly recognizes names of natural features derived from the nearest post office, the feature acquired the name of \\"Meteor Crater\\" from the nearby post office named Meteor. The site was formerly known as the Canyon Diablo Crater and fragments of the meteorite are officially called the Canyon Diablo Meteorite. Scientists refer to the crater as Barringer Crater in honor of Daniel Barringer, who was first to suggest that it was produced by meteorite impact. The crater is privately owned by the Barringer family through their Barringer Crater Company, which proclaims it to be the \\"best preserved meteorite crater on Earth\\".

Intrigued by the doctor's work and sensing his genius, Ygor decides to offer his help. Act 2: The Alliance As Dr. Krieger desperately searches for a way to clear his name and redeem himself, Ygor approaches him and promises to help. Skeptical at first, Dr. Krieger eventually accepts Ygor's offer due to a lack of viable alternative options. Ygor informs the doctor that he has access to a cutting-edge, underground facility where the doctor can continue his genetic research discreetly. Upon arriving at the secret laboratory, Dr. Krieger encounters other brilliant scientists and engineers working on various top-secret endeavours. They, too, have partnered with Ygor for their own reasons. Over time, Dr. Krieger becomes consumed once again by his research, driven by the desire to revolutionize genetic science and ultimately take down the people who slandered him. Act 3: A Sinister Revelation As Dr. Krieger's work progresses, a series of mysterious events and suspicious encounters lead him to question Ygor's motives. The deeper he dives into Ygor's background, the more nefarious his intentions appear to be. Dr. Krieger discovers that Ygor is a powerful and cunning businessman with vast resources and connections in the scientific community. Ygor's scheme involves collecting the work of these exceptional yet vulnerable researchers and marketing it as his own. Feeling betrayed, Dr. Krieger confronts Ygor. However, he's faced with a serious dilemma: expose Ygor and risk losing everything or collaborate in silence to continue his research and reinstate his reputation. Act 4: The Redemption Ultimately, Dr. Krieger chooses to stand up against Ygor. With the help of the other scientists working in Ygor's facility, he uncovers concrete evidence of Ygor's nefarious dealings. Dr. Krieger realizes that it is not just about redeeming himself, but also protecting the future of scientific research from unscrupulous individuals. In the climax, Dr. Krieger and his fellow scientists expose Ygor's true intentions to the public, leading to his arrest.

Fort Ticonderoga (), formerly Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain, in northern New York, in the United States. It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack. Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated...

She frequently appears on television, radio, and as a speaker at public and private events. - Roger Joseph Ebert (June 18, 1942 April 4, 2013) was an American film critic and historian, journalist, screenwriter, and author. He was a film critic for the \\"Chicago Sun-Times\\" from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. - Structural engineering is mainly a sub-division of civil engineering where structural engineers are trained to understand, predict, and calculate the stability, strength and rigidity of built structures for buildings and non-building structures, to develop designs and integrate their design with that of other designers, and to supervise construction of projects on site. They can also be involved in the design of machinery, medical equipment, vehicles etc. where structural integrity affects functioning and safety. - An arch is a curved structure that spans a space and may or may not support weight above it. Arch may be synonymous with vault, but a vault may be distinguished as a continuous arch forming a roof. Arches appeared as early as the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamian brick architecture, and their systematic use started with the Ancient Romans who were the first to apply the technique to a wide range of structures. - News of the Weird is a syndicated newspaper column edited by Chuck Shepherd that collects bizarre news stories. It was created in 1988. , it is syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate and published in more than 250 newspapers in the United States and Canada. As of July 2008, the daily internet column has merged with two other \\"weird\\" websites to form Weird Universe. - Earthquake engineering is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that designs and analyzes structures, such as buildings and bridges, with earthquakes in mind. Its overall goal is to make such structures more resistant to earthquakes. An earthquake (or seismic) engineer aims to construct structures that will not be damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major earthquake. Earthquake engineering is the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels. Traditionally, it has been narrowly defined as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to seismic loading; it is considered as a subset of structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, applied physics, etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of civil engineering, mechanical engineering and from the social sciences, especially sociology, political science, economics and finance. - In the United States, same-sex marriage has been legal in all states, Washington, D.C., as well as all U.S. territories except American Samoa, but not on Indian lands, since June 26, 2015, when the United States Supreme Court ruled in \\"Obergefell v. Hodges\\" that state-level bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional. The court ruled that the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples and the refusal to recognize those marriages performed in other jurisdictions violates the Due Process and the Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The ruling overturned a precedent, \\"Baker v. Nelson\\". - Compression members are structural elements that are pushed together or carry a load, more technically they are subjected only to axial compressive forces. That is, the loads are applied on the longitudinal axis through the centroid of the member cross section, and the load over the cross sectional area gives the stress on the compressed member. In buildings posts and columns are almost always compression members as are the \\"top chord\\" of trusses. - Uclick LLC was an American corporation (a division of Andrews McMeel Universal) selling \\"digital entertainment content\\" for the desktop, the web and mobile phones.

Founded in 1970, it was merged in July 2009 with Uclick (which published its comics on GoComics) to form Universal Uclick. - A column or pillar in architecture and structural engineering is a structural element that transmits, through compression, the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below. In other words, a column is a compression member. The term column applies especially to a large round support (the \\"shaft\\" of the column) with a capital and a \\"base\\" or pedestal and made of stone, or appearing to be so. A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post, and supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers. For the purpose of wind or earthquake engineering, columns may be designed to resist lateral forces. Other compression members are often termed \\"columns\\" because of the similar stress conditions. Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. In architecture, \\"column\\" refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features. A column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes; many columns are \\"engaged\\", that is to say form part of a wall. - Architecture (Latin \\"architectura\\", from the Greek \\"arkhitekton\\" \\"architect\\", from - \\"chief\\" and \\"builder\\") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements. - The National Organization for Marriage (NOM) is an American non-profit political organization established in 2007 to work against the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States. It was formed in 2007 specifically to pass California Proposition 8 prohibiting same-sex marriage in California. The group has opposed civil union legislation and gay adoption, and has fought against allowing transgender individuals to use bathrooms that accord with their gender identity. Brian S.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Because the gravitational field created by the Moon weakens with distance from the Moon, it exerts a slightly stronger than average force on the side of the Earth facing the Moon, and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side. The Moon thus tends to \\"stretch\\" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally. As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium—there is never time for the fluid to \\"catch up\\" to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant—the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height. Now, I have a new situation: Mike was reading about an instrument that could measure gravity, gravimeter. He then found how gravimeter was used to measure the gravitational field of the Moon. He read about two distinct cases where the Moon's gravitational field was measured on earth, side A and side B. In side A the Moon's gravity was measured from the side where the Earth was facing the Moon. And in side B the Moon's gravitational field was measured from the opposite side of the Earth.

Movie title: Raging Bull Context: In a brief scene in 1964, an aging, overweight Italian American, Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro), practices a comedy routine. The rest of the film then occurs in flashback. In 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against Jimmy Reeves, where he received his first loss. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the US Army the following week. By 1947, Jake marries Vikki. Jake constantly worries about Vikki having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto), and Vikki. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vikki approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vikki, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against Billy Fox, after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late.

No; The suggested answer provided is not an accurate response to the question about SATA Power Connectors. Instead, it discusses the industry compatibility standards and the ownership transfer of SATA contents, rather than focusing on the features and purpose of SATA Power Connectors. A more appropriate response to the question would be: SATA Power Connectors are essential components within computer systems, responsible for supplying power to Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) devices, such as hard disk drives (HDDs) and optical drives (CD/DVD/Blu-ray). They are specifically designed to meet the requirements of SATA-based storage devices and ensure reliable power connections. The connectors typically have 15 pins and are larger than the SATA data connectors, with the power connectors measuring 7.5mm x 3mm. The pins are organized into three rows, providing multiple voltages (3.3V, 5V, and 12V) needed by the SATA devices. The presence of different power connections in the 15-pin layout ensures that the devices receive the correct power voltage and current. Additionally, SATA Power Connectors have incorporated features, such as hot-swapping capabilities, which allow SATA devices to be connected or disconnected without turning off the system. In summary, the focus of the answer should be on the purpose, design, and functionality of the SATA Power Connectors rather than on the industry bodies overseeing SATA standards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval.

His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a question and a context passage. You have to answer the question based on the given passage. Q: What effect did this have on the coffers?, Context: In 1374 King Louis of Hungary approved the Privilege of Koszyce (Polish: \\"przywilej koszycki\\" or \\"ugoda koszycka\\") in Košice in order to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter Jadwiga. He broadened the definition of who was a member of the nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax (łanowy, which was limited to 2 grosze from łan (an old measure of land size)). In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was abolished; no new taxes could be raised without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, also, district offices (Polish: \\"urzędy ziemskie\\") were reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights. Finally, this privilege obliged the King to pay indemnities to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders. A:","completion":"The effect of the Privilege of Koszyce on the coffers was significant as it imposed several financial limitations on the king. Firstly, it broadened the definition of nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax, reducing the overall tax income. Secondly, it limited the łanowy tax to 2 grosze from łan, further restricting the income from taxes. Thirdly, it abolished the King's right to raise taxes unilaterally, making it necessary to get the agreement of the nobility for any new taxes. Lastly, it required the King to pay indemnities to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside of Polish borders, adding an additional financial burden. Overall, these changes led to a decrease in the funds available to the king and impacted the financial stability of the kingdom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You be the judge CLOSE In response to a question about Trump appearing to slur a few words at the end of his speech on recognizing Jerusalem, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump will undergo the exam at Walter Reed Medical Center. Time After President Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital on Wednesday, many on social media couldn't help but notice that the president slurred his speech towards the end of his announcement. \\"Thank you, God bless you, God bless Israel, God bless the Palestinians, and God bless the United States,\\" Trump said at the end of his speech, with Twitterverse pointing out that he mispronounced \\"States.\\" Listeners, including actress Mia Farrow, expressed their concerns and questioned his health state.

The Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643), in addition to a large output of church music and madrigals, wrote prolifically for the stage. His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists. Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation. Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to have survived. The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida... Answer:","completion":"Monteverdi"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas?, using the article: Tosca is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa. It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on Victorien Sardou's 1887 French-language dramatic play, La Tosca, is a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples's control of Rome threatened by Napoleon's invasion of Italy. It contains depictions of torture, murder and suicide, as well as some of Puccini's best-known lyrical arias. Puccini saw Sardou's play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public. Musically, Tosca is structured as a through-composed work, with arias, recitative, choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas. While critics have often dismissed the opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot—musicologist Joseph Kerman called it a \\"shabby little shocker\\"—the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic force of Tosca and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and audiences, and the work remains one of the most frequently performed operas. Many recordings of the work have been issued, both of studio and live performances., what would be the answer ?","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What is the first name of the person who used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas?\\" would be Giacomo. The person who used Wagnerian leitmotifs in this context is Giacomo Puccini, the composer of the opera Tosca. According to the provided article, Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs in this opera to identify characters, objects, and ideas. Wagnerian leitmotifs, named after the German composer Richard Wagner who extensively used this musical technique, is a brief, recurring musical phrase associated with a particular character, place, thing, or idea in a piece of music, especially in operas. Leitmotif technique provides a musical representation for different characters or themes, enabling audiences to associate these motifs with their corresponding elements within the story, even as they evolve over time. In specific relation to Tosca, Giacomo Puccini applied this method in his composition and arrangement of the score. Despite some criticisms on its plot integrity, Tosca is acknowledged for the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration, with the utilisation of leitmotifs being a significant contributing factor. The melodrama unfolds with characters, objects and ideas being represented and identified through unique recurring musical phrases, adding depth and complexity to the overall narrative. This technique enhances the expressive impact of the music, correlating specific motifs with unfolding drama, thereby heightening emotional engagement for the audience.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation 0 = 31*t + 232 - 77 for t, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation. Combine like terms on the right side of the equation: 0 = 31*t + (232 - 77) 0 = 31*t + 155 Step 2: Isolate the variable (t) on one side of the equation. To do this, move the constant term (155) to the left side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides: 0 - 155 = 31*t -155 = 31*t Step 3: Solve for t. Now, you want to get t by itself, so you need to divide both sides of the equation by 31: -155 / 31 = 31*t / 31 -5 = t So, the value of t that solves the equation 0 = 31*t + 232 - 77 is t = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: when did be more chill musical come out?? Answer:","completion":"\\"Be More Chill\\" is a musical with music and lyrics by Joe Iconis and a book by Joe Tracz. It is based on the 2004 novel of the same name by Ned Vizzini. The musical made its world premiere at the Two River Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey in 2015. This first production ran from May 30 to June 21, 2015. Despite a mixed critical reception, the show quickly gained a cult following online, largely thanks to its cast recording which was released on October 30, 2015. Released into the world of digital music, the recording popularized the show among a new generation of theater fans. The viral growth led to a number of productions of the musical taking place around the world, as its fan base continued to expand. Due to its popularity, an Off-Broadway production was announced and began previews at the Irene Diamond Stage at the Signature Theatre on July 26, 2018, officially opening on August 9, 2018. This production was directed by Stephen Brackett and choreographed by Chase Brock. Following its Off-Broadway run, \\"Be More Chill\\" transferred to Broadway, opening for previews at the Lyceum Theatre on February 13, 2019, with its official opening taking place on March 10, 2019. The Broadway production was short-lived, however, closing on August 11, 2019. Despite the shortness of its run, the musical had left a significant mark on fans and the broader musical theatre world. Afterward, the production toured across the United States and internationally, which ensured the musical continued to reach and impact new audiences. Overall, \\"Be More Chill\\" has had a fascinating and somewhat unconventional journey to and through its Broadway run.

Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Life expectancy at birth. In the context of the Human Development Index (HDI), which is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and income per capita indicators, one of the tiers besides education and income per capita is life expectancy at birth. Life expectancy at birth is a measure of how long a newborn is expected to live, on average, given the current health conditions, mortality rates, and quality of healthcare in a particular country. Higher life expectancy generally implies a longer and healthier life for the individuals living in a country. A longer life expectancy allows people to have more opportunities for personal and professional growth, increased well-being, and an overall better quality of life. This is why life expectancy is one of the three key indicators used in the HDI for ranking countries and determining their level of human development. The HDI, developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq and published by the United Nations Development Programme, assesses countries across these three primary indicators to understand people's ability to \\"be\\" and \\"do\\" desirable things in their lives. By considering life expectancy at birth alongside education and income per capita, the HDI provides a more comprehensive understanding of a country's development and overall living conditions than any single indicator could offer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And they will not give you a pickup window until the morning of the pick up.

The review offers a positive experience of donating items through the Salvation Army's pickup service, highlighting the navigability of the website, the convenience of scheduling a pickup online, and the efficiency of the pickup team in removing items from the apartment.

Wetting your hands makes the rice less sticky while you work with it so it stays on the seaweed instead of your fingers. Following this step, you will then need to: 1. Prepare the sushi rice: Rinse the sushi rice under cold running water until the water runs clear. Combine the rinsed rice with an equal amount of water and cook in a rice cooker or on the stovetop according to package instructions. Once the rice is cooked, gently fold in sushi vinegar (a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt) and set aside to cool to room temperature. 2. Prepare the ingredients: For a traditional California roll, you'll need cooked crab or imitation crab meat, sliced cucumber, and sliced avocado. Make sure all ingredients are sliced into long, thin strips for easy assembly. 3. Assembly: Starting at the bottom edge of the seaweed sheet, spread a thin, even layer of sushi rice across the seaweed, leaving about 1-2 cm of space at the top to seal the roll. Lay the crab, cucumber, and avocado slices horizontally across the middle of the rice layer, ensuring each ingredient extends to the edges of the seaweed. 4. Rolling: Using the sushi rolling mat, start with the edge closest to you and gently roll the seaweed, rice, and fillings into a tight cylinder, applying pressure to keep the roll compact. Be sure not to roll the mat itself into the sushi. As you reach the end of the roll, moisten the exposed seaweed strip with some water to create a seal. 5. Cutting: Using a sharp, wet knife, slice the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces, about 2 cm thick. Regularly clean and wet the knife to ensure smooth and clean cuts through the sushi roll. 6. Serving: Arrange the California roll slices on a serving plate with a small dish of soy sauce for dipping, a portion of pickled ginger to cleanse the palate, and a dab of wasabi for added heat, if desired. Enjoy your homemade California rolls with chopsticks or just your fingers! Remember to practice patience and persistence when making sushi rolls, as it will take time to master the perfect roll.

The charity is also advertising for a second fitter, in Swansea. The launch of the north Wales service was held in Wrexham on Tuesday. It is open to anyone who has served or is currently serving in the armed forces as well as widows, widowers, co-habiting partners and civil partners. Typical jobs carried out range from changing light bulbs and tap washers; putting up shelves, curtain rails and grab rails; fitting smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors; and fitting and changing door locks and other security features.

As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century. contains an answer for the question: Which kingdom had their king baptized in 580?, what is it ? A:","completion":"The kingdom that had their king baptized in 580 was Alodia. In John of Ephesus' account, the Alodian King became aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and requested a bishop to baptize his people. Consequently, in 580, the Alodian King, his family, and the local nobility were baptized, leading to the Christianization of Alodia.

Please answer the following question: Joel has just started his first day working as a scientist in a laboratory. The first task he was given is to look at two atoms and to jot down as much information about the two as he can. First, he needs to come up with an identification for these atoms. Since he is new, he decides to keep it professional and simply call the larger of the two atoms \\"atom L\\" and the smaller one \\"atom S\\". Now that he's taken care of that he can get down to work. Is the shielding effect in atom S higher or lower than in atom L? Hint: The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. This is particularly easy to see in the alkali metals, where the single valence electron is shielded by all of the inner core electrons. Answer:","completion":"To determine whether the shielding effect in atom S is higher or lower than in atom L, let's follow these steps and analyze the given information: Step 1: Understand the shielding effect. The shielding effect refers to the decrease in the effective nuclear charge experienced by the valence electrons due to the presence of inner electrons, which causes a reduction in the attractive force between the valence electrons and the nucleus. Step 2: Consider the hint provided. The hint states that the ionization energies of representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. As the size of the atom increases, the valence electron being removed is further from the nucleus, resulting in a lower ionization energy due to the weakened attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus. Step 3: Relate the hint to the shielding effect. The hint also states that although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. Step 4: Apply the information to atoms L and S. Atom L is larger than atom S. Based on the hint, a larger atom has a higher shielding effect due to the increased presence of inner electrons, which limits the attractive force between valence electrons and the nucleus. Conclusion: The shielding effect in atom S is lower than in atom L."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

What are the reasons for anemia? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Choices: A). no B). yes","completion":"A) No, hemophilia and anemia are not the same, but they can be related in some cases. Hemophilia and anemia are both blood-related disorders; however, they have distinct differences in their underlying causes and effects on the body. Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder that primarily affects males and is characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction in one of the proteins that help the blood to clot, known as clotting factors. There are different types of hemophilia, classified according to which clotting factor is deficient or affected, with the two most common types being hemophilia A (deficiency in clotting factor VIII) and hemophilia B (deficiency in clotting factor IX). Hemophilia results in prolonged and spontaneous bleeding, either externally (from injuries and cuts) or internally (into joints, muscles, or organs). Treatment for hemophilia typically involves the administration of the missing clotting factor in the form of a concentrate or recombinant product. Anemia, on the other hand, is a general term for a condition where the body does not have enough red blood cells (RBCs) or the RBCs do not function properly. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds to oxygen and allows the RBCs to transport oxygen throughout the body. A lack of functional RBCs results in lower oxygen-carrying capacity and can cause fatigue, pale skin, shortness of breath, and various other symptoms. There are several types and causes of anemia: 1. Iron-deficiency anemia: This is the most common type of anemia, caused by a lack of sufficient iron in the body. Iron is a critical component of hemoglobin, and without enough iron, the body cannot produce enough hemoglobin to maintain adequate RBC function. Potential reasons for iron deficiency include poor diet, the body's reduced ability to absorb iron, or blood loss (either from injury, menstruation, or gastrointestinal bleeding). 2. Vitamin-deficiency anemia: A deficiency in vitamin B12 or folic acid can lead to anemia because these vitamins are necessary for the production of red blood cells. Reasons for these deficiencies may include poor diet, malabsorption disorders, or medications that affect absorption. 3. Hemolytic anemia: This type of anemia occurs when RBCs are destroyed prematurely, leading to a decrease in RBC lifespan and a shortage of RBCs. Hemolytic anemia can be caused by various factors such as autoimmune diseases, infections, or inherited conditions like sickle cell anemia or thalassemia. 4. Aplastic anemia: Aplastic anemia is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the body fails to produce enough RBCs due to damage or failure of the bone marrow (the tissue responsible for producing blood cells). Causes of aplastic anemia can include exposure to radiation, certain medications, autoimmune diseases, or inherited conditions. 5. Anemia of chronic disease: Some chronic inflammations or long-term diseases can lead to the development of anemia, such as kidney disease, cancer, or rheumatoid arthritis. To summarize, hemophilia and anemia are related insofar as they are both blood-related disorders with distinct causes, manifestations, and treatments. Hemophilia mainly focuses on the clotting factor deficiencies affecting the blood's ability to clot and is caused by genetic factors, while anemia is characterized by a lack of functional red blood cells or a lower oxygen-carrying capacity, and can have a wide range of underlying causes."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

It warns you that there are three common scenarios including individuals' beliefs matching or not matching reality, or false assumptions about others' beliefs. These scenarios might make answering the question harder. Additionally, the instructions caution that there are 'distractor sentences' throughout the story that aren't relevant to the answer. The steps to solve this task are as follows: Step 1: Read the story - it’s important to read carefully since it shares a lot of information that may or may not be relevant. Step 2: Identify the distractor sentences. These sentences might not have any direct impact on the question being asked. For instance, \\"Mason entered the office\\" doesn't appear to pertain to the location of the pumpkin. Step 3: Identify the object in question, which is the pumpkin in this case. Step 4: Follow the journey of the object in the story. Here, it's first stated that \\"The pumpkin is in the blue_crate.\\" The story ends with \\"William moved the pumpkin to the green_suitcase.\\" Step 5: Use information from step 4 to answer the question \\"Where is the pumpkin really?\\" Following these steps, you can conclude the pumpkin is really in the green suitcase since William moved it there."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I got out of bed knowing I am going to commit suicide.I don't know where, but I do know how. I didn't want to do it at home. I printed out my suicide notes for everybody and hid it somewhere in my room. As I got ready, I took one last glanced to my dad. I gathered all my medications shoved it in to my bag and went out outside caught the bus that goes to college. I had no plans on going into my classes; I sat onto the college bus stop contemplating if I am going to do it. I did it. I chugged down the whole bottle of my anti-depressant. I closed my eyes for a brief moment, I felt like I was about to faint; I checked my phone to see what time was it and I saw my daughter's face on my home screen. I said to myself, \\"How can you be so stupid?! You have a daughter!\\" Trying my best to be conscious I caught the bus that goes to the hospital and checked in as a crisis patient in need to see a psychiatrist right away.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Will Games help Scotland's flower bloom? Scotland may not have qualified for the World Cup in Brazil, but Glasgow is gearing-up for what could be one of the most significant sporting events in Scottish history. The Commonwealth Games will be officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on July 23 and there are much more than medals at stake. This event has taken on added significance because it will be followed a few weeks later by the referendum on Scottish independence. The two are so close together that it is impossible to separate sport from politics. Scottish Nationalists are pinning their hopes on a successful Games to generate a burst of national pride that will give them momentum in the polls and a ‘Yes’ majority. You can already feel the excitement beginning to build around the city. Paula Speirs, a mother of two, is among more than 50,000 people to have volunteered their services. \\"I love sport and having such a huge sporting event in my home city is something I wanted to be part of. Glasgow is starting to really come alive with all things Games,\\" she said, \\"I was so delighted when I got my email to offer me a Clyde-sider role and thrilled to be selected. I'm even looking forward to six days of 7.30am starts!\\" In contrast to the unifying experience of the London Olympics, the Commonwealth Games also sets Scotland and England against each other. In a sporting manifestation of a possible political future, the two countries compete independently under their own colours with their own teams. This also provides the Scottish government with an opportunity. Scotland’s first minister, Alex Salmond, was famously pictured 'photo-bombing' Wimbledon, waving Scotland's flag in the stand when Andy Murray, a Scot, won the championship. We can expect a lot more of that kind of thing in Glasgow. The most high-profile events will take place at Hampden Park. The stadium, which has been temporarily converted from football to athletics, is a place of tribal intensity. Former council leader Steven Purcell helped to bring the Commonwealth Games to Glasgow. He is hoping that this event will be much more celebratory and welcoming than the deadly seriousness that accompanies football in Scotland. \\"Glasgow is a famously friendly city and it will be a privilege to welcome world-class performers like Jessica Ennis and Mo Farah,\\" he said. \\"I believe that Scotland is more confident about itself now and I want to see everyone who competes here, including athletes from England, get a huge cheer from the Hampden crowd.\\" Nobody can predict with confidence how the Glasgow crowd will respond when the UK’s national anthem 'God Save the Queen' is played during medal ceremonies. The Commonwealth Games might also show how politics can be shaped by unintended consequences. Purcell is a member of the pro-UK Labour Party. By bringing the event to Glasgow, he could end up being one of the people most responsible for helping 'yes' to victory.

Shares AMSTERDAM, Netherlands, Oct 11 – The Netherlands failed to reach the 2018 World Cup finals as they could only beat Sweden 2-0 on Tuesday when they needed an unlikely 7-0 victory. Elimination is fresh humiliation for the nation that reached the 2010 World Cup final and the semi-finals four years later, after they also missed out on Euro 2016 qualification. Can we infer the following? Soccer is boring and scores very little points","completion":"The statement \\"Soccer is boring and scores very little points\\" is a subjective opinion and cannot be inferred from the given information regarding the Netherlands failing to reach the 2018 World Cup finals and their previous successes in 2010 and 2014. It is true that soccer, or football as it is known in most parts of the world, is a sport in which scoring is generally low compared to other sports. However, this does not mean that soccer is inherently boring or uneventful. Rather, it is important to understand various aspects of the sport that contribute to its global popularity and the excitement it generates. Firstly, soccer is a fast-paced sport wherein teams must constantly adapt to various in-game situations. The lack of frequent stoppages and constant action in soccer adds to the excitement of the game. Soccer matches are played in two 45-minute halves, with limited interruptions, which allows for a continuous flow of play. This flow can create tense and thrilling situations throughout a match, even if scoring is relatively rare. Secondly, the lower scoring nature of soccer places a higher emphasis on the importance of each goal. As a result, scoring opportunities and goals carry a certain weight and significance that may not be present in other sports with higher scoring. This often results in intense efforts from both teams trying to capitalize on every potential scoring chance, resulting in a high level of competitiveness and excitement for fans. Additionally, soccer is a globally popular sport that attracts millions of fans due to its accessibility, simplicity, and diverse range of talented players and teams. The sport transcends cultural, linguistic, and geographical boundaries, creating a shared global interest. This shared interest generates a vibrant atmosphere in stadiums and watching parties, where fans come together to support their respective teams, adding to the excitement of the matches. Furthermore, soccer has a rich history and iconic moments, from thrilling goals to monumental upsets that have captivated the world. The sport has produced numerous legendary players and teams that have inspired generations of fans. These moments add layers of emotion and passion to the sport, creating narratives that contribute to the overall appeal of soccer. Lastly, major international tournaments, such as the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship, add a competitive element and a sense of national pride to the sport. These events captivate entire countries and bring a sense of unity between people who may otherwise have little in common. In conclusion, while it is accurate to say that soccer generally experiences lower scoring in comparison to certain other sports, it is not valid to infer that the sport is boring as a direct result. The excitement and appeal of soccer rely on a multitude of factors, including its fast pace, global popularity, rich history, and high-stakes competitions. Soccer is a beloved sport for millions of fans worldwide, and the low scoring nature of the game only adds to the suspense and significance of each goal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Osceola was named Billy Powell at birth in 1804 in the Creek village of Talisi. now known as Tallassee, Alabama, in current Elmore County. \\"The people in the town of Tallassee...were mixed-blood Native American/English/Irish/Scottish, and some were black. Billy was all of these.\\" After Osceola's death, army doctor Frederick Weedon persuaded the Seminole to allow him to make a death mask of Osceola, this being a European-American custom at the time for prominent people. Later he removed Osceola's head and embalmed it. For some time, Weedon kept the head and a number of personal objects Osceola had given him. Later, Weedon gave the head to his son-in-law Daniel Whitehurst. In 1843, Whitehurst sent the head to Valentine Mott, a New York physician. Mott placed it in his collection at the Surgical and Pathological Museum. It was presumably lost when a fire destroyed the museum in 1866. Some of Osceola's belongings are still held by the Weedon family, while others have disappeared. Captain Pitcairn Morrison sent the death mask and some other objects collected by Weedon to an army officer in Washington. By 1885, the death mask and some of Osceola's belongings had arrived in the anthropology collection of the Smithsonian Institution, where they are still held. In 1966, Miami businessman Otis W. Shriver claimed he had dug up Osceola's grave and put his bones into a bank vault to rebury them at a tourist site at the Rainbow Springs. Shriver traveled around the state in 1967 to gather support for his project. Archaeologists later proved that Shriver had dug up animal remains; Osceola's body was still in its coffin. In 1979 the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma bought Osceola's bandolier and other personal items from a Sotheby's auction. Because of the chief's significance, over time some people have created forgeries of Osceola's belongings. Rumors persist that his embalmed head has been found in various locations. Did Weedon keep the mask?","completion":"No, Weedon did not keep the mask.

All of his fortune will be spent on helping poor Chinese students get a better education. And Yu isn't the only super-rich person in China who has this spirit of giving. Chen Guangbiao, a Jiangsu recycling tycoon, has given millions of dollars to charity and promises to give all of his money to charity when he dies. Yu and Chen are among the many businessmen who have become prosperous during China's economic rise. An American business magazine, Forbes, estimates that there are 117 billionaires in China and hundreds of thousands of millionaires. What sets Yu and Chen apart from the rest, though, is their tremendous generosity(,) when it comes to donating money to charity. Last week Bill Gates and Warren Buffett came to Beijing. Gates and Buffett, two of the world's richest men, are also the world's biggest philanthropists. They invited fifty of China's richest people to have dinner with them and talk about the spirit of giving. At first, only a few people accepted their invitation. It seemed some of the invited guests were afraid that Buffett and Gates were going to pressure them into giving their wealth to charity. A lot of people are angry at the billionaires who are not willing to give away their fortunes. They _ hem for being miserly and not caring about the poor and the less fortunate. But I think this criticism is wrong. A gift, any gift, should come from the heart. Instead of criticism, these reluctant billionaires should be encouraged to follow the examples of Yu Pengnian and Chen Guangbiao. Encouragement is always a better strategy than criticism. As we say in English, \\"You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.\\" Question: According to passage, why does the author end the passage with the English saying \\"You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar\\"? Options: A: The author wants to tell us that flies prefer honey to vinegar. B: The author wants to prove that encouragement is always a better strategy than criticism when it comes to charity. C: The English saying expresses the main theme of the passage.

Question: If Mona owns a greenhouse and she decides to cover the top up to restrict sunlight, what happens to her plant's ability to make food increases or decreases? A:","completion":"If Mona owns a greenhouse and decides to cover the top up to restrict sunlight, her plant's ability to make food would decrease. This is because photosynthesis, which is the process through which plants and phytoplankton produce food, relies heavily on exposure to sunlight. Sunlight provides the necessary energy for plants to undergo photosynthesis and produce essential sugars used for growth and sustenance. By covering the top of the greenhouse, Mona would be reducing the amount of sunlight, and therefore, the amount of available energy for her plants' photosynthesis process. With less sunlight reaching her plants, they would be less capable of producing the needed food to grow and thrive. As a result, the overall productivity and health of her plants would suffer due to the decrease in the food production process. In summary, if Mona covers the top of her greenhouse to restrict sunlight, her plant's ability to make food would decrease, potentially leading to slower growth rates, reduced health, and lower overall plant productivity within the greenhouse environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: In other words, do the things you want your children to do. If you direct your children to be on time for appointments or be at home at a certain time, you should also arrive when you say you are going to. If you don’t want your child to use foul language, don’t curse. If you want your children to tell the truth, don’t lie to them or others. Even if you advise your children to do the right thing, they will not admire you if you are hypocritical. . Children will not admire an inflexible tyrant. Including your child in discussions which affect them will gain their admiration and help them develop a sense of personal autonomy and agency. You can include your child in both small and large decisions. For instance, a few nights a week you could ask your child what he or she wants for dinner. (Naturally, if they answer something unacceptable like ice cream, you should tell them that is not an option.) Including your child in family decisions doesn’t mean relinquishing all responsibility for those decisions. You’re still the parent and ultimately, authority still rests with you. Go for walks, go to the movies, and go to get ice cream together. Enjoy the time you spend with them. Tell your child regularly that you love them. When they come home after school, ask “How was your day?” Ask about their dreams, ideas, and feelings. For instance, your child says, “I want to be a dancer when I grow up,” you could ask, “Why do you want to be a dancer?” Listen to their answers and don’t belittle what they have to say. If you need more information, ask follow-up questions. Take time to seriously answer any questions your child asks. Show your child know that you will always be there for them. If they need help with homework or if they are sick, take time out of your schedule to care for them. Recognize that nobody is perfect. If you make a mistake, you should acknowledge that you did so and apologize for hurting anyone’s feelings. Find ways to amend the situation and think about what you can do next time to prevent a similar situation from occurring. Use these situations to illustrate to your child how to admit when you’re wrong and ask for forgiveness. For instance, if you mistook your child’s drawing a of a bird for a butterfly, your child might feel distraught. Admit that you made a mistake by identifying it wrongly and reassure them that it is a great drawing. Say, “I’m sorry, can you forgive me?” When your children make mistakes, you should always expect them to acknowledge the mistake. Your child should apologize and correct the situation as needed. For instance, if they spilled milk on the floor while you were out of the room, ensure that they admit to doing so and then help you clean it up (assuming they are of an appropriate age to do so). Tell your child you love them even when they make mistakes. If you always have something interesting to teach or explain to your child, they will be much impressed and admire you for your depth of knowledge. Having a well-rounded education will not only equip you for a richer life, but it will also demonstrate to your child that education should be an important part of their life, as well. If you did not graduate high school, consider getting your GED. If you did graduate high school, consider going to college. You could get a two-year associate’s degree or a four-year bachelor’s degree. You don’t need a college education to be well-educated or interested in learning, though it does help. Keep up with current events by reading the newspaper regularly. Visit your local library to check out some books. Read a mix of both fiction and nonfiction. Watch documentaries as well as feature films. Expand your mind by diving deeper into topics you know little about. By challenging yourself, you will be able to think about things in a different way. By taking your child to local art museums, you can learn together. If you lose your job, fall ill, or suffer another misfortune, do not mope about it. Instead, take proactive action to correct the situation. For instance, if you lose your job, seek new work in the classifieds of your local paper or online. Use labor networking sites like LinkedIn and Monster.com to make your resume available for potential employers and browse available jobs. Develop patience and control your anger when you feel it rising within you. Do not take your frustration about a difficult situation out on your child or anyone else. Find positive ways to deal with your frustration through deep breathing, yoga, mediation, or engaging yourself with a fun hobby. While it is natural to feel depressed when confronted with loss of a family member or other hardship, stay strong and positive for your child. Talk to a trained therapist if your feelings persist.

Parents should exhibit the behavior they want their children to follow, include their children in decision-making processes, and spend quality time with them.

Carrie Fisher’s death could be a windfall for Disney. The entertainment company, the distributor of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” and the next two films in the franchise, could receive 50 million thanks to an insurance policy the company took out in the event Fisher was unable to fulfill her three-film contract. It’s set to be the largest single personal accident insurance claim payout ever, according to Insurance Insider. Fisher reprised her career-making role of Princess Leia from the original 1977 “Star Wars” flick for the new trilogy. “The Force Awakens,” released in December 2015, made 2.068 billion at the box office worldwide. Filming on “Episode VIII” was already complete at the time of Fisher’s death on Dec. 27 at the age of 60, after she suffered a heart attack aboard a flight from London to Los Angeles. Fisher was due to appear in “Episode IX,” forcing the film’s creators to either rewrite the plot or possibly use visual effects to insert her in the film. The latter was implemented for “Rogue One,” in which the late Peter Cushing reprised his role as Grand Moff Tarkin. It’s unclear if a similar insurance policy was taken out on Fisher’s co-star, Mark Hamill. An autopsy Friday determined Fisher’s cause of death was “not obvious” and that further testing will be required, TMZ reported. Fisher’s mother, Debbie Reynolds, passed away the day after her daughter’s death. She was 84 years old. Hamill gave his first extended interview after the mother-daughter pair’s passing, calling the two “mothering types, both opinionated and determined.” “I can’t think of [Fisher] in the past tense. I think of her in the present tense, in the future tense,” Hamill told Entertainment Weekly. “I’m angry and so sad.” ||||| Recent news: Lloyd’s braced for 50mn Carrie Fisher Star Wars claim Adam McNestrie, Dan Ascher and Matthew Neill 30 December 2016 Insurers at Lloyd's of London look set to pay out a significant contingency claim following the tragic death of Star Wars actress Carrie Fisher, The Insurance Insider can reveal. Sources said that Disney had taken out 50mn of so-called contract protection cover as insurance for the event that Fisher was unable to fulfil her obligations to act in the new Star Wars films, with the policy now likely to trigger. The policy was underwritten by specialist New Jersey-based managing general agent Exceptional Risk Advisors, but if the policy triggers the loss will be entirely borne by capacity providers in Lloyd's, with Enstar subsidiary Atrium the lead on the facility. Sources said that the claim would be widely spread within the Lloyd's contingency market, with more than 20 carriers on the binder. However, the loss would cause substantial damage to the 2016 underwriting result for the segment, with some Lloyd's insurers writing contingency books with 10mn or less of annual premiums. Fisher died on Tuesday (27 December), four days after she suffered a heart attack on a flight between London and Los Angeles. The actress rose to prominence in the late 1970s, playing Princess Leia in the first Star Wars trilogy. She reprised the role last year in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, a runaway success which took 2.07bn at the box office. Filming for Star Wars Episode VIII, which will be released next year, was completed ahead of Fisher's death. Princess Leia was again slated to have a major role in Episode IX and it is not clear how Disney, which owns the Star Wars franchise, will choose to respond. According to its website, Exceptional Risk Advisors is a specialist in high-limit specialty life, accident, and disability products, with underwriting authorities from Lloyd's insurers that exceed 50mn per individual risk. Fisher's spokesperson could not be reached. Atrium declined to comment. Exceptional Risk Advisors and Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Carrie Fisher's death could result in a 50 million insurance payout for Disney, due to an insurance policy the company took out in case Fisher was unable to fulfill her three-film contract for the Star Wars franchise.

The coalition said no operations had been conducted near the embassy. Saudi Arabia recently cut ties with Iran after its embassy in Tehran was attacked by protesters angry at the Saudi execution of a key Shia cleric. The regional rivals back opposing sides in Yemen - Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of supporting the Shia Houthis militarily. Tehran denies this. The Saudi-US-Iran triangle: How crisis reflects deeply fractured Middle East Great rivalry explained: Why don't Iran and Saudi Arabia get along? Spiralling tensions: Why crisis is \\"most dangerous for decades\\" Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr: Who was leading Saudi Shia cleric? A statement by the Saudi-led coalition on Thursday said Iran's allegations were \\"false and that no operations were carried out around the embassy or near to it\\". It said its investigation \\"also confirms the embassy building is safe and has not been damaged\\". Residents and witnesses in Sanaa had also earlier reported there was no damage to the main embassy building. Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Hossein Jaber Ansari had accused Saudi Arabia of a \\"deliberate action\\" in \\"violation of all international conventions that protect diplomatic missions\\". He spoke of damage to the building and injuries to staff. Later, Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said: \\"During an air raid by Saudi Arabia against Sanaa, a rocket fell near our embassy and unfortunately one of our guards was seriously wounded.\\" He added: \\"We will inform the Security Council of the details of this attack.\\" Ever since the Saudi-led air campaign began against Yemen's Houthi rebels last March, there was always a risk that the cold war between the region's two big rivals, Saudi Arabia and Iran, could ignite into something more serious. The Saudis accuse Iran of smuggling in arms by sea to equip the Shia Houthis, who retain control over the capital and much of the country. Saudi officials have even claimed that Iranian military commanders are on the ground there, helping to direct the Houthis. Both Iran and the Houthis deny this. The reality is that the Houthis owe most of their military gains to support from renegade Yemeni army units loyal to ousted ex-President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Saudi Arabia's military spokesman says its coalition has asked for precise co-ordinates of foreign embassies in the Yemeni capital so it can avoid hitting them. Angry as the Saudis are about the ransacking of their embassy in Tehran, it would have been a major escalation if they had carried out a deliberate, direct hit on Iran's embassy in retaliation. It is not clear whether the Iranian embassy was fully functioning, but a number of countries have withdrawn their staff or relocated missions to the port city of Aden in the past year. Although the incident may turn out to be less serious than initially feared, the BBC's Arab Affairs Editor Sebastian Usher says the growing row between Saudi Arabia and Iran could derail peace efforts in Syria and Iraq, as well as in Yemen. The row began after Saudi Arabia executed Shia cleric, Nimr al-Nimr for \\"terrorism offences\\" After the Saudi embassy was attacked, Saudi Arabia severed relations with Iran. A number of Saudi allies then followed suit in taking diplomatic action against Tehran. At least 2,795 civilians have been killed in Yemen since March, when the Saudi-led coalition began a military campaign to restore the government and drive back the Houthis and allied security personnel loyal to ex-President Saleh. In the past six months, coalition and pro-government forces have retaken Aden, but the rebels still control the capital. The already dire humanitarian situation has also deteriorated, with more than 21 million people - four-fifths of the population - now requiring aid.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at Sissinghurst in the Weald of Kent in England, was created by Vita Sackville-West, poet and writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The garden design is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \\"garden rooms\\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual \\"garden rooms\\", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist Tony Lord describing it as \\"the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.\\"The site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the Middle Ages.

Summarize: Write each vocabulary word in a sentence that gives contextual clues to the word’s meaning. Contextual clues are words and phrases around an unknown word that point to the word’s meaning. For example, if the vocabulary word is “succinct,” you might write, “Julia gave a succinct presentation and the meeting was over in no time.” Remember that contextual clues can be misleading. For example, the sentence “As he rushed out the door, Chris felt reluctant to meet his friend,” could imply that “reluctant” means Chris was rushing to see his friend because he was excited or rushing because he was nervous and apprehensive. Using the contextual clues you’ve provided, let your students brainstorm each word’s meaning. Letting your students brainstorm will get their mental juices flowing and they’ll be more primed to remember the meaning of the words later on. Once they’ve had a chance to think about the word on their own, you should tell them what it really means. You can read them the dictionary definition, but it’s more important to present the word in a way that your students will connect with. Use your students’ experience of the world to explain the word. For example, if the word is “hodgepodge,” pull out a plastic crate of different colored markers and “this is a hodgepodge of markers. A hodgepodge is a confusing mix of different things all thrown together.” Students learn words more quickly if they can connect them to images. Come up with different ways to represent a word using imagery. For example, if the word is “interstellar,” talk to them about the vast space between the stars and explain, “’interstellar’ is the word for that space.” If the word is something more abstract, like “repercussions,” show them pictures of children who were sent to their rooms without supper or pictures of people in jail.","completion":"To help your students understand the meaning of vocabulary words through contextual clues, it is essential to create sentences that provide hints about the word's definition. Here is a detailed approach to teaching vocabulary words using contextual clues, brainstorming, real-world examples, and visual aids. Step 1: Choose vocabulary words Select a list of vocabulary words that you would like your students to learn. These words can be from a reading assignment, subject-specific, or simply a list of words you think would be beneficial for them to know. Step 2: Craft sentences with contextual clues For each vocabulary word, create a sentence that provides contextual clues to its meaning. Avoid misleading contextual clues to prevent confusion. Here are some examples: 1. Altruistic: Despite having little money herself, Maria made an altruistic gesture by donating to the charity. 2. Nebulous: Steve's explanation of the project was nebulous, leaving the team unsure of what their roles were. 3. Serendipity: When Jane found an old coin in her backyard, she called it a serendipity. 4. Placate: The father tried to placate his crying child with a toy from the store. 5. Quandary: Faced with two highly appealing job offers, Alicia found herself in a quandary. Step 3: Brainstorm with students Introduce each sentence to your students and let them brainstorm the meaning of the vocabulary word using the contextual clues. Allow them time to discuss their ideas and guesses amongst themselves. Step 4: Reveal the meaning After your students had a chance to think about the word on their own, reveal the actual definition. Present the word in a way that connects with their experiences and enables them to relate to it. Step 5: Provide real-world examples Share real-world examples that illustrate the meaning of the word and help your students better understand its context. This could be current events, situations from popular media, or even examples from their own lives. Step 6: Use visual aids Show students images that represent the vocabulary words. This can be especially helpful for abstract concepts or words that might be difficult for them to visualize. Find creative ways to connect the images with the words to reinforce their meaning and help with retention. By following this approach, your students will have a better understanding of the vocabulary words and be more likely to remember their meanings. Creating sentences with contextual clues, allowing for brainstorming, presenting real-world examples, and using visual imagery help solidify these words in your students' minds and improve their overall vocabulary skills."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The products I’ve been trying out are Yes to Grapefruit Rejuvenating Body Wash* and Yes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo and Pampering Conditioner*. Yes to Grapefruit Rejuvenating Body Wash – the grapefruit range is aimed at those with uneven or dull skintone. This pearlised white shower gel has a gentle zingy grapefruit scent to wake you up in the morning and exfoliating fruit acids help to remove dead skin cells leaving your skin glowing and smooth. The ingredients are 98% natural and the body wash gives a light foam in the shower. I really like it, grapefruit is one of my favourite fruity scents and the large 280ml tube will last me for ages. Yes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo & Pampering Conditioner – I always avoid sodium laureth sulphate (SLS) in my haircare products as I have a very sensitive scalp and SLS makes it really itchy and sore, so I was really pleased to read that this shampoo and conditioner are SLS free. Made from 97% and 95% natural ingredients respectively this shampoo and conditioner have been formulated for those with a dry scalp and contain carrot seed oil. Both products have a pleasant sweet scent although I wouldn’t say they smell of carrots!

Usage: Cut the metal bar into two equal sizes by wrapping it in a towel and gently tapping it with a hammer.

Question: Who probably examines his life after writing the text? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The author probably examines their life after writing the text. The reason behind this deduction is that the text encourages the reader to envision a better, evolved version of themselves, focusing on various aspects such as physical appearance, emotional wellbeing, mental health, and behavior. The author provides a comprehensive framework for readers to follow in their self-exploratory journey, which suggests that they might have gone through this process themselves. It is likely that the author wrote the text either as a reflection of their own experiences or as a guideline to help themselves and others in their personal development journey. By creating this detailed, vivid image of the ideal future self, the author provides a roadmap for readers to make better decisions in various aspects of their lives, such as relationships, work, self-care, and personal growth. By asking readers to study their behavior, thought patterns, and emotional responses, the author likely gained insights into their own life, as well. The act of writing this text might have been therapeutic, providing them with clarity and motivation to continue pursuing their personal growth journey. Additionally, sharing their experience would have served as a reminder to the author to stay on track and make conscious choices in line with their vision for their ideal future self. In conclusion, the author probably examines their life after writing the text, as it is evident that this framework is designed to invoke introspection and self-analysis. The process of authoring such a text likely involved a deep understanding of their own life, struggles, and vision for their future self.

The digital data on a CD begins at the center of the disc and proceeds toward the edge, which allows adaptation to the different size formats available. Standard CDs are available in two sizes.

This capacity was reportedly specified by Sony executive Norio Ohga in May 1980 so as to be able to contain the entirety of the London Philharmonic Orchestra's recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on one disc.

We show sadness and happiness through our expressions. But exactly how many emotions can our face make?Scientists used to believe we had six basic facial expressions that tell others how we feel: sad, happy, surprised, fearful, angry and disgusted . But a new study shows that our faces can do more than we think. Scientists from Ohio State University found out that humans can actually make 21 different facial expressions after studying how people move their facial muscles. The scientists took pictures of 230 volunteers making faces in response to different cues .These cues included phrases like \\"you just got some great unexpected news\\", which produced a \\"happily surprised\\" reaction from volunteers. Other cues included \\"you smell a bad odor \\", which caused \\"disgusted\\" faces. In total, around 5,000 pictures were taken of the volunteers. The scientists then studied similarities of these pictures using a computer expression database. _ helped them to define a facial expression. \\"That tells us that these 21 emotions are expressed in the same way by nearly everyone,\\" said DrAleix Martinez to The Daily Telegraph. For example, to express surprise, 92 percent of volunteers widened their eyes and opened their mouth. And 99 percent raised their cheeks and smiled to show being happy. We are not always aware of our facial expressions, which can hold clues to how we really feel. So these results may have a big impact on medical treatment. If doctors were able to recognize more complex emotions, it would help doctors treat patients suffering from certain diseases.

My thick black hair had been recently cut short into an untidy style. Her natural blonde hair flowed to her waist and looked great. I was 12 and one of the oldest in the class while she was 11 and the youngest. I was awkward and shy. She wasn't. I couldn't stand her, considering her my enemy. But she liked me and wanted to be friends. One day, she invited me over and I said yes--I was too shocked to answer any other way. My family had moved six times in six years, and I had never managed to develop any friendships. But this girl who wore the latest fashions wanted me to go home with her after school. She lived in a fun part of town that had two pizza places, an all-night bookstore, a movie theater and a park. As we walked from the school bus stop through her neighborhood, I tried to guess which house might be hers. Was it the white one with the perfect lawn or the three-story house with a front porch? I got very surprised when she led me into an old apartment building. She lived on the fourth floor in a two-room place with her mother,her stepfather, her two brothers and her sister. When we got into the room she shared with her sister, she took out a big case of Babies, which was my next surprise. I had never played with them.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Available options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no","completion":"The available options for the given multi-choice question are \\"yes,\\" \\"it is not possible to tell,\\" and \\"no.\\" To provide a detailed and long answer, let's first analyze the two sentences provided before determining which of the available options applies. Sentence 1: \\"1999: Turnout for Apocalypse Lighter Than Expected\\" suggests that the number of people who participated or were present during the so-called \\"Apocalypse\\" was lower than initially anticipated. This statement implies that there were expectations about the turnout for this event, and the actual number of people showing up did not meet those expectations, making the turnout \\"lighter\\" than anticipated. Sentence 2: \\"Many more people showed up for the Apocalypse than expected\\" indicates a situation where the turnout for the Apocalypse surpassed expectations. This statement is in direct contrast to Sentence 1, as it implies that the number of participants or attendees exceeded the predicted figures. Now that we've analyzed both sentences, let's examine the multi-choice question itself: \\"If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?\\" As mentioned earlier, Sentence 1 establishes that the turnout for the Apocalypse was lower than expected. Therefore, if Sentence 1 is true, it directly conflicts with Sentence 2, which claims the turnout was higher than anticipated. Considering this contradiction, the correct option for this multi-choice question is \\"no,\\" as Sentence 2 cannot be true if Sentence 1 is true. These two statements present opposite scenarios, so they cannot both be accurate at the same time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Go Tell the Spartans Movie plot: Major Asa Barker (Burt Lancaster) has been given this command: a poorly-manned outpost over seeing three villages named Boo Jum, Mung Tau &amp; Hat Song and he is ordered to re-occupy a nearby, deserted hamlet named Muc Wa in rural South Vietnam somewhere near the rural Da Nang to Phnom Penh (Cambodia) highway that a decade earlier had been the scene of a massacre of French soldiers during the First Indochina War. Barker is a weary infantry veteran in his third war (he served in the Pacific during World War II as well as in the Korean War), who provides veteran supervision to a cadre of advisors attached to a group of South Vietnamese who are ordered to garrison the deserted hamlet of Muc Wa.[2] Major Barker and his executive officer, the career orientated Captain Olivetti receive four replacements.

Article: A 15-year-old Saanich student who invented a flashlight powered by body heat is heading home today from California with a big prize--and an opportunity to expand on her work. St. Michaels University School student Ann Makosinski was the only Canadian among the four winners at Google's annual international science fair, beating out thousands of other young scientists from around the world. Winning the international contest was \\"a total shock\\", Ann said from San Francisco. \\"I definitely think it will have an influence on my future.\\" Ann thanked her family for encouraging her interest in science, telling the judges that her first toy was a box of transistors . Ann's prize includes a 25,000 scholarship and a \\"once-in-a-lifetime experience\\" from either the European Organization for Nuclear Research, Lego or Google for her Hollow Flashlight, which has no moving parts or batteries. Ann created the flashlight for a local science fair. The inspiration for the invention came from seeing unwanted batteries and after visits to the Philippines, where she saw the need for a battery-free flashlight. A friend at school there failed in her studies because of a lack of electricity and light to study when it became dark. In her project, Ann wrote that she \\"made two flashlights that do not use any batteries, harmful chemicals, or kinetic energy . They do not create any noise and will always work. The flashlight's only limitation is its need for at least a 5degC temperature difference to provide usable light.\\" A You Tube video of Ann explaining how she created the flashlight has been viewed more than 1.4 million times. Despite her success, the private school student is undecided about her career path. Ann hopes she can find a way to combine her love of film with science. The four winners were chosen from 15 finalists from eight countries. The contest attracted thousands of entries from students in 120 countries. Question: What do we know about Ann Makosinski?

En effet, soumettre la santé à cette logique entraînerait une participation basée uniquement sur le libre choix du service de santé ou du professionnel de soins, ce qui risque d'exacerber les inégalités et de menacer les systèmes de protections sociales. Les conséquences d'une telle situation sont multiples et peuvent générer une large gamme de problèmes pour les individus et la société en général. Tout d'abord, les services de santé fonctionnant selon les impératifs du marché pourraient être plus intéressés par les profits que par la prestation de soins de qualité. Cela peut se traduire par une diminution de la qualité des soins ou par une augmentation des coûts pour les patients, lesquels sont souvent confrontés à des choix difficiles pour accéder aux meilleurs traitements. De plus, lorsque la logique du marché prédomine dans le domaine des soins de santé, il est probable que les patients ayant les moyens financiers et les connaissances nécessaires pour choisir parmi les services de santé disponibles soient privilégiés. Cela marginalise ceux qui sont moins informés, moins aisés ou qui font face à des barrières culturelles pour accéder à des soins de qualité. Ce phénomène peut alors contribuer à creuser les inégalités en matière de santé et à fragiliser les systèmes de couverture maladie universelle. Afin de prévenir de telles conséquences, il est crucial d'adopter une approche plus holistique et équitable de la santé et de l'accès aux soins. Un système de santé performant doit garantir une qualité de soins élevée pour tous, indépendamment du statut économique ou social des patients. Des régulations et des politiques publiques doivent être mises en place pour garantir que tous les acteurs du secteur de la santé (hôpitaux, cliniques, médecins, etc.) se conforment aux normes éthiques et aux exigences en matière de qualité de l'ensemble de la population. En résumé, le fait de soumettre la santé à la logique du marché entraîne des risques pour la société et les individus, aggravant les inégalités et menaçant les systèmes de protection sociale.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed in a financial report filed with the government’s ethics watchdog Tuesday that he had reimbursed his personal lawyer more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses. In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties.

Notice any shortness of breath. Look for a higher frequency of respiratory diseases. Article:","completion":"Title: Recognizing the Signs of Teenage Smoking: A Guide for Parents Introduction As a parent, it's essential to be aware of the various signs and symptoms that might indicate your teenager has picked up the habit of smoking. Not only is smoking harmful to their health in the immediate sense, but it can also have long-lasting consequences that can follow them into adulthood. In this article, we will discuss the signs and symptoms to watch for, such as the infamous smoker's cough and yellowing teeth, and provide tips for addressing the issue if you suspect your child is smoking. 1. The Smoker's Cough One of the most noticeable and early signs of smoking is the persistent smoker's cough. This cough is characterized by a raspy, dry, and sometimes painful hacking that can become more severe in the mornings. If your teenager experiences frequent or prolonged bouts of coughing that seem out of the ordinary, it's worth considering the possibility that they may be smoking. 2. Yellowing Teeth Yellowing teeth are another sign of smoking, and it's essential to take notice if your child's teeth appear to be turning yellow or they complain of stained teeth. Smoking can cause severe damage to the teeth and gums over time and may lead to oral health issues that could become more serious if left untreated. 3. Stains on Fingers Notice any suspicious yellow stains on your teenager's fingers or hands? These stains could be a result of nicotine and tar buildup from frequent smoking. If you spot such discoloration, it's essential to talk openly and honestly with your child about the potential risks of their habit. 4. Wheezing and Shortness of Breath If your teenager is experiencing wheezing, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing during light activity, it could be a sign of smoking. The inhalation of cigarette smoke weakens lung function over time, making it more difficult for their lungs to provide adequate oxygen, leading to these symptoms. 5. Frequent Respiratory Diseases Smoking can also contribute to a higher frequency of respiratory diseases like bronchitis and pneumonia. Keeping track of your child's health history can help in identifying patterns that may be linked to their smoking habits. If you notice they have recurring respiratory infections, it's essential to talk with them about the dangers of smoking and the impact it can have on their overall health. Conclusion Recognizing the signs of teenage smoking is crucial in helping your child make healthy choices and potentially avoid a lifetime of nicotine addiction. If you suspect your teenager is smoking, it's essential to have an open, honest, and non-judgmental conversation with them about the risks involved. Encourage them to seek professional help if necessary, and remind them that it's never too late to quit and improve their health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.
