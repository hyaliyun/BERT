Let ( Omega ) be the circumcenter of this polygon. 5. **Analyzing the Polygon:** - The polygon must contain the center of ( Omega ), otherwise, the edge closest to the center would be strictly longer than any other distance between points, which contradicts the given condition. - Consider the shortest edge in ( X_1, ldots, X_n ), and assume it is ( X_1X_2 ). For any ( i neq j ), we have ( textrm{d}(X_i, X_j) geq min{textrm{d}(X_i, X_{i-1}), textrm{d}(X_i, X_{i+1})} ) since ( X_j ) does not lie on the arc ( X_{i-1}X_iX_{i+1} ). 6. **Forcing Alternating Side Lengths:** - For each ( i ), we must have ( X_1X_2 in {textrm{d}(X_i, X_{i-1}), textrm{d}(X_i, X_{i+1})} ). - If for some ( i ), ( textrm{d}(X_i, X_{i-1}) = textrm{d}(X_i, X_{i+1}) = X_1X_2 ), then by a similar argument, we force ( textrm{d}(X_j, X_{j-1}) = textrm{d}(X_j, X_{j+1}) = X_1X_2 ) for all ( j ). 7. **Conclusion for Odd and Even ( n ):** - For ( n ) odd, this forces all sides to be equal, making the polygon regular. - For ( n ) even, this is also forced unless we have ( X_1X_2 = X_3X_4 = cdots = X_{n-1}X_n ). In this case, the sides must alternate in length. Thus, the configurations are: - For ( n ) odd: The points form a regular ( n )-gon. - For ( n ) even: The points form a convex cyclic ( n )-gon with alternating side lengths.

By combining inequalities, we can find the range of m. Solution steps: 1. From the problem, we know that if Acap Bneq varnothing, then Aneq varnothing.

Consider the sequences ( (4, 2, 2) ) and ( (4, 4, 0) ). We have: [ (4, 2, 2) prec (4, 4, 0) ] By Muirhead's theorem, we obtain: [ a^4b^2c^2 + a^2b^4c^2 + a^2b^2c^4 leq a^4b^4 + b^4c^4 + c^4a^4 ] Dividing both sides by ( a^2b^2c^2 ), we get: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 leq frac{a^2b^2}{c^2} + frac{b^2c^2}{a^2} + frac{c^2a^2}{b^2} ] Taking the square root of both sides and dividing by 3, we obtain: [ sqrt{frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}} leq frac{frac{ab}{c} + frac{bc}{a} + frac{ca}{b}}{3} ] This completes the proof of the second inequality. 3. **Conditions for Equality:** - For the first inequality ( frac{a + b + c}{3} leq sqrt{frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}} ), equality holds if and only if ( a = b = c ).

Similarly, since B boys are equal to W women (and therefore also equal to 9 men), we can replace BB with 9M: 9M + 9M + 9M = Rs. 216 This simplifies to: 27M = Rs. 216 Now, we can solve for the earnings of one man (M): M = Rs. 216 / 27 M = Rs. 8 Therefore, the wages of one man are Rs. 8. Since there are 9 men, the total wages for the men would be: 9 men * Rs. 8/man = Rs. 72 So, the men's wages are Rs. boxed{72} ."},{"prompt":"There is an interesting phenomenon in even number sequences: (1)2+4=6; (2)8+10+12=14+16; (3)18+20+22+24=26+28+30.

Since the pattern of interest rates is increasing, we have R1 < R2 < R3 < R4. The total interest (I) after 4 years is given as Rs. 192, and the principal amount (P) is Rs. 800. The formula for simple interest is: I = P * R * T / 100 Where: I = Interest P = Principal R = Rate of interest per year T = Time in years For each year, the interest earned would be: Interest for 1st year = P * R1 / 100 Interest for 2nd year = P * R2 / 100 Interest for 3rd year = P * R3 / 100 Interest for 4th year = P * R4 / 100 The total interest over 4 years is the sum of the interests of each year: Total Interest = (P * R1 / 100) + (P * R2 / 100) + (P * R3 / 100) + (P * R4 / 100) We know the total interest is Rs. 192, so we can write: 192 = (800 * R1 / 100) + (800 * R2 / 100) + (800 * R3 / 100) + (800 * R4 / 100) Simplifying, we get: 192 = 8 * (R1 + R2 + R3 + R4) Dividing both sides by 8, we get: 24 = R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 Now, we have one equation with four unknowns, which means there are infinite solutions to this problem. Without additional information about the relationship between the rates or additional constraints, we cannot determine the unique values of R1, R2, R3, and R4. However, if we assume that the rates increase by an equal amount each year, we could denote the increase as 'd'. Then we would have: R2 = R1 + d R3 = R1 + 2d R4 = R1 + 3d Substituting these back into the equation, we get: 24 = R1 + (R1 + d) + (R1 + 2d) + (R1 + 3d) Combining like terms, we get: 24 = 4R1 + 6d This still gives us two unknowns, so we would need additional information to solve for boxed{R1} and d.

Removing the first or last term is not possible because the remaining three terms would form a geometric sequence, leading to the conclusion that d = 0, which is a contradiction. - If the second term (a_2) is removed, then we have a_3^2 = a_1 cdot a_4, which simplifies to (a_1 + 2d)^2 = a_1 cdot (a_1 + 3d). Simplifying further, we obtain a_1 + 4d = 0 and thus, boxed{frac{a_1}{d} = -4}. - If the third term (a_3) is removed, then a_2^2 = a_1 cdot a_4, leading to (a_1 + d)^2 = a_1 cdot (a_1 + 3d). After simplification, we get a_1 - d = 0 and consequently, boxed{frac{a_1}{d} = 1}. (ii) For n = 5, by similar reasoning as in the case of n = 4, we cannot remove a_1, a_2, a_4, a_5 without producing three consecutive terms that would form a geometric sequence. If the third term, a_3, is removed, the equality a_1 cdot a_5 = a_2 cdot a_4 should hold, which simplifies to a_1(a_1 + 4d) = (a_1 + d)(a_1 + 3d). We then obtain 3d^2 = 0, which contradicts the initial condition that d neq 0. Therefore, a_3 cannot be removed. When n geq 6, such an arithmetic sequence does not exist. Removing any of the interior terms would lead to the relationship a_1 cdot a_n = a_{k-1} cdot a_{k+1} for some term k, which again contradicts the condition d neq 0 and implies continuous three remaining terms would form a geometric sequence. Thus, the only possible value of n is boxed{n = 4}. For part (2): Assume that there is an arithmetic sequence of positive integers n with a common difference d for some positive integer n (with n geq 4), such that the three terms b_{x+1}, b_{y+1}, b_{z+1} (0 leq x < y < z leq n - 1) form a geometric sequence. Then, b_{y+1}^2 = b_{x+1} cdot b_{z+1}, which simplifies to (b_1 + yd)^2 = (b_1 + xd)(b_1 + zd). Further simplification yields (y^2 - xz)d^2 = (x + z - 2y)b_1d (*). Since b_1d neq 0, it follows that either both y^2 - xz and x + z - 2y are zero, or both are non-zero. The former cannot be true since it would imply x = y = z, which contradicts the assumption of distinct terms. Therefore, both are non-zero, and from equation (*), we have frac{b_1}{d} = frac{y^2 - xz}{x + z - 2y}. Given that 0 leq x < y < z leq n - 1 and x, y, z are integers, the right side of the equation represents a rational number. Thus frac{b_1}{d} is a rational number. For any positive integer n (with n geq 4), as long as frac{b_1}{d} is an irrational number, the sequence will satisfy the condition of the problem. An example sequence for n terms would be 1, 1 + sqrt{2}, 1 + 2sqrt{2}, ldots, 1 + (n - 1)sqrt{2}, which meets the requirements."},{"prompt":"Let p and q be the solutions of the equation 3x^2 + 9x 21 = 0.

Combining equations, we derive: [ frac{DG}{GF} cdot frac{BF}{CB} cdot frac{LC}{CD} cdot frac{KC}{KL} = 1. ] 10.

For (P(x) = (x^2 - a)(x^2 - b)(x^2 - c)), this means that for every prime (p), there must be some integer (n) such that (p) divides ((n^2 - a)(n^2 - b)(n^2 - c)). 2. **Condition for Prime-Covering:** The polynomial (P(x) = (x^2 - a)(x^2 - b)(x^2 - c)) is prime-covering if and only if there exists an odd number of (a, b, c) such that their product is a perfect square. This is because for any prime (p), we need (n^2 equiv a pmod{p}), (n^2 equiv b pmod{p}), or (n^2 equiv c pmod{p}) to hold for some (n). 3. **Counting Valid Triples:** We need to count the number of ordered triples ((a, b, c)) such that (1 leq a < b < c leq 25) and the product (abc) is a perfect square. 4. **Perfect Square Condition:** For (abc) to be a perfect square, each prime factor in the prime factorizations of (a, b,) and (c) must appear an even number of times in the product (abc). This implies that the exponents of the prime factors in the product (abc) must all be even. 5. **Generating Triples:** We need to generate all possible triples ((a, b, c)) and check if the product (abc) is a perfect square. This can be done by iterating over all possible values of (a, b,) and (c) within the given range and checking the condition. 6. **Iterating Over Values:** We iterate over all possible values of (a, b,) and (c) such that (1 leq a < b < c leq 25) and count the number of triples that satisfy the condition.

Therefore, by using the task II.13.62(b), we have: [ mathrm{E}[I(xi > a) mid eta] = sum_n frac{Psi^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (-1)^n rho^n H_n(eta). ] 6. Consequently, [ begin{aligned} mathrm{P}(xi > a, eta > b) &= mathrm{E}[I(xi > a) I(eta > b)] &= mathrm{E} left[ sum_n frac{Psi^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (-1)^n rho^n H_n(eta) sum_k frac{Psi^{(k)}(b)}{k!} (-1)^k H_k(eta) right] &= sum_n frac{Psi^{(n)}(a) Psi^{(n)}(b)}{n!} rho^n. end{aligned} ] 7. Thus, the density function (xi, eta) is: [ phi(a, b, rho) = sum_n frac{Psi^{(n+1)}(a) Psi^{(n+1)}(b)}{n!} rho^n. ] 8. Therefore, [ mathrm{P}(xi > a, eta > b) = Psi(a) Psi(b) + int_{0}^{rho} phi(a, b, r) , dr, ] which is the desired equality. 9. For proving the given inequality, we use Hoeffding's formula: [ begin{aligned} operatorname{cov}(f(xi), g(eta)) &= int_{mathbb{R}^2} [mathrm{P}(xi > a, eta > b) - mathrm{P}(xi > a) mathrm{P}(eta > b)] f'(a) g'(b) , da , db &= int_{mathbb{R}^2} left( int_{0}^{rho} f'(a) g'(b) phi(a, b, r) , dr right) , da , db &= int_{0}^{rho} mathrm{E}[ f'(xi_r) g'(eta_r) ] , dr. quad blacksquare end{aligned} ] Conclusively, we have shown both the desired equality and the covariance expression using Hoeffding's formula.

Show that if the set of all positive integers is partitioned into four sets A_1, A_2, A_3, and A_4, then for any integer n geq 15, at least one of the partitions A_i contains no two distinct integers whose sum is n. Part 1 1. Let's partition the set of all positive integers as follows: - A_1 = {3k, 3k+3 mid k geq 3}, - A_2 = {3k+1, 3k+4 mid k geq 3}, - A_3 = {3k+2, 3k+5 mid k geq 3}. 2.

Since A can complete the work in 20 days, A's one day work is 1/20 of the total work. Similarly, B can complete the work in 30 days, so B's one day work is 1/30 of the total work. When A and B work together, their one day work is the sum of their individual one day works: A's one day work + B's one day work = 1/20 + 1/30 To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 60 in this case: (3/60) + (2/60) = 5/60 So, together, A and B can complete 5/60 (or 1/12) of the work in one day.

This means that for all ( m in mathbb{N}^* ), ( a_{i+mT} = a_i ). 4. **Substituting in the Periodicity Condition**: We know from the periodic property that if ( n geq N_0 ) for some sufficiently large ( N_0 ), we have ( a_{n+T} = a_n ). Now let’s choose ( k = mT ), where ( m ) is an integer such that ( k geq N_0 ). 5. **Verification**: Then ( a_{2k} = a_{k+T} ). By the periodicity property ( a_{k+T} = a_k ), we have: [ a_{2k} = a_k. ] 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, there exists a ( k ) such that ( a_{2k} = a_k ).

Let the symmetric point of the right focus F with respect to l_1 be M. If the coordinates of the right focus F are (c, 0), then point M has coordinates (m, -frac{bm}{a}) due to its symmetric property.

Next, we use this result to calculate the entire expression: [ left(-15right)*left[left(+3right)*0right] = left(-15right)*3 ] Since -15 and 3 have different signs, the result takes the negative sign, and the value is the sum of their absolute values, which gives us: [ left(-15right)*3 = -18 ] Therefore, the answer to part (1) is boxed{-18}.

Together, their combined work rate per day is: ( frac{1}{45} + frac{1}{40} ) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 45 and 40 is 360.

Prove that there exists a polynomial ( S(x) ) such that ( P(x) = S(Q(x)) ). 1. Assume the contrary: consider polynomials ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) ) for which the statement is false and let the degree of ( P(x) ) be the smallest possible. Denote the degrees of ( P ) and ( Q ) by ( n ) and ( k ) respectively. 2.

Clearly, ( n > 0 ) since if ( n = 0 ), we can set ( S(x) = P(x) ). 4. **Lemma:** ( n ) is divisible by ( k ). 5. **Proof of Lemma:** - Consider the leading component ( T_C(x, y) ) of a bivariate polynomial ( T(x, y) ) as the sum of all its monomials with the highest total degree. For example, the leading component of ( x^3 + 3xy^2 + x - 2y^2 ) is ( x^3 + 3xy^2 ). - The leading component of a product is the product of the leading components.

Therefore, [ y^{mk} (x^r - y^r) ] must also be divisible by ( x^k - y^k ). However, since the degree in ( x ) is less than ( k ), it implies ( r = 0 ), so ( n = mk ). 6. Let ( n = mk ). Consider the polynomial ( P_1(x) = P(x) - Q^m(x) ) and ( Q(x) ). 7.

By simplifying the equation, we get: [ k(k+1) = (n-k)(n+k+1). ] 3. Rearranging terms, this can be rewritten as: [ k(k+1) = n(n+1) - k(k+1). ] 4. Adding (k(k+1)) to both sides, we have: [ 2k(k+1) = n(n+1). ] 5. We can further manipulate this relationship by setting (x = 2n+1) and (y = 2k+1).

Now, multiplying both sides by sin A sin B cos A and using the fact that sin C = sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B, we have: sin A sin B cos A + sin^2 A cos B = 2a sin(A + B) cos A Dividing both sides by sin B cos A, we obtain: sin A + sin A cot B = 2a frac{sin(A + B) cos A}{sin B cos A} Using the identity cot B = frac{cos B}{sin B} and simplifying, we get: sin A + sin A frac{cos B}{sin B} = 2a frac{sin(A + B)}{sin B} Now, let's focus on the right-hand side of the equation: 2a frac{sin(A + B)}{sin B} = 2a frac{sin A cos B + cos A sin B}{sin B} Dividing both the numerator and denominator by sin B, we have: 2a frac{sin A cos B + cos A sin B}{sin B} = 2a left( frac{sin A cos B}{sin B} + cos A right) Now, equating the left and right sides of the equation, we get: sin A + sin A frac{cos B}{sin B} = 2a left( frac{sin A cos B}{sin B} + cos A right) Since frac{cos B}{sin B} = cot B, we have: sin A + sin A cot B = 2a (cot B + cos A) Now, let's isolate cos A on one side of the equation: cos A = frac{sin A + sin A cot B}{2a} - cot B Using the identity cot B = frac{cos B}{sin B} and simplifying, we obtain: cos A = frac{sin A}{2a} + frac{sin A cos B}{2a sin B} - frac{cos B}{sin B} Now, let's recall that sin C = sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. We can rearrange this equation to express cos A in terms of sin A, sin B, and sin C: cos A = frac{sin C - sin A cos B}{sin B} Comparing this expression with the previous one, we have: frac{sin C - sin A cos B}{sin B} = frac{sin A}{2a} + frac{sin A cos B}{2a sin B} - frac{cos B}{sin B} To simplify this equation, we can multiply both sides by 2a sin B: 2a (sin C - sin A cos B) = sin A sin B + sin A cos B - 2a cos B Now, let's isolate sin A on one side of the equation: sin A (sin B + cos B) = 2a sin C - 2a cos B Dividing both sides by sin B + cos B, we obtain: sin A = frac{2a (sin C - cos B)}{sin B + cos B} Now, recalling that c = frac{a sin C}{sin A}, we can substitute this expression for c into the original equation: 1 + frac{tan A}{tan B} = frac{2a sin C}{b sin A} Multiplying both sides by sin A tan B, we have: sin A + sin A tan B = 2a sin C frac{tan B}{sin B} Now, using the identity tan B = frac{sin B}{cos B} and simplifying, we get: sin A + sin A frac{sin B}{cos B} = 2a sin C frac{1}{cos B} Now, let's isolate sin A on one side of the equation: sin A = frac{2a sin C}{cos B + sin B} Comparing this expression with the previous one, we have: frac{2a (sin C - cos B)}{sin B + cos B} = frac{2a sin C}{cos B + sin B} Simplifying, we obtain: sin C - cos B = sin C This equation implies that cos B = 0, which is impossible since B is an angle of a triangle. Therefore, we must have made an error in our calculations. Let's go back to the equation 1 + frac{sin A cos B}{cos A sin B} = frac{2a sin C}{b sin A} and try to solve it again. This time, let's express sin C in terms of sin A and sin B using the Law of Sines: sin C = frac{c sin A}{a} = frac{b sin A}{2 sin B} Substituting this expression into the equation, we have: 1 + frac{sin A cos B}{cos A sin B} = frac{2b sin A}{2 sin B sin A} Simplifying, we obtain: 1 + cot A cot B = 1 This equation implies that cot A cot B = 0. Since cot A and cot B cannot both be zero (because A and B are angles of a triangle), we must have either cot A = 0 or cot B = 0. If cot A = 0, then cos A = 0 and sin A = pm 1. Since A is an angle of a triangle, we must have 0 < A < pi and hence sin A = 1. Therefore, cos A = 0 implies that A = frac{pi}{2}. If cot B = 0, then cos B = 0 and sin B = pm 1. Since B is an angle of a triangle, we must have 0 < B < pi and hence sin B = 1. Therefore, cos B = 0 implies that B = frac{pi}{2}. However, since A and B are angles of the same triangle, they cannot both be equal to frac{pi}{2}. Therefore, we must have cot A = 0 and cot B neq 0. This implies that A = frac{pi}{2} and B neq frac{pi}{2}. Hence, the measure of angle A is boxed{frac{pi}{2}}."},{"prompt":"Consider a circular park consisting of an outerring path for walkers (white), a ringshaped flower garden (gray) surrounding a central circular fountain (black).

So, we have: Remaining distance in 1/5 mile increments = (8 - 0.2) / 0.2 Remaining distance in 1/5 mile increments = 7.8 / 0.2 Remaining distance in 1/5 mile increments = 39 So, there are 39 increments of 1/5 mile in the remaining distance. The total charge for the 8-mile ride is 19.1, which includes the initial charge of 3.50 for the first 1/5 mile.

The radius of the larger circle is given as 6. By drawing the radius from the center of the larger circle, O, to the point of contact, A, with one of the smaller circles, we establish that the line OA is a radius of the larger circle and also acts as a diameter for the smaller circle touching at A. 2. **Determine the Radius of the Smaller Circles**: Since the radius of the larger circle is 6, the diameter of the smaller circle, which is the same as the radius OA of the larger circle, is also 6. Therefore, the radius of each smaller circle is half of this, which is 3. 3. **Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region**: The area of the shaded region can be found by subtracting the combined areas of the two smaller circles from the area of the larger circle. The area of a circle is given by pi r^2, where r is the radius of the circle. - The area of the larger circle is pi times 6^2 = 36pi. - The area of one smaller circle is pi times 3^2 = 9pi. - Since there are two smaller circles, their combined area is 2 times 9pi = 18pi.

According to the information given, Ashok's capital is 1/9 of Pyarelal's capital. So we can write: A = (1/9) * P Now, since they share the loss in the business in proportion to their investments, we can say that the ratio of their losses will be the same as the ratio of their capitals. Therefore, the loss Ashok incurred (L_A) to the loss Pyarelal incurred (L_P) will be: L_A / L_P = A / P We know that Pyarelal's loss (L_P) is Rs 900. So we can write: L_A / 900 = (1/9) * P / P Since P is not zero, we can cancel P from both sides: L_A / 900 = 1/9 Now, we can solve for L_A (Ashok's loss): L_A = 900 * (1/9) L_A = 100 So, Ashok's loss is Rs 100.

Therefore, if the vertex angle is 100^{circ}, we can calculate the base angles as follows: [ text{Sum of base angles} = 180^{circ} - 100^{circ} = 80^{circ} ] Since the base angles are equal, each base angle is: [ text{Base angle} = frac{80^{circ}}{2} = 40^{circ} ] **Case 2:** The 100^{circ} angle is one of the base angles. In this scenario, if one of the base angles is 100^{circ}, and since it's an isosceles triangle (where the base angles are supposed to be equal), the other base angle would also be 100^{circ}.

This choice is crucial as it imposes constraints on the second player’s moves. 2. **Second player’s forced moves:** - Given that the ((0,0)) domino is already placed, the second player must select a domino of the form ((0, a)) or ((a, 0)) with (a neq 0). - By the rules of the game, the second player can place this domino such that it either connects (0) on the left or right side of the existing chain, i.e., at the former existing extremity. 3. **First player’s strategic response:** - The first player then picks the domino ((a, a)). - When the player places the domino ((a, a)), it ensures that the property: [ text{for all integers } k, text{ the domino } (0, k) text{ is available if and only if the domino } (a, k) text{ is available} ] holds. Here, (a neq 0). 4. **Maintaining the game’s constraint:** - With the above move, the first player has also created a condition where the second player: - Cannot choose a double domino (of the form ((b, b)) for any (b)) directly, as they must make one of the ends fit the existing sequence transformation created by ((a,a)). - Is thus restricted to playable dominoes of the form ((0, k)) or ((a, k)). 5. **Ongoing game play:** - From this point forward, the intermixed dominoes must follow the rule set, which ensures that the first player can always select an acceptable ((0, k)) or ((a, k)) in response to the second player’s move. - By placing the corresponding domino when possible, the first player perpetuates the applicable constraint guiding subsequent choices. 6. **Game conclusion:** - Essentially, each time the second player plays a domino of the form ((0, k)) or ((a, k)), the first player responds by the placement of the corresponding form that fits, until the second player runs out of moves. Given this winning strategy, it is assured that the first player is never blocked from making a move until the second player is inevitably forced into a position where they can no longer play. # Conclusion: The first player has a winning strategy, guaranteeing they will not be the first to run out of moves according to the stated rule's dynamics.

For tangency, the functions must satisfy: [ h(t) = ln t - 3t^2 + 2a ] must have exactly one root where the derivative ( h'(t) ) is also zero at the intersection point.

Therefore, each column will have at most three elements in ( T ). We can choose three elements in every column to be in ( T ), making: [ |T| = frac{3}{4} |S| = 5979 ] However, we need to ensure no squares are formed. 5. **Pattern Construction:** Consider a pattern where four columns of three elements each are adjacent, ensuring no two columns are the same permutation of red and blue dots (to avoid forming a square).

Then Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions assures the existence of infinitely many primes ( p equiv a pmod{s} ).

Summing these inequalities, we get: [ sum_{i=1}^4 S_i = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4 leq 4S ] 4. Therefore, [ lambda = frac{sum_{i=1}^{4} S_{i}}{S} leq 4 ] This shows that (lambda leq 4). 5. Now, we need to find the lower bound of (lambda). Consider a regular tetrahedron where all four faces are congruent equilateral triangles. Each face has an area (S) and hence (S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = S_4 = S). 6. In this case, [ sum_{i=1}^4 S_i = 4S quad text{and} quad lambda = frac{sum_{i=1}^{4} S_{i}}{S} = frac{4S}{S} = 4 ] 7. Next, let's explore a different configuration where: - Three faces ((S_1, S_2, S_3)) are equal, and a fourth face ((S_4)) has a distinct value to check that (lambda) can be different from 4 but still stay in the required range. 8. Consider a case where: [ S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = S quad text{and} quad S_4 = kS quad text{with} quad 0 < k < 1 ] Here, [ sum_{i=1}^4 S_i = S + S + S + kS = (3 + k) S ] Thus, [ lambda = frac{(3 + k) S}{S} = 3 + k quad text{where} quad 3 < lambda leq 4 quad text{since} quad k < 1 ] 9. This shows that (lambda) can get values strictly greater than 2 (because (0 < k < 1)). 10. Therefore, considering all scenarios, (lambda) satisfies: [ 2 < lambda leq 4 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{A. } 2 < lambda leq 4} ]"},{"prompt":"w many whole numbers from 1 through 60 are divisible by either 4 or 6 or both?

To find out how many trips are needed to carry all 12 crates, we divide the total minimum weight by the maximum weight per trip: 1440 kg / 600 kg/trip = 2.4 trips Since we can't have a fraction of a trip, we'll need to round up to the nearest whole number, which means the trailer will make 3 trips to carry all 12 crates.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: Total volume of bricks = Volume of one brick (without height) x height of brick x number of bricks Let's denote the height of the brick as h cm. Then the equation becomes: 1,960,000,000 cm³ = 200 cm² x h cm x 12,250 Now we can solve for h: h = 1,960,000,000 cm³ / (200 cm² x 12,250) h = 1,960,000,000 cm³ / 2,450,000 cm² h = 800 cm So the height of each brick is boxed{800} cm.

Since Oleg wants to buy an odd number of tulips and no color should be repeated, we need to consider the combinations of 1, 3, 5, ..., 19 tulips out of 20 available different colors. 3. Using the property of binomial coefficients: [ sum_{k=0}^{9} binom{20}{2k+1} = 2^{19} ] This sum represents all possible ways of choosing an odd number of items from 20 items. 4. The combination of selecting an odd number of tulips from 20 different colors can be viewed as a combinatorial problem where we use the property derived from the binomial theorem: [ sum_{k=0}^{n-1} binom{n}{2k+1} = 2^{n-1} ] By setting (n = 20), we obtain: [ sum_{k=0}^{9} binom{20}{2k+1} = 2^{19} ] 5.

The final weight ( w_{n+1} ) should ideally divide equally between ( L ) and ( H ), given that the sum of all weights ( w_1, w_2, ldots, w_{n+1} = 2n ) (an even number). - Mathematically, if ( L = H ), then placing ( w_{n+1} ) on either side keeps them balanced: [ L + w_{n+1}/2 = H + w_{n+1}/2 ] Thus, upon placing the final weight, balance is achieved.

Therefore, the sequence alternates between increasing and decreasing by odd numbers. 2. **Parity Consideration**: This assumption implies that the arrangement of numbers around the circle will cause even and odd numbers to alternate. Let's analyze the implications of this alternation. 3. **Sequence Properties**: Let's denote the numbers placed in the circle as ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2010} ) and ( a_{2010} equiv a_0 mod{2010} ). When moving from any even number to the next number: - Suppose ( a_i ) is even. According to our setup (alternating and difference being odd): - ( a_{i+1} ) must be odd, and the difference ( a_{i+1} - a_i ) must be an odd number. - Similarly, if ( a_i ) is odd, ( a_{i+1} ) must be even, and the difference ( a_{i+1} - a_i ) must be an odd number. Therefore, the sequence alternates between even and odd numbers, with each difference being an odd number. 4. **Positions of Extremes**: Consider the smallest and the largest even numbers in this sequence: - The smallest even number is 2. - The largest even number in our sequence is 2010. According to our assumption of alternating odd differences: - If an even number ( a_i = 2 ) is surrounded by two odd numbers ( a_{i-1}, a_{i+1} ): - If ( a_{i-1} = 1 ) and ( a_{i+1} = 3 ), we see: - ( 2 - 1 = 1 ) (odd) - ( 3 - 2 = 1 ) (odd) However, for the largest even number: - Consider the even number ( a_i = 2010 ), which must also be surrounded by odd numbers ( a_{i-1}, a_{i+1} ): - Let's say ( a_{i-1} = 2009 ) and ( a_{i+1} = 1 ) to wrap around: - ( 2010 - 2009 = 1 ) (odd) - ( 1 - 2010 = -2009 ) 5. **Contradiction**: However, the contradiction becomes very apparent: - The number ( 2 ) must be placed between two numbers that are both odd and less than it (which is not possible). - Similarly, the number ( 2010 ) must be placed and still maintain the sequence with odd differences (which logically requires placements outside the 1 to 2010 range at some points, contradicting the circular setup).

To find sin theta, we use the identity sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1: sin theta = sqrt{1 - cos^2 theta} = sqrt{1 - left(-frac{sqrt{5}}{5}right)^2} = sqrt{1 - frac{5}{25}} = sqrt{frac{20}{25}} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}.

Substituting the given values: begin{align*} overrightarrow{a}^2 &= 3^2 + (-4)^2 = 25, overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} &= 3 cdot 1 + (-4) cdot 2 = -5, overrightarrow{b}^2 &= 1^2 + 2^2 = 5. end{align*} Therefore, substituting these into our equation: 25m - 5(m-1) - 5 = 0.

When P and Q work together for 3 hours, they can complete a combined portion of the job. In one hour, together they can do 1/4 + 1/15 of the job.

Now, reduce modulo 51: [ k^3 - 51^2 k equiv m^3 - 51^2 m pmod{51} ] This simplifies to: [ k^3 equiv m^3 pmod{51} ] Given that 51 factors as (51 = 3 cdot 17), we need: begin{align*} k^3 equiv m^3 pmod{3} k^3 equiv m^3 pmod{17} end{align*} Since both 3 and 17 are primes, (k equiv m pmod{3}) and (k equiv m pmod{17}) must hold. Therefore: [ k equiv m pmod{51} ] Thus, (51 mid (k - m)), and ((1, -51^2)) is 51-good. Now, to show ((1, -51^2)) is not very good: Suppose (n) is such that ((1, -51^2)) is (n)-good. For (n=51), consider (k=51) and (m=0): [ f(51) - f(0) = 51^3 - 51^3 cdot 1 = 0 ] Therefore: [ n mid f(51) - f(0) = 0 ] Hence, (n) divides 51, which limits (n) to finite values among factors of 51. Hence, ((1, -51^2)) is not very good. Thus, we conclude that: [ boxed{left(1, -51^2right)} ] 2. **Proving that 2013-good implies very good:** First, recall that: [ 2013 = 3 times 11 times 61 ] We'll need several intermediate steps: 1. **Step 1:** If a couple is (pq)-good for coprime (p) and (q), then it is both (p)-good and (q)-good. 2. **Step 2:** If a couple is 61-good, then (a) is divisible by 61, and (b) is not. 3. **Step 3:** If (a) is divisible by 61 and (b) is not, then the couple is (61^i)-good for all (i in mathbb{N}). **Detailed proof:** 1. **Step 1 Technical Argument:** Given (pq mid (f(k) - f(m))), where (p) and (q) are coprime, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), there exist (K) and (M) such that (K equiv k pmod{p}) and (K equiv M equiv 0 pmod{q}). Consequently: [ pq mid (K - M) ] This implies: [ p mid (K - M) implies p mid (k - m) ] Therefore, the couple is (p)-good. 2. **Step 2 Technical Argument:** Assume the couple is 61-good. Suppose (a notequiv 0 pmod{61}): (61-1 = 60 = 2^2 cdot 3 cdot 5): [ w^3 equiv 1 pmod{61} ] Two cases arise, both leading to contradictions, proving (a) must be divisible by 61. 3. **Step 3 Argument:** Let (i geq 1), (a equiv 0 pmod{61}) and (b not equiv 0 pmod{61}). For (61^i mid f(k) - f(m)): [ 61^i mid (k - m)(a (k^2 + km + m^2) - b) ] Since (a) divisible by 61 and (b) is not, the second term, (a (k^2 + km + m^2 - b)), is coprime to 61.

To convert kmph to m/s, we multiply by (1000 m / 1 km) and divide by (3600 s / 1 hour): Relative speed in m/s = 119.99 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hour) Relative speed in m/s = 119.99 * 1000 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 119990 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 33.33 m/s (approximately) Now that we have the relative speed in m/s, we can use the time it takes for the train to cross the man to find the length of the train. Time = 9 seconds Length of train = Relative speed * Time Length of train = 33.33 m/s * 9 s Length of train = 299.97 m Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{299.97} meters."},{"prompt":"Find the point ( M' ) that is symmetric to the point ( M ) with respect to the plane.

This is because any point on the curve f(x) can be represented as (x, 2x^3 - 3x), and we're using x_0 to denote a specific x value at the point of tangency. 2. **Find the Derivative of f(x)**: To find the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve, we differentiate f(x) with respect to x. This gives us f'(x) = 6x^2 - 3. Evaluating this derivative at x = x_0 gives the slope of the tangent line at the point of tangency: f'(x_0) = 6x_0^2 - 3. 3. **Equation of the Tangent Line**: The general formula for the equation of a line is y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where (x_1, y_1) is a point on the line and m is the slope. Substituting m = 6x_0^2 - 3 and (x_1, y_1) = (x_0, 2x_0^3 - 3x_0), we get the equation of the tangent line as y - (2x_0^3 - 3x_0) = (6x_0^2 - 3)(x - x_0). 4. **Incorporate the Given Point (0,0)**: Since the tangent line passes through (0,0), we substitute x = 0 and y = 0 into the equation of the tangent line and solve for x_0.

The probability that explorer ( j ) does not receive any advice from these ( j-1 ) older explorers is given by the probability that there are no friendships with them.

The standard form of an ellipse's equation is frac{x^2}{a^2}+frac{y^2}{b^2}=1, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively, and a > b > 0. The eccentricity e of an ellipse is defined as e = sqrt{1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}}. Given that e = frac{1}{3}, we can express a and b in terms of a single variable m to simplify the calculations, assuming the relationship between a and b based on the eccentricity. Given that frac{1}{3} = sqrt{1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}}, we can rearrange this to find a relationship between a and b. However, to align closely with the solution provided, we assume the equation of the ellipse as frac{x^2}{9m^2}+frac{y^2}{8m^2}=1left(m > 0right), which is a specific form that simplifies to the given eccentricity condition. Next, we identify the vertices A_{1}, A_{2}, and B. For an ellipse frac{x^2}{a^2}+frac{y^2}{b^2}=1, the vertices along the major axis are at (pm a, 0), and the top vertex along the minor axis is at (0, b). Thus, for our assumed ellipse, A_{1}(-3m,0), A_{2}(3m,0), and B(0,2sqrt{2}m). We are given that overrightarrow{BA_{1}}cdot overrightarrow{BA_{2}}=-1. The dot product of two vectors overrightarrow{u} = (u_1, u_2) and overrightarrow{v} = (v_1, v_2) is given by overrightarrow{u} cdot overrightarrow{v} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2.

Given that the (20 - n)th decimal is 9, we need to find the value of n such that the nth decimal is also 9. Since the sequence \\"09\\" repeats every 2 digits, we can determine the position of the 9s in the sequence. They occur at every even position: 2nd, 4th, 6th, and so on. Let's denote the (20 - n)th position as P. We know that P is a position where the decimal is 9, so P must be even. Therefore, 20 - n is an even number. To find the nth position, we can set up the equation: 20 - n = 2k, where k is a positive integer representing the number of times the sequence \\"09\\" has repeated. Solving for n, we get: n = 20 - 2k Since we are looking for the nth decimal to also be 9, n must also be an even number (because 9s are at even positions). Therefore, k must be an integer such that 20 - 2k is even.

The tightened rope will enclose a certain polygon. Prove that this polygon has more than 56 vertices.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We have 57 regular 57-gons attached to the floor, forming a system that is enveloped by a taut rope. We need to prove that the polygon formed by this rope has no more than 56 vertices. 2. **Analyzing the Enclosed Polygon:** Each regular 57-gon has 57 vertices. Initially, considering all these regular 57-gons together, we might think of a system involving (57 times 57 = 3249) vertices. However, not all of these vertices will contribute to the outer polygon formed by the rope. 3. **Identifying the Relevant Vertices:** For the rope to create the boundary of the polygon, it will only touch the outermost vertices of our arrangement. To understand this, it's crucial to note that: - When multiple polygons are nailed together, some of their vertices do not form external points; they lie inside the arrangement or coincide with vertices of other polygons. - The vertices on the convex hull of the arrangement are the ones that define the boundary when tied by the rope. 4. **Convex Combination and Hull Formation:** If we analyze how convex hulls work, for a large arrangement or merging of 57 regular 57-gons, many vertices will fall inside the convex hull formed by their outer vertices. 5. **Calculating the Maximum Number of External Vertices:** For simplicity, begin by assuming that the first 57-gon completely encloses the remaining polygons: - This would mean the initial boundary vertices are (57). - Adding more polygons internally or at the vertices slightly modifies the convex hull, but cannot introduce all (57) additional vertices every time a new polygon is added due to internal overlaps and connections. 6. **Reduction in Vertex Count:** The number of additional outer vertices decreases progressively as more 57-gons are nailed: - As each additional 57-gon is connected, particularly when attached/shared at some vertices, they do not contribute all of their vertices to the outer boundary configuration. - Mathematically, the number of external vertices in similar configuration reduces due to overlaps (N_{new} = N_{previous} -1). 7. **Final Argument and Conclusion:** To form a polygon with the rope, combining multiple regular 57-gons that merge at their shared vertices or edges, leads to a polygon where the maximum external vertices — affected by shared edges and vertices across nailed 57-gons — logs a reduction iteratively. Thus, if placing these 57 gons starting initially with (57) vertices, and decrementally lesser when vertices combine, the external vertices fall below 57, leading to the count lower subsequently. Hence, after consideration of external bounding vertices and shared vertices interactions, we conclude that the final convex hull polygon represented by the tight rope constraint has: [ boxed{ leq 56 } ] We thereby prove the result because a polygon formed by the rope can have at most 56 vertices with combinatory effects from the shared vertices of the nailed regular 57-gons."},{"prompt":"f in space there are three lines a, b, and c that satisfy a perp b and b parallel c, then line a and line c are ( ) A: Definitely parallel B: Definitely intersecting C: Definitely skew lines D: Definitely perpendicular","completion":"Since line a is perpendicular to line b (a perp b), and line b is parallel to line c (b parallel c), by the transitive property of perpendicular lines, line a will also be perpendicular to line c (a perp c).

Still, the guaranteed relationship is that they are perpendicular to each other.

Each square on the chessboard can be identified by a pair of integers (i, j), where i is the row number and j is the column number, both ranging from 1 to 8. 2.

Since (i + j) values for the squares where the rooks are placed must sum to 72 (an even number), the sum of odd contributions (white squares) must be even. Since an even sum is provided by an even number of odd terms: - Therefore w, the number of white squares (i + j odd), must be even. 8.

Since the error is 162,094.50756 km, which has 6 significant digits, we should round the length to the nearest 100 km to match the precision of the error: 8,104,725.378 km rounded to the nearest 100 km is 8,104,700 km. Now, we express the final length value with the error: Final Length Value = 8,104,700 km ± 162,100 km (rounded to 6 significant digits) To find the percentage error of the final length value, we use the rounded error and the rounded length value: Percentage Error = (Error / Final Length Value) * 100 Percentage Error = (162,100 km / 8,104,700 km) * 100 Percentage Error ≈ 2.000% So, the percentage error when expressing the length of 8,104,725.378 km with the maximum individual percentage uncertainty of 2% is approximately 2.000%, and the final length value expressed with 6 significant digits is boxed{8,104,700} km ± 162,100 km."},{"prompt":"the sequence {a_n}, a_1=1, a_{n+1}a_n=2n, find the general term a_n= ______.","completion":"Given a_{n+1}-a_n=2n, we have a_2-a_1=2times 1, a_3-a_2=2times 2, a_4-a_3=2times 3, ... a_n-a_{n-1}=2(n-1) (ngeqslant 2).

This means: [ triangle ABD quad text{and} quad triangle CBE quad text{are isosceles triangles}. ] 3. **Angles in Isosceles Triangles**: From the isosceles triangle properties and given angle ABC = 120^circ, we need to find angle DBE: [ angle DBA = angle BDA quad text{and} quad angle ECB = angle EBC. ] 4. **Calculate angle DBE**: Summing up, the angles and subtracting the interior angle of the triangle: [ angle DBE = angle DBA + angle EBC - angle ABC. ] Since: [ angle DBA = left(180^circ - alpha right) / 2 quad text{and} quad angle EBC = left(180^circ - beta right) / 2. ] Thus: [ angle DBE = left(frac{180^circ - alpha}{2}right) + left(frac{180^circ - beta}{2}right) - 120^circ. ] 5. **Simplify**: Performing the simplification: [ angle DBE = left(frac{180^circ - alpha + 180^circ - beta}{2}right) - 120^circ = left(frac{360^circ - (alpha + beta)}{2}right) - 120^circ ] Since alpha + beta = 60^circ (as angle ABC = 120^circ in triangle): [ angle DBE = left(frac{360^circ - 60^circ}{2}right) - 120^circ = left(frac{300^circ}{2}right) - 120^circ = 150^circ - 120^circ = 30^circ. ] 6. **Form Right Triangle**: In the right triangle triangle BFD with angle DBF = 30^circ, the ratios of sides in a 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangle are known: [ frac{BD}{DF} = 2. ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{2} ]"},{"prompt":"What is the slope of the line determined by any two solutions to the equation frac{4}{x} + frac{6}{y} = 0?

Since ( a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{1009} ) are the smallest 1009 numbers, and this subset’s sum is positive, it follows that ( a_{1009} ) must be non-negative (at least one of them must be non-negative because their sum is positive). 6. Extend this logic so that ( a_{1010}, a_{1011}, ldots, a_{2020} ) are non-decreasing and thus each will be greater than or equal to ( a_{1009} ), which confirms they are non-negative as well. 7. Now consider the sum ( S ) given by: [ S = (a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{1009}) + (a_{1010} + a_{1011} + cdots + a_{2020}) ] 8. Since ( a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{1009} > 0 ) and all terms ( a_{1010}, a_{1011}, ldots, a_{2020} ) are non-negative, their sum is non-negative: [ a_{1010} + a_{1011} + cdots + a_{2020} geq 0 ] 9. Therefore, [ S = (a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{1009}) + (a_{1010} + a_{1011} + cdots + a_{2020}) > 0 + 0 = 0 ] So, we conclude that the sum of all 2020 numbers is positive: [ boxed{S > 0} ]"},{"prompt":"Given sets A={1,0,1,2} and B={x|0<x<3}, then A∩B=（ ） A: {1, 0, 1} B: {0, 1} C: {1, 1, 2} D: {1, 2}","completion":"Given the sets A = {-1, 0, 1, 2} and B = {x | 0 < x < 3}, we need to find the intersection A cap B, which consists of elements that are present in both sets A and B.

According to the problem: [ lambda = sin x_1 + sin x_2 + sin x_3 + sin x_4 + sin x_5 + cos y_1 + cos y_2 + cos y_3 + cos y_4 ] 2. **Exchange Angles:** By symmetry, if we switch one of the (x_i)'s with (y_1), we can rewrite the same expression as: [ lambda = sin y_1 + sin x_2 + sin x_3 + sin x_4 + sin x_5 + cos x_1 + cos y_2 + cos y_3 + cos y_4 ] 3. **Equating Expressions:** We equate both expressions: [ sin x_1 + cos y_1 = sin y_1 + cos x_1 ] Simplifying this gives: [ sin x_1 - cos x_1 = sin y_1 - cos y_1 ] 4. **Using Trigonometric Identities:** Recognizing that (sin x - cos x = sqrt{2}sinleft(x - 45^circright)): [ sin left(x_1 - 45^circ right) = sin left(y_1 - 45^circ right) ] This implies: [ x_1 = y_1 quad text{or} quad left(x_1 - 45^circright) + left(y_1 - 45^circright) = 180^circ Rightarrow x_1 + y_1 = 270^circ ] 5. **Determining Possible Angles:** Considering that one angle is (120^circ), the possible pairs are (120^circ) and (150^circ). 6. **Solving the System of Equations:** Suppose there are (x) angles of (120^circ) and (y) angles of (150^circ).

Moreover, it can be guaranteed that: sup _{x in[a, b]}left|f_{varepsilon}(x)right| leqslant sup _{x in[a, b]}|f(x)| text {. }","completion":": 1. The goal is to prove that any function ( f ) measurable on the interval ([a, b]) with respect to the Borel (sigma)-algebra (overline{mathscr{B}}[a, b]) can be made continuous by removing appropriate open intervals with an arbitrarily small total length. Furthermore, for every (varepsilon > 0), there exists a continuous function ( f_{varepsilon} ) such that: [ lambdaleft({ x in [a, b] : f(x) neq f_{varepsilon}(x) }right) < varepsilon ] where (lambda) denotes the Lebesgue measure. 2. Let's introduce step functions to approximate ( f ). We define: [ f_{n}(x) = sum_{k=-infty}^{infty} k cdot 2^{-n} Ileft( [k-1]cdot2^{-n} leq f(x) < kcdot2^{-n} right), quad x in [a, b], quad n geq 1 ] where (I) denotes the indicator function. 3. With the above definition, it holds that: [ left| f_{n}(x) - f(x) right| leq 2^{-n} text{ on } [a, b] ] 4. Fix an arbitrarily small (varepsilon > 0). By applying a result similar to Problem II.3.32, we can identify closed sets: [ F_{nk} subseteq left{ x : f_{n}(x) = k cdot 2^{-n} right} ] and ( K_n geq 1 ) such that: [ lambdaleft( bigcup_{k=-K_{n}}^{K_{n}} F_{nk} right) > b - a - varepsilon cdot 2^{-n} ] 5. The sets ( F_{nk} ) do not intersect for different values of ( k ), and ( f_{n} ) is constant on each ( F_{nk} ). Therefore, ( f_{n} ) is continuous on the closed set: [ F_{n} = bigcup_{k=-K_{n}}^{K_{n}} F_{nk} ] 6. Consequently, ( f_{n} ) is continuous on the intersection: [ F = bigcap_{n} F_{n} ] This intersection ( F ) is also closed. 7. The sequence ( f_{n} ) converges uniformly to ( f ) on ( F ). Hence, ( f ) must be continuous on ( F ). 8. The complement of ( F ) in ([a, b]) is open and can be represented as the union of disjoint open intervals: [ [a, b] setminus F = bigcup_{n} (a_{n}, b_{n}) ] 9. The total length of these intervals is computed as: [ lambdaleft( [a, b] setminus F right) = b - a - lambda(F) leq sum_{n geq 1} varepsilon cdot 2^{-n} = varepsilon ] 10. Therefore we can define ( f_{varepsilon}(x) ) as: [ f_{varepsilon}(x) = begin{cases} f(x), & x notin bigcup_{n} (a_{n}, b_{n}) f(a_{n}) + frac{f(b_{n}) - f(a_{n})}{b_{n} - a_{n}}(x - a_{n}), & x in (a_{n}, b_{n}) end{cases} ] 11. Hence, if ( |f(x)| leq c ) on ([a, b]), the same bound holds for the approximation: [ sup_{x in [a, b]} |f_{varepsilon}(x)| leq sup_{x in [a, b]} |f(x)| ] 12. For every (varepsilon > 0), the function ( f(x) ) can be made continuous on the subset ( [a, b] setminus bigcup_{n}(a_{n}, b_{n}) ), where the sum of the lengths of the intervals (sum_{n}(b_{n} - a_{n})) is less than (varepsilon).

How many different seating arrangements are there?","completion":"Let's divide this problem into cases based on whether each person is seated to the left or right of the unoccupied middle seat (6th seat). **Case 1**: Both people sit to the left of the middle seat. We have 5 seats available to the left of the middle seat, and we need to choose 2 non-adjacent ones. This can be done by considering the first five seats as (A, B, C, D, E) and pairing them as follows: (A, C), (A, D), (A, E), (B, D), (B, E), and (C, E). That's a total of 6 combinations for Case 1. **Case 2**: Both people sit to the right of the middle seat. This case is symmetrical to Case 1. With another 5 seats available, we have 6 more combinations. **Case 3**: One person sits to the left of the middle seat, and the other sits to the right. There are 5 options on the left and 5 on the right, giving us (5 times 5 = 25) combinations. However, we must exclude the cases where the people selected the seats that are next to the middle seat, as a person cannot sit in the middle seat. Removing the pair (E, F), where E is the 5th from the left and F is the first to the right of the middle seat, leaves us with (25 - 1 = 24) valid combinations. Adding the combinations from all cases together gives us: [ 6 (text{Case 1}) + 6 (text{Case 2}) + 24 (text{Case 3}) = 6 + 6 + 24 = 36. ] However, the solution seems to be incorrect. We need to account for the more subtle distribution of non-adjacent seats. Let's reconsider the number of ways to arrange two people in non-adjacent seats. For any given seat that the first person chooses (except for the 1st or 10th seats), there are 7 choices for the second person as the neighboring seats would be excluded. If the first person sits on the 1st or 10th seat, then there are 8 choices for the second person. Now we count the number of valid combinations more carefully: **Case 1 and Case 2 (Revised)**: Instead of 6 combinations, we need to calculate the number of ways 2 people can sit on 5 seats without being adjacent: - If either person sits on the first seat, there are 3 ways to seat the second person (3rd, 4th, or 5th seat). - If the first person sits on the second seat, there are 2 ways for the second person (4th or 5th seat). - If the first person sits on the third seat, there is 1 way for the second person (5th seat). This gives us (3+2+1 = 6) ways for each side (left or right of the middle seat). **Case 3 (Revised)**: If the first person sits on the 1st or 10th seat, there are 8 choices for the second person. For the remaining 8 seats (2nd to 5th on the left and 7th to 10th on the right), there are 7 choices. Therefore, the total is (2 times 8 + 8 times 7).

We need to analyze the perpendiculars drawn from one point to the lines connecting the other four points, which will give us the total number of intersection points of these perpendiculars. 3. First, calculate the number of lines formed by connecting each pair of points out of the five given points: [ binom{5}{2} = frac{5 cdot 4}{2 cdot 1} = 10 ] Thus, there are 10 lines formed by connecting every pair of the five points. 4. Each time we choose three points out of the five, a unique triangle is formed: [ binom{5}{3} = frac{5 cdot 4 cdot 3}{3 cdot 2 cdot 1} = 10 ] So, there are 10 triangles formed by choosing three points among the five. 5. After forming a triangle, we need to count the perpendiculars from each point. Consider four points out of five: [ binom{4}{2} = frac{4 cdot 3}{2 cdot 1} = 6 ] This means 6 lines can be formed by choosing any two out of these four points. Each of these four points can act as the point from which perpendiculars are drawn, therefore: [ 6 text{ lines} times 5 text{ points} = 30 text{ perpendiculars total} ] 6. The possible maximum number of intersection points for these perpendiculars without other considerations can be calculated as: [ binom{30}{2} = frac{30 cdot 29}{2 cdot 1} = 435 ] This assumes that any two perpendiculars intersect. 7. Adjusting for overcounting: - Each of the 10 lines, formed from choosing pairs, has three parallel perpendiculars resulting in no new intersections. Thus, we subtract: [ 10 times binom{3}{2} = 10 times 3 = 30 ] - Each of the 10 triangles shares the same point of intersection from three perpendicular heights, thus: [ 10 times (binom{3}{2} - 1) = 10 times 2 = 20 ] - Each of the 6 lines passing through one of the five points does not count: [ 5 times binom{6}{2} = 5 times 15 = 75 ] 8.

Let these sums be denoted by (S_1), (S_2), and (S_3). 2. **Sum of all elements:** The sum of all elements from (1) to (1998) is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: [ S = sum_{i=1}^{1998} i = frac{1998 cdot 1999}{2} = 999 cdot 1999 ] 3. **Expressing the total sum:** Since the total sum (S) is partitioned into three classes, we have: [ S = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 ] Given the conditions, we can write: [ S_1 = 2000k, quad S_2 = 3999ell, quad S_3 = 5998m ] for some (k, ell, m in mathbb{N}).

In order to find the length of chord AD, which divides the hexagon, we consider the addition of angles and use the cosine rule in triangle ABD.

Let's consider the coloring of the cubes for each half separately. For the first half: - The two larger faces are colored red. - The remaining faces are colored green. When this half is cut into 64 smaller cubes, only the cubes on the outer layer will have colored faces. The cubes on the inside will have no colored faces. Since the two larger faces are colored red, the cubes along these faces will have one red face each. The cubes on the edges will have two colored faces (one red and one green), and the cubes on the corners will have three colored faces (two green and one red). For the second half: - Two smaller adjacent faces are colored green. - The remaining faces are colored red. Similarly, when this half is cut into 64 smaller cubes, only the cubes on the outer layer will have colored faces. The cubes along the two smaller adjacent faces will have one green face each. The cubes on the edges will have two colored faces (one green and one red), and the cubes on the corners will have three colored faces (two red and one green). To find the number of cubes with only one colored face each, we need to count the cubes on the faces that are not on an edge or corner for both halves. For each half, there are 4 faces that contribute to cubes with one colored face each (excluding the edges and corners). Since each face is part of a 4x4 grid of smaller cubes (after being cut into 64 cubes), the interior 2x2 grid will have cubes with only one colored face. That's 4 cubes per face. So for each half, we have: 4 faces * 4 cubes per face = 16 cubes with one colored face each.

Let u_n denote the number of ways to tile the 2 times n rectangle. 2. **Initial Conditions:** - For n=1: There is only one way to place a horizontal domino, hence u_1 = 1. - For n=2: There are two ways to tile the rectangle, either by placing two horizontal dominos or two vertical dominos side by side, hence u_2 = 2. 3. **Recurrence Relation:** - Consider the tiling for a 2 times n rectangle. We analyze the placement of the domino at the rightmost end: - If the rightmost domino is placed vertically, it will occupy the last column, leaving a 2 times (n-1) rectangle to be tiled. Hence, there are u_{n-1} ways to tile the 2 times (n-1) rectangle. - If the rightmost two dominos are placed horizontally, they will occupy the last two columns, leaving a 2 times (n-2) rectangle to be tiled. Hence, there are u_{n-2} ways to tile the 2 times (n-2) rectangle. - Combining these possibilities, we obtain the recurrence relation: [ u_n = u_{n-1} + u_{n-2} ] 4. **Identifying the Sequence:** The recurrence relation u_n = u_{n-1} + u_{n-2} is identical to the recurrence relation for the Fibonacci sequence.

Let's call the number of these people (3 times 500 = 1500) and the fraction of the maximum donation they gave as (f). So, each of these 1500 people donated (f times 1200). The total amount of money from these 1500 people is: (1500 times f times 1200) The sum of the donations from the 500 people and the 1500 people is 40% of the total money raised, which is 3,750,000.

Megoldás: Az állítást 8 lépésben bizonyítjuk. Egy tetszőleges S alakzatnak a fenti mathbf{T} transzformáció szerinti képét a rövidség kedvéért S_{mathbf{T}}-vel jelöljük. 1. **Definíció**: Ha mathbf{T} a síknak kölcsönösen egyértelmű ponttranszformációja, S és S^{'} pedig a sík két tetszőleges alakzata, akkor S_{mathbf{T}} és S_{mathbf{T}}^{'} alakzatának pontosan annyi közös pontja lesz, mint az S és S^{'} alakzatoknak van. Két nem metsző (párhuzamos) egyenes mathbf{T} szerinti képe tehát két nem metsző alakzat lesz. Ha mathbf{T} transzformációról még azt is tudjuk, hogy egyenest egyenesbe visz, akkor párhuzamos egyenespár képe párhuzamos egyenespár. 2. **Egyenesek metszéspontja**: Kölcsönösen egyértelmű ponttranszformáció alakzatok közös pontját a képalkzatok közös pontjába viszi, tehát egyenesek metszéspontjának a képe a kép-egyenesek metszéspontja. Ebből következően a paralelogramma párhuzamos oldalegyeneseit egy kölcsönösen egyértelmű, egyenestartó ponttranszformáció párhuzamos oldalegyenesekbe, a csúcsokat (nem párhuzamos oldalegyenesek metszéspontjait) a képegyenesek metszéspontjaiba viszi, tehát paralelogramma képe paralelogramma. 3. **Kör és érintője**: Ha e egyenes a K kört érinti, és ha a mathbf{T} transzformáció kört körbe visz, akkor az e_{mathbf{T}} egyenes érinteni fogja a K_{mathbf{T}} kört, mathbf{T} tehát kört érintő egyenest a képkört érintő egyenesbe visz. 4. **Pont körön kívül**: Ha P a K körön kívül fekszik, akkor P-ből húzható egyenes a kört érinti. Ezért a P_{mathbf{T}}-ból húzott e_{mathbf{T}} egyenes is érinteni fogja a K_{mathbf{T}} kört, tehát P_{mathbf{T}} a K_{mathbf{T}} körön kívül lesz. Így a kör külső pontjai a kép kör külső pontjaiba, a körvonal pontjai a kép körvonal pontjaiba, a kör belső pontjainak képei pedig a kép kör belső pontjaiba mennek át. Ha most húzunk egy kört az A B szakasz mint átmérő fölött, akkor az A B egyenesnek a körön belül lévő pontjai lesznek az A B szakasz belső pontjai, így a mathbf{T} transzformáció ezeket a pontokat a képkör belső pontjaiba viszi, vagyis az A_{mathbf{T}} B_{mathbf{T}} szakasz belső pontjaiba. Ebből következik, hogy az A B szakasz pontjainak képei az A_{mathbf{T}} B_{mathbf{T}} szakasz pontjainak képei lesznek. 5. **Kör átmérője**: Ha A és B a K kör két átellenes pontja, és az e egyenes a K kört az A pontban, az f egyenes pedig a B pontban érinti, akkor az e_{mathbf{T}} és f_{mathbf{T}} egyenesek is érinteni fogják a K_{mathbf{T}} kört. Mivel e párhuzamos f-fel, e_{mathbf{T}} is párhuzamos lesz f_{mathbf{T}}-vel. Ezért e_{mathbf{T}} és f_{mathbf{T}} átellenes pontokban érinti a K_{mathbf{T}} kört. Ez alapján A és B képe valójában a kép-kör két átellenes pontja lesz. 6. **Kör középpontja**: Húzunk egy egyenest a K kör középpontján keresztül, amely a kört két átellenes pontjában metszi. Ennek az egyenesnek a képe áthalad a K_{mathbf{T}} kör középpontján. Ugyanígy ezzel a módszerrel igazolhatjuk, hogy másik egyenes is áthalad a K_{mathbf{T}} kör középpontján. E két egyenes metszéspontja épp a K kör középpontja, ami a K_{mathbf{T}} kép-kör középpontja lesz. Vagyis a mathbf{T} transzformáció bármely kör középpontját a képkör középpontjába viszi. 7. **Szakaszok eltolása és forgatása**: Ha két szakasz egyenlő, akkor egy párhuzamos eltolással és egy elforgatással átvihető egyik a másikba. Láttuk, hogy egy szakasz eltolásának a képsíkon is a képszakasz valamilyen párhuzamos eltolása, elforgatásának pedig a képszakasz valamilyen elforgatása felel meg. Ebből következik, hogy egyenlő hosszú szakaszok képei egyenlő hosszú szakaszok. 8. **Racionális arányú osztópontok**: Ha az A B szakaszt n egyenlő részre osztjuk, akkor az osztópontok képei a képszakaszt n egyenlő részre bontják, hiszen egyenlő hosszú szakaszok képei egyenlő hosszúak. Ha most az A B és C D szakaszok aránya racionális, mondjuk A B : C D = n : m, akkor az A B szakasz elosztható n, a C D szakasz m egyenlő részre úgy, hogy a szomszédos osztópontok közötti szakaszok a két szakaszon egyenlő hosszúak legyenek. A T transzformáció egyenlő szakaszokat egyenlő hosszú darabokba visz, tehát az A B és C D szakasz képei is feloszthatók ugyanúgy n, ill. m egyenlő részre. Tehát A_{mathbf{T}} B_{mathbf{T}} : C_{mathbf{T}} D_{mathbf{T}} = n : m = A B : C D. Ez alapján beláthatjuk, hogy ha az A B C háromszög oldalainak aránya A B : B C : C A = 3 : 4 : 5, akkor ugyanez igaz az A_{mathbf{T}} B_{mathbf{T}} : B_{mathbf{T}} C_{mathbf{T}} : C_{mathbf{T}} A_{mathbf{T}} arányra is. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"80 is 16.666666666666668% of what number?","completion":"To find the number that 80 is 16.666666666666668% of, you can set up the following equation: 80 = 16.666666666666668% * X First, convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 16.666666666666668% = 0.16666666666666668 Now, the equation becomes: 80 = 0.16666666666666668 * X To solve for X, divide both sides of the equation by 0.16666666666666668: X = 80 / 0.16666666666666668 X = 480 Therefore, 80 is boxed{16.666666666666668%} of 480."},{"prompt":"the Cartesian coordinate system, define the rectilinear distance between points ( P(x_1, y_1) ) and ( Q(x_2, y_2) ) as ( d(P, Q) = |x_1 x_2| + |y_1 y_2| ).

Thus, ( f(0) = 0 ). 3. Reevaluate the function for ( x = 1 ): [ f(y+f(1)) = 2f(y) + f(1) ] Assume ( f(y) = cy ): [ f(y+2) = 2cf(y) + 2 ] Requiring ( cy = c(y+2) - 2 = 2cy + 2 ).

Since 7>1, the function y=log_7(x) is increasing. Thus for x>6, log_7(x) is greater than log_7(6). So, we have log_7(6)<log_7(7). Similarly, since 6>1, the function y=log_6(x) is increasing. Therefore, for x=7, log_6(7) is greater than log_6(6)=1. Hence, log_7(6)<1<log_6(7). So, option A is true. **Option B**: The function f(x)=1.01^x is an exponential function with a base greater than 1, which means it is increasing. As a result, if x_2>x_1, we have 1.01^{x_2} > 1.01^{x_1}. Therefore, 1.01^{3.5} should be greater than 1.01^{3.4}, which contradicts B. Hence, option B is not true. **Option C**: The function f(x)=x^{alpha} with alpha>0 is an increasing function for x>0. Since 3.5>3.4 and alpha=0.3>0, it follows that 3.5^{0.3}>3.4^{0.3}, which contradicts C. Thus, option C is not true. **Option D**: For the function f(x)=log_{0.4}(x), we note that since the base 0.4 is less than 1, the function is decreasing. This implies that if x_2>x_1, then log_{0.4}(x_2) < log_{0.4}(x_1). Since 6>4, we should have log_{0.4}(6)<log_{0.4}(4), which contradicts D. Therefore, option D is not true.

Points ( K ) and ( L ) are located on sides (BC) and (CD) respectively, such that the ratios ( frac{BK}{KC} = frac{CL}{LD} ). Let ( k = frac{BK}{BC} ). Therefore, we also have ( frac{CL}{CD} = k ). This implies that ( K ) divides ( BC ) in the ratio ( k : 1-k ) and ( L ) divides ( CD ) in the same ratio. 2. **Projection onto a Perpendicular to ( BD )**: To simplify the proof, let us project the triangle ( AKL ) onto a line perpendicular to the diagonal ( BD ). In this projection, we denote the images of points ( A ), ( K ), and ( L ) by ( A' ), ( K' ), and ( L' ) respectively. 3. **Projection Properties**: Under this projection, the points ( B ), ( K ), and ( L ) map to points ( B' ), ( K' ), and ( L' ) such that: [ B'K' = k cdot A'B' quad text{and} quad B'L' = (1-k) cdot A'B' ] 4. **Distance Calculations**: Adding the distances from ( B' ) to ( K' ) and ( L' ) yields: [ B'K' + B'L' = k cdot A'B' + (1-k) cdot A'B' = A'B' ] This result implies that ( K' ) and ( L' ) on the projected line are such that the combined distances from ( B' ) to ( K' ) and from ( B' ) to ( L' ) equal the distance from ( A' ) to ( B' ). 5. **Center of Mass Calculation in the Projection**: Since the combined distances from ( B' ) to ( K' ) and ( L' ) form a straight line segment equal to the entirety of ( A'B' ), the center of mass of points ( A' ), ( K' ), and ( L' ) must coincide with ( B' ). This follows from the fact that the center of mass of points split equally on a line falls at the midpoint (( B' )). 6. **Projection and Center of Mass**: Since the center of mass remains invariant under projection, the center of mass of ( triangle AKL ) in the original parallelogram must also lie on the line ( BD ). # Conclusion: Therefore, we have shown that the center of mass of ( triangle AKL ) lies on the diagonal ( BD ) of the parallelogram ( ABCD ): [ boxed{text{The center of mass of } triangle AKL text{ lies on diagonal } BD.} ]"},{"prompt":"the figure, ABCD is a square of side length 2.

Any other median can be calculated using Apollonius's theorem. 2. **Use Apollonius's theorem:** Apollonius's theorem states that in any triangle, the length of the median can be determined by: [ m_a^2 = frac{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}{4} ] where ( m_a ) is the median to side ( a ), and ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are the sides of the triangle. 3. **Setup equations:** Since one leg ( a ) is 10 and the shortest median m_b is 13 in the right triangle where b is another leg and c is the hypotenuse, we use Apollonius's theorem to write: [ m_b^2 = frac{2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2}{4} ] Plugging in the known values: [ 13^2 = frac{2 cdot 10^2 + 2 cdot c^2 - b^2}{4} ] Simplifying, we get: [ 169 = frac{2 cdot 100 + 2c^2 - b^2}{4} ] [ 169 = frac{200 + 2c^2 - b^2}{4} ] [ 676 = 200 + 2c^2 - b^2 ] 4. **Sum of squares in a right triangle:** In a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem states: [ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ] So we use the variable ( b ) directly and substituting ( a = 10 ): [ 10^2 + b^2 = c^2 ] [ 100 + b^2 = c^2 ] 5. **Substitute into Apollonius equation:** Let’s substitute ( c^2 ) from the Pythagorean theorem into Apollonius's theorem: [ 676 = 200 + 2(100 + b^2) - b^2 ] [ 676 = 200 + 200 + 2b^2 - b^2 ] [ 676 = 400 + b^2 ] [ b^2 = 276 ] 6. **Solve for b:** [ b = sqrt{276} = sqrt{4 cdot 69} = 2 sqrt{69} ] Now we calculate: [ c^2 = 100 + 276 = 376 ] [ c = sqrt{376} = sqrt{4 cdot 94} = 2 sqrt{94} ] 7. **Area of the triangle:** The area ( A ) of a right triangle is: [ A = frac{1}{2} times a times b ] Substituting ( a = 10 ) and ( b = 2sqrt{69} ), we get: [ A = frac{1}{2} times 10 times 2sqrt{69} ] [ A = frac{1}{2} times 20 times sqrt{69} ] [ A = 10 times sqrt{69} ] Calculate ( sqrt{69} approx 8.3 ), gives us approximately: [ A approx 10 times 8.3 = 83 ] The area should be verified correctly.

Now, let's find out how much work A and B would have completed in 3 days working together without C: Work done by A in 3 days = 3 * (1/6) = 1/2 of the job Work done by B in 3 days = 3 * (1/8) = 3/8 of the job Total work done by A and B in 3 days = 1/2 + 3/8 = 4/8 + 3/8 = 7/8 of the job This means that C's efficiency must account for the remaining 1/8 of the job to be completed in 3 days, so C's efficiency is 1/8 of the job per day, which is the same as B's efficiency. Now, let's calculate the total efficiency units for A, B, and C: A's efficiency units = 6 days * 1/6 = 1 unit B's efficiency units = 8 days * 1/8 = 1 unit C's efficiency units = 3 days * 1/8 = 3/8 units Total efficiency units = A + B + C = 1 + 1 + 3/8 = 2 + 3/8 = 19/8 units Now, let's calculate the share of the total wage for each person based on their efficiency units: A's share = (A's efficiency units / Total efficiency units) * Total wage A's share = (1 / (19/8)) * 2400 = (8/19) * 2400 = 8 * 126.32 = Rs. 1010.53 (approximately) B's share = (B's efficiency units / Total efficiency units) * Total wage B's share = (1 / (19/8)) * 2400 = (8/19) * 2400 = 8 * 126.32 = Rs. 1010.53 (approximately) C's share = (C's efficiency units / Total efficiency units) * Total wage C's share = (3/8 / (19/8)) * 2400 = (3/19) * 2400 = 3 * 126.32 = Rs. 378.95 (approximately) Therefore, the payment for C should be approximately Rs. boxed{378.95} if the total wage is divided based on each person's efficiency."},{"prompt":"Points D and E divide the sides AC and AB of an equilateral triangle ABC in the ratios AD:DC = BE:EA = 1:2.

Let's denote the intersection points of the segment (AF) with (BD) and (CE) as (P) and (Q) respectively. 3. **Identification of Equal Segments**: Given the symmetry and properties of the equilateral triangle, ( triangle OPQ ) is an equilateral triangle due to the specific ratios at which the sides are divided. This follows from Problem 1.3 which states that certain specific parallel segments cut by diagonals intersecting at a point create similar ratios and symmetries. 4. **Using Ratios to Find Other Ratios**: Utilizing the properties proven in Problem 1.3, we have: [ frac{AP}{PF} = frac{3}{4} ] and [ frac{AQ}{QF} = 6:1. ] Combining these results, we can write: [ AP : PQ : QF = 3 : 3 : 1. ] 5. **Identifying Relationships**: This leads to: [ AP = PQ = OP. ] Thus, (triangle OPQ) is indeed an equilateral triangle. 6. **Calculating Angles**: Since ( triangle OPQ ) is equilateral, [ angle AOQ = 60^circ. ] Additionally, we divide the interior angles of an equilateral triangle equally: [ angle AOP = frac{180^circ - angle PAO}{2} = 30^circ. ] 7. **Final Angle Calculation**: The angles formed relate as follows: [ angle AOC = angle AOP + angle POQ = 60^circ + 30^circ = 90^circ. ] Consequently, [ angle AOC = 90^circ. ] # Conclusion Thus, we have proved that (angle AOC) is indeed (90^circ).

At x = -1, the slope of the tangent (m) is: m = f'(-1) = 3(-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 1 = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2. The coordinates of the point of tangency on f(x) at x = -1 are (-1, f(-1)). Substitute x = -1 into f(x) to find the y-coordinate: f(-1) = (-1)^3 + (-1)^2 - 1 + 3 = -1 + 1 - 1 + 3 = 2. The point of tangency is (-1, 2). Using the point-slope form for the equation of a line, the equation of the tangent line at x = -1 is: y - 2 = 2(x + 1), which simplifies to: y = 2x + 4. Since the tangent to f(x) is also tangent to the parabola y = 2px^2, their tangent lines should be identical. Therefore, setting the two equations equal to each other, we obtain: 2px^2 = 2x + 4. For these two to be tangent, there must be exactly one solution for x. This means the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be zero. The discriminant Delta of the equation 2px^2 - 2x - 4 = 0 is: Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4(2p)(-4) = 4 + 32p = 0. Solve for p: 4 + 32p = 0 Rightarrow 32p = -4 Rightarrow p = -frac{1}{8}.

Since E, F, G, and H are midpoints of the sides of the rectangle ABCD, the lengths of the segments EH and FG will be equal to the width and length of the rectangle, respectively. Therefore, EH = 20 m and FG = 28 m. We are given that one of the diagonals of the rhombus is 12 m. Without loss of generality, let's assume that this diagonal is EH. So, EH = 12 m. However, we previously stated that EH should be equal to the width of the rectangle, which is 20 m. There seems to be a contradiction here. Let's assume that the given diagonal of 12 m is actually FG, which is the diagonal that runs parallel to the length of the rectangle. So, FG = 12 m. Now, we can find the area of the rhombus using the formula for the area of a rhombus, which is: Area of rhombus = (d1 * d2) / 2 where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. We know d1 (FG) = 12 m, but we need to find d2 (EH). Since E and H are midpoints of AB and DA, respectively, EH will be equal to the width of the rectangle. So, d2 (EH) = 20 m. Now we can calculate the area of the rhombus: Area of rhombus = (12 m * 20 m) / 2 Area of rhombus = 240 m² / 2 Area of rhombus = 120 m² Next, we calculate the total area of the rectangle: Area of rectangle = length * width Area of rectangle = 28 m * 20 m Area of rectangle = 560 m² Finally, we find the ratio of the area of the rhombus to the total area of the rectangle: Ratio = Area of rhombus / Area of rectangle Ratio = 120 m² / 560 m² Ratio = 3 / 14 So, the ratio of the area of the rhombus to the total area of the rectangle is boxed{3:14} ."},{"prompt":"85% of the population of a city is 85,000.

Using vector addition and subtraction, we can deduce that overrightarrow{OP} cdot overrightarrow{{F_2}P}=overrightarrow{{F_2}O} cdot overrightarrow{{F_2}P}, which implies that OP=OF_2=c=OF_1, proving that PF_1 perp PF_2. Given the condition, we have angle PF_1F_2=30^circ. Using the sine of this angle, we can find the eccentricity. Step-by-step solution: 1. From overrightarrow{OP} cdot overrightarrow{{F_2}P}=overrightarrow{{F_2}O} cdot overrightarrow{{F_2}P}, we have (overrightarrow{OP}+overrightarrow{{F_2}O}) cdot overrightarrow{{F_2}P}=0. 2. This simplifies to (overrightarrow{OP}+overrightarrow{{F_2}O}) cdot (overrightarrow{OP}-overrightarrow{O{F_2}})=0, which further simplifies to {overrightarrow{OP}}^2-{overrightarrow{O{F_2}}^2}=0, implying that OP=OF_2=c=OF_1. 3. Thus, PF_1 perp PF_2 and triangle PF_1F_2 is a right triangle. 4. Since |PF_1|=sqrt{3}|PF_2|, we have angle PF_1F_2=30^circ. 5. By the definition of a hyperbola, PF_1-PF_2=2a, which gives us PF_2=frac{2a}{sqrt{3}-1}. 6. Using the sine of 30^circ, we have sin 30^circ = frac{1}{2} = frac{PF_2}{F_1F_2} = frac{frac{2a}{sqrt{3}-1}}{2c} = frac{a}{c(sqrt{3}-1)}. 7. This leads to 2a=c(sqrt{3}-1), and finally, frac{c}{a}=sqrt{3}+1. Therefore, the eccentricity of the hyperbola is boxed{sqrt{3}+1}."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=x^{2}+ax+6.

Find one ordered tuple (a,b,c,d) that satisfies the above conditions. __________, and the total number of such ordered tuples (a,b,c,d) is __________.","completion":"To solve this problem, let's analyze each condition to see which one could be the true statement and proceed with a case-by-case discussion. - Case 1: Suppose a=1 is the correct statement. Since a=1, it means b, c, and d cannot be 1. But then the second statement, b neq 1, is also true, which contradicts the premise that only one statement can be true. Thus, this scenario isn't possible, and a=1 cannot be the true statement. - Case 2: Suppose b neq 1 is the correct statement. If statement 2 is the true statement, a, c, and d can be 1. However, since only one statement is true, neither c=2 nor d neq 4 can be correct. This leads us to the following combinations: (1,3,4,2), (1,4,3,2), and so on. However, this case also provides multiple combinations where other statements can appear true. To ensure no other statement seems valid, we must carefully construct the combination so that the constraints from statements 3 and 4 are violated. Therefore, this case needs careful permutation where b is not 1, c is not 2, and d is 4. Combining these constraints, we can derive the combinations that b is either 3 or 4, and c is either 1 or 4, and d must be 4. Thus, we can get (1,3,4,2) as a valid solution. - Case 3: Suppose c=2 is the correct statement. If c=2 is the true statement, the rest (a, b, and d) cannot be 2, thus we can form ordered tuples without using 2 for these positions. But following this path would also lead to several combinations, some of which make b neq 1 or d neq 4 true as well. Thus, this case must be constructed such that b = 1 and d = 4. With these constraints, we can form (3,1,2,4) as a valid solution. - Case 4: Suppose d neq 4 is the correct statement. With d neq 4, the other positions can't use 4, and b has to be 1 since b neq 1 cannot be true, and neither can c=2. Thus, we can find that (3,1,4,2) is a valid example. Upon examining each case, we can now compile a list of valid combinations: - (1,3,4,2) - (3,1,2,4) - (3,1,4,2) - And others that fit the conditions that only one of the statements is true. To find the total number of arrangements, we can systematically list and count each valid ordered tuple. Considering the above cases and constraints, we can conclude that there are 6 valid ordered tuples: - (3,2,1,4) - (2,3,1,4) - (3,1,2,4) - (3,1,4,2) - (4,1,3,2) - (2,1,4,3) For the purposes of filling in the first blank in the question, we can choose any one of these tuples: Thus, our final answer is: - Ordered tuple: (3,2,1,4); - Total number of such tuples: boxed{6}"},{"prompt":"The base of a triangle is 20 inches.

Consider the problem where we need to find the minimum possible sum of all numbers in a ( 5 times 5 ) table such that the sums of natural numbers in each row and each column are all different. 2. Since the entries in the table are natural numbers, the minimum sum for any row or column is at least 5 (since 1 is the smallest natural number, and there are 5 entries per row/column). Additionally, because all these sums must be different, the smallest set of unique sums must be consecutive integers starting from 5. 3. The smallest possible set of sums that are different and covers all 5 rows and 5 columns is ({5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}). 4. The sum of this set of sums is: [ 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 ] 5.

Since each number in the table is counted once in a row and once in a column, the total sum ( S ) of the numbers in the table is half of the sum of all row and column sums: [ S = frac{95}{2} = 47.5 ] Since ( S ) must be a natural number, and the smallest integer greater than or equal to 47.5 is 48, it follows that: [ S geq 48 ] 7.

Приведи конкретные факты и доказательства","completion":"Власть существенно влияла на развитие культуры на Руси в различные исторические периоды. Приведем несколько конкретных фактов и доказательств: 1. Становление православия: Власть вводила и поддерживала христианство на Руси, что повлекло за собой значительные изменения в культуре. Например, при князе Владимире в 988 году было принято христианство, что привело к появлению церквей и монастырей, которые стали центрами культурного развития. 2. Московское централизованное государство: Московская держава развивала центральную власть и контроль над регионами. Это способствовало распространению культурных норм и традиций во всей стране. Например, Иван IV Грозный проводил реформы, направленные на единое управление культурой, в том числе создание первой в России печатной практики. 3. Петровские реформы: Петр I Большой провел серию реформ в 17-18 веках, направленных на сближение с Европой. Он ввел обязательное ношение западной одежды, запретил носить косы и бороды, строил Европейский стиль архитектуры и искусства. Таким образом, Петровское правление сделало значительный вклад в формирование новой культуры и идентичности. 4. Советская власть: Власть Советского Союза оказала огромное влияние на развитие культуры в 20 веке, особенно после Октябрьской революции в 1917 году. Советское правительство пропагандировало социалистические идеалы и создало массовые культурные институты, такие как кинематограф, литература и искусство, которые совершенствовались в соответствии с политическими целями и идеологией государства. Это лишь некоторые примеры, показывающие, как власть оказывала влияние на культуру на Руси в течение истории.

Through thick mud and mosquito-infested forests, I trekked 15 km, filled with anticipation at every glimpse of a new species flying by. However, my excitement was often overshadowed by the grim reality of the webs filled with dead birds enveloping me. In one of these tragic webs, I stumbled upon a red-throated warbler, a national second-class protected bird. Holding her delicate body in my hands, I felt a mix of emotions - the joy of rescuing her and the sorrow of witnessing the loss of so many others. Carefully freeing her wings from the dark, thin thread, she unfurled her feathers and prepared to take flight once again. As a volunteer at Yeyu Nature, a wildlife conservation center, I have dedicated two years to removing these deadly nets. While I have managed to save a dozen birds, I have also mourned the loss of many more, as tens of them died even after my rescue efforts. Although discouraging, the relentless presence of bird traps in new villages, districts, and provinces only fueled my determination and raised the question - how can I possibly eliminate every bird trap in the world?

Hoping to revive it, I gently nurtured and planted it under a balsam fir tree before my house. A week later, the spike moss flourished, revitalized by generous rainwater. Breaking free from the confinement of the thick glass that hindered its growth, it found its unrestrained spirit. That spike moss became a symbol of my own journey. Enveloped in environmental pessimism, I, too, had become trapped. But unlike the moss, I possessed the power to shatter the limitations imposed upon me.

In workshops for primary school children, we venture into Shanghai's forests, meticulously removing illegal bird nets and implementing preventative measures such as bird collision prevention stickers. I teach the children the importance of freeing these trapped birds while taking personal risks. I firmly believe that modern cities will eventually foster harmonious coexistence and establish new survival ethics. The ecological bottle once limited me and my spike moss alike. It is in shattering the constraints that society or I have enforced upon myself that I genuinely connect with the wilderness.
