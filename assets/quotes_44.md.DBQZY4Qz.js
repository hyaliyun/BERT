The line (x = 2y) intersects the line (y = 3) at point (x = 2 times 3 = 6), which is outside the rectangle, so the intersection point along (x = 4) (rectangle's right boundary) is where (4 = 2y) or (y = 2), giving the point ((4,2)). The area of the triangle bounded by (x = 0), (y = 2), and the line (x = 2y) can be calculated: - Base of the triangle is on the y-axis, from (y = 0) to (y = 2), so the length is 2. - Height of the triangle (along (x)) is from (x = 0) to (x = 2 times 2 = 4), so the height is 4. - The area of the triangle is (frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times 2 times 4 = 4).

This corresponds to the x values in the original function y = 2^x + 1 that yield a y value less than 1. Now, let's set up our inequality with y: y = 2^x + 1 < 1 This requires 2^x to be negative, which is impossible as the function 2^x is always positive. However, we can determine the range of values for y that are greater than 1: For x < 0 in the original function: 0 < 2^x < 1 Adding 1 to all parts of the inequality, we get : 1 < 2^x + 1 < 2 Since f^{-1}(x) corresponds to the x-values of the original function, we are looking for the y-values in the original function that fall in the interval (1, 2). Knowing that the inverse function will switch x and y values, we seek the interval of y (or the output of f^{-1}(x)) that makes the original function output a value between 1 and 2.

How much will his total profit be?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 9 pairs of socks with the 10% discount. The cost of one pair of socks is 2, so the cost of 9 pairs is: 9 pairs * 2/pair = 18 The 10% discount on the 18 is: 10% of 18 = 0.10 * 18 = 1.80 So, the total cost after the discount is: 18 - 1.80 = 16.20 Now, let's calculate the selling price for the 4 pairs of socks with a 25% profit. The cost of 4 pairs of socks without discount is: 4 pairs * 2/pair = 8 The 25% profit on the 8 is: 25% of 8 = 0.25 * 8 = 2 So, the total selling price for the 4 pairs of socks before tax is: 8 + 2 = 10 Now, let's calculate the selling price for the 5 pairs of socks with a 0.2 profit each. The profit for 5 pairs is: 5 pairs * 0.2/pair = 1 The total selling price for the 5 pairs of socks before tax is: 10 (cost of 5 pairs at 2 each) + 1 = 11 Now, let's calculate the sales tax for both sets of socks. For the 4 pairs of socks: 5% of 10 = 0.05 * 10 = 0.50 So, the total selling price for the 4 pairs of socks after tax is: 10 + 0.50 = 10.50 For the 5 pairs of socks: 5% of 11 = 0.05 * 11 = 0.55 So, the total selling price for the 5 pairs of socks after tax is: 11 + 0.55 = 11.55 Now, let's calculate the total selling price and the total profit.

The tax on clothing is 10%, so she paid 5 in tax for clothing. She spent 25% on other items, which is 25. The tax on other items is 20%, so she paid 5 in tax for other items. The total tax she paid is 10% of the total amount (excluding taxes), which is 10 (since 10% of 100 is 10). We have already accounted for 5 (clothing tax) + 5 (other items tax) = 10 total tax.

From the triangles formed by the diagonals, we notice that each of these n-2 triangles is one of the regions formed by the diagonals. 5. Consider the process of marking points: - Each such triangle needs to contain at least one marked point. - If these points are chosen such that they lie within the divided triangles formed by one vertex’s diagonals, then any triangle formed by the vertices of the n-gon will contain at least one of these marked points. 6. We essentialize this by ensuring: - In each of the n-2 regions formed by drawing all diagonals from one vertex, place one marked point. - This guarantees that any triangle formed by selecting three vertices of the n-gon will intersect at least one of these regions and thus contain a marked point. 7. Therefore, the minimum number of points necessary to guarantee that every possible triangle formed by the vertices of the n-gon contains at least one marked point is n-2.

Start by substituting (a = x^2, b = y^2, c = z^2) where (x, y, z > 1). Consequently, we have (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9). 2. It follows that [ 1 < x^2, y^2, z^2 < 9. ] 3. Given (ab + bc + ca leq 3(sqrt{ab} + sqrt{bc} + sqrt{ca})), we need to show the equivalent inequality [ x^2 y^2 + y^2 z^2 + z^2 x^2 leq 3(xy + yz + zx). ] 4.

The order of rings on each finger is significant, but it is not required that each finger have a ring. Find the leftmost three nonzero digits of n.","completion":"To solve for n, the number of possible five-ring arrangements on the four fingers of one hand, we follow these steps: 1. **Choosing the Rings**: First, we need to select which 5 out of the 8 distinguishable rings will be used. This can be done in binom{8}{5} ways. The binomial coefficient binom{8}{5} represents the number of ways to choose 5 items out of 8 without regard to the order in which they are chosen. Calculating this gives us: [ binom{8}{5} = frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = frac{8 times 7 times 6}{3 times 2 times 1} = 56. ] 2. **Ordering the Rings**: Once the rings are chosen, they can be arranged in 5! (5 factorial) ways. This is because the order of rings on each finger is significant. Calculating 5! gives us: [ 5! = 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 120. ] 3. **Distributing the Rings Among the Fingers**: The distribution of the rings among the four fingers can be thought of as placing 5 balls into 4 compartments (representing the fingers). To separate these compartments, we use 3 dividers. The total number of objects to arrange is then 5 balls + 3 dividers = 8 objects. The number of ways to arrange these objects is binom{8}{3}, since we are choosing positions for the 3 dividers out of the 8 total positions. Calculating binom{8}{3} gives us: [ binom{8}{3} = frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = frac{8 times 7 times 6}{3 times 2 times 1} = 56. ] 4. **Calculating the Total Number of Arrangements**: To find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to choose the rings, the number of ways to order them, and the number of ways to distribute them among the fingers.

Let the zeros of f(x) be x_{1}, x_{2}, and x_{3}. According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of a cubic equation x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 is given by -(b/a), where a=1 for our function. Therefore, we have: [x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} = -frac{b}{1} = 0] This implies that b = 0, and thus, the function simplifies to: [fleft(xright) = x^{3} + cx + c] 2. The derivative of f(x), which is f'left(xright) = 3x^{2} + c, helps us find the critical points of the function. For f(x) to have three zeros, f'(x) must equal 0 at two points, which implies the function has two critical points. 3. Solving f'left(xright) = 0 gives us the equation 3x^{2} + c = 0. The discriminant Delta of this quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac. For our equation, a = 3, b = 0, and c = c, so: [Delta = -12c > 0] This implies c < 0 for the discriminant to be positive, ensuring two real roots (critical points) exist. 4. The critical points are found by solving 3x^{2} + c = 0, yielding: [x = pmsqrt{-frac{c}{3}}] Let's denote these critical points as x_{4} = -sqrt{-frac{c}{3}} and x_{5} = sqrt{-frac{c}{3}}, where x_{4} is a local maximum and x_{5} is a local minimum. 5. For f(x) to have three zeros, it must be true that f(x_{4}) > 0 and f(x_{5}) < 0. Substituting x_{4} into f(x) gives: [f(x_{4}) = {(-sqrt{-frac{c}{3}})}^{3} + c(-sqrt{-frac{c}{3}}) + c > 0] Solving this inequality yields c < -frac{27}{4}. 6. Additionally, since f(x_{5}) < f(0) = c < 0, we confirm that c must be negative. Therefore, since b = 0 and c < -frac{27}{4}, the range of b - c is (frac{27}{4}, +infty).

A horizontal line through C intersects the curve at E(x_3, y_3). We are to find x_3 given x_1 = 1 and x_2 = 1000. 1. The y-coordinate of C is calculated based on the fact that C trisects overline{AB}, thus dividing the line segment into three equal parts.

Let ( p^{alpha} ) divide ( (P(a_k) - a_k) ). - By properties of integer polynomials, for any integer ( s ): [ p^alpha mid left( P^{(s)}(a_k) - a_k right) ] - This implies [ a_k equiv a_{k+1} equiv a_{k+2} equiv ldots (bmod p^alpha) ] - Thus, ( a_k equiv a_{k+s} = t^{Nalpha varphi(p^alpha)} equiv 0 text{ or } 1 (bmod p^alpha) ). - Therefore, ( p^alpha mid a_k(a_k - 1) ). 5. **Inferring the Constraints:** - Due to the arbitrary choice of ( p ) and ( k ), we infer: [ (P(a_k) - a_k) mid a_k(a_k - 1) ] - If ( deg P geq 3 ), then for sufficiently large ( k ): [ |P(a_k) - a_k| > |a_k (a_k - 1)| ] - This leads to a contradiction, implying ( deg P = 2 ). 6. **Case for ( deg P = 2 ):** - Suppose ( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ). - Since ( P(x) ) can grow as large as required, ( a in mathbb{Z}^+ ). - As ( k to +infty ), [ frac{a_k (a_k - 1)}{P(a_k) - a_k} to frac{1}{a} ] - Hence, ( a = 1 ), and for sufficiently large ( k ), we have: [ P(a_k) - a_k = a_k (a_k - 1) ] - This simplifies to ( P(a_k) = a_k^2 ) and thus ( P(x) = x^2 ). 7. **Conclusion and Checking:** - Given ( a_k = n^2 ), ( n neq t^b ), which does not satisfy the conditions. - Therefore, the form ( P(x) = ax + b ) must be linear.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Identify Right Triangles:** Since ( angle LMN + angle LNM = 90^circ ) and ( angle KMN + angle KNM = 90^circ ), triangles ( LMN ) and ( KMN ) are right triangles with the hypotenuse ( MN ). 2. **Calculate the Radius of the Circumscribing Sphere:** Let ( O ) be the midpoint of ( MN ).

The roots of the corresponding quadratic equation x^2-(2m+1)x+m^2+m = 0 are x=m and x=m+1. Since the inequality is strictly less than zero, x must lie between the roots.

Recall that the interior angles of a convex pentagon sum up to 3 times 180^circ = 540^circ. In a regular pentagon, all angles are equal, so each interior angle is: [ text{Interior angle} = frac{540^circ}{5} = 108^circ ] 2. Since the pentagon can be inscribed in a circle, each side of the pentagon subtends an arc of 72^circ (because 360^circ / 5 = 72^circ) and each diagonal subtends an arc of 144^circ (because 2 times 72^circ = 144^circ). Now consider the angles at the point F where the diagonals intersect. 3. Each side of the regular pentagon can be viewed as a chord in the circumscribed circle. Hence, diagonals in the pentagon are also chords and they intersect in such a way that the resulting segments create isosceles triangles. We calculate the angle at F based on the intercepted arcs: [ angle BAF = frac{1}{2} times angle BAC = frac{1}{2} times 72^circ = 36^circ ] [ angle ABF = frac{1}{2} times left( text{arc } ADB - text{arc } AB right) = frac{1}{2} times (144^circ - 72^circ) = 36^circ ] 4.

Consider the isosceles triangle BCF where F lies on AC: [ angle BFC = 2 times 36^circ = 72^circ quad text{and} quad angle FBC = angle BCF = 36^circ ] Therefore, BF = FC.

Now, we can write the equations as: 1) 380 = C + G 2) 420 = C + G + 0.05C Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2, we get: 420 - 380 = C + G + 0.05C - (C + G) 40 = 0.05C Now, we can solve for C: C = 40 / 0.05 C = 800 So, the cost of the article is Rs. boxed{800} ."},{"prompt":"The dimensions of a rectangular box in inches are all positive integers and the volume of the box is 2310 in^3.

So, we can write the equation as: 80 = (52/100) * M To find M, we can solve for it: M = 80 / (52/100) M = 80 * (100/52) M = 8000 / 52 M = 153.84615384615385 Since the maximum marks should be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number: M ≈ 154 Therefore, the maximum mark for paper I is approximately boxed{154} ."},{"prompt":"A number is divided into two parts such that the sum of 10 times the first and 22 times the second is 780.

According to the problem, the bigger part is 34, so we can assume ( y = 34 ) since it's the bigger part.

We can write this as an equation: [ 10x + 22y = 780 ] Since we know ( y = 34 ), we can substitute this value into the equation: [ 10x + 22(34) = 780 ] Now, let's solve for ( x ): [ 10x + 748 = 780 ] [ 10x = 780 - 748 ] [ 10x = 32 ] [ x = frac{32}{10} ] [ x = 3.2 ] So the first part of the number is 3.2.

This tells us that quadrilateral ( ABCD ) is a trapezoid with ( AD parallel BC ). 3. **Tangency Condition:** Moreover, the angle conditions imply that ( AB ) and ( CD ) are both tangent to the circumcircles of ( triangle PAD ) and ( triangle PBC ). This means ( AB = CD ), so ( ABCD ) is an isosceles trapezoid. 4. **Midpoints and Radical Axis:** Since the midpoints of ( AD ) and ( BC ) lie on the radical axis of the two circles, point ( P ) must be on the midline of the trapezoid. 5. **Reflection and Translation:** Reflect ( triangle PAB ) over the midline and translate it so that ( D ) maps to ( B' ) and ( C ) maps to ( A' ).

Now, we multiply 833 by 12 to get the largest 4-digit number divisible by 12. 833 * 12 = 9996 So, the largest 4-digit number exactly divisible by 12 is boxed{9996} ."},{"prompt":"Josie and her family went on a safari and had an exciting time watching different animals grazing and playing together.

When they work together for 1 hour, they complete 1/3 + 1/T of the wall. After Avery leaves, Tom works alone for 39.99999999999999 minutes, which is approximately 40 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 40 minutes is 40/60 or 2/3 of an hour. In that 2/3 of an hour, Tom completes the rest of the wall. His rate of work is 1/T of the wall per hour, so in 2/3 of an hour, he completes (2/3)*(1/T) of the wall. Since the wall is completed after Tom works alone for 2/3 of an hour, the work done by Avery and Tom together for 1 hour plus the work done by Tom alone for 2/3 of an hour equals 1 whole wall: 1/3 + 1/T + (2/3)*(1/T) = 1 To find the common denominator and combine the fractions, we multiply the first fraction by T/T and the third fraction by T/T: (T/3T) + (1/T) + (2/3)*(T/T) = 1 Now we combine the fractions: (T + 3 + 2) / 3T = 1 (T + 5) / 3T = 1 To solve for T, we multiply both sides by 3T: T + 5 = 3T Subtract T from both sides: 5 = 2T Divide both sides by 2: T = 5/2 T = 2.5 hours So, it takes Tom boxed{2.5} hours to build the wall by himself."},{"prompt":"bullet train 160 m long is running with a speed of 70 kmph . in what time will it pass a man who is running at 8 kmph in the direction opposite to that in which the bullet train is going ?","completion":"To calculate the time it takes for the bullet train to pass the man, we need to determine the relative speed between the two. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds together. The speed of the bullet train is 70 km/h, and the speed of the man is 8 km/h. So, the relative speed is: 70 km/h + 8 km/h = 78 km/h Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second (m/s) because the length of the train is given in meters. We use the conversion factor that 1 km/h is equal to 5/18 m/s. 78 km/h * (5/18) = 21.67 m/s (approximately) Now we have the relative speed in m/s. The next step is to calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the man. The time can be calculated using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance to be covered is the length of the train, which is 160 meters.

Triangle ABC: - All sides are equal (3 units), so it is equilateral. - The area of an equilateral triangle with side length s is given by the formula frac{sqrt{3}}{4}s^2. - Thus, the area of triangle ABC is frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 3^2 = frac{9sqrt{3}}{4}. 2. Trapezoid BCDE: - Since angle B = 110^circ and BC = 3, CD = DE = 5, calculate the height of the trapezoid using the sine rule in triangle BCD (assuming it is isosceles at C): - Height h = BC times sin(35^circ) (since 110^circ split in an isosceles triangle gives two angles of 35^circ). - The area of a trapezoid is frac{1}{2} times (a + b) times h, where a and b are the lengths of the parallel sides. - Here, BC = 3, and DE = 5, hence the area of trapezoid BCDE is frac{1}{2} times (3 + 5) times 3 sin(35^circ) = 4 times 3 sin(35^circ). 3. Total area of pentagon ABCDE is the sum of the areas of triangle ABC and trapezoid BCDE: - Total area = frac{9sqrt{3}}{4} + 12 sin(35^circ). - Numerically, sin(35^circ) approx 0.5736, so the area of the trapezoid approximates to 12 times 0.5736 approx 6.8832. - Therefore, the total area of ABCDE approx frac{9sqrt{3}}{4} + 6.8832.

This means that the taxes are correctly accounted for, and we don't need to solve for ( T ) since we are interested in the percentage spent on food.

For part (i), the probability of getting one specific question correct and the remaining (i-1) questions wrong is: [ left( frac{i}{i+1} right)^{i-1} cdot frac{1}{i+1} ] Since there are (i) questions in part (i), there are (i) ways to choose which question is correct. Thus, the probability for part (i) is: [ i cdot left( frac{i}{i+1} right)^{i-1} cdot frac{1}{i+1} = left( frac{i}{i+1} right)^i ] This is the same as the probability of getting all questions wrong in part (i). Therefore, the total probability of getting exactly one question correct in any of the (k) parts is: [ P(text{exactly one question correct}) = k cdot prod_{i=1}^k left( frac{i}{i+1} right)^i ] 3. **Set up the given condition:** According to the problem, the probability of getting exactly one question correct is 2018 times the probability of getting no questions correct: [ k cdot prod_{i=1}^k left( frac{i}{i+1} right)^i = 2018 cdot prod_{i=1}^k left( frac{i}{i+1} right)^i ] Simplifying, we get: [ k = 2018 ] 4. **Calculate the total number of questions on the exam:** The total number of questions is the sum of the number of questions in each part: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + dots + k = frac{k(k+1)}{2} ] Substituting (k = 2018): [ frac{2018 cdot 2019}{2} = 2037171 ] The final answer is (boxed{2037171})."},{"prompt":"Lateral sidelines AB and CD of a trapezoid ABCD ( AD >BC ) meet at point P .

Is this statement true if the sides of the polygons ( L_{1} ) and ( L_{2} ) are not pairwise parallel and equally directed? The length of a convex curve is defined as the limit of the perimeters of polygons circumscribed around it, with all external angles tending to zero (or as the limit of the perimeters of polygons inscribed in it, with side lengths tending to zero). The problem asserts that the sum of polygons with respectively parallel sides circumscribed around the curves ( K_{1} ) and ( K_{2} ) is a polygon with the same directions of sides circumscribed around ( K_{1} + K_{2} ). By problem 43, the perimeter of this polygon equals the sum of the perimeters of the polygons circumscribed around ( K_{1} ) and ( K_{2} ). Considering circumscribed polygons with increasingly smaller external angles and taking the limit, we see that the length of the curve ( K_{1} + K_{2} ) equals the sum of the lengths of the curves ( K_{1} ) and ( K_{2} ). In particular, the length of the curve ( K + O_{r} ), where ( O_{r} ) is a circle with radius ( r ), and ( K ) is a convex curve of length ( L ), is equal to ( L + 2 pi r ); this special case of our theorem was already obtained previously (see problem 42 and the related text).","completion":"1. **Introduction and Setup**: Let ( P_{1}Q_{1} ) and ( P_{2}Q_{2} ) be parallel and equally oriented sides of the polygons ( L_{1} ) and ( L_{2} ), respectively. Let ( A_{1} ) and ( A_{2} ) be the points of tangency of these polygons with the convex curves ( K_{1} ) and ( K_{2} ), respectively (as illustrated in Figure 188). Consider the definition of the sum of convex curves provided in Problem 41. According to this definition, the side ( PQ ) of the polygon ( L_{1} + L_{2} ), which is parallel to the lines ( P_{1} Q_{1} ) and ( P_{2} Q_{2} ) (refer to Problem 43), will pass through the point ( A_{1} + A_{2} ). Thus, it will be a support line for the curve ( K_{1} + K_{2} ). 2. **Determining the Polygon ( L_{1} + L_{2} )**: The sides of the polygon ( L_{1} + L_{2} ) will be segments of the support lines of the sum of the curves ( K_{1} + K_{2} ). Additionally, since both ( L_{1} ) and ( L_{2} ) are convex polygons and their sum will also be a convex polygon (refer to Problem 38), ( L_{1} + L_{2} ) will contain the curve ( K_{1} + K_{2} ) inside it. 3. **Proof Conclusion**: Hence, it is concluded that ( L_{1} + L_{2} ) is a polygon circumscribed around the curve ( K_{1} + K_{2} ). However, if the polygons ( L_{1} ) and ( L_{2} ) are not composed of pairwise parallel and equally directed sides, the assertion of the problem becomes untrue. For example, if ( K_{1} ) and ( K_{2} ) are equal circles, while ( L_{1} ) and ( L_{2} ) are equilateral triangles circumscribed around these circles but with non-equally oriented sides, then the curve ( K_{1} + K_{2} ) will be a circle, but ( L_{1} + L_{2} ) will be a hexagon, which is not circumscribed around the circle ( K_{1} + K_{2} ) (as illustrated in Figure 189).

Finally, he takes a 45-degree turn towards the southwest and goes 5 km. Let's break down the southwest movement into its south and west components using trigonometry.

The west component of the 5 km southwest movement is 5 * sin(45°) = 5 * (√2/2) = 5√2/2 km. Now, let's calculate the total distance covered in the north-south direction and the east-west direction.

We inscribe spheres within the first three cones with centers at O_1, O_2, O_3, respectively. These spheres are externally tangent to each other. 3. The tangents from the point A to all the spheres are equal, as any pair of spheres have a common tangent. 4. Let the fourth cone be inscribed in a manner that it touches these spheres at points B, C, D. Hence, AB = AC = AD meaning that these points B, C, and D lie on a sphere with center O that is inscribed in the fourth cone. 5. This sphere touches the other spheres at points B, C, and D. Thus the points O_1, O_2, O_3 lie on the segments OB, OC, OD respectively. 6. Observe that AO is the axis of symmetry for the fourth cone.

Therefore, the degree of ( n(x) ) is at most the degree of ( m(x) ): [ deg(n) leq deg(m) ] 6. **Degree of ( m(x) )**: The polynomial ( m(x) ) is a combination of ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ), so its degree is the maximum of the degrees of ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ): [ deg(m) = max(deg(f), deg(g)) ] 7. **Conclusion**: Combining these inequalities, we get: [ n-1 leq deg(n) leq deg(m) = max(deg(f), deg(g)) ] Therefore, at least one of ( f(x) ) or ( g(x) ) must have a degree greater than or equal to ( n-1 ).

We'll call a bag good if the number of one of its barrels is equal to the product of the numbers of the remaining barrels in the same bag (for example, the bag 2,3,6 is good, while 4,5,10 is not). What is the maximum possible number of good bags?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a set of 90 barrels, each numbered from 1 to 90, and the barrels are distributed among several bags. A bag is defined as \\"good\\" if the number of one barrel equals the product of the numbers of the other barrels in that same bag. 2. **Estimation of Minimum Numbers:** Each good bag must contain at least three barrels. This is because if we had only two barrels in a bag, say with numbers (a) and (b), the only way for one of the numbers to be the product of the other is if (a = b) or (b = a). Since each barrel has a unique number from 1 to 90, this is not possible. 3. **Smallest Number in the Bag:** For the sake of explanation, if a bag had any barrel with a number 10 or higher, then the product of the other numbers would also be at least 10, making the smallest possible number in the bag greater than or equal to (10 times 11 = 110). This contradicts the fact that barrel numbers range from 1 to 90. 4. **Implication on Number Distribution:** Based on the above logic, at least one of the numbers in each good bag must be a single-digit number (1-9). Additionally, for a bag to be a good one, it is required that the other numbers in the bag be such that their product is within the range 1 to 90. 5. **Counting Single-digit Numbers:** Since there are only 9 possible single-digit numbers (1 through 9), and given that each good bag must include at least one single-digit number, it limits the maximum number of good bags to 9. 6. **Forming Good Bags:** We can consider specific groupings to achieve the configuration such that each good bag has three numbers where one number is equal to the product of the others. The given example includes: (2,17,34), (3,16,48), (4,15,60), (5,14,70), (6,13,78), (7,12,84), (8,11,88), (9,10,90) Each of these sets forms a good bag because one of the numbers in each set is the product of the other two numbers. 7. **Conclusion:** Since no configuration allows for more than 9 good bags without violating the conditions set by the problem, and we have illustrated 8 valid arrangements, the maximum number of good bags is indeed 8.

Each head results in a step east, and each tail results in a step north. 2. **Determine the total number of steps**: The particle reaches (n, n) after taking exactly n steps east and n steps north, combining to 2n steps. However, we need to account for extra tosses, resulting in 2n + k tosses in total. 3. **Analyzing the paths**: To reach (n, n) in exactly 2n + k tosses, we need to include k additional steps which do not bring the particle closer to the destination. Thus, we consider the probability that after 2n + k tosses, those k tosses do not contribute to reaching (n, n) directly. 4. **Identify critical points**: - To reach (n, n) via 2n + k steps, the particle either: - Reaches (n, n + k): This means n heads and n + k tails. - Reaches (n + k, n): This means n + k heads and n tails. We denote these points as ( E_1(n, n+k) ) and ( E_2(n+k, n) ). 5. **Probability paths**: - Probability via ( E_1(n, n+k) ): - Total heads needed: n - Total tails needed: n+k - Binomial coefficient for choosing n heads out of 2n+k-1 steps: ( binom{2n+k-1}{n-1} ) - Probability via ( E_2(n+k, n) ): - Total heads needed: n+k - Total tails needed: n - Binomial coefficient for choosing n tails out of 2n+k-1 steps: ( binom{2n+k-1}{n-1} ) 6. **Calculate combined probability**: Both paths must not pass through intermediate points (n, n+k-1) or (n+k-1, n): Therefore, the probability ( p ) is the sum of probabilities: [ p = binom{2n+k-1}{n-1} cdot 2^{-2n-k} + binom{2n+k-1}{n-1} cdot 2^{-2n-k} ] Simplifying, [ p = left( 2 cdot binom{2n+k-1}{n-1} cdot 2^{-2n-k} right) ] Further simplifies to, [ p = binom{2n+k-1}{n-1} cdot 2^{-2n-k+1} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{ binom{2n+k-1}{n-1} cdot 2^{-2n-k+1} } ]"},{"prompt":"Let n be an positive integer.

Consider the case where ( d = 2n-1 ) and ( a_i = frac{n}{2n-1} ) for all ( 1 leq i leq 2n-1 ). [ sum_{i=1}^{2n-1} a_i = (2n-1) cdot frac{n}{2n-1} = n ] Since ( 0 leq frac{n}{2n-1} leq 1 ), the conditions ( a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_d = n ) and ( 0 leq a_i leq 1 ) are satisfied. If we can partition these numbers into ( k ) groups such that the sum of the numbers in each group is at most 1, then since ( frac{2n}{2n-1} > 1 ), each group can contain at most one ( a_i ). Therefore, there must be at least ( 2n-1 ) groups. Hence, ( k geq 2n-1 ). 2. **Showing that ( k = 2n-1 ) works:** Consider any sequence ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_d) ) such that ( a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_d = n ) and ( 0 leq a_i leq 1 ). If there exist two terms ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) (with distinct indices) such that ( a_i + a_j leq 1 ), we can replace these two terms with their sum and repeat the process. This operation reduces the number of terms by 1 each time. We continue this process until no two terms with distinct indices sum to a number at most 1. At this point, any two terms with distinct indices have a sum greater than 1. Let the resulting sequence be ( (b_1, b_2, ldots, b_d) ). 3. **Bounding ( d ):** Since no two terms ( b_i ) and ( b_j ) (with distinct indices) sum to a number at most 1, at least ( d-1 ) of the ( b_i ) must be greater than 0.5. Therefore, [ n = b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_d > 0.5(d-1) ] This implies: [ 2n > d - 1 implies d < 2n + 1 implies d leq 2n ] To show that ( d neq 2n ), assume ( d = 2n ). Then, [ b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_{2n} = n ] Since at least ( 2n-1 ) of the ( b_i ) are greater than 0.5, there must be exactly one ( b_i leq 0.5 ). Without loss of generality, let ( b_{2n} leq 0.5 ). Then, [ b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{2n-1} > 0.5 ] Let ( b_i = 0.5 + epsilon_i ) for ( 1 leq i leq 2n-1 ) where ( epsilon_i > 0 ). Then, [ b_{2n} = n - (0.5 + epsilon_1) - (0.5 + epsilon_2) - cdots - (0.5 + epsilon_{2n-1}) = 0.5 - (epsilon_1 + epsilon_2 + cdots + epsilon_{2n-1}) ] However, [ b_1 + b_{2n} = 1 - (epsilon_2 + cdots + epsilon_{2n-1}) leq 1 ] This contradicts the assumption that no two terms with distinct indices sum to a number at most 1. Therefore, ( d neq 2n ), and thus ( d leq 2n-1 ). 4. **Conclusion:** Since ( d leq 2n-1 ), we can partition the sequence into ( 2n-1 ) groups, each with a sum of at most 1.

This creates a new edge for each cut at each vertex, hence two new edges for each original edge (as each edge connects two vertices). 2. **Step 2: Additional Complexity with Additional Edges:** - Besides the cuts on the edges, each face incident on V_k adds one additional edge per plane cut. If f_k is the number of faces meeting at V_k, each face effectively adds an additional edge to the structure of R when the polyhedron is cut by P_k. 3. **Step 3: Counting Total Edges in R:** - Initially, each of the 150 original edges generates 2 new edges, resulting in 150 times 2 = 300 edges. - Additionally, each face associated with vertex V_k that adds an extra edge has to be considered. If f_k edges are added per vertex and assuming the average face count per vertex as a factor m (hypothetical mean), then an additional n times m edges are created. - Total new edges in R are 300 + nm. 4. **Step 4: Final Edge Count in R:** - With the original and the newly added edge count, the total number of edges in R is 300 + nm. Conclusion: If n is the number of vertices and m is the average number of faces meeting at any vertex V_k, then R has 300 + nm edges. This shows that the new problem setup is successfully capable of extending the complexity of the original problem dynamically based on n and m.

(2) Any subset ( S ) formed by the 2006 positive integers must contain a Sidon subset with at least 669 elements. (1) **Proof of the First Statement** 1. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a Sidon subset of ({1, 2, ldots, 2006}) with 1004 elements, denoted as ({a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{1004}}) where (1 leq a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_{1004} leq 2006). 2.

By the Sidon property, ( a_i + a_j neq a_k ) for distinct indices ( i, j, k ). 5. This implies that ( {a_i} ) and ( {b_j} ) must be mutually exclusive. 6. Hence, the numbers ( {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{1004}, b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{1003}} ) must all be distinct. 7. This contradicts the fact that there are only 2006 integers available, but we would need 2007 distinct integers. 8. Therefore, any Sidon subset of ({1, 2, ldots, 2006}) can have at most 1003 elements. Thus, (1) is proven. (2) **Proof of the Second Statement** 1. Let ( S = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2006}} ) be a set of 2006 positive integers. 2. There are infinitely many primes of the form (3k + 2). Let ( p = 3k + 2 ) be a prime larger than any element in ( S ) (by the infinite prime theorem). 3. Define ( x_{ij} equiv i cdot a_j (text{mod} p) ) for (1 leq i leq p-1) and (1 leq j leq 2006). - Note that (1 leq x_{ij} leq p-1). - For a fixed ( j ), since ((a_j, p) = 1), ({x_{1j}, x_{2j}, ldots, x_{(p-1)j}} = {1, 2, ldots, p-1}). 4. Consequently, among (sum_{i=1}^{p-1} x_{ij}), (2006(k+1)) of them belong to ( R = {k+1, k+2, ldots, 2k+1}). 5. Therefore, there exists an (i in {1, 2, ldots, p-1}) such that the (x_{i1}, x_{i2}, ldots, x_{i2006}) contains at least ( leftlfloor frac{2006(k+1)}{3k+1} rightrfloor geq 669 ) elements in ( R ). - If we choose (T = {a_j mid x_{ij} (text{mod} p) in R}), then (|T| geq 669). 6. Finally, we need to confirm that ( T ) is Sidon: - For any ( u, v in T ), ( x_{iu}, x_{iv} in R ). Consider ( x_{i(u+v)} equiv i cdot (u + v) (text{mod} p) ). - Since ( R ) is disjoint from ({0, 1, ldots, k} cup {2k+2, ldots, 3k+1}), we get ( u + v notin T ). Hence the set (T) is a Sidon set with at least 669 elements. Thus, (2) is proven.

If the statement on the silver box is false, this matches our assumption that P is true, and Q also reflects this truth. Next, let us assume P is false: 1.

If Q is false, then the silver box was not made by a member of the Cellini family; hence, logically, it must be made by Bellini. 3. Since P is false, it implies that both boxes are either both made by Bellini or both made by Cellini. Given Q is false (implying one of them), both must have been made by Bellini. 4. Consequently, the statement on the silver box is false, because it says that \\"the golden box was made by a member of Cellini family,\\" contradicting our scenario where both boxes were made by Bellini.

If the 100th digit is 4, then the repeating digit must be 4, and the quotient must be of the form 0.4444... (repeating). To achieve this, n must be a number that divides 864 to give a quotient of 0.4444... (repeating). The decimal 0.4444... can be expressed as a fraction 4/9. Therefore, we need to find a value of n such that: 864 / n = 4/9 Cross-multiplying gives us: 9 * 864 = 4n Now, let's calculate 9 * 864: 9 * 864 = 7776 So we have: 7776 = 4n Dividing both sides by 4 gives us: n = 7776 / 4 n = 1944 Therefore, if n = boxed{1944,} the quotient of 864 / n will have a repeating decimal with the digit 4, and the 100th digit will be 4."},{"prompt":"early April 2018, three national cultural celebrities, A, B, and C, visited our city to attend the Baoji Development Conference.

It turned out that each guest ate either twice as many raisins or 6 fewer raisins than their neighbor to the right. Prove that not all of the raisins were eaten.","completion":"1. **Introduction to the Problem:** Identify the given conditions and the requirement to prove. - Guests around a circular table were eating raisins from a basket with 2011 raisins. - Each guest either ate twice as many or 6 less raisins compared to their neighbor on the right. - We are asked to prove that not all raisins were eaten. 2. **Setting up the Problem:** Let's denote the number of raisins eaten by each guest as (a_i), where (i) ranges from 1 to (n) (the total number of guests). According to the problem, the number of raisins can be represented as follows: - (a_i = 2a_{i+1}) or (a_i = a_{i+1} - 6), where (1 leq i leq n) and indices are taken modulo (n) (i.e., (a_{n+1} = a_1)). 3. **Identifying Parity Properties:** Notice that if a guest ate twice as many raisins as their right neighbor, (a_i = 2a_{i+1}), then clearly (a_{i+1}) is even since doubling any integer yields another integer. - If (a_i = a_{i+1} - 6), then (a_{i+1} = a_i + 6). Therefore, (a_{i+1}) has the same parity (even or oddness) as (a_i). 4. **Determining Parity of Raisins:** Let's focus on the parity (evenness or oddness) of the numbers involved. - Identify the guest who ate the minimum number of raisins, say (a_{text{min}}). Assume (a_{text{min}} = k). - The neighbor on the right, who ate either (2k) or (k - 6). Both transformations (multiplying by 2, or subtracting 6) maintain evenness or oddness. 5. **Tracing Through All Guests:** - Continue passing around the table using the given conditions. - Either (a_i = 2a_{i+1}) (making any even (a_{i+1}) to even (a_i) or odd (a_{i+1}) to even (a_i)), or (a_i = a_{i+1} - 6) (preserving the even or odd property between (a_i) and (a_{i+1})). 6. **Concluding Uniform Parity:** - All guests must have eaten a number of raisins with the same parity as the smallest number of raisins eaten by any guest, implying if the smallest was even, all would be even, and the total consumption would be even. 7. **Checking Total Consumption Against 2011:** - The total number of raisins is 2011. - If all eaten numbers are even (or total of all even numbers), it contradicts that 2011 (an odd number) could be fully divided among this assumption. 8. **Conclusion:** - Since the total eaten as all even numbers cannot sum to 2011 (an odd number), it supports the fact that not all raisins were consumed.

If ( A' = E A ) is a row-reduced form of ( A ) with ( E ) a product of elementary matrices, then ( det E = 1 ) and ( E ) has integer entries. Hence, it suffices to prove the problem for upper triangular matrices. 4. **Induction on ( n )**: - Suppose ( A ) is an upper triangular matrix with integer entries and ( det A = bc ).

Write ( Y = [y_1, ldots, y_{n-1}] ) and ( Z = [z_1, ldots, z_{n-1}] ) and ( X = [x_1, ldots, x_{n-1}] ). 9. **Solving for ( Y ) and ( Z )**: - Matching the first coordinate, we have ( b_2 z_1 + y_1 C'_{1,1} = x_1 ). There exists an integer solution ( (y_1, z_1) ) because ( gcd(b_2, C'_{1,1}) mid gcd(b_2, det(C')) = gcd(b_2, c_1) = 1 ). - Matching the second coordinate, we have ( b_2 z_2 + y_1 C'_{1,2} + y_2 C'_{2,2} = x_2 ), which becomes ( b_2 z_2 + y_2 C'_{2,2} = x_2 - y_1 C'_{1,2} ). This admits a solution ( (y_2, z_2) ) for the same reason as above. - Continue in this manner to determine ( Y ) and ( Z ) satisfying the relation. The key is that ( b_2 ) is relatively prime to ( c_1 = det C' ) and thus to all the diagonal entries of ( C' ).

Considering that (angle ACB = 90^circ), it follows that (angle DCE < 90^circ). This observation is based on the geometric properties of a semicircle where (AC) and (BC) are radii and thus (AC perp BC). 2. **Hypothesis**: By illustrating the situation where point (P) is at the midpoint (O) of (AB), we observe that (angle DCE = 45^circ). We will proceed to prove that (angle DCE = 45^circ) for any arbitrary point (P) on segment (AB). 3. **Assumption and Variables**: Without loss of generality (w.l.o.g.), let the radius of the semicircle (h) be 1.

(2) For f(x) to be a monotonic function, the equation f'(x) = 0 must not have any roots in the interval x in [-4, 6]. The derivative f'(x) is f'(x) = 2x + 2a. Setting f'(x) = 0, we get 2x + 2a = 0 Rightarrow x = -a. For f(x) to be monotonic, -a must be either to the left of x = -4 or to the right of x = 6. Therefore, we have two cases: Case 1: -a > 6 Rightarrow a < -6, Case 2: -a < -4 Rightarrow a > 4. Hence, the values of a for which f(x) is monotonic are in the ranges: a < -6 or a > 4, which can be expressed as boxed{a in (-infty, -6) cup (4, infty)}."},{"prompt":"There are 9 cards with the same back, and different natural numbers from 1 to 9 are written on the front of each card.

This gives us a total of 5 odd numbers. The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes. In this case, the probability of drawing a card with an odd number is the number of odd-numbered cards (5) divided by the total number of cards (9).

This can be written as: (x^2 - y^2) = 16(x - y) (2) We can simplify equation (2) by factoring the left side as a difference of squares: (x + y)(x - y) = 16(x - y) Since x + y = 16 (from equation 1), we can substitute 16 in place of (x + y): 16(x - y) = 16(x - y) We can divide both sides by (x - y), assuming x ≠ y, to get: 16 = 16 This doesn't give us new information, so we need to find another way to solve this.

Since 10^2 equiv 1 pmod{11} and 10^6 equiv 1 pmod{13}, the least common multiple of 2 and 6 is 6. Therefore, j-i must be a multiple of 6. To find the valid pairs ((i, j)): - If j - i = 6, possible pairs are ((i, i+6)) where (i = 0) to (93), giving (94) solutions. - If j - i = 12, possible pairs are ((i, i+12)) where (i = 0) to (87), giving (88) solutions. - Continue similarly up to (j - i = 96), which gives (4) solutions. Summing all solutions: (94 + 88 + 82 + ldots + 4). This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 94, common difference -6, and last term 4. The number of terms (n) is given by the equation (94 - 6(n-1) = 4), solving gives (n = 16).

This indicates that these points are symmetric with respect to the axis of symmetry of the parabola. The axis of symmetry can be found using the formula x = frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, where x_1 and x_2 are the x-coordinates of the points that have the same y value. Therefore, the axis of symmetry is: [ x = frac{1 + (-5)}{2} = frac{-4}{2} = -2 ] 2. **Finding the Roots of the Parabola:** The table shows that when x=2, y=0. This means x=2 is a root of the parabola. Since the parabola is symmetric about x=-2, and we have a root at x=2, the distance from the axis of symmetry to the root is 2 - (-2) = 4 units.

Given the constraint ( |PQ| < 1 ), we should find a disk of radius ( frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ) that can contain these three points. 3. **Creating an equilateral triangle:** Without loss of generality, assume ( PQ ) is the longest side of the triangle ( triangle PQR ). Construct an equilateral triangle ( PQS ) on the same side of ( PQ ) as point ( R ). 4. **Bounding circle:** The radius of the circumcircle (bounding circle) of the equilateral triangle ( PQS ) is: [ text{Radius of circumcircle of } triangle PQS = frac{PQ}{sqrt{3}} < frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ] 5. **Position of ( R ):** Since ( R ) is within the triangle ( triangle PQR ) and ( PQS ) is equilateral bounded by the circle through points ( P, Q, ) and ( S ): [ R text{ must lie inside the bounding circle of triangle } PQS ] 6. **Three circles intersection:** Using a different perspective, construct three circles each with a radius ( frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ) centered at ( P, Q, ) and ( R ).

This inversion maps ( P ) to ( P' ) and ( Q ) to ( Q' ). 3. **Mapping of line ( BC )**: The inversion ( mathcal{I}(H, k) ) maps the line ( BC ) to the circumcircle of ( triangle AEF ). Therefore, ( P' ) and ( Q' ) both lie on the circumcircle of ( triangle AEF ). 4. **Orthocenter properties**: Since ( H ) is the orthocenter of ( triangle ABC ), it will also be the orthocenter of ( triangle AQP ). Thus, ( Q' ) and ( P' ) are the projections of ( P ) and ( Q ) onto ( AQ ) and ( AP ), respectively. 5. **Radical axis**: The line ( AF ) is the radical axis of the two circles passing through ( A ) and ( F ) and tangent to ( BC ) at ( P ) and ( Q ), respectively.

Consider the neighbors ( b, c, ) and ( d ) of ( a ). 10. **Edge Coloring**: - Remove vertex ( a ) and its incident edges. - The remaining graph ( G' ) of ( n-1 ) vertices meets the initial condition. - By induction or the same argument, color the edges of ( G' ) such that no single color forms a cycle. - We introduce vertex ( a ) back and consider coloring the edges ( (a, b), (a, c), ) and ( (a, d) ). 11. **No Cyclic Colors**: - Ensure edges ( (a, b) ) and ( (a, c) ) do not share a cycle. - Color these edges distinctly or adjust previous coloring if needed. - Ensure no cycle is formed by the same color for the edge ( (a, d) ). - This is feasible given that ( a ) had a degree of 3, not more edges to introduce new cycles. 12. **Contradiction and Conclusion**: - This shows that every vertex and its incident edges can be colored according to the condition, ensuring no cycle of the same color. - Thus, the graph ( G ) can indeed be edge colored by two different airlines (colors) such that no airline forms a closed path.

So, we have: [ overrightarrow{AB} = lambda overrightarrow{BD} ] 2. We need to find overrightarrow{BD}. Given that overrightarrow{BD} = overrightarrow{BC} + overrightarrow{CD}, we substitute the given vectors into this relationship: [ overrightarrow{BD} = (5overrightarrow{e_1} + 4overrightarrow{e_2}) + (-overrightarrow{e_1} - 2overrightarrow{e_2}) ] Simplifying, we get: [ overrightarrow{BD} = (5 - 1)overrightarrow{e_1} + (4 - 2)overrightarrow{e_2} = 4overrightarrow{e_1} + 2overrightarrow{e_2} ] 3.

Let's denote the equal sides as a and the base as b. The perimeter is given by P = 2a + b = 23. 2. **Determine the parity of the base**: Since the perimeter is odd (23) and the sum of the two equal sides (2a) is even (because any number multiplied by 2 is even), it follows that the base length b must be odd to make the total perimeter odd. 3. **Base length constraint**: For any triangle, the length of any side must be less than the sum of the other two sides. For an isosceles triangle, this means b < 2a. Given the perimeter is 23, we have 2a + b = 23, which implies b < 23 - b. Therefore, b must be less than half of 23, which is 11.5. Since b is an integer and must be odd, the possible values for b are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. 4. **Calculate the corresponding equal side lengths**: For each possible base length b, we can find the corresponding equal side lengths a using the perimeter formula 2a + b = 23. This gives us the pairs: - For b = 1, 2a + 1 = 23 Rightarrow 2a = 22 Rightarrow a = 11. The sides are (11, 11, 1). - For b = 3, 2a + 3 = 23 Rightarrow 2a = 20 Rightarrow a = 10.

The sides are (8, 8, 7). - For b = 9, 2a + 9 = 23 Rightarrow 2a = 14 Rightarrow a = 7. The sides are (7, 7, 9). - For b = 11, 2a + 11 = 23 Rightarrow 2a = 12 Rightarrow a = 6.

By definition, the inverse function satisfies f(f^{-1}(x)) = x. Hence, log_a(8 - 2(f^{-1}(x))) = x. Replacing f^{-1}(x) with its expression, we get log_a(8 - 2(log_2(8 - ax))) = x. For f(x) to be its own inverse, we must have f(f(x)) = x, which translates to log_a(8 - 2x) = log_2(8 - ax). By property of logarithms, the arguments must be equal when the bases are different, hence 8 - 2x = 8 - ax. Solving for a we get a = 2. (2) Since 8 - 2x > 0, we find that x < 4. Consequently, the domain of y = f(x) + f(-x) is (-4, 4). Let's simplify y: f(x) + f(-x) = log_a(8 - 2x) + log_a(8 + 2x). By property of logarithms, y = log_a((8 - 2x)(8 + 2x)) = log_a(64 - (2x)^2). Since 2x + 2(-x) = 0, the argument inside the logarithm becomes 64 - 4x^2. The expression reaches its minimum when x = 0, therefore min(64 - 4x^2) = 64 - 4(0)^2 = 64. When a > 1, the logarithm function is increasing meaning that the maximum value of y occurs when the argument is maximized. Since the argument reaches its maximum value when x = 0, the maximum of y is log_a(64) = log_a(2^6) = 6log_a(2).

The drug is known for its central nervous system stimulant effects. \\"Adderall\\" itself is a brand name, though the drug is also available in generic forms. While \\"Adderall\\" is the original and one of the most recognized brands, there are other brands and numerous generic versions available on the market. The popularity of specific brands can vary over time based on factors like availability, cost, insurance coverage, and prescribing habits of healthcare providers. However, some of the branded and generic versions available include: 1. **Adderall** (the original mixed amphetamine salts), 2. **Adderall XR** (an extended-release formulation of Adderall), 3. **Mydayis** (another extended-release formulation that contains the same active ingredients as Adderall and Adderall XR, but with a different release mechanism), 4. Generic versions, which are simply labeled as \\"Mixed Amphetamine Salts\\" or \\"Amphetamine Salt Combo\\", and vary by manufacturer. In the United States, generics are very popular due to their affordability and wide availability. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that generic drugs have the same active ingredient, strength, dosage form, and route of administration as the original brand name drug, ensuring their safety and efficacy. Insurance coverage and formulary listings can significantly influence which version a patient receives. Some insurance plans may prefer one brand over another or prefer a generic version to control costs. However, some patients and healthcare professionals report differences in the effectiveness or side effects between the brand-name medication and certain generics, leading to preferences for specific brands or formulations. It's also worth noting that due to its potential for abuse, Adderall is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance in the U.S., and its prescription is tightly regulated."},{"prompt":"is it true that human organism synthesize methamphetamine?","completion":"Yes, it is true, but the context and quantity are crucial to understand this correctly. Trace amounts of methamphetamine can indeed be synthesized in the human body from other substances. Research has shown that certain compounds present in the human body or ingested through diet, such as amphetamine (which itself can be produced in trace amounts by the human body), can undergo minor chemical transformations, leading to the formation of very small quantities of methamphetamine. One study, published in the \\"Journal of Clinical Chemistry\\" in 2011, found that selegiline, a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease and major depressive disorder, can be metabolized into methamphetamine and amphetamine. However, the quantities produced are extremely low and have no psychostimulant effects. It is also known that certain foods and herbal products can lead to the production of trace amounts of amphetamines within the body or can contain small amounts of these substances. For example, the consumption of ephedra-containing products can result in the presence of methamphetamine and amphetamine in urine tests. Ephedra is a plant that contains ephedrine, a compound that can be chemically converted to methamphetamine. However, the levels of methamphetamine produced naturally or through the metabolism of substances found in food or medications are significantly lower than those associated with drug abuse. These trace amounts are typically not sufficient to produce any of the psychoactive effects associated with recreational methamphetamine use and are generally not relevant from a clinical or forensic perspective, except in the context of highly sensitive drug testing where their presence might require interpretation."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, you haven't provided the text you want translated into Persian. Could you please share the text you need translated?"},{"prompt":"translate this to persian: More importantly, look what’s avoided. Dull exposition about character traits. Heavy-handed reminders about what’s important. Overt message statements from the author. None of which is dramatic in the least. Action is dramatic. A triumphant ride in a landau, a spirited chukker on the maidan, even a simple bicycle ride. They move. They show the character doing something. And in doing, he reveals elements of himself. That’s what novels do: they reveal. They’re not very good at explicating, at declaiming, or even at essaying. But they’re excellent at revealing. It was a poet, William Carlos Williams, who said, “No ideas but in things,” but he could just as well have been talking about novels. Here then, is the Law of People and Things: Characters are revealed not only by their actions and their words, but also by the items that surround them. This last element is often overlooked in creative writing texts, which advise the aspiring fictionist to eschew lengthy explanations of character in favor of revelation through actions and words. Sage advice, as far as it goes, but it needs to go a bit beyond. The things—the trinkets and baubles, the essentials and frills, the tools and toys—associated with a character typically reveal aspects of his personality as well as key ingredients of the story: plot, significance, idea, motif, theme. Okay, so how does that work? It’s a mystery. Seriously. Lots of theories posited but nothing decisive. I put it under the heading of deflection of meaning, by which I mean, broadly, the alchemical process by which a literal thing comes to stand in figuratively for some other thing. This bit of magic is the subject of my previous book, How to Read Literature Like a Professor, but this is almost the only time I’ll employ it here, and only because it is so critical to the business of creating character. T. S. Eliot, in his essay “Hamlet and His Problems” (1922) and elsewhere, gives us a more or less useful term, the “objective correlative,” by which he means the external set of objects that stand in for some internal emotion or condition. The objects provide the concrete, tangible images that allow readers or audiences to grasp the necessarily abstract inner workings of a character. Where Eliot goes wrong, to the extent that he does, is in insisting that the result of the objective correlative is to convey one and only one emotion, so that confusion is impossible. I believe that when very young, Eliot was badly frightened by a double meaning, hence his determination to exert absolute authorial control. Rather, the ambiguity is precisely what intrigues in the objective correlative or character emblem. We can forgive his excess as a product of his age; like so many of the so-called New Critics, he was also a writer, in his case a writer first who was also a critic, and so he and they naturally want to cede power in the writer-reader relationship to the writer, to put the author in authority. What anyone who came of critical age after about 1965 or so will note, however, is that the balance of power has shifted, that readers are the ultimate arbiters of meaning in a work. Besides, the work becomes so much livelier as a space of engagement when the possibilities are more open-ended, when ambiguity, indeterminacy, and irony are all in play. Consider Stephen’s “ashplant.” Joyce gives Stephen Dedalus a walking stick made of ashwood, an object he acquires first in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and carries through to Ulysses. He employs it sometimes in its designed role, as a cane carried by a young man, sometimes as a fashion accessory, sometimes as a mock sword or a punctuator for his rapier wit, sometimes as a weapon, as when he smashes the chandelier in Bella Cohen’s brothel during the hallucinatory Circe episode of the later novel. When he is beaten by the soldiers, Stephen has his ashplant, along with his hat, restored to him by Leopold Bloom. So then, class, what does Stephen’s ashplant stand for? Oh, it almost certainly has some Freudian possibilities as a phallic symbol, the more so given the character’s doubts about his manhood. And it is without question a crutch of sorts, at times. Is it a device for keeping the world at bay? Probably. Will other readers find other possible explanations and interpretations? Indubitably. Whatever Joyce may have intended, the matter, like the ashplant, is out of his hands. The moment the book was published on February 2, 1922, it ceased to be his and became ours. Thanks all the same, Jim, but further assistance is no longer required of the author; we’ll make the decisions from here on out. Writers can suggest meaning and significance, but ultimately, readers make the final call.","completion":"مهم‌تر از آن، ببینید چه چیزی اجتناب شده است. توضیحات خسته‌کننده در مورد ویژگی‌های شخصیت. یادآوری‌های سنگین دست در مورد چیزهای مهم. بیانیه‌های پیام آشکار از نویسنده. هیچکدام از این‌ها کمترین دراماتیک نیستند. عمل دراماتیک است. سواری پیروزمندانه در یک ارابه، یک دور اسب‌سواری پرشور در میدان، حتی یک سواری ساده دوچرخه. آن‌ها حرکت می‌کنند. آن‌ها نشان می‌دهند شخصیت در حال انجام کاری است. و در انجام دادن، او جنبه‌هایی از خودش را آشکار می‌کند. این است که رمان‌ها چه کاری انجام می‌دهند: آن‌ها آشکار می‌کنند. آن‌ها در تفسیر کردن، در اعلام کردن، یا حتی در انشا نویسی خیلی خوب نیستند. اما در آشکارسازی، عالی هستند. شاعری، ویلیام کارلوس ویلیامز، گفته بود، \\"هیچ ایده‌ای جز در چیزها نیست\\"، اما او می‌توانست به همان خوبی در مورد رمان‌ها صحبت کند. پس اینجاست، قانون مردم و چیزها: شخصیت‌ها نه تنها با اعمال و کلماتشان، بلکه همچنین با اشیایی که آنها را احاطه کرده‌اند، آشکار می‌شوند. این آخرین عنصر غالباً در متون نویسندگی خلاق نادیده گرفته می‌شود که به داستان‌نویس بلندپرواز توصیه می‌کند که از توضیحات طولانی در مورد شخصیت به نفع آشکارسازی از طریق اعمال و کلمات اجتناب کند. این یک مشورت خردمندانه است، تا جایی که پیش می‌رود، اما نیاز دارد که کمی فراتر برود. چیزها- جواهرات و زینت‌آلات، ضروریات و تزئینات، ابزارها و اسباب‌بازی‌ها- که با یک شخصیت در ارتباط هستند، معمولاً جنبه‌هایی از شخصیت او را همچنین عناصر کلیدی داستان: داستان، اهمیت، ایده، موتیف، تم را آشکار می‌کنند. خوب، پس چطور این کار می‌کند؟ این یک راز است. جدی. نظریه‌های زیادی مطرح شده اما هیچ چیز قطعی نیست. من آن را تحت عنوان انحراف معنی قرار می‌دهم، که منظورم، به طور گسترده، فرآیند کیمیاگری است که توسط آن یک چیز واقعی به نمادی استعاری برای چیز دیگری تبدیل می‌شود. این قطعه جادویی موضوع کتاب قبلی من است، چگونه مانند یک استاد ادبیات بخوانیم، اما این تقریبا تنها زمانی است که من آن را اینجا به کار می‌برم، و فقط به این دلیل که این موضوع برای کار ایجاد شخصیت بسیار حیاتی است. تی. اس. الیوت، در مقاله‌اش \\"هملت و مشکلاتش\\" (1922) و در جاهای دیگر، به ما یک اصطلاح تقریبا مفید، \\"معادل موضوعی\\" را می‌دهد، که بدان معناست مجموعه خارجی اشیاء که برای برخی احساسات یا شرایط داخلی جایگزین می‌شوند. اشیاء تصاویر ملموس و قابل لمسی را فراهم می‌کنند که به خوانندگان یا مخاطبان اجازه می‌دهند تا عملکردهای لزوماً انتزاعی درونی یک شخصیت را درک کنند. جایی که الیوت اشتباه می‌کند، به اندازه‌ای که می‌کند، در اصرار بر این است که نتیجه معادل موضوعی باید یک و تنها یک احساس را منتقل کند، به طوری که سردرگمی غیرممکن باشد. من باور دارم که وقتی خیلی جوان بود، الیوت توسط یک معنای دوگانه بدجوری ترسیده بود، از این رو تعیین او برای اعمال کنترل مطلق نویسنده. بلکه، ابهام دقیقاً چیزی است که در معادل موضوعی یا نشانگر شخصیت جذاب است. ما می‌توانیم افراط او را به عنوان محصول عصرش ببخشیم؛ مانند بسیاری از به اصطلاح منتقدان جدید، او نیز یک نویسنده بود، در مورد او یک نویسنده اول که همچنین یک منتقد بود، و بنابراین او و آن‌ها طبیعتاً می‌خواهند قدرت را در رابطه نویسنده-خواننده به نویسنده واگذار کنند، تا نویسنده را در مقام اقتدار قرار دهند. اما آنچه کسی که پس از حدود سال 1965 به سن انتقادی رسیده، توجه خواهد کرد، این است که توازن قدرت تغییر کرده است، که خوانندگان نهایتاً مرجع تعیین‌کننده معنی در یک اثر هستند. علاوه بر این، کار به مراتب جذاب‌تر به عنوان فضایی برای مشارکت می‌شود وقتی احتمالات بازتر هستند، وقتی ابهام، نامشخصی و آهنگربایی همگی در بازی هستند. به \\"اشپلانت\\" استفن فکر کنید. جویس به استفن ددالوس یک عصای پیاده‌روی ساخته شده از چوب خاکستر می‌دهد، یک شی‌ء که او ابتدا در \\"پرتره‌ای از هنرمند جوان\\" به دست می‌آورد و آن را به \\"اولیس\\" منتقل می‌کند. گاهی اوقات از آن به عنوان یک چوبدستی که توسط یک مرد جوان حمل می‌شود استفاده می‌کند، گاهی اوقات به عنوان یک اکسسوری مد، گاهی اوقات به عنوان یک شمشیر تقلبی یا یک علامت‌گذار برای ذکاوت تیز او، گاهی اوقات به عنوان یک سلاح، همانطور که وقتی او لوستر را در خانه فاحشه بلا کوهن در حین قسمت توهمی سیرس در رمان بعدی می‌شکند. وقتی توسط سربازان زده می‌شود، استفن اشپلانت خود را همراه با کلاهش، توسط لئوپولد بلوم بازپس می‌گیرد. پس، کلاس، اشپلانت استفن برای چه چیزی ایستاده است؟ اوه، قطعاً احتمالات فرویدی به عنوان یک نماد فالیک دارد، بیشتر از آن به خاطر شک‌های شخصیت در مورد مردانگی‌اش. و بدون شک نوعی عصای کمکی است، گاهی اوقات. آیا یک دستگاه برای نگه داشتن جهان در فاصله است؟ احتمالاً. آیا خوانندگان دیگر تفسیرها و تعبیرهای دیگری پیدا خواهند کرد؟ قطعاً. هر چه جویس ممکن است قصد داشته باشد، موضوع، مانند اشپلانت، دیگر در دستان او نیست. لحظه‌ای که کتاب در 2 فوریه 1922 منتشر شد، دیگر متعلق به او نبود و متعلق به ما شد. به هر حال ممنون، جیم، اما کمک بیشتری از طرف نویسنده دیگر لازم نیست؛ ما از این به بعد تصمیمات را خواهیم گرفت. نویسندگان می‌توانند معنا و اهمیت را پیشنهاد کنند، اما در نهایت، خوانندگان تصمیم نهایی را می‌گیرند."},{"prompt":"translate this to persian: And how are those calls made? Let’s go back to the case(s) of the flowers. At the start of this chapter, I mentioned two characters with emblematic flowers. There are lots more, of course, but two will suffice. First, Nero Wolfe. Wolfe has many character emblems, so many in fact that I sometimes think the emblems are a substitute for actual characterization. Perhaps this is generally true of fictional detectives; they’re almost always less fully developed than main characters in standard novels, yet they seem to have twice as many tics and signs hanging about them. Wolfe has his great size—a fifth of a ton, we’re told in more than one novel—as well as his personal chef, Fritz; his bottles of beer, always delivered to him already opened and waiting; his dislike of personal contact; his rare books; and his clothing, especially his invariably yellow shirts. You can do a good deal with any of them. In fact, I once heard the famous literary biographer Leon Edel hold forth for many minutes on the significance of a writer named Rex (Latin for king) Stout having a hero named Nero (as in the emperor), whose stature at four hundred pounds is well beyond stout. See the fun you can have with books? But the one emblem that best defines Wolfe is the orchid. He cultivates them in his rooftop greenhouse. Either they or the greenhouse itself figure into the plots of several of the novels and stories. They seem almost anomalous at first, being so delicate and small, so dainty set against his great girth. But both he and they are hothouse creatures. He almost never leaves the brownstone he calls home. Fresh air is anathema to him. Like them, he requires very precise and careful handling in order to bring out his genius. Moreover, they allow him to express his artistic side, to show a passion completely absent in every other area of his existence. When he is troubled or perplexed, he retreats to the greenhouse to commune with his orchids, nearly the only things in his world with which he is never angry. We could learn the things we know about Wolfe without orchids, but they offer a kind of shortcut to that knowledge, both revealing and reinforcing aspects of his character in ways both tangible and vivid. And what of Clarissa Dalloway? On a purely practical level, she needs flowers for her party that evening: what, after all, is a gathering without a bit of floral decoration? Flowers present lead to flowers past and memories of being a girl in flower many years earlier. The imagery is more troubled than with Wolfe’s orchids, however—perhaps to be expected of a more complex, layered narrative. Clarissa collects the flowers at the shop as promised, of course, and their reflection in a window catches the eye of the doomed, frantic ex-soldier Septimus Warren Smith when the car backfires in the street. He can’t be sure what the reflection is an image of—a tree perhaps, even the tree behind which his dead comrade Evans hides throughout the day—but he is sure the image is fraught with meaning especially for him. Or perhaps merely fraught. And there is a fitting image of the reader’s enterprise: an image that catches our eye, suggesting some secondary thing of whose meaning we can’t quite be certain and whose significance is vague at best. We are forced, like Septimus, to invent, to select for ourselves from a catalog of dim possibilities the one or two most likely or most comforting or perhaps least implausible.","completion":"چگونه این تماس‌ها برقرار می‌شوند؟ بیایید به مورد (های) گل‌ها بازگردیم. در ابتدای این فصل، من از دو شخصیت با گل‌های نمادین آنها نام بردم. البته گل‌های بسیار بیشتری هستند، اما دو مورد کافی است. اول، نرو ولف. ولف نمادهای شخصیتی بسیاری دارد، به قدری که گاهی فکر می‌کنم این نمادها جایگزینی برای شخصیت‌پردازی واقعی هستند. شاید این موضوع به طور کلی در مورد کاراگاه‌های داستانی صدق کند؛ آنها تقریباً همیشه کمتر از شخصیت‌های اصلی در رمان‌های استاندارد توسعه یافته‌اند، با این حال به نظر می‌آید دو برابر علائم و نشانه‌هایی دارند. ولف دارای جثه‌ای بزرگ است - یک پنجم تن، طوری که در بیش از یک رمان به ما گفته می‌شود - همچنین آشپز شخصی‌اش، فریتز؛ بطری‌های آبجویش، همیشه برایش باز شده و منتظر؛ تنفرش از تماس شخصی؛ کتاب‌های نایابش؛ و لباس‌هایش، به ویژه پیراهن‌های همیشه زردش. می‌توان با هر کدام از آنها کارهای زیادی کرد. در واقع، یک بار شنیدم که بیوگرافیست مشهور ادبی، لئون ادل، بسیاری دقایق را صرف بحث در مورد اهمیت یک نویسنده‌ای به نام رکس (لاتین برای پادشاه) استوت کرد که یک قهرمان به نام نرو (همچوز امپراطور) دارد، که قدش چهارصد پوند است و خیلی فراتر از \\"ستوت\\" است. ببینید با کتاب‌ها چه سرگرمی‌هایی می‌توان داشت؟ اما یک نماد که بهترین تعریف را از ولف ارائه می‌دهد، ارکیده است. او آنها را در گلخانه‌ی روی بامش پرورش می‌دهد. یا خود گلخانه در داستان‌ها و رمان‌های متعددی به ماجراها وارد می‌شود. آنها در نگاه اول تقریبا غیر عادی به نظر می‌رسند، چرا که بسیار ظریف و کوچک هستند، بسیار لطیف در برابر حجم بزرگ او. اما هم او و هم آنها موجودات گلخانه‌ای هستند. او تقریبا هرگز خانه‌ای را که خانه‌اش می‌نامد ترک نمی‌کند. هوای تازه برای او منفور است. همانند آنها، او نیاز به رسیدگی بسیار دقیق و مراقبتی دارد تا استعدادش بروز کند. علاوه بر این، ارکیده‌ها به او اجازه می‌دهند تا طرفداری هنری خود را بروز دهد، تا شوری را نشان دهد که در هر زمینه‌ی دیگری از وجودش کاملا غایب است. وقتی نگران یا متحیر است، به گلخانه پناه می‌برد تا با ارکیده‌هایش ارتباط برقرار کند، تقریبا تنها چیزهایی در دنیایش که هیچ‌گاه عصبانی نمی‌شود. ما می‌توانیم چیزهایی را که در مورد ولف می‌دانیم بدون ارکیده‌ها بدانیم، اما آنها راهی میان‌بر برای دستیابی به این دانش ارائه می‌دهند، جنبه‌هایی از شخصیت او را به روش‌هایی هم ملموس و هم زنده نشان داده و تقویت می‌کنند. و در مورد کلاریسا دلووی چطور؟ در سطح کاملا کاربردی، او برای مهمانی شبانه‌اش به گل نیاز دارد: بالاخره، یک دورهمی بدون کمی تزئین گلی چیست؟ گل‌های حاضر به گل‌های گذشته و خاطرات دختری در گل سال‌ها پیش منجر می‌شوند. تصویرپردازی دشوارتر از ارکیده‌های وُلف است، هرچند - شاید انتظار می‌رود از روایتی پیچیده‌تر و لایه‌لایه‌تر. کلاریسا همانطور که قول داده بود، گل‌ها را از فروشگاه جمع‌آوری می‌کند، البته، و بازتاب آنها در یک پنجره چشم سرباز سابق ناامید و عصبانی، سپتیموس وارن اسمیت، را هنگامی که ماشین در خیابان باز می‌شود، جلب می‌کند. او نمی‌تواند مطمئن باشد که بازتاب چیزی از تصویر چیست - شاید یک درخت، حتی درختی که همرزم مرده‌اش اوانز تمام روز پشت آن مخفی می‌ماند - اما او مطمئن است تصویر دارای معنایی خاص برای اوست. یا شاید فقط دارای معنا. و این یک تصویر مناسب از کسب و کار خواننده است: تصویری که چشم ما را به خود جلب می‌کند، چیزی ثانویه‌ای را پیشنهاد می‌کند که معنای آن را نمی‌توانیم کاملا مطمئن باشیم و اهمیت آن حداقل ابهامی است. ما مجبوریم، مانند سپتیموس، اختراع کنیم، برای خودمان از فهرستی از احتمالات مبهم، یک یا دو مورد بیشتر احتمالی یا دلگرم‌کننده یا شاید کمتر غیر محتمل را انتخاب کنیم."},{"prompt":"translate this to persian: The holder of those flowers is herself a fading bloom, brought low to earth in her own autumn by time and hardship (she now has a bad heart as a result of influenza during the epidemic of 1918). Yet she hearkens back to her own springtime, a season marked with flowers, and to other uses of them, particularly to Sally Seton’s arrangement of stemless flower heads floating in a bowl of water, a youthful statement that shocked their elders. Are those shocking flowers emblematic of an equally shocking attraction between the two girls, which found its expression in a single kiss Sally gave Clarissa? Is the brevity of floral life emblematic of the transient nature of Clarissa’s own or an ironic commentary on the permanence of relationships, since not only the memories of that long-ago time but the persons involved all reappear during Clarissa’s day and evening? Is the obvious sexual nature of flowers, which exist after all not for our pleasure but for propagation of the species, a reminder of human sexual nature as embodied by her blooming daughter, Elizabeth, or a commentary on the diminished (and always ambiguous) sexuality of Clarissa, who, past the age of childbearing, now sleeps alone in a “narrow bed”? Woolf isn’t telling. She offers, suggests, intimates, but never explains. As with the stocking Mrs. Ramsay knits in To the Lighthouse, of which the critic Erich Auerbach made so much in his famous chapter, “The Brown Stocking,” in Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature (1946), where he observed that there is no “authorized” or authorial reality in this modern novel, as there would have been in a traditional work. Instead, external objects and events stand as mere markers for moments in time and as occasions for the characters’ internal realities to assert themselves. Indeed, as with the lighthouse itself, or Mr. Ramsay’s peripatetic verse recitations, the brown stocking can and does mean many different things, changing from moment to moment and character to character. The same with Clarissa’s narrow bed, or Peter Walsh’s pocketknife, or Miss Kilman’s shabby mackintosh. So what to make of all those flowers? Woolf prudently leaves that to someone else. Any volunteers? This is why we readers get the big money. From the merest threads, from hints and allegations, we weave something we believe to be solid and permanent. We find reality in characters who never existed, find internal motivation and emotion from the things they carry, construct whole people from outlines and sketches. It is, in the language of book reviewers, a bravura performance. Maybe we deserve the royalty checks. Just, for safety’s sake, don’t hold your breath.","completion":"دارنده‌ی آن گل‌ها خود گلی است که رو به پژمردگی است، به خاک کشیده شده در پاییز خویش توسط زمان و سختی‌ها (اکنون او به دلیل آنفلوآنزا در طی همه‌گیری ۱۹۱۸ دچار بیماری قلبی شده است). با این حال، او به بهار خود بازمی‌گردد، فصلی که با گل‌ها نشانه‌گذاری شده و به کاربردهای دیگر آن‌ها، به طور خاص به چیدمان سالی سیتون از سرهای گل بی‌ساقه که در کاسه‌ای از آب شناور هستند، بیانگری جوانانه که بزرگترها را شوکه کرد. آیا آن گل‌های شوکه‌کننده نمادی از جاذبه‌ای به همان اندازه شوکه‌کننده بین دو دختر هستند، که بیان آن در بوسه‌ای تکی است که سالی به کلاریسا داد؟ آیا کوتاهی عمر گل‌ها نمادی از طبیعت گذرا در خود کلاریساست یا یک تمسخر آهنین بر دوام روابط است، چرا که نه تنها خاطرات آن دوران دوردست بلکه اشخاص درگیر همه در روز و شب کلاریسا دوباره ظاهر می‌شوند؟ آیا طبیعت جنسی آشکار گل‌ها، که در نهایت نه برای لذت ما بلکه برای تکثیر گونه وجود دارند، یادآور طبیعت جنسی انسان که توسط دختر شکوفای او، الیزابت، جسمی شده یا یک تمسخر بر جنسیت کاهش‌یافته (و همیشه مبهم) کلاریساست، که اکنون، که از سن باروری گذشته، تنها در یک «تخت باریک» می‌خوابد؟ وولف نمی‌گوید. او پیشنهاد می‌کند، اشاره می‌کند، نوازش می‌کند، اما هرگز توضیح نمی‌دهد. همانطور که با جورابی که خانم رمزی در To the Lighthouse بافت، که منتقد اریش ائورباخ در فصل معروف او، «جوراب قهوه‌ای»، در Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature (1946) بسیار بر آن تأکید کرد، جایی که مشاهده کرد که واقعیت «مجاز» یا نویسنده‌ای در این رمان مدرن وجود ندارد، همانطور که در یک اثر سنتی وجود داشته است. در عوض، اشیاء خارجی و رویدادها تنها به عنوان نشانگرهایی برای لحظات در زمان و به عنوان مناسبت‌هایی برای واقعیت‌های داخلی شخصیت‌ها برای اثبات خود قرار می‌گیرند. به راستی، همانند خود فانوس دریایی، یا اشعار پرسه‌زن مستر رمزی، جوراب قهوه‌ای می‌تواند و بسیاری چیزهای مختلف را به معنا کند، که از لحظه‌ای به لحظه‌ای و از شخصیتی به شخصیت دیگر تغییر می‌کند. همانطور با تخت باریک کلاریسا، یا چاقوی جیبی پیتر والش، یا بارانی فرسوده میس کیلمن. پس چه باید کرد با تمام آن گل‌ها؟ وولف به درایت آن را به شخص دیگری می‌سپارد. هر داوطلبی؟ این است که چرا ما خوانندگان پول بزرگ را دریافت می‌کنیم. از رشته‌های اندک، از اشاره‌ها و ادعاها، ما چیزی را که معتقدیم محکم و دائمی است می‌بافیم. ما واقعیت را در شخصیت‌هایی پیدا می‌کنیم که هرگز وجود نداشته‌اند، انگیزه و احساس درونی را از چیزهایی که حمل می‌کنند می‌یابیم، افراد کاملی را از طرح‌ها و اسکیس‌ها می‌سازیم. این، به زبان نقد کتاب، یک اجرای شجاعانه است. شاید ما سزاوار چک‌های حق التألیف باشیم. فقط، برای احتیاط، نفس خود را نگه ندارید."},{"prompt":"Какой орган выраьатывает амфетамин","completion":"Организм человека не вырабатывает амфетамин.

because div shared so many AI agent Secrets I know you're going to love it anyway I saw you recently visited the Llama free team at meta what did you learn from them and did they share any secrets about the 405 billion model I I see them maybe becoming the biggest player especially because like Mark is really con convicted about uh doing this and like building the best offensers models and uh so think this could be very interesting and uh we're looking to collaborate with them and uh see if we can like uh use their capabilities but also maybe like in the future do a partnership where we can like bring our agents to improve u a lot of like different Services across the board so maybe like a locally run version of mulon yeah yeah totally so that could be really cool little sneak peek so why do you think people don't believe in Zak I mean it feels like he almost has this like negative reputation here he has a very like robotic Persona so I think he has a lot of like negative uh maybe slightly negative Public Image but I think like right now it seems to be taking a turn around so I think people are liking him more and maybe they just got a better marketing team how to say but uh they're doing a good job yeah so you are bullish on open source or do you think like a closed source is always going to be like ahead like one to two years or something by the way it's the last 48 hours where if you join my community you will get a personalized AI strategy made just for you and of course you'll get access to all the trainings and workshops as well as two weekly calls where you can talk to me directly if that sounds valuable then make sure to join now because this offer ends in 48 hours um I say it's I'm very bullish on open source because I think open source is catching up they're getting like close to gbd4 um I think the thing like there's no secret Source I think the the only thing that um you need for training a model is like data and lot of compute and maybe like a lot of people who are like know how to like train this model at scale uh the thing is like it's not that hard to get uh um at at a particular level like say for example for MAA and um and so once you have all this like three ingredients you can basically build the best models and then it's all about like the speed and like how much can you itct then the good thing about being open sources you can just build the base models but then people find out use cases they'll find you and they will do a lot of custom things and I think longterm I think open source will beat close source and like okay so you think open source is going to catch up then like what gives the closed Source the main advantage like is it the data is it the compute is it the talent um I'll would say right now it's definitely like the data and U maybe the talent like if you look at like anthropic and open they have a lot of talent there but now what's starting to happen is I think um people are starting to like sort of like I think as open source becomes more common I think people will also have a pressure to open source from different Labs um or like like the tent also keeps moving so like if meta is doing a lot of Open Source Mr is doing a lot of Open Source so there's almost equal access to resources now and uh if you if you imagine like everyone has the same Talent same compute same data and then if one is open source one is closed Source then it makes sense for open source to be more advantageous so like why did we see this like because if you go like 10 years back everything was basically open source right all the research was open so that but then the field kind of went closed now it maybe it's opening up again like why do you think that happened like it's closing down I think one was like uh like I'll just say like uh like uh capit like just profitability so I think like um I will say two things profitability and maybe like a risk so what happened likely is a lot of people thought like this models are going to get super powerful and we can't disclose how we building them um so because that could like lead to maybe like some sort of like issues where like we might have malicious actors doing like what of the crazy things uh and a good like analogy here might be like nuclear bombs for example so last year people thought like okay like this could be like as dangerous as nuclear attack but then people tried it's been one year gbd4 is kind of D everyone knows that at this point and they're like okay F it's like okay like it doesn't really do anything so it's like maybe might as well just like uh put it out there so I don't think like what happened is like it just maybe was that people started fearing like like this research is dangerous so we don't want to go and put it out there for everyone to like replicate this and second was also like u a lot of this like uh when you're training models just ping like Millions to billions of dollars and you need a way to like recoup the cost um and like for open a I think this is basically the business so they need to be have some sort of like Secret SCE that's close source for people to pay them otherwise no one will pay them and they W they will just be losing money um for someone like meta or like even like Google it doesn't matter because they're not making money from Models so the money they can just like train as many models as they want and just give it out for free and it won't impact their business um so it becomes like an interesting strategy for like this bigger companies so you think like making the model itself the bit like the core of the business do you think that's a risk strategy I think so I think like a lot of people are realizing that um and that's where they're trying to like uh move towards like uh new spaces um so open is now doing a lot of like video modeling which is so I think the strategies just keep building better models for different modalities which could be interesting if as long as they are able to like uh be the winner or be the first per like innovator in the space um but I think long term I think they're also trying to go like own the hardware own the model own the maybe have their more applications um so I think at the end I think applications will become the winning thing like if you're building something that's useful people are using it people are loving it people are willing to pay for it I think that's the only sustainable thing uh in the long okay so then why Google doesn't open source anymore like obviously they gave us Gemma but like I'm talking about like the state of the art models right because they did open source the attention is all you need paper and that was like you know the beginning of the Transformer Revolution so why why don't they open source Gemini 1.5 uh totally I think it's inter question um I think and like I've worked in Google and I know how Google philosophy works it's just like very hard there's a lot of legal red tape around doing anything uh and even like releasing research uh papers out there or even like releasing a model open source so I think it's just like very there's a lot of like bureaucratic retp on getting things out there so even if they want to I think they will have a lot of like uh issues doing that um and I think they also don't U um I think they kind of confused I feel in that sense they don't know what exactly is the right strategy like should they copy open AI or should they try to do something different um yeah so so I think they're kind of in the middle place right now where like for meta they're like okay we don't really care we just like put it out there um it's not part of the Core Business okay so then like is that inevitable with scale like will every company hit that kind of bureaucratic ceiling or is it possible to have like a trillion dollar tech tech that innovates just as much as a startup uh I think that's a good question uh yeah that's a good question I think it might be possible it's very hard to say um but uh like even if like x. for example they're doing some stuff and they're also open sourcing a lot of the models um so I do think like uh just because there's so much open source pressure now from like meta and XII and M I think uh it just creates this thing like the winners will might just be open source everyone will have to move towards open source so okay so it does sounds like you think that eventually like Google and open a will also be pressured to be opened do you think that will happen I think they definitely have the pressure like even like if I was like if I was open like like if you if would like open source 3.5 like no one will even care because it's but they don't um right like why so I think it's interesting it's also I think what happens is like once your company starts to grow I think open has started as a nonprofit research but now they're like a for-profit company they um um have a lot of like board control from Microsoft and now they want to become like a profitable business make a lot of U make sure like Okay can they uh ACR a lot of resources and once you think of this as like a like a sort of like a monetary basis it doesn't make any sense for them to open source anything I see so okay then what do you think like Zak's main strategy is because I've seen a lot of people work like confused by this like some people think it's just philosophy some people think it's to like get the community to fine tune the models make them more efficient that way he can save compute in the apps some people think it's to like destroy the entire competition like you know make better free models than everyone is making closed models so what do you think yeah I think I'll would say Facebook is really good at this actually so they did this with like P for example so P eventually uh overtook like T CL and then got the best community support um and and then sort of like became the defao framework uh for like training models so I think meta sees they could do something similar with u uh what they're doing with llama that they can get the best commun option become the standard for any developer who wants to run models uh and they see like this could uh in the long term become like the the best option possible and the good thing for them is like they don't even have to care because it's just like uh it's not impacting their social business because they're like a social network it's like this is just like a arit thing they're doing because they have the money and time but it doesn't really impact their business metrics okay so and then like speaking on the safety do you think that's the safer approach or do you think it's like more risky because I've seen people you know on both sides um I like right now the models are not really capable enough um so I think it's and people have already have access to them for year we have not seen anything major uh risky happening like um over the last year so there's not any sort of like like anything that will flag like okay like this was like a really big uh dangerous thing that someone did with the model um and and so I think like right now I think people feel safe and they have the confidence okay they releasees models out there at this perimeter sizes uh there's nothing harmful that's possible um I'll be more concerned about like agent te Solutions because once you have like more like agent capabilities then like then things can go more wrong because you can build bot Nets you can build like lot of like U spamware malware and then you can like uh and then that could be like really dangerous but if it's just like a model people have already seen and it can't really do much over the last year and now they have the confidence like if maybe something is less than a trilon size panometer it's good enough that you can just put it out there and not worry about it okay so in general like because my theory is that you know if you make something open source then you can take tens of millions of developers and all look through it whereas you know even the biggest research I have is like there what are the red teams like 20 30 maybe 50 people so like my um my theory is that if you have like the entire population looking through the source code that is um probably safer but like in terms of the Bad actors do you think it's more like CU you you mentioned the agent right and do you mean like more of a human taking the agents and doing bad with it like building a bot net or the agents like going off on their own more like Bad actors because like even if you imagine there's a lot of people who are like doing a lot of like uh email spam or like phone scam and stuff like that now suppose like this actors uh got access to like identic capabilities was like okay like now maybe I can go and scam like uh uh like like not me but personally but like suppose some person can go and scam like 10 people now they'll be like okay now I have access to this agent I can go scam like 10,000 people instead of like 10 people and and then you can imagine that that becomes like really bad and especially because you're empowering these Bad actors to do more malicious things and uh and so moderation for these things becomes like how do you moderate this um I I think at the end of the day it's always like there's like going to be some bad actors and it's like okay like how do you prevent them from misusing any sort of new technology that comes out oh and so like isn't like isn't the counterargument to that like if you make it open source you can defend yourself against that because like if you have the same model um or like you know because like most people are good and like most companies are good right so let's say you have like 99 pieces of compute versus one can't you just like make the world's best anti virus or anti- spam system and detect against that uh I think it's possible it's just like uh it's so new you don't even know what you're are like protecting against um and then it's very hard to fight something you don't know about um and so I think it might there might be a race about like a viruses and a antiviruses and stuff like that that might happen uh so we might see some like interesting stuff happening in the ecosystem as Things become more capable um but but I think yeah I think the right way to do that there is like have a lot of moderations so even for the like the Lama modelers are open sour they moderated in the sense like they have G through RF and Alignment so I do think like alignment is very critical uh especially if you are doing any sort of like agentic thing with it and it's not aligned then it might go and like do like illegal stuff or you might just use it for like whatever like uh emptying someone's bank account and then you want to like not uh be able to you want to prevent that and like make sure like okay like that is not possible okay so shifting topics a bit mulon what's your vision behind it and what separates it from other agent tools look we all know that AGI is right around the corner but most people are completely unprepared that's why I created an entire workshop on how to prepare for the Post AGI World which you can access inside of my community by the way in 48 hours the price is going up so if you are serious about AI then make sure to join now see you inside uh the vision behind mulon has been a can you build um almost like a air assistant that can go do a lot of the boring everyday things for you and so like what happens is like um everyone spends a lot of time like say like texting emailing uh travel booking flights booking hotels and there's like a lot of random things you have to do even like say paying rent for example or filing your taxes and it feels like uh why do you have to do this right it's like you're already living in the 22nd century and like there's already like um there like so much technology there's so much AI it kind of feels like you should have something that can go and like do this automatically for you and I think that's what we want to build um with mult so you want this sort of like a your personal AI helper in a sense it's like you have this agent take solution then you can just ask it like okay like go do my Taxas go go fill my whatever like uh spreadsheet for work and like free up a lot of time um because what happens like you spend like I would say 80% of your time on very boring things which basically you don't even need to use your brain capacity you just like um basically using your muscle memory and just like doing the repetive actions again and again but then if you have a a that can just go do this for you it just freezes so much time and then you can focus on a lot of like the things you really enjoy um which are like more high level more creative and I think that's the vision we want to empower like if everyone can have this then that will change uh how we interact with technology how we free of a time and how we like sort of like do things every day and what is the single most common use case you've seen people use multi on for uh totally so I think it's interesting we have seen a variety um I'll say because right now say we have seen a lot of around emailing a lot of people are starting to use it for like sending out emails or even like ker invites uh reservations has been a big one a lot of like restaurant reservation activities like even like you want to book like cinema tickets or concert tickets uh so we've seen a lot of people use our agents to like just go and do it um and our agents are still early but as you're making it more powerful we seeing people also starting to for like okay like can it book a complete trip for me so can it just go book me this like a flight and uh and just like free of my time so I know to go visit the website and uh spend any time on it yeah I mean there's so many of these tasks like throughout the day like it's the concept of like death by Thousand Cuts right so it's not like one thing it's like this takes two minutes this takes three minutes and like I think that's where AI agents could be absolutely huge tot it's like basically everyone having their personal intern in a sense and if some everyone had an intern and they can just delegate as much as possible yeah okay so like talking about agents what do you think will unlock like the next like agent Revolution will it be like better UI or better memory better reasoning or do we need U even better llms I think it'll be a combination of a lot of things but I think at the end what matters is can you build U user trust and can you beable enough um so if you can build an agent that people like trust like okay it's not going to me it's it's it like it's controllable it listens to me it does what I wanted to do and it's second thing is it doesn't fail so it's reliable if I ask you to do something it actually go and do it it won't listen it and tell me like it's done but actually didn't do it because that's really bad um and and so if you can solve the two issues around like trust and reliability I think that's the most important um and then there will be a lot of stuff around like what's the right interaction patterns how do you make it like as um seamless as possible as fun to use as possible um but I think uh yeah so those are like the things where like you need to like sort of like build a like almost like a bond with the user and like if you can build the right Bond and then can like okay like this actually works and like it's is cool and it's actually I I should be using this every day then I think can get out there okay so like today you know because if You' like sure there are AI early adopters who are like all in on agents but like talking about the average person right if youd told them like this is a AI agent it will take care of your inbox you'll be like whoa I don't trust it right like why why don't people still trust agent today like what is the reason I think it's like almost a behavoral change right it's like if you're trying something for the new time you will be a bit skeptical okay like H let's actually go and do it um especially because most people uh I would say don't have that technical expertise so for them it's like a black box like okay like like is this is this like actually true or like is it like a something like fishy um and what we have seen with a lot of our users for example is because U our agents are working on like U uh on a UI level so they're like like controlling UI and like automating like browser tasks it's very visual so you can see what's happening and then you can like actually understand like oh it's doing the right thing and then you can build a trust but if it's like running maybe like fully headlessly invisible and like H I don't know maybe like did send the email did not send the email um there's no way to like fact check and then maybe like once but like if something's visual it's just very easy to like know okay like this seems to work I tried it five times I did it five out of five times now I don't care if it it's running it's running invisibly or it's running in the cloud it's running on the phone I just know like I've seen it to work the UI is really the next billion dollar question in terms of Agents if not more um that's like going to enable the US like the non-technical users to get the advantage of Agents right is that like the vision behind mulon not totally like um like I would say we like to say we are like a technology and Design Group um so we emphasiz on the design because I think if you want to build any consumer experience you need to write just have the uh make it seem as make it like not as intuitive as possible um and and so we're trying to take uh as much philosophy frombe like like places like apple on how we can build the right experience for people to start using agents in every day like um and so the UI actually becomes like very important there where like what's the UI where I can build trust where if something goes wrong I can like still like maybe like use the agent I still like trust this uh can I can we show options to the users because like uh user probably doesn't want uh like they don't want you to just go and like buy any food item or like anything like you say like buy me a burger they don't want like random Burger to just show up your home they want like customization they want like like this is how much I should have this is like restaurants I like so building the at UI where like like the users have a lot of fun exploring the UI engaging with the agent and then like actually like delegate it I think that's a very big challenge right now and I think we are actually doing a lot of like Innovative things where we think we have the right way to do this and now it's all about like like uh getting out there with a lot of users testing it and see if people love what we're building yeah and like I mean I absolutely agree I mean CH gbt was Clear Proof of this because you know gbd3 was available in the playground for like two years and nobody I mean obviously people in AI used it but like nobody from the white public used it uh why do so many tech people underestimate the power of UI yeah I think it's it's just like a what happens is like when you're technical you're just like I think I think you're in a sense like taught to ignore the U because like you're focusing on the technical Parts like what's the underlying technology and so you sort of like have like learned like your brain has learned okay like Let's ignore all the form factor Let's ignore all like things look like and just like focus on the technology because that's the only way you are like sort of like understanding what's going behind the scene and so because you're spending all your time trying to understand what's behind the scene you don't understand what the scene looks like and I think that's and when you're a non person they're like they don't care about what fasy most of the time they care about the scene itself and I think that's posa is like discrepancy where like you just have spent so much time trying to understand what's behind that you're missing out the complete picture so what are the like key aspects of a great UI like I would say Al say UI something that changes um um based on like what you want to do and also like the technology so I think there's this great quote from Steve Jobs uh where he says like design is how it works and so if you're trying to build a new experience um the UI should be like what can get it as seamlessly and as intuitively as possible for the experience that you want to design and I think that sort of becomes like if okay now if you want to design agents what is the right experience or like what's like Bond you want to build is like like uh do you want it to be friendly do you want to like have some sort of empathy do you want to show like this is like trustworthy and then like I think like it's like okay like how can you build a UI that can invoke the kind of experiences that that kind of like um uh bonding with the user and I think you basically have to start with uh what is the final Vision or what's the final goal and then then come back and materialize that into like the the UI and the design form factor so when you're thinking about this for mulon are you like what is the basically the current target audience is it the AI enthusiasts or is it everybody so we starting with a lot of AI Enthusiast like lot of like early Tech adopters but over time we want to Shi to a lot of like uh non-technical Mass Market uh users who just want this in their everyday life and also like for me like like I started this company out of my own personal pinpoint I was like I was doing a phg at sford I was like okay like I just want to like focus on my time like doing research and like writing papers I don't care about all this like uh logistic stuff you have to do uh in your life and I was like okay like it'll be so good to just have something that's doing this for me um and so just like understanding the paino and like relating to the user I think that's very important and and and I think like now we see okay like with all the smart devices that are coming out people are like okay like okay I tried this human P it's cool but like can it actually go and like buy me something or can it actually do something useful for me and I was like okay like this is actually what you're building right and like this what M trying to Sol and like we if you go and like start do Partnerships with all these companies who are building like all the smart Hardwares then we can like build something really useful and something that people already want like people are like trying it like like this seems to be missing we really want this and I like okay like this is exactly what we can offer to people yeah I think that's like a massive thing what people already want like so many of great companies were started where the founder were just solving his own problem like can you speak on the power of that uh I think it's very important because what happens is um with a lot of like like startups or businesses they're trying to like do a lot of like uh user research find the right user profile fit that and like do a lot of like pivoting around like did this work did this not work get ad option cuz you don't understand the user but if you are like just building for yourself you're like okay like this this one user I want to make happy uh I know everything about the user I know what exactly is needed and I'm just building that and then once you build it then it's like extrapolation okay like if you can solve this problem for one person can you not solve this for like 10 10 people now can you solve this for 100 people and then you can extra it um but like what happens is like if you are just trying to solve something which you don't know you're imagining a problem uh and you have like an imaginary person in mind then you don't know what the imagining person exactly actually wants right uh and I think that's what a lot of Founders Miss especially on consumer side you just have to like build for something that you just know about and like that best person usually is just you so at what point did like multi on turn from a personal project to a company um I think this was maybe around last year almost one year ago where ini was building this uh as a side project spending a lot of time on evenings and weekends um and we got it to work really well so I was able to go ask you like say order Burgers on door Das or like send emails or like um shop on Amazon um and then I made this one video on uh Twitter which blew up uh so we had more than a million views and more than a thousand likes and then people really like were like oh like this is super cool we just really want this and then we did a lot of surveys where we had like 10,000 people fill out like a type form fully organically and then we like okay like we're willing to pay like 100 a month if you can actually go and like build this thing I was like okay this seems like crazy like people really seem to want this um and I think that sort of like caus transition like okay let's go and actually build this as a thing that um people other than just me can like go and use it in their everyday life uh and and and I think it's just like fulfilling to just see like when people use things you build and like start using it and you see this adoption it's just like very uh interesting to see as a as an inventor so like a lot of people especially on like the pessimistic side think that you know know AI agents and people that are building them want to replace humans but it sounds to me like you want to actually make people more effective no totally totally I think that's what we see um so so you can think like what happens is U if you're doing like something like uh like even like say filing texes for example it's like okay like you have to spend so much time but if you had an agent that can go just file your taxes for you it's like everyone will be happy I think no one will complain about it and there's also a lot of things where like you have to just spend like crazy amount of time um like uh just like going through different uis or like research and stuff like that but what can happen is we can reduce everything to like maybe like final step approval was like maybe I can go and like find You The Right Flight and we like okay here's the flight option you just choose it and it's done um so instead of like taking like 30 steps like going through all the menus and everything you just like tell the yeah okay just go find me the best things and then you just like confirm like I like this one and so you can reduce everything to like two or three interactions instead of like uh like 30 or 40 interactions and so we see this power where like you still want to empower humans so that the humans are still doing the decision- making but the AI is taking care of all the boring and the parts that you don't really care about and and the second thing we also see is we can allow people to do just more because once you free of time like right now the human brains also like so how the human brain works is it's like single threaded in a sense so we can only do one thing at a time like people like you probably would have heard like you can't you should not do like too many things but once do one thing at a time uh so we don't just we are not genetically wired to be able to like uh spread our Consciousness across 10 different things and like we able to do that together but like if you had like agents and then you can imagine like okay like I just asked the agent like here the 10 Things I care about the agent just goes and does all the 10 things and then gives me okay here's the 10 things I did and then just like approve it like this was good this was bad maybe like do that do this again and then you can just unlock this so much like a capability where now instead of just doing one thing at a time I can maybe just doing like 10 10 things at a time or maybe 100 things at a time and we see that that could be like really really interesting it's almost like a new primitive for us as a humans where now we can just have this like paralyzation power which we didn't have before yeah I think it's almost you know the time is amazing but I think it's almost like saving the mental bandwidth is almost like more valuable right CU like there could be a future where we as people don't even go to any websites we just tell our agent who ask as you said like an intern or a personal assistant that just you know we tell it what we need and it goes and figure out everything else and then it's like basically agents interacting with agents like do you think that's probable yeah I don't think it's going to happen like suppose I had an agent you had an agent it's possible your agent is interacting with my agent yeah and then a lot of mental bandwidth like scheduling this you know we could save both some time like I would say like hey I think uh this this um like would be a really good conversation and my agent okay great checks out your Twitter checks out your email like finds all the contact info uh you know your agent gives a calend deink like he has the free dates and like that would save us both few minutes but like hundreds of these tasks are happening right so like I think that's like really people don't see this because they always want to do this like oh my God agents cannot automate this eight hour thing it's like well okay maybe start at this like two minute thing like that you do every day or every other day that's annoying and like go from there because I mean it's not really like aspirational to automate some two-minute task but like it's the compounding effect right totally totally I think it's all about the compounding effect it's like almost like you have like a small mosquito bites happening all the day and then you might be getting 100 2,000 bites and then if you like remove all the small bites and you just like like uh reducing a lot of like mental load even if you think about like why people get stress it's like you just have to do this all this like things you don't want to do and that causes a lot of stress but if if you don't have to do it I think you you will we can actually reduce a lot of like mental burden stress and overall make people more happy so maybe agents are the key tool living forever maybe Brian Johnson should look into this but yeah okay uh so we we talked about a few use cases like booking flights and stuff like that but how do you personally use AI agents like if you had to say like one or two use cases that you personally find the most valuable what would they be um I definitely like I optimize my life to use agents a lot uh or or I will say basically maybe like our agents optimized towards my life um and so like I I use like like our agents for like say like ordering lunch uh calling Ubers if I'm to office um um even like sending out a lot of emails sending out like documents if I'm sending like any sort of like ndas or any other documents on like Doc sign can just say like okay can you go and like send this like a document to this person and the agent can actually go and do it if you want to like add some people on U like a Google workspace or slack uh then just as simple asent okay like can you go and like add this person create a new account for them or can you ch tweak this setting on on the AWS account or can you spin up this like whatever like a new uh back in VM um and then so it's like it's kind of very convenient because just like okay like uh I don't even have to like like see what's happening because now I just have the stress I know like it's just going to work so I just like delegate okay just go do this and and you just like save so much like mental burden because like I don't have to think about this problem anymore it's it's just like not my uh like it's yeah I don't have to spend any mind space thinking about how to do this it's just like okay I did it and I I give it to this agent and the agent will go and do it for me and from your experience like how often does it happen where the agent is incorrect enough where it like actually matters like I would definely say we are not perfect so maybe I would say one out of 20 times as possible the agent might do something wrong we have built a lot of yeah thanks we have built a lot of mechanisms where it can actually ask you for things so like suppose it confused or maybe it made a mistake like okay like I uh it seems I'm stuck can you help me or like um I don't know how to do this or I don't have this credentials I don't I don't have a login so can you log me in and so we have build this like sort of like a lot of features on where the agent will like ask the user uh when it gets stuck or it doesn't know what to do and we've seen like this is just like very empowering because like in that case like you have this like like inste of just going doing something random and failing it's actually coming back to you and like uh adding you in the loop and then you can give it a correction or you can give it some input and then it can go and like go do the right thing and then the next time it can also remember this so the next time it will like remember like like I did these things and this are the things issues I run into so the next time it can go through and like become better yeah so I mean that just goes like crazy when you have like scale right because if somebody else does this task then whoever does it second like okay the first guy maybe is like let's say 50/50 chance it goes wrong the second guy only 25 and just goes like to zero very very quickly right basically yeah and and I think like you just need things like this to make agents work um and I think people underestimate the power of uh uh crowdsourcing and like there's a lot of network effects which are very hidden uh when it comes to agents but I think that's a like a lot of like uh like small things that matter a lot yeah I imagine like striking the balance of when the agent should ask a question like that's one of the you know big questions because like you don't want it to be annoying but you also don't want it to like the user be completely in the blank yeah like you said like you want the user to still have some input and if the agent gets stuck you want to ask a question but like if it keeps asking every other minute then it's like yeah it can get annoying totally totally so yeah it's definitely question of taste in a sense where like you want to be like like is this uh it's it's almost like uh is it friendly and uh good enough but it's just like not too annoying yeah so it sounds like in the near future all of us will be like managers of multiple different teams of Agents underneath us even people who like aren't really at The Cutting Edge do you agree with this I totally agree with this like uh like for me like uh like for me when when I started as like a solo founder to now managing like a team of like almost like 10 people like I've been through this journey where like like I went from like a solo person like as an individual to now like a manager um like 10 10 humans uh but like now you can imagine like U like I sort of like know how it feels but now I can totally see like everyone having like agents they managing uh and everyone becoming a manager in that sense like okay like I have this like agents that are going and doing things and then I'm managing and like checking like okay did the right thing did something massive and how do you make sure like okay like overall uh everything is working as well as possible so how far away are we from that future where everybody has like 20 agents underneath them um I think we're pretty close I'm not sure like Al might by the end of this year we might have this capability where at least a good amount of people I would say like everyone might be have a lot of this agents that they're just using uh to do a lot of stuff um but I do think like maybe like over the next two or three years I think this transition will happen where you will just have the societal change where people will just get used to it it will become the norm that okay like this is how you should do things like it's like if you don't have this U if you don't have agent like something's wrong with you and I think that's going to happen in the next three years I think will it's almost like having an iPhone or like a phone right so if someone doesn't have a phone it's like why doesn't this person have a phone it's like that's so weird right and same thing happens like why doesn't this person have agencies yeah it be like annoying talking to somebody who doesn't have an agent because they won't respond instantly what everybody else is like instantly responding and instantly booking or like saying if if they're interested it's like you waiting for that one friend that doesn't have any agents like waiting two days for his response like what is he doing yeah totally totally and I think it just happens even if you think about the internet it's like when the internet happened like no one had internet like before 2000s but then afterwards I like everyone has internet like if you don't have internet at your home like like that's something like really weird in that sense so I think it's that's how technology goes I think once everything becomes a norm or then you it's just have the expectation that if 99 people have it then like the the one person who doesn't have it should also have it so do you think in this case like the social adaptation will be faster than the previous Technologies because we've seen like this trend where each um Revolution is like a bit faster than the previous one but like there's still like um if you take companies that are not tech companies and people who are not tech savvy those Take Years sometimes decades to adapt yeah I think this will definitely happen faster um because I agree like what happens with every technology is like it happens faster and faster and people have also gotten used to like fastpaced because everything in the digital world right now is so fast you have so many new trends and so many things happening all the time but the average person doesn't see this like we see this but the average person is clueless still that's fair uh that is fair but I think still people see all the AI they like even like average person has TR gbt at this point um and and I think like but um just because there's like so much like social media right now it's very easy for information to spread so if something goes viral on Tik Tok or Instagram it's very possible like then everyone of your friend if someone likes it then everyone in your community might get it um so I think social media becomes like very empowering where like you didn't have this things 10 years ago so like things took time for information to scbe but now for to sprad for new spread is like very very quick yeah that's actually a really good point that social media will always be like the way to educate about technology because we cannot wait for the school system to you know introduce all of this like if if somebody goes like as you said viral on Tik Tok we like look at my friend he has 20 agents working for him and he's just like gets so much done in a day like that could go super viral right and I think that's how people will probably learn about this basically yeah so you recently announced that you um are receiving shipment of 1,24 h100 what do you hope to train with that uh yeah so I think we are using that for a lot of training so we're training a lot of action models which are very proprietary to us and then we seeing like how can we make them more aligned so how can we like spend a lot of time training them to be more aligned to users so collecting a lot of human feedback lot of collecting a lot of like uh user interaction data scale and making sure that they are as reliable as possible so I think we have set up this interal metric we want to reach like 99% reliability um over the next three months over what our agents are doing I think it's really hard because like even like the best product doesn't have that so so we're not sure if we can get there for everything but for at least like some Focus use cases we want to reach that because then it becomes like clearly usable then have the trust um the second thing is also like inference because like AI is so costly right now um spending a crazy amount of money and like if you like giving this to like say supporting like tens of millions of people and how do you make sure that this is something uh that we can serve without bankrupting ourselves and and can we do that at scale uh and like satisfy the demand and then think then you just need a lot of like computer capacity to do that really well yeah what people don't realize is that meta is spending 90% of their gpus on inference and only 10% on training the new models kind of crazy yeah it's kind of yeah so uh apart from on what do you think is the most promising project in the AI field right now yeah I think it's very interesting um there's definitely a lot of activity happening right now um especially on like if you look at robotics as a space um I think I'm starting to get more bullish on robotics taking starting to take off uh with all this like human robotic startups but also like a bunch of like other startups that like getting out there so I think um very bullish and like seeing robots uh in like maybe like on sidewalks on on roads at a start but maybe like then in like restaurants or hotels even your personal like day um so I think I do think like that seem will be like very interesting and I think it's it's kind of crazy how fast things are moving because like if you think about like we will have a you you will imagine like having like the doorboards and stuff like that people thought like that take like 30 years 50 years but everything seems to be happening so fast so how far do you think it is like until everybody has a robot that can do the chores and stuff like that like that's actually affordable not for like 200k maybe for like 10,000 20,000 yeah hard to say I think maybe in the next five years um it's possible like yeah I say my timeline will be like 5 years where you might have like robots that you're just starting to use in your households um and robots can be very cheap actually because like you don't really need much for a robot you need a lot of motors and you need a lot of like uh uh like different like Parts but uh uh overall I think robots are like cheaper to manufacture yeah but like um there is much more like the speed of you know getting them out there is much slower than software obviously yeah do you think do you think like we need basically the physical part of robots to like get to something like AGI or can it happen like just software yeah I think depends how you define AGI because I AGI is very uh abstract so what is what is your definition I I will say something that uh generally super intelligent so if it can beat humans maybe in like uh uh 10 different specialized tasks I will call that okay like this is like good enough to classify as a AGI um and and then there's a lot of like tuning test and like a lot of different things people try to go for um I do think like you can could call something like a digital AGI versus like a physical AGI uh so it's possible you can have like an agent that's like really really good at like understanding everything on the internet and that could be like okay like it just knows everything that's possible like if you think about something like Javis as a concept from Iron Man like I would call it like maybe like that's sort of like AGI that's like digital it knows everything on the internet it doesn't have a physical form but uh maybe you don't need that uh knowledge to forther to classify s yeah so like it basically like the home robots and stuff like that it's it's kind of like the agent but like in the physical form right because um you know it's a good save like this two minute Task 5 minute T taking the trash the same things that agents can do on your browser or computer but in your home day-to-day life right basically yeah so what is the like most impressive robot you've seen so far is this like a physical robot or a digal one well yeah physical robot I say I'm very impressed with like what Tesla is doing so all the Tesla about stuff I think uh I'm not sure like how well does it actually work right now but uh I think it's very it's usually not good to bet bet against Elon like uh usually Elon to win when it comes to this kind of things so I I just see them doing very interesting stuff in this space yeah I mean like the Optimus 2 was like a huge Improvement and it was like only like six months after the first version right so like the rate of progress in Robos is also speeding up like people do not realize this yeah not totally things are moving crazy it's also like there almost like an exponential cycle like things don't real people don't realize this but things compound so if something is like 1X then become 2x then 4X then 8X so it's it's not linear and like so like what Tesla the trajectory they on like if they can just keep making everything 2x better they'll probably have like almost even board in like I don't know three years maximum five years so then why is there recently such a feeling of like we a slowing down in the AI space I've seen so many tweets about this that like oh we're approaching the limits like that but like to me it seems like there are so many exponentials going that sure if one of them seems to be like slowing down there's like 20 others to be like um hold the support right yeah not totally I agree on this I think um LM as themselves may be slow enough because I think people don't know what's next how do you improve this LMS more can you can you just like put more compute or do you just get more scale so maybe the exponentials are saturating for llms in a sense but like if it comes to lot of this physic IAL Hardware a lot of this like maybe like agents and I think those exponentials are just starting um but I think what happens is everything has a saturation point and I think we are maybe reaching some sort of saturation point for like just uh how big can you make LMS yeah so like do you think gp5 will be a huge upgrade or do you think it will be like a small bump because a lot of depends on this a lot of people think that this model will like prove um how the scaling laws look yeah I think it's it's going to be I say what I've heard it's it's it's going to be big leap but not as big as like 3.5 to4 okay so it'll be very impressive but um um maybe not as big as like how four was okay so yeah I mean I'm trying to see like what that is but like I think for agents it could be like especially important because we see like with um you know current even state-ofthe-art models the current version still often cannot handle more than like 710 tools and you know often lose like with more complicated tasks they don't know what to do so like how big do you think it will be a do you think like basically the leap in for agents will be bigger than just the raw llm power um I think so I think so I think you just need a lot of better planning so I think like what's missing right now is like better planning better memory and uh also like better function calling because like what happens with a lot of this like LM is like they get confused like if they're calling more than 10 functions they don't know what to choose they will just like call arbitary things um and I think so we still need a lot of like unfortunately the recording gets cut off here but if you learned anything from this interview then make sure to follow div on Twitter and also check out mulon it's one

Excerpt from \\"The Last Leaf\\" by O. Henry Toward winter a cold stranger entered Greenwich Village. No one could see him. He walked around touching one person here and another there with his icy fingers. He was a bad sickness. Doctors called him Pneumonia. On the east side of the city he hurried, touching many people; but in the narrow streets of Greenwich Village he did not move so quickly. Mr. Pneumonia was not a nice old gentleman. A nice old gentleman would not hurt a weak little woman from California. But Mr. Pneumonia touched Johnsy with his cold fingers. She lay on her bed almost without moving, and she looked through the window at the wall of the house next to hers. One morning the busy doctor spoke to Sue alone in the hall, where Johnsy could not hear. \\"She has a very small chance,\\" he said. \\"She has a chance, if she wants to live. If people don't want to live, I can't do much for them. Your little lady has decided that she is not going to get well. Is there something that is troubling her?\\" \\"Paint! Not paint. Is there anything worth being troubled about? A man?\\" \\"A man?\\" said Sue. \\"Is a man worth-No, doctor. There is not a man.\\" \\"It is weakness,\\" said the doctor. \\"I will do all I know how to do. But when a sick person begins to feel that he's going to die, half my work is useless. Talk to her about new winter clothes. If she were interested in the future, her chances would be better.\\" After the doctor had gone, Sue went into the workroom to cry. Then she walked into Johnsy's room. She carried some of her painting materials, and she was singing. Johnsy lay there, very thin and very quiet. Her face was turned toward the window. Sue stopped singing, thinking that Johnsy was asleep. Sue began to work. As she worked she heard a low sound, again and again. She went quickly to the bedside. Johnsy's eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting- counting back. \\"Twelve,\\" she said; and a little later, \\"Eleven\\"; and then, \\"Ten,\\" and, \\"Nine\\"; and then, \\"Eight,\\" and, \\"Seven,\\" almost together. Sue looked out the window. What was there to count? There was only the side wall of the next house, a short distance away. The wall had no window. An old, old tree grew against the wall. The cold breath of winter had already touched it. Almost all its leaves had fallen from its dark branches. \\"What is it, dear?\\" asked Sue. \\"Six,\\" said Johnsy, in a voice still lower. \\"They're falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. It hurt my head to count them. But now it's easy. There goes another one. There are only five now.\\" \\"Five what, dear? Tell your Sue.\\" \\"Leaves. On the tree. When the last one falls, I must go, too. I've known that for three days. Didn't the doctor tell you?\\" \\"Oh, I never heard of such a thing,\\" said Sue. \\"It doesn't have any sense in it. What does an old tree have to do with you? Or with your getting well? And you used to love that tree so much. Don't be a little fool. The doctor told me your chances for getting well. He told me this morning. He said you had very good chances! Try to eat a little now. And then I'll go back to work. And then I can sell my picture, and then I can buy something more for you to eat to make you strong.\\" \\"You don't have to buy anything for me,\\" said Johnsy. She still looked out the window. \\"There goes another. No, I don't want anything to eat. Now there are four. I want to see the last one fall before night. Then I'll go, too.\\" \\"Johnsy, dear,\\" said Sue, \\"will you promise me to close your eyes and keep them closed? Will you promise not to look out the window until I finish working? I must have this picture ready tomorrow. I need the light; I can't cover the window.\\" \\"Couldn't you work in the other room?\\" asked Johnsy coldly. \\"I'd rather be here by you,\\" said Sue. \\"And I don't want you to look at those leaves.\\" \\"Tell me as soon as you have finished,\\" said Johnsy. She closed her eyes and lay white and still. \\"Because I want to see the last leaf fall. I have done enough waiting. I have done enough thinking. I want to go sailing down, down, like one of those leaves.\\" \\"Try to sleep,\\" said Sue. \\"I must call Behrman to come up here. I want to paint a man in this picture, and I'll make him look like Behrman. I won't be gone a minute. Don't try to move till I come back.\\" Old Behrman was a painter who lived on the first floor of their house. He was past sixty. He had had no success as a painter. For forty years he had painted, without ever painting a good picture. He had always talked of painting a great picture, a masterpiece, but he had never yet started it. He got a little money by letting others paint pictures of him. He drank too much. He still talked of his great masterpiece. And he believed that it was his special duty to do everything possible to help Sue and Johnsy. Sue found him in his dark room, and she knew that he had been drinking. She could smell it. She told him about Johnsy and the leaves on the vine. She said that she was afraid that Johnsy would indeed sail down, down like the leaf. Her hold on the world was growing weaker.","completion":"O. Henry's \\"The Last Leaf\\" is a masterclass in tone, achieved through the adept utilization of various literary devices, notably personification, metaphor, and paradox. These elements coalesce to create a narrative that resonates with themes of hope, sacrifice, and the indomitable human spirit, subtly encapsulated within a somber yet ultimately uplifting tone. The personification of pneumonia as a sinister visitor to Greenwich Village is a poignant example. Describing the disease as a \\"cold stranger\\" with \\"icy fingers\\" who does not \\"move so quickly\\" through the narrow streets immediately imbues the story with a sense of foreboding and malevolence. This personification serves a dual purpose: it externalizes the internal battle against illness, making the abstraction of disease something tangible to fear and fight, and it sets the stage for a darker tone colored by the struggle for survival in the face of an implacable enemy. The use of the vine and its leaves as a metaphor for life and the inevitability of death underlines the story’s exploration of mortality and the human will to live. Johnsy's fixation on the falling leaves as a countdown to her own demise transforms a simple, natural occurrence into a powerful representation of her despair and resignation. This metaphor not only crafts an intimate connection between the character and her environment but also subtly shifts the tone from despairing to hopeful as the narrative progresses. When the last leaf does not fall, thanks to Behrman's sacrifice, this metaphor culminates in a moment of profound realization for Johnsy. It's a poignant reminder of life's fragility and the impact of altruism, altering the story's tone to one of renewed hope and admiration for the selfless acts that define humanity. Paradox plays a significant role in \\"The Last Leaf\\" through the juxtaposition of death and the will to live. Johnsy's initial wish for death as leaves fall is a direct contrast to her survival against odds, mirroring the paradox of life's fragility and its resilience. Behrman's act—painting the last leaf, sacrificing himself to pneumonia, embodies the paradox of achieving one's greatest work and fulfilling one’s purpose at the end of life. This element of paradox deepens the narrative, enriching the tone with layers of complexity as it explores the coexistence of hope and despair, highlighting the unexpected outcomes that can emerge from the bleakest conditions. In conclusion, \\"The Last Leaf\\" by O. Henry is a testament to his literary prowess, seamlessly weaving personification, metaphor, and paradox to craft a story that is as moving as it is profound. These devices work in concert to navigate the shifts in tone across the narrative, guiding the reader from a place of somber reflection on the realities of life and death to a hopeful contemplation of human resilience and the power of sacrifice. Through this intricate emotional landscape, O. Henry delivers a timeless message on the essence of hope and the human capacity to find light in the darkest of shadows."},{"prompt":"ZeroGPT is designed and trained using various algorithms to detect AI content.

Excerpt from “The Last Leaf” by O. Henry Toward winter a cold stranger entered Greenwich Village. No one could see him. He walked around touching one person here and another there with his icy fingers. He was a bad sickness. Doctors called him Pneumonia. On the east side of the city he hurried, touching many people; but in the narrow streets of Greenwich Village he did not move so quickly. Mr. Pneumonia was not a nice old gentleman. A nice old gentleman would not hurt a weak little woman from California. But Mr. Pneumonia touched Johnsy with his cold fingers. She lay on her bed almost without moving, and she looked through the window at the wall of the house next to hers. One morning the busy doctor spoke to Sue alone in the hall, where Johnsy could not hear. “She has a very small chance,” he said. “She has a chance, if she wants to live. If people don’t want to live, I can’t do much for them. Your little lady has decided that she is not going to get well. Is there something that is troubling her?” “Paint! Not paint. Is there anything worth being troubled about? A man?” “A man?” said Sue. “Is a man worth-No, doctor. There is not a man.” “It is weakness,” said the doctor. “I will do all I know how to do. But when a sick person begins to feel that he’s going to die, half my work is useless. Talk to her about new winter clothes. If she were interested in the future, her chances would be better.” After the doctor had gone, Sue went into the workroom to cry. Then she walked into Johnsy’s room. She carried some of her painting materials, and she was singing. Johnsy lay there, very thin and very quiet. Her face was turned toward the window. Sue stopped singing, thinking that Johnsy was asleep. Sue began to work. As she worked she heard a low sound, again and again. She went quickly to the bedside. Johnsy’s eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting- counting back. “Twelve,” she said; and a little later, “Eleven”; and then, “Ten,” and, “Nine”; and then, “Eight,” and, “Seven,” almost together. Sue looked out the window. What was there to count? There was only the side wall of the next house, a short distance away. The wall had no window. An old, old tree grew against the wall. The cold breath of winter had already touched it. Almost all its leaves had fallen from its dark branches. “What is it, dear?” asked Sue. “Six,” said Johnsy, in a voice still lower. “They’re falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. It hurt my head to count them. But now it’s easy. There goes another one. There are only five now.” “Five what, dear? Tell your Sue.” “Leaves. On the tree. When the last one falls, I must go, too. I’ve known that for three days. Didn’t the doctor tell you?” “Oh, I never heard of such a thing,” said Sue. “It doesn’t have any sense in it. What does an old tree have to do with you? Or with your getting well? And you used to love that tree so much. Don’t be a little fool. The doctor told me your chances for getting well. He told me this morning. He said you had very good chances! Try to eat a little now. And then I’ll go back to work. And then I can sell my picture, and then I can buy something more for you to eat to make you strong.” “You don’t have to buy anything for me,” said Johnsy. She still looked out the window. “There goes another. No, I don’t want anything to eat. Now there are four. I want to see the last one fall before night. Then I’ll go, too.” “Johnsy, dear,” said Sue, “will you promise me to close your eyes and keep them closed? Will you promise not to look out the window until I finish working? I must have this picture ready tomorrow. I need the light; I can’t cover the window.” “Couldn’t you work in the other room?” asked Johnsy coldly. “I’d rather be here by you,” said Sue. “And I don’t want you to look at those leaves.” “Tell me as soon as you have finished,” said Johnsy. She closed her eyes and lay white and still. “Because I want to see the last leaf fall. I have done enough waiting. I have done enough thinking. I want to go sailing down, down, like one of those leaves.” “Try to sleep,” said Sue. “I must call Behrman to come up here. I want to paint a man in this picture, and I’ll make him look like Behrman. I won’t be gone a minute. Don’t try to move till I come back.” Old Behrman was a painter who lived on the first floor of their house. He was past sixty. He had had no success as a painter. For forty years he had painted, without ever painting a good picture. He had always talked of painting a great picture, a masterpiece, but he had never yet started it. He got a little money by letting others paint pictures of him. He drank too much. He still talked of his great masterpiece. And he believed that it was his special duty to do everything possible to help Sue and Johnsy. Sue found him in his dark room, and she knew that he had been drinking. She could smell it. She told him about Johnsy and the leaves on the vine. She said that she was afraid that Johnsy would indeed sail down, down like the leaf. Her hold on the world was growing weaker.","completion":"O. Henry's \\"The Last Leaf\\" is a vivid testament to the power of hope and the human spirit, manifesting through the adept use of various literary devices. Among these, personification, metaphor, and paradox stand out prominently, each contributing uniquely to the tone of the story—a tone that oscillates between despair and hope, ultimately resting on an uplifting note of self-sacrifice and survival. **Personification** is employed from the outset, turning an inanimate entity, disease (pneumonia), into a malevolent character that roams the village, selecting its victims. This anthropomorphic treatment of the disease not only encapsulates the indiscriminate terror it spreads but also sets a somber tone that hovers over the narrative. However, this somberness is not without purpose; it serves to amplify the impact of the hope and tenacity that later counters the initial dread. By giving pneumonia human attributes, O. Henry effectively bridges the gap between the seen and unseen, making the intangible threat of death a tangible adversary that his characters, and thereby readers, can confront. The use of **metaphor**, particularly through the falling leaves of the ivy vine as an analogue for Johnsy's dwindling hope and life force, ingeniously conveys the fragility of life and the proximity of death. As Johnsy counts each leaf falling, believing her life to be symbiotically linked to the vine, readers are drawn into a reflective contemplation on the nature of life and the often arbitrary symbols we attach our hopes to. This metaphor extends the story's tone from one of mere melancholy to a deeper contemplation of existence, resilience, and the sometimes inexplicable anchors of our will to live. Perhaps the most compelling literary device O. Henry employs is the **paradox**, particularly embodied in the outcome of Behrman's self-sacrifice. Behrman, an unsuccessful old artist who dreams of creating a masterpiece, finally creates it in an unexpected manner—by painting the last leaf on the wall, a leaf that never falls, despite the winter storm. This act, his last, is paradoxical because it represents both a deception and the ultimate truth; it's a lie that conveys a profound truth about hope, igniting the will to live in Johnsy. The paradox of the leaf's fragility and permanence mirrors the paradox of human existence—vulnerable yet sustained by indomitable spirits and acts of sacrifice. This element significantly enriches the tone of the story, imbuing it with layers that respect the complexity of human emotions and resilience. In sum, O. Henry’s \\"The Last Leaf\\" skillfully marries personification, metaphor, and paradox to navigate the thematic and tonal landscapes of despair, hope, and sacrifice. These literary devices are not merely ornaments but are integral to expressing the story's essence, accentuating its emotive force, and enabling readers to traverse from a sense of somber resignation to an uplifting realization of the power of hope and human connection. Through these elements, O. Henry crafts a narrative that is as much about confronting death as it is about celebrating life and the often understated acts of heroism that define it."},{"prompt":"Consider the following decision making int value = 10; statements: if (value > 10 ) Which of the following statements is correct?

However, the line \`1cv == 6;\` is logically incorrect – it seems to be a typo and does not perform any operation. It looks like the intent was to decrement \`lcv\` but was written incorrectly. Assuming the intention was to decrement \`lcv\` in the loop and the condition \`lcv == 6\` is either a misinterpretation or a typo (since it's an equality check rather than an assignment or a decrement operation), we could correct and infer the purpose of the loop as follows: \`\`\`java int a = 13; int lcv = 36; while (lcv >= 0) { a = -1; lcv--; // Assuming the intention was to decrement lcv on each iteration } \`\`\` This interpretation assumes you were looking to decrement \`lcv\` in each iteration of the \`while\` loop until \`lcv\` is no longer greater than or equal to 0.

This method does not return a value (it returns \`void\`). Attempting to assign its result to a double variable \`c\` will cause a compilation error because you cannot assign \`void\` to a variable. 2. **Method Call B**: \`int d = pt.setDestination(\\"here\\");\` - The \`setDestination\` method is defined as \`public void setDestination(String newDest)\`. Similar to \`setWeight\`, this method also returns \`void\` and does not return any value. Trying to assign its result to an integer variable \`d\` will also lead to a compilation error for the same reason as above. 3. **Method Call C**: \`double c = pt.getCost(5.5);\` - There is no \`getCost\` method defined or mentioned in the provided class definition for \`Package\`. Given only the provided information, it's unclear whether a \`getCost\` method exists. Since it's not in the provided snippet, under the assumption that we are assessing based solely on the given code, this call appears invalid. However, it's important to note that the compilation error here doesn't stem from an improper attempt to capture a \`void\` return value like in options A and B, but from the method's absence in the provided code. Given this discrepancy and considering the intent might be to point out which method call syntax is correct assuming the method exists and returns a \`double\`, this requires a minor leap of assumption beyond the provided details. Based on the class definition and available methods within, **none of the provided method calls compile as they're described.** However, since the context might involve assessing understanding of syntactical correctness assuming all methods exist as implied by their usage: - A and B are explicitly incorrect due to trying to assign \`void\` methods’ output to variables. - C seems like a trick question without the \`getCost\` method being defined, but it has the most plausible syntax if \`getCost\` were a method that existed and returned a double, which lines up with the variable assignment on the left. Despite this, it's important to know it does not compile with the given class definition as there is no \`getCost\` method present. Given the strict interpretation based on only the provided code and instructions, it would be accurate to state that directly from the shown class specification, none of the calls would compile correctly due to various reasons. The question appears to aim at understanding of method signatures and return types but lacks complete alignment with the provided class structure for \`C\`. Consequently, under strict adherence to the provided information and without assuming additional methods, all options are technically incorrect.

Let's analyze each option against these criteria and what's already defined in the \`PlayableCharacter\` class: A. **public boolean setHuman(boolean human)** - This is a method designed to possibly set the \`isHuman\` field of the \`PlayableCharacter\` class. Since there is already a \`boolean\` field named \`isHuman\`, and no method with the same name and parameter list exists in the provided class definition, this method could validly be added to the class. It aligns with Java naming conventions for setter methods and would be a typical method to have in such a class for changing the character's \`isHuman\` status. B. **public int getNumLives(int m)** - Given that there's already a method named \`getNumLives()\` that takes no parameters and returns an \`int\`, this proposed method signature introduces a method with the same name but a different parameter list (in this case, a single \`int\` parameter). While overloading allows methods to share a name if they have different parameter lists, this particular method header does not make conceptual sense as a \\"get\\" method because \\"get\\" methods typically do not require parameters; they are used to retrieve the current state of an object's attribute. The presence of a parameter suggests manipulation or a requirement for input which contrasts with the convention of \\"get\\" methods being idempotent (i.e., they do not alter the state of an object and do not require external inputs to perform their task). However, based purely on syntax and Java's rules regarding overloading, this method could technically be added, but its practical design is questionable. C. **public int getNumLives()** - This method header matches exactly an existing method in the provided class definition, which returns the number of lives (\`myNumLives\`) a \`PlayableCharacter\` has. Adding another method with the exact same signature—same name and same parameter list (in this case, no parameters)—is not allowed in Java. It would lead to a compile-time error because the compiler would not be able to differentiate between the two when the method is called. Therefore, based on the ability to be added without causing a compile-time error and considering proper design and usage of methods: **C. public int getNumLives()** can NOT be added to the \`PlayableCharacter\` class because a method with that exact signature already exists in the class."},{"prompt":"Use the following class to answer the question. public class PlayableCharacter { private String myName; private double myHealth; private int myNumLives; private boolean isHuman; public PlayableCharacter() { myName=\\"none\\"; myHealth = 0; myNumLives = 0; isHuman false; Which of the following method headers can NOT be added to the PlayableCharacter class?

Since there is no existing \`setHuman\` method, this method can be added to the \`PlayableCharacter\` class. It follows Java conventions for naming setter methods, where the method's purpose is to set or update the value of a class field. B. **public int getNumLives(int m)** - This method header introduces an overloaded version of the already defined \`getNumLives()\` method. Overloading allows multiple methods to have the same name but different parameter lists. However, the \`getNumLives()\` method typically signifies a getter method, which should not require parameters to fetch a property value. Although syntactically this can be added (because of different method signatures), conceptually and conventionally, a getter method taking parameters is unconventional and potentially misleading. Yet, strictly speaking, from a compilation standpoint, it could be added to the class. C. **public int getNumLives()** - This method already exists in the class with the exact definition as indicated, meaning another method with the exact same signature (name and parameter list) cannot be added. Java does not allow two methods with the exact same signature in the same class as it causes ambiguity and a compilation error. Considering the explanations above: **C. public int getNumLives()** can NOT be added to the \`PlayableCharacter\` class, because a method with that exact signature (name and parameter structure) already exists in the class definition.

There's a critical oversight in the \`for\` loop syntax that reveals a compile-time error. The increment (or update) part of the \`for\` loop is typically crucial for changing the loop variable (\`lcv\` in this case) to eventually meet the loop termination condition. In the provided loop: \`\`\`java for (int lcv = 1; lcv <= 8; lcv) { // Loop body } \`\`\` The increment expression \`lcv\` is provided without an actual operation that modifies its value (like \`lcv++\` or \`lcv += 1\` etc.). This would result in an infinite loop if the code were to execute, but more importantly, as written, it's a compile-time misunderstanding (or logical error) because typically an increment or decrement operation is expected here, not a value or variable itself. This omission not only breaks loop expected functionality (leading to potentially infinite execution) but in the context of compile-time evaluation, it's more about the logical flow rather than a syntactical error per se, from most compilers' perspectives. However, looking at the specific component, \`\`\`java System.out.println(\\"lcv = \\" - lcv); \`\`\` This line attempts to concatenate a string with an integer using a subtraction operator (\`-\`), which is indeed a syntactical error. Valid string concatenation in Java is done using the \`+\` operator, not the \`-\` operator.

Yet, their place in educational settings, particularly in classrooms, has become a topic of heated debate. I stand firm in the belief that students should not be allowed to have cell phones in class due to their potential to distract from learning, the possibility of encouraging academic dishonesty, and the negative impact on classroom dynamics. From buzzing notifications to the tempting lure of social media, cell phones are a constant source of distraction. Even the most disciplined students can find it hard to resist the pull of their digital devices. A study by the Journal of Communication Education found that students who use their phones for non-educational purposes during class hours show lower academic performance. This indicates that the presence of cell phones can significantly impede students' ability to absorb and retain information being taught, undermining the core objective of education. Moreover, cell phones in the classroom open the door to academic dishonesty. With access to the internet, students can easily find answers to quizzes, share test questions, or plagiarize assignments, all at the tap of a screen. This not only devalues the education system but also robs students of the opportunity to engage deeply with the material, develop critical thinking skills, and learn from the process of intellectual challenge. Another critical aspect to consider is the impact of cell phones on classroom dynamics. Education is not just about transmitting information; it's about building relationships, fostering discussions, and creating an environment where ideas can be shared openly. The presence of cell phones can hinder these interactions, as students may be more engaged with their screens than with their classmates or teachers. This barrier to face-to-face communication detracts from the richness of the learning experience. Opponents might argue that cell phones can be a valuable educational tool, offering access to learning apps and resources. While it's true that technology can enhance learning, the disciplined use of specific educational devices controlled by the school is a more effective strategy. This allows educators to harness the benefits of digital resources without succumbing to the drawbacks of unrestricted cell phone use. In conclusion, the banishment of cell phones from classrooms is not a rejection of technology but a commitment to preserving the sanctity of the educational environment. It acknowledges the unique value of focused learning, academic integrity, and interpersonal interaction in shaping the minds of students. By relegating cell phones to the periphery of the classroom, we prioritize education and ensure that students reap the full benefits of their learning journey. Therefore, embracing this approach is not just beneficial but essential in maintaining the efficacy and integrity of our educational institutions."},{"prompt":"10 cm^3 cube made of snow, equals to 3 m^3 water","completion":"There seems to be a misunderstanding in the comparison you've provided. Let's clarify the volumes and the relationship between snow and water, especially when talking about their conversion. Firstly, the volume of a cube that's 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm (10 cm^3 is a misunderstanding; it should be 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm = 1000 cm^3 or 1 liter) is equivalent to 0.001 cubic meters (m^3) of snow, assuming it's fully compacted without any air gaps. This volume of snow, when melted, theoretically gives you roughly the same volume of water, which is also 0.001 cubic meters or 1 liter, not 3 cubic meters. The statement \\"10 cm^3 cube made of snow, equals to 3 m^3 water\\" is not accurate both in terms of the volume of the cube and the conversion between snow and water. Snow's density can vary significantly based on its condition (fresh, compacted, wet), but in general, when melted, the volume of water obtained from snow is much less than the original volume of the snow. However, it does not convert anywhere near 1 liter of snow to 3 cubic meters of water. If there's a specific scenario or concept you're asking about in relation to snow and water volume conversion, could you please provide more details?"},{"prompt":"My 10 cm^3 cube made of snow, equals to 3 m^3 water","completion":"It seems there might be a misunderstanding or a mistake in the comparison you're making between a cube of snow and its equivalent volume in water. Let's clarify how snow and water volumes relate to each other. Firstly, snow and water have different densities. The density of water is about 1,000 kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³). Snow density, however, varies widely depending on its condition (fresh, compact, wet, etc.) but is generally much lower than water's density because snow is composed of ice crystals with lots of air spaces in between. Fresh snow might have a density as low as about 50 to 100 kg/m³, while compacted snow might have a density closer to 200 to 800 kg/m³. The statement that a 10 cm³ cube of snow equals 3 m³ of water seems incorrect because: 1. A 10 cm³ cube of snow is a very small quantity (it's a cube with sides of only about 2.15 cm), and converting its volume directly to the equivalent volume of water doesn't change the volume, only the state and possibly the density. If you melt 10 cm³ of snow, you will get 10 cm³ of water, assuming there's no compaction or evaporation. 2. Most importantly, 10 cm³ of snow does not \\"equal\\" 3 m³ of water in any straightforward conversion of states. To suggest that such a tiny amount of snow could produce 3 cubic meters of water (which is 3,000,000 cm³) is a gross overestimation. If there's a specific context or concept you're trying to understand or explain regarding the relationship between a volume of snow and the equivalent volume of water it might produce when melted, please provide more details. Generally, the equivalent volume of water obtained from melting snow is less about an increase in volume and more about the change in density since water is much denser than snow. Consequently, the volume reduces when snow is melted down to water, not increases."},{"prompt":"What percent of Americans go to university?","completion":"As of my last knowledge update in September 2023, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), in 2020, about 62.7% of recent high school completers were enrolled in colleges or universities.

The density of 1 ton/cm³ (which is equivalent to 1,000,000 kg/m³) is far beyond the density of any form of snow or ice and is more in line with the densities of extremely dense materials, far denser than any material we encounter in everyday life on Earth.

Bentham's philosophy, closely associated with utilitarianism, aims to promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. He sought a systematic way to quantify happiness and pain, treating them as the key factors in determining the moral rightness of an action. The Hedonistic Calculus considers several factors or dimensions to evaluate the potential consequences of actions in terms of their capacity to produce pleasure and avoid pain. These factors are: 1. **Intensity**: How intense is the pleasure or pain? 2. **Duration**: How long will the pleasure or pain last? 3. **Certainty or Uncertainty**: How likely is it that the pleasure or pain will occur? 4. **Propinquity or Remoteness**: How soon will the pleasure or pain occur? 5. **Fecundity**: What is the probability that the action will be followed by sensations of the same kind (i.e., if the action will lead to more pleasure or pain)? 6. **Purity**: What is the probability that the action will not be followed by sensations of the opposite kind (i.e., the action causes only pleasure without leading to future pain, or vice versa)? 7. **Extent**: How many people will be affected by the pleasure or pain? Bentham believed that, by systematically evaluating these factors, one could make rational decisions about how to act morally, with the ideal action being the one that produces the greatest net pleasure (when subtracting any associated pain) for the greatest number of people. This approach was revolutionary at the time, as it proposed a quantifiable method for ethical decision-making, contrasting with moral principles based on tradition, intuition, or religious dictates. While the idea of quantitatively measuring pleasure and pain faced criticism for being overly simplistic or impractical given the complexity of human emotions and moral situations, Hedonistic Calculus remains a foundational concept in utilitarian ethics, influencing subsequent ethical theories and debates on the nature of happiness, morality, and the best way to live and make decisions that affect others."},{"prompt":"Easy language please","completion":"Sure, let's simplify that! Hedonistic Calculus is a way thought up by Jeremy Bentham, a philosopher, to figure out how much happiness or sadness an action might cause. Bentham believed in making as many people as possible happy with our actions. To do this, he suggested we think about a few key things: 1. **Intensity**: How strong will the happiness or sadness be? 2. **Duration**: How long will the happiness or sadness last? 3. **Certainty**: How sure are we that it will make us happy or sad? 4. **When**: How soon will it make us happy or sad? 5. **Fecundity**: Will this action likely lead to more happiness or sadness later? 6. **Purity**: Is it only going to result in happiness, without causing some sadness later (or vice versa)? 7. **Extent**: How many people will it make happy or sad? By thinking about these factors, Bentham believed we could make better decisions that lead to the most happiness for the most people. His idea was about trying to measure happiness to help us be more moral and make choices that are good for everyone. Even though it sounds like a practical approach, it's pretty hard to measure happiness this way because people feel things differently and what makes one person happy might not affect another person in the same way. But Bentham's idea was an important starting point for talking about how to make decisions that are good for the most people."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

If you want to isolate or remove the dubbed audio, the method you can use will largely depend on how the audio is mixed in your file. Here's a general approach to tackle the problem: # Step 1: Analyze the Audio Tracks First, you'll need to determine how the audio tracks are configured in your movie file: - **Stereo Mix**: Sometimes, the original audio is on one channel (left or right), and the dub is on the other. This is more straightforward to fix. - **Single Mixed Track**: If both the original audio and the dub are mixed into a single mono or stereo track, separating them can be very challenging and might not yield perfect results. # Using VLC Media Player (For Simple Channel Issues) If the issue is simply that the original audio and the dub are on separate stereo channels, you might be able to isolate one channel using VLC Media Player: 1. **Open VLC Media Player** and load your movie file. 2. **Go to Audio** > **Audio Track** and see if there are separate tracks for the original and the dubbed audio. If so, simply switch to the one you want. 3. If the dub and original audio are on separate left/right channels in the same track, navigate to **Tools** > **Effects and Filters** > **Audio Effects** > **Spatializer** or **Stereo Mode**, where you might be able to select \\"Left\\" or \\"Right\\" only, isolating one of the audio tracks. # Using Audio Editing Software (For More Complex Issues) For more complex issues where the audio is intermingled in a single track, software like Audacity might offer some tools to help, though the success rate can vary: 1. **Download and install Audacity** or similar audio editing software. 2. **Extract the audio** from the video using a video editor or a tool like FFmpeg, then import it into Audacity. 3. If the spoken languages in the original audio and the dub are different, you might attempt to minimize the dub using **Noise Reduction** or **Equalization** effects to filter out frequencies that are more prominent in the dub than in the original. This is hit or miss and requires patience and experimentation. 4. **Recombine the edited audio** with the video using a video editing tool. # Professional Software Solutions Professional-grade software like Adobe Premiere Pro, Audacity (for audio), or DaVinci Resolve offers more sophisticated tools for audio editing and might give you more control over the process. These tools can sometimes identify and isolate spoken words or reduce background noise, but success heavily depends on the particular mix of the audio tracks. # Important Considerations - **Legal Issues**: Ensure that manipulating audio tracks is within legal rights for the content you're working with. - **Quality Loss**: Any manipulation of the audio can result in quality loss or noticeable artifacts, especially with complex mixes. If the original audio and the dubbed audio are deeply intertwined without clear channel separation, completely removing the dub without any trace might not be possible without access to the original, undubbed audio track."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
