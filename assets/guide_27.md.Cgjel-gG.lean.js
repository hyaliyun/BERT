A:","completion":"Yes, \\"benevolent\\" could be considered a valid answer to describe Casey in this scenario. To provide a more detailed explanation, let us examine the definition and context of the word \\"benevolent\\". Benevolence is typically characterized by kindness, goodwill, and a disposition to do good to others. It is a quality that can manifest itself in various forms, such as showing empathy, offering support, or expressing genuine concern for the well-being of others. In the given scenario, Casey pays Carson a compliment after noticing their new outfit. Compliments are generally perceived as kind gestures that express one's appreciation or admiration for another. By complimenting Carson on their outfit, Casey is acknowledging Carson's effort to look good and expressing their approval in a positive and friendly manner. This act of offering a compliment can be seen as an expression of goodwill and positivity towards Carson. While it is true that a single act of kindness might not be enough to establish someone's overall character as benevolent, it can still be reasonable to describe Casey as benevolent, at least in this specific context. It is important to note that people's personalities and behaviors can be multifaceted and complex. Using benevolent to describe Casey may be accurate in this particular case, but it is always good to keep in mind that people can exhibit various traits and behaviors in different situations.

Write an article based on this summary: Provide a heat source. Keep the temperature regulated. Provide a daily cycle of light and dark. Place the vivarium away from anything that will affect the temperature. Article:","completion":"Title: Creating the Perfect Environment for Your Reptile: A Comprehensive Guide to Temperature and Light Management in Vivariums Introduction Reptiles, as cold-blooded animals, rely heavily on their environment to control their body temperature, which is vital for their health and overall well-being. As pet owners, it is our responsibility to provide an environment that mimics their natural habitat as closely as possible. This article will discuss the importance of temperature and light management in a vivarium and provide practical tips for setting up the ideal living conditions for your reptile friend. 1. Choose the Right Heat Source The foundation of a healthy environment for reptiles is an appropriate heat source. The specific requirements may vary depending on the species; however, most reptiles need a temperature gradient within their enclosure to regulate their body temperature adequately. To achieve this, you may use the following types of heating devices: a) Heat lamps: These are one of the most commonly used heat sources for reptiles. They provide a basking spot, and the heat generated by the lamp can be easily adjusted if necessary. Ceramic heat emitters, infrared heat bulbs, and regular incandescent bulbs can be used for this purpose. b) Under-tank heating pads: These devices are placed beneath the vivarium to heat the substrate, which in turn heats the air. This type of heat source is beneficial for burrowing reptiles that rely on ground temperatures to thermoregulate. c) Heat rocks: While not recommended as the primary heat source, heat rocks can be useful for providing supplemental warmth, especially for reptiles requiring contact heat for digestion. 2. Monitor and Regulate Temperature Levels Once the desired temperature gradient is achieved, it is crucial to monitor and regulate the temperature regularly to ensure a stable environment. Inaccurate temperature control can lead to stress, illness, and even death in reptiles. Consider the following suggestions: a) Invest in a reliable thermometer: A high-quality digital thermometer accurately measures the temperature inside the vivarium. It's a good idea to place one probe on the cool side and another on the warm side to get a better understanding of the gradient. b) Use a thermostat: A thermostat can regulate the temperature by turning the heat source on or off. This not only helps maintain a consistent temperature but also saves energy. c) Check temperatures daily: Regular monitoring helps to detect any fluctuations in temperature early and allows for timely adjustments, if necessary. 3. Creating a Daily Cycle of Light and Dark The natural daily light cycle is essential for reptiles, as it helps regulate their sleep patterns, feeding habits, and overall behavior. Providing an appropriate cycle of light and dark is crucial to ensure the well-being of your pet. Consider the following tips: a) Set up a lighting schedule: This resembles the natural day and night cycle, typically consisting of 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness. b) Choose the right type of light: Full-spectrum UVA and UVB lights promote overall health and natural behaviors. However, avoid using heat-emitting lights as the sole source of light. Instead, use a combination of heat and light sources. c) Use a timer: Automatic timers make it easy to maintain a consistent daily light cycle and minimize the stress of manual intervention. 4. Positioning the Vivarium Lastly, it's essential to carefully consider the location where you place your vivarium. A suitable arrangement will help maintain consistent temperature and light conditions. Keep in mind the following advice: a) Avoid direct sunlight: Exposure to direct sunlight can cause overheating, leading to potential stress and health issues for your reptile. b) Keep away from drafts: Ensure that the vivarium is not close to windows, doors, or vents. Fluctuating air currents can negatively impact the temperature inside. c) Steer clear of heat sources: Position the vivarium away from heating devices, like radiators, which can increase temperature levels and lead to overheating. Conclusion Ensuring the ideal temperature and lighting conditions is an essential aspect of reptile husbandry. By investing in the appropriate equipment, monitoring the temperature, and adhering to recommended guidelines, you can create a safe and comfortable environment that closely mimics your reptile's natural habitat. This, in turn, will contribute to the health, happiness, and longevity of your cold-blooded friend."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Who announced the death of President Kennedy on American TV????","completion":"Walter Cronkite, a veteran and highly respected journalist, was the individual who announced the death of President John F. Kennedy on American television. At that time, Cronkite was serving as the lead anchor of CBS Evening News, a position he occupied from 1962 to 1981. The tragic news of President Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963, was an unforgettable moment in television history and was watched by millions of Americans who were glued to their television sets. On that fateful day, President Kennedy was in Dallas, Texas, participating in a motorcade through the city when shots were fired at him. The president was gravely wounded and was rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. The first bulletin reported by Walter Cronkite occurred at 1:40 PM, Eastern Standard Time, when CBS interrupted its regularly scheduled programming to deliver the breaking news that the President had been shot. Cronkite continued to provide viewers with updates throughout the afternoon, often using the ticker tape machine that was in the CBS newsroom as a primary source of information. The atmosphere in the newsroom, as well as across the nation, was one of shock and disbelief. At 2:38 PM, Eastern Standard Time, Cronkite received official confirmation from the Associated Press that President Kennedy had passed away. In a moment that has since become iconic, he removed his glasses and announced to the nation: \\"From Dallas, Texas, the flash, apparently official: 'President Kennedy died at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time.' 2 o'clock Eastern Standard Time, some 38 minutes ago.\\" Clearly emotional, Cronkite paused for a moment before continuing, \\"Vice President Lyndon Johnson has left the hospital in Dallas but we do not know to where he has proceeded; presumably, he will be taking the oath of office shortly and become the 36th President of the United States.” Walter Cronkite's coverage of the tragic event and the hours that followed serve as a testament to his professionalism in the face of intense pressure and emotion. His ability to deliver the news with accuracy and composure amid such shocking circumstances has forever cemented his place in broadcast journalism history. For many Americans, Cronkite's announcement of the death of President Kennedy remains a poignant memory from a tragic day in the nation's history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It has hair-like feelers sticking out of its rear which resemble the fuzzy hair of the colourful Troll Dolls, a popular toy in the 1990s. The 7mm-wide insect, pictured, was discovered after researchers from the University of Harvard trekked for three weeks to explore the untouched rainforest of southeast Suriname. The unnamed creature is covered in orange dots and stripes. Its feelers are made of wax that protrude from its rear end. Researchers believe the bug is an immature insect called a nymph, possibly fitting into one of four nymph families:. Dictyopharidae, Nogodinidae, Lophopidae, and Tropiduchidae. A nymph is an immature insect. In insects that undergo a gradual metamorphosis, the stage of the life cycle that hatches from the egg is called the nymph. These insects do not pupate like a butterfly. Often, the nymph looks like a smaller, wingless version of the adult. The nymph may molt several times to reach adulthood. Insects that undergo simple or gradual metamorphosis, and have a nymph stage, include grasshoppers and crickets, cockroaches, termites and dragonflies. Teams from the University of Harvard and. museums around the world trekked for three weeks to explore the. untouched rainforest of southeast Suriname. The new nymph was one of 60 new species recorded during the trek. Princeton's Dr Trond Larsen, who is a tropical ecologist and conservation biologist, spent days studying the creature.

In insects that undergo a gradual metamorphosis, the stage of the life cycle that hatches from the egg is called the nymph. These insects do not pupate like a butterfly. The iridescent 'tail' that grows from the bottom of some nymphs is in fact made of wax. It is produced by specialised glands in the abdomen.

Born in Southern Sudan, her idyllic childhood took a drastic turn as her native land was engulfed in a brutal civil war. Through sheer determination and an unwavering spirit, Wek has risen above the chaos that once surrounded her, becoming an internationally renowned model and philanthropist. This article takes a closer look at the remarkable journey of a woman who has not only defied the odds but has become an inspiration to millions. A Serene Start: Alek Wek's Early Years Born on April 16, 1977, in Wau, Sudan (now South Sudan), Alek Wek was the seventh of nine children in a loving, tight-knit family. Her father, Athian Wek, was an education minister, and her mother, Akuol Wek, was a stay-at-home mom. Her early years were marked by a peaceful and contented upbringing, surrounded by her siblings, who played together, attended the local school, and spent their free time savoring the natural beauty of their homeland. The Turmoil of War: Devastation in Southern Sudan However, the peaceful existence that Wek enjoyed in her early years quickly unraveled when the Second Sudanese Civil War broke out in 1983. This extremely violent and deadly conflict between the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army spanned over two decades and resulted in an estimated 2 million deaths and millions more displaced. For Wek and her family, the war hit close to home. Forced to flee their once-tranquil village, the family faced numerous challenges, including the heartbreaking loss of Wek's father due to complications from a hip replacement surgery. As the war raged on, Wek's family made the difficult decision to send her away to seek refuge in London, England, away from the horrors of the war. A New Life: From Refugee to Runway Arriving in London in 1991 at the age of 14, Alek Wek was able to live with her sister Aida and attend school, immersing herself in a new culture and experiences. What appeared to be another life-changing moment occurred in 1995 when a modeling scout discovered Wek at a South London park. Her striking beauty and unique features, which broke the mold of conventional European standards of beauty, caught the eye of the fashion world. Before long, Wek was signed to one of the top modeling agencies, and her career skyrocketed. In 1997, she became the first African model to appear on the cover of Elle magazine, a monumental achievement that challenged traditional norms and stereotypes in the fashion industry. Over the years, Wek has graced countless magazine covers, runways, and global fashion campaigns, working for prestigious designers such as Chanel, Calvin Klein, and Gucci. Philanthropy and Activism Alek Wek had not only conquered the fashion world but also used her platform to advocate for humanitarian issues. As a former refugee, she feels a deep connection to the plight of displaced populations and has worked tirelessly to raise awareness and contribute to their support. In 2002, she was named a Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and from that platform, she has shone a light on the critical issue of refugees, sharing her personal experiences with the world. Wek has also been involved with several other charitable organizations, such as World Vision, Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), and Save the Children.

It seems there is only one thing more irritating than the rotund opera singer from the Go Compare TV commercials – any attempt to do away with him. Two commercials where the character was attacked drew more complaints than any other to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) last year. The Italian character, Gio Compario, created by Welsh singer Wynne Evans, was designed to be deliberately annoying as he repeatedly blasted out the company jingle. Scroll down for videos. An ad showing Go Compare's opera-singing character Gio Compario being kicked in the stomach by Stuart Pearce generated over 1,000 complaints. Opera singer Gio Compario lies injured on the ground. Viewers complained the ad was potentially harmful to children. Stuart Pearce as he appears in the ad. Unsurprisingly, the price comparison website thought the nation would welcome a series of creative and funny efforts to wipe him off our TV screens. However, it appears many were upset by the dastardly comic book methods they came up with. The first commercial featured former England left back, Stuart Pearce, who is famous for his hefty left foot, aiming a football at the annoying Gio. More than 1,000 people complained that kicking a football into the singer’s stomach was likely to set a bad example to children. The ASA disagreed, insisting most people would understand it was light-hearted and comical. The second commercial saw Sue Barker, the BBC sports presenter and former tennis player, firing a rocket launcher at the character in a bid to kill him off. This time there were 797 complaints from people who were unhappy at the suggested violence. Again the ASA backed the company, saying the images were clearly meant to be a joke, while Gio was unharmed. The two commercials feature at the. top of a list of the ten most complained about advertisements of 2012 in. the watchdog’s annual report published today. In. third place was a more serious advertisement by Channel 4 for its. controversial series, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, which was deemed to have. sexualised a teenage girl. The poster showed the 15-year-old. blonde, who was heavily made up, spilling out of a low cut top that. revealed her breasts and cleavage. The. broadcaster was also criticised over a second poster of a 10-year-old. boy with an aggressive expression which was deemed to have stereotyped. youngsters from the traveller community. One commercial saw Sue Barker, the BBC sports presenter and former tennis player, firing a rocket launcher at the Go Compare character in a bid to kill him off. The watchdog’s annual report reveals that it rejected the vast majority of the 31,298 complaints received about 18,990 ads last year. Among those to be cleared were images of a naked rambler character in a TV ad for Richmond ham, which provoked complaints from more than 300 viewers that it was unsuitable to be seen by children. Asda came under fire last Christmas for a commercial that suggested the job of preparing for the festivities was essentially woman’s work. Women complained it promoted sexist stereotypes while men, including Fathers for Justice, were unhappy that it failed to recognise the value of dads. However, the ASA sided with the supermarket which produced research showing that mums really do carry the burden of organising Christmas. The organisation received more than 300 complaints about advertisements on the YouTube channel of the Paddy Power betting firm, which poked fun at transsexuals. It could not make a ruling as the firm is based in Ireland, however it did censure the firm over a similar commercial that appeared on British TV. Surprisingly, the St John’s Ambulance was responsible for one of the most controversial advertisements of the year. Its TV ad showed a man and his family coping with his diagnosis, treatment and eventual recovery from cancer, only for him to die by choking to death on a piece of food. More than 144 complained, however the ASA ruled the strong storyline was justified because it carried an important message that relatively simple first aid techniques can prevent a tragedy. Other commercials in the top ten, included a Morrisons ad where a dog was apparently being fed Christmas pudding, which might be harmful, and a Kellogg’s cereal ad which some thought was distressing because it showed a man being attacked by a snake. The ASA partly upheld complaints about a TV ad for the Kayak Software Corporation which showed a man receiving brain surgery. Some viewers thought the theme was distressing. The watchdog’s work led to just 3,700 ads being changed or withdrawn last year. Its chairman, Lord Smith, the former Labour Culture Secretary, said: ‘We want to make sure that consumers aren’t being misled, misinformed, harmed or offended. ‘They need to be able to make proper, informed choices about what products and services are available to them. And we want to make sure that there is a fair comparison between advertisers, so that responsible marketing isn’t being under-cut by the irresponsible.’ 1. Gocompare.com (1,008 complaints, not upheld)Stuart Pearce kicking a football into the stomach of an opera singer. 2. Gocompare.com (797 complaints, not upheld)Sue Barker shooting opera singer with rocket launcher. 3. Channel 4's Big Fat Gypsy Wedding (373 complaints, upheld in part)Poster sexualised girl of 15; poster showed aggressive young boy, stereotyped travellers. A poster advertising the forthcoming season of Channel 4's Big Fat Gypsy Wedding series generated 373 complaints due to the sexualised image of a 15-year-old girl. 4. Kerry Foods Richmond Ham, (371 complaints, upheld in part)Naked. rambler viewed as upsetting for children. Criticism of nudity rejected. Claim that meat was ‘Britain’s only ham’ was misleading. A naked rambler in a Kerry Foods ad for Richmond Ham was criticised for potentially upsetting children. 5. Paddy Power (Transsexual theme, 311 complaints, out of remit)Commercial on YouTube channel made fun of transsexuals. No ruling as company registered in Ireland. A Paddy Power ad with a transsexual theme angered viewers, who lodged over 300 complaints, but no ruling was made as the company is registered in Ireland. 6. Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut cereal (234 complaints, not upheld)Man attacked by snake as he tried to capture it in kitchen. A Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal ad generated 234 complaints by people who were alarmed by the sight of a snake attack on a man in his kitchen. 7. Morrisons (234 complaints, not upheld)Dog apparently being fed Christmas pudding, which could be harmful. A dog apparently being fed Christmas pudding in a Morrisons ad caused concern among animal lovers. 8. ASDA (620 complaints, not upheld)Mum seen doing all the hard work to prepare for Christmas. An Asda ad in which a mother is seen doing all the hard work to prepare for Christmas was deemed offensive by viewers. 9. Kayak Software (189 complaints, upheld in part)Brain surgery image deemed likely to cause distress to people who had been affected by this type of operation.10.

A retired family doctor killed himself after he wrongly convinced himself he had cancer, an inquest heard yesterday. Dr Philip Squire, 59, was found hanged at his home where he'd left a note saying he found 'the idea of operations and long suffering just unbearable'. But the inquest in Somerset was told how test results had given the GP the all clear and he had probably brought on the symptoms on himself physiologically. Tragedy: Doctor Philip Squire, 59, was found hanged at his home in Taunton, Somerset (stock image pictured), where he left a note saying his cancer was too much to bear despite being given the all-clear. His own GP, Doctor William Chandler, said the medic lived alone and suffered depression. He believed Dr Squire feared cancer rather than actually suffering from it. Neighbours found the retired GP in his home in Taunton, Somerset, where he left two notes. One of them read: 'My last 16 months have been hell, knowing something serious is happening but not being able to convince others. I have also felt rather alone and isolated. 'The idea of operations and suffering was just unbearable.' His niece Judith Sumner said he was 'conscientious and hard working' and retired in 2010 as senior partner because he was finding life as a GP 'very stressful' and suffered anxiety and low moods. West Somerset coroner Michael Rose recorded a verdict of suicide at the Taunton hearing. He said: 'Sadly he had a phobia about dying with cancer of the pancreas.

Which pond will the family most likely catch more fish, Ridge Pond or Happy Pond? Our family was going to go fishing on Saturday. A few years ago we went fishing down the hill from a mushroom farm called Happy Pond. Since that time, there has been a lot of rain and we noticed Happy Pond had a green coating across the top of it. We also thought about going to a new pond in center of the park called Ridge Pond. We are hoping to catch a lot of fish to serve at our family reunion. Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. The nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water bodies. Since there is a lot of nitrogen it causes algae to grow out of control. Figure below shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may use up so much oxygen in the water that nothing else can grow. Soon, even the algae die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. You can see it Figure below . Answer:","completion":"The family will most likely catch more fish at Ridge Pond. This is because Happy Pond has a green coating across the top of it, which is likely caused by an overgrowth of algae due to excess nitrogen in the water. The presence of a mushroom farm nearby and heavy rainfall could have led to fertilizer runoff into Happy Pond, causing this algal bloom. Algae can use up so much oxygen in the water that it creates a dead zone, leaving little to no oxygen for other aquatic organisms, including fish. On the other hand, Ridge Pond does not have any mentioned issues, making it a more suitable choice for the family to catch fish for their reunion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After decades of division in Cyprus, there is genuine belief a political solution will bring together Turkish Cypriots in the north and Greek Cypriots in the south. Since 1974, when a brief Athens-inspired coup was followed by a Turkish military invasion, the island has been cut in two, with the northern third controlled by Turkish Cypriots and the southern two-thirds by Greek Cypriots. So, why now? The catalyst for the negotiations was the election last April of the Turkish Cypriot President, Mustafa Akinci, who campaigned on a promise to broker a peace deal with the south. Negotiations between Mr Akinci and Nicos Anastasiades, the Greek Cypriot President of the island, began last May. It is fitting that the bulk of their talks are being held at Nicosia airport, a site that symbolises the stalemate in Cyprus. Abandoned during the conflict of 1974, it is now sandwiched in the UN buffer zone, frozen in time. The lonely shell of a Cyprus Airways passenger jet lies on the tarmac. The terminal, which opened in 1968, is now home only to nesting pigeons and the smell of damp. Advertising posters from 1974 remain fixed to walls. You could forgive the pessimism of Cypriots who shrug their shoulders when the prospect of a peace deal is raised. They have seen this before. In 2004, the UN's plan to make Cyprus a federation of two states was emphatically rejected by the public in a referendum. Twelve years later, there is a sense the political atmosphere has changed. A short stroll from the airport is the office of Aleem Siddique, the spokesman for the UN on the island. \\"One of the key reasons why people are a lot more optimistic this time around is the trust between the two leaders,\\" he tells me. The two presidents share much in common. They are a similar age, and both were born in the southern city of Limassol. In December, they delivered a joint TV address to wish residents a happy holiday and spoke of their hopes for a deal in 2016. In the centre of Nicosia, it's impossible to escape the reminders of the conflict. The UN buffer zone snakes through Europe's last divided capital. It is lined with derelict, crumbling buildings and endless spirals of barbed wire resting on oil drums. There is one place in the buffer zone where the atmosphere is much more welcoming. The Home for Cooperation, a community centre open to everybody on the island, hosts classes where people can learn Greek, Turkish and English. Language remains a big obstacle to integration in Cyprus. Yaprak Aydin, who lives in the Turkish-controlled north, says the centre is also about people coming together and developing empathy for those not from their own community. She smiles as she recalls a story of a Greek Cypriot lady who got in touch with the centre to tell them she had met her best friend in their cafe. The friend was Turkish Cypriot. \\"Never underestimate the power of a cup of coffee, especially in Cyprus,\\" Ms Aydin tells me. Despite the sense of hope, there remain big obstacles to overcome. During the conflict, tens of thousands of people were displaced from their homes. The delicate question remains what happens if the island unites. Is the property returned or will the owners compensated? And from where would the money come? Security is a further complication. For many Greek Cypriots, the departure of Turkish troops from the island is non-negotiable. For some Turkish Cypriots though, the Turkish military presence provides reassurance. However, following the financial crisis on the island in 2013, there was recognition a solution could reap economic dividends, with trade routes opened up to Turkey. For Mr Siddique, though, Cypriots should consider not only the economic benefits, but the international example that would be set in the region. \\"The symbolism of a largely Muslim Turkish Cypriot community and a largely Christian Greek Cypriot community coming together would send such a strong signal across the world,\\" he says. Summary:","completion":"The decades-long division in Cyprus between the Turkish Cypriots in the north and Greek Cypriots in the south could finally be nearing a political solution, offering hope for reunification, peace, and potential economic benefits for the island."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Beauregard?, using the article: H. L. Hunley takes his ship, the H.L. Hunley, out in the Charleston, South Carolina harbor and it sinks with all hands. As the blockade still needs to be broken, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard has the ship raised and puts George E. Dixon in charge. He starts looking for a crew and after some difficulty finally finds enough volunteers to man it. They practice cranking the propeller. The crew do not all get along with each other. Dixon flashes back to the Battle of Shiloh, where a gold coin given to him by his wife (who was later killed in a steamboat explosion caused by a drifting mine) deflected a bullet and saved his life. They take the ship down and sit on the bottom to see how long they can stay down and almost get stuck. The U.S. Navy is warned about the sub. The crew votes that if after an attack they are stuck on the bottom, they will open the valves, flooding the ship, rather than suffocate. They go out to attack the USS Wabash, but the attack fails. Following the warning the ship has draped metal chain netting over the side. Also the rope which was attached to the torpedo they were to release under the ship gets loose and becomes entangled in the propeller. It has to be cut loose while sailors on the Wabash shoot at the Hunley. Beauregard proposes putting the torpedo at the end of a long spar. The USS Housatonic is ordered to change its position in the harbor and always be ready to steam, meaning it cannot hang metal netting over the side. The Hunley's second in command, Lt. Alexander, is ordered to Mobile, Alabama, and a young soldier who had been volunteering to join the crew is allowed to do so., what would be the answer ?

News article: Other than Diamond Stone, Terps have not gotten much from bench When Maryland guard Melo Trimble picked up his second foul midway through the first half of Tuesday night’s 70-67 loss to Michigan, Coach Mark Turgeon looked down his bench and pondered the mix of talented reserves he has trumpeted since the summer. He tinkered with his lineups all evening to neutralize his team’s foul trouble and the Wolverines’ relentless attack, attempting to create depth instead of relying on it. He inserted 6-foot-7 small forward Jared Nickens at shooting guard for a stretch. He relied on 5-7 reserve Varun Ram, normally a situational defensive specialist, to spell Trimble for 14 minutes. He paired Ram and backup point guard Jaylen Brantley at one point and rotated a front-court lineup that featured another sensational outing from freshman center Diamond Stone. Despite his team’s first loss in six weeks, Turgeon is confident that he has expanded his options as No. 3 Maryland (15-2, 4-1) prepares to host Ohio State on Saturday. “I think we built depth the other night. We didn’t win the game, but we built depth. We had to overcome a little foul trouble to do that,” he said Friday. [LeDay’s surprise emergence bolsters Hokies’ rebuilding job] The chief option in reserve is Stone, who is averaging 16.8 points over his past 10 games — coming off the bench in nine of those contests — and has quickly become the most dominant sixth man in the country. But his surge underscores the recent offensive struggles of Maryland’s second unit. Against Michigan, all of the bench’s 22 points and 11 rebounds were compiled by Stone. Excluding Maryland’s blowout win over Rutgers earlier this month — when the freshman center inadvertently started because an error was made in the scorebook and the bench was emptied early with the Terps’ lead ballooning to 42 points — Stone has scored 82 of the bench’s 87 points in four conference games. He also has collected 30 of the 40 rebounds among the reserves over that stretch. Turgeon will stick with his usual starting lineup for Saturday’s game against the Buckeyes (12-6, 4-1) , who have won eight of nine, which means he will continue to bring Stone off the bench behind junior center Damonte Dodd. While Stone is playing starter’s minutes and has emerged as the centerpiece in the front court, Turgeon said earlier this month that he needs more production out of Dodd and sophomore center Michal Cekovsky. Cekovsky has logged 32 minutes in five conference games and posted one point and seven rebounds over that stretch. [Which Pac-12 team will capi­tal­ize on Arizona’s bad luck?] Nickens, considered the best three-point shooter on the team, has been held scoreless in each of the past two games and three of the past five. Brantley, who made considerable strides near the end of the nonconference season, played 15 minutes against Rutgers after Trimble went down with a hamstring injury but has since logged just one minute in the past two games as Turgeon has turned to Ram. “I’m going to coach by feel,” Turgeon said. “Jared didn’t make shots, but Jared played pretty well. Defensively, I thought he did a really nice job. I thought Varun really helped us. I think it was a breath of fresh air.” Ram made several key defensive plays to keep Maryland close Tuesday night, but he also found himself open for two three-pointers in the second half. He missed both, admitting Friday that he wasn’t mentally prepared enough to knock them down. It can be difficult for a reserve such as Ram to find an offensive identity off the bench, given the amount of scoring firepower already available on the roster. Turgeon has said that playing time among his reserve guards is often dictated by their skills and the situation at hand — Brantley can stretch the floor with his shooting ability, while Ram is one of the team’s best perimeter defenders. But Ram added that the offense can’t play “four on five” when he’s on the floor. “When you’re on the floor with all these future NBA players, you want to make sure they’re the ones shooting the ball,” the senior said. “At the same time, you have to be ready to take an open shot.” Turgeon vowed earlier this season not to talk about the impact that sophomore Dion Wiley’s season-ending knee injury would have on his team, but it clearly has affected his depth at times. But while Turgeon can do nothing about Wiley’s absence, he is still carrying unflinching trust in the offensive capabilities of his bench. The more significant growth of the second team has come on the defensive end, including for Stone, who had the furthest ground to make up of any player on the roster. “We all feel comfortable with who we’re playing,” Turgeon said. “We just have to play a little bit better.” Roman Stubbs covers the University of Maryland athletics for The Washington Post.

Maryland's bench excluding Stone has only scored 5 points in the last four conference games, with Stone scoring 82 of the bench's 87 points.

Please write a short summary for the following article: PARENTS' GUIDE TO VISITING DAY AT CAMP THERE is a short but special season of the year that fits neatly between the beginning of July and the end of August. It is the time when parents of children away at summer camp have finally adjusted to tiny loads of laundry, sinfully small grocery bills and plenty of peace and quiet, and it precedes the period when they start dashing off to concert halls, R-rated movies, getaway weekends for two and other ''adult'' activities - before the kids come home. By the middle of summer, the family dog has reluctantly left his post at the kitchen door, having given up hope of seeing his favorite people trooping in at 3 o'clock. Even the family car has accepted the new routine; it has stopped turning automatically onto its old routes - the roads to school, the orthodontist, barbershop, soccer field, dancing lessons and birthday parties. It now knows the way to art museums, antique shows and Japanese restaurants that specialize in sushi. And it appreciates taking a nice, relaxing drive without having its back seat battered by juvenile wrestling and rioting. At this special time, when the eight weeks of summer camp so beautifully balance - four weeks gone and four more weeks to go - parents jump into cars, planes, trains and buses and run off to the country, eager to be the first adults their children will see at camp on Visiting Day. The kids are encouraged by the camping staff to play catch, clean their bunks or ''just play quietly'' while waiting for Visiting Day to begin, but soon after breakfast, they all start drifting toward the main gate. A glimpse of one's parents - or the parents of a friend - can give instant status to someone with sharp eyes. Many things should be considered by parents as they make their way from the parking lot, lugging lawn chairs, blankets and shopping bags filled with ''goodies.'' The following information is presented as a guide to these parents: 1. Be prepared for some changes in your child's appearance. Do not cry, ''Good grief! They're starving you! You must have lost at least 10 pounds!'' Even if your daughter (on whom you have spent close to 2,000 for this summer in the sun) looks like an inner-city advertisement for ''send this poor child to camp,'' don't admit it in front of her. Also, don't comment on other peculiarities; try to ignore tattoo marks (they'll probably wash right off with nail polish remover), experimental hair-dos and recently pierced ears. 2. Remember, you are at camp only for one day. Control the urge to speak your mind. Lay off the scolding. Do not say, ''You needn't call home collect every time you get a stomach ache. This camp has two competent nurses,'' even if you're bursting to do so. Within a week, you'll be swearing they have acute appendicitis and are afraid to let you - or anybody else -know. Do say, ''Things are very quiet at home. Most of the time we just sit around the house and say how glad we are that you're out of the hot city.'' 3. When you visit your child's cabin, studiously avoid any close examination of his or her toilet kit. The toothpaste, soap and shampoo you assiduously purchased in June may still be unwrapped. Furthermore, delving into a dirt-encrusted clothes cubby might excite a field mouse or other country creature that may have made a home for itself in some warm, wet socks. 4. If you must take food, don't take anything perishable. Aunt Helen's chopped liver may be a family treat at home, but it will quickly turn to moldy paste in summer heat. If you buy candy or other snack items, don't buy more than the amount your child will be able to stuff into his or her mouth that night. It is an unwritten custom among campers to gorge themselves on as many food treats as possible within 24 hours after Visiting Day. 5. Do not attempt to give your son a midsummer haircut. He probably thinks he was already scalped in June and his hair is just beginning to ''grow in.'' Also, do not tell him his kid sister stuck her hands into his fish tank ''just to pet them, Mommy,'' and three swordtails died from shock. The bad news can wait until he comes home from camp. 6. You may have received one or two frantic letters written the week before Visiting Day, with outrageous requests such as ''please bring the dog. We can smuggle her into my bunk during General Swim,'' and ''You've got to get me out of here! This is the third night I've had to sleep under the bunk!'' Don't let these pleas get to you on Visiting Day. It's normal to expect some dissatisfactions. One mother spent an entire visit listening to a litany of complaints from her 10-year old daughter. The food was horrid. The other kids hated her. The camp director was always yelling and the head waterfront counselor had threatened to drown her if she didn't master the Australian crawl. By the end of the day, the mother was reduced to jelly. Wondering if she should tell the child to hurry and pack her bags, she tremblingly hugged her and kissed her on the cheek. Before she could speak, her daughter was off, running down the camp trail back to her bunk. Over her shoulder, she called, ''when I come back next year, I want to be in Bunk 8!'' 7. Do not bring any treasured possessions from home. You will immediately hear, ''Let me see it, let me see it,'' from his bunkmates, and the next words may regretfully be, ''Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to break it...'' 8. Be sure to wear comfortable, closed-toe shoes. One mother wearing high-heeled pumps speared as much grass and litter with her stiletto spikes as an overzealous sanitation worker in Central Park. One father, all decked out in new, imported sandals, spent half the car ride home picking gravel and tar off the soles of his feet. 9. Do not leave the camp grounds, especially if you're not familiar with the territory. At one camp in Massachusetts, picnic lunches were offered to campers and their families. A 12-year-old boy invited his folks to eat with him at a ''special place'' he had discovered in the woods. ''Look at the grass,'' he told them, ''it's so warm and moss-like.'' They spread his jelly-roll blanket down on the ground and rubbed their hands on the soft, furry surface. Lunch was eaten and while everyone was relaxing, the head counselor appeared. ''Hi,'' he said, and then he paused nervously. They could tell bad news was coming. ''I hate to tell you this,'' he fidgeted, ''but you're sitting on top of the camp cesspool.'' 10. At departure time, don't be surprised if, having seen what all the other parents brought their children, your child has made a new list of ''must-haves'' for you to send by mail. 11. Make your goodbyes short. Nobody likes to pry his own kid's fingers off the car fender, or shut the car door on a forlorn face. One family drove three miles before they discovered what the ''extra weight'' was in the trunk. Your best bet is to leave a half-hour before Visiting Day concludes, so you and your kids aren't stimulated by the tearful separations around you. Besides, by leaving early you'll beat the other parents back to the city and have more time to enjoy your remaining weeks alone! --------------------------------------------------------------------- Susan J.

Daniel Willingham: The false promise of brain game apps Who wouldn’t like to be smarter? According to several software companies, it’s not that hard. Just load their apps on your phone and play them regularly. The games challenge your memory and attention and thereby strengthen the mind, just like exercise strengthens a muscle — or so they promise. A new review of the evidence, however, concludes they don’t work. Here’s the basic premise: When you practice something (say, math), you not only improve on the task, you improve on more general mental abilities. This was how educators used to justify having students study Latin. Sure, the language is dead, but studying it will improve memory and make kids think more logically. But when researchers put this idea to the test, they found it didn’t work. While practice makes you better at the specific task, it doesn’t improve a broader mental ability. In a dramatic example from the 1970s, a few students practiced remembering strings of random digits. They got to be very good, remembering upwards of 70 digits at a crack. But when asked to remember letters, they could remember fewer than 10, about the same as before training. Practice improved only the specific task, not more general mental abilities. In 2008, a new experiment cast doubt on this conclusion. Researchers at the University of Michigan trained subjects on a working memory task. Working memory refers to your ability to juggle information in your mind, as when you try to calculate 36 x 16 in your head. The researchers found that people who practiced working memory tasks were better at other working memory tasks. A fist full of diodes: 'Westworld' comes to HBO That tantalizing study hinted that perhaps researchers had been too hasty in concluding we can’t train the brain. A steady stream of research followed, with many studies seemingly supporting brain training, but some — especially those done with extra care — casting doubt on the findings. The stream of research ran parallel with a torrent of commercial brain games making big promises. Did they overpromise? A new review of 375 scientific studies, conducted by a team of seven researchers unaffiliated with any of the companies, concluded there’s no evidence brain games work. Crucially, many of the reviewed studies failed to account for the placebo effect. That’s where people feel less pain after taking a sugar pill; the mere expectation of relief provides some relief. The same thing happens with brain training. When people know that the games they are playing are supposed to make them smarter, they do a little better on the final test — but only because they focus attention and try a little harder, not because they have gotten smarter. A study published earlier this year offered a dramatic example of this placebo effect. Researchers posted fliers around a college campus. All the fliers offered a chance to participate in a research study, but some listed the subject as “Brain Training & Cognitive Enhancement,” whereas others didn’t mention the purpose. Everyone played brain games for an hour, too short for any possible benefit. Yet the people who thought they were in a study of brain training showed improvement at the end of the hour. The people who had completed identical training but did not expect to improve didn’t. Mandated train control tech could've stopped NJ Transit wreck This was the fatal flaw of most experiments: They didn’t account for people’s expectations. In the few studies done the right way (or close to it), the researchers found that people always get better at the task they practice and sometimes get somewhat better at similar tasks. But there’s no evidence of an across-the-board increase in smarts from brain games. So what should you tell your elderly father who worries that he’s thinking a little slower? Staying mentally active is always a good idea, and if they enjoy the games, playing them can’t hurt. But simple tasks that make you smarter remain a hope, not a reality. Willingham is a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. The basic premise of brain game apps is that practicing specific tasks will improve general mental abilities. 2. Previous research has shown that practicing specific tasks only improves that task, and not broader mental abilities. 3. In 2008, a study found that practice in working memory tasks led to improvements in other working memory tasks, suggesting potential for brain training. 4. A new review of 375 scientific studies found no evidence that brain games work, with most studies failing to account for the placebo effect. 5. When conducted correctly, studies show that people improve in the specific tasks they practice, but there is no evidence of an overall increase in intelligence from brain games."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He defeated Peter Gruenstein with 62.5% of the vote in 1988 and then faced John Devens, the Mayor of Valdez, Alaska, in 1990 and 1992. Young defeated him by 99,003 votes (51.66%) to 91,677 (47.84%) in 1990 and then faced a serious challenge in 1992. He was challenged in the Republican primary by State Senator Virginia M. Collins and defeated her by 24,869 votes (52.98%) to 19,774 (42.12%). In the general election, he was re-elected against Devens by 111,849 votes (46.78%) to 102,378 (42.82%).

Did more people vote in the 1984 general election or the 1992 general election?","completion":"To find out if more people voted in the 1984 general election or the 1992 general election, we need to compare the total number of votes cast in both elections. In the 1984 general election, the total votes were 113,582 (55.02%) for the winner and 86,052 (41.68%) for Pegge Begich, which sums up to: 113,582 + 86,052 = 199,634 votes.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the process that involves sweat changing into a gas, heat being drawn from the sweat, and the body being cooled through the process of evaporation is known as sweating and the ensuing evaporation. This process plays a significant role in thermoregulation, ensuring that our body maintains a stable internal temperature. To fully understand the entire process, let's break it down into individual steps: 1. Production of sweat: The process begins with the production of sweat by sweat glands, primarily eccrine glands, which are distributed all over the body. Sweat glands are stimulated by the hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible for regulating body temperature, particularly when the body's internal temperature begins to rise (due to external factors like heat, exercise, or fever). The sympathetic nervous system activates the sweat glands to produce sweat, which is mostly composed of water, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and chloride), and trace amounts of other compounds such as lactate and urea. 2. Secretion of sweat: Once produced, the sweat is secreted onto the surface of the skin. At this point, sweat is in its liquid form and is capable of absorbing excess heat from the body. The secretion of sweat is a continuous process as the body attempts to maintain a constant internal temperature, and the rate of sweating can be influenced by various factors such as humidity, air movement, level of physical activity, and individual differences. 3. Evaporation of sweat: The first step explicitly asked for in the question refers to the actual process of the sweat evaporating from the surface of the skin. The liquid sweat comes into contact with the surrounding air and turns into a gas through endothermic evaporation, a physical process that requires heat. The heat necessary for this process is drawn from the body and absorbed by the sweat, thus cooling the body down. 4. Cooling effect: As heat is drawn from the body into the evaporating sweat, this lowers the overall body temperature, leading to a sensation of cooling. The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body, further contributing to the cooling effect. In summary, the first step of the process, as requested in the question, is the evaporation of sweat from the body's surface. This step is part of a broader process that begins with the production and secretion of sweat by the sweat glands, followed by the evaporation of sweat and the cooling effect it has on the body, all of which work together to maintain an ideal internal body temperature."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Instead of saying \\"he looked like a vampire,\\" I'd like to say something like \\"he looked [vampiric].\\" I actually just found out vampiric was a word, but I want something that sounds better (more colloquial/natural, I suppose) and covers a variety of traits (pale, emaciated, sickly, etc). Why I don't just use \\"vampiric\\": As @chepner commented: I think the idea is to find a word that isn't so \\"circular\\", and doesn't refer explicitly to vampires or require knowledge of vampires in context. If someone were to ask \\"What does a vampire look like?\\", then \\"It looks vampiric/vampirish\\" wouldn't be terribly helpful. I don't want to explicitly refer to drug addicts as vampires.

It was very late at night and the station was full of people. They were waiting to buy tickets of the last train. He bought the last ticket, and he was very happy. At that time, a woman with a crying baby walked to him and asked him to sell her the ticket. He gave her the ticket because he thought they needed it more than he did.

Rabbits that are not spayed or neutered are far more likely to become aggressive when they become mature, usually around 3-9 months of age. Getting your rabbit spayed or neutered could drastically improve its behavioral issues. Some rabbit owners might think that breeding their female rabbit will have the same effect on her behavior as having her spayed. This isn’t true. Breeding your female rabbit isn’t an alternative to having her spayed. Any change that might appear in her behavior while she’s pregnant is only temporary, and those aggressive traits will reappear after she has given birth. Aggression or viciousness might come about as a response to being in pain or being ill, so if your bunny shows this type of behavior—especially if it is sudden—make sure you get it to the vet to make sure it isn’t suffering from any kind of ailment or injury. At the vet, make sure you ask about your bunny’s overall health. Ask about ways you might work to correct the bad behavior, and see if your vet has any suggestions or advice pertaining to your particular rabbit. If the vet says anything you aren’t clear about, ask questions, and get the information you need. You can do a quick check of your own at home before seeing a vet. Some signs of sickness might be runny eyes or nose, a spike in or lowering of body temperature (best felt through touching their ears), or even a loss of appetite. Any of these could be signs of a problem, so take your bunny to the vet if it displays any or some combination of them. Avoid trying to pull your rabbit out of his cage. Don’t take out its toys, food bowls, or anything else from its cage while it’s in it. Wait until it isn’t in its cage to clean it. If your rabbit bites you when you are reaching into its cage, it is likely being protective. The best thing to do when reaching into your rabbit’s cage is to reach in just to pet it. Give your rabbit a little affectionate rub each time you reach in. Then, your rabbit will eventually learn that the hand reaching into the cage isn’t a threat, but rather something positive. Summary:","completion":"Rabbits can be aggressive due to hormones, and spaying or neutering can help improve behavior, but make sure to check their health and be gentle when interacting with them in their cage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - No Policy is the only studio release by the American hardcore punk band State of Alert, the first band to be fronted by Henry Rollins. It was released on 7-inch vinyl in March 1981 through Dischord Records (No. 2). Since Dischord was tied up in releasing Minor Threat's debut EP, the production of \\"No Policy\\" was funded entirely by Rollins. - Dischord Records is a Washington, D.C.-based independent record label specializing in the independent punk rock music of the D.C.-area music scene. The label is co-owned by Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, who founded Dischord in 1980 to release \\"Minor Disturbance\\" by The Teen Idles. Along with other independent American labels such as Twin/Tone, Touch and Go Records, and SST Records, Dischord helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging. - Straight edge (sometimes abbreviated sXe or signified XXX or X) is a subculture of hardcore punk whose adherents refrain from using alcohol, tobacco and other recreational drugs, in reaction to the excesses of punk subculture. For some, this extends to refraining from engaging in promiscuous sex, following a vegetarian or vegan diet, and/or not using caffeine or prescription drugs. The term \\"straight edge\\" was adopted from the 1981 song \\"Straight Edge\\" by the hardcore punk band Minor Threat. - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network. - The Teen Idles were an American hardcore punk band formed in Washington, D.C. in September 1979. Consisting of teenagers Nathan Strejcek, Geordie Grindle, Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, the Idles' recorded two demo sessions and the 1980 \\"Minor Disturbance\\" EP before they broke up in November 1980. The influential independent record label Dischord Records was originally created with the sole purpose of releasing the Teen Idles 7\\" record. They were an early landmark in the D.C. hardcore movement, and MacKaye and Nelson would later form the seminal punk outfit Minor Threat. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - State of Alert (often abbreviated to S.O.A.) was an American hardcore punk group formed in Washington, D.C. in October 1980, and disbanded in July 1981. The group was formed after the members' of previous group, The Extorts, lost its vocalist Lyle Preslar and hired Henry Rollins, then known by his birth name Henry Garfield. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music. - Henry Rollins (born Henry Lawrence Garfield; February 13, 1961) is an American musician, actor, writer, television and radio host, and comedian. He hosts a weekly radio show on KCRW, and is a regular columnist for \\"LA Weekly\\" and \\"Rolling Stone Australia\\". - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - String instruments, stringed instruments, or chordophones are musical instruments that produce sound from vibrating strings when the performer plays or sounds the strings in some manner. - Minor Disturbance is the only studio release by the American hardcore punk band The Teen Idles. It was released in December 1980 through Dischord Records (No. 1). Comprising eight songs, \\"Minor Disturbance\\" referenced a number of issues pertinent to the band, from being turned away at local concerts due to their age (\\"Too Young to Rock\\") to what they felt was the increasing complacency of many first wave punk bands (\\"Fleeting Fury\\"). Upon its release, \\"Minor Disturbance\\", Dischord Records' first release, received positive reviews from local fanzines and gained airplay on local radio stations. - SST Records is an American independent record label formed in 1978 in Long Beach, California by musician Greg Ginn. The company was initially formed in 1966 by Ginn at age 12, as Solid State Tuners, a small business through which he sold electronics equipment. Ginn repurposed the company as a record label to release material by his band Black Flag. - Southern California, often abbreviated as SoCal, is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises California's 10 southernmost counties. The region is traditionally described as eight counties, based on demographics and economic ties: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. The more extensive 10-county definition, which includes Kern and San Luis Obispo counties, is also used based on historical political divisions. Southern California is a major economic center for the state of California and the United States. - Lyle Preslar is an American musician best known for being the guitar player and songwriter for the hardcore punk band Minor Threat . Before that , he was the vocalist for The Extorts , whom later became State of Alert after he quit .

This is because the unbroken skin covering the blister forms a protective shield which prevents infection. After a couple of days, the body will reabsorb the fluid inside the blister (known as serum) and the blister will disappear. This is the best option if the blister is not causing you any pain, as it minimizes the risk of infection. If the blister is on your hand or somewhere it will not be exposed to further friction, you can leave it uncovered as the air will help it to heal. If it is on your foot, you may want to cover it with a gauze or moleskin pad, which will protect the blister but also allow it to breathe. If the blister bursts on its own, allow the fluid to drain, clean the area well, then cover in a dry, sterile bandage until it heals. This will heal to prevent infection. Although doctors recommend that you avoid bursting a blister if at all possible, in some scenarios it is necessary to drain a blister, especially if is causing a lot of pain or pressure. For instance, competitive runners may need to drain a large blister on the sole of their foot if they have a race coming up. If you need to drain a blister, it is very important that you follow the correct procedure in order to avoid infection. The first thing you need to do is clean the skin on and around the blister using warm water and soap. Any soap will do, but antibacterial soap is best. This will help to remove any sweat or dirt from the area before you proceed with the draining. Take a clean, sharp needle and sterilize it using one of the following methods: wipe it down with some rubbing alcohol; scald it with boiling water; hold it over an open flame until it glows orange. Use the sterilized needle to puncture the blister in several spots around the edges. Use a clean piece of gauze or tissue to gently compress the blister, allowing the fluid to drain. Do not remove the loose skin covering the blister, as this will help to protect it. Once all of the fluid has drained, dab a little antibacterial ointment or cream on the blister. Any over-the-counter antibacterial product will do, like Neosporin, Polymyxin B or Bacitracin. The ointment will help to kill any bacteria around the blister and fight off infection, while also preventing the bandage from sticking to the loose skin. After you have applied the ointment, cover the drained blister with some gauze padding or a gel-based plaster. These will prevent any dirt or bacteria from entering the open blister, and also provide some comfort when walking or running if the blister is on the foot. You should apply a new plaster every day, especially if the existing plaster becomes wet or dirty. After two or three days, remove the bandage and use sterilized scissors to cut away any loose, dead skin. Don't attempt to peel away any skin that is still attached, however. Clean the area again, apply more ointment and cover with a clean bandage. The blister should be completely healed within three to seven days. In some cases, an infection will develop despite your best efforts to avoid one. If this is the case, you should see your doctor immediately. S/he may prescribe a strong topical antibiotic or an oral antibiotic to clear the infection. Signs of infection include skin redness and swelling around the blister, a build-up of pus, red streaks on the skin and fever.

This includes, but is not limited to, service of process (SOP) such as lawsuits or summons, government correspondence, compliance notifications, and other official notifications. In many jurisdictions, having a registered agent is mandated by law for every LLC, corporation, or business entity registered within the state. The registered agent must have a physical address in the state where the business is operating and must be available during regular business hours. A business owner can either designate themselves, a trusted individual, or engage a professional registered agent service to fulfill this role. It's essential to choose a competent and reliable registered agent to ensure timely communication and compliance with state regulations. The importance of having a registered agent cannot be overstated, as they serve as a liaison between the business and the state government. They facilitate effective communication and help the business maintain good standing by receiving and forwarding important legal documents and ensuring that deadlines are adhered to, such as annual report submissions and tax payments. In summary, a registered agent is an essential part of any LLC or business entity in the United States. Their primary role is to act as the official representative for receiving service of process and other critical legal and tax documents on behalf of the business. They ensure smooth communication between the company and government authorities, helping maintain compliance and good standing within the state. So, it is crucial for business owners to appoint a dependable and responsible registered agent to help protect their company's reputation and operations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - GTM Cars is a component kit car manufacturer located in Kingswinford, UK. - A kit car, also known as a component car, is an automobile that is available as a set of parts that a manufacturer sells and the buyer then assembles into a functioning car. Usually, many of the major mechanical systems such as the engine and transmission are sourced from donor vehicles or purchased new from other vendors. Kits vary in completeness, consisting of as little as a book of plans, or as much as a complete set with all components included. - An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy. Heat engines burn a fuel to create heat, which then creates a force. Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion; pneumatic motors use compressed air and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy. In biological systems, molecular motors, like myosins in muscles, use chemical energy to create forces and eventually motion. - Kingswinford is a suburban area of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley, in the West Midlands, England.

Here is a hypothesis: Many of these products are sold in department stores. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the given premise and hypothesis, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. The premise and the hypothesis are related to different subjects and do not have a clear logical connection. To analyze the premise and hypothesis, let's break them down: Premise: Cpk values (Process Capability Indices) have an additive effect on various individual parts when each part is integrated into the final product. This statement is related to the field of process and quality control in manufacturing, specifically how Cpk values help assess the capability of a manufacturing process to achieve desired quality levels for each individual part. The higher the Cpk value, the better the quality performance of the process in question. Hypothesis: Many of these products are sold in department stores. This statement is related to the retail and marketing aspect of products, and it concerns the sales and distribution channels through which the products are made available to consumers, such as department stores. Although both the premise and hypothesis involve products, their connection to each other is not evident or logically sound. The premise is primarily concerned with the manufacturing process and quality control, while the hypothesis deals with sales and distribution. Ultimately, the sale of products in department stores typically depends on factors separate from the manufacturing process and Cpk values, such as market demand, branding, pricing, and a variety of other factors that influence consumer behavior. If the premise is true, it might imply that the final product has a higher level of quality. However, a connection between the manufacturing process's Cpk values and the sales of the product in a specific retail outlet like a department store cannot be established with certainty based solely on the premise's truth. In conclusion, the truth of the premise does not guarantee nor provide sufficient evidence for the truth of the hypothesis. The two statements concern different aspects of a product's lifecycle and do not hold a direct logical connection that would allow one to derive the latter's truth from the former."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This year thee comets would be of interest, comet A, comet B, and comet C. Comet A and comet B would enter the inner solar system. But comet C would not enter the inner solar system. Moreover, comet A is categorized as a bright comet, but comet B is categorized as a faint comet. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which comet's dust would not reflect sunlight, comet A or comet C? Hint: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, comet C would not enter the inner solar system. Since a comet tail and coma only become visible when a comet is illuminated by the Sun as it passes through the inner Solar System, comet C's dust would not have the chance to reflect sunlight.

Use the formula P=4x{displaystyle P=4x} to find the perimeter of a square. Find the perimeter given other information.","completion":"Title: Understanding the Perimeter of a Rectangle and a Square: Formulas and Applications Introduction: Geometry plays a significant role in our daily lives, from designing artistic patterns to planning construction projects. At the core of these applications lie fundamental geometrical shapes such as rectangles and squares. Understanding the properties and formulas related to these shapes is crucial for practical applications. In this article, we will discuss how to set up the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, use the perimeter formula to find the perimeter of a square, and explore ways to find the perimeter given other information. Setting up the Formula for the Perimeter of a Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles and opposite sides equal in length. The two dimensions of a rectangle are referred to as its width (w) and height (h), also known as its length (l). The perimeter of any geometrical shape is defined as the total distance around the shape. For a rectangle, we can calculate the perimeter by adding the lengths of all four sides. To set up the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, we first consider its dimensions (width and height). Mathematically, we can write the formula as: P = 2w + 2h Where: P = Perimeter of the rectangle w = Width of the rectangle h = Height (or length) of the rectangle Alternatively, the formula can be written as: P = 2(w + h) In this form, it emphasizes that we sum the width and height and then multiply by 2. Using the Formula to Find the Perimeter of a Square: A square is a special type of rectangle where all four sides are equal in length. Therefore, the width and the height of a square are both equal to its side length (s). To find the perimeter of a square, we can use the perimeter formula for a rectangle. Using the alternative form of the rectangle's perimeter formula (P = 2(w + h)), we can substitute w and h with s, the side length of the square. This results in the formula: P = 2s + 2s Simplifying this formula, we get: P = 4s Where: P = Perimeter of the square s = Side length of the square Finding the Perimeter Given Other Information: There may be cases where we are provided with different sets of information and are required to find the perimeter. For example, we may be given the area of a rectangle, and one of its side lengths, but not the other side. In such a case, we can leverage existing knowledge of the shape's properties to find the missing information. For instance, the area of a rectangle is given by: Area = w × h If we know the area and one of the sides (either width or height), we can solve for the other side using the formula. Once both dimensions are established, we can plug in the values into the perimeter formula (P = 2w + 2h) to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. Conclusion: Geometry and its formulas are essential tools for understanding and manipulating the world around us. The perimeter of a rectangle (P = 2w + 2h) and a square (P = 4s) serve as crucial parameters in a myriad of applications in design, construction, and various other fields. By gaining a deeper understanding of these formulas, we can enhance our ability to work with geometrical shapes and solve real-world problems."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

They are classified into different categories based on their temperature, mass, and brightness. Stars' temperature and brightness are related: hotter stars tend to be brighter, and cooler stars are generally less bright. The cooler stars are less bright because they have lower temperatures and emit less energy. The question states that a main sequence star that is very bright is not among the coolest stars, which implies that in order to be very bright, the star must have a higher temperature than the coolest stars in the main sequence. This is because the emitted energy (brightness) is directly related to the temperature of the star. So, higher temperature stars will be brighter than cooler stars in the main sequence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The context provided does not contain any information about Gordon Campbell's past or current career in professional hockey. Gordon Campbell is referred to as the 'premier of British Columbia, Canada,' in this context, implying that he is a political figure, but no evidence points to him having been a professional hockey player. In real-world information, Gordon Campbell was a Canadian diplomat and politician who was the 34th Premier of British Columbia from 2001 to 2011. He also served as the Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Europe from 2011 to 2016. However, no public records exist of him being a professional hockey player in the NHL or any other league. The hypothesis could only be confirmed if there were information available in the context to support it.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To analyze whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let us first provide a clear definition of entailment. In the context of logic and argumentation, entailment refers to a relationship between statements, such that if the premises are true, the conclusion (or hypothesis) must also be true. In other words, it is a logically necessary consequence of the premises. Now, let us examine the given statements - the premise and the hypothesis: 1. Premise: People often dropped by asking to run a few plays. 2. Hypothesis: Nobody dropped by asking to run plays. The premise states that it is a common occurrence for people to drop by and ask to run a few plays. This implies that there have been instances where individuals made such requests. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that there have been no instances where someone dropped by asking to run plays. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is contradictory rather than entailment. This is because the premise suggests that people do frequently make requests to run plays, while the hypothesis states the opposite – that there are no instances of people making such requests. Thus, based on an analysis of the statements, we can conclude that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. In fact, if the premise (statement 1) were true, it would directly contradict the hypothesis (statement 2), making it false. Entailment requires that the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion, which is not the case here."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

Like at least one other reviewer, I was, on numerous occasions, laughing out loud. Yellow is energetic, playful, self-aware, explorative. Don't expect Bergman here. This movie is about a youth in the early- to mid-60s in Sweden and about the issues, read *contradictions*, that the nation and the world were facing. At times Yellow appears to be an earnest social-political documentary, with Lena, the main character, and others interviewing both common people and politicians (e.g. Olaf Palme at home). At other times, Yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary. All the while, Yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring Lena's life - her home life, her loves, her political views, her view of herself. She is a complete person  complex, flawed, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. And placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director, Sjöman, and his crew documenting themselves documenting Lena. It is this that, for me, really gives Yellow wings. Not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways, reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice, but their presence is itself another layer of the film; they are filming themselves filming themselves.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Whose message said we are solely grieved to be among beasts like these who believe in God nor in anything? from the following article ? In 1688, the Spanish sent three more expeditions, two by sea and one by land. The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, discovered Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including a woman who had been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, Juan Bautista Chapa, wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location. In early 1689, Spanish authorities received a plea, written in French. Jumano scouts had received these papers from the Caddo, who asked that they be delivered to the Spanish. The papers included a parchment painting of a ship, as well as a written message from Jean L'Archevêque. The message read: I do not know what sort of people you are. We are French[;] we are among the savages[;] we would like much to be Among the Christians such as we are[.] ... we are solely grieved to be among beasts like these who believe neither in God nor in anything.

She cuddled the infant before bedtime.","completion":"To determine if the word \\"cuddle\\" is used in the same way in both sentences, I will first define the word and then analyze its context in each sentence. Step 1: Define \\"cuddle\\" Cuddle is a verb, meaning to hold someone or something close in one's arms in a loving, comforting, or affectionate way. Step 2: Analyze the context of \\"cuddle\\" in the first sentence In the first sentence, \\"I'm cold; can you roll over here and cuddle me, honey?\\", the speaker is asking another person to hold them close in a loving and comforting way to keep them warm. The context implies affection and warmth between the two individuals, likely in a romantic relationship. Step 3: Analyze the context of \\"cuddle\\" in the second sentence In the second sentence, \\"She cuddled the infant before bedtime.\\", the subject (she) is holding the infant close in a comforting manner, likely to provide warmth, affection, and a sense of security. The context here is between a caretaker (possibly a parent) and the infant. Step 4: Compare the two contexts By comparing the two contexts, we can see that the word \\"cuddle\\" is used in a similar way in both sentences, as it involves holding someone close in a comforting and affectionate manner. The primary difference is the relationship between the individuals involved in cuddling – a romantic relationship in the first sentence and a caregiver-infant relationship in the second sentence. However, the core meaning and purpose of the word \\"cuddle\\" are consistent in both sentences – to provide comfort, warmth, and affection via physical closeness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Simultaneous solitaire is a type of double solitaire that allows for as many players as possible. Make sure that each deck is different and distinguishable from the others to avoid confusion. Remove the 2 jokers from each deck. It's important to make sure that every player properly shuffles their deck. If not, 1 player could have a massive advantage over the others. To shuffle, you can spread all the cards from a deck out on a table faced down. Mix them up with your hands and assemble them back into a pile when you're finished. Don't mix more than 1 deck at a time in a single area. If you're spreading the cards out, it's very easy for them to get mixed together. Simultaneous solitaire is played by everyone at once and revolves around speed. To ensure that the game is as fair as possible, use a whistle or a clap to announce the start of play. Players must place lower numbered black cards beneath higher numbered red cards and vice versa. With your stock pile facing down, flip the top card on the deck. Look at the card and look at the tableau and assess your options. You must place the cards in alternating colors in descending numerical order. You can only place cards in descending numerical order on top of each other. You cannot place a black 8 above a red 7. However, if you have a red 7 in your stock pile and a black 8 on the tableau, you can place the red 7 below the black 8. For example, a jack of diamonds or hearts can only be placed below a queen of spades or clubs. You can send cards that you can't place from the stock pile to the discard pile. You can take cards from the piles in the tableau and place them beneath other piles. If pile 1 has a 10 of clubs and pile 5 has a jack of hearts, place the 10 of clubs below the jack of hearts in pile 5. Flip the last card in pile 1 upwards after you've moved the 10. As the game goes on, you'll be using the tableau more and more. You will also need to move the cards on the tableau so you can access the face down cards in the piles. It's customary in solitaire to place all the aces in their own section of the playing area. To finish a pile, you need to place all of the 12 cards of each suit on top of their ace. For example, you have an ace of spades off to the side and you find the 2 of spades. Place the 2 on top of the ace. Do the same when you find the 3 of spades and so on. The winner is the first person to complete all 4 piles. If nobody is able to finish the game, the winner is the person with the most piles completed. A completed pile consists of 13 cards from ace to king in the same suit. You can keep playing after the winner finishes to find out who comes second, third, fourth, and so on. Summary:","completion":"Simultaneous solitaire is a multi-player, speed-based game where each player uses a distinguishable deck with jokers removed. Players need to properly shuffle their decks to avoid imbalances. The game starts with a signal, such as a whistle or clap, and players aim to place cards in alternating colors and descending numerical order. Aces are placed in their own section and the goal is to complete piles with 13 cards of the same suit, from ace to king. The winner is the first to complete all four piles or the one with the most piles completed if no one finishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: An antidote to cure vampirism. for the following movie plot: Three strangers--Thomas, Marc, and Brigitte--are coming to cure four sisters (for want of names, I shall call them Catherine, Nicole, Sylvie, and Marie) of their vampirism. Legend has it that vampire hunters ran a sword through Catherine's heart during the reign of Louis XV, and villagers raped Nicole and blinded Sylvie with a pitchfork. But they neglected to cut off their heads, and so the sisters survived. Today, they live on a manor, surrounded by crosses and protected from the villagers. Thomas, Marc, and Brigitte don't buy the legend. They think the sisters are simply humans who have been driven mad by years of persecution and villagers who think of them as monsters. Curing them will require only dispelling the sisters' belief that they are vampires. The first step is to burn all the crosses around the house. Catherine succumbs to Thomas' promise to cure her, but Marie feels that this is a betrayal and that Catherine must die to protect the other three. Catherine and Marie stage a sword fight, but it is Marie who gets stabbed. The next morning, Catherine goes off with Thomas to see if she can get over her fear of sunlight (she can't).With the crosses removed from around the house the sisters are free to roam. This causes fear among the villagers, and they gang up to search for and kill the sisters. When Nicole goes wandering in the village, the villagers get her. They also kill Brigitte, who happened to be standing nearby. The villagers then storm the manor. Sylvie is wounded. Thomas tells Catherine that he doesn't think she is a monster and asks for 'the kiss of the vampire.' Catherine obliges. When Thomas comes to, he has been turned into a vampire. So the legend was true! To escape the angry villagers, Catherine takes Thomas through a secret passage leading to the beach.

Does the sentence \\"At the age of 15, he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst Gábor Szegő.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"At what age did Von Neumann begin to study advance calculus?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"At the age of 15, he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst Gábor Szegő.\\" provides a valid answer to the question, \\"At what age did Von Neumann begin to study advanced calculus?\\" The provided sentence shares valuable information about Von Neumann's academic journey. From the sentence, we can deduce that Von Neumann started studying advanced calculus when he was 15 years old. Moreover, the sentence also highlights that his studies on the subject were under the guidance of Gábor Szegő, a well-known analyst. John von Neumann was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, and computer scientist, among other things. He made significant contributions to various disciplines, including quantum mechanics, set theory, and linear programming. He also developed the mathematical framework for the modern theory of quantum physics and was one of the pioneers in computer science. During his career, von Neumann collaborated with numerous scientists and mathematicians, including Gábor Szegő, who was a prominent mathematician in his own right, specializing in fields such as analysis and combinatorics. It is likely that von Neumann's early exposure to advanced mathematical topics, such as advanced calculus, under the tutelage of an esteemed educator like Szegő, played a critical role in shaping his thinking and the subsequent breakthroughs he achieved throughout his life. In summary, the sentence clearly answers the question by stating that Von Neumann began studying advanced calculus at the age of 15 under the guidance of Gábor Szegő, a renowned analyst. This fact illustrates the prodigious talent of von Neumann, who engaged in highly advanced studies at an incredible young age. His early involvement with advanced calculus likely contributed to his success in mathematics, physics, computer science, and other disciplines that have had significant impacts on the modern world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

People thought that poetry was the new rock 'n' roll. However, despite the brief popularity of a few pop poets, poetry and pop music didn't seem to mix. But are they really so different? If you look back at the origins of poetry, there is a strong connection between poems and popular music. In Greek mythology, for example, the muse Erato is pictured with a lyre in her hand, and looks just like the ancestor of the modern rock star with his electric guitar. In addition, the poets Shelley and Byron were as famous in the nineteenth century as the pop stars of today. But despite their common origins, there are many differences between poetry and pop music. Pop songs are always written for a public performance, whereas poetry often isn't. And the lyrics in pop songs sometimes have less rhythm than those in poetry. This is because the music provides the rhythm rather than the words. Pop lyrics are also simpler and often keep on saying the same thing. This repetition works well in a performance and means that pop songs are easier for people to sing and learn by heart. Both songs and poems tell a story or talk about feelings. Songs in particular deal with the different stages in a relationship, such as falling in love or breaking up. The words and ideas in songs are usually easier to understand than those in \\"serious\\" poetry. However, talented performers like Paul McCartney, or newer stars like Robbe Williams, often give simple songs more expression when they perform them. And some of the best lines from pop lyrics are as beautiful as poetry.

Answer a question about this article: From the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, large areas of India were annexed by the British East India Company of British Empire. Dissatisfaction with Company rule led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857, after which the British provinces of India were directly administered by the British Crown and witnessed a period of both rapid development of infrastructure and economic stagnation. During the first half of the 20th century, a nationwide struggle for independence was launched with the leading party involved being the Indian National Congress which was later joined by other organizations. The subcontinent gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, after the British provinces were partitioned into the dominions of India and Pakistan and the princely states all acceded to one of the new states.

Questions: What is a type of hill? Options: - mountain - flat land - pool - valley - flat ground Answer:","completion":"The option most in line with common sense to answer the question about a type of hill is \\"mountain.\\" A mountain is a landform that rises prominently above its surroundings, featuring a peak or multiple peaks that are generally steeper and higher than those of a hill. Mountains are formed through various geological processes such as tectonic plate movements, volcanic activity, or erosion, making them a natural fit for a type of hill. Let me expand on the other options as well: - Flat land: This option is not in line with the answer because flat land, as its name suggests, is characterized by an even terrain with little to no elevation. Hills, on the other hand, are known to have a higher elevation compared to their surroundings and feature a distinct slope. - Pool: A pool is a body of water, either natural or man-made, and therefore doesn't qualify as a type of hill. It is more related to water bodies like ponds, lakes, and reservoirs. - Valley: A valley is a low area between hills or mountains, which can be formed through the erosion of the surrounding land by rivers or glaciers, or simply due to the movement of the Earth’s crust. Valleys generally have a lower elevation than hills or mountains, so this option isn't a suitable answer for the question. - Flat ground: Similar to flat land, flat ground is characterized by its evenness and lack of significant elevation. It is more associated with plains and plateaus, rather than hills, which typically have a higher elevation and a sloping terrain. In conclusion, out of the provided options, the one that best answers the question about a type of hill is \\"mountain.\\" Mountains are an elevated landform created by various geological processes, featuring steep slopes, higher elevations, and peaks that stand out in the surrounding landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Two women have just undergone different types of mutations without them being aware of it. Kim has just had a mutation in the DNA of her sex cells. Holly has had a mutation in her body cells. Both mutations would be able to be discovered if they happen to go to a doctor, and the doctor knows to look for it, but that is unlikely since the women are unaware these changes happened. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Whose mutation is less likely to cause cancer? Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. Answer:","completion":"Kim's mutation is less likely to cause cancer. This is because her mutation occurred in the DNA of her sex cells (germline mutation), which does not directly affect her body cells' functions. While a germline mutation can be passed on to her offspring and potentially cause a hereditary disease in the next generation, it does not typically lead to cancer in the individual with the mutation. On the other hand, Holly's mutation occurred in her body cells (somatic mutation). Somatic mutations can directly impact the functions of the body cells and potentially lead to serious medical conditions, such as cancer, if the mutated gene is involved in cell growth regulation or other crucial cellular processes. Since Holly's mutation affects her body cells that can proliferate and pass the mutation to their descendants, the likelihood of cancer development is higher in her case compared to Kim."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mayor Marion Barry was arrested July 4 and charged with stalking, police said. On July 4, the U.S. Park Police arrested Barry and charged him with misdemeanor stalking. About 8:45 p.m. in Anacostia Park, a Washington woman flagged down a Park Police officer on patrol and pointed to Barry, who was in another car. The woman said Barry was stalking her, Park Police spokesman Sgt. David Schlosser said. Barry was taken into custody, processed and released, but he must make a court appearance for the charge. A court date has not been set. Barry's other run-ins with the law have included a federal sting operation in 1990, when he was mayor. Surveillance cameras caught him smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room. Despite his fall from grace, he was re-elected in 1994 to a four-year term as mayor. In his latest political comeback in 2004, Barry won a seat on the D.C. Council, on which he continues to serve. Barry was arrested in 2002 when traces of marijuana and cocaine were found in his car after he was stopped in the Buzzard Point area of Southwest D.C. No charges were filed, and Barry claimed that the drugs were planted. And in 2006, Park Police officers stopped him for driving too slowly, prompting him to accuse authorities of targeting him. Barry had been on probation since 2005 for not filing or paying income taxes for several years. Last year he again failed to file a tax return, and his probation was extended to May 2011, according to the Washington City Paper. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article focuses mainly on the repeated legal issues faced by former D.C. Mayor and current Washington councilman, Marion Barry. The significant events detailed in the article are as follows: 1. Recent Arrest for Stalking: The article starts by reporting Barry's most recent arrest on July 4, for misdemeanor stalking. A woman in Anacostia Park accused him of stalking her. He was arrested, processed, and released, but is required to appear in court. The date for this court appearance has not yet been set. 2. Historical Legal Troubles: The article provides a brief overview of Barry's history with legal problems. It makes mention of a 1990 federal sting operation where Barry was filmed smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room at a time he was serving as the mayor of D.C. Even after that, he was re-elected as Mayor in 1994, serving a four-year term. 3. Barry's Comebacks: Despite his history with the law and drug use in particular, Barry successfully won a seat on the D.C. Council in 2004, a position he still held at the time of this article. 4. Previous Arrests and Accusations: The article also mentions several other incidents involving Barry. In 2002, he was arrested when traces of marijuana and cocaine were found in his car in the Buzzard Point area, though no charges were filed. Barry implicated that the drugs were planted. In 2006, Park Police stopped him for driving too slowly, which led him to accuse authorities of targeting him specifically. 5. Tax-Related Legal Trouble: Fiscal issues have also caused problems for Barry. His noncompliance in filing and paying his income taxes resulted in a probationary period that began in 2005. The article mentions that Barry failed to file his tax return in the year prior to this report, which caused his probation to be extended to May 2011. Altogether, this article paints a picture of Marion Barry as a public figure repeatedly entangled with legal issues, ranging from drug use and stalking to tax evasion, despite his recurring presence in D.C.'s political scene."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: A team of archaeologists studied two human settlements, village Alpha from about 11000 years ago and village Beta, which existed 9000 years ago. Village Beta was bigger, because their inhabitants already knew about and practiced agriculture. But I can use this background: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. What is an answer for this question: Which village had a more dependable food supply? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information, it can be concluded that Village Beta had a more dependable food supply in comparison to Village Alpha. There are several factors that contribute to this conclusion. First, Village Beta existed 9,000 years ago, which is closer to the time when agriculture was invented (around 10,000 years ago). By this period, the inhabitants of Village Beta had already gained knowledge about and practiced agriculture, which led to a larger and more stable food supply compared to Village Alpha, which was from 11,000 years ago - prior to the invention of agriculture. The practice of agriculture provides several advantages that result in a more dependable food supply. Agriculture allows for the cultivation of crops, which can be grown according to the needs of the population. This contrasts with a reliance on hunting and gathering, as practiced by the inhabitants of Village Alpha, in which the availability of food is subject to the availability and abundance of wild animals and plants. Agriculture also enables individuals to predict and manage their food resources more effectively, as crops can be grown and harvested systematically. Moreover, as mentioned in the background information provided, the advent of agriculture allowed humans to settle in villages and cities for the first time. This suggests that Village Beta was likely a more stable, established community that could more effectively support its population's food needs. Its larger size echoes the fact that agriculture, with its dependable food supply, had a direct impact on population growth due to the presence of more food and the benefits of a settled life. While the higher death rates occurring from crowded living conditions and diseases did affect the population growth, the fact that there was a steady increase in birth rates associated with the dependable food supply indicates the advantage that Village Beta had over Village Alpha in terms of food availability. In summary, the more dependable food supply in Village Beta, resulting from the practice of agriculture, the settled lifestyle, and the larger population size, establishes it as having a more reliable food supply compared to Village Alpha, whose inhabitants did not yet have access to the benefits of agriculture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Seeders are those who continue to share the file after it has been downloaded. The more the seeders there are the faster the download will be. Can we draw the following conclusion? Utorrent does not involve file sharing.","completion":"No, we cannot draw the conclusion that \\"uTorrent does not involve file sharing.\\" On the contrary, uTorrent is a BitTorrent client that enables file sharing through the BitTorrent protocol. The BitTorrent protocol relies on peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing, allowing users to distribute files, such as movies, music, games, and software, more efficiently and reliably than traditional centralized file-serving methods. When you use uTorrent or any other BitTorrent client to download a file, you are essentially downloading small chunks of the file from multiple sources or peers who have the file (or parts of it) on their computers. These sources are called \\"seeders\\" if they have the complete file and \\"peers\\" when they have a portion of it. After downloading a chunk, your computer simultaneously becomes a source for that chunk, uploading it to other peers who are attempting to download the file. Therefore, uTorrent and similar clients facilitate file sharing by leveraging network connections and resources from users who have the desired file or parts of it. This distributed nature of file sharing in BitTorrent allows for faster downloads, as you are downloading from several peers at once, and improved reliability since it is less reliant on centralized servers. To make uTorrent faster, consider: 1. Updating to the latest version of uTorrent, as newer versions may have performance optimizations and bug fixes. 2. Checking your internet connection speed and ensuring that it is stable and fast enough to support file sharing. 3. Limiting the number of active downloads and uploads to avoid overloading your bandwidth and network resources. 4. Allowing uTorrent through your firewall to ensure that it can establish connections with other peers and seeders. 5. Adjusting the settings of uTorrent, such as setting an appropriate maximum upload and download speed based on your internet connection, enabling protocol encryption to bypass ISP throttling, and configuring port forwarding in your router if necessary. 6. Choosing torrent files with a high number of seeders relative to leechers, as this would mean that the file is widely available and you can download it from multiple sources simultaneously. 7. Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to avoid ISP throttling or any restrictions that may be placed on P2P file sharing by your internet service provider. 8. Maintaining a good seed-to-leech ratio, which means uploading files as much as you download. This not only helps the community and the health of the torrent ecosystem but also could improve your download speeds, as some trackers may prioritize seeders over leechers when allocating resources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Lions from Africa and leopard in a box found in residential area of Bangkok. Pet-shop owner Montri Boonprom-on, 41, arrested and could face prison. Thailand is a hub of the international black market in protected animals.","completion":"Title: Bangkok Police Seize African Lions and Boxed Leopard, Arrest Pet-Shop Owner In a shocking incident at a residential area in Bangkok, authorities discovered several African lions and a leopard confined in a box. The seizure followed the arrest of the pet-shop owner, Montri Boonprom-on, 41, who is now facing possible imprisonment for his involvement in the illegal trade of protected animals. As a significant hub of the international black market for protected animals, Thailand has struggled to eliminate this nefarious trade. This recent arrest highlights the persistent problem in the region and raises growing concerns over animal welfare. The investigation began when local residents raised suspicions about the presence of exotic animals in their neighborhood. Police responded promptly and were astonished to find the lions from Africa and a leopard boxed-up in terrible conditions. Many of these animals are protected under international law, which prohibits their sale and trade. Montri Boonprom-on, the pet-shop owner, is now in police custody. If convicted, he could face several years in prison for possessing and trading protected animals. This incident underscores the need for stricter law enforcement and increased vigilance against the illicit animal trade. Thailand's position as a hub in the black market for protected animals has been well documented. The country's porous borders and lax enforcement have made it an attractive transit point for traffickers. This latest incident also highlights the demand for exotic and often illegal pets, which continues to fuel the trade. In response to this steady increase in the illegal wildlife trade, authorities have begun to ramp up efforts to tackle the issue. Steps include stricter border controls, the implementation of tougher penalties for offenders, and the promotion of public awareness campaigns. Animal welfare organizations and activists have frequently called for harsher measures against the perpetrators involved in this black market trade. Many argue that only with severe penalties and diligent enforcement of laws will the illegal animal trade be curtailed. As the plight of the African lions and boxed leopard in Bangkok makes headlines, the crackdown on the illegal wildlife trade will likely experience a renewed sense of urgency. All eyes now turn to the Thai authorities to see how effectively they can address this persistent problem and protect some of the world's most vulnerable species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Where is a tree hugger likely to reside? Options: - forest - rainforest - san francisco - state park - university The answer is \\"san francisco\\" because Answer:","completion":"To determine where a tree hugger is likely to reside, let's analyze each option step-by-step. 1. Forest: A tree hugger is someone who deeply appreciates and wants to preserve nature, particularly trees. While a forest may be an ideal place for a tree hugger to visit and appreciate nature, it is not an ideal place for them to reside due to the lack of human infrastructure, amenities, and other resources for a comfortable life. 2. Rainforest: Similar to the forest, a rainforest would be an attractive destination for a tree hugger to explore and appreciate the dense ecosystem. However, residing in a rainforest would pose significant challenges due to environmental factors like high humidity, heavy rainfall, and a vast number of diverse species, some of which could be dangerous. Additionally, a human presence might disrupt the delicate balance of the rainforest. 3. San Francisco: San Francisco is a city known for its environmentally conscious culture and various green initiatives. This would make it a viable option for a tree hugger to reside in, as they can participate in conservation efforts, engage with like-minded individuals, and have access to city amenities. 4. State Park: While a state park may provide a beautiful natural environment that a tree hugger would appreciate, it is not an optimal place for them to reside due to similar reasons as the forest and rainforest. It is more suited for visits and hikes rather than permanent residence. 5. University: A university is a location where students, faculty, and staff come together to learn and work. While it is not an environment specifically catering to tree huggers, it is possible that a tree hugger might reside in a university if they are pursuing a degree in environmental science or similar fields. However, the university itself would not be the primary reason for their residence. After analyzing each of the options, the answer is \\"San Francisco.\\" Out of the available options, San Francisco provides the best combination of environmental awareness, conservation efforts, and access to amenities and resources for a tree hugger to reside comfortably."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

There he meets his friend, Italian Major Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou), a doctor. They go out carousing, but are interrupted by a bombing raid. Frederic and English Red Cross nurse Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes) take shelter in the same place. The somewhat drunk Frederic makes a poor first impression. Rinaldi persuades Frederic to go on a double romantic date with him and two nurses, Catherine and her friend Helen Ferguson (Mary Philips). However, Rinaldi becomes annoyed when Frederic prefers Catherine, the woman the major had chosen for himself. Away by themselves, Frederic learns that she was engaged to a soldier who was killed in battle. In the darkness, he romantically seduces her, over her half-hearted resistance, and is surprised to discover she is a virgin. Their romantic relationship (forbidden by army regulation) is discovered. At Rinaldi's suggestion, Catherine is transferred to Milan. When Frederick is wounded by artillery, he finds himself in the hospital where Catherine now works. They continue their affair until he is sent back to the war. Now pregnant, Catherine runs away to Switzerland, but her many letters to her beloved sweetheart/lover are intercepted by Rinaldi, who feels he needs to rescue his friend from the romantic entanglement. Meanwhile, Frederic's letters to her are sent to the hospital which she has abandoned. After a time, Frederic cannot stand being away from Catherine any longer. He deserts his post and heads out in search of her. Returning first to the hospital in Milan, he attempts to convince the reluctant Ferguson to reveal Catherine's whereabouts to him.

Writing in 1952, after the first section of the buildings was complete, J. M. Richards, the editor of the Architectural Review, said that Nuffield was \\"a large-scale example of period-style architecture which has no justification whatever on grounds of consideration for the neighbours and represents missed opportunity of a really tragic kind\\". As the site was away from the \\"ancient colleges\\" of the city centre and in an area of \\"undistinguished nineteenth century commercial building\\", there had been a \\"rare opportunity\\" of building something \\"belonging ... to the twentieth century, and of showing that Oxford does not live only in the past\\".

He was, however, \\"thankful\\" that the building used smooth-faced stone \\"in the proper Oxford style\\" rather than rubble facing, which he said had been used elsewhere in Oxford \\"with extraordinarily unpleasing results\\".The architectural correspondent of The Times wrote that the architecture of the college was incongruous – it was \\"remarkable\\" that a college with connections to modern industry should be looking backwards in this way. \\"That a college devoted to modern scientific studies should be dressed up [in the style of an antique Cotswold manor house] has already been the subject of puzzled comment by many foreign visitors to Oxford.\\" Writing in The Observer, Patience Gray also disliked the college's design, referring to the \\"Cotswold dementia\\" of the architecture, and the college's \\"pokey windows and grotesque sugarloaf tower.\\" The chapel was described by the travel writer Jan Morris as \\"one of the sweetest little sanctuaries in Oxford\\"; \\"very simple, almost stern\\" with a contrast between the black and white pews and the \\"rich colour\\" of the stained glass.

The Bears visited Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis to play the Rams, again without Jay Cutler. However, the Rams were also without starting quarterback Sam Bradford, and instead had Kellen Clemens as backup. The Bears had won four consecutive games against the Rams. Two rookie players the Bears' defense had to contain were running back Zac Stacy, who recorded an average of 107.7 yards and three touchdowns in the previous three games, along with ranking second among rookie running backs with 537 rushing yards; and receiver Tavon Austin, who recorded 314 yards against the Indianapolis Colts in the previous week. Additionally, the Rams' offense was ranked fourth in the NFL with 54.6 percent of yardage occurring after the catch. For the Bears' offense, Jeff Joniak wrote they needed to avoid attempting to score in the red zone; in the previous three games, the Bears had 12 drives in the red zone, but managed to score only four touchdowns, while also allowing a turnover, and was ranked 13th after scoring 55 percent. Meanwhile, the Rams had forced quarterbacks to record only a 45.8 passer rating when in the red zone, along with the second lowest completion percentage, and the third fewest completions recorded. Also, St. Louis led the league in red zone interceptions with six. Finally, the Rams led the league in overall sack percentage with 9.4, while defensive end Robert Quinn had the most knockdowns and hurries in the NFL, and was second in sacks with 12. An advantage Chicago had, however, was the second-most passing touchdowns in the NFL with 15, while Josh McCown's average gain per pass is higher than Cutler's, with a 7.47 to 7.20. The Rams also did not have the capable secondary to cover the trio of Martellus Bennett, Alshon Jeffery and Brandon Marshall. St. Louis scored first on Austin's 65-yard run, and would reclaim the ball after James Laurinitis stripped Matt Fort&#233;, leading to Stacy's one-yard touchdown run. The Bears would then score on McCown's seven-yard touchdown pass to Bennett, but the Rams ended the quarter with a 21-7 lead after Clemens' six-yard touchdown pass to Jared Cook. In the second quarter, McCown threw an incomplete pass, which appeared to be a fumble, and after Rams cornerback Trumaine Johnson picked up the ball, Bears fullback Tony Fiammetta pulled him to the ground by the facemask. Kyle Long would then be involved in an incident with Rams defensive lineman William Hayes, which led to Long kicking Hayes, causing Long's brother Chris Long to restrain Kyle, who would then be penalized for a personal foul. McCown and Fiammetta would also be penalized, for intentional grounding and facemasking, respectively. Halfway through the quarter, Chicago scored after McCown threw a three-yard pass to Marshall, but Greg Zuerlein would score on a 29-yard field goal to give the Rams a 24-14 lead at halftime. The lone score of the third quarter was Zuerlein's 40-yard kick. Early in the fourth quarter, Hester recorded a 62-yard punt return for a touchdown, which was overruled by Craig Steltz's holding penalty. the Bears reached the Rams' one-yard line, but required eight plays: Michael Bush's run went for no gain; McCown's pass to Jeffery was incomplete, but a holding penalty on Brandon McGee gave the Bears a first down; Bush lost two yards on the following run; McCown's touchdown pass to Bennett was nullified by Jermon Bushrod's holding penalty; McCown's 13-yard touchdown pass to Fort&#233; was also nullified, after Fort&#233; failed to break the plane, instead placing the Bears back on the one-yard line; McCown was then sacked by Michael Brockers, but Brockers was penalized for roughing the passer; Bush failed to gain a yard on the next play; the Bears finally scored on the drive on Bush's one-yard run. On the Rams' ensuing drive, Benny Cunningham gained 27 yards, while the offense gained 48 yards from Clemens' 19 and 29 yards passes to Chris Givens and Cook, respectively. Four plays later, Cunningham scored on a nine-yard run, while Isaiah Pead scored on the two-point conversion. Devin Hester would fumble on the following kickoff, but recovered at the Bears' ten-yard line. After the Bears' offense reached their own 39-yard line, Quinn stripped McCown, and scored on the following fumble return. The game marked the third time the Bears allowed 40 points during the season for the first time since 1964. McCown set the team record for most completions with 36, two greater than Jim Miller's and Brian Griese's 34 set on November 14, 1999 and September 30, 2007, respectively. Fort&#233; recorded 77 yards in the game, adding to 6,178 career rushing yards, surpassing Neal Anderson to become the second-highest rushing leader in team history. The Bears' defense recorded the second-worst defensive output in 2013, with a negative-11.4, making the team's defense the second-worst in the NFL. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Help as much as you can. I know that the answer to the question \\"What is a kestrel?\\" is in \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears.

Question: Article: Henderson Island is a coral island raised above the South Pacific Ocean, No people live on it. The island is 9. 6 km long and 5. 1 km wide. It has an area of 37, 3 square kilometers. It became a World Heritage Site in 1988 because of its bird life. All the four kinds of special land birds can only be seen on Henderson Island. There are also fifteen non-local seabirds. Other local things include nine kinds of plants, four kinds of land snails, and one butterfly. Although no people live on the island, archaeological evidence suggests that a small Polynesian group lived here between the 12th and 15th centuries until it disappeared. The reasons for its disappearance are unknown, but are probably related to the similar disappearance of the Polynesians on Pitcairn Island. Then Hendersonians would have depended on them for many of the basics of life. On January 29* 1606, Henderson Island was discovered by Portuguese sailor Pedro Fermandes, who named it San Joao Baptista. On January 17, 1819, the island was rediscovered by British Captain Henderson, who named it Henderson Island. On March 2* 1819* Captain Henry King, sailing on the Elizabeth, landed on the island to find the Union flag already flying. His crew scratched the name of their ship on a tree, and for some years the name of the island was Elizabeth or Henderson. In the early 1980's, American businessman Arthur expressed interest in buying Henderson Island, and establishing a small settlement with an airport, farm and large houses. But the British government refused it at last* after environmentalist groups persuaded them to protect the natural ecology and environment of the island which became a World Heritage Site later.

Around 100 complaints had come into the BBC 24 hours after it went out, with numbers rising on Tuesday. The BBC said: \\"We take audibility seriously and we will look at the sound levels on the programme in time for the next episode.\\" The drama stars Sam Riley as an officer working simultaneously with the Nazis and the British Resistance. Some viewers took to Twitter to air their views on the sound levels. One user Luanne wrote: \\"I am 12 minutes into SS-GB & I'm turning on the subtitles. All this tough guy, breathy, growling, mumbling, I can't understand you!\\" TV critic Emma Bullimore told the BBC: \\"We are living in astonishingly ambitious times for TV drama, attracting world class talent to the small screen, and sometimes this means the basics of storytelling get slightly overlooked - either in terms of audibility or making a story too complicated or difficult to follow (as Sherlock was criticised for). \\"However, it does feel that mumbling is the latest bandwagon for BBC bashers to jump on and the odd muffled word gets spun into a story. Actually, my enjoyment of SS-GB wasn't marred by sound issues.\\" It's not the first time the issue of mumbling on TV dramas has been raised, with past programmes such as Jamaica Inn and Happy Valley having hit the headlines over the audio. Back in 2013, the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, told the Radio Times: \\"I don't want to sound like a grumpy old man but I think muttering is something we could look at.\\" Analysis - do flat TVs mean flat sound? Leo Kelion, technology desk editor As televisions get thinner, their makers have less space to build in speakers unless they opt to add sound equipment to the sides and/or below the screens, threatening to make them look less \\"sleek\\". In many cases families might be best advised to buy a separate soundbar or speaker system. This isn't just the case for budget TVs. In many cases manufacturers assume those that can afford the higher-end models will invest in the extra technology. Sony recently took a new approach to the problem with a TV that has no dedicated speakers but rather produces sound by vibrating the OLED screen itself. The jury is still out on how well that works. But in general, if the vast majority of programmes on yours set sound fine and only a few don't, then the problem is likely to be with how they have been mixed rather than the TVs themselves. Speaking on the Today programme, ITV's Victoria creator, Daisy Goodwin, pointed out that Riley may have made a conscious choice to not speak with perfectly clear diction in keeping with his character.

A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base, A−, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base. Paragraph: David is a chemical engineer. Yesterday, he was working on two samples, sample A and sample B.

This sentence exemplifies the vast difference between the two characters, Adam and Derrick, in their perspectives on and feelings towards rats. Adam's fear of rats is not uncommon; many people suffer from musophobia, which is the irrational fear of rodents like rats and mice. This fear can be attributed to a variety of factors: some people find the appearance of rodents repulsive, while others may associate rats with diseases or discomfort. In contrast, Derrick's love for these small creatures indicates that he likely sees rats in a completely different light. Instead of focusing on the potential negative aspects, Derrick might appreciate the fact that rats are intelligent and social animals that are capable of forming strong bonds with humans and their fellow rats. The sentence ends with \\"Adam ran away from the rats,\\" which reinforces the idea that his fear of the animals is overpowering. It is possible that Adam's fear is so intense that he cannot bear to be in close proximity to the rats even if Derrick, his friend, is present. The sentence illustrates a common and relatable scenario in which one individual’s fear may contrast another's love or fascination for the same thing or creature. It tells not only about the difference in perceptions between the characters, but also highlights human nature demonstrating how diverse and unique our opinions and feelings can be. In summary, by ending the sentence with \\"Adam ran away from the rats,\\" we emphasize Adam's strong fear and discomfort when faced with the presence of rats, offering a stark comparison to Derrick's love for the small creatures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: Paragraph: Two neighboring farms both had depleted soils due to intensive agricultural practices for decades.

Given the context: How would Jesse's parents feel as a result? Possible answers: Excited about a possible divorce, That Jesse was back to soon, Happy to see their daughter","completion":"In this context, it can be inferred that Jesse's parents would most likely feel happy to see their daughter. Given that Jesse has just returned from her honeymoon in France, the situation indicates that Jesse has recently entered a new milestone in her life – marriage. As such, her parents would most likely feel proud and excited for her. Parents are typically inclined to feel joy and happiness when their children are successful and leading lives filled with love and happiness, and marriage is regarded as a significant step towards building a fulfilling life. The honeymoon, being a celebratory trip that follows the wedding, would have without a doubt been a special opportunity for Jesse to create wonderful memories with her spouse. By visiting her parents right after her honeymoon, it is discernible that Jesse likely wants to share this happiness and these memories with her family, particularly with her parents. Therefore, her parents would understandably be delighted to see their daughter and learn about her experiences. The possibility of Jesse's parents feeling excited about a potential divorce would be quite unlikely and inappropriate in this context. A divorce would be an unhappy and emotionally challenging event, one that parents would not typically look forward to – especially after their daughter has just embarked on a new, exciting journey with her honeymoon. Moreover, there has been no indication that Jesse is unhappy in her marriage or that she desires a divorce. As a result, any form of enthusiasm surrounding a possible divorce would be entirely unconnected to the context and devoid of substantiating evidence. Similarly, the notion of Jesse's parents thinking that their daughter is \\"back too soon\\" also fails to align with the given context. Considering that Jesse has returned to visit her parents after her honeymoon, it's reasonable to assume that her parents would appreciate the opportunity to see their daughter after her important life event and would heartily welcome her. They would likely be more focused on the significance of her visit and the joy of reuniting with her, rather than obsessing over the timing of her return. In conclusion, out of the three possible answers, the most plausible feeling Jesse's parents would be experiencing is happiness and joy at seeing their daughter, especially after such a significant event as a honeymoon in France. The excitement of a possible divorce and assuming that Jesse was back too soon are not in sync with the given context and appear to be out of place when considering normal parental emotions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Briefly summarize this sentence: stocks fell sharply thursday , as investors stepped up their profit-taking amid rising interest rates and mounting pessimism about corporate earnings .","completion":"On Thursday, there was a significant drop in the stock market, largely due to investors deciding to increase their profit-taking activities. This surge in profit-taking activities arose in response to a combination of factors. Firstly, interest rates have been on an upward trend, causing investors to reassume their positions and strategies. Higher interest rates can often dissuade investments as they raise the cost of borrowing, making it more expensive for businesses to finance their operations and for investors to take out loans. Thus, rising interest rates can signal economic tightening, which can inadvertently lead to lower corporate profits and therefore, less attractive stock investments. Secondly, investors' optimism around corporate earnings has started to wane, contributing further to their decision to take profits instead of investing. Corporate earnings are an important indicator of a company's performance and a primary driver of stock prices. If investors are beginning to feel pessimistic about these, it may suggest they have concerns about the future profitability of these companies. This mass profit-taking and pessimism towards future earnings can potentially create a snowball effect, as other investors might also start selling their shares out of fear of a market downturn, leading to a sharp fall in stock prices. Overall, the significant fall in stocks is a reflection of changing investor sentiment due to rising interest rates and a bleak outlook on corporate earnings. It serves as a warning signal for potential market volatility and uncertainty in the future, leading investors to readjust their strategies accordingly."},{"prompt":"Q: Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed.

Select the topic that this about: Scientists have decoded the complete sequence of all DNA in the bacterium responsible for potentially deadly Legionnaires' disease.","completion":"The topic of discussion here is the successful decoding of the complete sequence of all DNA in the bacterium responsible for Legionnaires' disease, a significant breakthrough in the field of bacterial genetics and disease prevention. Legionnaires' disease is a severe and sometimes fatal type of pneumonia caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila. The disease typically spreads through water systems, such as air conditioners, cooling towers, and plumbing systems. Decoding the complete DNA sequence, also known as the genome, of Legionella pneumophila has provided scientists with valuable insights into the bacterium's functions, growth, and mechanisms for causing disease. Understanding the genetic makeup of the bacterium allows researchers to better comprehend the biological processes underlying its infection, proliferation, and pathogenicity. This, in turn, may lead to the development of more effective diagnostic techniques, therapeutic strategies, and preventive measures for Legionnaires' disease. The genome of Legionella pneumophila comprises a single circular chromosome that contains approximately 3.3 million base pairs and encodes around 3,000 protein-coding genes. The successful sequencing of this genome required the combined efforts of biologists, microbiologists, and bioinformaticians. They used advanced techniques, such as next-generation sequencing and computational analysis, to assemble, annotate, and interpret the genetic data. The decoded genome has revealed several interesting features of the bacterium. Some key observations include: 1. Virulence factors: The genome contains numerous genes that encode for proteins involved in the invasion of host cells, evasion of the immune system, and replication within the host. These virulence factors allow the bacterium to infect human lung cells and cause severe pneumonia. 2. Type IV secretion system (T4SS): The T4SS is a complex molecular machine present in the genome of Legionella pneumophila. It plays a crucial role in the transport of bacterial proteins into host cells, contributing to its virulence. 3. Metabolic capabilities: The genome sequence has unveiled the diverse metabolic capabilities of the bacterium, enabling it to survive and thrive in various environments, such as water systems and human lungs. 4. Regulatory mechanisms: The genome contains numerous genes that regulate the expression of other genes and control various cellular processes. Some of these regulatory mechanisms involve the response to environmental stimuli, whereas others are crucial for the bacterium's survival within host cells. The decoding of the Legionella pneumophila genome has opened the door to various research directions. Scientists are now able to study the bacterium's gene functions and interactions in detail, giving them a robust foundation for creating targeted treatments and prevention strategies. This includes the development of vaccines, specific antimicrobial agents, and novel methods for eradicating the bacterium from water systems. In conclusion, the successful decoding of the complete DNA sequence of the bacterium responsible for Legionnaires' disease has provided valuable insights into the organism's biology and pathogenicity. This breakthrough offers hope for the development of more effective interventions in combating this potentially deadly disease and underscores the importance of continued research in bacterial genetics and genomics.

The question is whether he and his administration can successfully work in tandem with Congress to address the issues at hand. With the lingering economic doldrums, high jobless rates, and healthcare issues, it will be a difficult journey; but the stakes are high for the American people who have grown weary of promises and seek results. In the coming months, it will be crucial for the administration to demonstrate progress in tackling the nation's most pressing concerns, in an effort to restore public confidence in President Obama's leadership. It is with this increased pressure from the masses, that both the President and Congress must put aside party politics and find common ground for the betterment of the country. Social media, being a key platform for communication and possibly a harbinger for public opinion, continues to shed light on the challenges faced by the government. As the people's voice grows louder and more impatient, it is vital that steps are taken to address their concerns. The battle over healthcare, in particular, seems to encapsulate the divide that President Obama must now reconcile. Ideological and political differences continue to be at the heart of congressional debates, making for slow and arduous progress. The American people, however, cannot afford to wait, and a solution must be found that satisfies all parties involved. Furthermore, it is crucial to expanding employment opportunities and providing resources for small businesses that are essential to the nation's economy. The President must strike a balance between upholding his campaign promises and ensuring bipartisan cooperation. It is through this collaboration that the administration may be able to implement effective policies and help the American economy rebound. In conclusion, with President Obama's approval ratings sliding, now is the time for him and his administration to step up their game and fulfill their pledge of hope and change. For the many who supported him on his road to the presidency, it is a reminder that trust and faith are on the line, and only with tangible results can they be preserved and regained. In order to accomplish this, the government must dispel the shadows of doubt cast by social media, and work diligently to overcome the challenges it faces. Only then can the nation begin to heal and move forward."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Every day since March 8, people all over the world keep asking the same question: Where did Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 go? It turns out to be the biggest mystery in modern aviation history. In the early hours of March 8, a Boeing 777 took off from Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur . It was heading to Beijing. But about two hours into the flight, the plane lost contact. There were 239 people on board the Malaysia Airlines flight, including 154 Chinese. About 12 countries, including China, the US and Australia, have joined the search for the missing plane and passengers. The plane's disappearance was a \\"mystery\\", said officials. The plane was flying at a height of more than 10,000 meters when it suddenly lost contact. The weather was clear. The pilots didn't make any distress calls . When a plane crashes, broken parts are usually recovered. But up to April 2, officials have not found anything. People are also talking about a possible hijacking. Interpol said that two people on the flight used stolen passports. But that information alone isn't evidence of a hijack. The investigation is still going on. It could take months or even years to find out what happened to the flight. \\"We are looking at all possibilities,\\" said Malaysian Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein. \\"The most important thing now is to find the plane.\\" On March 24 came a piece of sad news.

Information: - Hip hop music, also called hip-hop or rap music, is a music genre formed in the United States in the 1970s which consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching, break dancing, and graffiti writing. Other elements include sampling (or synthesis), and beatboxing. - Def Jam Recordings is an American record label, focused predominantly on hip hop and urban music, owned by Universal Music Group.

The film grossed 1,482,892 in its opening weekend and 2,702,578 during its theatrical run . - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\" - Russell Wendell Simmons (born October 4, 1957) is an American entrepreneur, producer and author.

Rapping is distinct from spoken-word poetry in that it is performed in time to a beat (external meter). Rapping is often associated with and a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon can be said to predate hip-hop culture by centuries. It can also be found in alternative rock such as that of Cake, Gorillaz and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Rapping is also used in Kwaito music, a genre that originated in Johannesburg, South Africa, and is composed of hip-hop elements. Another form of rap that predates hip hop was Muhammad Ali's rhythmic poetry used to taunt his opponents in the 1960s and 1970s. - Michael \\"Mike\\" Tollin (born October 6, 1955) is an American film and television producer/director.

First, we need to understand the equation: -9*m - 27 = -0*m. Think of \\"m\\" like pieces of candy. So, we have -9 pieces of candy times \\"m\\" minus 27 equals -0 pieces of candy times \\"m\\". Now, when we look at -0*m, that just means we have zero pieces of candy times \\"m\\". No matter what value \\"m\\" has, if you multiply it by zero, you'll always get zero. So, our equation becomes -9*m - 27 = 0. Now we want to solve for \\"m\\", which means we want to find how many pieces of candy \\"m\\" represents. To do that, we first need to move the 27 to the other side. Imagine you're moving 27 Lego bricks from one side of a balance to the other. You want to add 27 to both sides to keep it balanced: -9*m - 27 + 27 = 0 + 27 That simplifies to: -9*m = 27 Now, we need to find \\"m\\" by getting rid of the -9. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -9: (-9*m) / -9 = 27 / -9 This simplifies to: m = -3 So, little buddy, the solution is m = -3.

The rise of the Amorite kingdoms in Mesopotamia brought about deep and lasting repercussions in its political, social and economic structure, especially in southern Mesopotamia. The division into kingdoms replaced the Babylonian city-states in southern Mesopotamia. Men, land and cattle ceased to belong physically to the gods or to the temples and the king. The new Amorite monarchs gave or let out for an indefinite period numerous parcels of royal or sacerdotal land, freed the inhabitants of several cities from taxes and forced labour, which seems to have encouraged a new society to emerge: a society of big farmers, free citizens and enterprising merchants, which was to last throughout the ages. The priest assumed the service of the gods and cared for the welfare of his subjects, but the economic life of the country was no longer exclusively (or almost exclusively) in their hands. In general terms, Mesopotamian civilization survived the arrival of Amorites, as the indigenous Babylonian civilisation had survived the short period of Gutian dynasty of Sumer's domination of the south during the restless period after the fall of the Akkadian Empire that had preceded the rise of the Third Dynasty of Ur (the \\"Neo-Sumerian Empire\\"). The religious, ethical, technological, scientific and artistic directions in which Mesopotamia had been developing since the 4th millennium BC were not greatly affected by the Amorites' hegemony. They continued to worship the Sumero-Akkadian gods, and the older Sumerian myths and epic tales were piously copied, translated, or adapted, generally with only minor alterations. As for the scarce artistic production of the period, there is little to distinguish it from the preceding Ur III era. The era of the Amorite kingdoms, c. 2000 - 1595 BC, is sometimes known as the \\"Amorite period\\" in Mesopotamian history. The principal Amorite dynasties arose in Mari, Yamhad, Qatna, fairly briefly in Assyria (under Shamshi-Adad I), Isin, Larsa and Babylon. Babylon, originally a minor state at its founding in 1894 BC, became briefly the major power in the ancient world during the reign of Hammurabi in the first part of the 18th century BC, and it was from then that southern Mesopotamia came to be known as Babylonia, the north long before it evolved into Assyria.

Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor and Gerri Peev. PUBLISHED:. 07:05 EST, 18 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:08 EST, 18 July 2013. David Cameron and Nick Clegg today stepped up government pressure on Muirfield golf club to end its ban on women members. As the prestigious Open Championship began at the historic course, the Prime Minister condemned policies which 'look more to the past than they do to the future' while his deputy tore into the 'inexplicable' and 'anachronistic' rules. Culture Secretary Maria Miller is boycotting the Open in protest as her Labour opponent Harriet Harman called for male-only clubs to be banned by law. Row: David Cameron and Nick Clegg spoke out against the 'anachronistic' male-only rules which they said belong in the past. Teeing off: The controversy erupted as play got under way at the Open Championship which is being held at Muirfield Golf Club, East Lothian but boycotted by senior ministers. Muirfield, in East Lothian, has been home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers - one of the oldest clubs in the world - since 1891. Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond,. Culture Secretary Mrs Miller and Sport Minister Hugh Robertson have. all announced they will boycott this week’s golf for its perceived. sexism. However it has faced a storm of controversy in the run-up to the Open because it still refuses to admit women members. The Prime Minister's spokesman said Mr Cameron was not attending the Open and 'entirely understands' why Mrs Miller was not going. Asked about all-male clubs, he added: 'The Prime Minister has a great deal of sympathy with the view that exclusive memberships of this sort look more to the past than they do to the future.' Mr Clegg used his LBC 97.3 phone-in. to voice his opposition to the male-only policy: 'I was just dismayed. and incredibly surprised to hear this still goes on in this day and age. 'I find it so out of step with everything else that's happening in the rest of society. 'I think many people will just shake their head and say \\"how on earth is this still possible in this day and age?\\".' Demand for action: Maria Miller wants further action after the offensive comments were made. However the head of golf's governing body claimed male-only golf clubs are ‘for some. people a way of life that they rather like’. Peter Dawson, chief executive of the. Royal and Ancient, insisted that it was not sexist to exclude women from clubs. He said yesterday: ‘I really don’t think that a golf club. that has a policy of being a place where like-minded men or indeed women. go, play golf together and do their thing together, ranks up against. some of these other forms of discrimination. ‘For some people, it is a way of life. they rather like. I don’t think they are intending to do others down. You can dress it up to be a lot more if you want. ‘But if on a Sunday morning the guy, or. the lady, gets out of the marital bed, if you like, and plays golf with. his chums and comes back in the afternoon - that is not on any kind of. par with racial discrimination or anti-Semitism.’ The row comes after Culture Secretary Mrs Miller also delivered an extraordinary attack on the BBC’s sexist sports coverage. In a scathing letter to the director-general Lord Hall, she expressed her anger at presenter John Inverdale’s remarks about Wimbledon singles champion Marion Bartoli. Mrs Miller, who also called for better coverage of women’s sport, demanded updates on ‘further action that is likely to be taken’ over the comments, which prompted hundreds of complaints to the BBC. Earlier this month Inverdale, who is thought to be paid about £600,000 a year, said of Miss Bartoli during coverage of the Wimbledon women’s final: ‘I just wonder if her dad did say to her when she was 12, 13, 14 maybe: “Listen, you are never going to be, you know, a looker. ‘“You are never going to be somebody like a [Maria] Sharapova, you’re never going to be 5 feet 11, you’re never going to be somebody with long legs, so you have to compensate for that. You are going to have to be the most dogged, determined fighter that anyone has ever seen on the tennis court if you are going to make it.” And she kind of is.’ The comments generated more than 700 complaints, and led to demands that Inverdale should be sacked. But the 55-year-old escaped severe sanction by writing a letter of apology to the French champion, and apologising on-air the day after the final. French tennis player Marion Bartoli, was the subject of Inverdale's comments. The beleaguered presenter faced criticism several years ago after he seemed to joke about the Duchess of Cornwall’s appearance. She told Lord Hall: ‘I am writing to express my concern over the comments made by John Inverdale about Marion Bartoli, during the BBC’s radio coverage of the Wimbledon women’s final.’ She added: ‘It is ... a matter of some concern to me that any comment on the looks and stature of a female athlete could be made in the context of one of the highlights of the UK’s, and indeed the world’s, sporting calendar. ‘I am sure you will agree with me that it is vital that young women and girls in this country feel motivated both to take part in and to watch coverage of sport, and to know that they are included in the enjoyment of sport, and catered for by the media just as much as the male audience. ‘Whilst I note that Mr Inverdale has. apologised both on-air and in writing to Ms Bartoli, I would be grateful. for an update on any further action that is likely to be taken. following [the] complaints, and whether there may be positive steps that. the BBC could take in the future to ensure that the perception of and. commentary on female athletes, and women’s sport generally, are as. positive and inclusive as possible.’ The 55-year-old escaped severe sanction by writing a letter of apology to the French champion, and apologising on-air the day after the final. The letter was also copied to the chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten. Inverdale. is already set to be replaced as the BBC’s main athletics presenter by a. woman, Gabby Logan, who agreed that his comments on Bartoli ‘wasn’t. appropriate’. The beleaguered Inverdale faced down criticism several years ago after he seemed to joke about the Duchess of Cornwall’s appearance. In a radio interview with Zara Phillips in 2006, he asked if his studio colleagues could remember the name of the horse Princess Anne rode when she won the European Championship in 1971. When no answer was forthcoming, he suggested: ‘Camilla.’ His latest comments drew a furious response from other sports stars and politicians. Men’s singles champion Andy Murray’s mother Judy described it as a ‘huge gaffe’. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC has made clear that John Inverdale’s comments were unacceptable and fell well beneath the standards expected of our presenters. ‘John sincerely regrets that he made such an inappropriate statement and for the offence caused. As he said on-air the following day, he has written to Marion Bartoli to apologise and the BBC has also apologised for John’s remarks.’ He added that ‘the BBC has a proud record of supporting women’s sport, with the current coverage of Euro 2013 [the women’s football European Championships] the most recent highlight in a summer of unprecedented coverage’. Of the 16 Euro 2013 matches it will show, 14 will be on BBC Three, with just two on BBC Two. The letter was also copied to the chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten. The spokesman also stressed that the BBC has appointed an ‘editorial lead’ for women’s sport ‘which has helped ensure significantly increased coverage across our daily sporting output’, while the company as a whole ‘is taking steps to clearly communicate to those who work for us what constitutes inappropriate behaviour or language’. A BBC source claimed the Inverdale controversy was a ‘one-off’. However, the outrage following the Bartoli comments does not mark the first time the BBC’s sports coverage has been criticised due to sexism. Jacqui Oatley, who became Match of the Day’s first woman commentator in 2007, said she had a ‘very difficult time’ due to outdated attitudes. ‘Mentally it was a huge challenge. I didn’t enjoy it for a second, I can’t pretend I did,’ she said. The BBC also drew criticism when no women made the ten-strong shortlist for the Sports Personality of the Year award in 2011. In the row over Muirfield’s men-only policy, Mrs Miller is to be joined in her boycott of the Open by sports minister Hugh Robertson and Alex Salmond. Last weekend Mrs Miller accused golf of turning a blind eye to sexism, saying: ‘The Open Championship is the biggest tournament in golf and it sends out completely the wrong message for it to be held at clubs that don’t allow women members. ‘Sport’s governing bodies should be doing all they can to promote equality and address the sexism that still exists in some quarters, not turning a blind eye to it.’ Write highlights for this article.","completion":"Here are some key points from the complex article you shared: 1.

Summarize the following: Making sure your body is in top physical condition before labor begins can reduce the likelihood of a prolonged labor. Preparing your body for what's to come can make labor easier and quicker when your baby arrives. Walk or swim regularly, and incorporate a few specialized exercises. Kegels, small internal contractions of the pelvic muscles, can help your body with the pushing stage of labor and also reduce the risk of hemorrhoids in the weeks after childbirth. You can do kegels virtually anywhere. Simply contract the muscles around your vagina, as you would when holding in urine, then hold for four seconds and release. Repeat this 10 times. Three or four sets, done about three times a day, is ideal. The pelvic tilt, also known as the angry cat, can strengthen abdominal muscles and reduce back pain during pregnancy. Get on your hands and knees, keeping your arms straight without locking your elbows. Tighten your abdominal muscles when breathing in and move your buttocks below your back. Relax your back when you breathe out and repeat at your own pace. Move in time to the rhythm of your breath. Squatting helps open your pelvis, important for labor. Stand with a chair facing your back and, using the chair for support, contract abdominal muscles, lift your chest, and relax your shoulders. Lower your tailbone to the floor, as if you were going to sit down on the chair, and then rise again to the standing position. Making sure your body is healthy before delivery is vital to a smooth labor. Nutrition is just as important as exercise. Each woman's body is different, so there's no one-size-fits-all guideline to how much weight you should gain. The adage that you're eating for two is false as your caloric intake does not double. However, you should increase the amount of calories you're eating as your pregnancy progresses. In general, a woman with a BMI between 18.5 and 25.9 should gain between 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy. A woman with a BMI higher than this should only gain 15 to 25 pounds. Discuss how much weight you should gain with your doctor and know how much you should increase your caloric intake to achieve this goal. If you are pregnant with twins or multiples, you will probably need to gain more weight; discuss this with your doctor. Be sure you get plenty of fresh fruits and veggies. Focus on whole grains, such as oatmeal, whole wheat breads and pastas, brown rice, and barley. Incorporating dairy will give you plenty of potassium and calcium for you and your baby. Be careful with fats. Stick to heart-healthy fats found in avocados, nuts, and olive oil. Fruits and veggies high in vitamin C, vitamin A, iron, and folate are especially good for pregnant women. Try apples, oranges, green beans, spinach, sweet potatoes, pineapple, mangoes, and squash. Zinc is particularly important during pregnancy as its vital in cell development. Chicken, turkey, ham, shrimp, dairy products, beans, and peanut butter are all great sources of zinc. Eating fish can also be a great source of protein, but you should avoid fish that may have high mercury levels, such as swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish, and shark. When your contractions begin, stay calm so you're able to relax in between. This saves up energy for the later and more trying stages of labor. There will be continual breaks between contractions throughout labor. Take advantage of such respites, especially during early labor when contractions themselves are gentler. If possible, sleep between contractions. Practice deep breathing and other relaxation techniques. Have reading and viewing material on-hand so there's something present to distract you and help you relax during the process.","completion":"To reduce the likelihood of a prolonged labor, it is crucial to maintain physical fitness through exercises like walking, swimming, kegels, pelvic tilts, and squats. Nutrition is also vital; focus on whole grains, dairy, heart-healthy fats, fruits, vegetables, and zinc-rich foods, while avoiding fish with high mercury levels. Controlling weight gain and consulting with a doctor about individual needs ensures a healthier pregnancy journey.

Humm…you don’t categorize best as either fun or interesting so maybe I have one of each! Interesting one; while Clinton was still in office he was at a fund raising dinner at a restaurant I managed. I met his personal valet from the white house mess, Oscar, and he casually said, if you are ever in DC…. To which I replied, I sure can be! My husband and I made the trip a month or so later, we met up with Oscar for dinner on our first night there. We had just started planning all we wanted to see as it was our first visit there. We had no idea that Oscar would invite us for not one but two private tours of the White House. We saw the oval office, the situation room, the rose garden, the mess, the press room and the OEOB. We even heard Buddy bark! It was a trip I knew I’d never be able to repeat and was very grateful to have had the chance to take. For the fun one…My friend was turning 50 and she wanted a theme destination celebration. 18 of us went to Belize. She went all out. Two private villas that you could only access by boat, all the swag you can imagine. And plenty of booze. That alone is already a super special vacation but for me it had even more meaning. I’d never been invited to a group event like this before nor had I been to spring break, which this very much turned into. I know many people have plenty of over the top stories. And I’ve had some even more amazing trips than this. But those two had just enough special twists to make them really stand out. Thanks for asking. I too am a Disney fan!

During school,her parents took her to Italy to explore the country's many cultural treasures. One of the private art collections Isabella visited in Milan had a deep influence on her. She wrote to her friends about her dream of owning a house one day with an art collection like the one she had seen in Italy. In Paris, Isabella became a close friend of one of her classmates, Julia Gardner, whose family was from Boston. Julia would later introduce Isabella to her brother, Jack. In 1860, Isabella Stewart married Jack Gardner. The couple had too much art to fit inside their home. So they decided to start planning a museum. Mrs. Gardner didn't like the cold and empty spaces of many museums during her time. She wanted a warm museum filled with light. She once said that she decided years ago that _ . America was a young country developing quickly in other areas. But the country needed more chances for people to see beautiful examples of art.

Mrs. Gardner opened her museum on January 1,1903. The museum was then called Fenway Court. She invited her friends that night for a special musical performance. The next month, she opened the museum to the public. At first, visits were limited to twenty days out of the year. Visitors paid one dollar to enter. Isabella Stewart Gardner died in 1924 in Boston.

If The Galleria provides a sheltered, much trafficked pedestrian passage from the Duomo to another holy entity, the revered 18th-century La Scala theater, high temple of opera., can we conclude that \\"The Galleria is a famous theater.\\"?","completion":"The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, often referred to simply as \\"The Galleria,\\" is a historical and architectural landmark in Milan, Italy. While it is true that it provides a sheltered and bustling pedestrian passage from the iconic Milan Cathedral, or Duomo, to the renowned La Scala theater, asserting that \\"The Galleria is a famous theater\\" would be an inaccurate conclusion based on this information. The Galleria is primarily known for its distinctive architectural design, which features a soaring, iron-and-glass domed ceiling, elegant mosaic floors, and historic facades. Designed by Italian architect Giuseppe Mengoni in the 19th century, the gallery is named after Vittorio Emanuele II, the first king of the united Italy. The Galleria serves as an early prototype of the modern shopping mall and is home to a number of luxurious shops, cafes, restaurants, and even a luxury hotel. While the La Scala theater, an 18th-century neoclassical building widely regarded as one of the world's premier opera venues, resides near the Galleria, the latter does not function as a theater itself. The proximity between these two renowned locations serves as a testament to the cultural and historical significance of the area in Milan's city center, but it does not indicate that the Galleria plays a direct role in hosting theatrical performances or other similar events. In conclusion, defining the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II as a famous theater based on its connections to the nearby Duomo and La Scala would be a misinterpretation of its true function and purpose. It is better to identify the Galleria as a significant architectural treasure and an elegant shopping destination with a fascinating history, rather than attempting to categorize it as a theater."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Bolshoi ballet head Anatoly Iksanov replaced Anatoly Iksanov had a year left to run on his contract Continue reading the main story Related Stories The head of Russia's Bolshoi Theatre has been removed from his post, following a series of scandals including an acid attack on the ballet company's artistic director. Anatoly Iksanov is to be replaced by Vladimir Urin, the Russian culture ministry announced. The acid attack on Sergei Filin exposed vicious internal rivalries at one of the world's top ballet companies. Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky said the Bolshoi needed \\"renewal\\". \\"A difficult situation had developed around the theatre and the troupe - everything pointed to the need for renewal,\\" he said. Mr Iksanov had been accused of mismanaging the Bolshoi's 1bn (£860m) renovation - which ran years over schedule and over budget. He had also become embroiled in a war of words with dancer Nikolai Tsiskaridze. Mr Tsiskaridze, a principal dancer and teacher at the Bolshoi, complained of corruption and called for the theatre's entire management to be sacked and for himself to be put in charge. Nikolai Tsiskaridze demanded he be put in charge of the Bolshoi Mr Iksanov hit back, suggesting Mr Tsiskaridze might have played a role in inciting the attack on Mr Filin, which left him with severe burns to his face and almost completely blinded. Mr Tsiskaridze has denied having anything to do with the attack, for which three other people are awaiting trial. But he has been told his contract at the theatre will not be renewed. Mr Iksanov had been the head of the Bolshoi Theatre for the last 13 years, and had more than a year of his contract to run. Culture Minister Mr Medinsky said he would still have a role advising his successor, Mr Urin, who has been general director of the Stanislavsky Musical Theatre. Mr Urin \\"will be able to unite the troupe and continue the development of the best theatre in the country and one of the best in the world,\\" Mr Medinsky said. Commenting on his appointment, Mr Urin said \\"I don't plan any revolutions and understand perfectly that in this theatre, as in any other, one person alone cannot do anything. \\"I very much hope that the majority of people working in this theatre - talented, remarkable people - will be my allies,\\" he said. ||||| The Russian culture ministry on Tuesday fired the director general of the famed Bolshoi Theater that has been mired in scandal since an acid attack on its artistic director. FILE - In this March 19, 2013 file photo, Anatoly Iksanov , the general director of the Bolshoi Theater, speaks to the media in Moscow, Russia. The Russian culture ministry has fired the director general... (Associated Press) Anatoly Iksanov would be replaced by Vladimir Urin, head of another major ballet and opera troupe, the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Music Theater, said the culture minister, Vladimir Medinsky. He said that a \\"difficult situation at the theater\\" was the reason for the dismissal. Iksanov, however, was offered to work as Medinsky's adviser in the ministry. The Bolshoi has been shrouded in scandal for years but a fierce conflict erupted in January when an assailant threw acid into the face of Sergei Filin, the artistic director of ballet. In March, police arrested Bolshoi soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko over his involvement in the attack. Dmitrichenko admitted that he had agreed to an offer from an acquaintance to rough up Filin, but he insisted that the man had used acid on his own initiative. Despite Dmitrichenko's confession, many in the ballet company have stood by him, saying they do not believe him capable of staging such a crime. About 300 dancers and staff, led by principal dancer and Iksanov's key opponent Nikolai Tsiskaridze, signed an open letter claiming that Dmitrichenko had slandered himself under police pressure. The Bolshoi reopened in 2011 after a 1 billion renovation. Despite the lavish sums, some of the work was of poor quality, with cracks appearing in the walls and gold leaf crumbling away. Iksanov has been at loggerheads with many of the troupe's famous dancers, including Tsiskaridze who accused him of mismanaging the Bolshoi's reconstruction, ruining its repertoire and abusing dancers' rights. Iksanov and his backers have dismissed the criticism. |||||Summary:","completion":"Anatoly Iksanov, the head of Russia's Bolshoi Theatre, has been replaced by Vladimir Urin, according to an announcement by the Russian culture ministry.

This is especially true of minority or coalition governments who may face accusations that they do not have a mandate for certain policies , or situations where minority groups are exercising their right to self-determination .","completion":"The sentences provided appear to be discussing the concept of \\"Direct Democracy versus Representative Democracy.\\" Here's my step-by-step analysis: 1. The first sentence mentions laws \\"passed by public approval\\", which refers to a characteristic of direct democracy where people vote on policies directly. The phrase \\"less open to challenge\\" suggests an advantage of this system, as it can address issues around legitimacy and acceptance of laws. 2. The second sentence emphasizes the nature of the issues, describing them as contentious or controversial. In direct democracy, such issues can be addressed by public vote, ensuring that the result reflects the majority's viewpoint. 3. The third sentence points towards minority or coalition governments' difficulties in getting a mandate for certain policies. In a representative democracy, minorities can often feel unheard or misrepresented, raising questions about the system's fairness. By analyzing all these sentences put together, they seem to be discussing or debating the advantages and disadvantages of direct democracy against a representative democracy. This includes issues of public mandate, the ability to tackle contentious issues, and the representation of minority groups."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Make this lower case","completion":"Here's the instruction you provided, converted into lower case: \\"use your left and right arrow keys to move your ranger, the up arrow key to jump and the down arrow key to duck.\\" Just to give a bit more details to your request: These directions are typically used in many video games or other screen-based interactive modules where moving a character or navigating through the platform is required. Your left and right arrow keys are used to make your character move horizontally. Pressing the left arrow key will make your ranger move to the left on your screen. Similarly, pressing the right arrow key will make your ranger move to the right on your screen. These keys allow you to dictate the direction in which your character moves. The up arrow key is typically used to make your character jump. In the case of your ranger, pressing this key will cause them to leap off the ground and into the air. This can often be a crucial part of gameplay, as it can help your ranger avoid obstacles, reach higher platforms, or evade enemies. Finally, the down arrow key is generally associated with making your character duck or crouch. Pressing this key will cause your ranger to lower their stance. Ducking can be used for a variety of purposes within a game, such as dodging incoming attacks, sneaking under low barriers, or maneuvering through tight spaces. Remember, practice makes perfect. The more you get used to these controls, the more effective you will become at using them to navigate through the game and act strategically.

The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using DVD players. DVDs offer higher storage capacity than compact discs while having the same dimensions. - In computing and optical disc recording technologies, an optical disc (OD) is a flat, usually circular disc which encodes binary data (bits) in the form of pits (binary value of 0 or off, due to lack of reflection when read) and lands (binary value of 1 or on, due to a reflection when read) on a special material (often aluminium ) on one of its flat surfaces. The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate (usually polycarbonate) which makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer. The encoding pattern follows a continuous, spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track. The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine, and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more, depending on the drive type, disc format, and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc (inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed). Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves. This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material, usually lacquer. The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label, sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself. Unlike the 3-inch floppy disk, most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches, fingerprints, and other environmental problems. - Matthew Abram \\"Matt\\" Groening (; born February 15, 1954) is an American cartoonist, writer, producer, animator, and voice actor.

Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled. And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes.

As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

The autistic children were not helped by the clinic, but the school was helpful, as the Choose your answer from: * clinic lacked the proper educational resources. * school lacked the proper educational resources. Answer:","completion":"The autistic children were not helped by the clinic, but the school was helpful, as the clinic lacked the proper educational resources. The school provided an array of specialized services and accommodations tailored to meet the unique needs of the autistic students, equipping them with essential tools to overcome the challenges they faced in learning and socializing. Unlike the clinic, which focused primarily on addressing the medical and therapeutic aspects of autism, the school invested in creating an inclusive, nurturing, and supportive environment that promoted the development of foundational academic skills as well as vital social and emotional competencies. At the school, a team of dedicated educators and professionals, consisting of special education teachers, speech and language pathologists, occupational therapists, and behavioral consultants, collaborated closely to design and implement personalized and evidence-based educational programs for each autistic student. These programs incorporated various pedagogical approaches, such as Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), Social Stories, and TEACCH, which proved effective in enhancing communication, social interaction, problem-solving, and adaptive living skills in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Moreover, the school offered a variety of extracurricular activities and clubs, such as art, music, and sports, that catered to the diverse interests and abilities of the students and fostered their creativity, self-expression, and physical fitness. Additionally, the school emphasized the importance of fostering a culture of empathy, understanding, and acceptance within the broader school community. By conducting regular awareness campaigns, workshops, and professional development opportunities for staff, teachers, and students, the school sought to dispel common misconceptions and stereotypes about autism and encourage meaningful and positive interactions between neurotypical peers and autistic students. This helped to build a safe and supportive atmosphere, where all students felt valued, respected, and empowered to reach their full potential. In contrast, the clinic focused mainly on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of the medical and psychological aspects associated with autism, such as cognitive, language, motor, and sensory impairments, along with comorbid conditions like anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and sleep disturbances. Despite its role in providing essential healthcare services to autistic individuals, the clinic lacked the necessary expertise, infrastructure, and resources to address their educational needs effectively, thereby limiting its capacity to support their overall development and well-being. In conclusion, the school played an instrumental role in helping the autistic children by providing a holistic approach to their education, personal growth, and social inclusion. The educators and professionals at the school dedicated themselves to crafting individualized interventions and curriculums that empowered the students to thrive academically, emotionally, and socially, unlike the clinic, which primarily dealt with medical and therapeutic interventions. By recognizing and responding to the diverse and complex needs of autistic children, the school managed to significantly enhance their quality of life and equip them with valuable skills to navigate and succeed in an ever-changing world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money.

These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

These marriages were to leading actresses and personalities in the entertainment industry, with each marriage capturing significant media attention. 1. Mimi Rogers (1987-1990) Tom Cruise's first marriage was to American actress and producer Mimi Rogers. The two got married on May 9, 1987, after meeting through a mutual friend. Mimi Rogers, born Miriam Spickler, is best known for her roles in movies such as \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\" (1987), \\"The Rapture\\" (1991), and \\"Reflections in a Golden Eye\\" (1997). Rogers is also known for introducing Cruise to the Church of Scientology, which became an essential part of his life. Unfortunately, their marriage didn't last long, and the couple decided to part ways in 1990, finalizing their divorce on February 4 of the same year. 2. Nicole Kidman (1990-2001) Shortly after Tom Cruise's divorce from Mimi Rogers, he met Australian actress Nicole Kidman on the set of their film \\"Days of Thunder\\" in 1989. The two quickly fell in love and got married on December 24, 1990. This high-profile marriage attracted significant media attention, and the couple went on to star in several films together, including \\"Far and Away\\" (1992) and \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" (1999).

Given the question: Hormones control many cell activities, so they are very important for homeostasis, and homeostasis is the chemical equilibrium of the body. Given these facts, hormones control many cell activities and are important to what among the following options: - h2o - an organism's body - weather - increases a body's strength - production of energy - Transfers energy - maintaining density - chemical equilibrium of body The answer is:","completion":"Hormones control many cell activities and are important to an organism's body and the chemical equilibrium of the body. Hormones are chemical messengers that are secreted by various glands in the endocrine system. They travel through the bloodstream to target cells or organs in the body and regulate various physiological processes. These processes include growth and development, metabolism, immune function, and reproduction. Therefore, hormones are essential for the proper functioning and homeostasis of an organism's body. Homeostasis is the maintenance of a stable internal environment within the body, despite changes in external conditions. This involves the maintenance of a constant temperature, pH, and the concentrations of various ions and molecules in the body fluids. It is crucial for the survival and functioning of cells, tissues, and organs in an organism's body. Hormones play a critical role in maintaining homeostasis and chemical equilibrium in the body. For example, insulin and glucagon, hormones produced by the pancreas, work in a balanced manner to regulate blood glucose levels. When blood glucose levels rise, insulin is released, which stimulates the conversion of glucose to glycogen for storage. In contrast, when blood glucose levels drop, glucagon is released, triggering the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, thus increasing blood glucose levels. Another example of hormones maintaining homeostasis is the action of the antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which regulates water balance in the body. ADH is released from the pituitary gland when there is a decrease in blood volume or an increase in blood osmolarity. This hormone stimulates the kidneys to reabsorb water, allowing the body to conserve water and maintain proper hydration levels. Therefore, among the given options, hormones' importance lies in their role in controlling many cell activities and maintaining the chemical equilibrium of an organism's body. It is important to note that while hormones have various effects on the body, they do not directly control weather, increase a body's strength, produce energy, transfer energy, or maintain density."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"A: Vyvanse, also known as lisdexamfetamine, is classified as a central nervous system stimulant, specifically part of the amphetamine class of drugs. It is primarily prescribed for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children, adolescents, and adults. However, it is also sometimes prescribed off-label for other conditions such as binge eating disorder and narcolepsy. Vyvanse works by affecting the levels and activity of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, particularly dopamine and norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters are essential for processes like focus, attention, and impulse control. When someone has ADHD, they may have an imbalance in these neurotransmitters that can lead to inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity issues. Vyvanse helps to increase the levels of these neurotransmitters, thereby improving concentration, focus, and reducing hyperactivity in individuals with ADHD. As a prodrug, Vyvanse is different from other stimulants because it is inactive in its original form and needs to be metabolized in the body to become active. Once ingested, the body's enzymes break down the lisdexamfetamine into d-amphetamine, which is its active form. This metabolic process helps to provide a consistent and gradual release of the drug throughout the day, which can reduce the potential for abuse and addiction compared with other stimulants that have a more rapid onset of action. Despite the lower potential for abuse, Vyvanse is still classified as a Schedule II controlled substance in the U.S. under the Controlled Substances Act. This is because it has a high potential for misuse and addiction, as well as the potential for severe psychological or physical dependence. Therefore, it is important for individuals taking Vyvanse to follow their doctor's prescription instructions and never share the medication with others. Some common side effects of Vyvanse include dry mouth, loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, dizziness, irritability, and insomnia. Serious side effects can also occur, such as increased heart rate, high blood pressure, and psychiatric issues (including new or worsening symptoms of depression, anxiety, or aggressive behavior). It is essential for patients to talk with their healthcare provider about any side effects they may experience while taking Vyvanse. In conclusion, Vyvanse is a central nervous system stimulant belonging to the amphetamine class of drugs. It is primarily used for treating ADHD by affecting neurotransmitters, providing a slow-release effect through metabolic processes. Although it is a Schedule II controlled substance with the potential for misuse and addiction, the risks can be well-managed under proper medical supervision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

The choice of Budapest as the main filming location was due to its diverse architecture, which allowed it to stand-in for multiple locations and offer a unique atmosphere for the story. Some of the key locales and landmarks used in the movie include: 1. Budapest's Széchenyi Chain Bridge: The crucial car chase scene, featuring Bruce Willis maneuvering through heavy traffic and causing chaos, was predominantly shot on and around this famous Hungarian landmark. 2. St. Stephen’s Basilica: Surrounding areas and adjacent streets of this prominent neoclassical church were included in the film's sequences. 3. Miklós Bercsényi Barracks of MH 59th Military Base: This former military base served as the backdrop for the scenes featuring Moscow's CIA Safe House. It is situated in an industrial area of Budapest called Csepel. 4. Kemény-Zsigmond Mansion: This 19th-century mansion in Budapest was transformed into a luxurious Russian hotel for the movie's purposes, where John McClane and his son find shelter. Additional filming occurred at various locales throughout Budapest, including the Hungarian State Opera House, Kossuth Square, Népliget Bus Terminal, and Nagyszombat Street. The production also utilized the Origo Film Studio in Budapest for several interior sequences. It is important to note that a few scenes were actually filmed in Russia, particularly in Moscow's Red Square and at the Hotel Ukraina. However, these sequences were relatively short and served to enhance the movie's setting authenticity. In summary, A Good Day to Die Hard was primarily filmed in Budapest, Hungary, with occasional shots in Moscow, Russia. Hungarian locations skillfully doubled as Russian settings, contributing to the film's action-packed, international vibe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work. But . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all. According to the above context, answer the following question. After the end of the story: The answer is:","completion":"Based on the context provided, the Mediterranean Diet has numerous health benefits such as lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, and reduced risk of diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and diabetes.

However, the diet can be expensive due to the focus on fish, fresh fruits and vegetables, and nuts, which may cost more than fast food or junk food options.

(Photo: Craig Bailey, Florida Today) Story Highlights Rev. Al Sharpton calls verdict \\"an atrocity\\" NAACP urges Justice Department to pursue civil rights charges against Zimmerman Leaders appeal for calm Angry civil rights groups on Sunday were pressing for new criminal charges following George Zimmerman's acquittal on second-degree murder and manslaughter in a Florida courtroom. The NAACP website featured an online petition -- also posted on the liberal site MoveOn.org -- asking the Justice Department to bring federal charges against Zimmerman in the February 2012 fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. \\"The most fundamental of civil rights — the right to life — was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin,\\" the petition says. \\"We ask that the Department of Justice file civil rights (criminal) charges against Mr. Zimmerman for this egregious violation.\\" Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson issued a statement Sunday saying federal prosecutors were continuing to review evidence in the case, including testimony from the state trial. \\"Prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate,\\" Iverson said. Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, pressed for those charges, blasting the state verdict as a \\"tragic miscarriage of justice.\\" She also urged Trayvon's family to pursue a civil lawsuit. \\"No matter how you look at this situation, if it were not for the actions of Mr. Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin would still be alive with his family today,\\" Arnwine said. She said she hoped the verdict would spark a national conversation about racial profiling and the \\"broken criminal justice system.\\" After the verdict was announced Saturday night, a clearly shaken NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said, \\"This is a heartbreaking moment. This will confirm for many that the only problem with the New South is it occupies the same time and space as the old South.\\" NOT GUILTY: Zimmerman acquitted 'SYSTEM HAS FAILED': Crowds react to verdict He referenced another killing of a black youth that many have compared to the Trayvon Martin slaying, the 1955 killing of 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was killed in Mississippi for allegedly flirting with a white woman. \\"Trayvon Martin's case has focused a generation the same way that the Emmett Till case focused a generation 60 years ago. I had hoped that this time we would get a verdict that fit the gravity of the case.\\" The Rev. Al Sharpton, who led thousands of protesters in Sanford seeking a prosecution of Trayvon's killer, called the verdict \\"a sad day in the country\\" and \\"a slap in the face to those that believe in justice in this country.\\" \\"I think this is an atrocity,\\" Sharpton said. \\"It is probably one of the worst situations that I have seen.\\" Jesse Jackson called the verdict \\"Old South justice.\\" \\"I'm disappointed and I'm saddened for the family,\\" Jackson said. While the jury's verdict was a crushing blow for many, there were no reports of serious unrest by early Sunday morning. Authorities in Martin's hometown of Miami and in Miami Gardens, where his father lives, said the streets were quiet. Demonstrators took to the streets of four California cities, and there were reports of protesters breaking windows and damaging cars in Oakland, officials said early Sunday.

In Sanford, Tristan Bailey, 15, who was outside the Seminole County courthouse, was stunned after hearing the verdict. \\"I don't know what to say,\\" said the teen, who identifies with Trayvon Martin. \\"He was just a teen, trying to live his dreams.\\" Shannon Mickey, 41, was also disappointed. \\"We were all nervous when we knew the verdict was coming down,\\" Mickey said. \\"It was a sense of shock. And unbelievable sadness.\\" In Detroit, the Rev. Charles Williams II, president of the National Action Network of Michigan and pastor of Detroit's Historic King Solomon Baptist Church, said he planned a special prayer service at the church to pray for the Martin family. \\"In the South, it's still hard for an African American to get justice,\\" Williams said. \\"Mr. Zimmerman deserved at least manslaughter and the jury wouldn't even do that. There is not faith in the jurors or in the diversity of the process.\\" Williams said that National Action Network will examine legal options. \\"We're going to continue our calls for justice for Trayvon Martin,\\" he said. In Fort Myers, Fla., people voiced feelings of anger, dismay and concern about keeping the peace immediately following the verdict. \\"Oh my goodness, this is unreal to me. I'm very upset,\\" said Antoinette Anderson, 48, a school district employee who is African American. \\"It shows we're not equal in the justice system.\\" Joe D'Alessandro, a 74-year-old former state attorney who now has a private legal practice, had a different take: \\"I never thought the state had a second-degree murder case,\\" he said. \\"Self-defense trumps all. I just hope there's no violence.\\" Despite his disappointment with the verdict, Jealous urged calm. \\"It's important that the public focus on the fact that there are still additional avenues for holding this man accountable and bringing him to justice,\\" he said. \\"It is critical that people keep the peace and focus their energy on encouraging the federal authorities to make sure that Zimmerman is held accountable for taking young Trayvon Martin's life.\\" Jackson also called for calm. \\"I hope there will be dignity and discipline, and not street justice,\\" he said. \\"We cannot dishonor the innocent blood of Trayvon Martin with acts of violence.\\" Tampa resident Craig Woodord brought his 13-year-old son, Dante, to the courthouse Saturday afternoon to watch history in the making.

HolderSam Clovis is a terrible pick for the USDA Holder: Obama never asked me to consider dropping a case Schumer: Trump must withdraw USDA nominee to show he doesn't 'tolerate hate' MORE faces a crucial decision on whether to press federal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman, after the neighborhood watchman was acquitted Saturday in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin. The NAACP and other leading civil rights groups are pressing for Holder to open a federal case against Zimmerman, after he was found not guilty on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges by a Florida jury. ADVERTISEMENT The public pressure leaves Holder, the nation’s first African-American attorney general, facing a difficult decision on a controversial case that has grabbed the nation’s attention and sparked renewed debate about racial profiling. In a statement from NAACP President Ben Jealous, the civil rights group said they were “not done demanding justice for Trayvon Martin.” “The most fundamental of civil rights—the right to life—was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin. We ask that the Department of Justice file civil rights charges against Mr. Zimmerman for this egregious violation,” said the group in a petition unveiled Saturday night. “Please address the travesties of the tragic death of Trayvon Martin by acting today.” On CNN Sunday, civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson also demanded that the Justice Department “intervene” and “take this to another level.” Many Democratic lawmakers are also joining those calls, with Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) tweeting a message from Jealous asking for the DOJ to act. Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) tweeted he was “deeply saddened” by the verdict, but was “pleased that DOJ is continuing to evaluate evidence.” The DOJ launched a review of the shooting earlier this year and Holder said that they would take proper action if they had evidence of a civil rights crime. “If we find evidence of a potential federal criminal civil rights crime, we will take appropriate action, and at every step, the facts and law will guide us forward,” said Holder in a speech in April to Al Sharpton’s National Action Network. But Holder had cautioned in subsequent remarks that the DOJ faces a “very high barrier” when seeking to bring federal criminal charges in such cases. The decision to act against Zimmerman after a jury acquitted him could also put Holder again at odds with Republican lawmakers, with whom he has had a contentious relationship. The House voted him in contempt last year after he failed to turn over documents subpoenaed in a probe of the ATF’s botched gun-tracking program, Operation Fast and Furious. Holder has also faced congressional anger over the DOJ’s probe of journalists over national security leaks, including questions about whether he lied when testifying before Congress that he was unaware of efforts to prosecute reporters. Holder spoke in April about the shooting death of Trayvon Martin personally, saying that “as a parent, I reacted to it.” “This is a pain that no parent should have to endure. The notion of having to bury a child is something that is, I think in some ways for a parent, the ultimate pain,” Holder said. “The primary responsibility we have in the Justice Department is to support the state in its ongoing investigation, to do our own thorough and parallel investigation which we are in the process of doing and try to resolve this matter in as fair and complete a way and as quickly as we can.” ||||| Editor's note: The George Zimmerman trial: What happened? What's next? Watch an \\"Anderson Cooper 360\\" special tonight at 8 ET on CNN. (CNN) -- This might sound like a legal conundrum: A Florida jury has pronounced George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon Martin. But a court could still hold him accountable for the death. Martin's family so far has only commented that it wants the public to respect the Florida court's verdict. Two options, however, are available: A civil suit, or a civil rights suit. Though they sound similar, they are very different. A civil suit allows one party to seek monetary damages against another for causing physical or emotional harm, regardless of the outcome of a criminal trial. A civil rights suit involves criminal charges for violating someone's civil rights, which are protected under federal law. Feds are asked to act Civil suit Take what happened to O.J. Simpson 17 years ago. After a criminal court acquitted him of charges in the 1994 killing of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson, a civil court held him responsible in 1997 for her \\"wrongful death.\\" It ordered him to pay her family more than 33 million in damages. Various courts then stripped Simpson of every asset they could get their hands on. Wrongful death is easier to prove than murder or manslaughter. A defendant can be held liable, even if he or she didn't intend to cause the victim's death, according to Florida law. Simple negligence is enough, if it results in death. Did Zimmerman act negligently, when he exited his vehicle to pursue Martin on foot while carrying a gun -- although a 911 operator told him not to? Would the 17-year-old still be alive if Zimmerman had not done so? Those are questions a lawyer for Martin's family would be sure to ask in a wrongful death suit. Martin's family has so given no indication so far of wanting to pursue an additional suit. But someone else has. Trayvon's dad: My heart is broken, my faith is not Civil rights suit The NAACP is pushing the U.S. Department of Justice to file a civil rights suit. They accuse Zimmerman of racial profiling that led to Martin's death -- an allegation that Zimmerman, his family and his supporters have denied. Analysis: The role that race played \\"The most fundamental of civil rights -- the right to life -- was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin,\\" the group said. NAACP President Benjamin Jealous told CNN's \\"State of the Union\\" on Sunday that remarks made by Zimmerman and people who live in his Sanford, Florida, neighborhood had sparked the group's concern. \\"When you look at (Zimmerman's) comments, and when you look at comments made by young black men who lived in that neighborhood about how they felt especially targeted by him, there is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young Trayvon,\\" Jealous said. The NAACP leader's allegations drew sharp criticism Sunday from Robert Zimmerman Jr., who argued that FBI interviews have already shown that his brother isn't racist. \\"I don't think (Jealous) does anything for civil rights by perpetuating a narrative that has now been proven false. ... They've investigated I think about three dozen of his closest friends and acquaintances. And there is not any inkling of racism. In fact, there's evidence to show the opposite,\\" he said. \\"I would encourage them to cool their jets, give everyone some time to kind of process what's going on. Agitation doesn't help us. It doesn't do anybody any good right now.\\" The Rev. Jesse Jackson told CNN's \\"New Day\\" on Sunday that his Rainbow PUSH Coalition also wants the Justice Department to look into possible civil rights violations in the case. \\"There's a Trayvon in every town,\\" he said. \\"That's why the Department of Justice has a role to play, to look at this pattern, because equal protection under the law remains elusive.\\" The Justice Department did not respond directly to the NAACP demand. It has a separate federal investigation going on. \\"Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial,\\" it said in a Sunday statement. It's a legal path that worked in the case of Rodney King, whom Los Angeles police officers clubbed down in 1991 after a car chase. The beating of the African-American man was caught on video and later aired on news broadcasts. When a criminal court failed to convict the white officers of police brutality, riots ensued in Los Angeles over alleged racial discrimination. The Justice Department filed a civil rights suit against the officers, alleging racial profiling, and two were convicted in 1993 as a result. A court sentenced them to 30 months in federal prison. CNN's Catherine E.

Tried with iPod, terrible, a bit better with Droid II on tight base eq. They did sound good but generally lacked base and the power in powerful music like the new alice in chains and tool. They were fantastic for Shostakovich symphonies though, I think because the power of these are only resonant in the low range and not reliant on it. When I plugged the phones into myGemini PA-7000 Professional Preamplifier(which is awesome and on sale now fyi), these problems were completely fixed and the sound was fantastic and very powerful (with flat eq). Answer: OPTIONS: a). No. b). Yes. The answer is:","completion":"b). Yes. This product review is generally positive with a few caveats. The reviewer initially finds that the headphones don't perform well when used with standard portable devices like an iPod or Droid II, particularly when it comes to bass performance and power in music genres such as rock and metal. However, they do appreciate the headphones for their performance with classical music, specifically Shostakovich symphonies, as they believe the low range resonant power is better suited for these compositions. The reviewer's overall opinion of the headphones improves significantly when they connect them to a Gemini PA-7000 Professional Preamplifier. The headphones' bass and power issues are resolved, and the sound becomes fantastic and powerful, even with a flat equalizer setting. The reviewer also takes the time to recommend the Gemini PA-7000, mentioning that it is currently on sale. In conclusion, this product review is positive because the reviewer finds the headphones to be excellent when paired with the right equipment, such as a decent amplifier. Despite their initial issues with portable devices, the reviewer acknowledges the headphones' potential for great sound quality, making the review a positive one."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them.

His limousine driver and a witness to the arrest, Louis Goldblatt, described him as \\"genuinely dumbfounded by the whole affair.\\" Tour manager Eric Barrett said that he looked \\"as if there had been a plane crash\\". Hendrix biographers Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek described the incident as \\"a nightmare which ... plagued\\" him for seven months. According to Redding, \\"the bust knocked any positive feelings Jimi was holding onto out of him\\" and that he was in \\"agonised suspense\\" from the arrest until the trial. In 2012, Plummer wrote: \\"The real possibility of prison hung over Hendrix like a spectre ... a threat to his career and the cause of much brooding and rumination.\\" Journalist Charles Shaar Murray asserted that the incident jeopardized what he described as \\"Hendrix's increasingly fragile peace of mind\\". Two weeks after the arrest, Hendrix told Lawrence: \\"Whatever I have done ... getting hooked on heroin is not one of them.\\" He explained that his fear of needles discouraged him from using the drug and that having known junkies convinced him that it was not something he should get involved with.

Despite worries over the space agencies ability to pay for the project, officials said they have completed a rigorous review of the Space Launch System (SLS). Towering a staggering 384 feet tall, the Space Launch System (SLS) will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds. Scroll down for video. An artist's impression of the giant rocket taking off. Nasa doesn't have enough money to get its new, 12 billion rocket system off the ground by the end of 2017 as planned, federal auditors warned in July. The Government Accountability Office issued a report Wednesday saying Nasa's's Space Launch System is at 'high risk of missing' its planned December 2017 initial test flight. 'They can't meet the date with the money they have,' report author Cristina Chaplain said. She said it wasn't because the space agency had technical problems with the congressionally-required program, but that Nasa didn't get enough money to carry out the massive undertaking. 'We are on a journey of scientific and human exploration that leads to Mars,' said Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden. 'And we’re firmly committed to building the launch vehicle and other supporting systems that will take us on that journey.' For its first flight test, SLS will be configured for a 70-metric-ton (77-ton) lift capacity and carry an uncrewed Orion spacecraft beyond low-Earth orbit. In its most powerful configuration, SLS will provide an unprecedented lift capability of 130 metric tons (143 tons), which will enable missions even farther into our solar system, including such destinations as an asteroid and Mars. This decision comes after a thorough review known as Key Decision Point C (KDP-C), which provides a development cost baseline for the 70-metric ton version of the SLS of 7.021 billion from February 2014 through the first launch and a launch readiness schedule based on an initial SLS flight no later than November 2018. Conservative cost and schedule commitments outlined in the KDP-C align the SLS program with program management best practices that account for potential technical risks and budgetary uncertainty beyond the program's control. 'Our nation is embarked on an ambitious space exploration program, and we owe it to the American taxpayers to get it right,' said Associate Administrator Robert Lightfoot, who oversaw the review process. 'After rigorous review, we’re committing today to a funding level and readiness date that will keep us on track to sending humans to Mars in the 2030s – and we’re going to stand behind that commitment.' The biggest rocket ever made: The SLS will be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds. 'The Space Launch System Program has done exemplary work during the past three years to get us to this point,' said William Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for the Human Explorations and Operations Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. 'We will keep the teams working toward a more ambitious readiness date, but will be ready no later than November 2018.' Nasa has been testing small scale versions of the rocket amid fears it could be too loud. Four SLS RS-25 engines will be used to power the world's biggest rocket into orbit. 'A 5-percent scale model, including solid rocket motors, of NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) is ignited to test how low- and high-frequency sound waves will affect the rocket on the launch pad,' the agency said. 'The data collected from the tests will be used to help direct and verify the design of the rocket's sound suppression system.' Previous tests have shown that most ofthe acoustic energy being emitted from a rocket engines is concentrated in the low to mid frequency ranges. 'This may have the potential to damage structures or harm personnel in the immediate vicinity of the test stand.' a Nasa report warned. The SLS is set to become the largest rocket ever built, dwarfing the rockets that took man to the moon and paving the way for manned missions to Mars. Nasa today said it is about to start testing the engines for the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket - on the same stand that were used to perfect the Apollo rockets. Four engines, a modified version of the space shuttle main engine that powered missions into space from 1981 to 2011, will be used on the mega-rocket. 'This test series is a major milestone because it will be our first opportunity to operate the engine with a new controller and to test propellant inlet conditions for SLS that are different than the space shuttle,' said Steve Wofford, SLS Liquid Engines Element manager. Earlier this year Nasa signed a 2.8 billion contract with Boeing to build the giant rocket it is hoped will take us into deep space. How it compares: The SLS is larger than the Saturn rockets than launched man to the Moon. It will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today. Russia's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled. However construction of the first stage of Russia's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway.

Summarize the following: Locate a source for vegetable oil that has been used in cooking. Contact local fast food restaurants, cafeterias, hotels and other commercial food establishments to see if you can take their waste oil, or pay a very small fee for it. You may compete with rendering companies, who also pay restaurants to take used oil off their hands. Try a restaurant that sells a lot of fried food, like French fries or fried chicken, as they are very likely to have large quantities of used oil that they need to dispose of. Ask restaurants if they use canola or olive oil, as these are typically the best oils for creating biodiesel. Avoid hydrogenated oils, which are generally higher in Free Fatty Acids and cause problems in biodiesel production. You can buy new cooking oil from the grocery store, but using waste oil is less expensive and helps reduce waste that would otherwise end up in a landfill or in sewer pipes. Look at the oil you obtain to roughly determine its quality. It should look darker than fresh or unused vegetable oil, and will likely include small food matter left from the frying process. If the oil appears milky or cloudy, do not use it, as it is likely too high in water content and/or animal fats, which will interfere in the biodiesel production process. Make sure to follow the proper procedures to dispose of cooking oil that you do not use. Contact your local waste management company or ask the restaurant you obtained the oil from to find out how they safely dispose of the oil. Take any transparent plastic jug from juice, soda, or any other household product and pour your used oil into it for storage. Ensure that any storage jug is completely clean, dry, and free of any other residue or materials, including water. Use a container with a tight lid and no cracks or leaks. The oil may already have come to you in an acceptable container when you obtained it from a restaurant or other source. However, you will need several clean containers (at least 3) on hand for storing oil at each stage of the filtration process. Label oil containers, and all other materials used in biodiesel production, clearly. At this stage, you can label the oil as “used oil” or “unfiltered oil” in order to avoid confusion in later steps of the process.","completion":"To obtain used vegetable oil, contact local fast food restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, and other commercial food establishments, and offer to take their waste oil or pay a small fee for it.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Catacombs of Rome contain most of the surviving Christian art of the Early Christian period, mainly in the form of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi. They show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs. Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes. The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously St Peter's, Rome) over the burial places of martyrs who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church. The beliefs of many cultures, including Judaism and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, consider the dead ritually impure and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture). In the late Middle Ages, influenced by the Black Death and devotional writers, explicit memento mori imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the transi tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the Dance of Death and works like the Ars moriendi, or \\"Art of Dying\\". It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of Pope Urban VIII by Bernini (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy. As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in ossuaries where they might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the Capuchin Crypt in Rome or the Czech Sedlec Ossuary, which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones.","completion":"The Catacombs of Rome are a critical source for understanding the emergence of Christian iconography.

However, Christians initially avoided using iconic images of religious figures on these sarcophagi. Instead, they decorated them with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram, and later, narrative religious scenes.

Andy, Trevor, and Billy are childhood friends. As young adults, Billy sells drugs and Andy does deliveries for him. One night, Trevor delivers instead and gets busted by narcs. 5 years later, Trevor is released from jail and learns his girlfriend Laura is now with Billy. Trevor gets back with her and decides to rob a local mobster. Trevor wants some cash to buy Laura some gifts and Andy was told by some local mobsters that they are investing money with huge profits and he wants some cash to buy in. However, their robbery is very sloppy and the head mobster quickly figures out what happened. However, he and Andy's grandfather were good friends, so he tells Andy and Trevor that they can work off what they owe by smuggling stolen diamonds. Billy finds out what is going on and is mildly amused by it until he realizes that Trevor has gotten back together with Laura behind his back. He retaliates by convincing the mobsters that Trevor is a junkie and is stealing the diamonds that he is supposed to be delivering to supply his habit. He also convinces the diamond dealer that Trevor cannot be trusted with real diamonds and he gives him fake diamonds instead. When he delivers them to the mob, they quickly spot them as fakes and assume Trevor switched them. Billy figured by doing this, the mobsters would send a goon to kill Trevor and with him out of the picture, he could have Laura back with no blood on his hands.

Answer a question about this article: BYU has 21 NCAA varsity teams. Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the \\"Cougars\\", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on Sunday, as well as expelling players due to honor code violations. Beginning in the 2011 season, BYU football competes in college football as an independent. In addition, most other sports now compete in the West Coast Conference. Teams in swimming and diving and indoor track and field for both men and women joined the men's volleyball program in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. For outdoor track and field, the Cougars became an Independent. Softball returned to the Western Athletic Conference, but spent only one season in the WAC; the team moved to the Pacific Coast Softball Conference after the 2012 season. The softball program may move again after the 2013 season; the July 2013 return of Pacific to the WCC will enable that conference to add softball as an official sport.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.

As mentioned, lifestyle- and obesity-related diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent all around the world. There is little doubt that the increasingly widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has contributed to this development. The food processing industry is a major part of modern economy, and as such it is influential in political decisions (e.g., nutritional recommendations, agricultural subsidising). In any known profit-driven economy, health considerations are hardly a priority; effective production of cheap foods with a long shelf-life is more the trend.

Thus, the consumer is left with the choice between more expensive, but nutritionally superior, whole, fresh foods, and cheap, usually nutritionally inferior, processed foods.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there will be weaker earthquakes happens, how will it affect MORE/STRONGER earthquakes. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation – weaker earthquakes – can have an effect, both direct and indirect, on the process that leads to more intense or stronger earthquakes. The relationship between weaker earthquakes and stronger ones can be understood in the context of the seismic activity and stress accumulation in the Earth's crust. 1. Direct effects: Release of stress: Weaker earthquakes can sometimes release the built-up stress in the Earth's crust along faults or cracks. This release of tension reduces the chances of a more significant, stronger earthquake occurring in the same region as the stress has been partially or wholly discharged. However, this doesn't guarantee that a stronger earthquake won't happen, but it might delay or decrease the intensity of a future seismic event. Triggering of other earthquakes: Conversely, weaker earthquakes can sometimes increase the likelihood of a stronger earthquake. When a weak earthquake occurs, it can transfer stress to adjacent faults, causing an imbalance and concentrating tension in nearby areas. This transferred stress may cause the adjacent fault segment to be pushed closer to its breaking point, leading to a more substantial, more potent seismic event. 2. Indirect effects: Understanding fault network and interactions: Weaker earthquakes can provide valuable information about the fault network in an area, including the connections between different faults and how stress is transferred among them. Through the study of seismic activity, including weaker earthquakes, scientists can better understand the chances of stronger earthquakes occurring and manage their potential impacts more effectively. In summary, the perturbation of weaker earthquakes can have both direct and indirect effects on the process that leads to stronger earthquakes. Weaker earthquakes can either release built-up stress, mitigating the risk of stronger earthquakes, or transfer stress to neighboring faults, potentially triggering more significant seismic events. Additionally, the study of weaker earthquakes can help scientists better comprehend fault networks and interactions, contributing to our understanding of the likelihood of stronger earthquakes in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1933 Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced their way through three Warner Brother musicals that offered Depression era audiences a momentary distraction from their woes. Gold Diggers of 1933, 42nd Street and Footlight Parade were all set in the world of Broadway Theatre with basically the same theme of the show must go on. In addition to Keeler and Powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of Busby Berkeley, show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players. All are arguably classics of their genre but I must admit a clear preference for Footlight due to it's pace energy and lead James Cagney. Warren William in Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter in 42nd Street acquit themselves admirably as the shows production heads- particularly Baxter as the burned out Julian Marsh in search of one last box office smash. Both lack the infectious energy of Cagney however, who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a Broadway musical. He is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend. Of course Cagney alone does not make Footlight the classic that it is. The script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee and especially Joan Blondell who cuts everyone down to size. Busby Berkeley's dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and risqué and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the Hollywood Code in 34. Sadly, the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the verve and sass of Footlight again. Gentility and morality made sure of it. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"This review thinks positively of the movie Footlight Parade. The reviewer expresses a clear preference for Footlight over the other two musicals mentioned, praising its energy, pace, lead actor James Cagney, and supporting cast.

After receiving an unexpected phone call that she has won a spot to participate on a television game show, she becomes obsessed with regaining the youthful appearance she possesses in an old photograph. To reach her goal, she goes to a doctor to discuss weight loss. The doctor gives her a prescription for weight-loss amphetamine pills throughout the day and a sedative at night. As the months go by, Sara's tolerance for the pills adjusts and as a result she is no longer able to feel the same high the pills once gave her. When her invitation does not arrive, she increases her dosage from double to triple and, as a result, begins to suffer from amphetamine psychosis. Meanwhile, Sara's son Harry is young and has an adventurous life with his girlfriend Marion Silver and best friend Tyrone C. Love. He and his friends are all heroin addicts, and Harry funds his habit through petty theft, including from his own mother who turns a blind eye.

The idea that Earth is a magnet is far from new. It was first proposed in 1600 by a British physician named William Gilbert. Knowing it acts like a magnet is one thing. Knowing why it acts like a magnet is more difficult. In fact, finding out why is a fairly recent discovery. To find out why required new technology. It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here. It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal. The liquid metal moves as Earth spins on its axis.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What were the other names of the Monte Ne Hotel?, using the article: As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia. He was also going blind and needed younger people to read his letters and the newspaper to him., what would be the answer ?

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Where were infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century? In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

There's a 2% excess error made while measuring the side of a square, and we need to find the percentage of error in the calculated area of the square. Let's consider the original side length of the square is 's' units. Now due to the 2% excess error in measuring the side, the measured side would be: s' = s + (2% of s) s' = s + 0.02s s' = 1.02s Now, let's find the area of the square with the original side length 's' and the measured side length 's''.

These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers.

Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years. Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Hyun symbolically gives Yu a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance. Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. A senior Justice Department official told a House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on Thursday that several agencies including the FBI are investigating partisan political activity inside the IRS, and that former official Lois Lerner's disappearing emails are on the menu. A criminal investigation, Deputy Attorney General James Cole testified, 'is being conducted by career attorneys and agents of the Department’s Criminal and Civil Rights Divisions, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Cole declined to provide lawmakers with details about what the DOJ has uncovered. 'I can, however, tell you,' he added, 'that the investigation includes investigating the circumstances of the lost emails from Ms.Lerner’s computer.' Lerner, who led the IRS division tasked with vetting and monitoring tax-exempt nonprofits until her retirement late last year, is Republicans' central bête noire in the controversy over how her sub-agency targeted conservative groups with aggressive scrutiny and years-long delays when they applied for the coveted charitable status. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Deputy Attorney General James Cole told the House Oversight Committee on Thursday that the Justice Department's investigation into the IRS tea party targeting scandal includes a probe into Lois Lerner's missing emails. Lerner (R) headed the IRS division that policed nonprofit groups, and is accused of purposely targeting right-wing organizations for unusually intrusive scrutiny. Republicans on the oversight committee hit the roof when IRS Commissioner John Koskinen confirmed last month that years' worth of Lerner's government emails, which they had been demanding since 2013, were casualties in a hard drive crash. Koskinen drew gasps during a congressional hearing when he acknowledged that after forensic experts failed to retrieve the emails, the agency recycled the drive – rendering it permanently unavailable to investigators in the legislative branch of government. He also admitted, under questioning by Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, that the IRS failed to look at a backup tape that could have provided copies of Lerner's emails for a six-month period. Cole's statement on Thursday is the first indication that the Obama administration may have moved with purpose to probe what happened, despite the GOP's hints at a partisan slow-walk – or, worse, a cover-up in which Lerner herself destroyed evidence of her alleged wrongdoing. Lerner's attorney, William Taylor III, did not respond to an email seeking comment. On July 9 he released a statement claiming that his client 'did not destroy any records subject to the Federal Records Act, she did not cause the computer assigned to her to fail, and she made every effort to recover the files on the computer.' Although Republicans learned of the email losses in June, her hard drive crashed in 2011. Some Republicans believe the data loss as happened at too opportune a time to have been an accident: Just days earlier, the GOP had begun publicly questioning the IRS's partisan activity. That was two years before Lerner herself outed the program by answering a planted question at a conference for tax professionals in May 2013. Her admission presaged a report, long in the making, that the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration released days later. That same year, a surviving email shows, Lerner cautioned her colleagues and underlings to communicate via instant message instead of by email, because the latter would be open to congressional inquiries. Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan reacted to Cole's written testimony late on Wednesday, telling The Wall Street Journal that it was overdue. 'Finally, someone in the administration admits that the destruction of two years of emails from Lois Lerner is fishy,' Jordan said. Clash: Republican Rep. Darrell Issa (R) has continually crossed swords with Democrat Elijah Cummings (L) over the question of whether Lerner can claim Fifth Amendment privileges and refuse to testify about her agency's partisan activities. Like other Republicans, Jordan wants the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor instead of relying on its own lawyers to conduct the investigation. That seems unlikely, as Cole's appearance at Thursday's hearing appears calculated in part to quell conservatives' fears about the DOJ's impartiality. 'This whole thing is about Democrats in power abusing Republicans,' a senior staffer to an Oversight Committee Republican member told MailOnline on Thursday morning. 'Why would we trust that another agency in the same administration will behave any better?' Lerner raised the GOP's temperature at a May 2013 committee hearing when she offered a self-serving opening statement before refusing to answer questions, citing her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Attorneys working for the committee's GOP majority later determined that she had waived that right by offering an oral defense that wasn't subject to cross-examination. Republicans have since pushed a Contempt of Congress resolution through the House of Representatives, citing her refusal to answer questions while under subpoena. One conservative member, Steve Stockman of Texas, proposed last week that the House sergeant-at-arms should arrest her.

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - The Daytime Emmy Award is an American accolade bestowed by the New Yorkbased National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in recognition of excellence in American daytime television programming.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. I am facing a new situation today: Ben and Jerry were two friends with very different dietary habits. Jerry ate healthy food, and was always on top of his caloric consumption, while Ben overate because he loved fatty foods such as butter, bacon et al. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which friend was at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, the friend who is at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease is Ben. The reasoning here is that, according to the background article, high dietary lipid intake can lead to unhealthy weight gain and increased levels of lipids in the blood which in turn can increase risk for cardiovascular disease. Ben overeats with a preference for fatty foods like butter and bacon. These foods are likely to be high in lipids including the concerning saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. Overconsumption of these can lead to the issues described in the article in the long-term, including arterial narrowing, atherosclerosis, and an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, Jerry eats healthily and monitors his caloric intake closely, indicating a lower lipid intake and therefore, a lower risk for cardiovascular disease. These habits are more in line with mitigating the risks described in the background article. Therefore, considering these points, it is fair to say that Ben is at a higher risk."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:My first memory of cooking was with my grandmother, Rosemary, in Sydney. She taught me how to make scrambled eggs on her electric stovetop, the kind with the coiled heating elements, in her small, linoleum-lined kitchen with cupboards that stuck a little when they closed. She was not an exceptional cook — I can remember plenty of bland and overcooked vegetables and custard made with powder to pour into pre-bought pie cases with tinned pineapple, her specialty — but she worked hard to put a balanced, home-cooked meal on the table three times a day, every day. The eldest of eight children, she dropped out of school during the Depression to help her single mother look after her siblings and work as a seamstress at David Jones. When the Second World War broke out and she was engaged to my grandfather, Aubrey, she started working on war-torn planes (“sometimes looking as if a steam roller has gone over them,” she said) as a sheet metal worker, putting them back together, when many of the men who used to do this work were off fighting the war. She said it was just like dressmaking, only using different materials. She had a twinkle in her eye and a distinct laugh that can really only be described as a cackle. She was a strong, incredibly smart woman with a fighter spirit who led her female co-workers out on the airport tarmac one day on a strike to earn equal wages to men. I am so proud that her story is taught as part of the Australian primary school curriculum. Her dream was to have a home with that electric stove. In 1943 when she was 28 she was interviewed for Australian Women’s Weekly magazine for an article on women in men’s jobs during the war, where there is a photo of her that is etched in my memory, dressed in white, wearing a white bandana tied in a knot at the top of her dark curls, a plane behind her. What was Grandmother, Rosemary's dream?

Here is a question about this article: Canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as Venezuelan extra-heavy and Mexican heavy oil in chemical composition, and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through oil pipelines to the refinery. Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and refined asphalt without any preprocessing. This is particularly common in areas such as the US Gulf coast, where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil, and in areas such as the US Midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined. Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower, and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline. By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non-upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over 1.3 million barrels (210×10^3 m3) per day, of which about 65% was exported to the United States.

I finally left at about 11p.m.. I drove home slowly because the wind was blowing and it was raining heavily. I was running into our road when a man suddenly ran in front of my car. I almost hit him but I stopped just in time. I was scared and the man looked scared, too. I got out of the car but he ran away before I could ask if he was all right. It was very strange. When I got home, the lights were on but it was very quiet. I called to my wife but there was no answer. Then I remembered that she was out at a concert. I was still very unhappy about what happened on the road, so I made myself a drink. Then I went upstairs to have a bath. I saw that the window in the bedroom was open.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who showed a Continental influence in his use of the Dutch gable? Another major influence in his work was the rise of interest in vernacular architecture. By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white revival using half-timbering was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere. The black-and-white revival did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality. The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T. A. Richardson and James Harrison and it came to be developed mainly by T. M. Lockwood and by Douglas. Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white. Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the Tudor style. These include tile-hanging, pargetting and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries.A characteristic of Douglas's work is his attention to both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his joinery, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a Dutch gable. The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building.

Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about scientific method — that of the problem of induction. Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past. Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by inductive reasoning that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.\\"? Answer:","completion":"1. What was Hume's perception on the establishment of all knowledge, even the most fundamental beliefs about the natural world? Hume maintained that all knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about our natural world, could not be conclusively determined by reason alone. According to Hume, our beliefs are more a result of accumulating habits over time, which are developed in responses to our collection of sense experiences. Therefore, our knowledge and beliefs are not solely influenced by logic and reason, but are greatly influenced by familiar patterns and routine experiences. 2. Explain Hume's perspective on inductive reasoning and its justification. In Hume's view, inductive reasoning poses a problematic situation. He argued that in order to reach the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, one requires to employ inductive reasoning itself. Thus, the justification for inductive reasoning becomes a circular argument, trapped within its own logic and methodology. This essentially points to a challenge in the validation of inductive reasoning, rendering its clear justification an issue. 3. What does Hume's problem of induction imply about our ability to predict future events? According to Hume, the problem of induction limits our capacity to predict future events with absolute certainty. He believed that there exists no guarantee that the future will always mirror the past. As an example, he posited that although we expect the sun to continue rising from the East because it has done so in the past, we can't be certain of this by relying on inductive reasoning alone. Reasoning that future events will be similar to past ones is a product of our habitual thinking, formed from repeated past experiences, and it does not assure us of their occurrence in the future. 4. How does Hume's argument shift the debate about the scientific method? Hume added a pivotal slant to the deliberation about the scientific method by indicating the problem of induction. By arguing that the premises for inductive reasoning rely on inductive reasoning itself, he disrupted a widely accepted belief in scientific methodology - the reliance on inductive reasoning to predict and establish theories. This can be seen as questioning the certainty and reliability of scientific conclusions drawn purely based on inductive reasoning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Calvin Veltman undertook, for the National Center for Education Statistics and for the Hispanic Policy Development Project, the most complete study of English language adoption by Hispanophone immigrants. Mr Veltman's language shift studies document high bilingualism rates and subsequent adoption of English as the preferred language of Hispanics, particularly by the young and the native-born. The complete set of these studies' demographic projections postulates the near-complete assimilation of a given Hispanophone immigrant cohort within two generations. Although his study based itself upon a large 1976 sample from the Bureau of the Census (which has not been repeated), data from the 1990 Census tend to confirm the great Anglicization of the US Hispanic American origin population. What is Calvin Veltman' study about?","completion":"Calvin Veltman's study is about the adoption of the English language by Hispanophone immigrants in the United States. The study was conducted for the National Center for Education Statistics and the Hispanic Policy Development Project. Veltman's research focused on documenting the rates of bilingualism and the subsequent preference for English among Hispanics, especially targeting the younger generations and those born in the United States. Through a series of demographic projections, the study postulates that a given Hispanophone immigrant cohort would be nearly completely assimilated into American society within two generations. The basis of Veltman's study was a large sample from the Bureau of the Census in 1976. Although the sample has not been repeated, the 1990 Census data tends to confirm the significant Anglicization of the US Hispanic American origin population. Thus, the study offers valuable insights into the language shift and assimilation patterns among Hispanophone immigrants in the United States, highlighting the prevalence of English language adoption and its role in facilitating the integration of these immigrants into the broader American society."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: In the computer age, most of us take a broadband Internet connection for granted. Whether cable or mobile broadband, today's connections are many times faster than those in the early days. Videos play smoothly, complex websites load quickly, and files download much faster than ten years ago. And the files are much bigger too. There's _ , of course: You have to live near enough to a major city to get broadband Internet. If you don't, it's slow dial-up access for you. And for those living really far out, there may be no Internet access at all. Technology experts often talk about the \\"last mile\\" problem, which refers to the difficulty of bringing Internet access to remote locations. In cities and suburbs, it's relatively easy to provide access for everyone. It is much more difficult to deliver access to those living far from cities, especially in developing countries. Internet service providers, for their part, have been reluctant to provide access to sparsely populated areas. The handful of Internet users they would reach wouldn't cover the expense. But every year, technological advancements allow of more and more Internet users. Most broadband connections today run over existing cable TV and telephone lines although these technologies aren't available everywhere. Some companies have delivered the Internet over standard power lines. Advancements in cheaper, more efficient fiber optics cables promise to bring extremely fast Internet connections to more users. Still, the \\"last mile\\" problem remains hard to deal with. There will always be somewhere that doesn't have an affordable broadband connection. But someday that might not matter.

British tuner Kahn reveals the Flying Huntsman pickup British tuner Kahn has done many things to many Land Rover products in the past â some tasteful, some rather less so. Here is the company's latest, the Flying Huntsman 105 Pick Up. As you have correctly deduced, the definitely-not-hilariously-mispronounceable Huntsman started life as a Defender pick-up, but - as with the other also-definitely-not-hilariously-mispronounceable Flying Huntsman - gets a lengthened nose. That bonnet is 400mm longer than the standard Landie's, together with an increase in width of 150mm. There are also wider, extended front and rear fenders with vents and apertures, new headlights, a new front bumper with lights, side vents, a \\"captivating gold stripe\\" and matte black 18-inch wheels. In fact, the whole thing is finished in matte black, too. Underneath, there's Land Rover's 2.2-litre diesel engine - the 105-horsepower version - and unspecified brake and suspension upgrades. Kahn says it has upholstered many things inside the cabin - there's no image of the interior, perhaps thankfully - and fitted a 'Churchill' clock and rev counter fascia, machined aluminium pedals, a billet steering wheel and two ‘GTB' sports seats. Prices start from £58,875 (about 89,000). A cruel thing to do to the venerable Defender? Or curiously appealing? A version of this story originally appeared on TopGear.com.

Sentence 2: The Green Mile appeals to the audience's self-congratulatory instincts. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"If the first sentence were to be considered semantically valid, rather than being an aggressive, subjective statement, then one could argue that the second sentence is true given the context provided in the first sentence. The first sentence metaphorically refers to \\"The Green Mile\\" as a \\"fat old whore\\" likely to convey the idea that it is a pandering and manipulative piece of work. The statement suggests that \\"The Green Mile\\" appeals to the audience's self-congratulatory instincts by stroking their ego, making them feel better about themselves, even if this approach may cause them to lose touch with reality (illustrated metaphorically as \\"going blind\\"). The second sentence is a summarization of the idea presented in the first sentence, stripped of the inflammatory language. It states that \\"The Green Mile\\" appeals to the audience's self-congratulatory instincts, which is a more neutral way of conveying the idea. In essence, if one takes the intention behind the first sentence – the notion that \\"The Green Mile\\" is a piece of work that panders to the audience's self-congratulatory instincts – as a valid observation, then the second sentence is true, as it reflects this idea in a more concise and neutral manner.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"While the suggested answer provides a brief overview of the different categories of prostitution, it does not directly address the question \\"What states have legalized prostitution?\\" Therefore, you should not validate the answer as it does not provide the requested information. To answer the question properly, as of now, in the United States, prostitution is illegal in all states except for parts of Nevada. Nevada has specific laws governing the industry, and prostitution is restricted to licensed brothels. It is important to note that this does not mean that prostitution is legal throughout the whole state. The law only permits legalized prostitution in counties with a population of less than 700,000 residents and where local governments have opted to legalize brothels. Some of Nevada's most populous counties, including Clark County (where Las Vegas is located) and Washoe County (where Reno is located), have outlawed prostitution. Outside of Nevada, U.S. states continue to treat prostitution as an illegal activity under both federal and state level laws. However, some local jurisdictions have taken steps to decriminalize or reduce penalties for individuals engaged in the sex trade, which can include sex workers and their clients. For example, in 2021, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance announced that his office would no longer prosecute prostitution and unlicensed massage cases. In summary, prostitution is officially legalized only in certain parts of the state of Nevada. Other states and local jurisdictions may implement various policies related to the decriminalization or tolerance of prostitution, but that does not make it fully legal within those locations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although part of a prominent family with strong ties to its community, Dickinson lived much of her life in reclusive isolation. After studying at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst. When she was eighteen, Dickinson's family befriended a young attorney by the name of Benjamin Franklin Newton. According to a letter written by Dickinson after Newton's death, he had been \\"with my Father two years, before going to Worcester - in pursuing his studies, and was much in our family.\\" Although their relationship was probably not romantic, Newton was a formative influence and would become the second in a series of older men (after Humphrey) that Dickinson referred to, variously, as her tutor, preceptor or master. Newton likely introduced her to the writings of William Wordsworth, and his gift to her of Ralph Waldo Emerson's first book of collected poems had a liberating effect. She wrote later that he, \\"whose name my Father's Law Student taught me, has touched the secret Spring\\". Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of tuberculosis, he wrote to her, saying that he would like to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw. Biographers believe that Dickinson's statement of 1862--\\"When a little Girl, I had a friend, who taught me Immortality - but venturing too near, himself - he never returned\\"--refers to Newton. Dickinson was familiar not only with the Bible but also with contemporary popular literature. She was probably influenced by Lydia Maria Child's Letters from New York, another gift from Newton (after reading it, she gushed \\"This then is a book! And there are more of them!\\"). Her brother smuggled a copy of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Kavanagh into the house for her (because her father might disapprove) and a friend lent her Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre in late 1849. Jane Eyre's influence cannot be measured, but when Dickinson acquired her first and only dog, a Newfoundland, she named him \\"Carlo\\" after the character St. John Rivers' dog. William Shakespeare was also a potent influence in her life. Referring to his plays, she wrote to one friend, \\"Why clasp any hand but this?\\" and to another, \\"Why is any other book needed?\\" Ask a question about this article.","completion":"What was the significance of Benjamin Franklin Newton in Emily Dickinson's life and her development as a poet?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They were one of the first mastodon species that emerged after the extinction of the Dinosaurs. The fossils of the Paleomastodon have been discovered in parts of Africa with the majority of significant findings in Egypt. Paleomastodons were medium-sized proboscidean mammals that had a distinct shape compared to their cousins, the mammoths, and modern elephants. A few major differences included the tusks; Paleomastodons had long, curved upper tusks in addition to smaller straight lower tusks. These tusks were used as tools to strip off bark from trees or dig in the ground for roots and other vegetation. On their skull, they had low but elongated bony crests, which were used for attachment of strong muscles needed to carry the massive head and large tusks. Their molars were also different from modern elephants; Paleomastodons had uniquely shaped teeth that could grind a wider variety of plants, including leaves, twigs, and aquatic plants. The diet of Paleomastodon was highly diverse, which was one of the crucial factors for their long survival and success during the Tertiary period. Paleomastodon's body weight is estimated to have been around 4 tons. They were shorter and slightly stockier compared to modern elephants, and their legs were comparatively shorter. Their trunks, while similar in use to modern elephants' trunks, were not as dexterous, since they lived in a different environment and their lifestyle did not require such agile trunks. Research and study of Paleomastodons provide valuable information about the evolution and adaptation of these mammals through millions of years. Their fossils also help us understand the changing environments and the variety of ecosystems they inhabited throughout their existence. As we continue to unearth more fossilized remains, we expand our understanding of the incredible diversity and development of these fascinating creatures, as well as their role and impact on the ancient world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Monroe was born on his family's farm near Rosine, Kentucky, the youngest of eight children of James Buchanan \\"Buck\\" and Malissa (Vandiver) Monroe. His mother and her brother, Pendleton \\"Pen\\" Vandiver, were both musically talented, and Monroe and his family grew up playing and singing at home. Bill was of Scottish heritage. Because his older brothers Birch and Charlie already played the fiddle and guitar, Bill Monroe was resigned to playing the less desirable mandolin. Monroe's fortunes began to improve during the \\"folk revival\\" of the early 1960s. Many college students and other young people were beginning to discover Monroe, associating his style more with traditional folk music than with the country-and-western genre with which it had previously been identified. The word \\"bluegrass\\" first appeared around this time to describe the sound of Monroe and similar artists such as Flatt and Scruggs, the Stanley Brothers, Reno and Smiley, Jim and Jesse, and the Osborne Brothers. While Flatt and Scruggs immediately recognized the potential for a lucrative new audience in cities and on college campuses in the North, Monroe was slower to respond. Under the influence of Ralph Rinzler, a young musician and folklorist from New Jersey who briefly became Monroe's manager in 1963, Monroe gradually expanded his geographic reach beyond the traditional southern country music circuit. Rinzler was also responsible for a lengthy profile and interview in the influential folk music magazine Sing Out! that first publicly referred to Monroe as the \\"father\\" of bluegrass. Accordingly, at the first bluegrass festival organized by Carlton Haney at Roanoke, Virginia in 1965, Bill Monroe was the central figure. The growing national popularity of Monroe's music during the 1960s was also apparent in the increasingly diverse background of musicians recruited into his band. Non-southerners who served as Blue Grass Boys during this period included banjo player Bill Keith and singer/guitarist Peter Rowan from Massachusetts, fiddler Gene Lowinger from New York, banjo player Lamar Grier from Maryland, banjo player Steve Arkin from New York, and singer/guitarist Roland White and fiddler Richard Greene from California.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is less pollution happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, let's break down the volcanic eruption process and examine if pollution plays a role in it. Step 1: Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - Various gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, are trapped beneath the Earth's surface. These gases are produced by geological processes, and their accumulation can lead to an increase in pressure. Step 2: The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - As the pressure beneath the Earth's surface increases, it becomes sufficient to push the magma towards the surface. The movement of magma depends on factors like the viscosity of the magma and the presence of cracks or faults in the Earth's crust. Step 3: The magma cools - When the magma reaches Earth's surface, it is called lava, and it starts to cool down. The cooling process solidifies the lava, forming new landmass and volcanic rock. Step 4: With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - As geological processes continue, pressure builds up beneath the Earth's surface again, and the cycle repeats, possibly leading to another eruption. Step 5: The resulting volcano may explode - If the pressure buildup reaches a critical point or if there is a sudden decrease in pressure in the volcano's chamber, it can result in an explosive eruption, releasing a large amount of ash, gas, and pyroclastic materials. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis: If there is less pollution, how will it affect smaller eruptions? Pollution, in general, has minimal direct effect on the geological processes or factors that influence volcanic eruptions. Pollution is mainly a byproduct of human activities, like burning fossil fuels, and its effects on the atmosphere, climate, and ecosystems may affect climate patterns and global temperatures, among other things. However, these changes in climate and temperature do not have a significant impact on the processes that lead to volcanic eruptions. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggesting that less pollution would lead to smaller or less frequent volcanic eruptions is not supported by the available evidence. The processes leading to volcanic eruptions are primarily geological and influenced by factors that are not affected by pollution levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dr Tony Cole said the Liverpool Care Pathway scandal would not have been exposed without the Daily Mail and a free Press. A leading medical figure who helped abolish the Liverpool Care Pathway has praised the Daily Mail’s campaign as he condemned attempts to fetter the free Press. Dr Tony Cole – who persuaded ministers to set up the official inquiry that led to the demise of the LCP – said: ‘We would never have got it off the ground if it had not been for the Daily Mail and the Press. I am very concerned about freedom of the Press and anything which might endanger it.’ Dr Cole spoke in the wake of the proposal by ministers that newspapers should accept a new regulator which gives MPs a final say in how regulation should work. Newspapers are thought likely to reject the plan by Culture Secretary Maria Miller because they fear it would give politicians power to censor and intimidate the press. Dr Cole, a prominent paediatrician, praised the Mail in a speech at the Royal College of Medicine on Saturday. He said the Press had stood up for truth while the Government and the medical profession closed ranks to try to silence criticism of the Liverpool Care Pathway. ‘Had it not been for the Press, the relatives who have suffered would not have been able to link up and get their stories heard,’ Dr Cole said. ‘That’s why you need a free Press.’ During the summer the Government changed its mind and abolished the LCP following the verdict of Baroness Neuberger’s inquiry. The inquiry found patients and their families were suffering ‘poor care, appalling communications and of a lack of attention or compassion’. The inquiry was set up after the Mail made a series of damaging disclosures about the system, which had been introduced across the NHS hospital network, and which was meant to provide dignity and comfort to patients in their last hours of life. The Government abolished the LCP after an inquiry into standards of care prompted by the Mail's investigations (file picture) This newspaper highlighted the disquiet of senior doctors who thought the LCP was being used to get rid of elderly patients and free up hospital beds. We reported the agony of families whose loved ones had died, usually after being drugged and refused liquids. The Mail also revealed the ‘bribe’ system under which hospitals were paid millions in bonus money in return for hitting targets for numbers of patients dying on the LCP. The official inquiry said in July that desperate patients were being denied water and there were suspicions that patients had been ‘hastened towards death’ for financial reasons. It said the LCP should be abolished. Dr Cole, a member of the Medical Ethics Alliance which campaigns against euthanasia and abortion, was one of two senior medical figures who persuaded Lib Dem Health Minister Norman Lamb to establish the Neuberger inquiry. He said: ‘In this business we have come up against the entire establishment – the Government, the Royal Colleges, the bulk of the medical profession, all closing ranks – and we came in for a fair amount of stick for having actually questioned the LCP. Newspapers are thought likely to reject the regulation plan by Culture Secretary Maria Miller (pictured). Dr Cole expressed concern at any rules that would impinge on the freedom of the Press. ‘But had it not been for the Press, the. relatives who have suffered would not have been able to link up and get. their stories heard. ‘And their stories were absolutely dreadful – people were dying of thirst, people were being rendered unconscious unnecessarily, some very emotionally upsetting things were happening. That’s why you need a free Press.’ Dr Cole spoke as he received the Schindler Prize from disability rights campaigner Baroness Campbell for his work to expose the effects of the LCP. He added: ‘The British Medical Journal published a report that most GPs supported the LCP, but the Press were publishing more and more stories of awful deaths. ‘If I may say so, the demented elderly who were in great danger from the misapplication of the LCP, are now in a safer place. We must all acknowledge the importance of the Press in all of this from their first description of the so-called “death pathway”.’ Dr Cole told the Mail yesterday: ‘The medical establishment were trying to silence criticism. Damn right they were. Health Minister Norman Lamb called the LCP a 'national disgrace' The medical profession condemned the Daily Mail’s disclosures about the Liverpool Care Pathway.A string of professional bodies and charities combined with NHS managers to form a front to isolate and shout down our coverage of the Pathway. On September 24 last year, 22 organisations, including professional associations and the NHS End-of-life Care Programme, united to issue a ‘consensus statement’ endorsing the LCP. ‘Published misconceptions and often inaccurate information about the Liverpool Care Pathway risk detracting from the substantial benefits it can bring to people who are dying and their families,’ it said. On October 18, Royal College of General Practitioners council chairman Dr Clare Gerada said: ‘The RCGP is appalled at the media coverage in the Daily Mail and elsewhere about planning for end-of-life care. 'As well as being inaccurate and deliberately misleading, this coverage is creating unnecessary distress and fear for patients who might be nearing the end of their life and for their families.’ The Lancet, which describes itself as ‘one of the world’s leading medical journals’, said: ‘The reporting of the story has been appalling.’ In July this year, the inquiry set up by the Department of Health found the treatment of many patients on the LCP had been ‘uncaring, rushed and ignorant’ and called for its abolition. Health Minister Norman Lamb agreed, saying: ‘This is not civilised. It is a national disgrace.’ On the day the inquiry reported, Dr Gerada put out a new statement, saying her Royal College ‘supports the move away from the end-of-life pathway’ and adding: ‘We have expressed concern about the implementation of the LCP.’ ‘They were not willing to contemplate any possible criticism. I can remember one chap from a Royal College telling me that he knew hospital registrars were getting it wrong, but that was no reason for them to change their minds.’ Dr Cole, who retired last year after serving as a hospital paediatrician in London and Worcester, spoke as the row over Press regulation appeared to be reaching a crisis. Ministers have rejected a proposal for self-regulation put forward by newspapers that would incorporate the recommendations of Lord Justice Leveson in his inquiry into the culture, practice and ethics of the press. They prefer a system agreed by the political parties in a late night meeting in the offices of Labour leader Ed Miliband, at which several representatives of the anti-Press campaign group Hacked Off were present, but no representative of the newspaper industry. The regulation method proposed by Mrs Miller would be imposed by Royal Charter. It would allow the system to be amended by a two thirds majority in Parliament. Newspapers have indicated they will reject the scheme, which would mean statutory controls on the Press for the first time in 300 years. Documents from GCHQ leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden (pictured) were reportedly copied on to a USB memory stick and sent by FedEx. The Guardian newspaper reportedly sent top-secret files to the US by household courier FedEx in a move security experts branded ‘astonishing’. Former anti-terror law watchdog Alex Carlile QC said the suggestion that the paper used the courier may have put the lives of British spies in danger. He said: ‘I think it is astonishing that top-secret material has been placed in a public parcel delivery system.’ He also called on the Attorney General to consider legal action against the newspaper and accused the Guardian of playing a ‘parlour game’ with national security. Last week, the head of MI5 warned that publishing confidential documents handed a ‘gift’ to terrorists and caused harm to the work of security services. Security chiefs are ‘very concerned’ at the reported use of the courier service. A source said: ‘Any leak like this is extremely concerning and part of that concern is the handling arrangements.’ Documents from GCHQ, the Government’s secret listening post, leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden, were reportedly copied on to a USB memory stick and sent by FedEx.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a new situation: Ants are one of the most interesting creatures on earth. David wants to study ants for his biology project. He is specifically interested in ant species Acromyrmex heyeri. This semester he studied this ant in Americas. First day when he studied the ants the temperature was 10 degree Centigrade. In the second day of his study the temperature rose to 25 degree Centigrade. In the third day of his study the air humidity was high. But in the fourth day of his study air humidity dropped. David wants to continue his study of this same ant species in Asia next semester. But I can use this background: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. What is an answer for this question: Which day David would see more openings in the nest thatch, first day or second day?","completion":"Based on the information provided, David is likely to see more openings in the nest thatch on the second day of his study. On the first day, the temperature was 10 degrees Centigrade, which is below the range of 20-30°C where Acromyrmex heyeri ants are known to typically create more openings in their nest thatch as a form of temperature regulation. On the second day of his study, the temperature rose to 25 degrees Centigrade, which falls within the range of temperatures where these ants would create more openings in the nest thatch for regulating the internal nest temperature. Thus, David can expect to observe more openings in the nest thatch on the second day when the temperature is higher."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which battle day group A would have more openings in their nest thatch, battle day three or battle day four? Hint: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, we need to determine in which battle day group A would have more openings in their nest thatch considering the conditions provided for each day and the hint about Acromyrmex heyeri ants. Step 1: Analyze the temperature factor for each battle day. - Battle day one: Group A territory had a temperature of 5 °C, which is below the temperature range mentioned in the hint (20 – 30 °C temperature) where ants create more openings. - Battle day two: Group A territory had a temperature of 22 °C, falling within the specified temperature range. Step 2: Analyze the humidity factor for each battle day. - Battle day three: Group A territory had low air humidity. The hint indicates the ants will close the openings to reduce water loss in such conditions. - Battle day four: Group A territory had high air humidity. There is no mention of how this humidity level would impact openings in the nest thatch, but it does not involve the need to close openings. After analyzing both factors, we can conclude that: - In battle day one, the ants would not create more openings due to low temperature. - In battle day two, the ants would create more openings because the temperature falls within the specified range. - In battle day three, the ants would close openings due to low air humidity. - In battle day four, there is no information regarding the nest thatch openings, but it does not involve the factor that leads to closure.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. At one stage, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament, after the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834.\\", answer the following question.

A potential investor is scheduled to see Jarrod that very evening.Bruce Allison (Phillip Tonge) and Sidney Wallace (Paul Cavanagh) arrive and are given a brief tour of the wax museum.

Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth.

The government won't say what that something is, but Sweden's press is reporting the military is looking for a submarine, maybe a Russian one. Speculations are running rampant, fueled by the tense political climate and the uncertain nature of the potential threat. With the media providing a steady flow of information, the public's imagination is captured by the possibility of a foreign submarine entering Swedish waters. Though officials haven't confirmed any specific details, the Swedish military is already deploying troops, ships, and helicopters to patrol and search the Baltic region. It seems that the government is taking the threat of a foreign submarine intrusion very seriously. Locals share their concerns as national security is at stake, prompting an upswing in discussions about military spending and attitudes toward international relations. Despite the Swedish government's reluctance to disclose details about the possible underwater intruder, further reports indicate that evidence points to a possible Russian submarine. Tensions between the neighboring countries have been escalating in recent years, due in part to Russia's military actions in Crimea and Ukraine. The incident in the Stockholm archipelago is a stark reminder of the ever-present risk of naval encounters between Russia and Sweden. For Lasse Schmidt, the situation continues to be a surreal and nerve-wracking experience. The public eye is on him and his small decommissioned military sub, a curious and unexpected turn of events.

Preserving sugar differs from gelling sugar, also called jam sugar, because the latter contains pectin while preserving sugar is 100% sugar. Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supported by the text: is jam sugar the same as preserving sugar? Choose your answer from: a). no b). yes","completion":"a). No Jam sugar and preserving sugar are not the same, as there are differences in their composition, purpose, and usage. The key distinction between these two types of sugars lies in the presence of pectin, a crucial ingredient in determining their functions and outcomes in various food preparations. Preserving sugar is essentially 100% sugar, without any additives or other ingredients. It is primarily used in the preservation of fruits and other food items, where it acts as a sweetening agent and helps in maintaining the texture and quality of the preserved food. Preserving sugar typically consists of larger sugar crystals that dissolve slowly, preventing the formation of foam or scum during the cooking process. This ensures a clearer appearance and even distribution of sugar throughout the finished preserve. It is commonly used in the preparation of simple preserves, pickles, and chutneys, where no additional thickening or gelling agents are required. On the other hand, jam sugar, also known as gelling sugar, contains pectin as one of its primary components. Pectin is a natural carbohydrate found in the cell walls of fruits, and it functions as a gelling agent to help set jams, jellies, and marmalades. When combined with sugar and heated, pectin forms a gel-like structure that is responsible for the thick, spreadable consistency of fruit preserves. Jam sugar usually contains a mixture of sugar and pectin, and may also include additional components like citric acid to help increase acidity and promote the gelling process. This type of sugar is best suited for making jams, jellies, and marmalades from fruits that are low in pectin, as it provides the necessary setting agent for the final product. In conclusion, jam sugar and preserving sugar are not the same. While both types of sugars are used for the preparation of fruit preserves and other food items, the presence of pectin in jam sugar sets it apart from preserving sugar. This key ingredient provides jam sugar with the unique property of promoting the gelling and setting process in the preparation of jams, jellies, and marmalades, while preserving sugar serves as a sweetening agent without any thickening capabilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Math Problem Solve 11*x + 1074 = 1085 for x.","completion":"This problem is a simple linear equation of the form ax + b = c, where a = 11, b = 1074, and c = 1085. The user wants to find the value of x which satisfies the equation. Here are the steps to solve it: Step 1: Set up the equation. We have the equation 11x + 1074 = 1085. Step 2: Isolate x. In order to find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 1074 from both sides of the equation, which gives us: 11x = 1085 - 1074. Step 3: Execute the operation on the right side of the equation. Subtracting 1074 from 1085 gives 11. So the equation is now: 11x = 11. Step 4: Divide by the coefficient of x. In order to completely isolate x, we now divide both sides of the equation by 11, the coefficient of x: x = 11 / 11. Step 5: Solve for x. Dividing 11 by 11 gives us 1. Therefore, the solution to the equation 11x + 1074 = 1085 is x = 1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes.

Inclusion of religious beliefs whether they are conventional or new age are incompatible with the standards of objectivity one would expect in publications involving personal medical matters. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","completion":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer appears to express dissatisfaction with the content of the book and questions the author's credibility due to their reliance on occult practices such as astrology and tarot card readings. The fusion of alternative beliefs and personal medical matters seems to be the root cause of the disapproval. The reviewer's main concern is the incompatibility of religious beliefs, whether conventional or new age, with the standards of objectivity expected in publications involving personal medical matters. This concern stems from the belief that incorporating religious or spiritual ideologies into medical discussions could potentially lead to misinformation, bias, or a diluted understanding of the subject matter. The unflattering portrayal of the product is further reinforced by the reviewer's decision to return the book. This action suggests that the content was so bothersome that the reviewer could not continue reading or engaging with the material. Such a strong reaction implies that the book might not meet the expectations of readers who seek objective information on personal medical matters.

Let's solve the equation step by step and find out the value of x that makes it true. Here's the equation we need to solve: 0 = 124*x - 14*x - 1070 - 2560 First, let's add the \\"x\\" terms together. We have 124*x and -14*x. When we combine them, we get (124 - 14)*x which is 110*x. So, the equation becomes: 0 = 110*x - 1070 - 2560 Now, let's add the numbers without an \\"x\\" together. We have -1070 and -2560. When we add them, we get -1070 + (-2560) = -3630. So, the equation becomes: 0 = 110*x - 3630 Now, we need to isolate \\"x\\" to find its value. To do this, let's add 3630 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 3630 = 110*x - 3630 + 3630 3630 = 110*x Now, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 110 to find the value of x: 3630 / 110 = 110*x / 110 33 = x There you go!

A high school student, Timmy, is reading about elements of a periodic table. He is studying the periodic table when he decides to compare two random elements within the same column. He chooses Mardine and Sampline to compare and contrast and gets to work. The first thing he notices is that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. It's not much information to go on, but it's a good starting point for Timmy. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Is electron shielding higher or lower in Sampline? Hint: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Electron shielding is higher in Sampline. Step-by-step justification: 1. Timmy is comparing Mardine and Sampline, which are in the same column of the periodic table. 2. Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. 3.

Article:Trailing 1-0 from last week's first leg in Bucharest, Chelsea took the lead on the night through Juan Mata's close-range finish. But a scrambled effort from Vlad Chiriches before the break left Rafael Benitez's side needing two goals. John Terry pulled one back with a header then Torres produced a fine finish before missing a late penalty. After battling back from two goals down against Manchester United last weekend to secure an FA Cup replay, Chelsea were once again made to do it the hard way. But last season's Champions League winners showed plenty of patience to grind Steaua down. John Terry's last nine goals have all been scored at Stamford Bridge. Captain Terry has been used sparingly by Benitez because of an ongoing knee problem and he has not started a Premier League game since 2 February. But his goal set up the comeback before Torres, who only had an FA Cup goal against Brentford to show for his previous 19 games, drove in a third, although there was frustration when he failed to take another chance from the spot. For all the negativity that has surrounded the Stamford Bridge club this season, they still have two chances for silverware. But they had to dig deep to make it past Laurentiu Reghecampf's team. Steaua began with all the confidence of a team 12 points clear at the top of the Romanian table and were unfortunate not to move ahead when Raul Rusescu was played in behind the Chelsea defence only to see his shot turned wide by Petr Cech. The home side finally imposed themselves when a deep cross from Eden Hazard found John Obi Mikel at the far post and his shot was pushed away by Ciprian Tatarusanu. England: Chelsea, Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur Italy: Lazio Portugal: Benfica Russia: Rubin Kazan Switzerland: FC Basel Turkey: Fenerbahce Quarter-final draw to be made on Friday. Just after the half-hour mark they made the breakthrough when Mata drove forward and swapped passes with Ramires before stabbing a shot with enough power to get through Tatarusanu's legs. But in first-half added time, the visitors responded when a Iasmin Latovlevici corner was met by Cristian Tanase, whose shot was pushed on to the woodwork by Cech only for Chiriches to squeeze in at the near post to leave Chelsea needing two goals. Chelsea struggled for fluency at the start of the second period but just before the hour, an unmarked Terry headed in off the post from a Mata free-kick to give the home side hope. Cech was worked again when he palmed away from Alexandru Chipciu's looping effort. But Chelsea came up with a decisive third goal when Mata drifted in from the right and his pass was helped on by Hazard before Torres guided a shot into the corner. With five minutes remaining, Hazard was brought down in the area by Alexandru Bourceanu but Torres hit the bar with the resulting penalty. Full Time The referee brings the game to a close.

There are two cities, Chien and Marisol, in France that are leaders in the amount of wine they export to the rest of the world. Although they both export the same amount of wine, they use different sources of power to generate their electricity. Chien uses coal to power the city and Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation. Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

I remember a certain Tuesday, the morning of 18/6/02 to be exact. I was dozed off, trying to convince myself to get out of bed when a horrific explosion was heard. I went to the kitchen where I have a view of several neighborhoods in the southern Jerusalem and saw a pillar of smoke rising from a distant point, the sight of the smoke was followed a minute later by the waling of sirens. I remember rushing to my bedroom, taking out my binoculars, racing back to the kitchen and spotting the image of a glass shattered bus. The bus was still near the pick up station where a terrorist boarded on it and with a single click on a TNT device, murdered 25 passengers, many of whom were on their way to school. The wife of a good friend of mine, sat on the bus at the back row, a seemingly arbitrary and meaningless decision that saved her life. I'm sure that every Israeli has at least one terror-related memory he wishes he never would have had and it was only a matter of time before someone made a film about it. As it turned out, the movie was about to become a repressed memory of its own. The film is about a play-write on a dry run, Haim Buzaglo (portrayed by, hmmm, Haim Buzaglo who also wrote and directed the film) that spends the better part of his day conducting staring contests with his blank word processor page. In the meantime, his girlfriend, a field reporter for the Israeli commercial channel, decides to make a piece about a debt ridden ex-army officer. Buzaglo, bored and a bit paranoid due what is medically known as the \\"what on earth this hot babe is dating me\\" syndrome, asks a private eye to conduct a stakeout on his girlfriend. As the detective progresses in his investigation, his observations are permeating into the play and later on, to the lives of its actors. In the meantime, the play metamorphoses from a comic play into an indictment against the aloofness of the Israeli society. As for the movie, well, the movie becomes an exercise in frenzy editing, ensconced in its petty cardboard characters and unreliable dialogs while drifting miles away from the subject it was supposed to deal with in the first place. When I say \\"cardboard characters\\" I refer to the characters that under the writer/director's obsession for a \\"meaningful\\" film, were devoid of any genuine dialogs and any shred of reliability. I won't elaborate too much about it. Suffice to say that I'm sure that homeless barefoot male prostitutes rarely go the theater. With the intention to see a play, that is. This movie, according to Haim Buzaglo himself is the first part of a current agenda trilogy. I sincerely hope that the other two films will be derived from the experiences like the one I wrote about in the beginning of my review as opposed to the secluded world of characters that are anything but existent and a plot that is anything but compelling. 4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter.

This is a tongue in cheek movie from the very outset with a voice-over that pokes fun at everything French and then produces a rather naif but very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe. Portrayed by the splendid Gerard Philippe, the dashing young man believes utterly in the fate curvaceous Lollobrigida foretells - notably that he will marry King Louis XV's daughter! Problem is, La Lollo soon find outs she too is in love with Fanfan... Propelled by good sword fights, cavalcades, and other spirited action sequences the film moves at a brisk pace and with many comic moments. The direction is perhaps the weakest aspect but the film is so light and takes itself so un-seriously that I could not give those shortcomings a second thought. Look out for Noel Roquevert, a traditional heavy in French films, trying to steal La Lollo, making himself a nuisance, and feeding the script to the fortune teller that reads La Lollo's hand! And what a gem Marcel Herrand is as the megalomanous and lust-driven King Louis XV! That is not all: So many beautiful women in one film makes me wish I were in France and on the set back in 1952! The film may have come out that year but its verve, cheek, superb narration, immaculate photography and the memorable Gerard Philippe ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to watch.

The reviewer seems to enjoy the comedic and satirical nature of the movie, indicating a liking for the humor and tone of the movie right from the start. 2. The protagonist is described as brave, suggesting a positive view of the main character, while other characters such as Noel Roquevert and Marcel Herrand also receive praising mentions. 3. The user highlights multiple aspects of the film they enjoyed, including the sword fights, spirited action sequences, and numerous comic moments. 4. The reviewer's main critique of the film is its direction, but they dismiss this as minor compared to their overall enjoyment of the movie. 5. They express personal desires like wishing they were on the set back in the 1950s, which suggests a positive emotional reaction to the film. 6. They note that despite the film coming out in the past, it still holds up today, showing that they see it as timeless and continuously enjoyable. 7.

Homes look different in different countries.They also have different things inside.For example,in cold northern Europe,there's a fire in the living room or kitchen and all the chairs face it.In the south,where the sun shines a lot and it's more important to keep the heat out,there are small windows and cool stone floors.

Governments of Republic of Turkey since that time have consistently rejected charges of genocide, typically arguing either that those Armenians who died were simply in the way of a war or that killings of Armenians were justified by their individual or collective support for the enemies of the Ottoman Empire. Passage of legislation in various foreign countries condemning the persecution of the Armenians as genocide has often provoked diplomatic conflict. (See Recognition of the Armenian Genocide) Who ruled Turkey when the Armenian genocide happened?","completion":"When the Armenian Genocide happened, Turkey was ruled by the Ottoman Empire, specifically under the leadership of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), also known as the Young Turks. The Armenian Genocide took place during World War I, between 1915 and 1923. Three prominent figures known as the \\"Three Pashas\\" were the main architects and ruling triumvirate of the Ottoman Empire during this period. They were: 1. Mehmed Talaat Pasha (1874-1921): Talaat served as the Grand Vizier (equivalent to a Prime Minister) and Minister of Interior during the Armenian Genocide. He played a crucial role in implementing the orders for the deportation and subsequent massacre of the Armenian population. 2. Ismail Enver Pasha (1881-1922): Enver was the Minister of War (equivalent to a Defense Minister) and a military strategist for the Ottoman Empire. He often collaborated with Talaat Pasha in designing policies and proposing actions against the Armenian population. Enver was also instrumental in allying the Ottoman Empire with Germany during World War I. 3. Ahmed Djemal Pasha (1872-1922): Djemal served as the Minister of the Navy and the Governor of Greater Syria, which also included Palestine, Jordan, and Lebanon. He was the third member of the ruling triumvirate and was responsible for implementing the orders of Talaat and Enver Pasha regarding the Armenian Genocide in the regions within his jurisdiction. The Young Turks came into power after the 1908 revolution, which sought to modernize and democratize the Ottoman Empire. However, their initial promise of political and social reforms, including ethnic and religious equality, gradually transformed into an oppressive and nationalist regime that targeted the non-Turkish and non-Muslim populations of the empire. This led to various atrocities, culminating in the Armenian Genocide. During the Armenian Genocide, an estimated 1.5 million Armenians were systematically deported, tortured, and killed as the Ottoman Empire pursued its policy of ethnic cleansing. The genocide began on April 24, 1915, with the arrest and execution of Armenian intellectuals and community leaders in Istanbul, followed by the forced expulsion and mass killings of Armenian men, women, and children throughout the empire. Despite the overwhelming evidence and historical consensus on the Armenian Genocide, subsequent Turkish governments have continued to deny its occurrence and its genocidal intent. The recognition and condemnation of the Armenian Genocide by foreign governments and international institutions remain an ongoing issue today, often straining diplomatic relations between Turkey and other countries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","completion":"5) Church members - only saved people (Ephesians 2:21; 1 Peter) The phrase refers to the Christian belief that members of the Church consist of those individuals who have been \\"saved,\\" or who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. This belief is supported by verses from the New Testament of the Bible, specifically Ephesians 2:21 and 1 Peter. Ephesians 2:21 (New International Version) states: \\"In whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord.\\" This passage emphasizes that believers in Christ, when unified, form the Church or 'holy temple' that worships God. It suggests that the members of this holy temple are those who have been \\"fitted together\\" by accepting Christ's salvation and coming together in faith. In 1 Peter (the exact verse from which the text is taken is not provided), the author affirms that Christians are being built together into a spiritual house. Given the context of the initial phrase, it is likely referring to 1 Peter 2:5, which reads: \\"You also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.\\" This verse not only reaffirms the concept of believers forming the Church but also introduces the idea of believers becoming a \\"holy priesthood,\\" further embellishing the notion that members of the Church are those who have received salvation through Christ. In summary, the translated phrase \\"Church members - only saved people (Ephesians 2:21; 1 Peter),\\" highlights a fundamental teaching within Christianity emphasizing that the Church comprises those who have been saved through their faith in Jesus Christ. This salvation leads them to become part of a unified 'holy temple' or a 'spiritual house' that worships and serves God according to the teachings of the New Testament."},{"prompt":"Question: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point.

Only certain handguns are true \\"sporting weapons\\", seen as such by the sport's lovers. On the other hand, shooting at tin cans and other small objects in one's backyard is not and should not be considered a serious sport. When uncontrolled, it can be a very dangerous practice. Some opponents of handgun control have stated that we are out to stop all hunting and that controlling the handgun would severely affect hunting. That is simply untrue. Handgun control would in no way limit the freedom of the true hunter. Few if any hunters consider the handgun an effective hunting weapon. There are a few hunters who do hunt with handguns, but most states place restrictions on the type of guns that can be used in hunting, the reason is that killing of game should be done in as humane a way as possible. Some small handguns are more likely to wound the animal rather than kill it at once. Only long guns, rifles and shotguns are effective arms of hunting. People must understand that handguns and hunters are separate matters. Because most of the hunters use a rifle or shotgun, there is no reason why their search for game and sport should be affected by handgun control. Mixing the anti-hunting matter with the handgun matter confuses the killing of animals with killing of people. Question: In the writer's opinion, people should use handguns only when _ .

Please answer this question: when did the oregon trail game come out?","completion":"The Oregon Trail game was first released in 1971, developed by three student teachers, Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger. The game was initially created as an educational tool for an American history course, focused on the 19th century pioneer experience. The Oregon Trail game was designed to teach school children about the realities of 19th-century pioneer life on the Oregon Trail, which was the main route taken by settlers traveling from the Eastern United States to Oregon Territory. The game presented players with various challenges, such as managing resources, facing diseases, and handling unpredictable weather, which were meant to simulate the hardships faced by pioneers during their journey. The initial version of the game was created using the programming language BASIC and was played on a teletype machine. It was shared on the Minneapolis Public School system's timeshare computer system, which allowed the game to spread across other schools in Minnesota. In 1974, Rawitsch joined the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC) and, with the help of its employees, made improvements to the game. The first major release of the game came in 1978 in the form of a revised, text-based version for the Apple II computer. The Apple II version was distributed by MECC throughout schools in America, gaining wide popularity among educators and students alike. The game underwent several iterations throughout the years, with graphical updates, improved user interfaces, and additional gameplay elements being added. A popular and widely recognized version, The Oregon Trail Deluxe (featuring graphics, sound, and mouse support), was released in 1992 for DOS and Macintosh. The Oregon Trail game brand continued to evolve with time, even getting adaptations for mobile platforms and featuring 3D graphics in more recent installments. Overall, The Oregon Trail game has remained a significant part of American pop culture and education for more than five decades, inspiring a whole generation of learners about the challenges faced by early American pioneers during westward expansion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the initial narrative, Terry is identified as someone who was dating a model, and he was thoroughly enjoying this aspect of his life. However, an abrupt turn of events occurs when his model girlfriend calls him and brutally informs him that he isn't \\"good enough\\" for her. This declaration culminates in Terry getting dumped by his model girlfriend. As a result of this break up, Terry can indeed no longer claim that he is dating a model.

She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room.

Title: Legends of the Fall Movie plot: This is a wonderful yet heartrending period piece, as told by an elderly Native American through a collection of family letters he accumulated and saved over time.The right and proper Colonel William Ludlow, (Anthony Hopkins), a veteran of the Native American wars that took place in the late 19th century, has grown tired of the carnage and futility of war. Moreover, he detests the governments and their greed that propagated the battles he has fought. In the opening sequence, the teepees have been struck, the fires, billowing white smoke as they symbolically die out, along with the hope and freedom of \\"the People.\\"At first glance, the viewer might believe he is observing the remnants of the Colonel's last battle. Then a child is seen by his side, and the mood changes as the realization that the look in his eyes is not one of the victor, but that of sadness as he has come to know and respect the People, and forcing them from their home has brought him to his breaking point. He tosses his saber and sheath into the ground in disgust, viewing his humbled former enemy, and turns his back to the camera, and on his former life. The scene is similar to \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" in that the Native Americans, those who survived, are seen defeated and disheartened, abandoning what was once their home. The look on the \\"victorious\\" Colonel's face as he views his one time enemies says it all.Hopkins takes his wife, (Cristina Pickles) three sons, (Brad Pitt, Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas), and trusted Cree guide, One Stab, (excellent perfomance by Gordon Tootoosis, who also narrates), and his family on a quest to \\"lose the madness over the mountains and begin again.\\" Although filmed almost entirely in British Columbia, the setting for the film is the mountains near Helena, Montana. The scenery alone is reason enough to let yourself become lost in this film; temporarily lost from the madness.The story unfolds as the boys are still in their teens, and the youngest of the three, Samuel, (Thomas), is constantly watched over...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: I envy Chris Borland. My first encounter with Chris was in the fall of 2011, when Penn State faced Wisconsin in what was both of our sophomore seasons. I recall thinking that he was the best linebacker I had ever faced, and throughout my entire collegiate career this held true. Chris was a tough, instinctive, downhill linebacker with great leverage who was never afraid of contact. These past few days, I’ve heard many opinions on Chris and his decision to retire from the NFL at the age of 24 due to concerns about long-term brain injury. These opinions range from songs of praise calling Chris one of few football players with any sense, to words of derision describing him as soft. The latter couldn’t be farther from the truth. Chris was one of the toughest football players I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing against. Naturally, I believe that I have a certain insight into this dilemma, due to my non-athletic pursuits. In particular, I have a Bachelor’s and Master’s in mathematics, all with a 4.0, and numerous published papers in major mathematical journals. I am a mathematical researcher in my spare time, continuing to do research in the areas of numerical linear algebra, multigrid methods, spectral graph theory and machine learning. I’m also an avid chess player, and I have aspirations of eventually being a titled player one day. It is a simple truth. Playing a hitting position in the NFL can’t possibly help your long-term mental health. With all of these interests outside of the sport, I am often asked why I play football, how I feel about brain injury, and if that’s something I think about. This question has come up in NFL combine interviews, media interviews, and even in casual conversation with fans or fellow mathematicians. It can range from the very tame “You have such a bright future; aren’t you afraid of hurting your brain?” to the much more direct “You’re a fool for playing football, where are your parents?” I can assure you, I have received both ends of the spectrum and everything in between. It’s not rude to ask. It’s not some taboo topic that offends. It is a simple truth. Playing a hitting position in the NFL can’t possibly help your long-term mental health. However, it’s also true that how bad such a pursuit is for you is something that, I believe, no one really knows for sure right now. With that said, why take the risk? Objectively, I shouldn’t. I have a bright career ahead of me in mathematics. Beyond that, I have the means to make a good living and provide for my family, without playing football. I have no desire to try to accumulate 10 million in the bank; I already have more money in my bank account than I know what to do with. I drive a used hatchback Nissan Versa and live on less than 25k a year. It’s not because I’m frugal or trying to save for some big purchase, it’s because the things I love the most in this world (reading math, doing research, playing chess) are very, very inexpensive. I’m not playing for the money… I play because I love the game. I love hitting people. My mother was always supportive of whatever endeavors I wanted to pursue. But this is not the life she wanted for me. I can remember all the way back to when I started playing football in high school. At the end of every season my mother would tell me that I’ve played enough football, that it was okay for me to call it quits. She would tell me that I have such bright things on the horizon, that I don’t need to play. This past fall I finished my 10th season of football, and, as usual, this offseason I had this conversation with my mother for the 10th time. What my mother and a great majority of my friends, family, and fellow mathematicians don’t understand is that I’m not playing for the money. I’m not playing for some social status associated with being an elite athlete. No, the media has not brainwashed me into thinking this is what real men do. I play because I love the game. I love hitting people. There’s a rush you get when you go out on the field, lay everything on the line and physically dominate the player across from you. This is a feeling I’m (for lack of a better word) addicted to, and I’m hard-pressed to find anywhere else. My teammates, friends and family can attest to this: When I go too long without physical contact I’m not a pleasant person to be around. This is why, every offseason, I train in kickboxing and wrestling in addition to my lifting, running and position-specific drill work. I’ve fallen in love with the sport of football and the physical contact associated with it. Simply put, right now, not playing football isn’t an option for me. And for that reason, I truly envy Chris Borland. ||||| SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email John Urschel, an offensive lineman for the Baltimore Ravens, recently co-authored a paper in the Journal of Computational Mathematics. It is titled \\"A Cascadic Multigrid Algorithm for Computing the Fiedler Vector of Graph Laplacians\\" and apparently includes \\"a cascadic multigrid algorithm for fast computation of the Fiedler vector of a graph Laplacian, namely, the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue.\\" I understand close to none of the words in that sentence, which comes from the paper's abstract.

Summarize this article: The series, which became a national talking point when it began in 2000, has been resurrected by Channel 5. In April it was announced that the broadcaster had signed a two-year deal with the show's creators Endemol. Gaining notoriety for Nasty Nick's deceit in the first series, sexual encounters among housemates and romances which were later played out in glossy magazines, the programme was initially a huge hit for Channel 4. But a drop in ratings in recent years led Channel 4's director of television Kevin Lygo to announce in 2009 that the show \\"had reached a natural end point\\". 'Positive and interesting' So why is Channel 5 investing so much time and effort in reviving the format? Bosses are hopeful the programme's reincarnation will attract new audiences to the network. Channel 5 owner Richard Desmond has reportedly had a hands-on role in Big Brother's relaunch In pictures: Big Brother house Big Brother through the years \\"This will allow us to connect to a younger audience, and very importantly, we will continue to serve the viewers who love us,\\" says Jeff Ford, Channel 5's director of programmes. \\"But we're not going to tailor it for a Channel 5 audience because we want all audiences who used to love the show.\\" Speaking at the series launch party in Elstree, where the Big Brother house has been refurbished, he promises fans that the celebrity spin-off of the new series will include only the \\"the biggest, most colourful and interesting names around\\". He says they are focusing on making the programme \\"fun, positive and interesting\\", which reflects the brand values of the channel. 'Ratings gods' Tim Hincks, chief executive of Endemol, says the regular version of the series, which begins immediately after the three-week celebrity series, is going to be \\"entertaining, funny, glamorous and occasionally sexy\\". According to reports, Channel 5 owner Richard Desmond has been closely involved in the preparation for the new show, even selecting contestants himself. The media mogul, who also owns the Daily Star, the Daily Express and OK! magazine, has high hopes for Big Brother, telling the Media Guardian he wants to generate huge ratings of at least 20 million viewers. But how can a show that ran for 10 years and was given a thorough send-off be successfully resurrected? Former Big Brother winner Brian Dowling, who is replacing presenter Davina McCall in the new version, predicts it will be a success because it is \\"missing from people's TV screens\\". The 33-year-old, who won the second series in 2001 and Ultimate Big Brother last year, adds: \\"Let's be honest, Endemol and Channel Five are not spending Â£220m for no good reason. \\"Think about it, Channel 5 is right next to Channel 4 and if people are real fans, they'll watch it regardless of what channel it's on.\\" But some fans are uncertain. Dominic Norwell, 31, from Whitstable in Kent, has watched every series since its inception. By Torin DouglasMedia correspondent, BBC News Can Channel 5 make Big Brother a national talking point again? That depends on whether it has persuaded enough high-profile names to appear on Celebrity Big Brother, the launch pad for the series on its new channel. But more importantly, it depends on coverage in magazines and tabloid newspapers not owned by Richard Desmond. He bought Channel 5 as a way of extending the \\"celebrity\\" focus of his print media empire into TV. Desmond's titles - OK! magazine, the Daily Express, the Daily Star and their Sunday versions - can be relied on to promote Big Brother. So can Channel 5's OK TV! programme, which is relocating to the Big Brother house. The Daily Star proclaims it's the Official Big Brother paper with cover stories and double-page spreads on which celebrities are tipped to be in or out. But the Sun and the Daily Mirror - which have many more readers - are more interested in ITV's X Factor, \\"counting down\\" to its first show on Saturday. \\"The closure they gave the last series on Channel 4 was too final,\\" he says. \\"To bring it back on a smaller channel is just not going to work. If there's nothing else on, people might migrate over to and flick it on, but it won't be like Channel 4's show where people would plan their Friday nights round the eviction.\\" Media analyst Toby Syfret from Enders Analysis says the success of the programme is \\"immensely important\\" to Channel 5. \\"It's the big buy they have made since last year, there's a lot of money riding on it. \\"There are figures all over the place about what it is worth and with that sort of money they are intending on making a big splash.\\" He says the format - which was broadcast in 87 countries last year - is \\"very important property\\" and could \\"hurt\\" Channel 4 in terms of sales and viewing figures. \\"If you look at the audience trends of Big Brother over the years it's gone down and it is less fashionable for the young than it was some years ago, but it still delivered a very good audience profile. \\"If it's successful it will do the [Channel 5] brand nothing but good.\\" Popular formula Mr Ford is equally confident the show will be a big hit, quoting Kevin Costner's character from the 1989 film Field Of Dreams. \\"If you build it they will come. So we've built it, so obviously because we've built it they're going to come, aren't they? \\"It's in the hands of the ratings gods and I pray to them every night and that's all I can do,\\" he laughs. The ratings formula was not proven when Australian soap Neighbours moved from BBC One to Channel 5 in 2008. The show ended on a Friday and by the following Monday had lost 300,000 viewers. Channel 5's attempt at producing reality TV in the past has not been as successful as its terrestrial counterparts. In 2004 the network launched Back to Reality, which featured stars from other reality shows. The Farm made its debut in the same year, its most memorable moment being Rebecca Loos stimulating a pig for breeding purposes. Neither show was hugely popular, which might explain why producers have decided not to tamper with the successful Big Brother formula. \\"If you were to change the format too much, it wouldn't be Big Brother anymore,\\" says Gavin Henderson, the programme's creative director. He previously worked on the third series of the show, which introduced the late Jade Goody to our screens. A few physical changes will be introduced, he says, which will include a slightly bigger garden and one bedroom instead of two in the Big Brother compound. He adds that there will also be a new approach to editing, which means viewers \\"won't necessarily have to sit and watch it every single day for three months\\". Live streaming of content all day every day has also been replaced with the emphasis now being on following updates on social network sites Twitter and Facebook. No doubt there will be blanket coverage of the show across all of Desmond's publications. But whether that will be enough remains to be seen as channel bosses nervously await the first set of viewing figures on Friday. Celebrity Big Brother begins on Channel 5 on Thursday 18 August at 2100 BST.","completion":"Big Brother, a reality TV series that began in 2000, has been resurrected by Channel 5 after a drop in ratings led to its cancellation in 2009.

Information: - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi. - Rodrigues is a autonomous outer island of the Republic of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, about east of Mauritius. It is part of the Mascarene Islands which include Mauritius and Réunion. It is of volcanic origin and is surrounded by coral reef, and just off its coast lie some tiny uninhabited islands. The island used to be the tenth District of Mauritius; it gained autonomous status on 10 December 2002, and it is governed by the Rodrigues Regional Assembly. The capital of the island is Port Mathurin. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - A protectorate, in its inception adopted by modern international law, is a dependent territory that has been granted local autonomy and some independence while still retaining the suzerainty of a greater sovereign state. In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly, depending on the real nature of their relationship. Therefore, a protectorate remains an autonomous part of a sovereign state. They are different from colonies as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of settlers from the country it has suzerainty of. However, a state which remains under the protection of another state but still retains independence is known as a protected state and is different from protectorates. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - The Mascarene Islands (or Mascarenhas Archipelago) is a group of islands in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar consisting of Mauritius, Réunion and Rodrigues. The collective title is derived from the Portuguese navigator Pedro Mascarenhas, who first visited them in the early sixteenth century. The islands share a common geologic origin in the volcanism of the Réunion hotspot beneath the Mascarene Plateau and form a distinct ecoregion with a unique flora and fauna. - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City. - Modern Standard Hindi (Devanagari: , \\"Mnak Hind\\") or simply Hindi (Devanagari: , \\"Hind\\"), is an Indian language and a standardised and Sanskritised register of the Hindustani language.

Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Sanskrit (English pronunciation:; written in Devanagari script ; : or ', originally ', \\"refined speech\\") is the primary sacred language of Hinduism and \\"Mahyna\\" Buddhism, a philosophical language in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. It was also a literary language that was in use as a \\"lingua franca\\" in ancient and medieval South Asia. It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies. - Agaléga are two Outer islands of Mauritius located in the Indian Ocean, about north of Mauritius island. The population of the islands as at July 2011 was estimated at 300. The islands have a total area of 2,600 hectares. The North island is 12.5 km long and 1.5 km wide, while the South island is 7 km long and 4.5 km wide. The North Island is home to the islands' airstrip and the capital Vingt Cinq. The islands are known for their coconuts, the production of which is their main industry, and for the Agalega day gecko. - The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories. - Colonies in antiquity were city-states founded from a mother-city (its \\"metropolis\\"), not from a territory-at-large. Bonds between a colony and its metropolis remained often close, and took specific forms. However, unlike in the period of European colonialism during the early and late modern era, ancient colonies were usually sovereign and self-governing from their inception. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - The Immigration Depot ( Hindi : Aapravasi Ghat ) is a building complex located in Port Louis on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius , the first British colony to receive indentured , or contracted , labor workforce from India . From 1849 to 1923 , half a million Indian indentured labourers passed through the Immigration Depot , to be transported to plantations throughout the British Empire . The large - scale migration of the laborers left an indelible mark on the societies of many former British colonies , with Indians constituting a substantial proportion of their national populations . In Mauritius alone , 68 percent of the current total population is of Indian ancestry . The Immigration Depot has thus become an important reference point in the history and cultural identity of Mauritius . Unchecked infrastructural development in the mid- 20th century means that only the partial remains of three stone buildings from the entire complex have survived . These are now protected as a national monument , under the Mauritian national heritage legislation . The Immigration Depot 's role in social history was recognized by UNESCO when it was declared a World Heritage Site in 2006 . The site is under the management of the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund . Conservation efforts are underway to restore the fragile buildings back to their 1860s state . - In politics and history, a colony is a territory under the immediate political control of a state, distinct from the home territory of the sovereign. For colonies in antiquity, city-states would often found their own colonies. Some colonies were historically countries, while others were territories without definite statehood from their inception. - The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean or the Austral Ocean, comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica. As such, it is regarded as the fourth-largest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean. This ocean zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters. - The phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" has been used with variations to describe certain global empires that were so extensive that there was always at least one part of their territory that was in daylight. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - A trading post or trading station was a place or establishment where the trading of goods took place; the term is generally used, in modern parlance, in reference to such establishments in historic Northern America, although the practice long predates that continent's colonization by Europeans. The preferred travel route to a trading post or between trading posts, was known as a trade route. - Mauritius, officially the Republic of Mauritius, is an island nation in the Indian Ocean about off the southeast coast of the African continent. The country includes the island of Mauritius, Rodrigues [ east], and the outer islands (Agaléga, St. Brandon and two disputed territories). The islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues (southwest) form part of the Mascarene Islands, along with nearby Réunion, a French overseas department. The area of the country is 2,040 km. The capital and largest city is Port Louis. Mauritius was a British colonial possession from 1810 to 1968, the year of its independence. The government uses English as the main language. - Port Louis (Mauritian Creole: \\"Porlwi\\") is the capital city of Mauritius, located in the Port Louis District, the western part also lies in the Black River District. Port Louis is the country's economic, cultural, political centre and most populous city. It is administered by the Municipal City Council of Port Louis. According to the 2012 census conducted by Statistics Mauritius, the population was 149,194. - History (from Greek , \\"historia\\", meaning \\"inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation\\") is the study of the past as it is described in written documents. Events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians. - Saint Brandon, also known as the Cargados Carajos shoals, is an archipelago comprising a number of sand banks, shoals and islets. It is a group of outer islands belonging to Mauritius and is administered by the Outer Island Development Corporation (OIDC). Saint Brandon is located in the Indian Ocean about 430 km to the northeast of Mauritius. The islands have a total land area of 1.3 km². The reef measures more than 50 km from north to south, and is 5 km wide, cut by three passes. The reef area is 190 km². The islands have a small transient population, mostly fishermen, 63 in number on census night (Census of 2001). The majority of the population (~40) lives on Île Raphael, with smaller settlements existing on Avocaré, Coco, and Île du Sud. A former settlement existed on Albatross Island, but was abandoned in 1988. The islands are rich in flora and fauna. They are classified as a dependency of Mauritius, which is more than 300 km to the south, and are administered from Port Louis. Cargados Carajos is part of the Mascarene Islands. - Dominions were semi-independent polities under the British Crown, constituting the British Empire, beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867. They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster granted them full legislative independence. - Réunion (; previously \\"Île Bourbon\\") is an island and region of France in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar and southwest of Mauritius. , it had a population of 844,994.

What is the answer to this question? apparatus used to determine the volumetric composition of water?","completion":"To answer this question, I will first identify the apparatus used and then explain how it works to determine the volumetric composition of water. Step 1: Identify the apparatus The apparatus commonly used to determine the volumetric composition of water is a pycnometer. Step 2: Explain the process of using a pycnometer A pycnometer is a small, calibrated, and airtight glass container with a stopper that has a small hole in it. Here's how it works: 1. First, the empty weight of the pycnometer (with the stopper) is measured and recorded. 2. The pycnometer is then filled with water up to the mark, taking care to remove any trapped air bubbles. 3. The stopper is inserted, and any excess water is wiped off the exterior. 4. The pycnometer (filled with water) is weighed again, and the weight is recorded. 5. To determine the volumetric composition of water, the difference in weight between the filled pycnometer and the empty pycnometer is calculated. This gives the mass of the water. 6. The mass of the water is then divided by the pycnometer's known volume to obtain the density of water. 7. Finally, the density of water can be compared to the standard density at the same temperature to determine if there are any impurities or variations in composition. In summary, the apparatus used to determine the volumetric composition of water is a pycnometer, and it works by measuring the mass of water in a known volume to calculate its density."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Bees find a place for the hive, such as a rock crevice or tree branch - Bees gather nectar from flowers - The bees evaporate the nectar by passing it back and forth to each other - The evaporation turns the nectar into sugary honey - The bees chew the honey until it turns into moldable wax - The bees mold the wax into hexagonal (six sided) cylinders - Thousands of these hexagonal cylinders put together form the hive - Question: suppose more stormy weather occurs happens, how will it affect Bees will extract less nectar from the flowers. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"B: less Stormy weather can have a significant impact on the ability of bees to extract nectar from flowers. Here's a detailed explanation of how stormy weather affects the bees and their honey production process: 1. Flight difficulties: Bees rely on their ability to fly from one flower to another to gather nectar. Stormy weather conditions, such as strong winds, heavy rain, and lightning, make it difficult for bees to fly and navigate their surroundings. As a result, they may spend less time foraging for nectar or may have to wait for the weather to clear before resuming their nectar-collecting activities. 2. Reduced floral availability: Stormy weather can also reduce the availability of flowers from which bees collect nectar. Heavy rains may wash away or damage flowers, while strong winds can dislodge petals or break off entire blooms. Additionally, lightning may cause fires, destroying plants and their flowers. With fewer flowers available, the bees will have a harder time finding and collecting nectar. 3. Altered nectar quality: Stormy weather can also affect the quality of nectar produced by flowers. Either excessive rainfall may dilute the nectar or lack of sunlight may hinder the production of nectar in flowers. This leads to bees collecting lower-quality or less concentrated nectar, ultimately affecting honey production. 4. Increased energy expenditure: During stormy weather, bees require more energy to maintain their body temperature, fly in difficult conditions, and locate the flowers. This increased energy expenditure could mean that bees have to consume more honey or nectar than usual, leaving less for storage in the hive. 5. Negative impact on bee health: Prolonged exposure to wet, cold, and harsh conditions can have a detrimental effect on the health of bees. Wet and cold bees may suffer from decreased immune system function, increased susceptibility to diseases, and a shortened lifespan. A sick or weak bee population will have a harder time collecting nectar and producing honey. In summary, the occurrence of more stormy weather can lead to bees extracting less nectar from flowers, ultimately affecting honey production. This is due to the challenges stormy conditions pose to both the bees' ability to fly and gather nectar effectively and the availability and quality of nectar sources in their environment. Additionally, bees may experience increased energy demands and health issues during inclement weather, making it harder for them to collect nectar and produce honey."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Using census data for more than one million people in Austria, Denmark and Australia, scientists at the Max Planck Institute in the northern German town of Rostock found the month of birth was related to life expectancy over the age of 50. Seasonal differences in what mothers ate during pregnancy, and infections occurring at different times of the year could both have an impact on the health of a new-born baby and could influence its life expectancy in older age. \\"A mother giving birth in spring spends the last phase of her pregnancy in winter, when she will eat less vitamins than in summer,\\" said Gabriele Doblhammer, one of a team of scientists who carried out the research. \\"When she stops breast-feeding and starts giving her baby normal food, it's in the hot weeks of summer when babies are prone to infections of the digestive system.\\" In Austria, adults born in autumn (October-December) lived about seven months longer than those born in spring (April-June), and in Denmark adults with birthdays in autumn outlived those born in spring by about four months. In the southern hemisphere, the picture was similar. Adults born in the Australian autumn--the European spring--lived about four months longer than those born in the Australian spring. The study focused on people born at the beginning of the 20th century, using death certificates and census data. Although nutrition at all times of the year has improved since then, the seasonal pattern persists, Doblhammer said. But on the other hand, according to a study of more 40,000 people, those born in spring and summer report themselves luckier than those born in autumn or winter. Professor Richard Wise-man who led the research explained that the temperature at the time of birth might influence the development of the brain and seasonal factors make a difference as well.

Q: What term describes a colloidal dispersion of a liquid in either a liquid or a solid? Choices: - mix - suspension - compound - emulsion A: Answer:","completion":"The term that describes a colloidal dispersion of a liquid in either a liquid or a solid is an \\"emulsion\\". In this context, an emulsion refers to the process of combining two immiscible substances (i.e., substances that don't mix with each other) by dispersing one substance within the other in the form of very small droplets or particles. This process requires the presence of an emulsifying agent, which allows the formation of a stable and homogeneous mixture. To further understand the given choices: - Mix: A mix refers to a simple combination of two or more substances without any specific interaction between them. These substances can be easily separated, and they don't necessarily create a homogeneous mixture. In other words, a mix can be a general term, but it doesn't provide the specific characteristics of an emulsion. - Suspension: A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which solid particles are dispersed in a liquid medium. These particles tend to settle over time due to gravity, and the mixture can be easily separated by mechanical means like filtration. Unlike an emulsion, a suspension doesn't involve liquids in both phases, and the mixture is not stable. - Compound: A compound is a substance that consists of two or more different elements chemically bonded together. Compounds have distinct chemical and physical properties compared to their constituent elements and cannot be separated by physical means. This term doesn't apply to the scenario of a colloidal dispersion of a liquid in either a liquid or a solid. In conclusion, the term that best describes a colloidal dispersion of a liquid in either a liquid or a solid is an \\"emulsion.\\" An emulsion represents a unique mixture type that combines two immiscible substances in a stable and homogeneous state due to the presence of an emulsifying agent."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Given the following context: After her sister Olga marries and leaves home, Katrin Koerber, the daughter of an Austrian medical professor, fights loneliness and dreams of a more exciting life outside Austria.

Millions of families could benefit from a crackdown on water bills, as David Cameron tries to seize back the cost of living agenda. Ministers will announce a package of measures to shake up the market next week, to ensure customers get a ‘good deal’. While households have no choice over their water supplier, it is expected to include more discounts or ‘social tariffs’ for pensioners and the low paid. This would also help reduce the soaring burden of bad debts – worth around £1.6billion a year – which firms currently add to the water bills of other households. Bills: David Cameron, pictured on a visit to the M4 outside Cardiff today, has ordered ministers to draw up action on water charges. Unlike energy firms, whose prices are. hiked every year by the Big Six firms, annual water bills, currently an. average of £388 per family, are set in advance by industry regulator. Ofwat. But water firms have been criticised. for using legal loopholes to avoid £1billion of corporation tax, and. paying millions of pounds in bonuses to their executives during last. year’s hosepipe ban. The move comes as Labour leader Ed. Miliband called for the water industry to be ‘scrutinised’ to ensure it. is not ripping off customers. The coalition has been stung by claims it has failed to act on easing the squeeze on family finances, with Mr Miliband taking the lead with his promise to freeze gas and electricity bills for two years if he wins the next election. But today Number 10 insisted Mr Cameron ‘wants to see household costs coming down’ and targeting the water industry will be the next stage. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has already offered water customers in the South West a £50 rebate to tackle historically high bills. However, the new action to be set out by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is likely to offer help to customers across England with the details expected to be agreed this weekend. Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘Clearly the Prime Minister wants to see household costs coming down. ‘There will be some progress next week which Defra will be doing on the water industry and water bills.’ The government had already taken. action to freeze council tax bills, limit rail fare rises and cancel. increases in the cost of MoTs, he added. Water. watchdog Ofwat is preparing to block an eight per cent rise in charges. demanded by Thames Water for next year, which would add an extra £28 to. the average bill. The No.10. spokesman added: ‘The Prime Minister wants regulators there to look at. the industries they regulate and make sure that they are as robust and. delivering what they need to deliver for customers. ‘The Prime Minister realises that families are hard-pressed. He wants to see prices brought down across the board.’ Options being considered include making social tariffs for the poorest customers compulsory, capping fare rises to an amount linked to inflation and cutting the bad debt caused by customers who refuse to pay which adds £15-a-year to every bill. Costs: The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is to rush out action to limit water bill rises in an attempt to take back control of political debate over the cost of living. Details of the action on water bills are expected to be announced in the middle of next week, with Downing Street denying it had been caught on the hop by Mr Miliband. Chancellor George Osborne signalled the government's plans in a speech last month when he said: 'There are important improvements we can make to the scale of energy and water bills, the cost of housing, the fees paid for everyday financial services, the expense of rail and road travel. 'These are a burden on families – and we are doing everything we can do to reduce their cost – with more to come this autumn.' But Mr Miliband appeared to steal a march on the government yesterday with his warning that the industry could not escape scrutiny at a time when families are struggling to make ends meet. Warning: The government actions comes after Labour leader Ed Miliband said the water industry should be next to face more scrutiny. ‘I think we should be looking at all markets to make sure they are working properly and that includes the water industry,’ he told the Western Morning News yesterday. ‘Some people will say this is an anti-business agenda. I think it is a pro-business agenda that you have got to reform markets that are not working properly. ‘I think the water industry is something that should be scrutinised to make sure it is working properly and make sure it is working properly for the benefit of consumers, because I know concerns have been raised. ‘I'm proud Labour is championing this agenda and I think it is consistent with believing what a market economy can do, and water is part of that.’ A Defra Spokesperson said: 'The Government is working across the board to reduce the cost of living and help hardworking households who are feeling the pinch. 'We want to ensure customers get a good deal from the water sector and will be setting out our approach next week.' Maria Eagle, Labour's shadow environment secretary said: 'David Cameron has never shown any interest in rising water bills and has wasted three years doing absolutely nothing to address the impact on already over-burdened family budgets. 'More than two million households, over one in ten, now spend more than five per cent of their income on water according to the regulator and customers in Britain face some of the highest bills in Europe. 'Yet David Cameron still refuses to require water companies to introduce a social tariff to help those who are struggling, even though only three companies have introduced such a scheme under the current voluntary arrangement. 'That’s why Labour will use the forthcoming Water Bill legislation to require all water companies to participate in a national affordability scheme and review whether there is a need for a tougher regulatory regime.' It comes after figures this week showed the squeeze on family budgets has lasted for four years and shows no sign of coming to an end, grim new figures revealed today. Disposable incomes have remained almost unchanged since the end of the recession, with the return to economic growth having little impact on ordinary people’s spending power. Instead bills for life’s essentials like housing, energy and petrol have dramatically eaten into incomes, and now account for more than 27 per cent of all spending. The Office for National Statistics warned the economic position of households ‘remains under pressure’. Disposable incomes grew even when Britain was plunged into recession in mid-2008, but have remained ‘broadly flat’ since the summer of 2009, despite the economy growing by 4.2 per cent since then. In particular big rises in energy bills have had a devastating impact on families. Highlights:","completion":"1.

This phrase suggests that although there might be some achievement or success attained, it may not necessarily be without its darker aspects or cause for concern. The overall impact of this sentiment brings a sense of complexity and depth, making it more intriguing for readers or audience members to interpret. Breaking down the sentiment further: 1. \\"A quiet\\": The use of the word \\"quiet\\" might imply a discreet or low-profile victory or accomplishment. It suggests that the success in question was not ostentatious or vociferous, but rather achieved with a level of humility or finesse. This could be construed as a positive aspect, as it might reflect resilience, determination or hard work that is not conditioned or motivated by public adulation. 2. \\"Disquieting\\": The term \\"disquieting,\\" on the other hand, implies an element of unease, anxiety, or discomfort associated with this triumph. It suggests that the accomplishment or its consequences might evoke feelings of apprehension or suspicion in some individuals. This word infuses the sentiment with a shade of negativity, as it alludes to potential undesirable outcomes or risks related to the success. When both words are combined to form the phrase \\"a quiet, disquieting triumph,\\" the sentiment takes on a somewhat paradoxical nature. It represents a subtle, yet uneasy sense of achievement where the potential drawbacks or concerns cannot be ignored or discounted. In a broader context, this sentiment could apply to various scenarios, such as a person conquering a personal challenge while simultaneously struggling with lingering self-doubt or moral dilemmas. Alternatively, it might refer to the outcome of a political situation, where a leader's victory could be seen as positive but the means to achieving it have created unease among the public. Overall, the sentiment of \\"a quiet, disquieting triumph\\" can be perceived as an intriguing blend of understated positivity and unsettling disturbance that reflects the complexities and dualities inherent in human experiences, achievements, and emotions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Q: What weather events move with the prevailing winds and originate in the trade winds in the northern hemisphere? Choices: - tsunamis - earthquakes - droughts - hurricanes A: The answer is:","completion":"- hurricanes Hurricanes are weather events that move with the prevailing winds and originate in the trade winds in the northern hemisphere. They form in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Earth, where the warm ocean waters provide the moisture and heat needed for their development. These storms are also known as tropical cyclones or typhoons, depending on the region where they occur. The term \\"hurricane\\" is used for these storms in the Atlantic Ocean and the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The trade winds are steady easterly winds that blow mainly in the tropics, specifically between 30 degrees north and 30 degrees south latitude. In the northern hemisphere, the trade winds blow from the northeast to the southwest, while in the southern hemisphere, they blow from the southeast to the northwest. The Coriolis effect, caused by the rotation of the Earth, helps to steer the trade winds in their respective directions. Hurricanes form when warm, moist air over the ocean rises and creates an area of low pressure at the surface. This causes the surrounding air to rush into the center, creating a spiraling motion as the air is forced upward. The warm air cools as it rises, causing the moisture in the air to condense into clouds and release heat energy. This heat energy warms the surrounding air, causing it to rise further and creating a cycle of rising warm air and cooling, condensing air. As this cycle continues, the storm system strengthens and starts to organize into a more defined structure. The trade winds play a significant role in the formation and movement of hurricanes in the northern hemisphere. These easterly winds steer the developing storms from the east to the west, generally towards the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm system moves along the path of the trade winds, it encounters areas of warmer ocean waters, which help to fuel its growth and intensify its strength. When conditions are favorable, such as low vertical wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, these disturbances can rapidly develop into massive and powerful storms. As hurricanes grow in strength, they move with the prevailing winds, which is largely influenced by the trade winds and other global wind patterns, such as the jet stream. These steering winds help to determine the path a hurricane will take, as well as its movement speed. As the hurricane moves across the ocean, it can cause widespread destruction through its heavy rainfall, strong winds, and storm surges. The other choices - tsunamis, earthquakes, and droughts - do not fit the criteria of weather events that move with prevailing winds and are associated with the trade winds in the northern hemisphere. Tsunamis are caused by the displacement of water due to underwater earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, while earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates and have no direct connection to weather processes. Droughts, on the other hand, refer to prolonged periods of abnormally low rainfall, which can indirectly be influenced by global wind patterns. However, they are not considered discrete weather events that originate and move with the trade winds specifically."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I don't journey over to Willy St. as much as I would like, but when I do find myself on that side of Madison the Weary is always my first choice for dinner and drinks with friends. Back in college I first heard of this place from a coworker who lived in the area. He told me in no uncertain terms that I needed to come out after work for a few drinks and a late dinner, and I'm happy that I took him up on the offer. Since then I've made my way back on a semi-regular basis. The best times at the Weary are when you come in and find a nice larger table right away, especially if you can get one of the corner tables. The place is almost always crowded, a victim of its own success in a way, and there are no reservations or waiting lists, just first-come first-serve. As mentioned, there really isn't a good place to wait, and if you end up here crammed in the corner of the bar hoping for a table to open it can be a frustrating experience. I don't think I've gone on a Friday or Saturday night in some time because of this, instead opting for weekday nights or later in the afternoons. It's a testament to how good this place is that I find myself working my schedule around their busy times. The Weary hits all of the right notes: the food is exceptional, the tap selection is top-notch, and the vibe hits the right tone of hip and mellow. I've made my way through at least half of the relatively short menu, though I've been here more than enough times to try everything at least once over. I've been prevented from doing so by the extreme excellence of the West of the Andes sandwich - possibly my favorite in all of Madison. I usually get the tenderloin option (also comes with tuna or veggies), served with avocado, pico de gallo and chipotle mayo. It's simply the best. Also great: the Weary's Reuben - probably the best I've ever had, and the Bad Breath burger, which is as great as everyone says. The goulash is what I tend to go with when I'm looking for a smaller meal, and even then it's filling. There's a vegan chili as well, which I usually go Not-So and get with beef tips and bacon. And if you're there with a good sized group of friends you can't go wrong with either the WI cheese & sausage platter or the Mediterranean plate. I love the Weary Traveler and I've spent many a great night over the last five plus years with friends and family - in fact the Weary is my father's favorite Madison restaurant on account of the goulash.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -11*z - 6*z - 85 = 0 for z.","completion":"Okay, kiddo. Let's make this really simple! So, we have -11*z and -6*z. These are like two baskets of apples having -11 and -6 apples respectively. If we put all apples together, we end up having -17 apples in total or in math language, -17*z. The equation now looks like: \\"-17*z - 85 = 0\\" To make it easy, let's say we owe our friend 17 candies for every 'z' and we just borrowed 85 more candies. In total, we owe them 17*z and 85 candies. Now, we want to find how many candies 'z' stands for, if all the candies we owe in total brings us to zero. To figure this out, we need to move the 85 candies to the other side of the \\"=\\". This makes the 85 change from negative to positive, because if we're giving back candies, we're bringing the amount we owe closer to zero. So, now our equation would look like \\"-17*z = 85\\" Here, z will be equal to 85 divided by -17, since dividing is like separating all the candies equally among our 'z' friends. Finally, when we divide 85 by -17, we get -5. So, in our case 'z' is equal to -5. That means, we owe each friend 5 candies to get to zero. I hope that makes sense!

The boy tried lots of different medicines to cure his pimples but the","completion":"pimples never seemed to go away. He was always in search for a miracle treatment that would give him clear, smooth skin. The journey to find a cure for his acne-prone skin began when he was just a teenager, and his frustration grew with each passing year. Daily, he would wake up and scrutinize his face in the mirror, looking for any signs of improvement. Despite his efforts, the pimples persisted, sometimes even worsening. He felt embarrassed and self-conscious about his appearance, and it took a toll on his self-esteem. He started avoiding social gatherings and withdrew from activities that he once enjoyed. His friendships began to suffer as he began to isolate himself, unable to bear the burden of constantly feeling judged because of his skin. During his quest, the boy tried several over-the-counter creams, gels, and lotions that claimed to target pimples and clear up acne. He spent hundreds of dollars on different products, hoping to find the one that finally worked. Many times, he believed he had found the ideal solution, only to be disappointed a few weeks later when the pimples returned – sometimes worse than before. In pursuit of his goal, the boy ventured deeper into the realm of skincare. He researched natural remedies and homemade concoctions, hunting for a more permanent and less expensive answer. He experimented with ingredients like honey, lemon, and tea tree oil, and even changed his diet in an attempt to pinpoint any food triggers. He learned about the importance of maintaining a clean face, avoiding excessive sun exposure, and staying hydrated. As he continued his journey, the boy turned to healthcare professionals for advice and guidance. He consulted dermatologists and estheticians, discussing with them his extensive history of failed treatments. They prescribed an array of treatments, from topical medications, like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, to oral prescriptions, such as antibiotics and even isotretinoin. Some of these medications seemed to help initially, but they often came with unpleasant side effects, including dry skin and irritation. His search for a solution continued. By the time the boy had reached young adulthood, he felt as though he had tried everything. He was beginning to lose hope that he would ever find a cure for his pimples. Some nights, he would sit alone in his bedroom, filled with despair and wondering if he was destined to live his life hidden away from the world. One day, while browsing the internet, he stumbled upon a blog that detailed a young woman’s similar struggle with acne. She described how, after years of trial and error, she had discovered a holistic approach to skincare that had transformed her skin completely. Intrigued, the boy delved deeper, consumed by this newfound knowledge he had been missing out on. He learned about the importance of looking at his skin as a reflection of his overall health. The blog emphasized the connection between stress, hormones, gut health, and inflammation in relation to acne. Realizing he had never considered these factors in his quest for clear skin, the boy began to develop a better understanding of his own body. Armed with this new insight, the boy embarked on a journey of self-discovery. He started to make changes to his lifestyle, focusing on reducing stress, improving his diet, and exercising regularly. He began to meditate and practice mindfulness, connecting with his emotions and learning how to manage his anxiety and tension. Slowly but surely, the boy noticed a change. His pimples began to heal and his skin's texture improved. He gained a newfound confidence and started to reconnect with the world that he'd shut out for so long. The journey to finding a cure for his pimples had been long and challenging, but through it all, the boy gained valuable knowledge about his body, his health, and what true confidence meant – and in the end, his journey proved to be worthwhile, both on the outside and within."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An HDMI cable connects the receiver to the TV, and it stays put. You don't have to string cables every time you want to have a video call on the TV. And the wireless connection supports the high-definition 1080p format, so the picture is always clean and clear. The lens in the ConnectHD camera has a wide-angle view. That means everyone on your end of the conversation can get in the picture without bumping heads. I set up the ConnectHD system in our kitchen using our 26-inch LCD TV and a Windows netbook computer. I installed Warpia's software and had everything working in about 15 minutes. The camera's view took in the kitchen's center island and most of the rest of the room, and its built-in microphone picked up everyone's voices. Nobody had to crowd around the TV or shout to be heard. Incoming audio also sounded much better coming from the TV than when we did Skype calls on the computer with its tiny (and tinny) speakers.

Martha and the Vandellas (known from 1967 to 1972 as Martha Reeves and the Vandellas) were an American all-female vocal group formed in 1957. The group achieved fame in the 1960s with Motown. Selected Members of the group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. Formed in 1957 by friends Annette Beard, Rosalind Ashford and Gloria Williams, the group eventually included Martha Reeves, who moved up in ranks as lead vocalist of the group after Williams' departure in 1962. Teenagers Rosalind Ashford and Annette Beard first became acquainted after a local music manager hired them to be members of a girl group he named The Del-Phis. Ashford & Beard, along with then-lead vocalist Gloria Williams, performed at local clubs, private events, church benefits, YMCA events and school functions. They were also being coached by Maxine Powell at Detroit's Ferris Center. One of the group's first professional engagements was singing background for singer Mike Hanks. The group originally had up to six members, shortened to four. After another member left the group, she was replaced by Alabama-born vocalist Martha Reeves, who had been a member of a rival group, the Fascinations and had also been a member of another group, the Sabre-Ettes. In 1960, the group signed their first recording contract with Checker Records, releasing the Reeves-led \\"I'll Let You Know\\". The record flopped. The group then recorded for Checkmate Records, a subsidiary of Chess Records, recording their first take of \\"There He Is (At My Door)\\". That record, featuring Williams on lead vocals, also flopped. Briefly separated, Reeves returned to a solo career performing under the name Martha LaVaille, in hopes of getting a contract with emerging Detroit label Motown. After Motown staffer Mickey Stevenson noticed Reeves singing at a prominent Detroit club, he offered her his business card for an audition. Reeves showed up at Motown on a wrong date (Motown auditions were held at Thursdays, while Reeves showed up to Motown's Hitsville USA studios on a Tuesday). Stevenson, initially upset, told Reeves to look out for clients and other matters. Soon Reeves became Stevenson's secretary and later was responsible for helping acts audition for the label. By 1961, the group, now known as The Vels, were recording background vocals for Motown acts. Prior to her success as lead singer of The Elgins, Sandra Edwards (then going by her surname Maulett) recorded the song \\"Camel Walk\\", in 1962, which featured the Vels in background vocals. That year, the quartet began applying background vocals for emerging Motown star Marvin Gaye, singing on Gaye's first hit single, \\"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\\" After Mary Wells failed to make a scheduled recording session feigning a short illness, the Vels recorded what was initially a demo recording of \\"I'll Have to Let Him Go\\". Motown was so impressed by the group's vocals - and Martha's lead vocals in the song - that the label CEO Berry Gordy offered to give the group a contract. Figuring that being in show business was too rigorous, Williams opted out of the group. With Williams out, the remaining trio of Ashford, Beard and Reeves renamed themselves The Vandellas, after Detroit's Van Dyke Street and Reeves' favorite singer, Della Reese.","completion":"This text is about Martha and the Vandellas, an American all-female vocal group formed in 1957.

Write an article with the title: \\"No scrubs, please.\\"","completion":"Title: No Scrubs, Please Introduction: Many of us have heard the term \\"scrub\\" before, referring to an individual who may seem lazy, unambitious, or downright disrespectful. In this article, we will explore what it means to be a scrub, why it is important to avoid such behaviors, and how to cultivate better habits for personal and professional success. Let's dive into the world of no scrubs, please! Step 1: Define a scrub A scrub is a term that is often used to describe a person who lacks motivation, confidence, or respect for others. They may have poor social skills and demonstrate behaviors that are detrimental to their well-being or the well-being of those around them. It is important to recognize these traits in ourselves and others to ensure that we are promoting a positive and progressive environment. Step 2: Identify the reasons behind scrub behavior In order to combat scrub behaviors, it is important to first understand the reasons behind them. Scrubs may develop their habits due to various factors, including upbringing, social influences, or personal insecurities. Once we identify the root causes of these behaviors, it becomes easier to cultivate better habits and foster personal growth. Step 3: Highlight the consequences of scrub behavior Scrubs can inflict harm not only on themselves but also on the people around them. By displaying laziness, negativity, and disrespect, they may prevent themselves from reaching their full potential and hinder the growth of their peers. Additionally, scrub behaviors can lead to negative consequences in work and social settings, such as being passed up for job opportunities or facing social isolation. Step 4: Encourage self-reflection One of the most effective ways to address scrub behavior is through self-reflection. This means honestly evaluating one's own actions, attitudes, and beliefs to identify and rectify any areas where poor habits may be present. It's important to take personal responsibility for our behaviors and strive for continuous self-improvement. Step 5: Promote positive and respectful habits In order to move away from scrub behavior, it is essential to develop positive habits that foster personal and professional success. This includes practicing active listening, showing respect for others' opinions and beliefs, and fostering a growth mindset. These habits will not only benefit the individual but also contribute to a more positive and supportive environment. Step 6: Always maintain accountability Finally, it is important to always maintain accountability for one's actions and acknowledge when scrub-like behaviors may have resurfaced. This process of self-awareness and responsibility will ensure that individuals continue to grow and progress in their personal journeys toward better habits and attitudes. Conclusion: In conclusion, by understanding the nature of scrubs and the reasons behind their behaviors, we can actively work to avoid them and promote a more positive environment. Through self-reflection, accountability, and cultivating positive habits, we can all move away from the scrub mentality and contribute to a world in which respect and growth are prioritized.

Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get \\"caught in the act\\" of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him. In 1918 he wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the Kadet party, murdered by Bolshevik sailors.In 1919, at the age of 13, he was admitted to the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who monitored Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What village's first Boy Scout troop was Troop 1 Briarcliff, founded before 1919? ? The village symbol is the Briarcliff Rose, a more brightly colored offshoot of the American Beauty rose. Since 2006, the Briarcliff Rose has been used on village street signs. The Briarcliff Manor Garden Club, which also uses the Briarcliff rose as their symbol, was established in 1956. One of its primary functions is in planting, maintaining, and improving public gardens and grounds.Briarcliff Manor has groups in several Scouting organizations, including Cub Scout Pack 6 and Boy Scout Troop 18. Pack 6 became the first Cub Scout pack in the village at its establishment in 1968; by 2002 it had over 70 cubs in 12 dens. The village's first Boy Scout troop was Troop 1 Briarcliff, founded before 1919. Sources cite Bill Buffman as the first Scoutmaster and John Hersey as the troop's first Eagle Scout. The first Girl Scout troop in the village was founded in 1917 by Louise Miller and Mrs. Alfred Jones, and the first Brownie troop was founded in 1929.The Briarcliff Manor Community Bonfire is a winter holiday event at Law Park, hosted by the village and the Briarcliff Friends of the Arts, involving live music (primarily seasonal and holiday songs), refreshments, and craft projects for children. Another annual community event is the Memorial Day parade, a tradition in Briarcliff Manor for more than fifty years. Before the parade begins, the Municipal Building's bell is rung to commemorate firefighters who have died in the previous year; the parade ends at the village's war memorial in Law Park, where wreaths are laid on the monument. The holiday has been celebrated in the village since the early 1900s, though initially involving large family picnics, with parades reserved for the Fourth of July.

Article: You’ll be able to find the proper size for your underwear across brands if you know your waist and hip measurements. Use a tape measure to measure your natural waist and the fullest part of your hips so you can choose the most comfortable size for your body. You can find your natural waist by bending sideways. A crease will form at your waist to help you identify it. Keep the tape measure parallel to the ground when you measure your hips. It’s a good idea to measure both your waist and hips twice to make sure that you get the same measurement both times. Once you have your waist and hip measurements, you can consult the sizing information for any underwear you’re considering to ensure a proper fit. Checking your measurement is important, because sometimes you don't get it right the first time. If your measurements are different on the second try, measure them a third time. One of these sets should match up, so use that set of measurements when shopping. No one wants to be pulling at their underwear all day to keep it from slipping or falling down. Choose underwear that has firm elastic in the waistband so you know it will stay in place. While firm elastic at the waist is helpful in underwear, avoid styles with elasticized leg holes. They have a tendency to bunch up, which can be uncomfortable. Underwear that’s too tight doesn’t just lead to unflattering bulges and lumps beneath your clothing; it can also cause skin chafing and irritation from the friction. In general, any underwear that’s tight enough to leave marks on your skin is too tight. Underwear that’s too tight also doesn’t breathe as well, so it can lead to health issues and leave you a little sweaty. Before leaving the house for the day, it’s important to make sure that your undies are lying smoothly against your body. Any pair that bunches, rolls, or sags under your clothing is going to be uncomfortable because you’ll be tugging at them to keep them from pinching your skin or falling down. Not only can bunching underwear be uncomfortable in the long run, but it can also look messy and ruin even the best outfit. This is especially important with dresses and skirts! If your underwear is bunching, readjust it so that it sits properly on you. If it still bunches, switch to a different pair. Bunching, rolling, and sagging is often a sign of old, worn underwear; it means that the fabric has lost its stretch and is now too big for you. What is a summary?","completion":"Summary: To find the proper size for your underwear across different brands, measure your natural waist and hips using a tape measure.

Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century. Longacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm. He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844. In Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre. Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained. Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict. In 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece. In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what keeps mammals warm?\\" is \\"animal fur\\", given that mammals have a layer of fat under the skin to keep them warm? Answer:","completion":"I would say the right answer to the question \\"what keeps mammals warm?\\" is a combination of both \\"animal fur\\" and a \\"layer of fat under the skin.\\" While it is true that many mammals have a layer of fat under their skin to help insulate and retain body heat, fur also plays a crucial role in maintaining their body temperature. Animal fur consists of two main layers: the undercoat and the guard hairs. The undercoat is the dense, insulating layer that traps air close to the body, creating a warm barrier to help prevent heat loss. The guard hairs are the longer, waterproof, and often oil-covered hairs that protect the undercoat and help repel moisture. Together, these two layers create an effective insulation system that helps maintain the mammal's body temperature in cold environments. Furthermore, the layer of fat under the skin acts as an additional layer of insulation, not only conserving body heat but also providing an energy source during periods of food scarcity. This layer is particularly beneficial for marine mammals, such as whales and seals, living in cold aquatic environments where losing heat quickly can be a significant threat to survival. In conclusion, both animal fur and a layer of fat under the skin contribute to keeping mammals warm, with each playing a crucial role in maintaining the mammal's body temperature and overall survival in cold environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Let's say you're working with the following problem: Y =√(x-7) You cannot take the square root of a negative number, though you can take the square root of 0. So, set the terms inside the radicand to be greater than or equal to 0. Note that this applies not just to square roots, but to all even-numbered roots. It does not, however, apply to odd-numbered roots, because it is perfectly fine to have negatives under odd roots. Here's how: x-7 ≧ 0 Now, to isolate x on the left side of the equation, just add 7 to both sides, so you're left with the following: x ≧ 7 Here is how you would write it: D = [7,∞) Let's say you're working with the following function: Y = 1/√( ̅x2 -4). When you factor the denominator and set it equal to zero, you'll get x ≠ (2, - 2). Here's where you go from there: Now, check the area below -2 (by plugging in -3, for example), to see if the numbers below -2 can be plugged into the denominator to yield a number higher than 0. They do. (-3)2 - 4 = 5 Now, check the area between -2 and 2. Pick 0, for example. 02 - 4 = -4, so you know the numbers between -2 and 2 don't work. Now try a number above 2, such as +3. 32 - 4 = 5, so the numbers over 2 do work. Write the domain when you're done. Here is how you would write the domain: D = (-∞, -2) U (2, ∞) Summary:","completion":"The article discusses finding the domain of functions with roots or radicals. For even-numbered roots, the terms inside the radicand must be greater than or equal to 0, while odd-numbered roots can have negatives. Two examples are given.

Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view.

By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\"\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The views that Scout contends with in Harper Lee's novel, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" revolve around societal expectations and prejudices, particularly in regards to gender roles, racism, and classism. As Scout grows up and tries to understand the world around her, she encounters various female characters who help shape her development and attitudes towards these issues. Scout primarily identifies with her father, Atticus Finch, and older brother, Jem. This allows her to observe female characters from both an outsider's perspective and as a female herself. She is influenced by strong, independent, and protective women like Calpurnia and Miss Maudie. These characters serve as positive role models for Scout, demonstrating strength and resilience in the face of societal expectations and prejudices. On the other hand, Scout also encounters female characters who represent and uphold more traditional beliefs, such as racist and classist attitudes. For instance, Mayella Ewell's false testimony against Tom Robinson, an innocent black man, exemplifies the destructive power of racial prejudice. Scout also faces criticism about not adhering to traditional gender roles from Mrs. Dubose, who chastises her for not wearing a dress and camisole, and accuses her of ruining the family name by not doing so. Mrs. Dubose also questions and insults Atticus' decision to defend Tom Robinson. By experiencing these various perspectives and influences, Scout begins to develop a sense of independence and ultimately embodies feminist ideals. She learns to question and challenge the societal norms related to gender, race, and class, adopting a more progressive and open-minded worldview. Through the character of Scout, Harper Lee gradually showcases her journey towards becoming a feminist in the South, as she maintains her ambivalence about being a Southern lady and navigates the complexities of societal expectations and prejudices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A scientist studied the effects of alcoholic beverages on the human body during severe weather exposure. He decided to experiment on himself. He stood in -30 degrees weather for 2 hours and called it experiment A. He then repeated the experiment, the only difference being that he consumed a pint of hard liquor before and during those two hours, and that was called experiment B. When did the person have a lower core temperature, during experiment A, or during B? Answer:","completion":"To determine when the person had a lower core temperature, during experiment A or B, we need to consider the effects of alcohol on the human body and the specific conditions of each experiment. Step 1: Understand the conditions of the experiments - Experiment A: the scientist is exposed to -30 degrees weather for 2 hours without consuming alcohol. - Experiment B: the scientist is exposed to the same conditions (-30 degrees for 2 hours) but consumes a pint of hard liquor before and during the experiment. Step 2: Analyze the effects of alcohol on the human body - Alcohol causes blood vessels to dilate, which increases blood flow to the skin's surface. This can create a feeling of warmth. - The increased blood flow to the skin's surface combined with the cold weather could lead to a faster loss of body heat in experiment B. Step 3: Compare the two experiments - In experiment A, the scientist is exposed to cold temperatures but does not consume alcohol. Therefore, there is no alcohol-induced dilation of the blood vessels, and the body loses heat at a more controlled rate. - In experiment B, the scientist consumes alcohol, which may cause the body to lose heat faster due to increased blood flow to the skin's surface and the cold weather conditions. Conclusion: The person likely had a lower core temperature during experiment B, as the consumption of alcohol could have caused a faster loss of body heat due to the dilation of blood vessels and increased blood flow to the skin's surface."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There was one very well-off bunny in the village who had a large burrow and lots of food saved up. He wasn't worried about the drought at all. The other bunnies, though, looked at the purple-red nettles withering in the fields and the mayweed that hadn't even flowered and wondered if they were going to have enough food to get them through the next winter. The very well-off bunny was named Albertus, but everybody called him Big Al--at least they called him that when they were sure he couldn't hear them. Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there. The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village. One morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought. There was still a bit of a cool breeze from Possum Creek, a mile or so away. Sophie Bunny, who was large and sleek, with a black circle around one eye, was there with her husband Lenny and their youngest, Ralph, who still lived at home with them. \\"I don't mind telling you,\\" Lenny said, \\"I'm getting a little scared by all this.\\" Lenny was a small, tan bunny with buck teeth and big cheeks like a chipmunk. \\"No need to be afraid,\\" said the short, overweight Reverend Billy Bunny, the village's spiritual leader. \\"The Easter Bunny will provide.\\" He sat, as he usually did, by the thick green hawthorn bush in the middle of the square--although the bush was neither as thick nor as green as it had once been. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is most likely true about Reverend Billy Bunny? Options: A.

Jake has become one of the most famous schoolchildren in South Africa since people began sharing a picture of him, joking he was everything from a grumpy driving instructor to an unimpressed security guard. But Jake lives thousands of miles north, in a small village in eastern Ghana, unaware of his new-found fame. In fact, up until Wednesday, not even the man who took the photograph knew it had proved such a hit. Pensive Cameraman Carlos Cortes travelled to Ghana in 2015 to make a documentary about Solomon Adufah, an artist returning to his home country from the US. The picture of Jake, then four, was one of hundreds taken by Cortes while Adufah taught art and creative studies to the children. \\"I just caught Jake in the moment of his teaching,\\" Cortes, of Chicago, told the BBC. \\"He definitely has a pensive look on his face.\\" The two men then returned to the States, unaware they had captured a future star. Image copyright Carlos Cortes Image caption The then four-year-old is described as shy, quiet and talented Image copyright Twitter Image caption Memes like this one have become popular in South Africa But the schoolboy's picture began doing the rounds after Adufah shared it on his Instagram account. When he first realised it had gone viral, he was unsure of how to react to the posts, worried they were making fun of Jake. \\"I thought, I'm not going to respond,\\" the 27-year-old told the BBC. \\"But then I remember a moment when I thought, what if all these 'likes' turned into actual funds to help?\\" Jake and his friends live in a rural village, and for some families sending their children to school is more than they can afford. What is more, the primary school is also in need of supplies. \\"I remember one day we spent 20 minutes just trying to make sure we had enough pencils for all the kids,\\" Mr Cortes said. \\"That's what the campaign is really about.\\" Image copyright Carlos Cortes Image caption Solomon Adufah poses with the children, with Jake sitting in the front row So Adufah, who has lived in the US since he was 16, set up a fundraising campaign, hoping Jake will really inspire people to turn their likes into cash to help pay for his education, and that of the other children in the village. Within 24 hours, it had raised 2,000 (£1,642) - 10% of its target. Adufah said: \\"This money could make a huge difference to the kids - this could be something really positive going forward.\\" ||||| Jake Amo has become a media darling after picture memes of the Ghanaian boy went viral.

Homeland Ghana is an initiative by Solomon Adufah who facilitated an art class in the village of Asempanaye, Koforidua where the image was taken in 2015. Since receiving a flood of inquiries about the photograph, Adufah has gone on to social media to express his thoughts on the picture memes. In the post, he speaks fondly of Jake and says: \\"The Internet has a way of visually misrepresenting positive images and people often troll, shedding negative light on priceless unique moments... Everyone say hi to my buddy Jake. This was moments in Ghana during my art workshop with the kids. Each kid received brand new set of crayons, pencil colors, pencils, toys and other wonderful goodies.

Question: Given the background: Plants can grow as much as 50 percent faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm CO2 when compared with ambient conditions, though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients. Elevated CO2 levels cause increased growth reflected in the harvestable yield of crops, with wheat, rice and soybean all showing increases in yield of 12–14% under elevated CO2 in FACE experiments.Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations result in fewer stomata developing on plants which leads to reduced water usage and increased water-use efficiency. Studies using FACE have shown that CO2 enrichment leads to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants. This may have knock-on effects on other parts of ecosystems as herbivores will need to eat more food to gain the same amount of protein.The concentration of secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids and the situation: Jerry and Gary each live in separate cities, but both run equally sized farms that grow the same produce. The cities they live in have very similar environments with the only difference being that the CO2 levels in Jerry's town are elevated, and in Gary's they are not.

The given background information states that studies using Free-Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) have shown that elevated CO2 levels, as found in Jerry's town, lead to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants.

Unusual susceptibility to PUD in RA, independent of therapy, has been suggested.

The relationship of PUD to sex distribution, smoking, alcohol consumption and anti-inflammatory therapy followed expected patterns. We found high but similar PUD rates in RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients (RA 15%, OA 18%). This suggests that a common factor (probably drugs) is responsible.

The original version can be found here. By Nolan Feeney @NolanFeeney and Andrew Katz @katz Days of angry but peaceful protests in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray devolved after his funeral Monday into scenes of rioting, arson and looting that carried into Tuesday, leaving more than a dozen police officers injured and prompting the declarationof a state of emergency as reinforcements arrived to restore order. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said late Monday he activated the National Guard as a “last resort” to tamp down the violence as night fell. “People have the right to protest and express their frustration,” he told reporters, “but Baltimore City families deserve peace and safety in their communities and these acts of violence and destruction of property cannot and will not be tolerated.” State police said an additional 5,000 officers from around the Mid-Atlantic region were requested to assist with the chaos that had erupted in West Baltimore. Hogan’s statement followed a news conference by Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who said a city-wide curfew would go into effect Tuesday, from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m, and last for one week. A separate curfew for juveniles is already in place. “We are deploying every resource possible to gain control of the situation and to ensure peace moving forward,” she said. “It is idiotic to think that by destroying your city that you’re going to make life better for anybody.” Read more: The Wire Creator Calls for End to Violence in Baltimore At least 27 people were arrested by Monday evening and 15 officers were injured, with two still hospitalized, police said. One officer was unresponsive and others had broken bones. Monday’s riots came hours after funeral services were held for Gray. His death on April 19, following a fatal injury sustained in police custody during his arrest one week earlier, has become the latest to ignite the national debate on race and police brutality. Baltimore police denied using force against the 25-year-old; one of the family’s attorneys said Gray’s spine was 80% “severed at the neck.” A video recorded by a bystander shows Gray, who appears to have trouble walking, being placed inside a police van. Officials are investigating exactly how Gray received those injuries. The Justice Department and the FBI are conducting civil rights investigations into Gray’s death. Gray’s family had requested protesters not march on the day they paid their respects to him. According to the Baltimore Sun, city law enforcement officials became concerned about references on social media of a “purge”—apparently named after the plot of the movie The Purge, about a night when all crime is legal—that would begin at Mondawmin Mall at 3 p.m. and continue toward the downtown area. The University of Maryland Baltimore announced it would close early due to a police warning about the planned events, and several other businesses reportedly did the same. A group of 75 to 100 youths making their way toward the mall were met by officers in riot gear, the Sun reports, and the confrontations escalated from there. Projectiles like bottles, bricks, rocks and stickers were aimed at lines of officers, who had protective gear, shields and tear gas at their disposal. Live footage from a news helicopter showed the scene intensify, with people standing atop a police cruiser and smashing in its roof and windows. Elsewhere in the area, others were seen flooding into local businesses, like a check-cashing store and a liquor store, then returning outside with their hauls. One CVS drug store that was looted was later set on fire, and television cameras captured people slashing the fire hoses to prevent firefighters from putting out the flames. In a live televised interview as footage showed smoke billowing from the store, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings said “We never expected anything like this.” The escalation prompted the Baltimore Orioles to announce on Twitter that Monday evening’s home game against the Chicago White Sox had been postponed after consultations with city authorities; it will be rescheduled for a later date. Former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley, who is a former Baltimore mayor and a presumed Democratic presidential candidate, said he would forego several paid speeches in Europe and return to Baltimore. “I’m saddened that the City I love is in such pain this night. All of us share a profound feeling of grief for Freddie Gray & his family,” he wrote on Twitter. “We must come together as one City to transform this moment of loss & pain into a safer & more just future for all of Baltimore’s people.” The White House said Attorney General Loretta Lynch updated President Barack Obama after her swearing-in ceremony. Lynch issued a statement later in the evening, condemning what she called “senseless acts of violence by some individuals,” and said the Justice Department was ready to provide assistance to the city as needed. “Those who commit violent actions, ostensibly in protest of the death of Freddie Gray, do a disservice to his family, to his loved ones, and to legitimate peaceful protestors who are working to improve their community for all its residents.” Read more: Baltimore Mourns Freddie Gray as Officials Call for Reforms Late Monday, a fire began to engulf a senior center that was being built by a nearby church. The pastor, Rev. Donte L. Hickman, told the New York Times that he considered the fire to be set deliberately and was “probably a result of what is taking place because of all the injustice that people feel in the community.” An attorney for Gray’s family, Mary Koch, said during an interview on CNN that the violence had “completely detracted” from his death and the family’s quest for answers. In a brief statement to reporters at around 11 p.m., local time, Gray’s twin sister, Fredericka, called the violence “wrong” and said “I don’t think that’s for Freddie.” Around that time, at the scene of one of the blazes around the city, Rawlings-Blake spoke again to reporters. The mayor, who was born and raised in Baltimore, called the scenes of destruction “extremely heartbreaking.” “This is one of our darkest days as a city,” she said, “and I know that we are much better than this.” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"In Baltimore, some people got really upset by the death of Freddie Gray, who was hurt while he was being arrested by the police. After some peaceful protests, there were some angry people who started to break things, start fires, and even hurt police officers. The leaders of the city and the state decided that they needed to call in extra help to stop the violence and make sure people were safe. They also told everyone they had to be inside their homes by 10 p.m. for a week. Freddie Gray's family and many others said that breaking things and hurting people wasn't a good way to express how upset they were."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who possibly acquired his later connections with the French royal chapel through early experiences at Saint-Quentin? is inside the article: Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet. All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the collegiate chapel there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was..., can you guess it ?

It's part of a growing worldwide trend toward outdoor education. The schools are called forest kindergartens. The numbers are small so far in the U.S., but the idea is well established in Europe, with schools in Scotland, England, and Switzerland. By far the most such schools are in Germany, which has more than 400 forest kindergartens. Some schools feature several hours of outdoor schooling. This is certainly the case with the Waldorf School of Saratoga Springs. Children there will be venturing out on the nearby Hemlock Trail to learn more about the natural world. Some lessons are focused on nature; others are academic topics delivered in a natural setting. In all cases, students are active-not sitting at desks or on mats on the floor but walking, running, jumping, solving problems like how to get the mud off the bottoms of their shoes before their parents find out. Seriously, the focus is on activity at these schools. Studies have shown that children's immune systems actually get stronger after all of the outdoor activity, and that graduates of forest kindergartens show a higher ability to learn when they progress through their academic careers. Other schools are all outdoors, all the time. This is the case with the Cedar Song Nature School, on Vashon Island, Washington. Students at this school spend their whole three-hour day outdoors, in a private five-acre forest, doing all kinds of physical activities. At these forest kindergartens, students learn science by observing and doing it, learn math by applying it to the natural world around them, learn letters and words by putting them together using sights and sounds. These students learn how to get along with one another, individually and in a group. They also develop healthy levels of self-confidence. Nowadays many children become obese because of sedentary activities like watching television and playing video games. These outdoor schools give children chances to learn just as much, if not more, from opening their eyes...

He popularized the classification of birds on the basis of the quinarian system. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature (from Latin \\"philosophia naturalis\\") was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science. It is considered to be the precursor of natural science. - The Quinarian system was a method of zoological classification which had a brief period of popularity in the mid 19th century, especially among British naturalists. It was largely developed by the entomologist William Sharp MacLeay in 1819. The system was further promoted in the works of Nicholas Aylward Vigors, William John Swainson and Johann Jakob Kaup. Swainson's work on ornithology gave wide publicity to the idea. The system had opponents even before the publication of Charles Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species\\" (1859 ) which paved the way for evolutionary trees. - Johann Jakob Kaup ( April 10 , 1803 - July 4 , 1873 ) was a German naturalist .

He was born at Darmstadt. After studying at Göttingen and Heidelberg he spent two years at Leiden, where his attention was specially devoted to the amphibians and fishes. He then returned to Darmstadt as an assistant in the grand ducal museum, of which in 1840 he became inspector. In 1829 he published \\"Skizze zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der europäischen Thierwelt\\", in which he regarded the animal world as developed from lower to higher forms, from the amphibians through the birds to the beasts of prey; but subsequently he repudiated this work as a youthful indiscretion, and on the publication of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" he declared himself against its doctrines. The extensive fossil deposits in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt gave him ample opportunities for palaeontological inquiries, and he gained considerable reputation by his \\"Beiträge zur näheren Kenntniss der urweltlichen Säugethiere\\" (18551862).

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). Two teams were competing in a 5 km race. White team warmed up before the race, but Blue team arrived with a bus late and didn't have time to warm up properly before the race. Which team had fewer athletes with increased blood flow to the muscles before the race?","completion":"The team with fewer athletes with increased blood flow to the muscles before the race was the Blue team. The reason behind this is that the White team did a proper warm-up before participating in the 5 km race, while the Blue team, unfortunately, arrived late on a bus and did not have time to adequately warm up before starting the race. A proper warm-up plays a crucial role in preparing the body, especially muscles and tendons, for physical activity. Warming up consists of a gradual increase in the intensity of an exercise, which ultimately causes a rise in both blood flow to the muscles and heart rate. When the muscles and tendons are effectively warmed up, they become more flexible, resulting in a reduced risk of injury. This is particularly important for high-intensity sports, like running and soccer. Warming up can also improve overall performance during the actual activity. In this scenario, the White team's athletes would have had an increased blood flow to their muscles and an elevated heart rate, resulting from their warm-up session. The increased blood flow helps oxygenate the muscle tissues and makes them more resistant to strain. On the other hand, the Blue team's athletes, who had not adequately warmed up, would have lower blood flow to their muscles, thus rendering them more susceptible to injury and reduced performance levels. Even elite athletes need to warm up before engaging in any form of physical or sports activity. Warming up prepares the body for the upcoming exertion and can prevent injuries, enhance performance, and increase overall stamina. In conclusion, the Blue team had fewer athletes with increased blood flow to the muscles before the race, due to their lack of a proper warm-up session."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\".

I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: This activity probably took: Options: A. A day B. A week C. not enough information D. A month Answer:","completion":"D. A month"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Palestinian Authority declared three days of mourning and closed Palestinian schools. Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh suggested, \\"This is the moment Sheikh Yassin dreamed about\\". The Hamas leadership said Ariel Sharon had \\"opened the gates of hell.\\" Hamas called for retaliation against Israel. About 200,000 people took to the streets of the Gaza Strip for Yassin's funeral as Israeli forces declared a national alert. The assassination of Yassin also led to the fact that Hamas, for the first time, named as the most popular movement in Palestine by the residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip two weeks after the assassination. Abdel Aziz Rantisi was announced as the new head of Hamas. At a memorial service for Sheik Yassin, he declared that \\"The Israelis will not know security... We will fight them until the liberation of Palestine, the whole of Palestine.\\" Publicly addressing the \\"military wing\\" of Hamas, Rantisi suggested, \\"The door is open for you to strike all places, all the time and using all means.\\" Rantisi was himself killed by Israel on 17 April 2004 in an assassination almost identical to that of Yassin. He was killed by three rockets fired from a Gunship by the Israeli Military. On 31 August 2004, at least 15 Israeli people were killed and 80 injured in a suicide attack against two Israeli buses in Beersheba. Hamas stated the attack was a revenge for the assassination of Rantisi and Yassin. Following the bombing, an estimated 20,000 Hamas supporters in Gaza took to Gaza's streets, celebrating the successful attack.

Marsha loves playing with her noodle friend. She had it for a long time so it is now a dark brown color. When her mom first made it, it was white. The night she met her noodle friend was spaghetti night. Marsha's favorite dinner was spaghetti, which happened to be every Tuesday night. On one Tuesday, a piece of spaghetti fell on the kitchen floor. To Marsha, it looked like a stick man so she kept him. She named her new noodle friend Joey and took him everywhere she went. Sometimes Joey gets a little dried out so Marsha's mom told her to soak him in water every few days. There were a couple times that the family dog, Mika, has tried to take Joey from Marsha and eat him! So from now on, Marsha takes extra special care to make sure Joey is safe and sound at all times. During the day she keeps him in a plastic bag in her pocket. At night, she puts him under her pillow. She loves Joey and wants to always be friends with him.

Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water. The evaporation of water is a physical change. So yes, temperature affects the rate that physical change occurs.

Answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House. The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports. But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office. Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers. \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded. \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added. The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea. Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\" Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs. Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president can initiate a probe to determine if imports threaten national security. \\"It's about our economy,\\" Vice President Mike Pence during the meeting. \\"It's about our national security.\\" Trade was a major topic for Trump during the presidential campaign he vowed to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports and a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports.

'If he was up to it, he would have done it,' Kerrey tells MailOnline.","completion":"Once upon a time, there was a man named Kerrey. He was a two-term Senator, which means he was an important person who helped make decisions for the country. Kerrey lived during the '80s and '90s, which was a long time ago. One day, Kerrey found out that the president (the boss of the country) was doing something he didn't like. The president was making changes to the way people get help from doctors and hospitals. This was called \\"Obamacare.\\" Kerrey thought these changes might not be good for the U.S. economy. The economy is like the big piggy bank that helps the country buy things and pay people for their work. Kerrey also heard that the president told people, \\"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\\" But this was not true. It was a little like when someone tells a fib about what they did with their toys. Kerrey thought the president should have known better and not told that fib. Kerrey thought there was another fib going around too. Some people, called Democrats, were saying that \\"everybody\\" could get \\"high-quality, affordable health care.\\" High-quality means really good, and affordable means it doesn't cost too much. Kerrey didn't think it was true that everyone could get this kind of help from doctors and hospitals. Then, Kerrey looked at the president again. He realized that the president might not be brave enough to work with both Democrats and Republicans. These are groups of people who have different ideas about how to run the country. Kerrey thought that if the president was really brave, he would bring these groups together to talk about how to save things like Social Security and Medicare. Those are programs that help older and sick people. But it looked like those programs might run out of money if they didn't find a solution. So, Kerrey talked to some people, called MailOnline, and shared his thoughts. He said, \\"If the president was up to it, he would have done it already.\\" That means that Kerrey thought the president might not have what it takes to fix these big problems. And that's the story of Kerrey, the two-term senator who was disappointed with the president and how he was handling big situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

More Photos » BEIRUT, Lebanon — Fighting seized neighborhoods encircling Damascus for a fifth straight day on Thursday, a day after President Bashar al-Assad’s key security aides were killed in a brazen bombing attack in the sharply escalating conflict. The bombing, close to Mr. Assad’s own residence, called into question the ability of a government that depends on an insular group of loyalists to function effectively as it battles a strengthening opposition. In a move to dispel any rumors that he had been injured or had left the capital, Mr. Assad appeared on state television on Thursday swearing in a new defense minister in what appeared to be a reception room at the presidential palace. The images were broadcast in a continuous loop on SANA. The outlook for a peaceful outcome to the conflict darkened further on Thursday, when Russia and China vetoed a Britain-sponsored resolution at the United Nations Security Council that would have penalized Mr. Assad’s government with sanctions for the first time for failing to implement the six-point peace plan negotiated by Kofi Annan, the special Syria envoy. The double veto also called into question the viability of a 300-member United Nations mission sent to Syria to monitor the peace plan. Its mandate expires Friday. Opposition activists reported battles between the Army and opposition forces in the southern district of Damascus and in the northern suburb of Qaboun, with residents who were not trapped by fighting fleeing many areas. In a second statement in two days, the Syrian military said on Thursday that the bombing had left it more determined to “clear the homeland of the armed terrorist groups” — the term it uses for the insurgents seeking Mr. Assad’s ouster. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain, said that the government assault had intensified, with more helicopters firing rockets that were igniting and destroying houses in Qaboun. It said that snipers were deployed around the exits of the neighborhood and that water and electricity had been cut off with numerous families trapped and no one able to excavate dead bodies from the rubble. One activist reached in Damascus, using only the name Omar, said that the government had been asking residents of Tadamon and parts of Yarmouk, the capital’s southern neighborhoods, to leave their homes. That is usually a sign that government forces are on the verge of a violent attack. Residents of Mezze and Kafr Sousseh, western neighborhoods even closer to the center of the city, fled unprompted because of the intensity of the shelling there, activists said. Another activist, Ali Salem, said residents of some five districts of the southern districts of the capital had been warned to leave and those neighborhoods were largely empty. “They threatened them and gave them 24 hours to leave their homes or they will be shelled,” he said. At least some of the Assad family has left Damascus. One opposition figure said a person associated with air force intelligence told him that a plane left Mezze military airfield in Damascus on Wednesday afternoon for Latakia carrying Mr. Assad’s mother, Anisa al-Assad, the widow of the former president Hafez al-Assad; his wife, Asma, and their three children, and other women and children from the family. It is possible the family is gathering for a ceremony at the family mausoleum in Qardaha, above Latakia, to bury Asef Shawkat, the most significant of those who died in the attack on Wednesday. Mr. Shawkat, the former deputy chief of staff of the military and the husband of the president’s older sister, Bushra, was killed along with Defense Minister Dawoud A. Rajha, the most prominent Christian in the government, and Maj. Gen. Hassan Turkmani, a previous defense minister serving as the top military aide to Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa. The strike dealt a potent blow to the government, as much for where it took place as for the individuals who were targeted: the very cabinet ministers and intelligence chiefs who have coordinated the government’s iron-fisted approach to the uprising. The battle for the capital, the center of Assad family power, appears to have begun. Reporting was contributed by Dalal Mawad and Hwaida Saad from Beirut; Alan Cowell from London; Matthew Rosenberg from Kabul, Afghanistan; Rick Gladstone from New York; Ellen Barry from Moscow; Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem; Elisabeth Bumiller and Eric Schmitt from Washington; and an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The text discusses a series of significant events in Syria resulting from ongoing conflict which escalated due to an attack close to President Bashar al-Assad's residence. This event brought mounting doubts about the government's ability to function amidst the increasing strength of the opposition. First, continuous fighting for five consecutive days took hold of neighborhoods surrounding Damascus. A bombing attack was carried out near President Assad’s residence, leading to the death of his key security aides. This signified an escalating conflict and raised concerns over the ability of Assad’s administration, which relies heavily on a loyalist group, to function effectively amidst the strengthening opposition. In an attempt to dispel rumors about any injury he could have sustained, or that he had escaped the capital, Mr. Assad appeared on state television swearing in a new defense minister, with the images being continuously televised on SANA. Second, the possibility of a peaceful resolution to the situation in Syria suffered a setback as Russia and China vetoed a resolution sponsored by Britain at the United Nations Security Council. This resolution aimed to sanction Mr. Assad’s government for the first time for their failure to implement the peace plan negotiated by Kofi Annan, the special Syria envoy. Third, opposition activists witnessed increasing battles between the army and opposition forces in southern Damascus and its northern suburb, Qaboun. The Syrian military stated that the bombing had only strengthened its resolution to take down opposition groups, termed ‘armed terrorist groups’. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based organization, asserts that the government attacks have increased, causing massive damage to homes and infrastructure. Snipers have reportedly surrounded areas of conflict while services like water and electricity have been shut off, resulting in trapped civilians and no means of recovering bodies from destroyed structures. Lastly, it was reported that some members of the Assad family have fled Damascus after being warned by the government about a possible surge in violent attacks. Others left due to the intensity of shelling in their areas. This state of affairs appears to signal that a significant confrontation for control of the capital city, which is the heart of Assad family's rule, has begun. Taken together, these points demonstrate the escalating violence and tension in Syria, causing considerable doubt over the future stability of President Assad’s government."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, the premise \\"Killing's not my first skill\\" entails the hypothesis \\"My first skill wouldn't be killing.\\" To break it down, let's analyze both the premise and the hypothesis: 1. Premise: \\"Killing's not my first skill.\\" This statement implies that the speaker does not consider killing to be their primary or most proficient skill. It is an outright declaration that they possess other skills that they prioritize or excel at over killing. 2. Hypothesis: \\"My first skill wouldn't be killing.\\" This statement refers to the assumption that if the speaker's primary skill or most proficient expertise were assessed, it wouldn't be killing. The hypothesis is drawn based on the information provided in the premise. Given the analysis, we can see that the hypothesis is a restatement of the premise with a minor change in phrasing. The hypothesis mirrors the sentiment expressed in the premise and is, therefore, entailed by it. In essence, both the premise and the hypothesis communicate the same idea - that killing is not the speaker's primary or most proficient skill.

Article: 08/19/2010 AP Advisory AP Standards Center issues staff advisory on covering New York City mosque Associated Press Deputy Managing Editor for Standards and Production Tom Kent sent the following note to the staff about covering the New York City mosque story and then discussed the guidance and reaction in a Facebook entry headlined \\"Behind the News: Describing the proposed NYC mosque.\\" Aug. 19, 2010 Colleagues, Here is some guidance on covering the NYC mosque story, with assists from Chad Roedemeier in the NYC bureau and Terry Hunt in Washington: 1. We should continue to avoid the phrase \\"ground zero mosque\\" or \\"mosque at ground zero\\" on all platforms. (We’ve very rarely used this wording, except in slugs, though we sometimes see other news sources using the term.) The site of the proposed Islamic center and mosque is not at ground zero, but two blocks away in a busy commercial area. We should continue to say it’s “near” ground zero, or two blocks away. WE WILL CHANGE OUR SLUG ON THIS STORY LATER TODAY from “BC-Ground Zero Mosque” to “BC-NYC Mosque.” In short headlines, some ways to refer to the project include: _ mosque 2 blocks from WTC site _ Muslim (or Islamic) center near WTC site _ mosque near ground zero _ mosque near WTC site We can refer to the project as a mosque, or as a proposed Islamic center that includes a mosque. It may be useful in some stories to note that Muslim prayer services have been held since 2009 in the building that the new project will replace. The proposal is to create a new, larger Islamic community center that would include a mosque, a swimming pool, gym, auditorium and other facilities. 2. Here is a succinct summary of President Obama’s position: Obama has said he believes Muslims have the right to build an Islamic center in New York as a matter of religious freedom, though he's also said he won't take a position on whether they should actually build it. For additional background, you’ll find below a Fact Check on the project that moved yesterday. Tom --- Slug: BC-US--Mosque-Fact Check Byline: CALVIN WOODWARD Bytitle: Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — A New York imam and his proposed mosque near ground zero are being demonized by political candidates — mostly Republicans — despite the fact that Islam is already very much a part of the World Trade Center neighborhood. And that Muslims pray inside the Pentagon, too, less than 80 feet from where terrorists attacked. And that the imam who's being branded an extremist has been valued by both Republican and Democratic administrations as a moderate face of the faith. Even so, the project stirs complicated emotions, and Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf is a complex figure who defies easy categorization in the American Muslim world. He's devoted much of his career to working closely with Christians, Jews and secular leaders to advance interfaith understanding. He's scolded his own religion for being in some ways in the \\"Dark Ages.\\" Yet he's also accused the U.S. of spilling more innocent blood than al-Qaida, the terrorist network that turned the World Trade Center, part of the Pentagon and four hijacked airplanes to apocalyptic rubble. Many Republicans and some Democrats say the proposed 100 million Islamic cultural center and mosque should be built elsewhere, where there is no possible association with New York's ground zero. Far more than a local zoning issue, the matter has seized congressional campaigns, put President Barack Obama and his party on the spot — he says Muslims have the right to build the mosque — divided families of the Sept. 11, 2001, victims, caught the attention of Muslims abroad and threatened to blur distinctions between mainstream Islam in the U.S. and its radical elements. A look at some of the claims and how they compare with the known facts: ___ —\\"The folks who want to build this mosque — who are really radical Islamists who want to triumphally prove that they can build a mosque right next to a place where 3,000 Americans were killed by radical Islamists — those folks don't have any interest in reaching out to the community. They're trying to make a case about supremacy.\\" — Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a potential 2012 presidential candidate. —Some of the Muslim leaders associated with the mosque \\"are clearly terrorist sympathizers.\\" — Kevin Calvey, a Republican running for Congress in Oklahoma. —\\"This radical is a terrible choice to be one of the faces of our country overseas.\\" — Statement by GOP Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida and Peter King of New York. THE FACTS: No one has established a link between the cleric and radicals. New York Police Department spokesman Paul Browne said, \\"We've identified no law enforcement issues related to the proposed mosque.\\" Ros-Lehtinen and King were referring to the State Department's plan, predating the mosque debate, to send Rauf on another religious outreach trip to the Middle East as part of his \\"long-term relationship\\" with U.S. officials in the Bush and Obama administrations. The State Department said Wednesday it will pay him 3,000 for a trip costing the government 16,000. Rauf counts former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright from the Clinton administration as a friend and appeared at events overseas or meetings in Washington with former President George W. Bush's secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, and Bush adviser Karen Hughes. He has denounced the terrorist attacks and suicide bombing as anti-Islamic and has criticized Muslim nationalism. But he's made provocative statements about America, too, calling it an \\"accessory\\" to the 9/11 attacks and attributing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children to the U.S.-led sanctions in the years before the invasion. In a July 2005 speech at the Bob Hawke Prime Ministerial Center in Adelaide, Australia, Rauf said, according to the center's transcript: \\"We tend to forget, in the West, that the United States has more Muslim blood on its hands than al-Qaida has on its hands of innocent non-Muslims.\\" While calling terrorism unjustified, he said the U.S. has supported authoritarian regimes with heinous human rights records and, faced with that, \\"how else do people get attention?\\" In the same address, he spoke of prospects for peace between Palestinians and the Israelis — who he said \\"have moved beyond Zionism\\" — and of a love-your-neighbor ethic uniting all religions. ___ —\\"Mr. President, ground zero is the wrong place for a mosque.\\" — Rick Scott, Republican candidate for Florida governor. —\\"Nazis don't have the right to put up a sign next to the Holocaust Museum in Washington. We would never accept the Japanese putting up a site next to Pearl Harbor. There's no reason for us to accept a mosque next to the World Trade Center.\\" — Gingrich. —\\"Just a block or two away from 9/11.\\" — Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, another 2012 GOP presidential prospect. THE FACTS: No mosque is going up at ground zero. The center would be established at 45-51 Park Place, just over two blocks from the northern edge of the sprawling, 16-acre World Trade Center site. Its location is roughly half a dozen normal lower Manhattan blocks from the site of the North Tower, the nearer of the two destroyed in the attacks. The center's location, in a former Burlington Coat Factory store, is already used by the cleric for worship, drawing a spillover from the imam's former main place for prayers, the al-Farah mosque. That mosque, at 245 West Broadway, is about a dozen blocks north of the World Trade Center grounds. Another, the Manhattan Mosque, stands five blocks from the northeast corner of the World Trade Center site. To be sure, the center's association with 9/11 is intentional and its location is no geographic coincidence. The building was damaged in the Sept. 11 attacks and the center's planners say they want the center to stand as a statement against terrorism. ___ —\\"There should be no mosque near ground zero in New York so long as there are no churches or synagogues in Saudi Arabia. ... America is experiencing an Islamist cultural-political offensive designed to undermine and destroy our civilization.\\" — Gingrich. —\\"This religion's plan is to destroy our way of life. ... If we have to let them build it, make them build it nine stories underground, so we can walk above it as citizens and Christians.\\" — Ron McNeil, a House GOP candidate in the Florida Panhandle, in an exchange reported by The News Herald in Panama City. THE FACTS: Such opinions are shared by some Americans, while others are more reluctant to paint the religion with a broad brush and more welcoming of the faith in this country. Bush, himself, while criticized at the time for stirring suspicions about American Muslims, traveled to a Washington mosque less than a week after the attacks to declare that terrorism is \\"not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace.\\" In any event, the U.S. armed forces field Muslim troops and make accommodations for them. The Pentagon opened an interfaith chapel in November 2002 close to the area where hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 slammed into the building, killing 184 people. Muslims gather there for a daily prayer service Monday through Thursday and hold a weekly worship service on Fridays, drawing no complaints. Similar but separate services are provided for other faiths. ___ Associated Press writers Tom Hays in New York and Anne Flaherty in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| By Doug Powers • August 19, 2010 04:34 PM **Written by Doug Powers The Associated Press is now prohibiting its staff from using the words “Ground Zero mosque” in stories: The Associated Press, one of world’s most powerful news organizations, issued a memo today advising staff to avoid the phrase “Ground Zero mosque.” The Upshot reported Tuesday that the AP started using the phrase “Ground Zero mosque” in some headlines in late May. The New York Times, for one, has consciously avoided that phrasing. The AP began using the phrase as the controversy over the proposed Islamic cultural center and mosque in Lower Manhattan started bubbling up to the national level. Many news organizations, across platforms, routinely dub the project the “Ground Zero Mosque.” The AP has always been clear in the text of stories that the project would be built two blocks from Ground Zero and not on the actual site. But AP headlines, at times, ran with the phrase adopted by opponents of the project and amplified by the media. Now the news organization is taking steps to make sure that no longer occurs. The AP memo is here. Give it a read and see if you think it’s simply a re-tread of a pro-mosque talking points memo (including a quote reminding AP staff that “the United States has more Muslim blood on its hands than al-Qaida has on its hands of innocent non-Muslims”). Fortunately for AP fact checkers, this mosque debate is taking place in between Sarah Palin book releases. There’s no official line around the WTC site where “ground zero” ends, however I’m fairly certain that if the Associated Press office was two blocks away and hit by debris on 9/11, we’d be reading AP stories about “the horror we experienced at Ground Zero” to this day. In any case, since “Ground Zero Mosque” is officially a no-no for the AP, here are a couple of suggestions for Associated Press writers to choose from to get us started. They could even use these on a rotating basis to avoid repetition. Feel free to add to this short list and I’ll try and put some of them up when I get home later: -“The Hope & Change Experience” -“House of worship in relative proximity to where Russell Simmons believes Christians bombed the WTC” -“Project Bloomberg” -“Site very far from WTC crater where faulty landing gear struck a now defunct Burlington Coat Factory turned peaceful multi-faith cultural center” -“TAI Fridays” Update: Naturally, nutmuffin Florida Rep. Alan Grayson has opined. After blaming 9/11 on Bush (of course), Grayson referred to the Ground Zero mosque as an “athletic center” and a “health club” — which is about as wildly exaggerated as calling Grayson a “lucid Congressman”: Update II: Doug Ross collected some of the best of your suggestions: Here’s just a sampling of some great ideas: 15. Landing Gear Mosque 14. Project Bloomberg 13. 9/11 Victory Mosque 12. Daily Kosque 11. Caliphate-on-Hudson 10. The Gorelick & Clarke Building 9. Mosque formerly known as the Ground Zero Mosque 8. Hamosque 7. Crater’s Edge 6. Bullseye 5. The Mohammed Atta Memorial 4. Hormel House 3. The Debris Field Mosque 2. Burlington Terrorist Factory 1. New York Fire Training Academy Awesome job!

Karen Harned is executive director of Small Business Legal Center for the National Federation of Independent Business. The group, along with 26 states, will appear at the court's oral arguments. NFIB represents 350,000 small-business owners. (Ron Pollack, founding executive director of Families USA, is for the health care reform law. Read his viewpoint here). The following interview with Harned is edited for clarity and brevity:. CNN: Has the U.S. reached a health care crisis that justified the law supported by President Barack Obama and most Democrats in Congress? Karen Harned: \\"We strongly think that our system is broken, and NFIB for two decades has been aggressively fighting for health insurance reforms. The reforms we wanted unfortunately were not included in the final law. They were reforms that would not drive down the cost of health insurance. That has been the number one issue for small-business owners. \\"We are very much not of the 'just say no' crowd, we think the status quo is not acceptable. Our members are very vocal on that. The problem is that the reforms that we advocated were the ones that ended up landing on the cutting room floor and that Congress made a bad situation worse.\\" Preview: 'The implications ... are impossible to overstate' CNN: But proponents argue there are tax incentives and other benefits designed to help small businesses provide health coverage for their small staffs. Harned: \\"Of course, there are provisions in this law that small-business owners like. On the big picture, our small-business owners don't get to pick and choose which provisions of the law apply to them, in addition to the two better provisions. There are numerous new tax increases, but there's also an unconstitutional infringement of individual liberty in the form of individual mandates that require everyone to buy health insurance or pay a fine. So at the end of the day, the small-business owners that we represent saw more bad than good. \\"The tax credit has been highlighted by the administration as something that's great for small business, but what we have found is that most of our members are not going to get that full credit. And the extent to which they get that credit, it's just not that significant. Because the amount of the tax incentive goes down as you either add employees or pay them more. It's actually disincentivizing small-business owners to grow their businesses.\\" CNN: Why in your view is the individual mandate requiring most Americans to purchase some form of health issuance an unconstitutional provision? Harned: \\"If it's upheld, then the Constitution is essentially giving Congress the authority to create a command-and-control economy. This is about them telling us all sorts of things that we have to buy or contracts that we need to enter into. This is exactly the opposite of what we want to see -- Congress telling you where you need to be shopping, what you need to buy. Two families, two viewpoints on health reform. \\"It also is just amending decades -- maybe centuries -- of contract law because you always have two willing participants. Those are things that fundamentally strike at the core of the small-business owners that I represent; it offends them to no end. As a practical matter, there are dollars and cents attached to this. I've talked to members who say, 'Look, this is a no-brainer.' \\" CNN: So you worry the federal government would only expand its authority over commerce? Harned: \\"The government has only made this worse in how they've argued this case, because they've been unable in every court they've been in before, to say where it would end. \\"As recently as the federal D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals case, where Judge [Laurence] Silberman asked them [the Justice Department lawyers] point blank, 'Is it unconstitutional to regulate broccoli?' and [the government lawyer] said, 'Well, it depends.' Now it's like we're not citizens of this country anymore, we're merely subjects, if this individual mandate goes through.\\" CNN: Should Congress start all over and craft a new health care bill? Harned: \\"NFIB went into this with the intention of striking down the entire law. We have demanded for decades that we get health insurance reform that drives down the cost of health insurance for small-business owners because that market is severely broken. \\"We also believe, as the government has continued to argue, that the individual mandate is key, integral, to its operation. Without the individual mandate, it cannot stand. Even some of the provisions that people think are relatively extraneous come back, at least from a cost perspective, to the individual mandate. And if you don't have that, how does the rest of it work? \\"... And the answer here is clearly no, because the two things that the law was said to be accomplishing were to increase coverage. The individual mandate is very key to increasing coverage. And reducing costs -- again by getting everybody into the pool, they're basically having the young, healthy people subsidizing the older population. That is supposed to be helping to lower costs for all. \\"When you take that out, we don't see how the entire law works as Congress intended. And we definitely don't think Congress would have passed it without the individual mandate.\\" CNN: What is your message to the Supreme Court as they take on this legal challenge? Harned: \\"We think the law is on our side. We think it's very clear that the Founding Fathers never intended to see Congress telling people what products they should buy. If you look at the justifications the government gives, the text doesn't support this mandate, the Constitution doesn't support it, and if the justices rule that the individual mandate is constitutional, they are going to basically open the door for Congress to legislate whatever mandates it finds appropriate that it will impose on individuals. \\"We think the law, the Constitution, is very much on our side. That's what they're charged with upholding.\\" What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1. Both experts acknowledge that the U.S. healthcare system is broken and in need of reform. 2. Karen Harned argues that the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) has been fighting for health insurance reforms, but the proposals they supported were not included in the final law. 3. Harned believes that the current health care reform law has more negative aspects than positive ones for small-business owners. She claims that the tax credits offered to small businesses are not as beneficial as the government claims, and in some cases, they may disincentivize business growth. 4. Harned is against the individual mandate requiring most Americans to purchase health insurance, calling it an unconstitutional provision. She argues that if upheld, this would give Congress too much power to regulate and control the economy. 5. The NFIB argues that if the individual mandate is removed, the rest of the health care reform law cannot stand, as it is integral to its operation. Harned suggests that Congress should start over and craft a new healthcare bill. 6. As the Supreme Court prepares to take on this legal challenge, Harned feels that the law and the Constitution support their stance against the individual mandate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After being forced overboard by smugglers, the survivors found themselves in a precarious situation, desperately needing help and hope for a brighter future. The lives of these refugees take a turn for the better when both local and international communities come together to create opportunities and uplift them from their despair. The tragic incident garners significant global attention and prompts a substantial increase in funding for refugee assistance programs. The United Nations, the UNHCR, and multiple NGOs become highly involved in efforts to improve the lives of these displaced individuals in Yemen and other countries hosting refugees. Local communities in Yemen are cautious but welcoming to the survivors, offering support and sanctuary. Some of the refugees find solace in Aden and Ahwar, where they are given temporary shelter and aid by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Multiple nations also come forward to provide aid and technical support to Yemen, helping uplift the local residents in the process. With increased focus on education and vocational training, many of the refugees manage to rebuild their lives, learning new trades and integrating into their host communities. The unity and collaboration between the various nations, NGOs, and volunteers facilitate the creation of safe havens in multiple locations around the Horn of Africa, providing asylum to individuals fleeing economic hardship and war in their home countries. As the years progress, the situation in Somalia begins to stabilize, with peace talks yielding productive results. International efforts are directed towards rebuilding war-torn regions, creating sustainable employment opportunities, and fostering a sense of unity among the various factions. Many refugees, now skilled and educated, choose to return to their homeland and actively participate in the efforts to reconstruct their nation. This story ends on a hopeful and largely optimistic note. It speaks of healing, homecoming, and an undying commitment to building a better future.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep.

Input: Well, I can once and for all put an end to the question: 'What is the worst movie ever made...ever?' It is Flight of Fury, starring and co-written by Steven Seagal. Sure there are lots of famously bad movies, but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously.It is a Romanian-made film that speaks to just how far Romania has to go to catch up with Bollywood. It also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent Steven Seagal has become. This movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again.It was released only on video (I can't imagine why) and I suspect the workers that had to make the DVD's had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling.

The list contains a mix of characters, numbers, and strings of numbers. We can start by iterating through the list, checking each element to determine if it is an alphabetical character. We can use the isalpha() method in Python to check if an element is an alphabetical character. If so, we append the index + 1 (since the position of the 1st element is 1) to a result list. After iterating through the entire input list, we need to check if any alphabetical characters were found. If the result list is empty, that means no alphabetical characters were found, so we should return -1. Otherwise, we return the result list as it contains the positions of all alphabetical characters. Here's a code solution: \`\`\`python def find_alpha_positions(input_list): alpha_positions = [] for index, element in enumerate(input_list): if str(element).isalpha(): alpha_positions.append(index + 1) return alpha_positions if alpha_positions else -1 \`\`\` Now we can use this function to find the positions of the alphabetical elements in the given input list: \`\`\`python input_list = ['l', 'I', '7539', 'U', '3745', '9783', 'D', '5531', '4325', 'J', '9005', 'h', '6447', 't', '583', '1231'] result = find_alpha_positions(input_list) print(result) # Output: [1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 12, 14] \`\`\` As per the given input list, we have alphabetical elements at positions 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 14.

Four-star officers are often the most senior commanders in the armed services, having ranks such as (full) admiral, (full) general, or air chief marshal. This designation is also used by some armed forces that are not North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) members. - Air vice-marshal (abbreviated as AVM) is a two-star air officer rank which originated in and continues to be used by the Royal Air Force. The rank is also used by the air forces of many countries which have historical British influence and it is sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure. Air vice-marshals may be addressed generically as \\"air marshal\\". Air vice-marshal is a two-star rank and has a NATO ranking code of OF-7. It is equivalent to a rear-admiral in the Royal Navy or a major-general in the British Army or the Royal Marines. In other NATO forces, such as the United States Armed Forces and the Canadian Armed Forces, the equivalent two-star rank is major general. - A flag officer is a commissioned officer in a nation's armed forces senior enough to be entitled to fly a flag to mark the position from which the officer exercises command. - The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. Three NATO members are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states: the United States, France and the United Kingdom. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP. - An officer of three-star rank is a very senior commander in many of the armed services holding a rank described by the NATO code of OF-8. The term is also used by some armed forces which are not NATO members. Typically, three-star officers hold the rank of vice admiral, lieutenant general, or in the case of those air forces with a separate rank structure, air marshal. - Vice admiral is a senior naval flag officer rank, equivalent to lieutenant general and air marshal. A vice admiral is typically senior to a rear admiral and junior to an admiral. In many navies, vice admiral is a three-star rank with a NATO code of OF-8, although in some navies like the French Navy it is an OF-7 rank, the OF-8 code corresponding to the four-star rank of squadron vice-admiral. - Counter admiral is a rank found in many navies of the world, but no longer used in English-speaking countries, where the equivalent rank is rear admiral. The term derives from the French \\"contre-amiral\\". - The French Navy (\\"national navy\\"), informally , is the maritime arm of the French Armed Forces. Tracing its roots back to 1624 it is one of the world's oldest naval forces and historically played a key part in establishing the French colonial empire. Since the early foundings, its roles have been defined as maintaining intelligence, protecting populations, preventing crises, intervening wherever necessary to reestablish peace, and dissuading any threats against vital French interests. The Marine nationale consists of four branches: the \\"Force d'Action Navale\\", the \\"Forces Sous-marines\\", the \\"Aéronavale\\" and the \\"Fusiliers Marins\\" (including Commandos Marine). As a blue-water navy the Marine nationale operates a wide range of fighting vessels, including a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, nuclear-powered submarines, frigates, patrol boats and support ships. The French Navy does not use prefixes of the names of its ships (such as the Royal Navy uses HMS, for instance). Foreign commentators sometimes use the prefixes \\"FS\\" (for \\"French Ship\\") or FNS (for \\"French Navy Ship\\"); these are not official, however. - An officer of two-star rank is a senior commander in many of the armed services holding a rank described by the NATO code of OF-7. The term is also used by some armed forces which are not NATO members. Typically, two-star officers hold the rank of rear admiral, counter admiral, major general, or in the case of those air forces with a separate rank structure, air vice-marshal. - Lieutenant general, lieutenant-general and similar (abbrev Lt Gen, LTG and similar) is a three-star military rank (NATO code OF-8) used in many countries. The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages, where the title of lieutenant general was held by the second in command on the battlefield, who was normally subordinate to a captain general. - Rear admiral is a naval commissioned officer rank above that of a commodore and captain , and below that of a vice admiral . It is generally regarded as the lowest of the \`\` admiral '' ranks , which are also sometimes referred to as \`\` flag officers '' or \`\` flag ranks '' . In many navies it is referred to as a two - star rank ( OF - 7 ) . It originated from the days of naval sailing squadrons and can trace its origins to the Royal Navy . Each naval squadron would be assigned an admiral as its head , who would command from the centre vessel and direct the activities of the squadron . The admiral would in turn be assisted by a vice admiral , who commanded the lead ships which would bear the brunt of a naval battle . In the rear of the naval squadron , a third admiral would command the remaining ships and , as this section of the squadron was considered to be in the least danger , the admiral in command of the rear would typically be the most junior of the squadron admirals . This has survived into the modern age , with the rank of rear admiral the most - junior of the admiralty ranks of many navies . In some European navies ( e.g. , that of France ) , and in the Canadian Forces ' French rank translations , the rank of rear admiral is known as contre - amiral . In the German Navy the rank is known as Konteradmiral , superior to the flotilla admiral ( Commodore in other navies ) . In the Royal Netherlands Navy , this rank is known as schout - bij - nacht ( lit. : supervisor during night ) , denoting the role junior to the squadron admiral , and fleet admiral . - Air marshal (Air Mshl or AM) is a three-star air-officer rank which originated in and continues to be used by the Royal Air Force. The rank is also used by the air forces of many countries which have historical British influence and it is sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure. Air marshal is a three-star rank and has a NATO ranking code of OF-8, equivalent to a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy or a lieutenant-general in the British Army or the Royal Marines. In other NATO forces, such as the United States Armed Forces and the Canadian Armed Forces, the equivalent three-star rank is lieutenant general.

Margaret Coker has the latest on the situation in Libya as Moammar Gadhafi's hold on power eroded further Thursday as rebels fought with pro-Gadhafi forces near the capital, Tripoli. Plus, what 48 million will buy you in Aspen. BENGHAZI, Libya—Rebels menaced Col. Moammar Gadhafi's stronghold from all sides Thursday, as insurgent commanders said they have sent troops for an offensive against Tripoli and residents of the capital prepared their first mass demonstration in days on Friday. Just 30 miles west of Col. Gadhafi's shrinking base of power, antiregime forces battled for the oil-industry town of Al-Zawiya. On Thursday evening, opposition forces gained control of Misrata, a coastal city 130 miles east of Tripoli. In Benghazi, the country's second-largest city and the hub of eastern Libya, a group of army colonels who recently defected said they are plotting the end their former commander's 42-year reign, which began to crumble last week as Libyans joined the antiauthoritarian protests roiling the Arab world. \\"We have a plan to bring down Tripoli,\\" Col. Tareq Saad Hussein, one of seven former colonels who have taken charge of rebel forces in Benghazi, said in an interview. \\"We will not stop until we liberate the whole country.\\" {if djIsFlashPossible} The version of Adobe Flash Player required to view this interactive has not been found.

Hussein said his team had already begun sending rebels west toward Tripoli in small groups to slip past forces loyal to Col. Gadhafi. Tripoli residents, meanwhile, said antiregime groups sent a wave of text messages Thursday urging residents to meet en masse Friday for prayers at the city's Green Square as a sign of defiance against Col. Gadhafi. Several residents who participated in Sunday's large demonstration in Tripoli say heavy patrols by government forces have made the streets dangerous for protesters. Some say they hope Friday's event will be a turning point. \\"We will go and gather, even if we are slaughtered,\\" said one resident.

Governments across the world continued their attempts Thursday to evacuate their citizens from Libya. Germany and the U.K. sent warships to retrieve nationals. A ferry loaded with U.S. passengers continued to await departure in Tripoli's port Thursday amid high winds and rough seas, complicating U.S. efforts to take diplomatic action against Col. Gadhafi. On Thursday, President Barack Obama consulted with European leaders while Washington explored a full range of options. Asked whether the U.S. was considering military steps, White House spokesman Jay Carney said: \\"I'm not ruling anything out.\\" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Col. Gadhafi had told the U.S. through Libyan officials that his opponents are inspired by Islamists and under the influence of drugs, a message that has mirrored his statements on Libyan state television. In an interview with David Wessel, Daniel Yergin, author of \\"The Prize,\\" states that the turmoil in the Middle East is a \\"sea change\\" for the global oil market and that the U.S. and emerging markets are most economically vulnerable to rising oil prices. Col. Gadhafi lashed out at his domestic opponents again Thursday in a 23-minute telephone interview with state television, accusing rebels in Al-Zawiya and elsewhere of being under the sway of al Qaeda. \\"What is this farce? You in al-Zawiya turn to [Osama] bin Laden?\\" he said. \\"He brainwashed your sons.\\" While Libya does have a history of homegrown terrorism, Col. Gadhafi's more immediate concern appears to be the new military units commanded by Col. Hussein and other former officers around the country. Libya has long required its men to serve in the military, making the regulars, reservists and former soldiers who make up these militias familiar with arms. Residents of Tajura, a suburb of Tripoli, say pro-government militias have fought running battles against local youths amid ongoing street protests by residents in defiance of Col. Gadhafi's speech Tuesday that promised death to demonstrators. The residents were taking inspiration from rousing sermons issued by a notable religious leader, Sheikh al-Geryani. \\"He spoke up,\\" says one resident about the religious leader. \\"He was telling the people that we can't let them kill us. Now they have raided his house and are looking for him.\\" Tajura youth groups have fought running gun battles with pro-regime forces for the three nights leading up to Thursday night, according to residents. But the government has moved in tanks and set up road blocks on most main streets of the town, and so far remain in control over the area, residents say. In Benghazi, Col. Hussein said he and other colonels had dispatched armed rebels west toward Tripoli in small units, to make it difficult to detect them passing through territories including the city of Sirte, the heavily fortifieed hometown of Col. Gadhafi and his still-loyal tribesmen. Col. Hussein wouldn't say how many fighters had been sent to Tripoli and wouldn't comment on when a larger scale westward offensive might be launched. Idriss Sherif, an economics professor who is serving on one of Benghazi's newly formed leadership committees, said he believed that over 1,000 rebel troops had already been dispatched to Tripoli. At the Benghazi compound's front gate, two antiaircraft guns pointed skyward. Inside, in the shade of eucalyptus and palm trees, soldiers piled dozens of wooden crates filled with tank shells into a pickup truck. The soldiers said the compound now served as depot where weapons seized by young protesters from army bases and police stations were gathered and redistributed to trained rebel fighters. Col. Hussein, speaking as he picked over a lunch of grilled chicken and macaroni, said his forces were also working to hunt down Col. Gadhafi. Col. Hussein said intelligence from friendly senior army officers with whom he is in contact throughout Libya suggested Col. Gadhafi was moving from house to house to avoid detection. He said there were strong indications that Col. Gadhafi's hold on power was fast slipping. Some of Benghazi's new officials said their contacts in Sirte told them that Mr. Gadhafi's intelligence chief, Abdullah Senussi, had bolted the city Thursday, along with the unit of soldiers protecting him. Col. Hussein said his forces had recently been contacted by some members of Col. Gadhafi's tribe in and around Sirte who said they no longer supported Col. Gadhafi. \\"Gadhafi's days are numbered,\\" said Col. Hussein. \\"If we capture him, he will be publicly prosecuted for his crimes. But if the youth find him first, I don't think I'll see Gadhafi in less than 40 or 50 pieces.\\" Meanwhile, Col. Hussein and other rebel commanders say their forces are motivated and gaining in strength, numbers and organization with each day. There was no way to confirm these rebel reports. At the headquarters of Benghazi's interim governing committees, dozens of youth lined up Thursday to sign up. \\"We've opened the doors for volunteers in the new army, to unite and fight against the mercenaries and liberate all of Libya,\\" said Akram Akaza, a 36-year-old corporal who was directing the volunteers to the sign-up lists. \\"We must get Gadhafi out. I'm going to Tripoli.\\" Senior rebel commanders in other eastern cities said similar efforts were underway there. \\"We are getting many volunteers every day,\\" said Maj. Gen. Suleiman Mahmoud, who is headquartered in Tobruq. Gen. Mahmoud was the commander of the armed forces in eastern Libya—making him one of Col. Hussein's seniors—under Col. Gadhafi before he defected to the rebels on Sunday. Gen. Mahmoud said his rebel forces were also preparing a march on Tripoli. But it was unclear how much coordination there was between efforts in different cities. Col. Hussein and Gen. Mahmoud both said coordination was good. But neither, when asked Thursday, seemed aware of what the other was doing. Gen. Mahmoud is among a small group of top ranking Libyan defense officials who appear to be playing a key role in the rebellion. Another senior military figure in the uprising is Abdel Fattah Younis, who was Libya's defense minister until he defected to the rebels on Sunday. Mr. Younis was helping rebels days before that, according to some rebel officials in Benghazi. Mr. Younis's leadership was key to drawing up and executing the operation that brought down Benghazi's principal pro-Gadhafi military base, which collapsed late Sunday night, according to Mr. Sherif. \\"He was the one giving orders that day,\\" said Mr. Sherif. \\"He commands the loyalty of officers throughout all of Libya.\\" But some rebel soldiers and loyalists voiced distrust of both Gen. Mahmoud and Mr. Younis, because they served for so long and in such a senior capacity. Asked about his views on Gen. Mahmoud and Mr. Younis, Col. Hussein would only say: \\"There are officers with high ranks who had very nebulous positions toward the revolution until the last minute. These officers should have declared their support earlier.\\" —Angus Mcdowall, Nour Malas and Summer Said contributed to this article. Write to Charles Levinson at charles.levinson@wsj.com and Margaret Coker at margaret.coker@wsj.com ||||| BENGHAZI, LIBYA - Fighting between Libyan opposition groups and government paramilitary forces moved closer to the capital, Tripoli, on Thursday, as residents braced for a potential push to oust Moammar Gaddafi's regime from the city. With opposition leaders calling for major protests in Tripoli on Friday, residents said jeeps full of armed fighters were moving into the city from a nearby military barracks. \\"Fear, fear, fear,\\" one businessman described the mood in the city. But he predicted a big turnout for the Friday demonstrations. \\"It's now or never,\\" he said of the effort by opposition groups to extend their rebellion to Gaddafi's stronghold, where forces loyal to the Libyan leader have kept a firm grip on power. Beyond Tripoli, there were new signs Thursday that what began as a disorganized revolt was gaining strength and coherence. Parallel governments are taking shape in major cities such as Benghazi, about 600 miles east of the capital, with citizen leaders working alongside former government officials and military officers. As the clashes spread closer to the capital, rebel gains threatened to leave the Libyan leader's stronghold isolated. Forces loyal to Gaddafi appeared to have repelled their opponents in Zawiyah, 30 miles west of Tripoli, but residents of Misurata, a major town east of the capital, said that the streets were in rebel hands and that opposition members had rebuffed an attack by regime loyalists. Gaddafi has vowed to fight to the death to keep his 41-year-old rule intact, and he made a direct appeal to Zawiyah's residents, telling them that protesters had been drugged and were under the influence of al-Qaeda. \\"Please do not disappoint me,\\" Gaddafi said in a telephone call to the state-run radio station. \\"Otherwise each will take justice into his own hands to rid us of this darkness.\\" The turmoil in Libya continued to disrupt world oil markets and dominate international diplomacy as nations tried to evacuate their citizens and craft a response to the violence. U.S. officials said a ferry chartered to evacuate American citizens to nearby Malta was unable to depart Thursday because of high seas. Swiss officials said they were freezing any possible bank assets of Gaddafi and his close associates. The step was similar to one announced by Swiss authorities against the leaders of Tunisia and Egypt as they were ousted in rebellions. In Washington, President Obama called British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy amid mounting criticism that the administration's quiet diplomacy is doing little to stop the Libyan government's violent reprisals. A French government statement said Sarkozy and Obama \\"reiterated their demand for an immediate halt to the use of force against the civilian population.\\" Sarkozy also called for a second urgent session of the U.N. Security Council to demand \\"immediate access to humanitarian assistance and to sanction those responsible for the violence against Libya's civilian population.\\" Obama's telephone diplomacy Thursday came on the eve of a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, called to address the revolt in Libya. The council's European members are expected to lead the push for Libya's expulsion from the panel and support the first step in establishing a U.N.-sanctioned investigation of the violence that could end at the International Criminal Court. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is scheduled to travel to Geneva on Monday for the council's regular session. The extent of the fighting in Zawiyah could not be independently verified, but wire services and others, quoting witnesses, reported fierce clashes that included government fighters firing on a mosque where protesters had staged a sit-in. A local doctor quoted by the Associated Press said that at least 10 people were killed. Other reports put the death toll much higher. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The situation in Libya is changing as rebels fight against pro-Gadhafi forces near the capital, Tripoli.

Title: A bit overly ambitious to claim THE Best of the Blues\\" Product review: I really appreciated Robert Santelli's \\"Big Blues Book\\", but his book \\"The Best of the Blues - 101 Essential Albums\\" leaves much to be desired. I do not profess to be a blues expert, but I have been an avid fan since the mid '50s, have about 200 blues albums and know a bit about the music. The selections in the book are curious if nothing else.

The post was called Camp Meade Cantonment by 1918, Camp Franklin Signal Corps school was located there and in 1919, the Camp Benning tank school—formed from the World War I Camp Colt and Tobyhanna schools—was transferred to the fort before the Tank Corps was disbanded. Renamed to Fort Leonard Wood (February 1928 – March 5, 1929), the fort's Experimental Motorized Forces in the summer and fall of 1928 tested vehicles and tactics in expedition convoys (Camp Meade observers had joined the in-progress 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy). In 1929, the fort's 1st Tank Regiment encamped on the Gettysburg Battlefield. During World War II, Fort Meade was used as a recruit training post and prisoner of war camp, in addition to a holding center for approximately 384 Japanese, German, and Italian immigrant residents of the U.S. arrested as potential fifth columnists. The Second U.S. Army Headquarters transferred to the post on June 15, 1947; and in 1957, the post became headquarters of the National Security Agency.

Given the following context: During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.

Article:The idea came from an economist, Jim O'Neill formerly of Goldman Sachs, who thought of the group (without South Africa) as a useful way of thinking about the future of the global economy. On those rather flimsy foundations the countries built a summit and now they seem to be on the point of creating a new financial institution. If they can agree to sign up to it at a summit in Fortaleza in Brazil, the five Brics countries will create a new development bank, a new challenger to the World Bank and the ranks of other similar regionally focused agencies. They are all agreed in principle that it's something they want to do, and reports ahead of the summit suggest they are close to agreeing enough of the detail to be able to sign a founding treaty for the bank. So just what will this Brics bank look like? A lot of detail has still to be filled in, but previous summit declarations have set out some elements. Its main function would be to mobilise \\"resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in Brics and other emerging economies and developing countries\\". So it would be for the benefit of their own economies, but for others too. Infrastructure is one of the jobs that the existing development banks do. They lend money to a government to pay for projects such as power stations and electricity supply grids, ports, roads, telecommunications networks, water and sewerage. A Brics bank would bring more resources into this important area. The World Bank acknowledges that more is needed. There's a gap between what is spent on infrastructure and what is needed. The World Bank says on its website: \\"The gap is estimated at 1 trillion in low and middle-income countries, and the demand for infrastructure continues to grow as countries develop.\\" The existing development banks could not get anywhere near filling a gap of that size. Currently overseas aid, including the existing multilateral development banks, provide a small fraction of total infrastructure spending in the developing world - something like 40-60bn (Â£23-35bn) out of a total approaching a trillion. A group of three economists including the Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz have described the Brics bank as \\"an idea whose time has come\\". They saw another benefit in the idea. They wrote with the global financial crisis still in mind, a disaster where one element was money from the emerging world invested in rich country financial markets. \\"Such a bank could play a strong role in rebalancing the world economy by channelling hard-earned savings in emerging markets and developing countries to more productive uses than funding bubbles in rich-country housing markets,\\" they said. So how much will a Brics bank be able to bring to the infrastructure party? There are many moving parts in the calculation. The Brics countries are talking about total capital of as much as 100bn, though it wouldn't necessarily all be paid in. The bank's capacity to lend would depend on how much they do pay in, its credit rating, whether it gets contributions from other countries, which Brics countries have said they would allow, on what it does with any profits and many other factors. One estimate by Columbia University Prof Stephany Griffith-Jones suggested it could eventually lend as much as 34bn a year. With joint financing by private investors and other development banks, it would be supporting projects worth even more than that. But that would take 20 years and it is of course a hypothetical figure. It's a significant contribution to the developing world's needs, but it would still leave a lot of the infrastructure gap unfilled. There is more to this plan than just the financial aspects. A Brics bank would probably take a less assertive position when it comes to setting conditions attached to its loans than the World Bank, for example. Those conditions have often been controversial, with critics saying they are wrong for the countries concerned and an intrusion on their sovereignty. There is also a long standing complaint from the developing world about who is in charge at the World Bank - and the International Monetary Fund as well. The system of weighted voting gives the rich countries a very big say. It has enabled them to maintain an informal arrangement which has meant the Bank always has an American in the top job, while a European has always led the IMF. There will most likely be politically driven wrangling over the management posts at the Brics bank. But we can be pretty sure it will be one of their own nationals in charge. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are close to agreeing on the creation of a new development bank, intended to be a challenger to the World Bank and other similar financial institutions.

The initial capital discussed is around 100bn, and it could eventually lend as much as 34bn a year. A BRICS bank is expected to take a less assertive position on loan conditions and give more representation to the developing world. The proposal for the BRICS bank is seen as an idea whose time has come, and it could help rebalance the global economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Ali: Fear Eats the Soul Context: Ali (Salem), is a Moroccan Gastarbeiter (guest worker) in his late thirties, and Emmi (Mira), is a 60-year-old widowed cleaning woman. They meet when Emmi ducks inside a bar, driven by the rain and drawn by the exotic Arabic music (Al Asfouryeh by Sabah) she says she has heard so often on her walk home from work. A woman in the bar (Katharina Herberg) who is part of Ali's Arabic-speaking cohort tauntingly suggests Ali ask Emmi (\\"the old woman\\") to dance, and Emmi accepts. A strange and unlikely friendship develops, then a romance and soon they are living together in Emmi's flat. Out of a professed sense of responsibility but also hopefulness, Emmi first confides in her newfound love when she goes to visit her daughter Krista (Irm Hermann) and her tyrannical son-in-law Eugen (Fassbinder himself) and announces that she is in love with Ali; Eugen thinks she is screwy and Krista as well can only think that her mother - who has been a widow for years - is fantasizing. The first real threat to their relationship comes with a visit by the landlord's son, who has been sent on the assumption that Emmi has taken in a lodger to point out to her that sub-letting is against Emmi's tenancy agreement, and that Ali must leave within a day. Impulsively, and fearful of losing this new joy in her life, Emmi claims that she and Ali are planning to marry to alleviate this little difficulty. This changes everything for the landlord's son, the only character in the film who consistently accepts their relationship as unproblematic. After he has apologized for the misapprehension and departed, Emmi speaks to Ali with embarrassment of her having invented the idea of their marrying but, to her surprise and delight, Ali concurs that it is an excellent idea, and we next see them emerging from the civil court, married. What follows is a bitter and noxious reaction over their relationship, revealing every character in their lives, especially every German in Emmi's former life, as being mired in prejudice against foreign workers as dirty... Answer:","completion":"The idea of marriage is a complex social construct predating recorded history, and therefore it is difficult to attribute its invention to a single person or society. Marriage has evolved over time and has been influenced by various religions, cultures, and legal systems throughout human history. As a result, there are numerous different types of marriages and ceremonies practiced worldwide. Regarding the movie you mentioned, \\"Ali: Fear Eats the Soul\\" is a 1974 West German film directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. The film tells the story of an unlikely romance between Ali, a Moroccan guest worker, and Emmi, a widowed German cleaning woman, which is met with racial prejudice and societal disapproval. As their relationship develops, they face many challenges caused by discrimination and the preconceived notions about their union. In the film, the idea of marriage is brought up when Emmi and Ali have to deal with housing issues due to the restrictions on Emmi's tenancy agreement. Emmi, driven by fear of losing her newfound happiness, claims that they are planning to get married to solve the housing problem. Initially, this marriage proposal stems from a practical need, but Ali eventually agrees to it, and they proceed to marry. While the film portrays marriage as an essential part of their relationship, it also highlights the societal context surrounding intercultural marriages and the prejudice faced by individuals in such unions. Of course, this should not be mistaken as an account of how or why the idea of marriage was initially invented. The origins of marriage remain a complex and multifaceted topic deeply intertwined with human history and cultural evolution."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Answer the question...when did the first moon landing take place??","completion":"The first moon landing took place on July 20, 1969, during the historic Apollo 11 mission led by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States. This momentous event marked a significant milestone in the history of human space exploration and epitomized the culmination of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Apollo 11 mission was commanded by astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, accompanied by pilot Edwin E. \\"Buzz\\" Aldrin Jr. as Lunar Module Pilot and pilot Michael Collins as Command Module Pilot. The three-part spacecraft was launched on July 16, 1969, from the Kennedy Space Center (then named the Cape Kennedy Air Force Station) in Florida. The mission consisted of three crucial stages: launch and ascent, lunar landing, and safe return. The spacecraft with the three astronauts aboard reached Earth's orbit approximately 12 minutes after liftoff, and it traveled through space for three days before entering lunar orbit. The spacecraft then started its descent to the lunar surface. On July 20, as the Lunar Module (named \\"Eagle\\") separated from the Command and Service Module (named \\"Columbia\\"), Armstrong and Aldrin prepared for the final descent, while Collins stayed in lunar orbit. At 20:17 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the Lunar Module successfully touched down on the moon's surface in an area called the Sea of Tranquility. About six and a half hours after landing, Neil Armstrong became the first human to step onto the lunar surface, creating a historic moment immortalized by the famous phrase, \\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\\" Roughly twenty minutes later, Buzz Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface, and the two of them spent approximately 2 hours conducting experiments, collecting lunar samples, and deploying scientific instruments. The astronauts then returned to the Lunar Module and, after a period of rest, initiated the ascent back to the Command and Service Module, rendezvousing with Collins in lunar orbit. The three astronauts traveled back to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969, where they were recovered by the USS Hornet. The success of the Apollo 11 mission effectively ended the space race, demonstrating the capacity of humans to explore celestial bodies beyond Earth and setting the stage for further lunar missions and the eventual development of long-term space exploration plans. The first moon landing remains a shining symbol of human achievement and an enduring testimony to human ingenuity, determination, and collaborative spirit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: This article: Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance. Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became Top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. \\"Modern Love\\" and \\"China Girl\\" each made No. 2 in the UK, accompanied by a pair of \\"absorbing\\" promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said \\"activated key archetypes in the pop world.

(CNN) -- George Jones, the country music legend whose graceful, evocative voice gave depth to some of the greatest songs in country music -- including \\"She Thinks I Still Care,\\" \\"The Grand Tour\\" and \\"He Stopped Loving Her Today\\" -- has died, according to his public relations firm. Jones, 81, died Friday at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, the public relations firm said. He had been hospitalized since April 18 with fever and irregular blood pressure. Jones' career was marked by a tumultuous marriage to Tammy Wynette and bouts with alcoholism that led to occasional concert cancellations. (One of his nicknames was \\"No-Show Jones\\"; after he got clean, he puckishly used \\"No-Show\\" on his license plates.)","completion":"As the news of George Jones's passing spread, the country music world and its fans mourned the loss of a true legend. For his family, friends, and colleagues, it was a time of reflection and remembrance of the highs and lows of his extraordinary life and career. His passing signaled the end of an era, as George Jones had been one of the last living legends of country music's golden age. In the wake of his death, the public rediscovered his iconic songs, with many radio stations and streaming platforms paying tribute to his music. As fans revisited his extensive library of hits, the beauty and emotion in his lyrics were given a new, profound resonance. The music world would remember \\"No-Show Jones\\" not just for the trouble he faced throughout his life and career, but for his unwavering passion for music, which shone through even in the darkest times. Several major events and tributes were organized to honor George Jones's legacy. The Country Music Hall of Fame, where Jones had been inducted in 1992, set up a special exhibit dedicated to his life and work. The Grand Ole Opry, a venue that was intimately connected with his career, held a memorial service where fellow musicians and admirers shared stories, sang songs, and paid their respects to the man who had given so much to the country music scene. Posthumously, TV Specials and documentaries were created, detailing the life of George Jones, placing particular emphasis on his hard-fought battles with alcoholism and his tumultuous relationship with Tammy Wynette. These documentaries offered a more in-depth perspective of the man behind the voice, and helped solidify his position as an important figure in American music history. His autobiography, which he had been working on with music writer Tom Carter during his final years, would be published posthumously under the title, \\"The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend.\\" The book would go on to become a bestseller, allowing fans to relive George Jones's incredible journey from a poor, small-town boy to country music royalty. Meanwhile, songs that Jones had recorded, but never released, were collected into an album titled \\"Unreleased.\\" This album would be a bittersweet reminder of how much talent and passion George Jones still possessed in his later years, with the songs quickly becoming popular with fans. As a testament to his wide-reaching influence, contemporary country stars would continue to perform his music, revering his contribution to the genre. His songs would inspire the next generation of musicians, ensuring that his legacy endured for years to come. In conclusion, the story of George Jones, the country music legend, ends on a poignant note. With his passing, the world mourned the loss of one of the most iconic voices in the history of country music. Although his personal struggles ultimately played a part in defining his story, it's his commitment to his craft, and the beauty of his music that would be remembered by generations of fans. Through tributes, memorials, and the enduring power of his songs, George Jones's legacy was immortalized for future generations to admire and appreciate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Other than being repetitive, which makes it too long, the documentary is enjoyable in the sense of noticing some perversions fed by our unconscious, hence the commercial success of most thrillers studied and used as basis for this theory. I really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narration and the effort of Mr. Zizek to revive Freud's theory, which has been numb for too long, specially in north America. Again, it's way over the top and I believe not to be a completely waste of time for I do believe most humans have a dark appreciation for death and blood. What is the sentiment of this review?

However, with a few positive points like the interesting Freudian psychoanalysis, the energetic tone of the narration, and the effort to revive Freud's theory, it leans more towards a [B]. positive sentiment. The reviewer acknowledges that they enjoyed certain aspects of the film and learned something, but also criticized it for being repetitive and perversion-filled, making the experience a bit unbalanced."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She was thinking of including Liberty, Rupert and the kids in her public apology – but Kristen was so desperate to save her relationship with Rob she decided to concentrate on that first.” Pattinson and Stewart attend the UK premiere of 'The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1' in November 2011.

This could be perceived as a positive trait if referring to someone with deep knowledge of a specific subject or mastery over certain skills. On the other hand, it could also be seen negatively if it implies secretive or sneaky behavior. 2. \\"quietude\\": This term refers to a state of tranquility or peace.

Given the context, this could be considered either positive or negative. If it suggests a person's ability to tune into these subtle sounds and use them to their advantage, it would be positive. However, if it implies that the subject is only capable of producing inconsequential noise or lacks substance, it may be perceived as negative.

The like terms are -2966*g and 573*g. I will add these together: -2966*g + 573*g = (-2966 + 573)*g = -2393*g So, the simplified equation is: -2393*g + 195552 = 3039*g Step 2: Move all terms with g to one side of the equation. To do this, I will add 2393*g to both sides of the equation: -2393*g + 2393*g + 195552 = 3039*g + 2393*g This simplifies to: 195552 = 5432*g Step 3: Solve for g.

It was bad news for US President Donald Trump, who slipped 220 spots to 544 and must now rub along on just 3.5bn. Forbes said the 1bn fall in his wealth was due to the slow US property market. There were 183 tech billionaires on the Forbes list, with a combined 1tn in wealth. The list is dominated by US billionaires.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was number five and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison was number seven. The global population of billionaires, now put at a record 2,043, marks the biggest annual increase in the 31 years since the magazine began compiling the list. The number of US billionaires on the list was 565, which Forbes attributed to the recent stock market surge since Mr Trump's November 2016 election.

A nice change from the norm....although they do limit you to 1PP. This place is very small though. We came around 11pm on a Tuesday night, and we still had to wait 30min for a table. Be prepared to wait, no matter what time you show up. This wasn't a big deal for me, since I never mind waiting for something \\"worth\\" waiting for... And they also seem to skimp out on the desserts. They have it clearly written, one dessert per person....this isn't a big deal for me personally, but a lot of my friends go crazy with the AYCE mochi and tempura icecream found in other places. Last thing, order the tempura icecream for dessert! Yes, you will have to pay an additional 4-5 since it is not included....but it is worth it! Not only is the portion size huge, but they make it out of strawberry icecream so it is super sweet, and very good.

As a former Ohio substitute teacher at Columbus' East High School has learned, not doing so could land you in jail. Yesterday, a judge sentenced long-term temp Sheila Kearns to three years of probation, plus 90 days in jail as a condition, after Kearns showed the unrated movie The ABCs of Death to five classes of students when she was asked to fill in for a Spanish teacher in April 2013, the Columbus Dispatch reports. She was fired two months later. Kearns, 58, who doesn't speak Spanish, said she didn't watch the movie beforehand and had her back to the TV all day. What she reportedly missed: grisly deaths, full-frontal nudity, and graphic sex in movie chapters titled \\"E is for Exterminate\\" and \\"O is for Orgasm,\\" reports the AP. Kearns, who apologized in court, was convicted of four counts of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles (the students were 14 to 18) in January. A jury cleared her of one count, believing Kearns didn't know the movie's content during the first showing. But a student testified that Kearns did watch the movie, and the jury appeared to side with Judge Charles A. Schneider, who said Kearns' claim that she didn't watch it was \\"unconscionable. There's no way you'll persuade me that's what happened.\\" He also slammed Columbus public schools. \\"This is what happens when you put a teacher in a class that she cannot teach,\\" he said. Schneider ordered Kearns to report to jail on April 10, but the sentence will be delayed as Kearns' lawyer appeals her conviction. (Another substitute teacher was fired for asking kids about her love life.) Article:","completion":"Title: The Consequences of a Classroom Film Unwatched: Ohio Substitute Teacher Faces Jail Time In the rich tapestry of teaching, a key tip for teachers has come to the fore following a critical incident in Columbus' East High School in Ohio. The critical piece of advice - always screen a film before you show it to your students. A lesson most unfortunately learned by Sheila Kearns, a substitute teacher, who was sentenced to three years of probation and 90 days in jail for failing to abide by it. Residing in a school culture that not only treasures education but also the well-being of students, the episode serves as a stark reminder of the significant responsibility placed upon educators. What a teacher decides to bring into the classroom environment affects the learning trajectory of students, as Kearns discovered to her dismay. She was asked to fill-in for a Spanish teacher in April 2013, an incident that ended up having dire consequences both for her and the five classes of students exposed to the unrated movie, 'The ABCs of Death.' Two months after the incident, Kearns' teaching journey took a turn for the worse. She was fired after the school discovered the nature of the movie shown to students aged 14 to 18 years old. The graphic movie encompassed a myriad of hard-hitting scenes involving grisly deaths, full-frontal nudity, and positions of sexual intimacy. It was a stark contrast from what would normally be expected in a classroom setting. The class viewing ended up more aligned with chapters titled \\"E is for Exterminate\\" and \\"O is for Orgasm,\\" rather than a day of learning Spanish. Kearns, who was also handed a conviction of four counts of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles, did express remorse over her actions. However, as a key argument in her defense, Kearns claimed that she was not aware of the movie content, explaining she hadn't watched the material beforehand and had her back to the screen throughout the day. However, her claims were met with skepticism. A student contradicted Kearns' assertion, testifying that the substitute teacher had indeed watched the movie. This testimony seemingly tipped the scales in favor of Judge Charles A. Schneider's derogatory conclusion. Refuting Kearns' claim, Judge Schneider mentioned, \\"There's no way you'll persuade me that's what happened.\\" He also highlighted the imprudence of the Columbus public schools, criticizing the decision to assign a teacher to a class she wasn't equipped to teach. This incident has led to Kearns staring down the barrel of her sentence. However, the start of her sentence, scheduled for April 10, will be delayed due to an appeal launched by Kearns' attorney against her conviction. The incident not only raises a red-flag on Kearns' actions but also points rankled fingers at the flaws prevalent in the education system. While it underlines the critical requirement for educators to fully comprehend and vet the content they bring in their classrooms, it also amplifies the fact that the task of placing a teacher in a role should be done judiciously by the schools. As the story of Kearns unravels, it stands as a grim reminder of the power wielded by educators, and the severe consequences that can unfold when not used judiciously. It underscores a fundamental lesson - watching and understanding a movie's content before showing it in class is not merely a precaution, but a necessity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456. Question: \\"Why was Melaka not an ideal place for most people to live in its early days?\\" Answer: \\"It was full of pirates\\" Is this answer correct?

Hypothesis: Both dogs are black and brown. Now let us analyze the hypothesis: 1. It states that there are two dogs involved in the situation. 2. The dogs have a combination of black and brown colors (i.e., each dog has both black and brown fur). For the hypothesis to hold true, there must be evidence in the premise supporting each aspect of the hypothesis. Let's compare the information from the premise with the hypothesis. 1. The presence of a black dog can be confirmed through the premise. 2. The premise also mentions another dog, but it doesn't provide details about the color of this second dog, only stating that it is being playfully bitten by the black dog. 3. The setting of the living room is not essential in determining the truth value of the hypothesis, as it is unrelated to the colors of the dogs involved. Given the information in the premise, we cannot confirm whether the second dog is black and brown or any other possible color combination. As such, it is not possible to conclusively state that the hypothesis is true based solely on the truth of the premise. There is insufficient information available.

First, he must divorce his vulgar and promiscuous wife Miriam (Laura Elliott). On a train, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) recognizes Guy and knows about his marital situation from the gossip pages. Bruno introduces himself, then proposes an idea for the perfect homicide: he and Guy should \\"swap murders\\". Bruno will murder Miriam, and in exchange Guy will kill Bruno's despised father. Each would be killing a stranger. Having no identifiable motive for the crimes, neither would be suspects. Guy humors Bruno's absurd murder plot by pretending to find it amusing. Bruno interprets this as agreement to the scheme. Bruno then borrows Guy's monogrammed cigarette lighter and slips it into his own pocket. Guy meets with Miriam. Pregnant by someone else, she now refuses to give Guy a divorce and threatens to cause a scandal. Guy relays the bad news to Anne, metaphorically commenting that he would like to \\"strangle\\" Miriam. Meanwhile, Bruno stalks Miriam through an amusement park and fatally strangles her on the \\"Magic Isle\\". Bruno then informs Guy that Miriam is dead, and expects him to follow through on murdering Bruno's father. Bruno sends Guy his house key, a map to his father's bedroom, and a pistol. When the police question Guy about Miriam's death, he claims he was on a train at the time of the murder. The police determine his alibi is inconclusive because he could have left the train in time to commit the murder and continued his trip on another train. Guy is not arrested, but the police assign an officer to trail him to ensure he does not flee while they investigate.

During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived.

Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"A dog jogs through the grass.\\", is the sentence \\"a dog runs through grass\\" a true sentence? Available choices: [I] yes. [II] it is not possible to tell. [III] no.","completion":"[I] yes. The sentence \\"A dog jogs through the grass.\\" describes a scenario in which a dog is moving through grass at a jogging pace. The word \\"jog\\" generally means to run at a steady or gentle pace. Thus, it implies that the dog is running but not as fast as it would sprint. Meanwhile, the alternative sentence, \\"A dog runs through grass,\\" is a simplified version of the original, utilizing the broader term \\"runs\\" instead of the more specific \\"jogs.\\" However, it is essential to note that the word \\"runs\\" encompasses various speeds - from gentle jogging to more rapid sprinting. Therefore, the second sentence remains truthful to the original, as it refers to a dog moving, running, or proceeding in the grass, which indeed could include jogging. It is important also to consider that the alternative sentence has omitted the word \\"the\\" before \\"grass.\\" Despite this omission, the meaning still stands that a dog is running through some grass. In conclusion, given the contexts of both sentences that describe a dog in motion through grass, the sentence \\"a dog runs through grass\\" can be considered a true sentence based on the initial sentence, \\"A dog jogs through the grass.\\" As a result, the correct choice is [I] yes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Handling emergencies was never very difficult for Kevin but it was for Nelson because Pick from: (a). Kevin could remain calm under pressure. (b). Nelson could remain calm under pressure.","completion":"(a). Kevin could remain calm under pressure. Handling emergencies was never very difficult for Kevin but it was for Nelson because Kevin could remain calm under pressure. This ability had always come naturally to Kevin, and it earned him the admiration of his friends and colleagues. Nelson, on the other hand, was known to be prone to anxiety in high-pressure situations. Despite his competence and expertise in many fields, his tendency to get flustered in emergencies often held him back. Kevin and Nelson lived in a small rural town in the Midwest, where they worked together at the local fire department. The town had a history of mysterious fires, and it was up to them to keep their community safe from these blazes. Their contrasting abilities to handle emergencies had led them down different paths in their careers—Kevin served as the lead firefighter, while Nelson coordinated dispatch and communication efforts. One day, a fire raged through a local chemical plant, and there was a risk of hazardous substances getting released into the air, threatening the safety of the town. Kevin, as the leader of the firefighting team, was tasked with extinguishing the blaze before it could spread any further. It was a dangerous mission, with numerous lives at stake, and the penalty for failure could be devastating. Meanwhile, Nelson was in the command center, monitoring the situation and coordinating the response efforts. Despite his anxiety, he knew he had an essential role to play in this high-stakes situation. He was responsible for tracking the fire's progress, alerting nearby residents, and keeping his team informed of any potential dangers. As the firefighters arrived at the scene, Kevin's natural ability to remain calm under pressure proved crucial in the face of such a challenging emergency. He quickly assessed the situation, directed his team, and established a safe perimeter before beginning a resolute attack on the flames. His clear-headed decisiveness and leadership were key factors in navigating the dangers they faced. Back at the command center, Nelson tried his best to maintain control over his anxiety, knowing that his abilities could be instrumental in saving lives. It was hard for him to concentrate, but he focused all his energy on his tasks, ensuring that firefighters were well informed about the dangers they faced and directing them as necessary. As the flames roared through the chemical plant, the teams faced numerous challenges - toxic smoke filling the air; chemicals reacting with the intense heat; and exploding containers, which sent debris flying across the area. But, through it all, the dedicated team of Kevin and Nelson remained resolute in their goals of extinguishing the blaze and keeping their town safe. They recognized that they both played vital but different roles in the outcome of this emergency. Gradually, the fire was brought under control, and the danger to the town was averted. The residents breathed a collective sigh of relief and were grateful for the bravery and skill their local firefighting heroes had displayed. Nelson, despite his challenges, had been able to push through his anxiety and contribute to the team's hard-fought victory. In the end, this emergency had shown Kevin and Nelson the true value of teamwork – recognizing and utilizing each other's strengths while supporting one another through their weaknesses. Kevin's calm demeanor in the face of crisis complemented Nelson's expertise in coordination and communication. This emergency had not only deepened their mutual respect but also strengthened their bond as friends and colleagues."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When Kristen, believing Freddy is coming back, summons Joey and Kincaid into her dreams, she angers them and they warn her that dreaming of Freddy might actually cause his return. The next day, Kristen picks up her boyfriend, martial arts enthusiast Rick Johnson, and his sister and Kristen's best friend, Alice. Going to school she meets with her other friends: Sheila, a genius and asthmatic; and Debbie, a tough girl who doesn't like bugs. Alice daydreams that her crush Dan Jordan recognizes her, but she snaps out of it when Rick teasingly offers to introduce them. That night, Kristen stays awake to keep from dreaming, but Kincaid falls asleep and awakens in a junkyard where his dog Jason innocently resurrects Freddy from his grave. Trapped, Kincaid tries to fight off Freddy with his strength, but Freddy rebounds and kills him. He tricks Joey into thinking a model is swimming in his waterbed, but Freddy attacks him, drowning out his dream power and stabbing him for his mother to find the next morning.

Article: When you meet someone for the first time, do you put across a good impression? And what do we mean by \\"good\\" in the context? According to Presence, a new book by Harvard Business School professor Amy Cuddy, people assess you on two main criteria when they first meet you: 1. Can I trust this person? 2. Can I respect this person? Your level of trustworthiness, or warmth, is the most important factor in how people initially admire you, Cuddy says-yet many mistakenly believe that the second factor,characterised as competence, is more important.\\"From an evolutionary aspect,\\"Cuddy writes,\\"it is more important to our survival to know whether a person deserves our trust.\\" While displaying competence is certainly beneficial, particularly in a work setting, Cuddy warns that focusing on winning people's respect, while failing to win their trust, can backfire-a common problem for young professionals attempting to make a good impression early on in their careers. \\"If someone you're trying to influence doesn't trust you, you're not going to get very far\\", Cuddy says, \\"A warm, trustworthy person who is also strong elicits admiration, but only after you've established trust does your strength become a gift rather than a threat.\\" In Cuddy's book she also explains some of the science that can help you spot a liar. When a person is lying there is likely to be differences between what they are saying and what they are doing, she suggests. \\"Lying is hard work,\\" she writes, \\"We're telling one story while suppressing another, and most of us are experiencing psychological guilt about doing this, which we're also trying suppress. We just don't have the brainpower to manage it all without letting something go-without'leaking'.\\" \\"It's about how well or poorly our multiple channels of communications-facial expressions, posture, movement, vocal qualities, speech-co-operate,\\"she adds. \\"When we're consciously looking for signs of cheat or truth, we pay too much attention to words and not enough to the external body language,\\" the...
