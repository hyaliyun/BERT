Let's proceed with a step-by-step breakdown of the solution. 1. **Analyzing the equation with specific values of y:** Considering the equation with y=0 and y=1: [ f(x) = sum_{k=0}^{n} c_{k} x^{k} + x^{n} h(x), quad x neq 0 f(x) = sum_{k=0}^{n} d_{k} x^{k} + (x-1)^{n} h(x), quad x neq 1 ] 2. **Determine ( h(x) ) using the above forms of ( f(x) ):** [ h(x) = frac{sum_{k=0}^{n} left(d_{k} - c_{k}right) x^{k}}{x^{n} - (x-1)^{n}} ] This equation is valid for ( x neq 0, 1 ). In the case of even ( n ), we must also exclude ( x = frac{1}{2} ). 3. **Fix ( y = 2 ) and ( y = 4 ) and find a similar expression:** [ h(x) = frac{sum_{k=0}^{n} left(f_{k} - e_{k}right) x^{k}}{(x-2)^{n} - (x-4)^{n}} ] This equality holds for ( x neq 2, 3, 4 ). 4. **Infinite differentiability of ( h ):** Combining these results, we obtain that the function ( h ) is infinitely differentiable. Therefore, from two given forms of ( f ): [ f^{(n)}(x) = n! g_{n}(y) + frac{d^{n}}{dx^{n}}left((x-y)^{n} h(x)right) ] 5. **Determine that ( g_n(y) ) is a polynomial:** By fixing ( x ), it follows that ( g_n(y) ) must be a polynomial. By differentiating the equation (1) ( n-1 ) times, it can be analogously shown that ( g_{n-1}(y) ) is also a polynomial, and so forth. 6. **Differentiating with respect to ( y ) and setting ( y = 0 ):** Differentiating equation (1) with respect to ( y ) and setting ( y = 0 ): [ 0 = - sum_{k=0}^{n} k x^{k-1} g_{k}(0) + sum_{k=0}^{n} k x^{k} g_{k}^{prime}(0) - n x^{n-1} h(x) ] From this, it follows that ( x^{n-1} h(x) ) is a polynomial degree not higher than ( n ). 7. **Differentiating n times with respect to ( y ) and setting ( y = 0 ) to show ( h(x) ) is a polynomial:** By differentiating ( n ) times with respect to ( y ) and evaluating at ( y = 0 ), we show that ( h(x) ) is indeed a polynomial of degree not higher than ( n ). Hence, if ( x^{n-1} h(x) ) is a polynomial of degree not higher than ( n ), then ( h(x) ): [ h(x) = a x + b ] 8. **Conclusively, if ( f(x) ) is infinitely differentiable:** Since ( f(x) ) is infinitely differentiable, and considering the relationship between ( g_k(y) ), ( g_n(y) ), and ( h(x) ), we can conclude that ( f(x) ) is a polynomial of degree no higher than ( n+1 ). 9. **Therefore, we can write the final form of ( f(x + y) ):** [ f(x + y) = sum_{k=0}^{n+1} frac{f^{(k)}(y)}{k!} x^{k} ] 10. **Express ( f(x + y) ) as a polynomial:** Substituting specific ( g_k(y) ) and ( g_n(y) ): [ g_{k}(y) = frac{f^{(k)}(y)}{k!} quad text{for} quad k = 0, 1, ldots, n-1 g_{n}(y) = frac{f^{(n)}(y)}{n!} - a y - b frac{f^{(n+1)}(y)}{(n+1)!} = a ] Thus the functions can be determined in the required form.

Thus, Y^* is the second intersection of line AB^* with ell_Q^*. - Z^* is the intersection of ell_P^* with ell_Q^*. 4. **Define Distances and Angles:** - Let a = B^*P^*, b = B^*Q^*, and x = B^*A = B^*M^*. - B^*X^* = frac{a^2}{x} and B^*Y^* = frac{b^2}{x}. - Define R such that B^* lies between Q^* and R on line Omega^* and B^*R = frac{ab}{x}. 5. **Show Concyclicity:** - We need to show that R, X^*, Y^*, Z^* are concyclic. - We need to show that measuredangle X^*RY^* = measuredangle X^*Z^*Y^*. 6. **Calculate Angles:** - measuredangle X^*RY^* = measuredangle X^*RB^* + measuredangle B^*RY^* = measuredangle X^*RB^* + measuredangle RX^*B^*. - Define S as the second intersection of Gamma with Omega^*. B^*S = frac{ax}{b}, so A, X^*, R, S are concyclic. - measuredangle X^*RB^* + measuredangle RX^*B^* = measuredangle B^*AS + measuredangle B^*SA = theta + measuredangle M^*AS + measuredangle Q^*SA. - Thus, measuredangle X^*RY^* = theta + measuredangle M^*AS + measuredangle Q^*SA. 7. **Compare with measuredangle X^*Z^*Y^*:** - measuredangle X^*Z^*Y^* = measuredangle X^*Z^*A + measuredangle AZ^*Y^* = measuredangle X^*P^*A + measuredangle AQ^*Y^*. - measuredangle X^*P^*A = measuredangle X^*P^*B^* + measuredangle B^*P^*A = measuredangle B^*AP^* + measuredangle B^*P^*A. - Similarly, measuredangle AQ^*Y^* = measuredangle AQ^*B^* + measuredangle B^*Q^*Y^* = measuredangle AQ^*B^* + measuredangle Q^*AB^*. - Thus, measuredangle X^*Z^*Y^* = (measuredangle B^*AP^* + measuredangle B^*P^*A) + (measuredangle AQ^*B^* + measuredangle Q^*AB^*) = measuredangle B^*P^*A + measuredangle AQ^*B^* + measuredangle Q^*AP^* = measuredangle M^*P^*A + measuredangle AQ^*S + measuredangle Q^*M^*P^*. - = measuredangle M^*Q^*A + measuredangle AQ^*S + measuredangle Q^*M^*A + measuredangle AM^*P^*. - = measuredangle M^*Q^*S + measuredangle Q^*M^*A + theta. - = measuredangle M^*AS^* + measuredangle Q^*M^*A + theta. 8. **Conclusion:** - We conclude that measuredangle X^*RY^* = measuredangle X^*Z^*Y^*, as desired. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Let B be the product of the divisors of 60.

Specifically, let the sides opposite to vertices A, B, and \`C\` be denoted by a, b, and \`c\` respectively. The heights corresponding to these sides will be denoted as m_a, m_b, and m_c respectively. 2. **Given Conditions**: According to the problem, two heights of the triangle are at least as large as the sides they are perpendicular to. Let's denote these heights as m_a and m_b, corresponding to sides a and b respectively. We thus have: m_a geq a, quad m_b geq b 3. **Interpreting the Heights**: Additionally, we know from properties of heights in triangles that m_a and m_b are perpendicular segments from vertices A and \`B\` to sides a and \`b\`, respectively. This means: m_a leq b, quad m_b leq a This is because m_a is a leg of a right triangle where b forms the hypotenuse, and analogously for m_b with side \`a\`. 4. **Combining Given Conditions and Height Relationships**: Using the inequalities from steps 2 and 3, we derive: a leq m_a leq b quad text{and} quad b leq m_b leq a 5. **Simplifying Inequalities**: From the above, we can restate: a leq b leq a These relationships imply that: a = b Consequently, we also must have: m_a = a quad text{and} quad m_b = b since both m_a and m_b fall within the range defined by a and b, and a = b. 6. **Concluding the Triangle Properties**: Given that a = b and m_a = a, m_b = b, it implies that the triangle is an isosceles triangle with the legs being equal.

A point ( T ) is placed inside ( triangle ABC ) such that ( angle ATB = angle BTC = angle ATC = 120^circ ). The median of ( triangle ABC ) intersect at ( M ), the centroid. The line ( TM ) intersects the circumcircle of ( triangle ATC ) at point ( K ). 2. **Identify the Circumcenter**: Let ( O ) be the circumcenter of ( triangle ABC ). Since ( angle AOC = 2 angle ABC = 120^circ ), point ( O ) lies on the circumcircle ( gamma ) of ( triangle ATC ). 3. **Consider Reflections and Symmetries**: Let line ( BT ) intersect the circumcircle ( gamma ) again at point ( X ) and the circumcircle ( Omega ) of triangle ( ABC ) at point ( P ). Given that ( angle ATX = angle CTX = 60^circ ), point ( X ) lies on the perpendicular bisector of ( AC ). Therefore, ( OX ) is a diameter of ( gamma ), meaning ( BT perp OT ) indicating that ( T ) is the midpoint of the chord ( BP ) on ( Omega ). 4. **Relate Medians and Chords**: Now consider point ( K' ) symmetric to point ( P ) with respect to the midpoint ( S ) of side ( AC ). Given ( angle AK'C = angle APC = 120^circ ), point ( K' ) must lie on ( gamma ). Thus, ( M ) is the centroid of ( triangle BPK' ) and divides the segments in the ratio ( 2:1 ) from vertex ( B ). Consequently, ( M ) lies on ( KT ) with ( KM:MT = 2:1 ). 5. **Analyze Proportions in Trapezoid**: The triangle configuration ensures ( M ) on ( KT ) correctly divides the segment ( KT ) such that ( MK = 2 TM ).

Thus, each term of the summation contains a unique (non-empty) combination of ( x_i ) terms, raised to the ( n )th power. 4. **Define function ( f(i) )**: Define ( f(i) ) as the number of ( x_i ) terms in ( T_i ). That is: [ f(i) = sum_{j=1}^n b_{i,j} ] 5. **Define set ( S(m) )**: Let ( S(m) ) be the set of terms ( T_i ) such that ( f(i) = m ). The number of terms in ( S(m) ) is ( binom{n}{m} ), where ( 1 le m le n ). 6. **Consider the full expansion of ( S(n) )**: Begin with the one element in ( S(n) ). Consider the full expansion of this element. Fully expanded, there is one term of the form ( n! cdot x_1 cdot x_2 cdot x_3 cdots x_n ). This is the one and only term containing the expression on the left-hand side of our problem statement. We can see that ( c_i ) for this term is ( frac{1}{n!} ). Every remaining term in the full expansion of this element is also an ( n )th-order term. 7. **Categorize terms by partitions of ( n )**: Every expansion of every ( T_i ) results in a set of ( n )th-order terms. These terms can be categorized by grouping them into partitions of ( n ). For example, if ( n = 5 ), the partitions of ( n ) are ( 5, 4+1, 3+2, 2+2+1, 2+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1 ). Partitions of the form \\"5\\" are: ( s^5, t^5, u^5, v^5, w^5 ). Partitions of the form \\"4+1\\" are: ( s^4 t, s^4 u, s^4 v, ldots, w^4 v ). [There are 20 distinct terms sharing this partition.] Note that ( s, t, u, v, w ) represent ( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5 ). 8. **Coefficients for partitions**: It is not important to know the value of the coefficients for any given partition of ( n ). However, it is important that the coefficients for a given partition of ( n ) are always the same (and always an integer), for every expansion of ( T_i ). 9. **Consider expansions of ( S(n-1) )**: Next, consider the full expansions of the ( n ) elements in ( S(n-1) ). We will choose the same value of ( c_i ) for all of these terms. We will find a single value of ( c_i ) is sufficient to cancel all of the terms containing exactly ( n-1 ) distinct values of ( x_j ), from the previous expansion. The elements of ( S(n-1) ) will not introduce any new terms we have previously resolved. The value we choose for ( c_i ) is rational because the operations we use to choose its value are sums, differences, products, and quotients of integers and rational numbers. 10. **Continue with ( S(n-2) )**: Next, consider the full expansions of the ( binom{n}{2} ) elements in ( S(n-2) ). We will choose the same value of ( c_i ) for all of these terms. Again, we will find a single value of ( c_i ) is sufficient to cancel all of the terms containing exactly ( n-2 ) distinct values of ( x_j ), from the previous expansions. The elements of ( S(n-2) ) will not introduce any new terms we have previously resolved. 11. **Continue until ( S(1) )**: We continue in this manner, considering the full expansions of the elements in ( S(n-3) ), then ( S(n-4) ), and so on to ( S(1) ). After applying the above technique to the elements in ( S(1) ), all terms will have been eliminated, except the term of the form ( x_1 cdot x_2 cdot x_3 cdots x_n ). 12. **Example for ( n = 3 )**: [ T_7 = (1x_1 + 1x_2 + 1x_3)^3 ] [ T_6 = (1x_1 + 1x_2 + 0x_3)^3 ] [ T_5 = (1x_1 + 0x_2 + 1x_3)^3 ] [ T_4 = (1x_1 + 0x_2 + 0x_3)^3 ] [ T_3 = (0x_1 + 1x_2 + 1x_3)^3 ] [ T_2 = (0x_1 + 1x_2 + 0x_3)^3 ] [ T_1 = (0x_1 + 0x_2 + 1x_3)^3 ] [ c_7 = frac{1}{6} quad text{(3-distinct x-terms)} ] [ c_3 = c_5 = c_6 = -frac{1}{6} quad text{(2-distinct x-terms)} ] [ c_1 = c_2 = c_4 = frac{1}{6} quad text{(1-distinct x-terms)} ] Thus, we have shown that for any positive integer ( n ), there exists an integer ( N ) such that the product ( x_1 x_2 cdots x_n ) can be expressed in the desired form.

Therefore, by successively applying the operation to pairs of numbers, the greatest possible remaining value will always be less than or equal to the second largest number initially on the board. 4. **Special Case - Largest Pair**: When 2017 is paired with smaller numbers, say 2: [ begin{aligned} x &= sqrt{2017^2 - 2 cdot 2017 + 2^2} &= sqrt{2017^2 - 4034 + 4} &= sqrt{2017^2 - 4030} &= sqrt{(2017 - 2)(2017 + 2)} &= sqrt{2015 cdot 2019} &> sqrt{2011^2} &= 2011 end{aligned} ] Since (x approx 2011), we observe here the highest possible remaining value could be bounded by and actually is 2011. Therefore, by these steps, we conclude that the maximum value that can remain on the board after several operations is: [ boxed{2011} ]"},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, the lengths of the sides opposite to angles A, B, C are a, b, c respectively, and a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}+bc, a= sqrt {3}, S is the area of triangle ABC.

Consider a circle of radius 1, covered by seven identical circles. We will prove that the radii of these seven circles are no smaller than frac{1}{2}. 2. Assume the contrary, that each smaller circle has a radius less than frac{1}{2}. We will refer to these circles as \\"small circles\\". 3. Imagine these small circles are positioned so that they cover the boundary of the larger circle. We need to show that there are at least seven such circles. 4. Recall that any chord of length 1 in a circle of radius 1 corresponds to an arc of 60^circ because such a chord is a side of a regular hexagon inscribed in the circle. 5. Now, each of these small circles, since their radius is less than frac{1}{2}, cut out arcs of the larger circle whose corresponding chords must be less than 1. Consequently, the arc subtended by each small circle is less than 60^circ. 6. Since the total measure of the circumference of the larger circle is 360^circ, and each small circle covers less than 60^circ, it is clear that at least six small circles (each contributing an arc smaller than 60^circ) cannot fully cover the boundary of the larger circle. 7. Thus, an additional small circle is required to cover the remaining arc, proving that we need at least seven small circles to cover the boundary of the larger circle. 8. Additionally, one of these circles must be at the center to cover the remaining central area, thus requiring the use of at least eight circles. 9. Since covering the circle with seven smaller circles, each covering less than 60^circ on average, cannot cover the boundary and the center, the assumption that the smaller circles have a radius less than frac{1}{2} leads to a contradiction. Conclusion: Therefore, the radii of the seven covering circles must be at least frac{1}{2}. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given that the vertex of angle alpha is at the origin, its initial side coincides with the positive halfaxis of the xaxis, and its terminal side passes through point Pleft(frac{3}{5}, frac{4}{5}right).

Substituting the given magnitudes and the relationship derived from the angle into the equation, we get 7 = 1^2 - 2cdot1cdot|overrightarrow{b}|cdotfrac{1}{2} + |overrightarrow{b}|^2. 5. This equation simplifies to 7 = 1 - |overrightarrow{b}| + |overrightarrow{b}|^2. Rearranging it yields |overrightarrow{b}|^2 - |overrightarrow{b}| - 6 = 0. 6. Solving this quadratic equation for |overrightarrow{b}|, we recognize it as a standard form quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -1, and c = -6. 7. Factoring or using the quadratic formula, we find that |overrightarrow{b}| has two possible values, but since |overrightarrow{b}| represents a magnitude and therefore must be positive, we select the positive value from the solutions. 8. The solution to the equation |overrightarrow{b}|^2 - |overrightarrow{b}| - 6 = 0 that is positive is |overrightarrow{b}| = 3. Therefore, the magnitude of vector overrightarrow{b}, denoted as |overrightarrow{b}|, is boxed{3}."},{"prompt":"Cindy wishes to arrange her coins into X piles, each consisting of the same number of coins, Y.

Since there are 17 possible values for Y, there are 17 + 2 = 19 factors of n. We need to find the smallest n with exactly 19 factors. To determine the total number of factors of n, we use the prime factorization of n. The number of factors is the product of (each exponent + 1) in the prime factorization. We need to find the smallest set of exponents that multiply to 19. The factorizations that could yield 19 factors are: - {18}: This corresponds to p^{18}, where p is a prime number. The smallest number is 2^{18}. - {18, 1}: This corresponds to p^{18} cdot q, with distinct primes p and q. The smallest number is 2^{18} cdot 3 = 786432. - Because 19 is a prime number, it can only be presented as the product of itself and 1 (19 = 19 * 1).

The goal is to find the derivative of g(x), which will help us understand its behavior and ultimately lead to the inequality we need to prove. 1. **Finding the derivative of g(x):** We apply the quotient rule for derivatives, which states that if h(x) = frac{u(x)}{v(x)}, then h'(x) = frac{u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)}{(v(x))^2}. For g(x)=frac{{f(x)}}{{e^{3x}}}, u(x) = f(x) and v(x) = e^{3x}, so u'(x) = f'(x) and v'(x) = 3e^{3x}. [ g'(x) = frac{{f'(x)e^{3x} - 3f(x)e^{3x}}}{{(e^{3x})^2}} = frac{{f'(x) - 3f(x)}}{{e^{3x}}} ] 2. **Analyzing the sign of g'(x):** Given that 3f(x) - f'(x) > 0 for all x in R, we can rearrange this inequality to f'(x) - 3f(x) < 0. Substituting this into our expression for g'(x), we find that g'(x) < 0 for all x in R. This implies that g(x) is monotonically decreasing over its domain, meaning that if x_1 < x_2, then g(x_1) > g(x_2). 3. **Applying the monotonicity of g(x):** Since g(x) is monotonically decreasing, we know that for 0 < 1, g(0) > g(1). Substituting the definition of g(x) into this inequality gives: [ frac{{f(0)}}{{e^0}} > frac{{f(1)}}{{e^3}} ] Simplifying the inequality, we find: [ f(1) < e^3 f(0) ] 4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the correct answer to the question of which inequality must be true is: [ boxed{text{A: } f(1) < e^{3}f(0)} ]"},{"prompt":"Nancy, Melanie, Mary, and Alyssa each bought 540 baseball cards, which come in packs of a certain number.

Explain.","completion":"Part (a) Answer: Let's consider several factors that may explain why joint purchases are beneficial despite the associated risks: 1. **Cost Savings:** - **Economies of Scale:** Joint purchases allow for significant cost savings on goods because they are effectively purchased at wholesale prices. - **Reduced Overhead Costs:** The overhead costs related to the delivery of goods to the buyer and payment for the organizers' services are relatively insignificant. This is because these costs are distributed among all participants in the group. 2. **Improved Quality Assessment:** - **Shared Information:** A large group of consumers working together and sharing information about previously purchased products can more accurately assess the quality of goods compared to individual buyers. - **Better Choices:** This collective experience helps them choose better options and exchange goods among themselves if necessary. 3. **Community and Trust:** - **Shared Objectives:** Within such communities, people are generally more willing to share objective information about products, organizers, and suppliers. - **Higher Willingness to Pay:** Therefore, even if joint purchases involve costs due to the described risks, buyers are willing to pay for purchases from those whose reputation is higher, indicating the quality of the goods. # Conclusion for Part (a): The practice of joint purchases remains popular because it allows participants to save on costs, make better-informed decisions, and trust the purchase process within a community of like-minded individuals. Part (b) Answer: Let's consider several factors that may explain the unpopularity of joint household purchases among neighbors despite the potential savings on delivery costs: 1. **High Transaction Costs:** - **Time and Effort:** Even if neighbors can agree on the timing of such purchases, significant transaction costs may arise. This includes the effort required to coordinate and manage the purchases. - **Variety of Products:** The assortment of products each neighbor needs can be highly diverse. While forming a single order might not be very difficult, sorting the goods after purchase and ensuring each buyer gets their specific order can demand substantial time and effort. 2. **Organizational Efforts:** - **Finding a Volunteer:** Finding someone willing to carry out these substantial organizational tasks, even for a reward, might be challenging. - **Cost of Compensation:** The amount of compensation required for these efforts could constitute a substantial part of each participant's expenses, leading neighbors to deem participation in joint purchases unbeneficial. 3. **Convenience and Proximity:** - **Frequent Unplanned Purchases:** Often, stores are located near residences, and purchases are made spontaneously or \\"on the go\\". This minimizes the perceived necessity for coordinated purchases. 4. **Disputes and Fairness:** - **Distribution of Costs:** Potential conflicts may arise among neighbors over how to fairly divide the delivery costs. The assortment of goods in terms of weight and value can vary greatly among neighbors. - **Agreement on Method:** Reaching a consensus on a fair way to allocate these costs can be difficult. # Conclusion for Part (b): Joint purchases are less popular among neighbors for everyday products due to the high organizational costs, difficulty in coordination, and potential disputes, making self-managed and spontaneous purchases more convenient. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A teacher grades students' tests by using a certain ratio to subtract the number of incorrect responses from the number of correct responses.

Along with the domain from step 1, we split the real line into intervals to solve the inequality: - If (a < -5), the term ((x - a)) is always positive within the given domain (x geq -5).

The total number of people in the ferris wheel and the bumper cars lines after these changes is given as Z. Therefore, we can express Z as: Z = (50 - x) + (50 + y) Now, after an hour, the roller coaster line doubles in number, so there are now 2 * 50 = 100 people in the roller coaster line. To determine the total number of people across all lines after an hour, we need to add the number of people in each line: Total number of people = (Number of people in ferris wheel line) + (Number of people in bumper cars line) + (Number of people in roller coaster line) Since the ferris wheel and bumper cars lines together have Z people after the first half an hour, and there are no further changes mentioned for these lines in the second half an hour, we can assume that Z also represents the total number of people in these two lines after an hour.

We need to find the limit of (M_n) as (n) approaches infinity, where (M_n) is the smallest possible value of ((AP^n + BP^n + CP^n)^{frac{1}{n}}) over all points (P) in the plane. 2. **Using the Erdős–Mordell Inequality:** The Erdős–Mordell inequality states that for any point (P) inside a triangle (ABC), the sum of the distances from (P) to the sides of the triangle is less than or equal to half the perimeter of the triangle. However, this inequality does not directly help us with the given problem. 3. **Considering the Limit as (n to infty):** As (n) approaches infinity, the expression ((AP^n + BP^n + CP^n)^{frac{1}{n}}) is dominated by the largest of the distances (AP), (BP), and (CP). Therefore, we need to minimize the maximum distance from (P) to the vertices (A), (B), and (C). 4. **Finding the Fermat Point:** The point (P) that minimizes the sum of distances to the vertices of a triangle is known as the Fermat point (or Torricelli point). For a triangle with all angles less than (120^circ), the Fermat point is the point such that the total distance from (P) to the vertices is minimized. 5. **Calculating the Circumradius:** The circumradius (R) of a triangle with sides (a), (b), and (c) can be calculated using the formula: [ R = frac{abc}{4K} ] where (K) is the area of the triangle.

Therefore, we have the equation: 40A + 60O = 720 We also know that A + O = 15, so we can express O in terms of A: O = 15 - A Substituting this into the first equation, we get: 40A + 60(15 - A) = 720 40A + 900 - 60A = 720 -20A = 720 - 900 -20A = -180 A = 9 So Mary selects 9 apples. Since A + O = 15, we have: 9 + O = 15 O = 15 - 9 O = 6 Mary selects 6 oranges. Now, we want to find out how many oranges Mary must put back so that the average price of the pieces of fruit she keeps is 45 cents. Let's denote the number of oranges she puts back as x. The new total number of pieces of fruit will be 15 - x, and the new total cost will be 720 - 60x (since each orange costs 60 cents). The new average cost will be (720 - 60x) / (15 - x) = 45 cents. So we have the equation: (720 - 60x) / (15 - x) = 45 Multiplying both sides by (15 - x) to clear the fraction, we get: 720 - 60x = 45 * (15 - x) 720 - 60x = 675 - 45x -60x + 45x = 675 - 720 -15x = -45 x = 3 Mary must put back 3 oranges so that the average price of the pieces of fruit she keeps is boxed{45} cents."},{"prompt":"Mr. Bodhi is transporting some animals using a yacht across a river.

According to the information given, there are three times as many zebras as foxes, so the number of zebras is 3F. We know that Mr. Bodhi has 20 cows and decided to add 20 sheep to the yacht. So, the total number of cows and sheep is 20 + 20 = 40. The total number of animals needed to balance the yacht is 100. So, the sum of cows, sheep, foxes, and zebras should equal 100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: Number of cows + Number of sheep + Number of foxes + Number of zebras = Total number of animals 20 (cows) + 20 (sheep) + F (foxes) + 3F (zebras) = 100 Combining like terms, we get: 40 + F + 3F = 100 4F + 40 = 100 Now, we'll solve for F: 4F = 100 - 40 4F = 60 Divide both sides by 4 to find the number of foxes: F = 60 / 4 F = 15 Mr. Bodhi had boxed{15} foxes."},{"prompt":"1.

Substituting b^2 = 4ac into M, we get: [ M = frac{a + 3b + 4c}{b - a} = frac{a^2 + 3ab + 4ac}{ab - a^2} = frac{a^2 + 3ab + b^2}{ab - a^2} ] Let's introduce a substitution t = frac{b}{a} - 1 > 0, which implies frac{b}{a} = t + 1. Substituting this into our expression for M, we get: [ M = frac{1 + 3(t + 1) + (t + 1)^2}{t} = frac{t^2 + 5t + 5}{t} = t + frac{5}{t} + 5 ] By the AM-GM inequality, we know that t + frac{5}{t} geq 2sqrt{t cdot frac{5}{t}} = 2sqrt{5}.

Therefore, the function f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, a) and monotonically increasing on (a, +infty). Thus, when x = a, f_{min}(x) = ln a + 1. Since f(1) = ln 1 + a > 0, For the function f(x) to have a zero, ln a + 1 leqslant 0, That is 0 < a leqslant frac{1}{e}. Therefore, the range of the real number a is boxed{(0, frac{1}{e}]}.

So we need to subtract the number of students who like both from the total to avoid double-counting: Number of students who like French fries or burgers = (Number who like French fries) + (Number who like burgers) - (Number who like both) Number of students who like French fries or burgers = 15 + 10 - 6 Number of students who like French fries or burgers = 25 - 6 Number of students who like French fries or burgers = 19 Now we know that 19 students like at least one of the foods. To find out how many students do not like either food, we subtract this number from the total number of students in the class: Number of students who do not like either food = Total number of students - Number who like at least one food Number of students who do not like either food = 25 - 19 Number of students who do not like either food = 6 So, boxed{6} students do not like either French fries or burgers."},{"prompt":"he fifth grade at parkway elementary school there are 500 students . 350 students are boys and 250 students are playing soccer . 86 % of the students that play soccer are boys . how many girl student are in parkway that is not playing soccer ?","completion":"First, let's find out how many boys are playing soccer.

What is the minimum number of times this process needs to be performed so that the (unordered) array of numbers written on the cards becomes unique for each card?","completion":"Given: A deck of 54 cards is divided into several stacks. On each card, the number written equals the number of cards in its stack. The process of dividing and writing continues until each card has a unique set of numbers. To solve this, let's follow these detailed steps: 1. **Initial Notation and First Division**: Suppose the cards are divided into k_1 stacks during the first division. Each stack will then have numbers based on the count of cards in that stack. Therefore, after the first division, the numbers on the cards are not guaranteed to be unique because two cards might share the same stack number. 2. **Second Division**: Upon a second division, suppose the maximum count of cards in any stack formed is k_2. The process involves dividing these k_1 stacks into new stacks, leading to each card in a stack receiving a new number corresponding to its stack in this division. Here, there still might not be a unique set of numbers for each card. 3. **Third Division**: During this third division, further separate the cards into stacks such that each card now acquires a new number representative of its current stack count. This is essential because: - Post two divisions, a pair of cards (m_1, n_1) and (n_1, m_1) might still have the same number combination, leading them to not be unique. - The goal is to ensure all cards have a different combination. By the third division, the stacks operate in such a way that cards in any (m_1, n_1) setup now are divided into distinct thirds, making the numbers fully unique. The detailed implementation follows: - Consider the most densely packed configuration of the previously held stack's numbers and further segregate them intelligently into newly defined divisions ensuring all unique configurations. 4. **Verification of Optimal Divisions**: - Suppose we argue if two divisions were enough, we'd try and refute it by examining a card setup where k_1 and k_2 still leave duplicate count configurations in some cards. Even after attempting a couple of contented divisions, there’s always a situation where a (m_1, n_1) setup still exists. 5. **Conclusion from Verification**: - The third division creates this stack uniqueness impeccably by adding another layer (m_1, n_1, k_3) making identification possible distinct for all cards. # Determining Necessity and Insufficiency: To affirm, two divisions being insufficient can be demonstrated by: - If there exist configurations (k_1, k_2) inducing mappings between duplicate number setups k times k configurations, additional divisions become impedimentally necessary to fulfill the unique sequence requirement. # Final Conclusion: Thus, it verifies: boxed{3} is the minimum number of divisions required to ensure all inscriptions on each card are uniquely different."},{"prompt":"a 2016 college art examination, there were 6 contestants, including 3 females and 3 males.

Therefore, there are {A_4^3} = 4 times 3 times 2 ways to arrange the females and insert the 3 males in these gaps without any two males being consecutive.

Consider a three-sided dihedral angle with vertex O. We place equal segments OA, OB, and OC on the edges of the dihedral angle (see figure 11 in the problem statement). Let OB_1 = -OB. 2. Note that the triangles B_1OC, AOB, and AOC are isosceles since two of their sides are equal (e.g., OA = OB, OB = OB_1, etc.). This implies that the angle bisectors of these triangles are also medians. Therefore, the bisectors OK, OM, and OP are medians of these triangles. 3. Use the vectors overline{OA}, overline{OB}, and overline{OC} as basis vectors and express the bisectors in terms of these basis vectors: - For overline{OM} (the bisector of angle AOB): [ overline{OM} = 0.5 overline{OB} + 0.5 overline{OA} ] - For overline{OP} (the bisector of angle AOC): [ overline{OP} = 0.5 overline{OA} + 0.5 overline{OC} ] - For overline{OK} (the bisector of angle COB_1): Since OB_1 = -OB, we have: [ overline{OK} = 0.5 overline{OB_1} + 0.5 overline{OC} = 0.5 (-overline{OB}) + 0.5 overline{OC} = -0.5 overline{OB} + 0.5 overline{OC} ] 4.

For our parabola, y=a(x+2)^2+3, the axis of symmetry is x=-2. **Step 2: Compare the distances of points A and B from the axis of symmetry.** - The distance from point A(-1, y_{1}) to the axis of symmetry x=-2 is |-1 - (-2)| = 1. - The distance from point B(2, y_{2}) to the axis of symmetry x=-2 is |2 - (-2)| = 4. Since the parabola opens downwards and is symmetric about the axis x=-2, points closer to the axis of symmetry will have a higher y-value than points further away. **Step 3: Determine the relationship between y_{1} and y_{2}.** Given that point A is closer to the axis of symmetry than point B, and knowing the parabola opens downwards, it follows that y_{1} > y_{2}. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the correct relationship between y_{1} and y_{2} is y_{1} > y_{2}, which corresponds to choice boxed{A}."},{"prompt":"Calculate the sum of the first four terms of the geometric series 1 + left(frac{1}{3}right) + left(frac{1}{3}right)^2 + left(frac{1}{3}right)^3.","completion":"This is a finite geometric series with: - the first term a = 1 - the common ratio r = frac{1}{3} - number of terms n = 4 The formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is S_n = a frac{1-r^n}{1-r}.

So, f(x+4) = f(x), Thus, the period of f(x) is 4. Also, f(1) = 4, f(10) = f(6) + f(2) = 3f(2) = 0. So, f(3) + f(10) = f(-1) + f(2) = f(1) + f(2) = 4 + 0 = 4.

Prove that from the played matches, it is possible to select some such that each team has exactly one loss and exactly one win in these selected matches.","completion":"1. **Modeling the Tournament:** Represent each team by a vertex in a directed graph. For each match played, draw a directed edge from the winning team to the losing team. Consequently, if team A defeats team B, there is a directed edge from vertex A to vertex B. 2. **Indegree and Outdegree:** Given that every team has exactly 10 wins and 10 losses, each vertex in this directed graph has an outdegree of 10 and an indegree of 10. An outdegree of 10 means there are 10 edges going out from the vertex, representing 10 wins, and an indegree of 10 means there are 10 edges coming into the vertex, representing 10 losses. 3. **Choosing Starting Point:** Pick any vertex, say vertex A, which represents some team in the tournament. 4. **Exploring the Edges:** From vertex A, follow an outgoing edge to vertex B (since there are 10 outgoing edges, pick one arbitrarily), then follow an outgoing edge from vertex B to some vertex C, and continue this process. [ A rightarrow B rightarrow C rightarrow cdots ] Here, eventually, due to the finiteness of vertices and equal indegree and outdegree, you must revisit a vertex, because each vertex you leave still has remaining unused edges. This process must result in the formation of a cycle. 5. **Cycle Formation:** Since each team has the same number of wins and losses, continuing the process of following outgoing edges guarantees that every vertex (team) will appear in exactly one cycle in this directed graph. This cycle consists of sequences of wins and losses with victory paths forming the edges. 6. **Identification of the Required Matches:** The cycle formed in the previous step represents a sequence of matches where each team has exactly one win and one loss. Select the matches corresponding to the edges in this cycle. Since the cycle allows us to revisit vertices and complete the path, it provides a consistent way to count exactly one win and one loss for each team participating in that cycle. 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, from the given matches, one can always select matches that form a cycle wherein each participating team has exactly one victory and one defeat.

This works because each term that is a multiple of (k) (e.g., (k, 3k, 5k, ldots)) shares the same greatest power of 2 as (k) when multiplied by an odd number: [ a_k = a_{3k} = a_{5k} = a_{7k} = ldots ] This is due to the fact that multiplying (k) by an odd number doesn't add any additional powers of 2 to the product. 6.

Their total weekly income before the wage increase is ( W times H ). After a 25% increase, the new hourly wage is ( W + 0.25W = 1.25W ). The employee wants to work fewer hours so that their total weekly income remains the same. Let's call the new number of hours worked ( H' ). The equation for the new total weekly income, which should be equal to the original income, is: ( 1.25W times H' = W times H ) To find ( H' ), we divide both sides of the equation by ( 1.25W ): ( H' = frac{W times H}{1.25W} ) ( H' = frac{H}{1.25} ) ( H' = H times 0.8 ) This means the new number of hours worked is 80% of the original hours worked.

According to the problem, a third of the profit (P/3) is divided equally between John and Mike for their efforts. This means that each of them gets (P/6) from this portion of the profit. The remaining profit, which is two-thirds of the total profit (2P/3), is divided in the ratio of their investments. John invested 700 and Mike invested 300, so the total investment is 1000. The ratio of their investments is 700:300, which simplifies to 7:3. John's share of the remaining profit is (7/10) of (2P/3), and Mike's share of the remaining profit is (3/10) of (2P/3). John's total share is the sum of his equal share and his investment-based share: John's total share = (P/6) + (7/10) * (2P/3) Mike's total share is the sum of his equal share and his investment-based share: Mike's total share = (P/6) + (3/10) * (2P/3) According to the problem, John received 800 more than Mike did. So we can set up the following equation: John's total share = Mike's total share + 800 (P/6) + (7/10) * (2P/3) = (P/6) + (3/10) * (2P/3) + 800 To solve for P, we first simplify the equation: (P/6) + (7/10) * (2P/3) = (P/6) + (3/10) * (2P/3) + 800 (P/6) + (14P/30) = (P/6) + (6P/30) + 800 Now, we combine like terms: (P/6) + (14P/30) - (P/6) - (6P/30) = 800 (14P/30) - (6P/30) = 800 (8P/30) = 800 Now, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (8/30) to solve for P: P = 800 * (30/8) P = 800 * (15/4) P = 800 * 3.75 P = 3000 The profit made by their business in that year was boxed{3000} ."},{"prompt":"A shopkeeper applies an initial 10% discount on an article's cost price, followed by a 5% tax on the discounted price.

Suppose these form an arithmetic sequence, then: [ 2C_n^j = C_n^{j-1} + C_n^{j+1} ] Simplify using properties of binomial coefficients: [ 2 frac{n!}{j!(n-j)!} = frac{n!}{(j-1)!(n-(j-1))!} + frac{n!}{(j+1)!(n-(j+1))!} ] After simplification, it reduces to the polynomial equation: [ n + 2 = (n - 2j)^2. ] Thus n + 2 is a perfect square. 3. **Conclusion for k=3**: Since we can find n such that n+2 is a perfect square, k=3 thus satisfies condition (b) but not (a). 4. **Consideration for k=4**: Next, explore k=4: Suppose C_n^j, C_n^{j+1}, C_n^{j+2} form an arithmetic progression: - Following similar steps, we solve: [ 2C_n^{j+1} = C_n^j + C_n^{j+2}. ] This reduces to: [ n + 2 = (n - 2(j+1))^2. ] Which implies: [ |n - 2j - 2| = |n - 2j - 4| ] This implies: [ n - 2j - 2 = -(n - 2j - 4) quad implies quad n = 2j + 3. ] Leading to contradiction as the sequences would overlap. 5. **Verification of (a) for k=4**: The set up results in contradictions indicating k=4 satisfies (a): - No valid sequence can form as arithmetic with C_{2j+3}^j falling back equivalencies which cannot be the same essentially forming contradictions in binomial coefficients. - As such k<5 cannot hold arithmetic forms. 6. **Exploring for k<5 and Combining both Conditions (a) and (b)**: Following constraints, k=4 remains valid satisfying (a) while forming sequences indicating (b) where: [ n = m^2 - 2 quad (m in mathbb{N}, mgeq 3). ] # Conclusion: The appropriate integer k satisfying both properties with corresponding n is boxed.

[ b_i = frac{1}{2}g_i implies g_i = 2b_i ] 4. **Total Problems Solved in Each Pair**: - From Scenario 1: [ b_i + g_i = 2g_i + g_i = 3g_i ] - From Scenario 2: [ b_i + g_i = b_i + 2b_i = 3b_i ] In both scenarios, the total number of problems solved in each pair is a multiple of 3. 5. **Sum of Problems Solved by All Pairs**: - Let ( n ) be the number of pairs. - Total number of problems solved by all children is the sum of the number of problems solved by each pair. - Since each pair contributes a number of problems divisible by 3: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} (b_i + g_i) = 3k ] for some integer ( k ), making the total sum divisible by 3. 6. **Verification**: - 2000 must be divisible by 3 for it to be the total number solved by all children. - Checking the divisibility: - Sum the digits of 2000: (2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2 ). - ( 2 ) is not divisible by ( 3 ). Since 2000 is not divisible by 3, it cannot be the total number of solved problems. # Conclusion: The total number of problems solved by all the children cannot be 2000.

I. Solution: 1. We will show that either the triangle (PQR) or (PQS) contains a lattice point other than its vertices, and, if there is a lattice point inside triangle (EPS) or triangle (EQR), then by replacing vertex (S) or (R) it suffices to prove the statement for a smaller quadrilateral that also satisfies the problem conditions. 2. The statement that the quadrilateral (PQRS) contains some lattice point is clear since a finite number of lattice points exist within the polygon. By repeatedly applying the procedure described, we will eventually reach a configuration where no lattice point is inside the triangles (EPS) or (EQR). Now, according to the first statement, the triangle (PQR) or (PQS) must contain a lattice point that also lies in the triangle (EPQ) and is different from points (P) and (Q). 3. To prove the above, we consider if there exists a lattice point (T) inside the triangle (EQR), implying that replacing (R) by (T) which lies closer to (PQ) than (S), the newly formed quadrilateral (PQT) retains all problem conditions due to the fact that (T) replaces (R). Let's now present the detailed steps: 1. **Assumption and Verification**: Suppose there exists no lattice point within the triangles: - Exhibit that triangle (PQR) or (PQS) contains a lattice point since all vertices are lattice points and the entire polygon (PQRS) cannot be void of lattice points due to its bounded nature. 2. **Translating the Setup**: Denoting the coordinates of vertices (P, R, S, T) as ((p_1, p_2), (r_1, r_2), (s_1, s_2), (t_1, t_2)) respectively, if we assert that constructing parallelogram (P, R, S, T) retains integer coordinates and lattice points. The equations of diagonals: begin{align*} frac{p_1 + r_1}{2} = frac{t_1 + s_1}{2} frac{p_2 + r_2}{2} = frac{t_2 + s_2}{2} end{align*} Solving for (T) we get: begin{equation*} t_i = p_i + r_i - s_i quad text{for } i=1,2 end{equation*} These are indeed integers, verifying the presence of integer-lattice points thus confirms the first part of the desired proof. II. Analysis with General Assertions: Considering any plane lattice asserts: - Any line containing two lattice points will consequently contain infinitely many, equidistantly spaced. Given points (E, F,) and (G) with displacement vectors (vec{e}, vec{f}, vec{g}): Reflecting point (G) across the midpoint between (E) and (F), provides: begin{align*} overrightarrow{GG'} = overrightarrow{GE} + overrightarrow{GF} G' = G + overrightarrow{GE} + overrightarrow{GF} = vec{e} + vec{f} - vec{g} end{align*} Hence (G') is also a lattice point. # The Third Segment: By focusing on parallelogram properties: - Any empty lattice triangle that has no internal or boundary lattice points has an invariant area. Therefore, any scenario where triangles (PQR) and (PQS) dissect into empty lattice triangles disproves the hypothesis (PQSgeq PQR), resolving by theorem application: [ boxed{text{The sum of angles at } P text{ and } Q text{ containing a lattice point continues to hold, thus proving a lattice point exists aligning the statement.}} ] This concludes our required solution with the boxed theorem applied contextually.

We need to show that any plane cutting through the pyramid creates a polygonal section whose perimeter is less than or equal to the perimeter of the largest of these four triangular faces. 2. **Consider a Section Cut by a Plane**: Let's consider a plane intersecting the pyramid and creating a polygonal section. This section can either be a triangle, quadrilateral, or a polygon with more sides. The key insight here is that this section lies entirely within the tetrahedron. 3. **Properties of Perimeter and Intersecting Plane**: - The section formed by the plane can be considered as a projection or intersection of the tetrahedron with the plane. - By the triangle inequality, we know the perimeter of a triangle is less than or equal to the sum of the side lengths. 4. **Comparison to Face Perimeters**: - Denote the lengths of edges of the tetrahedron as DA = a_1, DB = a_2, DC = a_3, AB = a_4, BC = a_5, and CA = a_6. - The perimeter of face triangle DAB is a_1 + a_2 + a_4. - The perimeter of face triangle DBC is a_2 + a_3 + a_5. - The perimeter of face triangle DAC is a_1 + a_3 + a_6. - The perimeter of face triangle ABC is a_4 + a_5 + a_6. 5. **Bounding the Section Perimeter**: - Let the intersecting plane form a polygon whose vertices are intersections of the plane with the edges of the tetrahedron. - No matter how the section cuts through the tetrahedron, every edge it intersects belongs to one of the tetrahedron edges—it cannot exceed the sum of edges from any face. 6. **Maximizing the Perimeter**: - The sum of the edges creating the section per perimeter is constrained because these edges are part of the tetrahedron itself. - Thus, the plane section's perimeter is bounded by the total edge lengths of the tetrahedron faces. Specifically, it cannot exceed the largest triangular face perimeter. 7. **Final Comparison**: - By considering all possible sections and using the boundedness by the face perimeters, we conclude the section’s perimeter remains within the maximum perimeter of any face triangle. # Conclusion: The perimeter of any section of the triangular pyramid DABC made by a plane does not exceed the largest perimeter of its faces. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A plane flies some miles with a tail wind in 3 hours.

Consider the case when (0 < alpha + beta < pi): - If (0 < alpha + beta < frac{pi}{2}), then (cos alpha > cos (frac{pi}{2} - beta) = sin beta > 0). - Hence, (cos^2 alpha > sin^2 beta) and (cos beta > cos (frac{pi}{2} - alpha) = sin alpha > 0 ). 4.

When the boat is going downstream, the current of the river helps it move faster. The downstream speed is the distance covered divided by the time taken to cover that distance. Downstream speed = Distance / Time taken downstream Downstream speed = 10 km / 3 hr Downstream speed = 3.33 km/hr (recurring) Next, let's calculate the upstream speed.

Let's start by rearranging and factoring the given equation: [ p^2 - q^2 = r^n ] This can be factored as: [ (p-q)(p+q) = r^n ] Next, we need to consider the possible factorization since ( r ) is a prime number and ( r^n ) must be a product of two factors. Let’s look at the two primary cases: Case 1: ( p - q = 1 ) If ( p - q = 1 ), then ( p = q + 1 ). Substituting this into our factorization: [ (p-q)(p+q) = (1)(p+q) ] [ r^n = p+q ] Since ( p = q + 1 ), this becomes: [ r^n = (q+1) + q ] [ r^n = 2q + 1 ] Since ( q ) and ( r ) are primes and ( r ) divides ( 2q + 1 ), we can test small primes: - Let ( q = 2 ): [ p = q + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 ] [ 3^2 = 2^2 + r^n implies 9 = 4 + r^n implies r^n = 5 ] Since ( r ) is a prime, ( r = 5 ) and ( n = 1 ).

Let’s set ( p - q = r^a ) and ( p + q = r^b ) such that ( a + b = n ) with ( 1 leq a < b ).

Now, let's find out how much work they can complete in 4 days: 4 days * (7/60) of the work per day = 28/60 of the work To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4: 28/60 = (28/4) / (60/4) = 7/15 So, p and q can complete 7/15 of the work in 4 days. To find the fraction of work left, we subtract the work completed from the total work (which is 1, representing the whole work): 1 - 7/15 = (15/15) - (7/15) = 8/15 Therefore, the fraction of work left after p and q worked together for 4 days is boxed{8/15} ."},{"prompt":"What are all values of p so that for every q > 0, the inequality [frac{5(pq^2 + p^2q + 4q^2 + 4pq)}{p + q} > 3p^2q] holds?

The distance formula gives us: [frac{|2k-1-k|}{sqrt{k^2+1}} = 2.] Simplifying the absolute value and squaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives: [frac{(k-1)^2}{k^2+1} = 4.] Further simplification leads to: [k^2 - 2k + 1 = 4k^2 + 4.] Rearranging terms: [3k^2 + 2k + 3 = 0.] The discriminant Delta of this quadratic equation is: [Delta = 2^2 - 4 cdot 3 cdot 3 = 4 - 36 = -32 < 0.] Since Delta < 0, there are no real solutions for k, meaning there does not exist a real number k such that the line l is tangent to circle M. Therefore, statement C is incorrect. **For statement D:** If we set k=1, the line equation becomes l: x-y-1=0. The center of the circle (2,1) satisfies this equation: [2-1-1=0.] This means the center of the circle lies on the line, and thus, the chord cut off by the line from the circle is actually the diameter of the circle, which is 2r=2cdot2=4. Since the diameter is the longest possible chord, the length of the longest chord being 2sqrt{2} is incorrect. Therefore, statement D is incorrect.

Hence, the total becomes ( 1 - 1 + 5 = 5 ) (odd number). - Inserting a 10-kopeck coin: Petya exchanges 1 coin for 5 coins, leading to a net gain of 4 coins. Hence, the total becomes ( 1 - 1 + 5 = 5 ) (odd number). 4. **Maintaining Odd Total**: - Each insertion operation increases the quantity of coins by 4, which is an even number. - Therefore, the parity does not change. Every time Petya inserts a coin, the total number of coins remains odd. 5. **Impossible Situation**: - For Petya to have an equal number (even distribution) of both types of coins, he would need an even total number of coins. Since he always ends up with an odd number of coins, it is clear that having an equal quantity of 2-kopeck and 10-kopeck coins is not possible.

Given that the trapezoid is isosceles, we know that the diagonals are equal in length, and we can use the property of the diagonals in an isosceles trapezoid. 2. We will use the Pythagorean Theorem and other properties of trapezoids to derive the relation. 3. Apply the relation of the diagonals in an isosceles trapezoid, which is derived from the distance formula in coordinate geometry. This leads to the equation: [ x cdot y + z^2 = u^2 ] 4. Let's explore possible values that satisfy this equation. We assume: [ x = 2t^2, quad y = 2rs, quad z = (r-s)t, quad u = (r+s)t ] for some integers ( r, s, t ). 5.

If we assume the garden is rectangular, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is: Area = Length × Width We have the area, but we don't have the width or the length of the garden. However, we can express the length of the garden in terms of its width. Let's call the width of the garden \\"w\\" and the length of the garden \\"l\\".

We can rearrange the equation to solve for \\"l\\": l = 28125 / w We don't have the exact width of the garden, but we can still find the ratio of the length of the garden to the length of the property. The length of the property is 2250 feet. So the ratio of the length of the garden to the length of the property is: Ratio = l / 2250 Substituting the expression for \\"l\\" we found earlier: Ratio = (28125 / w) / 2250 We can simplify this by dividing 28125 by 2250: Ratio = 28125 / (w × 2250) Now, we can simplify the ratio further by dividing 28125 by 2250: Ratio = 28125 / 2250 / w Ratio = 12.5 / w Since we don't have the value of \\"w\\", we cannot simplify the ratio further.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Analyzing the Problem:** - We know there are 2n+1 batteries and (n+1) good ones. - The flashlight lights up if and only if both batteries inserted are good. 2. **Evaluation of Attempts:** - Suppose we are to make at least n+1 attempts. - Let's assume in each attempt, the same battery is used twice among these attempts and mark it as bad. - In the remaining n-1 attempts, each with different batteries picked, we mark these batteries as bad as well. 3. **Why n+2 Attempts are Necessary:** - If indeed the flashlight doesn't light up in n+1 attempts, that implies all n bad batteries have been tested in different pairs. - Therefore, we need at least one more attempt beyond n+1 to be certain to detect the good batteries in each collection. 4. **Example Strategy:** - Separate the batteries into n groups where one group has 3 batteries and the others have 2 each. - Verify all possible pairs within each group.

Since the second circle touches ( CD ) at ( (r, h - 4r) = (r, r) ), the tangent line ( t ) is at height ( r ) from ( CD ). Therefore, ( I ) is the midpoint of ( CD ), and ( ID = DC ). 6. **Determine the ratio in which the common tangent divides ( AB ) and ( CD ):** - Since ( H ) is the midpoint of ( AB ), the ratio ( frac{AH}{HB} = 1 ). - Since ( I ) is the midpoint of ( CD ), the ratio ( frac{ID}{DC} = 1 ). Therefore, the common tangent divides both ( AB ) and ( CD ) in the ratio ( 1:1 ). The final answer is ( boxed{ 1:1 } )."},{"prompt":"A food factory regularly purchases flour. It is known that the factory needs 6 tons of flour per day, and the price of each ton of flour is 1800 yuan.

(1) How often should the factory purchase flour to minimize the average daily total cost? (2) If the flour supplier offers a 10% discount (i.e., 90% of the original price) for purchases of at least 210 tons of flour at a time, should the factory consider taking advantage of this offer? Please explain your reasoning.","completion":"Solution: (1) Let the factory purchase flour every x days, so the purchase amount is 6x tons. According to the problem, the storage and other costs are 3[6x+6(x-1)+…+6times2+6times1]=9x(x+1). Let the average daily total cost be y_1 yuan, then y_1 = frac{1}{x}[9x(x+1)+900]+6times1800 = frac{900}{x}+9x+10809 geq 2sqrt{frac{900}{x} cdot 9x}+10809 =10989. Equality holds if and only if 9x= frac{900}{x}, i.e., x=10. Thus, the factory should purchase flour every boxed{10} days to minimize the average daily total cost. (2) If the factory takes advantage of this discount, it must purchase flour at least every 35 days, and the average daily total cost is y_2 yuan, then y_2 = frac{1}{x}[9x(x+1)+900]+6times1800times0.90 = frac{900}{x}+9x+9729 (for xgeq35). Let f(x)=x+ frac{100}{x} (for xgeq35), If x_2>x_1geq35, then f(x_1)-f(x_2)=(x_1+ frac{100}{x_1})-(x_2+ frac{100}{x_2}) = frac{(x_2-x_1)(100-x_1x_2)}{x_1x_2} Since x_2>x_1geq35, x_2-x_1>0, x_1x_2>0, 100-x_1x_2<0. Thus, f(x_1)-f(x_2)<0, f(x_1)<f(x_2), meaning f(x)=x+ frac{100}{x} is an increasing function when xgeq35. Therefore, when x=35, f(x) has its minimum value, and at this time y_2<10989.

Given that f'(x) < 0 for the interval a < x < b, it implies that f(x) is a decreasing function on this interval. Therefore, for all x in (a, b), f(x) will be greater than f(b) because as x approaches b from the left, the value of f(x) is decreasing towards f(b). Given that it is stipulated that f(b) > 0, by transitivity we can conclude that f(x) > f(b) > 0 for all x in (a, b). Here is the step-by-step reasoning: 1. Since f'(x) < 0 on the interval (a, b), we deduce that f(x) is strictly decreasing on this interval. 2. As x gets closer to b from the left side of (a, b), the values of f(x) will keep decreasing until they approach the value of f(b). 3. Since f(b) is given to be greater than zero, f(x) will also be greater than zero for all x in the interval (a, b), because a decreasing function cannot cross from positive to negative without first passing through zero.

This does not lead to a valid solution for t. - **Case 3:** For frac{2 pi}{7} le x le frac{5 pi}{14}, the terms become x, pi - 2x, 7x - 2 pi. Solving the GP condition, we find x = frac{pi}{3}, leading to r = 1 and the smallest t being 1. However, this does not satisfy the conditions for the least positive value of t. - **Case 4:** For frac{5 pi}{14} le x le frac{3 pi}{7}, solving the GP condition yields x = frac{(7 pm sqrt{5}) pi}{22}. The valid solution for x is x = frac{(7 + sqrt{5}) pi}{22}, leading to a common ratio r = frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2}. 6. **Finding the Value of t:** - The fourth term of the GP is x cdot r^3 = x cdot left( frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2} right)^3 = (9 - 4 sqrt{5}) x. - Thus, the least positive value of t such that arcsin (sin tx) = (9 - 4 sqrt{5}) x is t = boxed{9 - 4 sqrt{5}}.

Since Bryan had 8 stones and each was sold for 1785, the total cost would be: Total cost without discount = Number of stones * Price per stone Total cost without discount = 8 * 1785 Total cost without discount = 14280 Now, let's calculate the discount amount. A 12% discount on the total cost would be: Discount amount = Total cost without discount * Discount percentage Discount amount = 14280 * 12% Discount amount = 14280 * 0.12 Discount amount = 1713.6 Finally, let's calculate the total amount Bryan got after the discount was applied: Total amount with discount = Total cost without discount - Discount amount Total amount with discount = 14280 - 1713.6 Total amount with discount = 12566.4 So, Bryan got boxed{12566.4} in total after the discount."},{"prompt":"Two students, A and B, are doing rope skipping training.

Given that A skips 19 more times per minute than B, we can express the number of times A skips per minute as x + 19. The problem states that A takes the same amount of time to skip 300 times as B does to skip 270 times. This can be translated into the equation that relates their skipping rates: [ frac{300}{x + 19} = frac{270}{x} ] To solve for x, we cross-multiply: [ 300x = 270(x + 19) ] Expanding the equation: [ 300x = 270x + 5130 ] Subtracting 270x from both sides: [ 30x = 5130 ] Dividing both sides by 30: [ x = frac{5130}{30} ] Simplifying: [ x = 171 ] This means B skips 171 times per minute. To find out how many times A skips per minute, we add 19 to B's rate: [ x + 19 = 171 + 19 = 190 ] Therefore, A skips 190 times per minute and B skips 171 times per minute.

According to the information given, he took ( x + 630 ) selfies this year. The total number of selfies in his gallery is the sum of the selfies from last year and this year, which is ( 2430 ). Therefore, we can write the equation: [ x + (x + 630) = 2430 ] Combining like terms, we get: [ 2x + 630 = 2430 ] Subtracting 630 from both sides, we get: [ 2x = 2430 - 630 ] [ 2x = 1800 ] Dividing both sides by 2, we find: [ x = 900 ] So, Malachi took 900 selfies last year. The number of selfies he took this year is ( 900 + 630 = 1530 ). The ratio of the number of selfies he took last year to this year is: [ frac{900}{1530} ] To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 90: [ frac{900 div 90}{1530 div 90} = frac{10}{17} ] So, the ratio of the number of selfies Malachi took last year to this year is ( boxed{10:17} )."},{"prompt":"The slope of the line x+sqrt{3}y1=0 is ( ).

A draw is possible. What is more likely to happen in such a match: that the total number of goals scored will be even or that it will be odd?","completion":"1. Let ( p ) be the probability that the total number of goals scored in a football match is even. Consequently, the probability that the total number of goals scored is odd is ( q = 1 - p ). 2. Consider each half of the match separately. Let ( p_1 ) be the probability that the number of goals scored in the first half is even, and let ( q_1 = 1 - p_1 ) be the probability that the number of goals scored in the first half is odd. The same reasoning applies to the second half of the match, with probabilities ( p_1 ) and ( q_1 ). 3. We assume that the goals scored in the second half of the match are independent of the goals scored in the first half. Thus, the overall number of goals scored in the match can be analyzed by combining the outcomes of the two halves. 4. The total number of even goals in the match can occur in two ways: - An even number of goals in both halves. - An odd number of goals in both halves. Therefore, the probability of an even total number of goals is: [ p = p_1 cdot p_1 + q_1 cdot q_1 = p_1^2 + (1 - p_1)^2 = p_1^2 + 1 - 2p_1 + p_1^2 = 2p_1^2 - 2p_1 + 1 ] 5. The total number of odd goals in the match can only occur if one half has an even number of goals and the other half has an odd number of goals. Hence, the probability of an odd total number of goals is: [ q = 2p_1 q_1 = 2p_1 (1 - p_1) = 2p_1 - 2p_1^2 ] 6. To determine which of ( p ) or ( q ) is greater, let’s calculate ( p - q ): [ p - q = (p_1^2 + (1 - p_1)^2) - 2p_1(1 - p_1) = p_1^2 + (1 - 2p_1 + p_1^2) - 2p_1 + 2p_1^2 ] Simplify, [ p - q = p_1^2 + 1 - 2p_1 + p_1^2 -(2p_1 - 2p_1^2) = p_1^2 + 1 - 2p_1 + p_1^2 + 2p_1^2 - 2p_1 + 1 ] Combine like terms, [ p - q = p_1^2 - q_1^2)p_1^2 - (p_1 - q_1)^2 = left(p_1 - (1 - p_1) right)^2 ] Therefore, [ p - q = left(p_1 - q_1 right)^2 geq 0 ] 7. Since ( (p_1 - q_1)^2 geq 0 ), this demonstrates that ( p geq q ). 8. We further validate that ( p neq q ) through the following argument: - If we continue dividing the match into smaller segments using ( k )-th segments, the probability of scoring at least one goal in a very short interval tends to zero because football goals are sparse events. As ( p_k approx 1 ), we can say ( p_k > q_k ). Thus, [ p - q = (p_k - q_k)^{2k} > 0 ] # Conclusion: Since ( p = q ) cannot happen and ( p geq q ), we conclude that the probability of the total number of goals being even is higher than it being odd.

This means ( O, K, ) and ( E ) share a right-angled vertex. 6. **Proving Right Angles at ( K ) and ( N ):** - We further observe that ( angle AOK ) and ( angle DON ) are each ( 90^circ ), making ( K ) and ( N ) potential points for the circumcircle involving diametrically opposed points. 7. **Conclusion: Circle through Four Points:** - The previous steps establish that both ( angle KOB = angle KNM = 90^circ ) and these two common right angles provide the quadrilateral ( OKMN ) the necessary constraint to be cyclic. - Thus, by definition of cyclic quadrilaterals and their properties of inscribed angles, points ( O, K, M, ) and ( N ) are indeed concyclic—they lie on the same circle. # Final Conclusion: [ boxed{O, K, M, text{ and } N text{ all lie on the same circle.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let triangle XYZ be a right triangle with Y as the right angle.

Part (2)① For the event \\"the card drawn next is a diamond\\" to be a certain event, all the remaining cards must be diamonds. This means all spades and hearts must be removed: - Total hearts removed = 9 - Total spades to be removed to ensure only diamonds are left = 10 (since there are 10 spades in total) Thus, for the event to be certain, m = 10. Therefore, the value of m for which the event \\"the card drawn next is a diamond\\" is a certain event is boxed{m = 10}.

We can simplify this into a right triangle by considering the difference in height between the two poles as one leg and the distance between the poles as the other leg. 1. The distance between the bottoms of the poles is given as 12 feet. This forms one leg of the right triangle. 2. The difference in height between the two poles is 15 - 6 = 9 feet. This forms the other leg of the right triangle. 3. To find the length of the wire, which corresponds to the hypotenuse of the right triangle, we apply the Pythagorean Theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2. 4.

Prove that there exists an integer (N) such that for all integers (x geq N), the number (P(x)) is divisible by a prime number greater than 20.","completion":"# Problem: Let ( P(x) = (x + d_1)(x + d_2) cdots (x + d_9) ) where ( d_1, ldots, d_9 ) are distinct integers. Show that there exists an integer ( N ) such that for all integers ( x geq N ), the number ( P(x) ) is divisible by a prime number greater than 20. 1. **Introduction and Initial Assumption**: We start by recognizing that there are exactly 8 prime numbers less than or equal to 20, which are (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19). Since (P(x)) is a product of 9 factors, we can utilize the pigeonhole principle. 2. **Proof by Contradiction**: Assume, for contradiction, that there are infinitely many integers ( n ) such that (P(n)) is not divisible by any prime greater than 20. Hence, for such integers ( n ), ( P(n) ) has all prime factors less than or equal to 20. 3. **Choosing Prime Factors**: By the pigeonhole principle, with 9 factors and only 8 primes less than or equal to 20, there must be at least one prime ( p ) among (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19) that divides at least two of the factors ( n+d_i ) and ( n+d_j ) for some ( i neq j ). 4. **Divisibility Argument**: For the prime ( p ) and indices ( i ) and ( j ), if ( p ) divides both ( n+d_i ) and ( n+d_j ), then ( p ) divides their difference: [ p mid (n + d_i) - (n + d_j) implies p mid (d_i - d_j) ] Since ( d_i ) and ( d_j ) are distinct integers, ( d_i - d_j ) is non-zero, and thus, we have finitely many possible values for ( d_i - d_j ). 5. **Unbounded Sequence**: By assumption, there exists a sequence ((x_n)) such that for all ( n ), ( P(x_n) ) has no prime factors greater than 20. The sequence ( (x_n + d_1)_n ) is unbounded. Therefore, there exists a prime ( p_1 < 20 ) for which the sequence of ( p_1 )-adic valuations ( (v_{p_1}(x_n + d_1))_n ) is unbounded. 6. **Subsequent Primes**: By extracting a subsequence if necessary, we can assume the ( p_1 )-adic valuation ( v_{p_1}((y_n + d_1)_n) ) tends to (infty ) for some subsequence ((y_n)). Repeating this argument for each (d_i), we find primes ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_9 ) such that the valuations ( v_{p_i}((x_n + d_i)_n) ) tend to (infty). 7. **Pigeonhole Principle Applied**: Since there are only 8 primes less than or equal to 20, there must be indices ( i ) and ( j ) such that ( p_i = p_j = p ). Thus, both sequences ( v_p((x_n + d_i)_n) ) and ( v_p((x_n + d_j)_n) ) tend to (infty). 8. **Contradiction and Conclusion**: If ( v_p((x_n + d_i)_n) ) and ( v_p((x_n + d_j)_n) ) tend to infinity, then eventually ( p^k ) will divide both ( x_n + d_i ) and ( x_n + d_j ) for some sufficiently large ( k ), implying ( p^k mid (d_i - d_j) ). This is a contradiction since ( d_i - d_j ) is a fixed non-zero integer and cannot be divisible by arbitrarily high powers of ( p ). Therefore, our initial assumption must be false. Hence, there exists an integer ( N ) such that for all integers ( x geq N ), (P(x)) is divisible by a prime number greater than 20.

The repair department recorded the number of component A repairs from the 1st to the 20th of a certain month, with the specific data shown in the table below: | Date | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | 10th | |||||||||||| | Number of Component A | 9 | 15 | 12 | 18 | 12 | 18 | 9 | 9 | 24 | 12 | | Date | 11th | 12th | 13th | 14th | 15th | 16th | 17th | 18th | 19th | 20th | |||||||||||| | Number of Component A | 12 | 24 | 15 | 15 | 15 | 12 | 15 | 15 | 15 | 24 | One day is randomly selected from these 20 days, and the random variable X represents the number of component A repairs at the repair department on that day.

(III) Currently, there are two workers in the repair department engaged in maintenance work. To ensure that the mathematical expectation of the number of component A repairs per worker does not exceed 4 per day, how many additional repair workers are needed at least? (Only write down the conclusion).","completion":"(I) To find the distribution table and mathematical expectation of X, we first identify the possible values of X and their probabilities: - X can be 9, 12, 15, 18, or 24. - Counting the occurrences of each value in the given data: - 9 occurs 3 times, - 12 occurs 5 times, - 15 occurs 7 times, - 18 occurs 2 times, - 24 occurs 3 times. Thus, the probabilities are calculated as follows: - P(X=9) = dfrac{3}{20}, - P(X=12) = dfrac{5}{20}, - P(X=15) = dfrac{7}{20}, - P(X=18) = dfrac{2}{20}, - P(X=24) = dfrac{3}{20}.

(II) To find the maximum value of P(aleqslant Xleqslant b) given b-a=6, we consider the possible pairs (a, b): - (9, 15), (12, 18), and (18, 24). Calculating the probabilities for each range: - P(9leqslant Xleqslant 15) = P(X=9) + P(X=12) + P(X=15) = dfrac{3}{20} + dfrac{5}{20} + dfrac{7}{20} = dfrac{15}{20}, - P(12leqslant Xleqslant 18) = P(X=12) + P(X=15) + P(X=18) = dfrac{5}{20} + dfrac{7}{20} + dfrac{2}{20} = dfrac{14}{20}, - P(18leqslant Xleqslant 24) = P(X=18) + P(X=24) = dfrac{2}{20} + dfrac{3}{20} = dfrac{5}{20}. The maximum value of P(aleqslant Xleqslant b) is dfrac{15}{20} = dfrac{3}{4}. Therefore, the maximum value is boxed{dfrac{3}{4}}. (III) To ensure the mathematical expectation of the number of component A repairs per worker does not exceed 4 per day with the current expectation being 15, we calculate the number of workers needed: Given E(X) = 15 and each worker should not exceed 4 repairs per day, we divide the total expected repairs by the maximum repairs per worker: begin{align*} text{Number of workers needed} &= dfrac{E(X)}{4} &= dfrac{15}{4} &= 3.75. end{align*} Since we cannot have a fraction of a worker, we need at least 4 workers in total.

One bag weighs 3 pounds and the other weighs 7 pounds, so together they weigh 3 + 7 = 10 pounds. Since Trace's five shopping bags weigh the same amount as Gordon's two bags, the total weight of Trace's bags is also 10 pounds. To find the weight of one of Trace's bags, we divide the total weight by the number of bags: 10 pounds / 5 bags = 2 pounds per bag. Now, let's find the average weight of Lola's bags. The total weight of Gordon's bags is 10 pounds, so we divide this by 3 to find the average weight that is one pound less than this value: 10 pounds / 3 = 3.33 pounds (repeating). Since Lola's bags weigh one pound less than this average, we subtract 1 pound from 3.33 pounds to get 2.33 pounds. However, since we're dealing with weights, it's unlikely that the bags weigh a fraction of a pound. It's more likely that the question implies the average weight of Lola's bags is a whole number, so we should round 3.33 pounds down to 3 pounds (since 3.33 is closer to 3 than to 4) and then subtract 1 pound to get 2 pounds as the average weight of Lola's bags.

Since the events are independent, we can use the formula for the probability of at least one event happening, P(A cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A cap B), and the complement rule, P(overline{A cup B}) = 1 - P(A cup B), where overline{A cup B} represents neither A nor B happening. 1. For the probability of at least one of them answering correctly, we have: 1 - P(overline{A}overline{B}) = 1 - (1 - p)(1 - q) = frac{5}{6} Rightarrow 1 - (1 - p)(1 - q) = frac{5}{6} Rightarrow (1 - p)(1 - q) = frac{1}{6} 2. For the probability of both answering correctly: P(A cap B) = P(A)P(B) = pq = frac{1}{3} From these, we have the system of equations: left{begin{array}{l} (1 - p)(1 - q) = frac{1}{6} pq = frac{1}{3} end{array}right.

Can it be that 9 of them have 3 friends each (in this class), 11 have 4 friends each, and 10 have 5 friends each?","completion":"1. To solve this problem, we first convert it into a graph theory problem where each person in the class is represented by a vertex, and a friendship between two people is represented by an edge between their corresponding vertices. 2. According to the problem: - 9 people have 3 friends each, so these vertices have degree 3. - 11 people have 4 friends each, so these vertices have degree 4. - 10 people have 5 friends each, so these vertices have degree 5. 3. In graph theory, a fundamental property is that the sum of the degrees of all vertices is twice the number of edges. It implies that all degree sums must be even. 4. Calculate the sum of the degrees: [ text{Sum of degrees} = 9 times 3 + 11 times 4 + 10 times 5 ] [ text{Sum of degrees} = 27 + 44 + 50 = 121 ] 5. Notice that 121 is an odd number. However, according to the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices in any graph must be even because it is equal to twice the edge count (( 2E )). 6. Since the sum of the degrees is 121, which is an odd number, it contradicts the Handshaking Lemma. 7.

Given the conditions (a, b, c, d > 0) and (a + b < c + d), we need to prove that (ac + bd > ab). 2. Start by rewriting the inequality (a + b < c + d): [ a + b < c + d ] This implies: [ a + b - c - d < 0 ] 3. Consider the expression (ac + bd - ab). We need to show that this expression is positive: [ ac + bd - ab > 0 ] 4. Rearrange the terms to isolate (ac + bd): [ ac + bd > ab ] 5. To prove this, let's manipulate the inequality (a + b < c + d) by multiplying both sides by (a) and (b) respectively: [ a(a + b) < a(c + d) ] [ b(a + b) < b(c + d) ] 6. Expanding these inequalities, we get: [ a^2 + ab < ac + ad ] [ ab + b^2 < bc + bd ] 7. Adding these two inequalities together: [ a^2 + ab + ab + b^2 < ac + ad + bc + bd ] Simplifying the left-hand side: [ a^2 + 2ab + b^2 < ac + ad + bc + bd ] 8. Notice that (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) is the expansion of ((a + b)^2): [ (a + b)^2 < ac + ad + bc + bd ] 9. Since (a + b < c + d), we can infer that: [ (a + b)^2 < (c + d)^2 ] 10.

If the edge ((u, w)) is black, then we have a multicolored triangle ((v, u, w)) with one red, one blue, and one black edge, as desired. 8. Now, count the number of such potential multicolored triangles originating from any vertex (v). - Each vertex (v) has (binom{3}{2} times n^2 = 3n^2) ways to form potential multicolored triangles by choosing two out of the three colors in pairs. 9. Thus, the total number of potential multicolored triangles in (K_{3n+1}) is: [ (3n+1) times 3n^2 = 3n^2(3n+1) ] 10. On the other hand, the total number of triangles in (K_{3n+1}) is given by the combination: [ binom{3n+1}{3} = frac{(3n+1)(3n)(3n-1)}{6} = frac{1}{2} n (3n+1)(3n-1) ] 11. Compare the number of multicolored triangles to the total number of triangles: [ 3n^2(3n+1) > frac{1}{2} n (3n+1)(3n-1) ] 12. Simplify the inequality: [ 6n^2(3n+1) > n(3n+1)(3n-1) ] [ 6n^2 > 3n-1 quad text{(since n > 0)} ] Thus, given the discrepancy and the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one triangle among the (binom{3n+1}{3}) that is indeed multicolored. Conclusion: The proof shows that in a 3-colored complete graph (K_{3n+1}), there must be a multicolored triangle.

This is because for a triad {n, n+1, n+2} to become empty, a pianist must leave room n to move to room n-1 (or, equivalently, for a pianist to leave room n+2 to move to room n+3 in symmetric scenario). - During such a move, another pianist from room n+1 would move to room n+2, ensuring that the triad {n, n+1, n+2} remains occupied at all times. 3. **Partitioning the Corridor**: - Divide the infinite corridor into such triads: {n, n+1, n+2} sets. - Within an initially infinite corridor, having a finite number of pianists (9 in this case) implies that there is a finite number of those \\"occupied\\" triads. 4. **Property of Occupied Triads**: - The quantity of these occupied triads cannot exceed 9, thanks to the constraint that there are only 9 pianists. - Once a triad is occupied, it remains filled indefinitely since any movement within a triad will not induce vacancy in it, ensuring that pianists occupy a limited region in the corridor. 5. **Summing Squares of Room Numbers to Show Termination**: - Consider the sum of the squares of the room numbers where pianists reside: [ sum (text{room number}^2) ] - Observe that whenever two pianists in adjacent rooms {k, k+1} move to {k-1, k+2}, the sum of the squares of their positions increases: [ k^2 + (k+1)^2 < (k-1)^2 + (k+2)^2 ] - Here is the detailed inequality breakdown: [ k^2 + (k+1)^2 = k^2 + k^2 + 2k + 1 = 2k^2 + 2k + 1 ] [ (k-1)^2 + (k+2)^2 = (k^2 - 2k + 1) + (k^2 + 4k + 4) = 2k^2 + 2k + 5 ] - Clearly, 2k^2 + 2k + 1 < 2k^2 + 2k + 5, thus validating the inequality. 6. **Conclusion**: - Since each move of pianists strictly increases the sum of the squares of their room numbers, and this process is bounded by the finite number of pianists and corridor rooms, the moves cannot continue indefinitely. - Thus, there must exist a finite point in time after which no more relocations can occur, and the pianists will cease moving.

Therefore, (widehat{FBE} = widehat{GDF}). 3. **Angle Transformation and Parallel Conditions**: According to the problem's condition that (DECG) forms a parallelogram, angles produced by the line segments (DE) and (CG) parallel to each other help form such cyclic properties: [ widehat{FEB} = widehat{FGD} ] 4. **Symmetry concerning axis (AD)**: Since (H) is symmetric to (E) with respect to the line (AD), we conclude: [ widehat{DHF} = widehat{DEF} ] Symmetry implies a reflection across (AD), hence angles subtended on either side of (AD) will be equal in measure. 5. **Supplementary Angle Analysis**: Given ((AD)) is the perpendicular bisector of segment (EH) (due to symmetry), we have the symmetry based conditions resulting in: [ widehat{DHF} = 180^circ - widehat{BEF} ] Furthermore, [ widehat{BEF} = 180^circ - widehat{DGF} ] This leads to the conclusion that: [ widehat{DHF} = 180^circ - widehat{DGF} ] 6. **Conclusion**: Hence, by the cyclic quadrilateral condition (where opposite angles sum to (180^circ)), the points (D, G, H), and (F) lie on the same circle.

The area of a square is the square of its side length. Thus, the combined area S of the two squares can be represented as: S = left(frac{x}{4}right)^2 + left(frac{20-x}{4}right)^2 Expanding and simplifying the formula, we get: S = frac{x^2}{16} + frac{(20 - x)^2}{16} To simplify this further and combine like terms, we have: S = frac{x^2}{16} + frac{400 - 40x + x^2}{16} Combining the terms with x^2 and separating constants: S = frac{2x^2}{16} - frac{40x}{16} + frac{400}{16} This simplifies to: S = frac{1}{8}x^2 - frac{5}{2}x + 25 To find the minimum value of this quadratic function, where S is minimized, we can complete the square or use calculus by finding the derivative and setting it to zero to solve for x.

To show that the minimum is achievable: - For ( q ) odd: Draw a regular ( q )-gon, then draw a line through a vertex and through the opposite side. In the first round, the matches whose corresponding lines are perpendicular to this drawn line will play. Doing this one round for each vertex yields a construction for the lower bound. - For ( q = 2p ): Let ( g(p) ) be the required number of rounds for ( p ) players. Use the first ( g(p) ) rounds to complete ( p )-cliques for each of two halves, then use the next ( p ) rounds to connect each of the players in the first half to the players in the second half (connect ( a_i ) to ( b_{i+j} ) in round ( j ) where indices are taken mod ( p )). If ( p ) is odd, we can eliminate one of these rounds by connecting ( a_i ) to ( b_i ) in each of the first ( g(p) ) rounds. Thus, the lemma follows. 3. **Application of Lemma**: - If ( k ) is odd, we can make ( lceil frac{2n}{k+1} rceil ) cliques of size at most ( k+1 ) and have some extra edges. The most we might possibly be able to choose here is ( lceil frac{2n}{k+1} rceil ) since we can only choose one from each clique, so ( f(n,k) leq lceil frac{2n}{k+1} rceil ). - Similarly for ( k ) even, ( f(n,k) leq lceil frac{2n}{k} rceil ). 4. **Graph Theory Approach**: - Consider the graph ( G ) where the vertices are the players and there is an edge between the vertices if two players were matched. The maximal degree of this graph is at most ( k ). Thus, it can be ( k+1 )-colored, which immediately shows that ( f(n,k) geq lceil frac{2n}{k+1} rceil ) since at least one of the colors contains at least ( lceil frac{2n}{k+1} rceil ) vertices by the pigeonhole principle. Since this is a vertex-coloring, the vertices of this color must form an independent set, so ( f(n,k) geq lceil frac{2n}{k+1} rceil ) for all ( n, k ). This settles the case for ( k ) odd. 5. **For ( k ) even**: - Consider each connected component ( C ). We will split into three cases: 1. **C is an odd cycle**: If ( C ) is an odd cycle, then the chromatic number of ( C ) is ( 3 ). We also know that we cannot make an odd cycle in the case ( k = 2 ), so ( k geq 3 ). Thus, ( chi(C) leq k ). 2. **C is a complete graph**: We know from the lemma that we are unable to make a ( k+1 )-clique using ( k ) rounds, so if ( C = K_m ), then ( m leq k ). Thus, ( chi(C) = m leq k ). 3. **C is neither an odd cycle nor a complete graph**: Then Brooks' Theorem gives that ( chi(C) leq k ), since the maximal degree of ( C ) is at most ( k ). - Thus, we have shown that ( chi(C) leq k ) for any connected component ( C ) of ( G ). Since the chromatic number of ( G ) is simply the maximum of the chromatic numbers of the connected components, we know that ( chi(G) leq k ) as well. It follows that ( G ) can be ( k )-colored and thus ( f(n,k) geq lceil frac{2n}{k} rceil ) for even ( k ). 6. **Conclusion**: - We thus arrive at our result: ( f(n,k) = begin{cases}lceil frac{2n}{k+1} rceil, & k text{ is odd} lceil frac{2n}{k} rceil, & k text{ is even} end{cases} ).

Notice that the elements in set (B) can be grouped into 3 pairs with equal sums: ((a+b, c+d)), ((b+c, d+a)), and ((a+c, b+d)). Thus, the total sum of each pair should be equal to (a+b+c+d). 3.

Chr. bis ca. 2122 v. Chr. regierte. Andere Datierungen gehen von den Jahren 2122 v. Chr. bis 2102 v. Chr. oder 2080 v. Chr. bis 2060 v. Chr. aus., Gudea, der in der neueren Literatur gelegentlich auch als Priesterfürst oder Priesterkönig bezeichnet wird, war der dritte und bedeutendste Ensi der zweiten Dynastie von Lagaš während der Gutäerherrschaft in Sumer und Akkad. Er ist durch mehrere überlieferte Statuen, die überwiegend aus Diorit hergestellt wurden, sowie durch diverse Inschriften auf Zylindern und Kegeln – hier vor allem Bauhymnen – die bekannteste sumerische Persönlichkeit und eine der bekanntesten Personen der Geschichte Mesopotamiens überhaupt., Die Situation in Sumer vor Gudea., Die Situation des südlichen Mesopotamiens, später Babylonien, zur Zeit Gudeas „Sumer und Akkad“, war am Ende des 3. Jahrtausends v. Chr. instabil und von kriegerischen Auseinandersetzungen geprägt., Nach mehreren hundert Jahren eines zumeist kriegerischen Konfliktes zwischen dem Staat von Lagaš und dem Stadtstaat Umma um den Grenzverlauf zwischen beiden Gebieten und um die Nutzung von Wasser und Weideland konnte der Ensi Ummas, Lugal-Zagesi, um 2280 v. Chr. (neuere Literatur nennt eine Zeit um 2425 v. Chr.) den Konflikt zu Ummas Gunsten entscheiden. Sein Sieg war so weitgehend, dass er Girsu und Lagaš zumindest zum Teil zerstören konnte., Etwa 75 Jahre nach diesen für Lagaš katastrophalen Ereignissen wurde die traditionelle Lebensweise der Sumerer stark beeinträchtigt. Es folgte eine Phase der Fremdherrschaften. Erst hatten die aggressiven Nachbarn der Sumerer, die Akkader, für etwa 150 Jahre die Oberhoheit über Sumer inne, danach für etwa 100 Jahre die Gutäer aus dem Zagros-Gebirge im benachbarten iranischen Hochland. Diese hatten zwar die Herrschaft der Akkader beendet, übten jedoch ihrerseits in der Folgezeit die Oberherrschaft über Sumer aus. Städte wie Ur und Uruk waren gezwungen, sich den Gutäern unterzuordnen., Lagaš jedoch scheint eine gewisse Eigenständigkeit bewahrt zu haben, auch wenn die Gutäer zumindest nominell die Oberherrschaft über Lagaš ausübten. Schon unter Gudeas Vorgänger Ur-Baba konnte Lagaš seinen Einfluss wieder auf weite Gebiete Sumers ausdehnen und den Einfluss der Gutäer und der sumerischen Stadtstaaten zurückdrängen., Trotzdem scheint Ur-Baba, wie auch später Gudea, ein gutes Verhältnis zu den Gutäern gehabt zu haben. Die Machtverhältnisse in Sumer waren nach einer langen Epoche von Kriegen ungeklärt, viele Städte waren verwüstet und die Infrastruktur weitgehend zerstört. In dieser prekären Situation kam der Restaurator Gudea an die Macht., Gudeas Herkunft und Legitimation., Über Gudeas Herkunft ist nichts bekannt. Er folgte Ur-Baba auf dem Thron Lagaš nach, dem Vater seiner ersten Frau Ninalla. In Inschriften beschreibt er sich als den, „der keine Mutter hat, der keinen Vater hat“. Dabei dürfte es sich jedoch um eine religiös-politische Aussage mit dem Zweck handeln, seine persönliche Schutzgöttin Nansche zu seiner Mutter zu erheben und sich damit in eine gottähnliche Position zu bringen. Nach seinem Tod bezeichneten drei Schreiber, die während der Regierungszeiten von Šu-Sin und Amar-Suena lebten, Gudea auf Inschriften posthum als „Gott von Lagaš“. Zu Gudeas Lebzeiten ist eine Vergöttlichung dagegen nicht belegt. Während seiner Herrschaft fehlt in zeitgenössischen Dokumenten das Gottesdeterminativ \\"Dingir\\"., Unklar ist, ob er zu seiner zweiten Frau Geme-šulpae eine zweite monogame Beziehung oder ob er mehrere Frauen gleichzeitig hatte, von denen nur eine als „regierende“ Königin fungierte, wie es in der anschließenden Ur-III-Zeit üblich war. Gudea stellte sich selbst als den vom Stadtgott Ningirsu berufenen „Hirten“ für das Land Sumer dar: „\\"...recht(mäßig)e Hirte, der aufgrund des beständigen Wortes (seines Stadtgottes) Ningirsu... ins Innere berufen wurde.\\"“ Gudea ist ferner der erste fassbare Herrscher der Geschichte, der sich als „rechtmäßig“ und „weise“ darstellen lässt, eine Tradition, die bis in die Neuzeit beibehalten wurde. Aus ungeklärten Gründen ist die zweite Dynastie von Lagaš – und damit auch Gudea – nicht auf der sumerischen Königsliste verewigt, obwohl sie offensichtlich von weitaus größerer Bedeutung war als viele andere dort aufgeführte Dynastien., Gudea als Bauherr, Friedens- und Kriegsfürst., In seinen Inschriften beruft sich Gudea darauf, nur den Göttern gefällige Werke getan zu haben. In seiner recht langen und für die ansonsten recht kriegerische Zeit relativ friedvollen Regierungszeit tat sich Gudea vor allem als Bauherr von Tempeln (von denen vor allem der E-ninnu-Tempel, der zentrale Ningirsu-Tempel in Girsu, zu nennen ist) hervor, als Förderer des kultischen Dienstes sowie als Förderer des Handels (Diorit aus Magan (wahrscheinlich heute im Oman), Zedern aus dem Amanosgebirge/Libanon und Platanen vom oberen Euphrat). Überhaupt gab es unter Gudea ein sehr weit verzweigtes Handelsnetz, das bis nach Dilmun (das heute wohl in Bahrain zu suchen ist) reichte. Mit den Gutäern scheint er Handelsabkommen getroffen zu haben, die den Durchzug seiner Karawanen nach Norden und Nordwesten sicherstellten. Möglicherweise erkannte Gudea symbolisch sogar die Oberhoheit der Gutäer über seinen Staat an. In der Praxis scheinen sich beide Reiche jedoch eher ergänzt als beherrscht zu haben., Besondere Bedeutung kommt in Gudeas Regierungszeit dem erwähnten Bauprogramm zu. In vielen Städten ließ er Tempel restaurieren oder neu bauen. Allein in Girsu sollen 15 Tempel entstanden sein. Er ließ Kanäle erneuern und förderte diverse Bauprojekte, um die zum Teil zerstörten Städte und die zerstörte Infrastruktur wieder aufzubauen. So ist es nicht verwunderlich, dass einer seiner Beinamen – in Anlehnung an eine seiner Statuen – „\\"der Architekt mit dem Plan\\"“ lautet. Die Bauhymnen, die zu diesem Anlass verfasst wurden, gehören zu den bedeutendsten Zeugnissen der sumerischen Literatur. Die bekannteste, 1363 Zeilen umfassende Tempelbauhymne auf den beiden „Zylindern von Gudea“, die anlässlich der Erbauung des Eninnu-Tempels verfasst wurde, schildert, wie Enlil Ningirsu ermuntert, sich einen Tempel errichten zu lassen. Dieser erscheint daraufhin Gudea im Schlaf, gibt Gudea den Bauplan und beauftragt ihn, den Tempel zu errichten. Nachdem Gudea seinen Traum wie üblich zunächst deuten ließ, begann er unverzüglich damit, diesen Tempel zu bauen. Die festliche Einweihung mit der Segnung des Tempels, Ningirsus und Gudeas durch Enlil krönte Gudeas nächtliche Eingebung., Auch wenn sich Gudea als Friedensfürst darstellte, kam es unter seiner Regentschaft zu Kriegen, so etwa gegen das in Elam liegende Land Anschan im iranischen Hochland. Nur über diesen Kriegszug liegen uns heute Berichte aus Inschriften vor. Auch hier stellt sich Gudea als gottgefällig dar und berichtet von der Kriegsbeute, die er in Ningirsus Tempel \\"Eninnu\\" gebracht hat. Andere Aktionen, wie das „\\"Öffnen der Wege vom Oberen bis zum Unteren Meer\\"“ – also die Öffnung von Handelswegen vom Mittelmeer zum Persischen Golf – waren wohl kaum ohne Waffengewalt zu bewältigen. Die alten Städte Nippur (religiöser Mittelpunkt Sumers) und Uruk wurden von Lagasch abhängig. Lagaš selbst befand sich unter der Oberhoheit Urs, faktisch jedoch war die Stadt unter Gudea selbstständig., Es spricht einiges dafür, dass auch Ur unter dem Einfluss von Lagaš stand, immerhin setzte er \\"Enanepada\\", eine der Töchter seines Vorgängers und Schwiegervaters Ur-Baba, als Entu-Priesterin ein (es ist wahrscheinlich, dass dies jedoch schon Ur-Baba selbst getan hatte). Wie groß der Einfluss Gudeas war, ist daran ablesbar, dass man seine Statuen nicht nur auf dem Gebiet Lagaschs gefunden hat, sondern auch in Ur, Uruk, Adab und Nippur. Auch zu Eridu scheint Gudea ein gutes Verhältnis gehabt zu haben., \\"Resümierend lässt sich feststellen, dass Gudeas Politik davon geprägt war, eine lockere Oberhoheit über die sumerischen Stadtstaaten auszuüben, ohne dass er dabei versucht hätte, die Städte wirklich aktiv zu regieren, wie es die Könige von Akkad getan hatten. Das hätte auch Gudeas restaurativer Einstellung widersprochen, da diese davon geprägt war, die alte sumerische Ordnung – zu der eben auch die Stadtstaatlichkeit gehörte – wiederherzustellen. Es dürfte sich eher so verhalten haben, dass die Vormachtstellung Lagaš als Handelszentrum, für die Gudea verantwortlich zeichnete, die einigende Klammer Sumers war. Die Handelsbeziehungen, die Lagaš unterhielt, machten den Staat wohlhabend. Erst dadurch konnte Gudea seine Förderung von Wissenschaften, Künsten und den Ausbau der Infrastruktur finanzieren.\\", Gudea als Restaurator sumerischer Traditionen., Wie schon in der frühdynastischen Zeit wurde unter Gudea der Staat Lagaš vor allem vom Dreistädtebund Girsu, Lagaš und Nina-Siraran gebildet. Residenz und Kultzentrum war nicht die namengebende Stadt Lagaš, sondern die Stadt Girsu. Der Ort \\"E-Nim-MAR.KI-Guaba\\" war der Seehafen Lagaš. Insgesamt variierte die Größe des Landes immer wieder. Nach heutigen Schätzungen übte Gudea die Oberherrschaft über ein Gebiet mit 17 Städten, rund 160.000 Hektar Fläche und mehr als 200.000 Einwohnern aus. Der jahrhundertelang ausgetragene Streit zwischen Lagaš und dem Stadtstaat Umma um den Verlauf der Grenze zwischen beiden Staaten, der um 2280 v. Chr. sogar zur Zerstörung Girsus geführt hatte, scheint zur Zeit Gudeas keine Rolle mehr gespielt zu haben., Gudeas Regentschaft stand am Ende der akkadischen Epoche Mesopotamiens. Das vormals mächtige Reich von Akkad war wieder zu einem Stadtstaat geschrumpft. Gudea nutzte die Gelegenheit und versuchte, die alte sumer: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Es handelt sich um einen Komplex, in dem Eisenionen in den Oxidationsstufen +2 und +3 vorliegen und über das Cyanid-Anion ([C≡N]−) verbunden sind. Das wesentliche Strukturelement des Berliner Blaus ist die Sequenz Fe(II)-[C≡N]-Fe(III) in einem dreidimensionalen, polymeren Gerüst., Berliner Blau kommt in einer als „unlöslich“ und einer als „löslich“ bezeichneten Form vor, wobei die Struktur der beiden gleich ist. Die allgemeine Summenformel lautet Mnm+[Fe(III)Fe(II)(CN)6]3 · 15H2O. Es handelt sich um ein kubisch flächenzentriertes Gitter, in dem beim löslichen Berliner Blau Alkali- oder Ammoniumionen die Plätze in den Oktaederlücken des Gitters einnehmen (M = Na, K, NH4; n = 3, m = 1) und der Ladungskompensation des Komplexes dienen. Beim unlöslichen Berliner Blau übernehmen Eisen(III)-Ionen diese Funktion (M = Fe, n = 1, m = 3). Dabei liegen die löslichen Varianten in wässriger Lösung in Form kolloidaler Lösungen vor, es handelt sich nicht um eine echte Löslichkeit unter Dissoziation der Verbindung., Der Berliner Farbenhersteller Johann Jacob Diesbach stellte um 1706 erstmals Berliner Blau her. Es erlangte sofort kommerzielle Bedeutung als Pigment für die Ölmalerei und die Färbung von Stoffen. Durch die Veröffentlichung der Rezeptur im Jahr 1724 nahmen mehrere Firmen die Herstellung von Berliner Blau unter vielen weiteren Namen auf., Berliner Blau gilt als die erste synthetische Koordinationsverbindung. Seine tiefblaue Farbe verdankt es Metall-Metall-Charge-Transfer-Übergängen, die im gelb-roten Bereich Strahlung absorbieren und das blaue Licht als Komplementärfarbe reflektieren., Die Namen \\"Blausäure\\" und \\"Cyanid\\" (von „dunkelblau“) leiten sich von der Farbe des Berliner Blaus ab. Die Bezeichnung \\"Prussiate\\", bei denen ein Cyanidoligand im Komplex durch einen anderen Liganden ersetzt ist, etwa Nitroprussid, leitet sich von der Bezeichnung \\"Preußischblau\\" ab. Berliner Blau ist der Namensgeber für die sogenannten Berliner-Blau-Analoga, eine Klasse mikroporöser anorganischer Feststoffe mit einer breiten Palette von katalytischen, elektronischen, optischen und magnetischen Eigenschaften. Auch über dreihundert Jahre nach der Erstsynthese ist Berliner Blau ein Forschungsobjekt, über das in jedem Jahr viele wissenschaftliche Artikel veröffentlicht werden., Aufgrund seiner einfachen Herstellung aus einer Lösung von Eisen(III)-Salz und gelbem Blutlaugensalz wird es vorwiegend als preiswertes Farbmittel verwendet. Berliner Blau ist praktisch ungiftig und wird als Gegenmittel bei Vergiftungen mit radioaktivem Caesium oder Thallium eingesetzt. Die Therapie nutzt die Ionenaustauscheigenschaften und die hohe Affinität der Verbindung für bestimmte Metallkationen. Es steht auf der Liste der unentbehrlichen Arzneimittel der Weltgesundheitsorganisation, die in einem Gesundheitssystem benötigt werden., Nomenklatur., Berliner Blau wurde unter vielfältigen Bezeichnungen angeboten. Die Bezeichnungen nehmen Bezug auf die Namen der Erfinder oder Hersteller, die Herstellungsorte, die Farbnuancen, die Anwendungen oder die chemischen Komponenten und Verfahren. Die Varianten können sich im Farbstich unterscheiden. Alle Namen bezeichnen blaue Pigmente auf Basis des Fe(II)/Fe(III)-Cyanidokomplexes und unterscheiden sich in ihrer Zusammensetzung nur unwesentlich. Die Art und Menge der verwendeten Alkalimetall- oder Ammoniumionen beeinflusst die Hervorbringung bestimmter Farbnuancen. Historisch wurde das Pigment als Blausalz in den Handel gebracht. Im Colour Index wird Berliner Blau als C.I. Pigment Blue 27 nach der Farbe und nach der Struktur als C. I. 77510 für kaliumdotiertes Eisenblau beziehungsweise C.I. 77520 für das Ammonium-Natrium-Eisenblau geführt., Diesbachblau ist nach dem Namen des eigentlichen Erfinders benannt. Turnbulls Blau wurde 1828 durch John Turnbull jr. entwickelt und über die schottische Firma Turnbull &amp; Ramsay in Glasgow vertrieben. Es handelt sich bei Turnbulls Blau um ein aus rotem Blutlaugensalz mit überschüssigen Eisen(II)-Ionen gebildetes Blaupigment. Die Gewinnung erfolgt durch das Umsetzen von Eisen(II)-Salzen mit Kaliumhexacyanidoferrat(III) in wässriger Lösung. Zunächst wurde angenommen, dass der sich bildende dunkelblaue Niederschlag eine andere Zusammensetzung als das durch Umsetzen von Eisen(III)-Salzen mit Kaliumhexacyanidoferrat(II) (gelbes Blutlaugensalz) gewonnene Berliner Blau aufwies. Mittels EPR- und Mößbauerspektroskopie konnte jedoch festgestellt werden, dass die Reaktionsprodukte weitgehend identisch sind, da folgendes Gleichgewicht besteht:, Miloriblau bezeichnet gekochte Sorten des Pigments, die einen etwas wärmeren rotstichigen Farbton aufweisen und erstmals von der Firma Milori de France hergestellt wurden. Diese hatte nach Diesbach ein Blaupigment auf einem anderen Verfahrensweg gewonnen, das im Vergleich zum Preußischblau etwas schwächer in seiner Farbstärke ist. Der Name Miloriblau hat sich bis heute erhalten. Vossenblau wurde nach der L. Vossen &amp; Co G.m.b.H. bei Düsseldorf benannt, die ab 1905 exklusiv den Vertrieb durchführte., Französischblau oder Pariser Blau bezieht sich auf den Firmensitz der Firma A. Milori. Preußisch Blau, auch Preußischblau, sowie Zwickauer Blau beziehen sich ebenfalls auf Produktionsstandorte., Der Name Bronzeblau bezieht sich auf den bronzierenden roten Farbstich, der sich bei verschiedenen Bindemitteln zeigt. Insbesondere bezieht sich Bronzeblau auf den rötlichen Glanz der ungemahlenen, schwarzblauen Brocken., Chinesisch Blau oder Chinablau hat seinen Namen von dekorativem Porzellan. Diese Produktionsvariante des Pigmentes ergibt die reinsten und brillantesten Farbtöne mit einem Grünstich. Es ergibt den besten Vollton und die höchste Deckkraft, allerdings hat es die härteste Struktur und den höchsten Ölbedarf. Sächsischblau bezieht sich auf die Farbe der Uniformen der sächsischen Armee, die mit Berliner Blau gefärbt wurden. Tonerblau oder Tintenblau bekam diesen Namen wegen der Nutzung zum Abtönen des rötlichen (braunen) Farbstichs von Ruß., Aus der Struktur beziehungsweise Zusammensetzung des Pigments leiten sich die Namen Eisenblau, Eisencyanblau, Eisenhexacyanidoferrat, Stahlblau, Eisencyanürcyanid, Ferrozyanblau und Ferriferrocyanidblau sowie Stahlblau ab. Pottascheblau bezieht sich auf die Verwendung von Pottasche bei der Herstellung. Bis zum Ersten Weltkrieg war das Kation des Komplexsalzes vorwiegend Kalium. Als zu Beginn des 20.Jahrhunderts der Preis von Pottasche stark anstieg, wurde das Ammoniumsalz mit gleich guten Eigenschaften hergestellt. Eisenblau bezeichnet auch ein altertümliches Pigment aus dem Mineral Vivianit., Luisenblau, Modeblau, Wasserblau sind Produktnamen für abgewandelte Farbmittel in der Textilfärberei und mögen als Namen für Modefarben entstanden sein. Das rotstichigste Pigment ist Miloriblau, die grünstichigste Variante ist das Chinesisch Blau., Im französischen Sprachraum sind die Bezeichnungen \\"Bleu de prusse\\" oder \\"Bleu de Milori\\" geläufig, im englischen Sprachraum die Bezeichnungen \\"iron blue\\", \\"toning blue\\" oder \\"Prussian blue\\"., Geschichte., Erste Synthesen., Wahrscheinlich um 1706 stellte Johann Jacob Diesbach, ein Berliner Farbenhersteller, erstmals Berliner Blau her. Die früheste bekannte schriftliche Nennung des Pigments erfolgt in einem Brief vom 31.März 1708, von Johann Leonhard Frisch an Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, den Präsidenten der Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. Im August 1709 benannte er das Pigment als \\"Preußisch blau\\", im November desselben Jahres änderte er die Bezeichnung in \\"Berlinisch Blau\\". Frisch war verantwortlich für die frühe Vermarktung des Pigments. Er behauptete von sich, das Pigment durch eine Säurebehandlung verbessert zu haben. Frisch ist der Verfasser der ersten Publikation zum Berliner Blau in \\"Notitia Coerulei Berolinensis nuper inventi\\" von 1710. Diesbach stand etwa ab 1701 in Frischs Diensten., Neben Diesbach wird Johann Konrad Dippel mit der Erfindung in Verbindung gebracht. Wie verlässlich die entsprechende Angabe durch Georg Ernst Stahl und die damit verbundene Geschichte der ersten zufälligen Herstellung des Pigments ist, kann heute schlecht beurteilt werden. Demnach war Diesbach mit der Herstellung eines roten Farbstoffs beschäftigt, als ihm die Pottasche (Kaliumcarbonat) zur Ausfällung des Farbstoffs ausging. Von seinem Kollegen Johann Konrad Dippel ließ er sich deshalb einen Ersatzstoff geben (verunreinigt mit „Dippels Tieröl“), der jedoch entgegen seinen Erwartungen ein blaues Pigment ausfällte. Das Rezept konnte einige Zeit geheim gehalten werden, bis es schließlich der Engländer John Woodward 1724 in den \\"Philosophical Transactions\\" veröffentlichte. Die Informationen dazu hatte er vom Berliner Apotheker Caspar Neumann., Verwendung in der Malerei und Textilfärbung., Berliner Blau diente anfangs als Pigment für Kunstmaler, die damit das relativ teure Ultramarin aus Lapislazuli ersetzten. Das 1709 durch Pieter van der Werff in Rotterdam geschaffene Gemälde „Die Grablegung Christi“ (Bildergalerie Sanssouci, Potsdam) stellt den frühesten bisher bekannten Nachweis der Verwendung des Pigments in der Malerei dar. Um 1710 wurde es von Malern am Preußischen Hof vielfach genutzt und erreichte Paris, wo es durch Antoine Watteau und später von seinen Nachfolgern Nicolas Lancret und Jean-Baptiste Pater verwendet wurde., Ein von Pierre-Joseph Macquer entwickeltes Färbeverfahren, wobei das Berliner Blau mittels Gelben Blutlaugensalzes direkt auf der Woll-, Baumwoll- oder Seidenfaser abgeschieden wurde, verbesserte die Farbechtheit erheblich und führte ab den 1760er Jahren zu einem Aufschwung der Berliner-Blau-Produktion. Die Erfindung verschaffte Macquer die Berufung zum Generalinspektor der Färbereien. Die erhöhte Nachfrage führte zwischen 1756 und 1799 zur Gründung von elf Berliner-Blau-Fabriken in Deutschland. Die Fabriken deckten ihren Energiebedarf und die Versorgung mit Pottasche weitgehend durch die Verbrennung von Holz. Die Verarbeitung von tierischen Abfällen ging mit einer Geruchsbelästigung einher, die einen gewissen Abstand zur Wohnbebauung erforderte. Daher lagen diese Fabriken oft in der Nähe von Wäldern. Damit begann Mitte des 18.Jahrhunderts die anorganisch-chemische Produktion in Deutschland. Die industrielle Produktion von Berliner Blau beschrieb Theodor Fontane in seinem Roman \\": Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"ATC-V03, Anorganisches Pigment, Antidot, Arzneistoff, Cyanidokomplex, Eisenverbindung, Farbname, Berliner Blau, Pigment Blue 27, C.I. 77510"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Discovery (Raumfähre), Japanische Raumfahrt, NASA, Raumfahrtmission 2005], STS-114 (englisch Space Transportation System) ist die Missionsbezeichnung für einen Flug des US-amerikanischen Space Shuttle Discovery (OV-103). Der Start erfolgte am 26. Juli 2005. Es war die 114. Space-Shuttle-Mission, der 31. Flug der Raumfähre Discovery und der 17. Flug eines Shuttles zur Internationalen Raumstation (ISS)., Die Mission stand unter dem Motto „Return to Flight“ (Rückkehr zum Flug) und war der erste Space-Shuttle-Flug nach dem Unglück der Columbia im Februar 2003 (Flug STS-107)., Mannschaft., Kelly und Thomas waren bereits bei STS-102 gemeinsam im All gewesen., Die Rolle der Verbindungssprecher (CapComs) übernahmen Shannon Lucid, der u.a. die Übermittlung der Wake-Up-Calls oblag, Kenneth Ham und Julie Payette. Flugdirektor war LeRoy Cain., Missionsverlauf., Zu den Aufgaben der Mission gehörte der Transport von Gütern mit dem von Alenia Spazio in Italien gebauten Logistikmodul Raffaello zur Internationalen Raumstation. Insgesamt wurden in dem Modul etwa 8,3t Fracht ausgeliefert. Zudem sollte bei den drei geplanten Weltraumausstiegen ein neues Gyroskop, als Ersatz für das defekte CMG-1-Gerät der Station, am Z1-Modul installiert, eine weitere externe Stauplattform für Ersatzteile External Stowage Platform-2 (ESP-2) an der Luftschleuse Quest montiert sowie Methoden der Reparatur des Hitzeschildes der Raumfähre erprobt werden., Ein weiterer Bestandteil der Mission war ein Test des nach dem Columbia-Unglück umgebauten Außentanks. Sowohl am Orbiter als auch am Außentank wurden Kameras angebracht, um sich eventuell ablösende Teile zu entdecken. Zusätzlich wurde der Start sowohl vom Boden als auch von Flugzeugen der US Air Force aus gefilmt. Außerdem wurde die neue Verlängerung des Roboterarmes, das Orbital Boom Sensor System (OBSS), mit dessen Hilfe der Hitzeschild der Raumfähre im Orbit auf möglicherweise beim Start entstandene Schäden untersucht werden sollte, einem Test unterzogen. Das OBSS verfügt über einen Laser-Entfernungsmesser (LDRI) und ein Laser-Kamerasystem (LCS). Die Sensoren haben eine Auflösung von einigen Millimetern und können mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 6,3cm/s abtasten., Start, 26. Juli 2005., Nach einigen Verschiebungen sollte die STS-114-Mission am 13. Juli 2005 beginnen, jedoch wurde der Countdown aufgrund eines technischen Problems etwa zwei Stunden vor dem geplanten Start abgebrochen. Als Ursache nannte die NASA einen fehlerhaften Treibstoffsensor., Bei dem fraglichen Sensor handelt es sich um einen von vier im Wasserstoffbehälter des Außentanks eingebauten ECO-Niedrigfüllstandsensoren (Engine Cut-Off). Diese sorgen bei Treibstoffmangel dafür, dass die drei Haupttriebwerke des Orbiters abgeschaltet werden. Damit wird ein Entleeren der Wasserstoff- und Sauerstoffleitungen verhindert, da sonst die Turbopumpen leerlaufen, durchdrehen und explodieren können, was den Orbiter schwer beschädigen könnte., Während der bisherigen Shuttle-Missionen kam das ECO-System zweimal zum Einsatz: Bei STS-51-F schaltete ein Triebwerk nach etwa sechs Minuten wegen einer fälschlicherweise gemeldeten Überhitzung ab. Die beiden übrigen Triebwerke liefen mit erhöhter Leistung weiter, aufgrund des reduzierten Gesamtschubs bzw. der verlängerten Brenndauer konnte jedoch nur ein niedrigerer Orbit als geplant erreicht werden. Bei der Mission STS-93 (ebenfalls unter dem Kommando von Eileen Collins) hatte ein Leck in einem der Triebwerke zu einem zu hohen Sauerstoffverbrauch geführt, was die ECO-Sensoren die Haupttriebwerke drei Sekunden zu früh abschalten ließ., Die Verkabelung der ECO-Sensoren endet im Heck des Orbiters in einem „Punktsensorbox“ (Point Sensor Box) genannten Mikrocontroller. Bei einem Betankungstest im April 2005 funktionierten zwei ECO-Sensoren nicht zuverlässig. Zur Ursachenermittlung wurde die Sensorbox der Discovery ausgebaut und durch die Box des Shuttles Atlantis ersetzt. In den folgenden Tests stellte sich die Box der Discovery als voll funktionsfähig heraus. Bei weiteren Tests versagte dann allerdings die Atlantis-Box. Sie wurde durch die aus der Endeavour ausgebaute Punktsensorbox ersetzt. Zwischenzeitlich wurde die Entscheidung getroffen, den eigentlich vorgesehenen Außentank der Discovery und damit die unzuverlässigen ECO-Sensoren am Boden zu lassen und den für STS-121 vorgesehenen, nochmals verbesserten Tank zu benutzen. Der Vorgang ging zunächst als „unerklärliche Anomalie“ in die Akten ein., Während des Countdowns am 13. Juli sprang der Wasserstoff-ECO-Sensor Nr. 2 bei einer Simulation nicht korrekt von „nass“ auf „trocken“ um. In den folgenden Tagen arbeiteten die Ingenieure rund um die Uhr, um das Problem einzugrenzen und zu beheben. Man vertauschte für den nächsten Start zu Testzwecken die Verkabelung von Sensor 2 und 3 und behob ein mögliches Problem mit der Erdung, denn elektrostatische Aufladung hätte den Sensor dazu bringen können, falsch anzuzeigen. Eine konkrete Ursache konnte allerdings nicht festgestellt werden. Am 21. Juli 2005 bestätigte dann die NASA, dass am 26. Juli ein weiterer Startversuch stattfinden solle., Am 26. Juli 2005 startete die Discovery planmäßig und ohne Verzögerungen um 14:39 UTC. Die Treibstoffsensoren funktionierten problemlos. Am Tag darauf gab die NASA nach Auswertung der Bilder vom Shuttle-Start bekannt, dass sich erneut ein großes Stück Isolierschaum vom Außentank gelöst und man bis zur Klärung der Ursachen alle weiteren Space-Shuttle-Flüge ausgesetzt habe. Somit war auch der folgende Flug mit der Raumfähre Atlantis, mit dem der deutsche Astronaut Thomas Reiter am 9. September 2005 zur Internationalen Raumstation fliegen sollte, sowie der weitere ISS-Ausbau generell gestoppt., 1. Flugtag, 26. Juli 2005., Nach dem Start der Raumfähre am 26. Juli und dem Erreichen der Umlaufbahn wurden die Ladebuchttore geöffnet, das Laptop-Netzwerk des Shuttles und der Roboterarm in Betrieb genommen sowie die Systeme des Shuttles überprüft., 2. Flugtag, 27. Juli 2005., Am zweiten Flugtag (27. Juli) wurde der Hitzeschild der Discovery auf eventuelle Schäden untersucht, die beim Start durch sich vom Außentank ablösende Isolierschaumstücke entstanden sein könnten. Dabei wurde erstmals der neue OBSS-Inspektionsarm eingesetzt, der nach dem Columbia-Unglück entwickelt wurde., Der OBSS ist ein 15 Meter langer „Aufsatz“, der mit dem Roboterarm des Shuttles verbunden wird. Der Kopf des OBSS ist mit Laser-Sensoren und hoch auflösenden Kameras ausgestattet und tastet halbautomatisch die Hitzeschutzkacheln des Orbiters ab., Gegen 9:30 UTC aktivierte Andrew Thomas den RMS, montierte den OBSS und begann eine halbe Stunde später mit der Kachelinspektion. Zusammen mit James Kelly und Charles Camarda wurde den gesamten Tag der empfindliche Hitzeschild auf Beschädigungen untersucht. Nachdem erste Sichtungen keine Auffälligkeiten ergaben, wurden die Aufnahmen anschließend von den Technikern in Houston eingehenden Analysen unterzogen., 3. Flugtag, 28. Juli 2005., Am 28. Juli näherte sich die Discovery der ISS. In der Nähe der Station führte Eileen Collins ein spektakuläres 360°-Manöver durch, wobei sie die Raumfähre innerhalb weniger Minuten um ihre Querachse drehen ließ. Die Besatzung der Station fertigte währenddessen hochauflösende Aufnahmen des Shuttle-Hitzeschildes an. Auf den später zur Erde übertragenen Bildern wurden mehrere geringfügige Beschädigungen der Schutzkacheln festgestellt. Die NASA sah jedoch keinen Grund zur Beunruhigung, da dies bei Starts von Space Shuttles üblich sei. Auch die Zahl der Beschädigungen sei deutlich geringer als bei früheren Missionen, wie der stellvertretende Leiter des Shuttle-Programms, Wayne Hale, erklärte., Um 11:18 UTC dockte das Shuttle am Pressurized Mating Adapter 2 der Station an. Um 12:50 UTC wurden die Luken geöffnet. Dabei hielt die Langzeitbesatzung der Raumstation, bestehend aus Sergei Krikaljow und John Phillips, an der ISS-Tradition fest, dass jeder einzelne Neuankömmling mit einem zweifachen Schlag einer Schiffsglocke im Destiny-Labormodul begrüßt wird., 4. Flugtag, 29. Juli 2005., Am 29. Juli wurde das Logistikmodul Raffaello mit dem Roboterarm der ISS aus der Ladebucht des Shuttles gehievt und am Unity-Verbindungsmodul angedockt. Nach der Öffnung der Luken wurden die sich im Modul befindlichen Frachten zur Station gebracht sowie der Shuttle mit den Gütern beladen, welche zur Erde zurückkehren sollten. Ferner wurde die Unterseite des Shuttlerumpfes mit dem OBSS-System auf weitere Beschädigungen untersucht., 5. Flugtag, 30. Juli 2005., Am 30. Juli stand der erste Weltraumausstieg (EVA) auf dem Plan. Um 9:46 UTC schalteten Soichi Noguchi und Steve Robinson ihre Raumanzüge auf interne Energieversorgung um, was den Beginn des Ausstiegs markierte. Sie verließen die Discovery durch die Luke in der Ladebucht des Shuttles, gleichzeitig wurde die Ausstiegsluke des Moduls Quest von der ISS-Besatzung geöffnet, um den außen arbeitenden Astronauten als Ersatzzuflucht zu dienen. Zunächst testeten die Astronauten neue Methoden zur Reparatur des Raumfähren-Hitzeschildes. Dazu arbeiteten sie in der Ladebucht der Discovery an Proben präparierter Hitzeschutzkacheln. Später installierten die Astronauten eine ESPAD-Halterung (ESP Attachment Device) für eine neue, externe ESP-Stauplattform (External Stowage Platform) an der Luftschleuse Quest, ersetzten eine GPS-Antenne am Z1-Modul, legten ein neues Stromkabel zum Gyroskop Nr. 2 (CMG-2) und führten vorbereitende Arbeiten zum Austausch von CMG-1 durch. Außerdem fertigte Noguchi auf Bitten der Flugkontrolle Fotos vom Shuttle-Cockpit an, wo sich an der Backbordseite etwas Isolationsmaterial gelöst hatte. Alle geplanten Aufgaben wurden erledigt. Die EVA endete um 16:36 UTC nach 6 Stunden und 50 Minuten., Zudem wurde entschieden, die Mission um einen Tag zu verlängern, um den Astronauten mehr Zeit beim Transport zusätzlicher Frachten zu geben. Diese wurden dem Space Shuttle selbst entnommen und beinhalteten beispielsweise Laptops und zusätzliches Wasser., 6. Flugtag, 31. Juli 2005., Am sechsten Missionstag war die Besatzung hauptsächlich mit dem Logistiktransport vom \\"Raffaello\\"-Modul zur Station beschäftigt, auch antworteten sie auf Fragen einiger amerikanischer Fernsehsender im Rahmen einer Pressekonferenz. Zudem wurde an diesem Tag erstmals erwogen, beim dritten Außenbordeinsatz am 3. August eine „Reparatur“ an zwei Stellen des Hitzeschildes der Discovery vorzunehmen, an welchen das Füllmaterial zwischen den Hitzekacheln etwas nach außen trat. Dies war im Gegensatz zu beschädigten Hitzekacheln nicht durch herabfallende Isolierschaumteile des externen Tanks, sondern durch Vibrationen beim Start der Raumfähre entstanden. Die heraustretenden Füllstreifen hätten beim Wiedereintritt der Raumfäh: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Discovery (Raumfähre), Japanische Raumfahrt, NASA, Raumfahrtmission 2005, STS-114, Rückkehr zum Flug, Mannschaft, Verbindungssprecher, Logistikmodul Raffaello, Hitzeschild-Reparatur, Außentank"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Aufgelöst 1920, Ehemaliges Verkehrsunternehmen (Berlin), Gegründet 1899, Siemens-Unternehmen, Straßenbahn Berlin, Straßenbahnbetrieb (Deutschland)], Die Berliner Elektrische Straßenbahnen Aktien-Gesellschaft (kurz: BESTAG) war ein zwischen 1899 und 1920 bestehender Betreiber von elektrischen Straßenbahnen, der aus den von Siemens&amp;Halske betriebenen \\"Elektrischen Straßenbahnen in Berlin\\" hervorging. Im Volksmund wurde sie daher als \\"Siemensbahn\\" bezeichnet.&lt;ref name=\\"BVB 10/65\\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Die 1895 von Siemens&amp; Halske eröffnete Straßenbahnstrecke zwischen Gesundbrunnen und Pankow war die erste elektrische Straßenbahn auf dem damaligen Gebiet Berlins. 1896 wurde eine zweite Strecke von der Friedrichstadt zum Gelände der Berliner Gewerbeausstellung im Treptower Park eröffnet. Bis 1916 kamen weitere Strecken nach Französisch-Buchholz und Rosenthal sowie die Verbindung von Pankower und Treptower Teilnetz durch den Lindentunnel hinzu. 1919 wandelte die Stadt Berlin, in deren mehrheitlichem Besitz sich die Aktien der Gesellschaft befanden, das Unternehmen in einen Kommunalbetrieb um; im Dezember 1920 folgte die Fusion mit der Großen Berliner Straßenbahn (GBS) und den Städtischen Straßenbahnen (SSB) zur Berliner Straßenbahn (BSt). Die von Pankow ausgehenden Strecken nach Buchholz und Rosenthal sind nach wie vor Bestandteil des Berliner Straßenbahnnetzes, die übrigen von der BESTAG erbauten und betriebenen Strecken hingegen stillgelegt., Geschichte., Anfänge., Anfang der 1890er Jahre bekundete die Landgemeinde Pankow, die seit 1874 über eine Pferdebahn der Großen Berliner Pferde-Eisenbahn (ab 1898: Große Berliner Straßenbahn [GBS]) mit Berlin verbunden war, ihr Interesse an einer Pferdebahnverbindung nach Gesundbrunnen. Ein Angebot des Unternehmens Siemens&amp;Halske sah eine elektrische Bahn vor. Es kam daraufhin im April 1893 zum Vertragsabschluss zwischen beiden Seiten. Die Stadt Berlin stimmte dem Bau nach erstem Zögern im Mai 1894 zu. Während zu dieser Zeit bereits der Bau auf Pankower Seite begann, bestanden auf Berliner Seite immer noch Widerstände gegen die Errichtung der Oberleitungen; die erforderliche Zustimmung des Polizeipräsidenten wurde hierfür erst am 19.März 1895 erteilt und galt für 50Jahre. Die Eröffnung dieser ersten elektrischen Berliner Straßenbahnlinie von der Kreuzung Prinzenallee Ecke Badstraße nach Pankow war am 10.September 1895. Die 3,35Kilometer lange Strecke, von der 900Meter in Berlin lagen, war weitgehend zweigleisig und führte von Gesundbrunnen aus über die Prinzenallee, Wollankstraße, Breite Straße und Damerowstraße zur Ecke Mendelstraße. Die Rückfahrt erfolgte wegen der engen Straßen von der Breiten Straße aus über die Spandauer Straße (heute Wilhelm-Kuhr-Straße) und Kreuzstraße zur Wollankstraße. Die Wagenfolge lag bei zehn Minuten. Zum Einsatz kamen an Werktagen Zahlkästen, sonntags wurde das Fahrgeld von Schaffnern erhoben. Den Fahrstrom bezogen die Fahrzeuge über einen Bügelstromabnehmer aus der Oberleitung – eine Technik, die der Siemens-Ingenieur Walter Reichel 1887 entwickelt hatte.&lt;ref name=\\"BVB 4-5/81\\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Die GBS verwendete bei der Elektrifizierung ihres Streckennetzes hingegen Rollenstromabnehmer.&lt;ref name=\\"VB 1/03\\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, Die zweite Strecke entstand unabhängig zur Pankower Linie anlässlich der Gewerbeausstellung im Treptower Park, die Konzession wurde hierfür am 23.April 1896 erteilt. Bereits eine Woche zuvor ging der erste Abschnitt vom Görlitzer Bahnhof über Wiener Straße, Wiener Brücke, Lohmühlenstraße, Am Schlesischen Busch, Köpenicker Landstraße (heute Am Treptower Park) und Bulgarische Straße bis zur Ecke Neue Krugallee in Treptow in Betrieb. Die ursprünglich anvisierte Streckenführung über die Ritterstraße und Reichenberger Straße konnte nicht verwirklicht werden, da die GBS dort ebenfalls die Anlage einer elektrischen Bahn verwirklichte. Einen Monat später folgte die Verlängerung über Grünauer Straße (heute Ohlauer Straße), Kottbusser Ufer (heute Paul-Lincke-Ufer), Britzer Straße (heute Kohlfurter Straße), Wassertorplatz, Wassertorstraße, Alexandrinenstraße zur Hollmannstraße (heute nicht mehr vorhanden). Der darauf folgende Abschnitt bis zur geplanten Endstelle in der Behrenstraße musste aus ästhetischen Gründen mit einer Unterleitung versehen werden. Er wurde in zwei Etappen eröffnet. Zunächst ging es ab dem 13.Juli 1896 von der Hollmannstraße über die Lindenstraße, Markgrafenstraße, Schützenstraße zur Mauerstraße Ecke Leipziger Straße. Die weitere Strecke entlang der Mauerstraße und Behrenstraße vor bis zur Ecke Wilhelmstraße folgte mit Einführung des Winterfahrplans am 3.Oktober 1896. Die Wagen fuhren zunächst im Abstand von sechs Minuten, sonntags alle drei Minuten. Im Oktober 1896 wurde der Abstand von der Behrenstraße zum Görlitzer Bahnhof auf fünf Minuten geändert, zwischen Görlitzer Bahnhof und Treptow auf 15Minuten., Zur Erhöhung der Wirtschaftlichkeit der Pankower Linie bemühte sich Siemens&amp;Halske um eine Verlängerung in die Berliner Innenstadt. Die Konzession für die Verlängerung der Strecke bis zur Kreuzung Mittelstraße Ecke Friedrichstraße wurde am 12.April 1898 erteilt. Da die größeren Ausfallstraßen bereits von den Linien der Großen Berliner Straßenbahn bedient wurden, schlängelte sich die neue Strecke durch mehrere Nebenstraßen bis zum Endpunkt in der Dorotheenstadt. Von der Prinzenallee ging es über die Bellermannstraße, Grüntaler Straße, Badstraße, Hochstraße, Wiesenstraße, Hussitenstraße, Feldstraße, Gartenstraße, Elsässer Straße (heute Torstraße), Artilleriestraße (heute Tucholskystraße), Ebertbrücke, Prinz-Friedrich-Karl-Straße (heute Geschwister-Scholl-Straße), Georgenstraße, Prinz-Louis-Ferdinand-Straße (heute Planckstraße) und Charlottenstraße zur Mittelstraße. Die Inbetriebnahme erfolgte in drei Etappen. Am 20.Mai 1899 ging es bis zur Gartenstraße Ecke Elsässer Straße, am 21.Oktober 1899 bis zur Georgenstraße Ecke Prinz-Louis-Ferdinand-Straße und am 16.Dezember 1899 schließlich bis zur Mittelstraße Ecke Friedrichstraße. Der kurze Abschnitt zur Prinzenallee wurde bis zum 22.März 1902 von einer zweiten Linie und danach durch einen Pendelwagen bedient., Gründung der BESTAG und Netzausbau., Die \\"Berliner Elektrische Straßenbahnen AG\\" wurde am 1.Juli 1899 gegründet, die beiden Linien gingen am 31.Juli 1899 in ihren Besitz über. Die Konzessionsübertragung erfolgte zum 20.Juni 1900. Die Übernahme der bereits betriebenen Strecken wurde rückwirkend zum 1.Juli 1899 festgelegt; die noch zu eröffnenden Strecken sollten zum Zeitpunkt der Betriebseröffnung in das Eigentum der BESTAG übergehen. Siemens&amp;Halske selbst blieb noch bis 1911 Betriebsführer der beiden Linien., Im April 1900 wurde die Wagenfolge zwischen Behrenstraße und Wiener Brücke sowie zwischen Mittelstraße und Pankow, Kirche auf fünf Minuten verdichtet. Die darüber hinaus nach Treptow, Rathaus beziehungsweise Damerowstraße fahrenden Wagen verkehrten im Abstand von zehn Minuten. Zwischen 1902 und 1905 wurde die Wagenfolge zwischen Görlitzer Bahnhof und Treptow zeitweise auf 20Minuten ausgedehnt., 1901 erwarb die Stadt Berlin den größten Teil des Aktienkapitals von sechs Millionen Mark und war ab 1903 schließlich alleiniger Eigentümer der Gesellschaft. Die BESTAG war damit de facto zu einem kommunalen Straßenbahnbetrieb geworden. Mit dem Ankauf wollte die Stadt einer Übernahme durch die GBS zuvorkommen, die dadurch ihre Vorrangstellung hätte weiter ausbauen können. Im gleichen Jahr stellte sie den Streckenabschnitt zwischen Behrenstraße und Hollmannstraße auf Oberleitungsbetrieb um., Ab 1905 ging der Ausbau in beiden Teilnetzen weiter. Den Anfang bildet die Inbetriebnahme einer Strecke von Pankow aus über die Schönholzer Straße und Lindenstraße (heute Grabbeallee) zum Bismarckplatz (heute Pastor-Niemöller-Platz) in Niederschönhausen am 8.Mai 1905. Die bisher an der Pankower Kirche endenden Wagen fuhren nun über die Neubaustrecke. Zwei Tage später ging eine Anschlussstrecke vom Bismarckplatz zur Kreuzung Kaiserweg (heute Friedrich-Engels-Straße) Ecke Platanenweg in Betrieb, die von jedem zweiten Wagen der Linie, also im 20-Minuten-Takt angefahren wurde., Die Endstelle in der Behrenstraße wurde am 15.März 1906 aufgegeben und in die Mauerstraße zurückversetzt. Die Wagen wendeten nun über eine Blockumfahrung, die von der Mauerstraße durch die Kanonierstraße (heute Glinkastraße) und Behrenstraße zurück zur Mauerstraße führte., Am 22.Juli 1907 schloss die Gesellschaft einen Vertrag mit der Gemeinde Französisch-Buchholz zur Übernahme der gemeindeeigenen Pferdebahn ab. Der Vertrag beinhaltet neben der Übernahme der Strecke und der Betriebsrechte die Zusage zur Elektrifizierung der 3,3Kilometer langen Bahn sowie zum Bau einer Verbindungsstrecke entlang der Damerowstraße zum Streckenanfang am Bahnhof Pankow-Heinersdorf. Die Fertigstellung erfolgte am 19.Dezember 1907. Die neu eingerichtete Linie verkehrte im Abstand von 35Minuten zwischen Badstraße Ecke Prinzenallee nach Französisch-Buchholz, Kirche bei einer Fahrzeit von 29Minuten. Der Pendelwagen in der Prinzenallee wurde dafür eingestellt. Am 15.Februar 1911 wurde sie wie die anderen Pankower Linien zur Mittelstraße verlängert und der Wagenabstand auf 20Minuten verdichtet. Der Abschnitt in der Bellermannstraße wurde gleichzeitig stillgelegt., Die Treptower Strecke wurde ab dem 1.September 1911 zwischen Wiener Brücke und Köpenicker Landstraße verlegt. Die Neubaustrecke führte entlang der Graetzstraße (heute Karl-Kunger-Straße) und Bouchéstraße, der Abschnitt in der Lohmühlenstraße sowie Am Schlesischen Busch wurde dafür aufgegeben. Für die bisher am Görlitzer Bahnhof endenden Wagen richtete die BESTAG in der Graetzstraße eine Kehranlage ein., Der Niederschönhauser Zweig wurde am 23.Juni 1914 abermals verlängert. Die eingleisige Strecke führte ab der Endhaltestelle Platanenweg über die Wittenauer Straße (heute Friedrich-Engels-Straße) und dem Lübarser Weg (heute Quickborner Straße) zum Bahnhof Rosenthal an der Heidekrautbahn. Die bisher am Platanenweg endenden Wagen fuhren im Abstand von 20Minuten nach Rosenthal, die Linie zum Bismarckplatz behielt ihre Linienführung bei und verkehrte lediglich zur Hauptverkehrszeit bis z: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Am 24. April 1974 wurde mit Günter Guillaume einer der engsten Mitarbeiter des Bundeskanzlers Willy Brandt als DDR-Agent des Ministeriums für Staatssicherheit (MfS, auch: Stasi) enttarnt. Brandt übernahm die politische Verantwortung und trat am 7. Mai 1974 von seinem Amt als Bundeskanzler zurück. Es gilt als wahrscheinlich, dass die Guillaume-Affäre nicht der alleinige Grund für den Rücktritt war, zumal die von Guillaume in die DDR übermittelten Informationen offenbar nicht allzu sicherheitsrelevant waren. Mit Günter Guillaume wurde auch seine mit ihm nachrichtendienstlich zusammenarbeitende Ehefrau Christel Guillaume als Agentin enttarnt., Spionagetätigkeit., Im Auftrag der Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung (HVA) des MfS reiste Guillaume als „Offizier im besonderen Einsatz“ (OibE) 1956 in die Bundesrepublik ein. Der Mitarbeiter des MfS und Offizier der Nationalen Volksarmee (NVA) gab dabei vor, Flüchtling zu sein. Von Beginn an war er auf die Parteiarbeit in der SPD angesetzt und profilierte sich dabei im eher konservativen Flügel in Frankfurt am Main. 1970 gelangte Guillaume als Mitarbeiter ins Bundeskanzleramt und wurde im Oktober 1972 persönlicher Referent des Bundeskanzlers in Parteiangelegenheiten. In dieser Funktion hatte er unter anderem die Parteitermine Brandts, der neben der Kanzlerschaft auch den Parteivorsitz der SPD innehatte, zu organisieren sowie den Schriftverkehr mit Parteigliederungen und Mitgliedern zu führen. Guillaume gehörte damit zum engsten Mitarbeiterkreis Brandts und war einer der wenigen, die den Kanzler auch privat und im Urlaub begleiteten., Enttarnung., Zur Enttarnung Guillaumes kam es auf Grund von Glückwünschen, die die HVA dem Ehepaar Guillaume in den fünfziger Jahren hat zukommen lassen. Am 1. Februar 1956 waren über Agentenfunk Geburtstagsgrüße an „Georg“, am 6. Oktober 1956 Geburtstagsgrüße an „Chr.“ und Mitte April 1957 die Nachricht: „Glückwunsch zum zweiten Mann!“ (damit war sein neu geborener Sohn Pierre gemeint) gesendet worden. Der Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) konnte diese Funksprüche dechiffrieren und archivierte sie. Aufgrund dieser Aufzeichnungen wurde später die Identität Guillaumes zweifelsfrei festgestellt und damit auch seine frühere Tätigkeit für die HVA. Im Februar 1973 war Oberamtsrat Heinrich Schoregge vom Kölner Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV) mit drei Spionagefällen beschäftigt, in denen jeweils Guillaume irgendwie auftauchte. Ein Kollege berichtete ihm von den 17 Jahre alten Funksprüchen, er überprüfte die Daten und konnte sie dem Ehepaar Guillaume zuordnen. Schoregge erstattete Meldung, woraufhin ihm die „vorsichtige Observation der Eheleute […] geraten“ wurde. Bemerkenswert an der Aufspürung Guillaumes in den 1970er Jahren ist, dass er dem BND frühzeitig als potentieller Agent bekannt war: Ein im damaligen Ost-Berliner Verlag \\"Volk und Wissen\\" tätiger früherer Wehrmacht-Unteroffizier hatte den BND schon 1954 auf Guillaume aufmerksam gemacht. Danach übersandte dieser Zuträger dem BND Informationen über die Beauftragung Guillaumes durch diesen Verlag, in die Bundesrepublik einzureisen „mit dem Zweck, Einfluss in Verlagen, Druckereien und Personen zu gewinnen, um sie dann östlich zu infiltrieren“. 1956 siedelte Guillaume in die Bundesrepublik über, wo er ab 1964 in der SPD als Funktionär Karriere machte; vergeblich warnte der BND das Kanzleramt 1969 vor der Einstellung des sich dort bewerbenden Guillaume., Am 29. Mai 1973 sprach der Präsident des Bundesamts für Verfassungsschutz, Günther Nollau, gegenüber dem damaligen Innenminister Hans-Dietrich Genscher erstmals den Spionageverdacht gegen Guillaume an. Genscher unterrichtete daraufhin den Kanzler. Nollau bat darum, Guillaume vorerst in seiner Position zu belassen, um ihn zu observieren, sich ein Bild über das Ausmaß seines Verrats zu machen und weiteres Material zu sammeln. Brandt stimmte diesem Vorgehen zu und informierte nur seinen Büroleiter Reinhard Wilke und den Chef des Kanzleramts, Horst Grabert. Weder Egon Bahr als Brandts engster Berater noch Horst Ehmke, der als Graberts Vorgänger Guillaume eingestellt hatte, wurden über den Verdacht unterrichtet. Wegen der sich lange hinziehenden Ermittlungen blieb Guillaume noch relativ lange in der unmittelbaren Nähe Brandts und begleitete den Kanzler sogar noch im Juli 1973 während dessen Norwegenurlaubs., Am 1. März 1974 suchten Nollau und Genscher den Kanzler auf und Nollau berichtete über die Ermittlungen gegen Guillaume. Nollau kündigte eine Verhaftung Guillaumes für die nächsten zwei bis drei Wochen an. Da gerichtsverwertbare Beweise immer noch nicht vorlagen, schlug Nollau vor, das gesammelte Material dem Generalbundesanwalt zu übergeben, damit dieser über eine förmliche Verfahrenseröffnung entscheide. Brandt unterschätzte die Brisanz der Affäre, von der er glaubte, sie werde sich verlaufen, und widmete ihr weiterhin wenig Aufmerksamkeit., Am 24. April 1974 wurden Guillaume und seine Frau festgenommen. Bei seiner Verhaftung sagte Guillaume: „Ich bin Offizier der Nationalen Volksarmee der DDR und Mitarbeiter des Ministeriums für Staatssicherheit. Ich bitte, meine Offiziersehre zu respektieren“, schwieg aber während des restlichen Verfahrens, weil ihm die gewünschte persönliche Aussprache mit dem menschlich schwer getroffenen Bundeskanzler Brandt nicht zugebilligt wurde. Wegen schweren Landesverrats wurden 1975 Guillaume zu 13 und seine Frau zu 8 Jahren Freiheitsstrafe verurteilt, die sie auf Grund eines Agentenaustausches zwischen der DDR und der Bundesrepublik im Jahr 1981 nicht vollständig verbüßten., Nach dem Ende der DDR und der Entschlüsselung von Datenträgern der HVA stellte sich heraus, dass der Informationswert von Guillaumes Berichten relativ gering war. Die Hälfte betraf SPD-Parteiinterna, ein knappes Viertel Gewerkschaftsfragen. Nur ein gutes Viertel befasste sich mit Regierungspolitik. Von den brisanten Papieren, die Guillaume nach eigener Aussage während des gemeinsamen Norwegen-Urlaubs mit Brandt dem Ministerium für Staatssicherheit angeblich übermittelte, ist in der Datenbank keines verzeichnet. Der geringe Wert der Quelle „Hansen“ zeigt sich auch darin, dass von neunzehn benoteten Informationen vierzehn mit „3“ („mittlerer Wert“) bewertet wurden. Nur fünf erhielten die Note „2“ („wertvoll“) und keine einzige die Note „1“ („sehr wertvoll“)., Rücktritt des Bundeskanzlers., Am 1. Mai 1974 erhielt Brandt von Klaus Kinkel, dem persönlichen Referenten des Innenministers Genscher, ein Dossier des Chefs des Bundeskriminalamtes, Horst Herold. In diesem Dokument waren die im Zuge der Ermittlungen gegen Guillaume protokollierten Aussagen der Sicherheitsbeamten zu Brandts Privatleben zusammengestellt. Dies beinhaltete auch Aussagen zu Brandts Alkoholkonsum und sexuellen Affären. Guillaume soll sogar derjenige gewesen sein, der Brandt „Frauen zugeführt“ habe. Brandts Umfeld fürchtete, dass diese Details, von denen die ersten offenbar bereits an die Medien weitergegeben worden waren, im nächsten Wahlkampf (der dann 1976 stattfand) vom politischen Gegner für eine Medienkampagne genutzt würden. Herold und Nollau sahen zudem das Risiko einer Erpressbarkeit der Bundesregierung mittels gezielter Indiskretion und Preisgabe pikanter Details durch die DDR. In einem persönlichen Gespräch riet Nollau Herbert Wehner, Brandt zum Rücktritt zu bewegen., Am Abend des 4. Mai 1974 kam es in Bad Münstereifel am Rande der turnusmäßigen Beratungen zwischen SPD und Gewerkschaften im \\"Haus Münstereifel\\" zu einem einstündigen Gespräch zwischen Brandt und Wehner. Vermutlich weil Wehner nicht ausdrücklich vom Rücktritt abriet, entschloss sich Brandt zur Demission. Möglicherweise kam aber auch der innere Führungszirkel der SPD –und hier vor allem Wehner– zu dem Schluss, dass dem durch Depressionen, Krankheit und Alkoholprobleme geschwächten Brandt die Kraft fehlte, die zu erwartende Medienkampagne durchzustehen. Wahrscheinlich haben dabei auch die vermeintlich besseren Erfolgsaussichten der SPD im bevorstehenden Wahlkampf mit einem neuen, unbelasteten Kanzler eine Rolle gespielt. Wehner behauptete später, er habe Brandt versichert, er werde sich im Zweifelsfalle für ihn „zerreißen“ lassen, wenn Brandt sich dafür entscheide, die Sache durchzustehen. Brandt hingegen stellte es so dar, dass ihm die entscheidende Unterstützung Wehners, Helmut Schmidts und anderer versagt geblieben sei. Den letzten Ausschlag habe am Morgen die Äußerung seiner Frau Rut Brandt, einer müsse schließlich die Verantwortung übernehmen, gegeben., Am Morgen des 5. Mai 1974 verkündete Brandt den in Bad Münstereifel anwesenden Spitzenpolitikern der SPD seine Entscheidung, zurückzutreten. Ein entsprechendes Schreiben ließ er am Abend des 6.Mai durch den Kanzleramtschef Horst Grabert dem in Hamburg weilenden Bundespräsidenten Gustav Heinemann überbringen. Brandt übernahm damit auch die politische Verantwortung für die nachträglich als Fahrlässigkeit beurteilte Entscheidung, Guillaume nicht gleich zu verhaften. In seinem nicht für die Öffentlichkeit bestimmten Begleitschreiben zur Rücktrittserklärung schrieb Brandt: „Ich bleibe in der Politik, aber die jetzige Last muss ich loswerden.“, Am 7. Mai 1974 wurde der Rücktritt Brandts um 0 Uhr vom NDR bekannt gegeben. Die Nachrichtensendungen des Fernsehens zeigten am folgenden Tag eine Szene, die sich nachhaltig im kollektiven Gedächtnis etablieren sollte: In der Fraktionssitzung legt Wehner einen großen Blumenstrauß auf den Platz Brandts, der weinende Egon Bahr vergräbt sein Gesicht in den Händen., Helmut Schmidt sagte später (im Interview bei Reinhold Beckmann), Brandts Depressionen seien der Hauptgrund für den Rücktritt gewesen. Er (Schmidt) habe „Schiss“ gehabt (wörtlich), das Amt des Bundeskanzlers zu bekleiden; er habe Brandt angeschrien, ihm gesagt, dass diese Affäre überhaupt kein Grund zum Rücktritt sei., Politische Folgen., Die Guillaume-Affäre fiel in die Zeit kurz nach Unterzeichnung des Grundlagenvertrages, Brandts Rücktritt erfolgte fünf Tage nach Eröffnung der \\"Ständigen Vertretung der Bundesrepublik in der DDR\\". Auch wenn die offizielle Stellungnahme der DDR-Regierung, man habe Guillaume im Zuge der Entspannungspolitik bereits „abgeschaltet“, bezweifelt werden muss, lag der Sturz Brandts nicht: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1970er, Politische Affäre, Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Staatssicherheit, DDR, Willy Brandt, Guillaume-Affäre, Spionagefall, Günter Guillaume, Rücktritt"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Atlantis (Raumfähre), Kanadische Raumfahrt, NASA, Raumfahrtmission 2006], STS-115 (englisch Space Transportation System) ist die Missionsbezeichnung für einen Flug des US-amerikanischen Space Shuttle Atlantis (OV-104) der NASA. Der Start fand am 9. September 2006 statt. Es war die 116. Space-Shuttle-Mission und der 27. Flug der Raumfähre Atlantis. Dieser 19. Flug einer US-Raumfähre zur Internationalen Raumstation (ISS) war der erste operationelle Shuttle-Flug seit der Columbia-Katastrophe und dem weiteren ISS-Ausbau gewidmet., Mannschaft., Jett und Tanner waren bereits bei STS-97 gemeinsam im All gewesen., Missionsüberblick., Mit dieser Shuttle-Mission wurde erstmals wieder seit STS-113 im November 2002 die Internationale Raumstation (ISS) weiter ausgebaut. Hauptnutzlast war der P3/P4-Träger mit den Solarmodulen 2A und 4A. Dieser Kollektor ist das zweite von vier geplanten Paneelen, die die Energie für die ISS liefern. Bei drei Außenbordtätigkeiten wurde das Segment P3/P4 montiert. Zudem wurden 360Kilogramm Ausrüstung und 470Liter Wasser zur Station und 490Kilogramm nicht mehr benötigter Teile (abgeschlossene Experimente, Ausrüstung, Müll) wieder zurück zur Erde gebracht., Vorbereitungen., Ursprünglich, als die Mission für Mai 2003 geplant war, wollte die NASA die Endeavour als Orbiter einsetzen. Nach dem Unglück der Columbia im Frühjahr 2003 entschied die US-Raumfahrtbehörde, die Endeavour zu modernisieren – seit dem Dezember des Jahres wurde die Fähre am Kennedy Space Center (KSC) umgebaut., Die Erfahrungen während STS-114 führten dazu, dass man sich im August 2005 entschloss, bis zur nächsten Mission noch ein Jahr zu warten. Dadurch konnte die Discovery für beide „Return-to-Flight“-Missionen eingesetzt werden. Andererseits wurde es damit möglich, die etwas modernere Atlantis die STS-115-Mission durchführen zu lassen. Dieser Orbiter sollte eigentlich für den zweiten Testflug (STS-121) im Herbst 2005 eingesetzt werden und war sogar schon für den Start montiert worden., Während der Vorbereitungen auf die Mission STS-115 wurde ein neues Verfahren zur Montage der Füllstreifen zwischen den Hitzeschutzkacheln entwickelt. Dieses soll verhindern, dass Streifen beim Start verschoben werden, aus dem Hitzeschild herausragen und so zu aerodynamischen Veränderungen an der Unterseite des Orbiters führen können, wie dies bei STS-114 geschehen war., Anfang Juni 2006 wurde im Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) mit dem Zusammenbau der Feststoffraketen begonnen, der drei Wochen später abgeschlossen war. Der Außentank für die Atlantis kam in der zweiten Juniwoche in Florida an. So sollte im Falle einer Havarie der Mission STS-121 schon Mitte August ein Rettungsflug möglich sein. Dieser hätte dann die Missionsbezeichnung STS-300 getragen., Der Außentank konnte nicht vollständig fertiggestellt werden, da eine rasche Verfügbarkeit gefordert war. So mussten beispielsweise die Füllstandsmesser (ECO-Sensoren) ausgetauscht werden. Der Hersteller Lockheed Martin schickte mehrere Dutzend Mitarbeiter von Louisiana zum KSC, um die letzten Arbeiten vor Ort ausführen zu lassen., Unachtsamkeit führte dazu, dass der externe Tank am 19. Juni beschädigt wurde. Arbeiter stießen mit einer transportablen Arbeitsbühne gegen den Tank. Ein etwa ein Zentimeter starkes Stück Isolierschaum splitterte ab. Beim Ausbessern der Stelle tropfte Wasser aus der Isolierung. Vermutlich stammte das Wasser vom August 2005, als der Hurrikan Katrina die Werkshallen bei New Orleans verwüstet hatte. Es wurde ein kleines Loch in die Isolierung gebohrt, damit das Wasser abfließen konnte. Anschließend wurde es verspachtelt., Nachdem die vorbereitenden Arbeiten am Orbiter abgeschlossen waren, wurde die Atlantis am 24. Juli 2006 in das VAB überführt. Dort erfolgte der Zusammenbau mit dem Außentank und den beiden Feststoffraketen. Das System wurde am 2. August zur 6,8 Kilometer entfernten Startrampe 39B gerollt, nachdem das Vorhaben zwei Mal wegen schlechten Wetters verschoben werden musste., Anfang August wurde die Nutzlast, die Gitterstruktur P3/P4, in den Frachtraum der Atlantis verladen und eine Woche später führte die Besatzung die abschließende Countdown-Generalprobe durch. Nach der zweitägigen Flugbereitschaftsabnahme, dem sogenannten Flight Readiness Review, wurden am 16. August alle Systeme der Atlantis für startbereit erklärt. Gleichzeitig wurde der 27. August, der vorläufige Starttermin, bestätigt., Die NASA ordnete am 18. August eine zweitägige Reparatur an, weil nicht eindeutig nachprüfbar war, ob die Ku-Band-Antenne ordnungsgemäß befestigt war. Die Antenne befindet sich an der Steuerbordseite der Nutzlastbucht direkt hinter dem Cockpit und ist für den Hauptteil der Kommunikation zwischen Raumfähre und Bodenstation zuständig. Obwohl die 150-Kilogramm-Antenne seit dem Jungfernflug des Orbiters nie Probleme bereitet hatte, ergab eine kurz zuvor durchgeführte Überprüfung der Begleitpapiere, dass nicht sicher war, dass die vier Befestigungsschrauben die vorgeschriebene Länge hatten. NASA-Techniker vermuteten, dass zwei Schrauben kürzer seien und damit ein Losbrechen der Antenne beim Start möglich wäre, was katastrophale Folgen haben könnte. Diese sehr schwierige Reparatur wurde am 20. August erfolgreich abgeschlossen., Missionsverlauf., Erster Startversuch., Der Countdown begann am 24. August 2006. Zuvor traf die Crew am Kennedy Space Center in Florida ein. Zu Beginn des Countdowns wurden die Wetteraussichten von der NASA als gut bezeichnet, es bestehe eine 70%ige Chance für gutes Wetter. Bis einen Tag vor dem geplanten Start schrumpfte diese Chance auf 40 %. Zudem wurde die Startrampe am 25. August von einem Blitz getroffen, deshalb mussten verschiedene Systeme am Orbiter nochmals überprüft werden, was zu Verzögerungen führte. Aus diesen Gründen wurde der Start zunächst um einen Tag, später um einen weiteren Tag verschoben., Die NASA hatte noch am 27. August befürchtet, den Start bis Ende Oktober verschieben zu müssen, da der Tropensturm Ernesto an Florida heranrückte. Einen Tag später wurde entschieden, den Shuttle am 29. August in die sichere Montagehalle (VAB) zurückzufahren. Kurz vor Erreichen des VAB wurde die Fähre jedoch angehalten und zurück zur Startrampe transportiert. Die Meteorologen hatten inzwischen Entwarnung gegeben; der Tropensturm würde nach den jüngsten Wettervorhersagen keine Gefahr für die Raumfähre darstellen, da sich Ernesto abgeschwächt hatte, hieß es. Ein neuer Starttermin wurde zunächst nicht mitgeteilt., Ursprünglich war das Startfenster nur bis zum 7. September geöffnet, wobei es täglich eine Startmöglichkeit von zehn Minuten Dauer gab. Die NASA hatte zwar (theoretisch) die Möglichkeit, den Shuttle bis zum 13. September zur ISS zu schicken, jedoch hätte ein Start nach dem 7. bedeutet, dass Roskosmos den ursprünglich für den 14. September geplanten Flug von Sojus TMA-9 hätte verschieben müssen. Man wollte aber vermeiden, dass Shuttle und Sojus gleichzeitig an der ISS angedockt sind, da aus Sicherheitsgründen eines der Raumschiffe nicht an die Station anlegen darf, solange das andere angekoppelt ist. Außerdem hätte ein Start nach dem 18. September bedeutet, dass die Sojus-TMA-8-Kapsel bei Nacht hätte zur Erde zurückkehren müssen, was man verhindern wollte., Die NASA und Roskosmos vereinbarten schließlich am 30. August, das Startfenster bis zum 8. September auszudehnen. Das wurde erreicht, weil Roskosmos den Start der Sojus-Rakete auf den 18. September verschob., Als das Kennedy Space Center am 31. August wieder geöffnet wurde, nachdem der Sturm vorüber gezogen war, stellten die NASA-Techniker fest, dass die Schäden nur minimal waren. Umgehend wurden die Vorbereitungen für den Start wieder aufgenommen und mit dem 6. September ein neuer Termin festgesetzt., Zweiter Startversuch., Am 3. September begann der zweite Countdown dieser Mission. Mit 76 Stunden war er dieses Mal sechs Stunden länger, um den Ingenieuren mehr Zeit zu geben, um auf unerwartete Probleme reagieren zu können. Am Vortag war die sechsköpfige Besatzung am Kennedy Space Center eingetroffen. Der Starttermin wurde nach der Wiederaufnahme des Countdowns wegen technischer Probleme mit der Kühlmittelpumpe in einer der drei Brennstoffzellen erneut zwei Mal verschoben und schließlich auf den 8. September festgesetzt. Am 7. September entschied die NASA, am geplanten Termin festzuhalten, obwohl das Problem mit der Brennstoffzelle noch nicht gelöst war. Die Entscheidung fiel nach langer Diskussion einstimmig., Am 8. September wurde zusätzlich ein Problem mit einem der ECO-Treibstoffsensoren im Außentank festgestellt. Weniger als eine Stunde vor dem geplanten Termin wurde der Start erneut abgesagt und um 24 Stunden verschoben. Um die Mission nicht bis Ende Oktober verschieben zu müssen, entschied die NASA, am 9. September einen weiteren Startversuch zu unternehmen., Start und Kopplung., Der Start der 116. Shuttle-Mission erfolgte am 9. September 2006 um 15:14:55 UTC., Der zweite Flugtag und damit der erste volle Tag im All begann mit dem traditionellen Wecksong für die Astronauten. Gespielt wurde „Moon River“ für den Kommandanten Brent Jett. 18 Stunden nach dem Start begann die Mannschaft, die Raumfähre mit dem OBSS-Inspektionsarm auf mögliche Beschädigungen zu überprüfen., Einen Großteil des Arbeitstages verbrachten die Astronauten damit, vor allem die Flügelvorderkanten und die Orbiternase zu inspizieren., Diese erste Untersuchung ergab, dass kein Defekt an dem sensiblen Hitzeschild festgestellt werden konnte, obwohl sich beim Start Stücke des Isolierschaums vom Außentank gelöst hatten., Am 11. September um 10:48 UTC koppelte das Shuttle an die Internationale Raumstation (ISS) an. Zuvor hatte die Atlantis in 180 Meter Entfernung eine langsame Drehung um 360° über die Querachse vollführt, um der ISS-Besatzung die Möglichkeit zu geben, hochauflösende Aufnahmen von der Unterseite des Orbiters anfertigen zu können. Gut eineinhalb Stunden nach der Kopplung wurden um 12:30 UTC die Luken zwischen ISS und Shuttle geöffnet., Arbeiten auf der ISS., Drei Stunden nach dem Andocken wurde die Gitterstruktur P3/P4 gegen 13:45 UTC mit dem Greifarm des Orbiters aus dessen Nutzlastbucht gehoben. Um 14:52 UTC wurde die Struktur dem ISS-Roboterarm übergeben, an dem sie bis zum nächsten Tag verblieb. Gesteuert wurde der Arm der Station von Missionsspezialist Steve MacLean, der die Übergabe als „kanadischen Handschlag“ bezeichnete, weil beide Manipulatoren aus Kanada stammen., Bei dieser Mission kam erstmals ein Verfahren zum Einsatz, das die Vorbereitung auf Weltraumausstiege (EVAs) vereinfachen und verkürzen soll. Bisher atmeten die Shuttle-Astronauten einige Stunden vor der EVA reinen Sauerstoff bei vermindertem Luftdruck (703 hPa) ein, bevor sie ihre Raumanzüge anlegten.: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Der Fernsehturm befindet sich im Park am Fernsehturm im Berliner Ortsteil Mitte. Er war im Jahr der Fertigstellung 1969 der zweithöchste Fernsehturm der Welt und zählt mit über einer Million Besuchern jährlich zu den zehn beliebtesten Sehenswürdigkeiten in Deutschland., Der Fernsehturm im Internationalen Stil wurde 1965–1969 von der Deutschen Post der DDR im Park am Fernsehturm anstelle des abgerissenen Marienviertels errichtet. Am 3. Oktober 1969 erfolgte die Eröffnung. Das Bauwerk ist über 220Meter höher als der alte Berliner Funkturm aus den 1920er Jahren im Westteil der Stadt. Als Wahrzeichen und weithin sichtbare Landmarke prägt es die Skyline der Stadt. In Eröffnungsszenen von Filmen mit Bezug zu Berlin wird die Hauptstadt neben Bauwerken wie dem Brandenburger Tor, der Siegessäule und dem Reichstagsgebäude häufig durch den Fernsehturm symbolisiert., Das intern als „Fernmeldeturm 32“ bezeichnete Bauwerk dient neben seiner Hauptfunktion als Standort mehrerer Rundfunksender für Hörfunk und Fernsehen als Aussichtsturm mit einer Aussichtsetage inklusive Bar auf 203 Metern Höhe und beinhaltet ein Drehrestaurant. Darüber hinaus dient der Berliner Fernsehturm als Veranstaltungsort. Das markante und stadtprägende Bauwerk unterlag einer starken symbolischen Wandlung. Von einem politisch vereinnahmten nationalen Symbol der DDR entwickelte es sich nach der deutschen Wiedervereinigung zum gesamtstädtischen Symbol im wiedervereinten Berlin. Aufgrund seiner universellen und zeitlosen Formensprache fand es zunehmend als Markenzeichen Verwendung und wird international mit Berlin und Deutschland identifiziert. Der Berliner Fernsehturm erhielt 1979 in der DDR den Denkmalstatus, der nach der deutschen Wiedervereinigung fortgeschrieben wurde., Geschichte., Vorgeschichte., Bei der Europäischen Rundfunkkonferenz in Stockholm 1952, die für die Koordinierung der Frequenzwellen in Europa zuständig war, wurden der damals von den meisten Staaten politisch nicht anerkannten DDR nur zwei Fernsehfrequenzbereiche zugestanden: für BandI der als störanfällig eingestufte (und später nicht mehr verwendbare) Frequenzbereich von 40,5 bis 48,5MHz und der Frequenzbereich von 208 bis 216MHz für BandIII. Unter diesen Voraussetzungen konnte das Berliner Stadtgebiet nicht mit mehreren kleineren Sendern ausgestattet werden, ohne dass es zu Überlagerungen und damit zu Störungen oder Lücken im Fernsehempfang gekommen wäre. Für eine vollständige und lückenlose Abdeckung war somit ein leistungsstarker Großsender mit einem möglichst hohen Standort erforderlich. In den 1950er Jahren erfüllten nur sehr schwache Behelfssender des Deutschen Fernsehfunks ihren Zweck in Berlin., Gescheiterte Bauprojekte., Im Jahr 1952 begann die Deutsche Post mit der Planung eines Fernsehturms für Berlin. Die Hauptverwaltung Funkwesen favorisierte dafür ein Grundstück in den Berliner Müggelbergen, die mit der höchsten Erhebung im Berliner Umfeld topografisch die beste Voraussetzung innerhalb des Berliner Stadtgebietes boten. In den Überlegungen spielte eine Rolle, dass der Standort für solch einen Zweckbau weitab vom Zentrum lag und damit weder die architektonische noch die städtebauliche Dimension beeinflusste. Nachdem die Deutsche Post am 23.April 1954 beim Chefarchitekten des Ost-Berliner Magistrats Hermann Henselmann die Standortgenehmigung beantragt hatte, wurde diese am 4.Mai 1954 erteilt. Das Gelände und der Turm sollten für die Bevölkerung zugänglich sein, die Höhe des Bauwerks war mit 130Metern geplant. Der Betonbau mit quadratischem Grundriss sollte auf 70Metern Höhe zwei Aussichtsplattformen enthalten, aber keinen auskragenden Turmkorb. Der Fernsehturm unter dem Decknamen \\"F4\\" war mit einer Bilanzsumme von 8,714Millionen Mark angesetzt und in den Volkswirtschaftsplan für die Jahre 1954 bis 1957 aufgenommen. Am 13.Dezember 1955 forderte Innenminister Karl Maron die sofortige Einstellung der bereits in vollem Gang befindlichen Bauarbeiten. Zwar hatte das Ministerium am 29.Mai 1954 dem Bauvorhaben zugestimmt; es habe allerdings nun festgestellt, dass der Standort nur acht Kilometer vom Flughafen Berlin-Schönefeld entfernt liege und durch seine Höhe am Rande der Einflugschneise den Flugbetrieb zu gefährden drohe. Verschiedene Kompromissbemühungen der Post, die Turmhöhe zu reduzieren, scheiterten, sodass am 15.November 1956 das Bauprojekt endgültig eingestellt wurde. Das Ende des Projektes stellt ein frühes Beispiel für die konzeptionellen Probleme der ostdeutschen Planwirtschaft dar, die in diesem Fall den Aufbau des Fernseh- und Richtfunknetzes der DDR um Jahre zurückwarf. Der bis dahin fertiggestellte Gebäudestumpf des Fernsehturms Müggelberge mit zwei Obergeschossen wurde wetterfest gemacht und dient jetzt der Deutschen Telekom als Richtfunkknoten., Nach dem Scheitern des \\"Projektes F4\\" musste das Ministerium für Post und Fernmeldewesen nach einer geeigneten Alternative suchen. Zu jener Zeit gab es auf der Fläche der DDR drei sich berührende Ringe von Richtfunkverbindungen: den Nord-, den Mittel- und den Südring; ein Ostring war für später geplant. An den Berührungspunkten von Nord- mit Mittel- und Mittel- mit Südring waren die zentralen Fernsehtürme Berlin und Leipzig vorgesehen. 1957 setzte deshalb für den Ost-Berliner Fernsehturm eine neue Projektierungsphase ein. Mittlerweile war in der DDR mit dem Fernsehturm Dequede der erste Fernsehturm aus Stahlbeton nach dem Vorbild des Stuttgarter Fernsehturms im Bau. Die wieder ungeklärte Standortfrage führte Ende 1957 dazu, dass das Postministerium einen Vorstoß unternahm, den Turm in der Innenstadt zu errichten. Alle anderen Areale waren entweder wegen der Gefährdung des Flugbetriebs ungeeignet oder schwer in das Richtfunknetz einzubinden. Den Plan der ersten Variante eines zentral im Stadtgebiet gelegenen Fernsehturms legten die Architekten Gerhard Frost und Waldemar Alder in den Jahren 1957/1958 vor. Sie favorisierten die hügelige Parkanlage des Volksparks Friedrichshain. In der Folge wurden vier weitere Standorte in der Nähe des Parks diskutiert. Nach nur zögerlichem Fortschritt kam am 24.Juli 1960 ein positives Gutachten zum ausgewählten Standort zur Beschlussfassung und die Staatliche Plankommission schuf wenige Tage danach die ökonomischen Voraussetzungen für die Errichtung. Laut Plan sollte der Fernsehturm in Friedrichshain 1964 einsatzbereit sein., Eine besonders schwere wirtschaftliche Krise – unter anderem wegen der enormen Kosten des Baus der Berliner Mauer – zwang die Regierung im Frühjahr 1962, ihren Siebenjahresplan – den einzigen der DDR-Geschichte – vorzeitig abzubrechen. Der Fernsehturm in Friedrichshain fiel dem Sparzwang zum Opfer; der Ost-Berliner Magistrat beschloss am 26.Mai 1962 das Ende des Projektes. Der Abbruch war ein Rückschlag für das Postministerium und drohte alle anderen Türme im Rundfunknetz zu Investitionsruinen werden zu lassen. Die 1960 geschätzten Kosten lagen bei rund 20Millionen Mark; bereits am 5.Mai 1961 wurde diese Schätzung vom Ministerium auf 29,322Millionen Mark und im Januar 1962 abermals auf 30,7Millionen Mark korrigiert. Trotz des beschlossenen Planungsendes und der fehlenden Mittel erfolgten Fundamentbohrungen zur Erkundung des Baugrunds, und Bauunternehmen erhielten erste Aufträge. Die Mieter, die auf dem geplanten Errichtungsstandort wohnten, hatten ihre Wohnungen verlassen müssen; die Häuser wurden zum größten Teil abgerissen. Der Baubeginn war kaum noch aufzuhalten. Bereits Ende 1961 gab eine Kommission zur „Überwindung der technischen Rückstände auf dem Gebiet des Rundfunks und Fernsehens“ bekannt, dass zum damaligen Zeitpunkt statt der geplanten 26 nur 16 UKW-Sender zur Verfügung standen und diese nur etwa 80Prozent der Bevölkerung mit Fernsehprogrammen versorgen konnten. Die Schließung der Grenzen nach Westdeutschland erschwerte die Produktion und Instandhaltung wegen dringend benötigter Importe. Zu den besonders schlecht mit DDR-Fernsehen versorgten Gebieten zählte neben den Landstrichen an der innerdeutschen Grenze der Bereich nordwestlich von Berlin. Das Postministerium führte Verhandlungen, um den Turmbau wenigstens für das Jahr 1963 im Plan zu verankern. Trotz finanzieller Zusage von 300.000Mark für die Bauvorbereitung wurde das Projekt ein weiteres Mal storniert und der Standort Friedrichshain endgültig aufgegeben. Alle Verträge wurden gekündigt., Erneute Standortsuche., Nach dem endgültigen Baustopp im Volkspark Friedrichshain erwartete die Regierung vom Ministerium weitere Vorschläge zur Verbesserung der Rundfunkversorgung in der Hauptstadt. Um die Kosten gering zu halten, folgten mehrere abgespeckte Vorschläge. Die Variante, auf einen zentralen Turm zu verzichten und vier kleinere Funkstandorte zu errichten, war eine Option. Damit wären beträchtliche Einbußen in der Funkversorgung verbunden gewesen. Da die Regierung ein besonderes Interesse an der Rundfunkversorgung hatte, stieg der politische Druck zur Umsetzung, sodass der Turmbau in den Volkswirtschaftsplan 1964 erneut aufgenommen wurde. Allerdings erwogen die Planer, den Publikumsbereich aus Kostengründen zu streichen; die Standortwahl war wieder ungewiss. Das Rundfunk- und Fernsehtechnische Zentralamt (RFZ) der Deutschen Post untersuchte mehrere Standorte und kam nach verschiedenen Analysen zum Schluss, dass der Standort Friedrichshain die perfekte Lösung sei. Daher versuchte das Ministerium im Januar 1964 in einem neuen Anlauf, das Baugrundstück am Friedrichshain durchzusetzen. Mit Beschluss vom 13.Februar 1964 akzeptierte der Ministerrat die bauliche und technische Konzeption. In der ersten Jahreshälfte 1964 nahmen die Planungen, die seit über zehn Jahren ergebnislos waren, wieder Fahrt auf. Neben dem sachlichen Zweck der optimalen Rundfunkversorgung rückte die Rolle des Turms als neues Wahrzeichen immer mehr in den Vordergrund. In einem Brief der Staatlichen Plankommission vom 23.Mai 1964 heißt es dazu:, Der Fernsehturm als städtebauliche Höhendominante erschien vielen Parteifunktionären als angemessener Ersatz für das nicht realisierte Zentrale Hochhaus, das bei der sozialistischen Umgestaltung des Ost-Berliner Zentrums anstelle des abgerissenen Berliner Schlosses gebaut werden sollte. Im Zusammenhang mit diesem Architekturwettbewerb Ende der 1950er Jahre hatte Hermann Henselmann den Vorschlag unterbreitet, einen 300Meter hohen \\"Turm der Signale\\" zu errichten, dessen Turmschaft aus drei konkav gekrümmten und mit weiß-goldenem Mosaik belegten Schalen bestehen soll: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Architektur (DDR), Aussichtsturm, Betonbau, Berlin-Mitte, Fernsehturm, Gastronomiebetrieb, Hermann Henselmann, Wahrzeichen, symbolisiert, Geschichte."},{"prompt":"informacion de tecnologia tres parrafos","completion":"La tecnología es el conjunto de conocimientos, herramientas, técnicas y procesos utilizados para crear, diseñar y mejorar objetos, estructuras y sistemas para facilitar la vida cotidiana de las personas.

Es war der letzte planmäßige Shuttle-Start von Pad 39B, bevor die Startrampe deaktiviert wurde und seitdem für das neue Space Launch System umgebaut wird., Mannschaft., Shuttle-Besatzung., Polansky und Curbeam waren bereits bei STS-98 gemeinsam im All gewesen., ISS-Crew Hinflug., ISS-Expedition 14/ISS-Expedition 15, ISS-Crew Rückflug., ISS-Expedition 13/ISS-Expedition 14, Missionsüberblick., Hauptnutzlast der Mission war die Gitterstruktur P5 mit einer Masse von 1,9Tonnen, die während des ersten Weltraumausstiegs an der Internationalen Raumstation montiert wurde. Daneben wurden bei zwei weiteren Außenbordeinsätzen die Energiesysteme der Station neu konfiguriert, um die provisorische Verkabelung in den von den Ingenieuren geplanten Endzustand zu versetzen. Dadurch konnten die im September 2006 montierten Solarzellen des P3/P4-Moduls an die stationseigene Energieversorgung angeschlossen werden. Während eines vierten Ausstiegs, der zusätzlich angeordnet wurde, reparierten zwei Astronauten ein verklemmtes Sonnenpaneel, das sich nicht automatisch einfahren ließ., Die Raumfähre brachte 2,4Tonnen Ausrüstung (davon 1,9Tonnen im Spacehab) zur Station und nahm 1,7Tonnen nicht mehr benötigter Teile (abgeschlossene Experimente, Ausrüstung, Müll) wieder zurück zur Erde. Weiterhin kam es zu einer Wachablösung: Der deutsche Raumfahrer Thomas Reiter wurde von der Amerikanerin Sunita Williams abgelöst und kehrte nach seinem halbjährigen Aufenthalt auf der ISS wieder aus der Umlaufbahn zurück. Mit den fünf Raumflugneulingen von STS-116 stieg die Zahl der Menschen, die in den Weltraum geflogen sind, auf 454., Vorbereitungen., Kurz nach Ende der letzten Discovery-Mission, STS-121, wurde der Orbiter auf Schäden untersucht. Dabei wurden 93 Beschädigungen im Hitzeschild ausfindig gemacht, von denen elf größer als 2,5Zentimeter waren.

Diese wurden zur besseren Untersuchung abmontiert. Außerdem wurden im August 2006 eine Brennstoffzelle, ein Heizelement und die Hilfskraftanlage Nr. 3 ausgetauscht., Zudem führte man einige Nutzlastverladungstests mit dem Spacehab-Frachtmodul durch, das am 3. November 2006 in den Nutzlastcontainer verladen und vier Tage später zur Startrampe gefahren wurde. In der Montagehalle (VAB) wurde nach einigen Tests am 13. Oktober der Außentank, der zuvor am 21. September mit einem Schiff im Kennedy Space Center (KSC) eintraf, zwischen die beiden Feststoffraketen montiert., Am 1. November wurde der Orbiter in das VAB überführt, in dem er mit dem Außentank sowie den zwei Boostern verbunden wurde. Die Discovery wurde schließlich am 9. November zur Startrampe 39B gerollt. Die 6,8 Kilometer lange Strecke wurde in achteinhalb Stunden zurückgelegt., Unter den Augen tausender Schaulustiger wurde am 17. November 2006 eine Shuttle-Feststoffrakete der aktuellen Konfiguration in einem Teststand des Herstellers in Utah erprobt. Der Booster wurde um 01:00 UTC gezündet (18:00 Uhr Ortszeit am 16. November). Die NASA hielt diesen zweiminütigen Probelauf für notwendig, weil der Orbiter erstmals seit dem Absturz der Columbia einen Nachtstart unternehmen sollte. Mit 31 Kameras und 658 Datenkanälen wurde der Abbrand dokumentiert, um Vergleichswerte zu erhalten, die mit den Bildern und Messungen von STS-116 abgeglichen werden konnten., Ende November wurde am KSC die traditionelle zweitägige Flugbereitschaftsabnahme abgehalten. Im Anschluss an dieses sogenannte Flight Readiness Review, an dem die für den Flug Verantwortlichen teilnahmen, wurden am 29. November alle Systeme des Space Shuttles für startbereit erklärt. Gleichzeitig wurde der vorläufige Starttermin, der 8. Dezember, bestätigt., Missionsverlauf., Erster Startversuch., 31 Stunden nachdem die siebenköpfige Besatzung in Florida eintraf, begann am 5. Dezember 2006 der Countdown für diese Mission. Zunächst gingen die NASA-Meteorologen mit einer 70-prozentigen Wahrscheinlichkeit davon aus, dass die Wetterbedingungen für einen Start am Morgen des 8. Dezember akzeptabel seien. Dann zog eine Kaltfront auf und das Wetter verschlechterte sich., Am 6. Dezember hatten zwei technische Probleme zwischenzeitlich die NASA-Verantwortlichen beschäftigt: Ein Test lieferte ungewöhnliche Ergebnisse und warf die Frage auf, ob bei den beiden Feststoffraketen die richtigen Segmentverbindungskleber verwendet wurden. Außerdem war eine kurzzeitige Spannungsspitze in den die Raumfähre auf der Startrampe mit Energie versorgenden Stromleitungen aufgetreten. Beide Vorkommnisse wurden geprüft und als unbedenklich eingestuft., Obwohl die NASA für den 8. Dezember nur noch eine 40-Prozent-Chance angab, dass der Start nicht durch tiefhängende Wolken und Regenschauer im Startgebiet gefährdet würde, setzte man den Countdown fort. Die Wolkendecke blieb jedoch geschlossen, weshalb der Startversuch in der letzten Minute abgebrochen werden musste, denn bei einem Notfall während des Aufstiegs hätte die schlechte Sicht eine Rückkehr der Raumfähre zum Startplatz verhindert. Im planmäßigen Countdown-Hold bei T-9 Minuten, der für eine letzte Prüfung der Startkriterien genutzt wird, wurde entschieden, bei anhaltend schlechter Wolkenlage einen weiteren Halt bei T-5 Minuten einzulegen. Innerhalb dieser zusätzlichen Haltephase kam es zu keiner Wetterbesserung und das Ende des Startfensters wurde erreicht. Der Start wurde um 2:36 UTC abgebrochen., Weil die Meteorologen der Raumfahrtbehörde für den nächsten Tag eine 90-prozentige Wahrscheinlichkeit für einen erneuten Startabbruch vorhersagten, setzte die NASA eine Verschiebung von 48 Stunden an. Für den 10. Dezember war der Wetterbericht allerdings nur etwas besser., Start., Mit zweitägiger Verspätung brach die Discovery beim zweiten Startversuch am 10. Dezember 2006 in Richtung Internationale Raumstation auf. Obwohl die Wetteraussichten zunächst nur zu 30 Prozent von günstigen Bedingungen ausgingen und die Regenwahrscheinlichkeit bei 20 Prozent lag, wurde der Countdown am Vortag um 8:52 UTC bei der T-11-Stunden-Marke wieder aufgenommen., Wegen nicht näher bezeichneter Probleme mit dem RSS-Zugangsgerüst konnte diese sogenannte Rotating Service Structure erst mit zehn Stunden Verspätung vom Orbiter weggeschwenkt werden. Das brachte den Zeitplan durcheinander und führte dazu, dass die Betankung des rostbraunen Außentanks ebenfalls erst mit einer zweistündigen Verzögerung eingeleitet werden konnte. Durch die eingebauten Pufferzeiten, Holds genannt, war genügend Spielraum im Countdown vorhanden, alle Arbeiten bis zum geplanten Startzeitpunkt beenden zu können., Neben dem Wetter am Startplatz in Florida mussten die meteorologischen Faktoren auch auf den Notlandeplätzen in Spanien und Frankreich beachtet werden. Beim ersten Startversuch herrschten an den drei Ausweichorten ähnlich schlechte Witterungsverhältnisse wie am Kennedy Space Center. Diesmal sah die Situation in Europa besser aus. Dafür machten der NASA starke Seitenwinde an der Shuttle Landing Facility Sorgen, die nahe am zulässigen Limit lagen. Da sich das Wetter in den letzten Stunden vor dem Start besserte und die NASA-Meteorologen schließlich sogar 70 Prozent für eine gute Wetterlage prophezeiten, konnte die Discovery pünktlich um 01:47:35 UTC abheben. Es war der erste Nachtstart seit vier Jahren., Inspektion und Kopplung., Der erste volle Arbeitstag im All begann für die Besatzung 14 Stunden nach dem Start. Auf dem Programm stand die seit STS-114 obligatorische Überprüfung des empfindlichen Hitzeschildes. Mit Hilfe des OBSS-Inspektionsarms, der mit dem Roboterarm des Shuttles verbunden wird und über Präzisionskameras verfügt, wurden die sensiblen Bereiche des Orbiters untersucht. Nacheinander wurden die rechte Tragfläche, die Nase und der linke Flügel untersucht. Erste Auswertungen der NASA-Ingenieure in Houston ergaben keinen Hinweis auf Beschädigungen der Hitzeschutzkacheln., Am 11. Dezember um 22:12 UTC erfolgte dann das Andocken an die Internationale Raumstation (ISS). Zuvor führte Shuttle-Kommandant Mark Polansky das „Purzelbaum-Rückwärts-Manöver“ durch, um von der ISS-Besatzung die gesamte Unterseite des Orbiters fotografieren zu lassen, um auch mögliche Kleinstschäden am Hitzeschutzschild aufzudecken., Kurz nach der Begrüßung der beiden Besatzungen ordnete die Bodenkontrolle eine Änderung des Flugplans an. Ein Beschleunigungsmesser in der Steuerbordtragfläche hatte gegen 10:30 UTC, zwölf Stunden vor der Kopplung, während die Shuttle-Besatzung schlief, einen möglichen Einschlag angezeigt. Mit dem Roboterarm der ISS nahmen die Astronauten deshalb eine zusätzliche visuelle Inspektion der linken Flügelvorderkante vor. Der Verdacht einer Beschädigung wurde aber nicht bestätigt. Erst danach konnte die Hauptnutzlast der Discovery mit dem Shuttle-Greifarm aus der Frachtluke gehoben und das P5-Verbindungsstück an den ISS-Arm übergeben werden., Arbeiten auf der ISS., Der 12. Dezember (vierter Flugtag) stand ganz im Zeichen des ersten Weltraumausstiegs (EVA) dieser Mission. US-Astronaut Bob Curbeam und sein schwedischer Kollege Christer Fuglesang verließen die Raumstation um 20:31 UTC über die amerikanische ISS-Luftschleuse Quest. Zur Vorbereitung dieser EVA gehörte das während des letzten Shuttle-Fluges praktizierte „Kampieren“, wobei die beiden Raumfahrer die Nacht in der Luftschleuse verbrachten (Näheres im STS-115-Artikel)., Nachdem die Schutzverkleidung von der P5-Struktur entfernt wurde, manövrierte der ISS-Greifarm das neue Bauteil an seine vorgesehene Position, vorbei an der bereits vorhandenen Struktur der Raumstation, die nur wenig Spielraum ließ. Dabei konnten Suni Williams und Joanie Higginbotham, das „Bedienungspersonal“ des Roboterarms, nur auf Zuruf agieren, denn sie hatten kein Videobild zur Verfügung. Dann schraubten Fuglesang und Curbeam den 1,9-Tonnen-Aluminiumadapter am P4-Solarmodul fest. Anschließend schlossen die beiden „Aussteiger“ die Strom- und Datenverbindungen zwischen P4 und P5 an und wech: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Deutsche Raumfahrt, Discovery, Europäische Weltraumorganisation, NASA, Raumfahrtmission 2006, Schwedische Raumfahrt, STS-116, Raumfähre Discovery, ISS, Internationale Raumstation"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Amateurfunk-Relaisstandort, Aussichtsturm in Berlin, Bauwerk der Moderne in Berlin, Berlin-Westend, Deutsche Funkturm, Erbaut in den 1920er Jahren, Gastronomiebetrieb (Berlin), Heinrich Straumer, Historische Sendeanlage, Kulturdenkmal (Berlin)], Der Berliner Funkturm, (umgangssprachlich als \\"Langer Lulatsch\\" bekannt) ist ein 146,7Meter hoher Stahlfachwerkturm auf dem Messegelände im Berliner Ortsteil Westend und eines der Wahrzeichen der Stadt. Der vom Architekten Heinrich Straumer entworfene Sendeturm wurde 1926 zur \\"3.Großen Deutschen Funk-Ausstellung Berlin\\" in Betrieb genommen und ist damit 43Jahre älter als der Berliner Fernsehturm am Alexanderplatz. Seit 1966 steht der Funkturm unter Denkmalschutz., Das öffentlich zugängliche Bauwerk besitzt auf 50Metern Höhe ein Turmrestaurant sowie einen Aussichtsbereich an der Turmspitze. In der Geschichte des Hörfunks in Deutschland steht er an hervorgehobener Position. Vom Berliner Funkturm wurden ab 1926 Sendungen des Hörfunks und ab 1929 zunächst versuchsweise Fernseh-Testsendungen ausgestrahlt. Auch die weltweit erste Fernsehsendung kam 1932 vom Berliner Funkturm. Im Laufe der 1970er und 1980er Jahre nahm seine Bedeutung als Sendeturm ab und seit 1989 strahlt er nur noch Amateur-, Land- und BOS-Funk aus. Eigentümer des Berliner Funkturms ist das Land Berlin, Betreiber des Restaurants und der Aussichtsplattform ist die Capital Catering GmbH, eine hundertprozentige Tochter der \\"Messe Berlin GmbH\\"., Geschichte., Planung., Der Funkturm war Teil des Konzeptes zum Bau des Hauses der deutschen Funkindustrie. Im Sommer 1924 beschrieb der Syndikus des Verbandes der Radio-Industrie e.V., Berthold Cohn, die Lage so:, Die Planungen für einen reinen Sendeturm gingen auf die Forderung für einen Antennenträger in Witzleben zurück, der die Sender Vox-Haus und BerlinII am Magdeburger Platz ersetzen sollte. Die Geschichte des Hörfunks in Deutschland hatte in den 1920er Jahren erst begonnen und der Bau von adäquaten Sendetürmen galt mangels Erfahrung als Pionierarbeit. Da die Höhenlage des Witzlebener Gebietes nur durch den Kreuzberg überragt wurde, genügte es, die Antenne etwa 120–130Meter über dem Boden aufzuhängen. Daraus resultierte, dass der zu projektierende Turm auf eine Höhe von 138Metern festgesetzt wurde. Die ursprüngliche Idee, einen stählernen Turm mit einem Aluminiumring zu errichten, wurde verworfen., Der damalige Direktor des Berliner Messe-Amtes Alfred Schick plädierte allerdings für den Ausbau der Funkanlage vom reinen Sender zum Aussichtsturm mit Restaurantgeschoss. Die eigentliche Idee für das Turmrestaurant kam vom Journalisten Karl Vetter, der zu jener Zeit auch einer der Direktoren des Messeamtes war. Vetter verhinderte später auch den Abriss des Funkturms, der ins Gespräch kam, nachdem der Antennenmast technisch überholt war., Bau., Als der Auftrag zum Bau am 8.November 1924 vergeben worden war, konnte nach Ende der 1.Großen Deutschen Funkausstellung, die vom 4. bis zum 14.Dezember 1924 dauerte, mit dem Bau begonnen werden. Zunächst wurde ein 120Meter hoher Stahlgittermast errichtet, der als Kran fungierte. Der Turm selbst wurde bis zum 15.April 1925 aufgestellt. Dann folgte der weitere Ausbau, der sich bis zum Frühjahr 1926 hinzog. Die Bauabnahme fand schließlich am 26.April desselben Jahres statt., Der Architekt Straumer war für den Entwurf der beiden Besucherplattformen (Aussichts- und Restaurantetage) und das Empfangs- und Wartehäuschen am Boden verantwortlich. Die bauliche Leitung hatten die Ingenieure Heiligenthal und Behrens. Neben der Auflage, eine vollkommene Betriebssicherheit zu garantieren, war das Turmbauprojekt auch einem enormen Kostendruck ausgesetzt. Um die Kosten so gering wie möglich zu halten, wurde auf gestalterische Zierelemente wie beim Eiffelturm verzichtet. Das reduzierte die Masse, lässt das Bauwerk aber auch feingliedrig wirken. In insgesamt 140 Konstruktionszeichnungen wurden alle technischen Details dargestellt. Der Innenraum des Restaurants wurde von dem der \\"Wiener Werkstätte\\" angehörenden Künstler Victor Lurjé gestaltet. Auf den Vertäfelungen aus kaukasischem Nussholz schuf Lurjé kunstvolle Intarsien, die Decke wurde in Rippenstuck ausgeführt., Die Bauarbeiten konnten ohne tödliche Unfälle abgeschlossen werden., Vier Tage vor der Eröffnung entstand durch Lötarbeiten ein Schwelbrand, der durch den Aufzugsschacht auf das Restaurantdach des Funkturms gelangte. Da die Holzkonstruktion noch nicht vollständig mit Zink verkleidet war, konnten starke Winde das Feuer anfachen. Die Bauarbeiter konnten allerdings das Feuer, noch vor dem Eintreffen der Feuerwehr, mit Handfeuerlöschern erfolgreich bekämpfen und damit eine Katastrophe abwenden., Baukosten und Eröffnung., Die Baukosten des Berliner Funkturms wurden ursprünglich auf 180.000Mark festgesetzt. Dafür erteilte am 8.Dezember 1924 die \\"Gemeinnützige Berliner Messe-Aufbau G.m.b.H.\\" einen Auftrag an \\"Hein, Lehmann &amp;Co.\\", eine Eisenkonstruktionen-, Brücken- und Signalbaugesellschaft. Aufgrund der Vergrößerung der Fundamente und der gegenseitigen, unterirdischen Verankerung sowie weiterer Änderungen entstanden Mehrkosten. Abweichend vom Auftrag erhielt die obere Treppe ein günstigeres Steigungsverhältnis, das Geländer wurde erhöht, die Diagonalen verstärkt und Horizontalverbände nachträglich verlegt. So ergab die Endabrechnung Baukosten in Höhe von 203.660Mark (kaufkraftbereinigt in heutiger Währung rund Euro)., Am 3. September 1926 wurde der Berliner Funkturm in Anwesenheit von Reichsinnenminister Wilhelm Külz, den Politikern Johannes Bell und Heinrich Haslinde, dem damaligen Berliner Oberbürgermeister Gustav Böß und rund 1000 geladenen Gästen feierlich eröffnet und für den Publikumsverkehr freigegeben. Der Vorsitzende der Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft, der Hochfrequenztechniker und Chefsprecher der Berliner Funkstunde Hans Bredow, trug ein Weihegedicht vor, dessen erste Zeilen folgende waren:, &lt;poem style=\\"margin-left:2.8em;\\"&gt;, „Hoch vom Berliner Himmel umblaut,, Ist ein stählerner Turm gebaut., Steil in die Berliner Luft,, Umleuchtet vom letzten Sommerduft., Im neuen Berlin im Berliner Wind,, Das allerjüngste Berliner Kind!, Berliner Jahre werden gehn:, Sturm wird kommen der Turm wird stehn!“, &lt;/poem&gt;, Das Bauwerk war– ähnlich wie der Eiffelturm während der Weltausstellung 1889 in Paris– eine Attraktion der 3.Großen Deutschen Funkausstellung in Berlin. Die Abendausgabe des \\"Berliner Tageblattes\\" schrieb am Eröffnungstag:, Mit 138Metern war der Berliner Funkturm gleichzeitig der erste und damit höchste Sende- und Aussichtsturm im Deutschen Reich der Weimarer Republik., Betrieb in den ersten Jahren., Die Berliner \\"Carl Flohr AG\\" installierte die erste Aufzugsanlage hinauf zur Aussichtsplattform. Mit 120Metern Förderhöhe war diese der höchste elektrische Lift im Deutschen Reich. Der 20PS (14,7kW) starke Elektromotor befand sich an der Spitze des Turms und ermöglichte bis zu zehn Personen die Fahrt zur Aussichtsetage. Die Geschwindigkeit war mit 1,5Meter pro Sekunde relativ gering und wurde kurze Zeit später auf 2,5Meter pro Sekunde erhöht., Da in den 1920er Jahren die Berliner Wasserwerke das Wasser nur bis zu einer Gebäudehöhe von etwa 40Metern pumpen konnten, mussten im Turmhaus eigens für die Wasserversorgung des Funkturms zwei Hochdruck-Kreiselpumpen installiert werden, die einander ablösten., Die Restaurant-Etage wurde ursprünglich über die Niederdruck-Dampfheizungsanlage betrieben, die aus der Radio-Messehalle angezapft wurde. Damit war auch bei strengem Frost eine angenehme Raumtemperatur gewährleistet. Ein installiertes Fernthermometer zeigte dem Heizer am Kessel, ob die Befeuerungsleistung ausreichend war. Auch das Belüftungssystem war für die damalige Zeit komfortabel. Über zwei elektrische Schleuderlüfter konnten fünfmal stündlich die 600Kubikmeter Luft vollständig umgewälzt werden. Abzugsklappen im Restaurantdach sorgten dafür, dass sich der Zigarrenqualm im Speisesaal nicht sammelte. Da der Turm nicht nur beheizt, sondern auch gekühlt werden sollte, befand sich zu Anfang eine 1,3PS starke Kältemaschine im Dachboden des Restaurants. Als Kälteträger wurde konzentriertes Salzwasser verwendet, das durch ein Leitungssystem in die Küche und an die Theke transportiert wurde., In den Jahren 1926–1930 wurden ein Sender von Telefunken als Reserve sowie zusätzlich zwei Sender der C.LorenzAG installiert. Da zur damaligen Zeit die Leistung der Sender auf maximal 1,5kW begrenzt war, mussten weitere Sender über Frequenzwechsel aufgebaut werden. Das machte häufige Änderungen an den Antennen nötig. Bekannt geworden ist die Rede Albert Einsteins am 22.August 1930 zur Eröffnung der \\"7.Deutschen Funkausstellung und Phonoschau\\" am Fuße des Funkturms, die im Rundfunk übertragen wurde., Von seiner Eröffnung bis 1928 verzeichnete der Berliner Funkturm 500.000 Besucher. Mit dem ersten Faltauto, dem, erklomm der deutsche Ingenieur und Erfinder Engelbert Zaschka im selben Jahr die oberste Plattform des Berliner Funkturms., Ähnlich wie am Eiffelturm diente der Funkturm in seinen Anfangsjahren als überdimensionaler Werbeträger. An der dem Messedamm zugewandten Seite bildeten auf der Eingangsseite des Funkturmrestaurants 4000Glühlampen eine Matrixanzeige-Reklamefläche, die wahlweise statische oder laufende Schriftzüge darstellen konnte., Brandkatastrophe und Kriegszeit., Am 19.August 1935 brach gegen 20:30Uhr in der alten Ausstellungshalle4 ein Brand aus. Durch Windeinfluss breitete sich das Feuer aus. Die Installation des Funkturms erlitt durch die Hitzeentwicklung einen Kurzschluss; aber auch die Ostseite des Restaurantbereichs fing Feuer. Gleichzeitig hielt der Wind das Feuer in Schach, sodass schlimmere Schäden verhindert wurden. Die Funkhalle brannte jedoch völlig nieder. Gegen 22Uhr konnten die mit 50Feuerwehrfahrzeugen angerückten Löschkräfte das Feuer umkreisen und Schlimmeres verhindern. Da der Brand nach Messeschließung ausbrach und sich nur das Standpersonal um diese Zeit in der Halle4 befand, kamen bei diesem Großbrand lediglich drei Menschen ums Leben., Nach dem Brand wurde der 80Meter hohe Behelfsmast entfernt und eine einfache Schrägdrahtantenne von der Funkturmspitze zu einem auf dem Dach des Sendergebäudes angebrachten Durchführungsisolator gespannt. Mit dieser Maßnahme war der Sender Witzleben bereits in der Stadtmitte Berlins kaum noch, im Ostteil gar nicht mehr zu empfangen. Allerdings war der Sender durch die Inbetriebnahme des Senders Tegel entbehrlich geworden., Während des Zweiten Weltkriegs dient: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Amateurfunk-Relaisstandort, Aussichtsturm, Bauwerk der Moderne, Berlin-Westend, Deutsche Funkturm, 1920er Jahre, Gastronomiebetrieb, Heinrich Straumer, Historische Sendeanlage, Kulturdenkmal"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Abkürzung, Gulag, Politik (Sowjetunion), Recht (Sowjetunion), Sowjetismus, Stalinismus], Das Kürzel Gulag bezeichnet das Netz von Straf- und Arbeitslagern in der Sowjetunion, im weiteren Sinn steht es für die Gesamtheit des sowjetischen Zwangsarbeitssystems, das neben Lagern und Zwangsarbeitskolonien auch Sonderlager des MWD, Spezialgefängnisse, Zwangsarbeitspflichten ohne Haft sowie in nachstalinistischer Zeit ebenfalls einige psychiatrische Kliniken als Haftverbüßungsorte umfasste. Im weitesten Sinn ist das gesamte sowjetische Repressionssystem gemeint., \\"Gulag\\" beziehungsweise \\"GULag\\" steht im Sprachgebrauch der sowjetischen Behörden für (abgekürzt, betont auf der letzten Silbe) oder offiziell auch, transkribiert \\"Glawnoje uprawlenije isprawitelno-trudowych lagerej\\" \\"i kolonij\\", übersetzt „Hauptverwaltung der Besserungsarbeitslager und -kolonien“. Zunächst war diese Behörde der Geheimpolizei GPU der RSFSR zugeordnet. Nach Gründung der Sowjetunion 1922 wurde die Geheimpolizei nach dem sowjetrussischen Modell der GPU auf alle damaligen Unionsrepubliken ausgeweitet und 1923 in OGPU umbenannt. 1934 wurde die OGPU dem NKWD, dem sowjetischen Innenministerium, eingegliedert., Von 1930 bis 1953 waren in den Lagern mindestens 18 Millionen Menschen inhaftiert. Mehr als 2,7 Millionen starben im Lager oder in der Verbannung. In den letzten Lebensjahren Stalins erreichte der Gulag mit rund 2,5 Millionen den Höchststand an Insassen. Hinzu kamen in diesem Zeitraum rund sechs Millionen Personen, die als „Sondersiedler“ oder „Arbeitssiedler“ zum Verbleib an ihrem Arbeitsort verbannt waren. Während des Zweiten Weltkrieges und in den Nachkriegsjahren hielt die Sowjetunion ferner rund vier bis sechs Millionen Kriegsgefangene in Lagern des GUPWI (, transkribiert \\"Glawnoje uprawlenije po delam wojennoplennych i internirowannych\\", übersetzt „Hauptverwaltung für Angelegenheiten von Kriegsgefangenen und Internierten“) fest und forderte von ihnen Zwangsarbeit. Unmittelbar nach Kriegsende kamen 700.000 Insassen von Filtrationslagern hinzu. Fachleute gehen heute davon aus, dass insgesamt rund 28,7 bis 32 Millionen Menschen in der Sowjetunion Zwangsarbeit zu verrichten hatten., Historische Entwicklung., Hintergrund und Vorgeschichte., Ssylka und Katorga., \\"Im Strafwesen des Russischen Reiches nahmen Verbannungen (ссы́лка – ssylka) und das System der Katorga einen wichtigen Platz ein. Die Katorga wies dabei eine Reihe typischer Anzeichen von Arbeitslagern auf: Verurteilungen, harte körperliche Arbeit ohne besondere Fachkenntnisse, einfachste Behausungen und Arbeitszwang. Sie spielte sich überwiegend in den dünn besiedelten, lebensfeindlichen, aber rohstoffreichen Regionen Sibiriens und im russischen Fernen Osten ab. Als Inbegriff des Katorga-Systems galt im 19.Jahrhundert die Strafkolonie auf der entlegenen Insel Sachalin. Die Katorga-Häftlinge, die zu mehrjährigen oder lebenslangen Strafen verurteilt worden waren, arbeiteten häufig in Bergwerken und in der Holzwirtschaft. Als Strafkategorien betrafen Ssylka und Katorga verurteilte politische Gegner wie zum Beispiel die Dekabristen und Narodniki oder die Bolschewiki, aber auch Schwerkriminelle.\\", Von 1824 bis 1889 wurden 720.000 Menschen nach Sibirien verbannt. Im Vergleich dazu blieb die Katorga eine seltenere Strafe, 1906 waren von ihr rund 6.000 Personen betroffen, 1916 lag diese Zahl bei 28.600. Literarisch setzten sich Fjodor Dostojewski \\"(Aufzeichnungen aus einem Totenhaus)\\", Anton Tschechow \\"(Die Insel Sachalin)\\" und Lew Tolstoi (\\"Auferstehung\\") mit Verbannung und Zwangsarbeit auseinander und machten damit die fernen Haftverbüßungsorte im europäischen Russland bekannt., Nach der Februarrevolution 1917 wurde die Katorga-Strafe abgeschafft. Eine Neuauflage erlebte die wiedereingeführte harte Strafvollzugsform \\"katorga\\" (\\"katorshnye raboty, KRT\\") in Form der sogenannten Stalin-Katorga ab 1943 bis zur Etablierung der Sonderlager des MWD 1948. Die Stalinschen Katorga-Lager waren Lager mit besonders scharfem Regime sowohl für Politische als auch für Kriminelle., Lager zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts., Neben russischen Bestrafungstraditionen zählt auch die internationale Entwicklung des (Isolierungs-)Lagers zu den Wurzeln des Gulag. Im Kubanischen Unabhängigkeitskrieg (1895 bis 1898) richteten spanische Militärs sogenannte Konzentrationslager \\"(campos de reconcentración)\\" ein, um die kubanische Zivilbevölkerung von Aufständischen zu trennen, die für die Souveränität der Insel kämpften. Im Zweiten Burenkrieg (1899 bis 1902) zwangen britische Militärs burische Frauen und Kinder sowie im Burengebiet lebende Afrikaner in \\"concentration camps\\". Deutsche Kolonialtruppen isolierten auf Geheiß der Reichsregierung unter Bernhard von Bülow von 1904 bis 1908 in Deutsch-Südwestafrika Angehörige der Herero und Nama in Konzentrationslagern., Kriegsgefangenenlager im Ersten Weltkrieg., Der Erste Weltkrieg sorgte für die Zunahme von Lagern. Die Kriegsgefangenenlager waren dabei militarisiert, die Lagerinfrastruktur und die Arbeitskraft der Gefangenen wurden intensiv genutzt, die Lagerarchitekturen glichen sich an., Der Krieg rechtfertigte nicht nur auf den Schlachtfeldern ein ausgeprägtes Freund-Feind-Denken. Auch innerhalb der kriegführenden Staaten grassierte die Suche nach Feinden, Spionen und potenziellen Kollaborateuren, beispielsweise im Russischen Reich. Die Erfahrungen mit Lagern waren auch dort allgegenwärtig: Internierte Soldaten des Russischen Reiches kannten sie, ebenso ihre Angehörigen. Aber auch Arbeitgeber, die die Arbeitskraft von Kriegsgefangenen der russischen Lager nutzten, waren mit den Lagern vertraut, gleiches galt für Nachbarn sowie für das Verwaltungs- und Wachpersonal derartiger Einrichtungen., Ursprung und Entwicklung bis zum Deutsch-Sowjetischen Krieg., Revolution, Bürgerkrieg und Terror., In den Wirren, die auf die Februar- und die Oktoberrevolution folgten, breitete sich Gewalt in der Zivilgesellschaft Russlands aus. Die Bolschewiki befeuerten sie, indem sie mit Bezugnahme auf die Jakobiner der Französischen Revolution nach dem Vorbild des \\"Grande Terreur\\" auf Terror setzten. Nachdem die Linken Sozialrevolutionäre die gemeinsame Regierung mit den Bolschewiki verlassen hatten, weil sie die Unterzeichnung des Friedensvertrags von Brest-Litowsk (3.März 1918) ablehnten, ließen die Bolschewiki Anhänger ihres früheren Partners in Gefängnisse und Konzentrationslager einliefern. Häufig waren diese Konzentrationslager vorher Kriegsgefangenenlager gewesen – die militärische Institution wandelte sich damit in eine politische., Im August 1918, der Russische Bürgerkrieg tobte bereits seit Monaten, griff Lenin den Terminus \\"Konzentrationslager\\" auf. Er forderte Terror gegen „Kulaken“, „Popen“ und Mitglieder der Weißen Armee; „zwielichtige Elemente“ seien in ein Konzentrationslager zu sperren. Zu zentralen Organen terroristischer Gewalt entwickelten sich seit 1917 die Tscheka, danach die GPU beziehungsweise ab 1923 deren Nachfolgeorganisation, die OGPU. Nach dem Attentat auf Lenin am 30.August 1918, ausgeführt durch die Anarchistin und Sozialrevolutionärin Fanny Kaplan, legitimierte ein Beschluss des Rates der Volkskommissare vom 5.September 1918 die systematische Anwendung von Rotem Terror gegen „Klassenfeinde“ und deren Verbringung in Konzentrationslager. 1921 gab es 48 derartige Lager in 43 Gouvernements. Neben früheren Kriegsgefangenenlagern fanden auch Klöster als Konzentrationslager Verwendung., Während und nach dem Russischen Bürgerkrieg war der Einsatz sogenannter Arbeitsarmeen für die weitere Entwicklung des Gulag-Systems als Wirtschaftsfaktor von nicht unerheblicher Bedeutung. Es handelte sich dabei um eine militarisierte Form der Zwangsarbeit, der Soldaten der Roten Armee zur Behebung der negativen wirtschaftlichen Folgen des Kriegskommunismus unterworfen wurden. Bereits Anfang der 1920er Jahre in der 1.Periode der Arbeitsarmeen – von 1942 bis 1946 gab es sie erneut – sind Parallelen zwischen den Arbeitsarmeen und dem Gulag deutlich erkennbar. Gemeinsame Merkmale waren Arbeitszwang beziehungsweise Zwangsarbeit, der massenhafte Einsatz von Arbeitskräften zur Schwerstarbeit, militärische Kommandowirtschaft, ein Prämiensystem für die Erfüllung von Arbeitsnormen sowie daran gekoppelte Essensrationen., Solowezki., Obgleich die Bolschewiki behaupteten, dass Gefängnisse und Verbannungen im Sozialismus und erst recht im Kommunismus keine Zukunft hätten, blieben diese Repressionsinstrumente auch nach dem Bürgerkrieg in Gebrauch. Im Mittelpunkt ideologischer Konzepte zur Haftgestaltung standen zunächst „Erziehung“ und „Umschmiedung“ \\"(perekowka)\\": Aus Straffälligen sollten Bürger werden, die Gesellschaft und Staat der Sowjetunion begrüßten. Der Gedanke der „Besserungsarbeit“ nahm hier breiten Raum ein, er dominierte zu Lenins Lebzeiten konkurrierende Modelle, die auf Ausbeutung der Arbeitskraft von Häftlingen abzielten. 1924 erfolgte eine erste Kodifizierung der „Besserungsarbeit“: Im Strafsystem sollte Arbeit eine zentrale Rolle bei der Erziehung übernehmen. Im Unterschied zu westlichen Haftkonzepten floss die soziale Herkunft des Delinquenten in die Art und Dauer der Strafe ein; in Urteil und Haft ersetzte der Klassenansatz den Gleichheitssatz., Auf den Solowezki-Inseln im Weißen Meer, rund 160 Kilometer südlich des Polarkreises, entstand die „Urzelle des späteren sowjetischen Lagersystems der Stalinzeit“, das Sonderlager Solowezki. Ausgehend vom dortigen Solowezki-Kloster entwickelte sich ab 1923 der Lagerkomplex der „Solowezki-Lager zur besonderen Verwendung“ (SLON). Bis zur Schließung im Jahr 1939 saßen hier mehr als 840.000 Personen ein. Der Lagerkomplex war für Schwerkriminelle und politische Häftlinge bestimmt. Letztere wurden zu diesem Zweck aus den sogenannten „Politisolatoren“ (Spezialhaftstätten für politische Gefangene) des Festlandes dorthin verlegt. In den 1920er Jahren saßen im SLON durchschnittlich einige Tausend Häftlinge ein. „Politische“ (Angehörige linker Parteien, Anarchisten) und „Konterrevolutionäre“ (Überlebende des Kronstädter Matrosenaufstands, Vertreter des alten Regimes wie weißgardistische Offiziere, Geistliche, Nonnen etc.) stellten die Mehrheit der Insassen, „Kriminelle“ waren in der Minderheit. Bis 1928/1929 gaben die „Politischen“ unter den Häftlingen den Ton an, anschließend übernahmen die „Kriminellen“ die Herrschaft unter den Gefangenen. Zum Alltag im Lager zählten prügelnde Wachmannschaften, Schikanen, Folterpraktiken sowie Vergewaltigungen und sexuelle Nötigungen weiblicher Insassen., Das SLON: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Gulag, Sowjetunion, Zwangsarbeit, Lager, NKWD, Katorga, Gefangene, Arbeitsarmeen, Solowezki, Repressionssystem"},{"prompt":"I'm creating a group name and it needs to have the word 'Four' in it I want there to be some sort of religious undertone It can be from Western or Eastern religions I.e.

Flug einer US-Raumfähre zur Internationalen Raumstation (ISS) transportierte die S3/S4-Struktur zur ISS., Der Start musste auf Grund von starken Beschädigungen am Außentank von Mitte März auf Anfang Juni 2007 verschoben werden., Mannschaft., ISS-Crew Hinflug., ISS-Expedition 15/ISS-Expedition 16, ISS-Crew Rückflug., ISS-Expedition 14/ISS-Expedition 15, Missionsüberblick., Der Start war ursprünglich für den 15. März 2007 vorgesehen, musste aber wegen eines schweren Hagelsturms, der das Shuttle am Tank und einige der Hitzeschutzkacheln beschädigt hatte, verschoben werden. Durch die erforderlichen Reparaturarbeiten konnte der Start erst am 8. Juni erfolgen, bei dem erstmals seit vier Jahren die Startrampe 39A genutzt wurde., STS-117 brachte das S3/S4-Element zur Internationalen Raumstation. Das Bauteil besteht aus der Gitterstruktur S3 und dem Solarzellenträger S4. Die Solarpaneele wurden nach der Installation ausgefahren. Außerdem wurde der zweite Flügel des Solarmoduls P6 eingefahren, um ihn später an seine endgültige Position bringen zu können., Für die geplanten Arbeiten waren ursprünglich drei Weltraumausstiege vorgesehen. Während des Fluges wurde jedoch ein vierter Ausstieg hinzugefügt, um Beschädigungen am Orbiter zu reparieren., Vorbereitungen., Reaktivierung der Startrampe 39A., STS-117 war die erste Mission nach über vier Jahren, die von der Startrampe 39A aus erfolgte. Diese wurde zuletzt beim Start der Mission STS-107 benutzt, die mit dem Absturz der Raumfähre Columbia und dem Tod der gesamten Mannschaft endete., Ende 2006 wurde damit begonnen, die Rampe wieder für den Startbetrieb herzurichten. Dabei wurde festgestellt, dass es größere Schäden gab, als man angenommen hatte. Deshalb war lange Zeit nicht sicher, ob Pad 39A rechtzeitig für STS-117 fertig sein würde. Wäre dies nicht der Fall gewesen, hätte man von Pad 39B starten können. Auf dieser Rampe sollten aber in den folgenden Monaten die Umbauten für die Testflüge der neuen Ares-I-Rakete beginnen, deshalb hätte ein Shuttle-Start von dieser Rampe zu weiteren Verspätungen im Constellation-Programm geführt. Da die Rampe 39B für eine Rettungsmission der STS-125-Mission bereitstehen musste, durften an der eigentlichen Startanlage keine Veränderungen vorgenommen werden. Nur kleinere Veränderungen am Launch Complex sowie der Bau von drei Blitzableitern waren daher erlaubt. Mitte Januar stellte sich heraus, dass die Rampe 39A rechtzeitig einsatzbereit sein würde., Ende Januar 2007 wurden am Pad 39A Tests durchgeführt. Unter anderem wurde am 29. Januar die RSS-Zugangsplattform von der Park- in die Arbeitsposition und wieder zurückgefahren. Tags darauf wurden die Pumpen für die Treibstoffe in Betrieb genommen. Diese Überprüfungen waren erforderlich, weil die Startrampe seit STS-107 im Januar 2003 nicht mehr verwendet worden war., Vorbereitung des Orbiters., Nach dem Ende ihrer letzten Mission wurde die Atlantis am 21. September 2006 in die Orbiter Processing Facility gefahren. Bei der obligatorischen Nachkontrolle der Raumfähre wurde Anfang Oktober entdeckt, dass während des STS-115-Fluges ein Mikrometeorit den Radiator der geöffneten rechten Laderaumtür durchschlagen hatte. Der Fremdkörper hinterließ ein Loch, das auf der Eintrittsseite 2,7mm und auf der Austrittsseite 0,8mm maß. Der Radiator wurde in einem Bereich von 2,5cm um das Loch beschädigt und war kurze Zeit später repariert., Der Anfang Dezember 2006 begonnene Zusammenbau der Feststoffraketen im Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB), die aus jeweils vier Segmenten bestanden, die aufeinander gesetzt und miteinander verbunden wurden, wurde einen Monat später abgeschlossen. Ende Dezember 2006 traf auch der Außentank in Florida ein., Nachdem die Montage des Außentanks zwischen die Feststoffbooster am 20. Januar 2007 abgeschlossen war, wurde die Atlantis am 7. Februar zum VAB gerollt. Tags darauf wurde die Fähre mit Außentank und Feststoffraketen verbunden., Am 15. Februar wurde die Raumfähre zum Pad 39A gefahren. Dieser sogenannte Rollout hatte um einen Tag verschoben werden müssen, weil ein Sensor in einer der Feststoffraketen bei Tests ungewöhnliche Werte geliefert hatte. Die Messsonde, die den Kammerdruck überwachte, wurde an der Startrampe ausgewechselt., Raumfähre durch Gewitter beschädigt., Am 26. Februar brach ein unerwartet heftiges Gewitter mit Hagelschlag über das Kennedy Space Center (KSC) herein. Dabei wurden Teile des auf der Rampe stehenden Shuttles beschädigt. Erste Inspektionen ergaben allein am Außentank durch die teilweise golfballgroßen Hagelkörner etwa 7.000 Beschädigungen an der weichen Isolierung, von denen zehn Prozent als reparaturbedürftig eingestuft wurden. Auch mindestens 26 Hitzeschutzkacheln im Bereich der linken Tragfläche der Atlantis wurden in Mitleidenschaft gezogen. Dies war der größte Hagelschaden in der Geschichte der Shuttle-Flüge. Den bisherigen Rekord hielt nach Angaben der NASA ein Hagelsturm vom Mai 1999, der eine dreiwöchige Verschiebung der Mission STS-96 erzwang. Damals trug der Außentank über 600 „Beulen“ davon., Wie geplant kamen am 27. Februar die Verantwortlichen des Shuttle-Programms am KSC zur traditionellen FRR-Flugbereitschaftsabnahme zusammen. Eigentlich sollte während des Flight Readiness Review die Flugtauglichkeit aller Systeme attestiert werden. Stattdessen gab Wayne Hale, der Leiter des Shuttle-Programms, bekannt, dass die Atlantis wegen der Hagelschäden zu Reparaturarbeiten und weiteren Untersuchungen zurück in das VAB transportiert werden müsse. Erst dort sei eine genaue Inspektion möglich. Vor allem die Schäden am orangefarbenen Tank müssten ausgebessert werden. Der vorgesehene Starttermin, der 15. März, wurde abgesagt, ein neues Datum nicht genannt., Sechs Tage nach dem Hagelsturm erfolgte am 4. März der siebenstündige Rücktransport zur Montagehalle. Es war der 17. sogenannte Rollback des Shuttle-Programms. Der Letzte fand zwei Jahre zuvor statt, als die Raumfähre Discovery im Mai 2005 einen neuen Außentank für die Mission STS-114 erhielt., Reparatur der Hagelschäden., Fünf Tage nach der Ankunft der Fähre in der Montagehalle gab die NASA bekannt, dass eine Reparatur des externen Tanks vor Ort möglich sei. Eine abschließende Beurteilung über den genauen Umfang der Hagelschäden am Außentank könne zwar noch nicht gegeben werden, aber mit kleinen Ausbesserungsarbeiten wurde bereits begonnen. Es wurde befürchtet, dass bei irreparablen Schäden der Tank sogar hätte ausgewechselt werden müssen. Dies hätte eine Demontage von Orbiter und Feststoffraketen vom Tank erfordert und eine längere Wartezeit bedeutet. Die NASA erklärte weiter, dass die Inspektion der Feststoffraketen bereits beendet und dass 28 Hitzeschutzkacheln der Atlantis in Mitleidenschaft gezogen wurden. Ein Großteil davon wurde bereits repariert., Am 15. März gab Wayne Hale, der Leiter des Shuttle-Programms, grünes Licht, mit den Reparaturen am Außentank (ET) zu beginnen. Fast zwei Wochen dauerten die vorbereitenden Arbeiten. Zunächst mussten im VAB Plattformen aufgestellt werden, um den gesamten ET auf Schäden untersuchen zu können. An der Spitze, wo die meisten Hagelschäden zu verzeichnen waren, wurde eine spezielle Paste aufgetragen, um auch kleinste Risse sichtbar zu machen. Parallel dazu wurden im Herstellerwerk des Tanks Reparaturtechniken entwickelt, denn wegen der umfangreichen Funde an der ET-Spitze reichte dort ein herkömmliches Verfahren (verspachteln und glätten) nicht aus., Nach einem Treffen der NASA-Verantwortlichen wurde auf einer Telefon-Pressekonferenz am 21. März die weitere Vorgehensweise dargelegt. Obwohl die Reparatur des Tanks Fortschritte machte, wurde mit einem Start frühestens Mitte Mai gerechnet. Während bei einem Großteil der Hagelschäden im unteren und mittleren Bereich des Außentanks kein Ausbesserungsbedarf bestand oder diese durch Verspachteln repariert werden konnten, waren die Beschädigungen an der Spitze gravierend. Allein dort wurden rund 1.600 Beulen lokalisiert – auf engstem Raum und viele ineinander übergehend. Diese Sektion musste vollständig abgetragen und mit Sprühschaum von Hand aufgebracht werden. Weil diese Stelle des Tanks während des Starts den größten aerodynamischen Belastungen ausgesetzt ist, wurden noch einige Tests durchgeführt., Ausbau der Haupttriebwerke., Die NASA gab am 10. April bekannt, dass alle Testergebnisse vorlägen und einstimmig beschlossen worden sei, den Außentank nicht auszuwechseln. Trotzdem behalte man sich die Tauschoption offen, falls der reparierte Tank später doch als „nicht flugtauglich“ eingestuft würde. Der Atlantis-Start sei nicht vor dem 8. Juni möglich, um den Technikern genügend Zeit zu geben, die Hagelschäden auszubessern, erklärte Shuttle-Manager Wayne Hale im Anschluss an eine Besprechung über das weitere Vorgehen., Am 30. April wurde im VAB mit dem Ausbau der drei Haupttriebwerke begonnen. Es wurden mögliche Verunreinigungen in den Kraftstoffleitungen vermutet, weil bei Wartungsarbeiten in der Schwesterfähre Discovery Silikonrückstände entdeckt wurden. Mit Silikon werden seit einigen Jahren Abdrücke der Treibstoffleitungen angefertigt, um Risse in der Kraftstoffversorgung aufzuspüren. Die Techniker hatten gewartet bis die Standardreparaturarbeiten im unteren Bereich des Außentanks abgeschlossen und die Zugangsgerüste abgebaut waren – diese standen teilweise sehr dicht am Tank. Beim Entfernen der Triebwerke parallel zu den Arbeiten am Tank hätte die Gefahr bestanden, diesen erneut durch Kontakt mit den Plattformen zu beschädigen, weil der gesamte Shuttle etwas schwankt, wenn die schweren Motoren ausgebaut werden., Nach einer Woche waren alle Triebwerke wieder in den Orbiter installiert. Während ein Aggregat in einwandfreiem Zustand war, wurde im Backbordtriebwerk (SSME-2) ein drei Millimeter großes Silikonstückchen gefunden. Auch in Motor Nr. 1 wurde ein kleiner Fremdpartikel entdeckt. Wegen eines zuvor angesetzten Wechsels einer Turbopumpe, wurde SSME-2 in die Triebwerkswartungshalle überführt – die beiden anderen Aggregate blieben im VAB., Vorgezogener Besatzungswechsel., Wegen der mehrmonatigen Verschiebung der Mission STS-117 gab die NASA Ende April 2007 bekannt, den erst für den nächsten Shuttle-Flug geplanten Austausch der amerikanischen Bordingenieure auf der: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Jahrhundert), Forschung in Berlin, Forschungsprojekt in Deutschland, Geschichte der Luftfahrt (Berlin), Meteorologische Beobachtungseinrichtung, Meteorologisches oder klimatologisches Forschungsprojekt, Veranstaltung (Luftfahrt)], Als Berliner wissenschaftliche Luftfahrten wird eine Serie von 65 bemannten und 29 unbemannten Ballonaufstiegen bezeichnet, die in den Jahren 1888 bis 1899 vom Deutschen Verein zur Förderung der Luftschifffahrt zur Erforschung der freien Atmosphäre durchgeführt wurden. Organisator der Fahrten war Richard Aßmann, Professor am Berliner Meteorologischen Institut, der auch die wichtigsten der eingesetzten Messinstrumente entwickelt hatte. Die Durchführung lag vor allem in den Händen des Militärluftschiffers Hans Groß und des Meteorologen Arthur Berson. 1894 stieg Berson mit dem Ballon \\"Phönix\\" bis in eine Höhe von 9.155 Metern – die größte, die ein Mensch bis dahin erreicht hatte., Vorgeschichte., Der Stand der Meteorologie in den 1880er Jahren., Die Meteorologie hatte im Verlaufe des 19. Jahrhunderts den Charakter einer lediglich beobachtenden und beschreibenden Wissenschaft verloren. Auf der Grundlage der klassischen Physik, vor allem der Partikel- und Kontinuumsmechanik und der mechanischen Wärmetheorie, war sie dabei, sich zu einer messenden und rechnenden Naturwissenschaft zu entwickeln, zu einer Physik der Atmosphäre. Die Grundzüge der atmosphärischen Thermodynamik waren in den 1880er Jahren bereits ausgearbeitet, die Beschreibung der Dynamik erfolgte aber durch einfache Ansätze wie beispielsweise das Barische Windgesetz., Die wissenschaftliche Wettervorhersage steckte am Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts noch in den Kinderschuhen. Das lag einerseits an der unzureichenden Kenntnis der atmosphärischen Prozesse, andererseits an einem Mangel verlässlicher Beobachtungsdaten, die außerdem fast nur am Erdboden gewonnen wurden, während über den vertikalen Aufbau der Atmosphäre nur vage Vorstellungen bestanden., Frühere wissenschaftliche Ballonfahrten., Das Potential des Ballons zur Erforschung der freien Atmosphäre wurde schon früh erkannt. Bereits beim ersten Start eines Gasballons am 1. Dezember 1783 führte dessen Erfinder Jacques Charles ein Thermometer und ein Barometer mit. Schon im darauffolgenden Jahr stellte der Chemiker Antoine Laurent de Lavoisier im Auftrag der Académie française ein Programm für wissenschaftliche Luftfahrten auf, das allerdings nicht verwirklicht wurde. In Deutschland war es Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, der schon 1784 fünfundzwanzig Thesen über die Nutzung des Ballons aufstellte, deren erste die Erforschung der Atmosphäre thematisiert., Die erste Ballonfahrt mit dem Ziel, meteorologische Beobachtungen auszuführen, unternahm am 30. November 1784 der amerikanische Arzt John Jeffries gemeinsam mit dem Berufsballonfahrer Jean-Pierre Blanchard. Eine erste systematische Untersuchung der freien Atmosphäre führte zwischen 1862 und 1866 der englische Meteorologe und bedeutende Pionier der Aerologie James Glaisher durch. Auf 28 Ballonfahrten maß er die Temperatur, den Luftdruck, die Luftfeuchtigkeit und die Windgeschwindigkeit bis in eine Höhe von fast 9.000m. Da er seine Instrumente nicht ausreichend vor der Sonnenstrahlung schützte und er sie innerhalb des Ballonkorbs statt außerhalb anordnete, waren seine Temperaturmessungen besonders in größeren Höhen mit starken Fehlern behaftet. In den folgenden Jahren waren es vor allem französische Wissenschaftler wie Camille Flammarion, Gaston Tissandier und Wilfrid de Fonvielle, die wissenschaftliche Luftfahrten unternahmen. Jedoch blieben die Erforschungen der freien Atmosphäre bis in die 1890er Jahre isolierte Bemühungen vereinzelter Forscher., Entwicklungen in Berlin., 1885 wurde Wilhelm von Bezold zum Inhaber des neu geschaffenen Lehrstuhls für Meteorologie an der Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität und zum Direktor des Preußischen Meteorologischen Instituts in Berlin berufen. Er strukturierte das Institut tiefgreifend um und stellte zum 1. April 1886 drei wissenschaftliche Oberbeamte ein, darunter den Magdeburger Arzt und Meteorologen Richard Aßmann. Dieser arbeitete seit 1883 an einem Messgerät, das die Lufttemperatur auch unter dem störenden Einfluss der Sonnenstrahlung genau bestimmen konnte. Als Aßmann 1887 gemeinsam mit anderen führenden Berliner Meteorologen dem 1881 gegründeten Deutschen Verein zur Förderung der Luftschifffahrt beitrat, lernte er den Ingenieur Hans Bartsch von Sigsfeld kennen, der für die 1884 aufgestellte Luftschifferabteilung, die den Eisenbahntruppen des preußischen Heeres zugeordnet war, am selben Problem arbeitete. Gemeinsam entwickelten sie das Aßmannsche Aspirationspsychrometer, bei dem der Strahlungseinfluss durch Abschirmung und permanente Belüftung ausgeschaltet ist., Die von Glaisher aufgenommenen Temperaturprofile galten lange als gesichertes Wissen, waren aber vereinzelt auch angezweifelt worden, da sie theoretischen Erwägungen in wichtigen Punkten widersprachen. Aßmann und Sigsfeld sahen nun die Gelegenheit gekommen, Glaishers Resultate mit dem neuen Instrument kritisch zu überprüfen., Am 2. Juni 1888 hielt Wilhelm von Bezold vor dem Deutschen Verein zur Förderung der Luftschifffahrt auf dessen 100. Sitzung eine Festrede zum Thema \\"Die Bedeutung der Luftschiffahrt für die Meteorologie\\". Darin skizzierte er ein Programm zur Zusammenarbeit von Meteorologie und Luftschifffahrt bei der Erforschung der freien Atmosphäre, das von den Vereinsmitgliedern wohlwollend aufgenommen wurde. Seine Umsetzung dominierte die Vereinstätigkeit für mehr als ein Jahrzehnt. Bereits am 23. Juni 1888 fand die erste Fahrt mit Sigsfelds Ballon \\"Herder\\" statt., Finanzierung., Für die Durchführung des Unternehmens waren bedeutende Geldmittel erforderlich. Durch Spenden von Vereinsmitgliedern (Rudolph Hertzog, Werner von Siemens, Otto Lilienthal) konnte der Fesselballon \\"Meteor\\" angeschafft werden. Die Königlich-Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften gewährte einmalig einen Betrag von 2.000 Mark. Mehrmals stellten Privatpersonen (Hans Bartsch von Sigsfeld, Kurt Killisch-Horn (1856–1915), Patrick Young Alexander) ihre privaten Ballons zur Verfügung. Insgesamt war der Verein jedoch nicht in der Lage, die benötigten Mittel für den Bau und Betrieb eines geeigneten Ballons aufzubringen. Daraufhin verfasste Mitte 1892 ein „Ausschuss zur Veranstaltung wissenschaftlicher Luftfahrten“, bestehend aus Richard Aßmann, Wilhelm von Bezold, Hermann von Helmholtz, Werner von Siemens, Wilhelm Foerster, August Kundt und Paul Güßfeldt, eine Immediateingabe an Kaiser Wilhelm II., die von der Akademie der Wissenschaften unterstützt wurde. Der Kaiser gewährte die beantragten 50.000 Mark für den Bau und Betrieb des Ballons \\"Humboldt\\" aus seinem „Allerhöchsten Dispositionsfonds“ und nach dem Explosionsunglück des \\"Humboldt\\" weitere 32.000 Mark für den Bau des \\"Phönix\\". Zur Finanzierung ergänzender Fahrten und für die Publikation der wissenschaftlichen Ergebnisse erfolgte 1895 nach erneuter Immediateingabe die Zahlung weiterer 20.400 Mark. 1897 spendete der Verleger Georg Büxenstein für den Bau des Registrierballons \\"CirrusII\\" 1.000 Mark., Eine starke immaterielle Förderung erfuhr das Unternehmen auch durch das preußische Militär, das ein ausgeprägtes Interesse an einer militärischen Nutzung des Luftraums hatte. Offiziere der Luftschifferabteilung übernahmen in den meisten Fällen die Führung der Ballons. Mehrmals wurde den Meteorologen gestattet, an militärischen Ausbildungsfahrten teilzunehmen. Premierleutnant Groß wurde zeitweise von seinen Dienstverpflichtungen freigestellt und war für die Konstruktion der für die Hauptfahrten verwendeten Ballons verantwortlich., Teilnehmer., Organisator der Berliner wissenschaftlichen Luftfahrten war Richard Aßmann. Neben seiner Position am Meteorologischen Institut war er seit Anfang 1889 auch Vorsitzender des Vereins zur Förderung der Luftschifffahrt. Aßmann sorgte für eine exzellente instrumentelle Ausstattung. Er nahm als Leiter des Projekts nur an drei bemannten Luftfahrten persönlich teil., Sein engster Mitarbeiter am Meteorologischen Institut war seit 1889 Arthur Berson. Er nahm an 50 der 65 bemannten Luftfahrten teil. Er bestritt 31 Fahrten als verantwortlicher Observator und 9 als Ballonführer. Bei 10 Alleinfahrten war er beides in einer Person. Berson hatte auch großen Anteil an der wissenschaftlichen Bearbeitung der umfangreichen Messdaten., Der Premierleutnant der Berliner Luftschifferabteilung Hans Groß spielte als Konstrukteur der verwendeten Gasballons und in 32 Fällen als Ballonführer eine wichtige Rolle bei der Vorbereitung und Durchführung der Luftfahrten. Seine stetigen Verbesserungen der vorhandenen Ballontechnik, z.B. die Einführung einer Reißvorrichtung zum schnellen Ablassen des Füllgases, die auch heutige Gasballons in fast unveränderter Form besitzen, machte die oftmals gefährlichen Unternehmungen zunehmend sicherer., Neben Berson war auch Reinhard Süring, der spätere Direktor des Meteorologisch-Magnetischen Observatoriums Potsdam, als Observator (zehn Fahrten), Ballonführer (eine Fahrt) und dreimal als Alleinfahrer tätig. Als Observatoren beteiligten sich außerdem in fünf Fällen Otto Baschin, dreimal Richard Börnstein, je zweimal Victor Kremser, Hans Bartsch von Sigsfeld (davon einmal als Ballonführer) und Edmund Köbke sowie je einmal Hermann Stade (1867–1932), Börnsteins Assistent Becker, der Mediziner Braehmer und Abbott Lawrence Rotch, der Direktor des Blue-Hill-Observatoriums Boston., Beteiligt waren ferner die Berufsluftschiffer Richard Opitz (1855–1892) und Stanley Spencer, der britische Luftfahrtpionier Patrick Young Alexander sowie eine Reihe von Militärluftschiffern wie Major Stephan von Nieber (1855–1920), der Kommandeur der Luftschifferabteilung, und Richard von Kehler., Technische Ausstattung., Ballons., Bei den 65 bemannten Freiballonfahrten kamen sechzehn verschiedene Ballons zum Einsatz, vom nur 290m³ Gas fassenden Ballon \\"Falke\\", der als „Schlechtwetterballon“ diente, wenn starke Winde oder Niederschläge die Gasbefüllung oder den Start eines großen Ballons verhinderten, bis zum 3.000m³ großen \\"Majestic\\" des Briten Patrick Alexander. Etwa drei Viertel der Fahrten wurden mit den von Groß entworfenen Ballons \\"M.W.\\", \\"Humboldt\\", \\"Phönix\\", \\"Sportpark Friedenau I\\" und \\"Sportpark Friedenau II\\" durchgeführt. Als Traggas fand Wasserstoff oder das billigere Leuchtgas Verwendung, häufig auch ein Gemisch aus beiden., Eine herausragende Bedeutung kam dem Ballon \\"Phönix\\" zu, der von Groß speziell für wissenschaftliche Luftfahrten konstruiert worden war. Er hatte genug Tragkraft, um auch Hochfahrten zu ermöglichen. Seine Hülle bestand aus zwei Lagen gummierten und vulkanisierten Baumwollstoffs.

Mit einer Fläche von rund 75.000m² und einer über 100-jährigen Geschichte ist es eines der bekanntesten Handelsunternehmen und war nach alter Konzeption das größte Warenhaus Europas., Das Gebäude des GUM befindet sich im Herzen Moskaus am Roten Platz, gegenüber dem Lenin-Mausoleum und dem Kreml. Es wurde 1893 nach Entwürfen von Alexander Pomeranzew und Wladimir Schuchow als \\"Obere Handelsreihen\\" (Верхние торговые ряды, \\"Werchnije torgowyje rjady\\") errichtet und stellt heute ein wichtiges Denkmal der historistischen russischen Architektur des späten 19.Jahrhunderts dar. Zu Sowjetzeiten jahrzehntelang geschlossen und später als \\"Staatliches Warenhaus\\" (Государственный универсальный магазин, \\"Gossudarstwenny uniwersalny magasin\\") geführt, weist das GUM zudem eine recht wechselvolle Geschichte auf., Allgemeines., Das Warenhaus GUM befindet sich am westlichen Rand des alten Geschäftsviertels Kitai-Gorod im Zentralen Verwaltungsbezirk Moskaus, unmittelbar im historischen Kern der Stadt. Das Gebäude des Warenhauses nimmt ein annähernd rechteckiges Areal zwischen dem Roten Platz, der Nikolskaja-Straße, der Wetoschny-Gasse und der Iljinka-Straße ein und verfügt über zehn Eingänge an allen vier Seiten des Gebäudes. In unmittelbarer Nähe des GUM befinden sich unter anderem die Basilius-Kathedrale, die Metro-Station \\"Ploschtschad Rewoljuzii\\" sowie die Moskworezki-Brücke über die Moskwa., Der 250Meter lange und 88Meter breite Innenraum des Gebäudes beherbergt auf drei Etagen rund 200 separate, unterschiedlich große Ladenlokale entlang dreier glasbedachter Längspassagen (auch \\"Linien\\" genannt) und dreier Querpassagen sowie der über ihnen beidseitig gelegenen, durch Brücken miteinander verbundenen Galerien in den beiden Obergeschossen. Von der Funktionsweise her ist das GUM daher kein typisches Warenhaus mehr, sondern vielmehr ein Einkaufszentrum. Dennoch wird es auch heute noch üblicherweise Warenhaus genannt, da sich diese Bezeichnung seit den Sowjetzeiten, wo der Handel einheitlich in staatlicher Hand war, fest eingebürgert hat. Insgesamt beträgt die Verkaufsfläche des GUM etwa 35.000m² bei einer Gesamtfläche von 75.000m². Die durchschnittliche Besucherzahl beläuft sich gegenwärtig auf etwa 30.000 Kunden täglich., Das GUM-Gebäude befindet sich im Eigentum der Stadt Moskau und wird seit 1990 von der im selben Jahr gegründeten Aktiengesellschaft \\"Warenhaus GUM\\" betrieben, die Pachtrechte am Gebäude bis 2042 besitzt. 75Prozent der GUM-Aktien werden gegenwärtig von der russischen Modehaus-Kette \\"Bosco di Ciliegi\\" gehalten, der Rest befindet sich im Streubesitz. Bis 2005 betrieb die Gesellschaft neben dem GUM zusätzlich die Warenhauskette \\"Stilny Gorod\\" sowie einige ehemals staatliche Geschäfte in Moskau. Der Reingewinn der Betreibergesellschaft betrug im Jahre 2006 rund 27,7 Millionen US-Dollar bei einem Umsatz von 97,2 Millionen Dollar., Aufgrund der zentralen Lage des Hauses und der daraus resultierenden hohen Mieten für die Lokale richtet sich das Angebot der meisten Geschäfte heute vorwiegend an zahlungskräftige Kunden. Dies gilt insbesondere für die Läden in den Passagen des Erdgeschosses, bei denen es sich meist um vornehme Boutiquen und Fachgeschäfte für teure Markenkleidung und -schuhe sowie Juweliersalons handelt. Auch mehrere namhafte deutsche Hersteller sind mit ihren Firmengeschäften im GUM vertreten, darunter adidas, Hugo Boss, Puma und Salamander. Etwas preiswerter ist die dritte Etage des Hauses, die neben einigen Geschäften mittlerer Preisklasse auch mehrere Gastronomiebetriebe, darunter ein russisches Fastfood-Restaurant, beherbergt. Darüber hinaus finden sich im GUM heute unter anderem Parfümeriehandlungen, Souvenir-, Spielzeug- und Haushaltswarenläden sowie Computer- und Multimediahandlungen., Architektur., Das GUM-Gebäude wurde in den Jahren 1890 bis 1893 nach einem Entwurf des Architekten Alexander Pomeranzew (1849–1918) unter Mitwirkung des Ingenieurs Wladimir Schuchow (1853–1939) erbaut. Insgesamt wird das Gebäude dem sogenannten neo- oder pseudorussischen Stil zugeordnet, einer Stilrichtung des Historismus, für die eine Mischung aus russisch-traditionalistischer Baukunst des 15.und 16.Jahrhunderts mit neoklassizistischen, westeuropäischen Elementen typisch ist., Der altrussische Einfluss ist vor allem an den Fassaden des Gebäudes zu sehen, die Pomeranzew in Anknüpfung an die Architektur der umliegenden Viertel, darunter die des Kremls und des benachbarten Historischen Museums, entwarf. Hierfür typisch sind insbesondere die großen, stilistisch an russisch-orthodoxe Kirchengebäude angelehnten Bogenfenster, die beiden spitzen Türme im Mittelbereich des Gebäudes, die an einige der Kreml-Türme erinnern, sowie im Stile des Terem-Palastes und ähnlicher vornehmer Wohngebäude des 16.Jahrhunderts geformte Dachabschnitte. Allerdings lassen sich an den GUM-Fassaden zusätzlich einige Elemente der europäischen Renaissance erkennen, wie etwa die zahlreichen Ornamente im Bereich der Fenster sowie arkadenähnliche Portale an den Eingängen. Auch dies ist für Pomeranzews Schaffen charakteristisch, da er von 1879 bis 1887 im europäischen Ausland – darunter in Italien – lebte und praktizierte und sich dabei von der dortigen Architektur inspirieren ließ. Für das gesamte Gebäude wurden bei dessen Errichtung etwa 40 Millionen Backsteine verwendet. Die Außenwände erhielten eine Verkleidung aus Granit, Marmor und Kalkstein. Am aufwändigsten wurde die Fassade zum Roten Platz hin gestaltet, in deren Mitte sich der zentrale Warenhauseingang befindet: Die erste Etage ist hier mit Marmor aus Tarussa verkleidet, wodurch die Fassade in ihrem unteren Bereich heller erscheint als im mittleren und im oberen, und mit einem massiven Gesims von den beiden Obergeschossen abgegrenzt., Im Gegensatz zu den Fassaden, die vornehmlich an die Traditionen altrussischer Baukunst anknüpfen, wurde der Innenraum des GUM in einem für Ende des 19.Jahrhunderts sehr modernen, an die europäische Architektur angelehnten Stil geschaffen und mit zahlreichen Stahl- und Glaselementen versehen. Für die damalige Zeit einzigartig und auch heute noch markant sind die transparenten, konkav geformten Dachkonstruktionen über den drei Längspassagen mit jeweils 15m Spannweite und 250m Länge. Sie entstanden nach dem Entwurf Wladimir Schuchows, der hierfür rund 60.000 Glasscheiben verwendete, die von Metallelementen mit einem Gesamtgewicht von 833 Tonnen getragen werden. Eine ähnliche Konstruktion konzipierte Schuchow einige Jahre später auch für den Kiewer Bahnhof und eine Reihe anderer öffentlicher Gebäude in Moskau., Die Etagen des Gebäudes wurden durch seitlich angelegte Treppenhäuser verbunden, die erst Anfang der 2000er-Jahre im Zuge der Gebäudesanierungsarbeiten durch Fahrtreppen an den Querpassagen ergänzt wurden. Die Galerien an den beiden Obergeschossen sind durch Stahlbetonbrücken miteinander verbunden, die nach einem Entwurf des Ingenieurs Arthur Loleit (1868–1933) beim Bau des Warenhauses errichtet worden sind. Im Kellergeschoss des Gebäudes befinden sich unter anderem Lagerräume sowie Besuchertoiletten., Ein weiteres markantes Bauwerk im Inneren des GUM ist der Springbrunnen, der sich im Mittelpunkt des Gebäudes, am Kreuzungspunkt der beiden mittleren Längs- und Querpassagen befindet. Er wurde dort wenige Jahre nach der Eröffnung des Warenhauses aufgestellt und besaß ursprünglich ein kreisförmiges Becken, das jedoch im Zuge des Umbaus 1953 durch ein achteckiges Becken aus rotem Quarzit ersetzt wurde. Den Mittelpunkt des Brunnens bildet eine pilzförmige bronzene Konstruktion, deren Spitze bis auf das Höhenniveau des ersten Obergeschosses reicht. Gestützt wird der Springbrunnen durch spezielle Metallpfeiler, die sich genau unter ihm im Untergeschoss befinden. Genau über dem Gebäudemittelpunkt mit dem Springbrunnen nimmt die Glasdachkonstruktion eine Kuppelform an. Der Springbrunnen dient bis heute vielen Moskauern als Treffpunkt für Verabredungen., Geschichte., Die Oberen Handelsreihen bis zum 19. Jahrhundert., Wie aus diversen Urkunden der damaligen Zeit hervorgeht, waren die Viertel unmittelbar östlich des Roten Platzes bereits vor dem 17.Jahrhundert vom Handel geprägt. Auch auf dem Platz selbst, der schon damals den zentralen Platz der Stadt darstellte, waren vielfach Verkaufsstände aufgestellt. Stellenweise reichten sie bis an die Mauern des Kreml, welcher noch bis Anfang des 18.Jahrhunderts Zarenresidenz war. Mit der Bevölkerungszunahme Moskaus im späten 18.Jahrhundert dehnte sich auch der Straßenhandel im Herzen der Stadt immer weiter aus; in der zweiten Jahrhunderthälfte glich bereits das gesamte Gelände zwischen dem Roten Platz und den östlich hieran angrenzenden Straßen einem riesigen Marktplatz. Dabei hatte sich für das unmittelbar an den Roten Platz angrenzende, auf einer Anhöhe liegende Areal die Bezeichnung \\"Obere Handelsreihen\\" (russisch, \\"Werchnije torgowyje rjady\\") eingebürgert, während die Marktplätze der beiden am Hang zum Moskwa-Ufer hinunter gelegenen Viertel östlich der Basilius-Kathedrale dementsprechend \\"Mittlere\\" bzw. \\"Untere Handelsreihen\\" genannt wurden. Einige Straßennamen – so die \\"Fischgasse\\" (russ., \\"Rybnyi pereulok\\") oder die \\"Bleikristallgasse\\" (, \\"Chrustalnyi pereulok\\") – erinnern bis heute an die Zeit, als im Bereich des Roten Platzes ausschließlich Straßenhandel betrieben wurde und sich für bestimmte Waren – neben Fisch und Bleikristall beispielsweise Gemüse, Butter, Gold, Silber oder Seide – eigene Marktreihen bildeten., Erste Bestrebungen, die ungeordneten Handelsaktivitäten rund um den Roten Platz unter ein Dach zu bringen, gab es in der zweiten Hälfte des 18.Jahrhunderts.

Space-Shuttle-Mission sowie nach fast fünfjähriger Pause der erste Flug dieses Orbiters, bedingt durch das Unglück der Columbia im Februar 2003 (STS-107). Es war der letzte Flug eines Spacehab-Moduls. STS-118 wurde am 8. August 2007 gestartet., Missionsüberblick., Die Endeavour transportierte den S5-Träger zur Internationalen Raumstation (ISS). Diese Gitterstruktur wurde von den Astronauten bei einem Außenbordeinsatz montiert., Außerdem wurden mit dem Spacehab-Modul 2,2 Tonnen Ausrüstung angeliefert. Umgekehrt wurden 1,8 Tonnen nicht mehr benötigter Geräte und abgeschlossener Experimente zurück auf die Erde gebracht., Während vier Ausstiegen wurden Aufbau- und Wartungsarbeiten am Äußeren der ISS durchgeführt., Erstmals wurde von der Endeavour das neue Energieübertragungssystem eingesetzt. Durch das SSPTS erhält der Orbiter während der Kopplung Strom von der Raumstation und kann so seine Aufenthaltszeit verlängern., Diese Mission führte auch das sogenannte „Teacher in Space Project“ durch, welches schon für STS-51-L geplant war, aber durch den Verlust der Raumfähre Challenger in einem tragischen Unfall endete. Barbara Morgan gab als erste Lehrerin vom Weltraum aus Unterrichtsstunden., Vorbereitungen., Kurz nach dem Ende der letzten Mission der Endeavour (STS-113) wurde die Raumfähre am 7. Dezember 2002 in die Orbiter Processing Facility gefahren und mit der Nachuntersuchung begonnen. Der Hitzeschild wies 64 Einschläge auf, von denen 13 größer als zweieinhalb Zentimeter waren, was ein normaler Wert ist., Ursprünglich hätte die Endeavour im Mai 2003 zur STS-115-Mission starten sollen, aber nach dem Unglück der Columbia im Februar 2003 entschied die NASA, die Raumfähre zu modernisieren und zu überholen. Während dieser \\"Orbiter Major Modification\\" wurde die Endeavour ab Dezember 2003 als letzter Orbiter mit einem sogenannten Glascockpit ausgerüstet, das die drei alten einfarbigen Röhrenbildschirme durch neun grafikfähige Multifunktionsanzeigen ersetzt. Daneben wurden aber auch größere Arbeiten an allen Systemen des Shuttles durchgeführt. Zudem wurde das neue SSPTS-Energieübertragungssystem \\"(Station-to-Shuttle Power Transfer System)\\" installiert, das elektrische Energie von der Raumstation zur Endeavour überträgt. Damit wird die mögliche Kopplungsdauer um 20 Prozent verlängert. Außerdem wurde das Landesystem TACAN durch das GPS-System ersetzt. Dadurch kann die Fähre auf jeder geeigneten Piste landen, die 2,3 Kilometer lang und 40 Meter breit ist. Insgesamt wurden während der dreijährigen Umbauphase 194 Änderungen vorgenommen., Ende Januar 2007 wurden die drei Haupttriebwerke in die Endeavour eingebaut. Im Februar folgten die beiden OMS-Triebwerke (Orbital Maneuvering System). Am 6. April kam der Außentank für STS-118, der ET-117, in Florida an. Nachdem zunächst geplant war, damit den durch ein Unwetter beschädigten Tank der Vorgängermission, STS-117, zu ersetzen, wurde dieser schließlich doch repariert, und STS-118 erhielt den Tank., Um den 10. April 2007 wurden – wie auch bei der Atlantis – alle drei Haupttriebwerke zur Untersuchung auf Verunreinigungen ausgebaut. Derartige Verunreinigungen wurden aber nicht gefunden; nachdem noch eine Pumpe gewechselt worden war, waren am 27. April alle drei Triebwerke wieder eingebaut. Vom 24. April bis 12. Juni wurden die zwei Feststoffraketen \\"(Booster)\\" aufgebaut; am 17. Juni wurde der Außentank zwischen die beiden Booster montiert., Nach dem Abschluss der Vorbereitungen und dem Auswechseln einer Wärmeisoliermatte am Heck des Orbiters wurde die Endeavour am 2. Juli von der Orbiter Processing Facility in die Montagehalle (Vehicle Assembly Building) gerollt. Am Tag darauf wurde die Endeavour mit den Boostern und dem Außentank verbunden. Vom 9. bis 11. Juli wurde der Nutzlastkanister mit dem Spacehab, S5 und ESP-3 in die Ladebucht eingesetzt., In Vorbereitung auf den am nächsten Tag beginnenden Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test, kurz TCDT, traf die Mannschaft am 16. Juli am Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ein. Während dieser zweitägigen Übung simulierte die Besatzung die letzten Stunden des Countdown. Außerdem wurde die Flucht von der Startrampe in einer Gefahrensituation geprobt. Der TCDT endete mit einem simulierten Startabbruch für die Besatzung und das Kontrollteam. Anschließend flog die Crew zurück nach Houston., Am 25. und 26. Juli fand das \\"Flight Readiness Review\\" statt, die Flugbereitschaftsabnahme, bei der entschieden wurde, dass alle Systeme startbereit sind. Außerdem wurde das vorläufige Startdatum, der 7. August, als erste Startmöglichkeit bestätigt. Auf der anschließenden Pressekonferenz erklärte William Gerstenmaier, der NASA-Direktor für den Raumflugbetrieb, dass es an einem Computer, der mit der Endeavour zur Raumstation geflogen werden soll, beim Hersteller des Gerätes einen Sabotageakt gegeben habe. Der Fall werde untersucht und das Gerät bis zum Start repariert., Anlässlich einer regulären Dichteprüfung stellten Techniker am 29. Juli fest, dass entweder das Spacehab oder die Mannschaftskabine Druck verlor. In weiteren Tests erwies sich der Druckverlust als bis zu zehnmal höher als erlaubt. Nach zwei Tagen wurde ein falsch befestigter Zuleitungsschlauch als Ursache ausgemacht. Am 31. Juli zeigte sich, dass noch immer Luft entwich. Eins der zwei Überdruckventilen in der Mannschaftskabine arbeitete nicht korrekt – es wurde am 2. August durch ein Bauteil aus der Atlantis ausgetauscht. Die anschließenden Drucktests verliefen sämtlich erfolgreich., Im Anschluss an eine am KSC abgehaltene Konferenz erklärten die NASA-Verantwortlichen am 3. August, dass wegen der unvorhergesehenen Reparaturarbeiten alle Reservezeit aufgebraucht sei. Deshalb habe man sich zu einer 24-stündigen Startverschiebung auf den 8. August entschieden. Dies würde den Technikern ausreichend Zeit für die Vorbereitungen verschaffen. Wenige Stunden später traf die siebenköpfige Besatzung am Raumfahrtzentrum ein. Am 5. August bestanden alle entsprechenden Sektionen (Mannschaftskabine, Verbindungstunnel, Spacehab) einen vierstündigen Drucktest., Missionsverlauf., Start., Der Countdown für die Mission begann am 6. August um 0:00 UTC bei der T-43-Stunden-Marke. Kathy Winters, seit fünf Jahren hauptverantwortliche USAF-Meteorologin für die Shuttle-Starts, erklärte, dass für den Starttag die Wahrscheinlichkeit für gutes Wetter bei 70 Prozent liege. Nur vereinzelt seien Schauer zu erwarten. Am Tag darauf teilte die NASA mit, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit für einen Shuttle-Start auf 80 Prozent gestiegen sei. Außerdem telefonierte Laura Bush, die Frau des US-Präsidenten, mit Barbara Morgan und wünschte ihr eine gute Mission., Das erste sichtbare Zeichen, dass der Start in wenigen Stunden erfolgen würde, war das Zurückschwenken der RSS-Wartungsbühne (Rotating Service Structure) in ihre Parkposition. Diese 120°-Drehung begann wie geplant am 8. August um 1:00 UTC und dauerte 45 Minuten. Um 12:11 UTC begann das dreistündige Befüllen des großen Außentanks: zunächst mit flüssigem Wasserstoff in den unteren Bereich und 40 Minuten später mit flüssigem Sauerstoff in die obere Sektion des Tanks., Um 18:47 UTC wurde die Mannschaft von den Mannschaftsquartieren zur Startrampe gefahren, wo sie eine Viertelstunde später eintraf. Nachdem sie mit dem Aufzug auf die 59-Meter-Ebene gefahren waren, wurden die Astronauten für den Einstieg vorbereitet. Um 21:07 UTC wurde durch das Ice Team ein Riss am Isolierschaum am Außentank festgestellt, es wurde jedoch gemeldet, dass dieser Riss keine Gefahr darstellte. Später, um 20:52 UTC, wurde beim Schließen der Luke ein Problem mit den Sensoren der Luke festgestellt. Die Sensoren sollen anzeigen, ob die Luke geschlossen sei. Um 21:20 UTC meldete die Weißraummannschaft, dass das Problem mit den Sensoren der Luke gelöst sei und verließ danach die Startrampe. Außerdem meldeten alle Notlandeplätze gutes Wetter., Die Endeavour startete wie geplant um 22:36 UTC unter ausgezeichneten Wetterbedingungen. Nach dem Ausbrennen der drei Haupttriebwerke wurde der Außentank abgeworfen und von den Astronauten fotografiert, um Schäden entdecken zu können. Später wurden die Ladebuchttore geöffnet., Auf einer anschließenden Pressekonferenz teilte der NASA-Leiter für den Raumflugbetrieb, Bill Gerstenmaier, mit, dass die Videoaufnahmen der Tankkamera gezeigt hätten, dass vier kleine Stücke Isolierschaum abgeplatzt waren. Dies sei aber zu einem unkritischen Zeitpunkt geschehen., Inspektion und Kopplung., Am zweiten Flugtag (9. August) wurde, wie seit STS-114 üblich, der Hitzeschild überprüft. Dazu wurde an den Roboterarm des Orbiters der OBSS-Inspektionsarm befestigt und anschließend die besonders gefährdeten Bereiche untersucht. Nacheinander wurden die rechte Tragfläche, die Nase und der linke Flügel abgetastet., Im Laufe des Tages teilte die NASA mit, dass sich beim Start der Endeavour insgesamt neun Schaumstoffstücke vom Außentank lösten. Eine erste Film- und Fotoanalyse habe gezeigt, dass nur drei Teile die Fähre getroffen hätten. Es gäbe jedoch keinerlei Anzeichen für eine Beschädigung. Die drei Bruchstücke trafen den Orbiter 24, 58 und 173 Sekunden nach dem Start. Alle Teile seien aber so klein gewesen, dass sie keinen ernsthaften Schaden anrichten könnten., Nach einer zweitägigen Verfolgung hatte die Endeavour die ISS am 10. August (3. Flugtag) eingeholt und koppelte um 18:02 UTC an. Zuvor hatte der 43-jährige Shuttle-Kommandant Scott Kelly die US-Raumfähre in 180 Meter Entfernung zur Raumstation positioniert. Während beide Raumschiffe über dem Atlantik flogen, führte die Endeavour das obligatorische „Purzelbaum-Rückwärts-Manöver“ durch. Diese zehn Minuten nutzte die ISS-Besatzung, um die gesamte Unterseite des Orbiters mit hochauflösenden Kameras zu fotografieren und so mögliche Kleinstschäden am Hitzeschutzschild aufzudecken., Während die Dichtigkeitstests durchgeführt wurden, aktivierte Missionsspezialistin Tracy Caldwell den Roboterarm des Orbiters und hob das S5-Element aus der Ladebucht. Nachdem zwei Stunden nach der Ankunft die Luken geöffnet wurden und sich die zwei Mannschaften begrüßt hatten, wurde S5 an den ISS-Roboterarm übergeben, der es bis zur Montage am nächsten Tag verwahrte., Um 21:17 UTC wurde erstmals das neue SSPTS-Energieübertragungssystem (Station-to-Shuttle Power Transfer System) er: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Endeavour Raumfähre, Kanadische Raumfahrt, NASA, Raumfahrtmission, STS-118, Space Transportation System, Columbia Unglück, Spacehab-Modul, S5-Träger, Außenbordeinsatz"},{"prompt":"What is a more high value way to these these \\"The Video Version The Audio Version The Text Version \\" Make the wording very simple and simple words","completion":"- The video edition - The audio edition - The textual edition"},{"prompt":"Give another but make it sound more luxurious","completion":"- The exquisite visual rendition - The opulent auditory rendition - The refined textual rendition"},{"prompt":"Make it sound luxurious but make the wording simple","completion":"- The fancy video format - The posh audio format - The elegant text format"},{"prompt":"More concise but still luxurious","completion":"- The lavish video version - The deluxe audio version - The upscale text version"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Bahnstrecke in Berlin, Bahnstrecke in Brandenburg, S-Bahn Berlin, Spurweite 1435 mm, Verkehr (Landkreis Barnim), Verkehr (Landkreis Märkisch-Oderland)], Die Bahnstrecke Berlin–Wriezen, auch Wriezener Bahn genannt, ist eine 1898 eröffnete Nebenbahn in Berlin und Brandenburg. Sie führt vom Bahnhof Berlin-Lichtenberg (bis 1938: Lichtenberg-Friedrichsfelde) über Ahrensfelde, Werneuchen und Tiefensee nordostwärts nach Wriezen im Oderbruch. Zusammen mit der in Wriezen anschließenden sechs Jahre älteren Bahnstrecke Wriezen– Jädickendorf bestand bis 1945 ein direkter Schienenweg von Berlin über Königsberg (Neumark) nach Stargard im heutigen Polen., Ausgangspunkt der Strecke ist der Bahnhof Berlin-Lichtenberg. Von Beginn an fuhren einzelne Reisezüge auch in Verlängerung über die Ostbahn ab dem zentraler gelegenen Schlesischen Bahnhof (heute: Ostbahnhof). Im Jahr 1903 ging nordöstlich des Schlesischen Bahnhofs der \\"Wriezener Bahnsteig\\" in Betrieb. Der ab 1924 als \\"Wriezener Bahnhof\\" bezeichnete Flügelbahnhof war bis 1949 Ausgangspunkt der Reisezüge in Richtung Wriezen. Anfang der 1970er Jahre wurde der Streckenteil zwischen Berlin-Lichtenberg und Berlin-Marzahn aufgegeben. Die Züge fuhren seitdem über das einen Kilometer östlich gelegene Biesdorfer Kreuz auf einer parallel zur Ostbahn ostwärts und dem Berliner Außenring nordwärts errichteten Neubaustrecke. Im Jahr 1998 wurde der Verkehr zwischen Tiefensee und Wriezen und 2006 ab Werneuchen eingestellt. Seit 2004 findet von Tiefensee bis zum Prötzeler Ortsteil Sternebeck ein touristischer Draisinenbetrieb statt., Zwischen Sternebeck und Wriezen ist seit 1997 der Verein MEV Museumseisenbahn Sternebeck aktiv für die Freihaltung der Bahnanlagen tätig., Geschichte., Vorgeschichte., Pläne für eine Eisenbahnverbindung von Berlin in die Neumark datierten aus dem Jahr 1863. Ein Komitee unter Vorsitz des Königsberger Bürgermeisters bat beim preußischen Handelsministerium um die Erlaubnis für Vorarbeiten einer Bahnstrecke Stargard– Pyritz– Zehden– Freienwalde– Berlin. Der zuständige Minister lehnte das Vorhaben mit Verweis auf die nicht näher ausgeführte Beschaffung von Geldmitteln ab. Nach erneuter Vorstellung gestattete der Minister am 11.August 1864 die Vorarbeiten für die Strecke Stargard– Königsberg– Freienwalde unter dem Vorbehalt, dass daraus kein Anspruch auf eine Konzession entstünde. Selbige wurde nach Abschluss der Arbeiten mehrmals verweigert, da das Ministerium die Wirtschaftlichkeit nicht gegeben sah. So fiel die Distanz zwischen Berlin und Stargard nur um 0,8Meilen (≈6,0Kilometer) kürzer aus als über die seit 1846 bestehende Verbindung. Demgegenüber stand aber die deutlich ungünstigere Trassierung über den Barnim mit stärkeren Steigungen. Ein Verbesserungsvorschlag zielte darauf ab, die Strecke über Wriezen statt über Freienwalde zu führen, da dieser Verlauf eine günstigere Trassierung aufwies., Neben dem Vorschlag des Königsberger Komitees, dem auch der Oberbarnimer Landrat Alexis von Haeseler angehörte, gab es in der Gründerzeit weitere Projekte ähnlicher Natur. Unter anderem beabsichtigten sowohl die Berlin-Stettiner als auch die Breslau-Schweidnitz-Freiburger Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft den Bau einer Bahnstrecke quer durch das Oderbruch. Die Berlin-Stettiner-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft schloss Wriezen 1866 über eine Zweigbahn aus Eberswalde an das Eisenbahnnetz an. 1873 erhielt die Direktion der Königlichen Ostbahn den Auftrag, allgemeine Vorarbeiten für den Bau einer Strecke von Berlin über Wriezen und Pyritz nach Stargard vorzunehmen. Erwähnt sei auch der Vorschlag des Wriezener Bürgermeisters Mahler einer Bahnstrecke von Berlin über Wriezen nach Konitz, den dieser dem Staatsministerium 1874 vorlegte. Die Vorhaben zerschlugen sich infolge der Gründerkrise in den späten 1870er Jahren., Bau und Inbetriebnahme., Ausgehend von der Initiative des Königsberger Landrats Bernd von Gerlach verabschiedete der Preußische Landtag am 19.April 1886 ein Eisenbahn-Anleihegesetz zur Finanzierung der Strecke Wriezen– Jädickendorf inklusive der Herstellung einer Oderbrücke für den Eisenbahn- und Fuhrwerksverkehr. Im Jahr darauf begann die Königliche Eisenbahndirektion Berlin (KED Berlin) mit den Vorarbeiten zur Herstellung einer Nebenbahn von Lichtenberg-Friedrichsfelde nach Wriezen. Das Vorhaben wurde am 8.April 1889 per Gesetz bewilligt. Das Eisenbahn-Anleihegesetz sah eine Investitionssumme von vier Millionen Mark vor, davon waren rund 433.000Mark für den Grunderwerb, 313.000Mark für die Beschaffung von Dampflokomotiven und 106.000 für den Ankauf von acht Personen- und zwei Gepäckwagen vorgesehen. Die gewählte Linienführung wich im Westabschnitt stark von der 1874 vorgeschlagenen Linie ab. Der Vorschlag sah als Ausgangspunkt einen eigenen Berliner Endbahnhof nördlich des Friedrichshains und eine Streckenführung über Hohenschönhausen, Altlandsberg, Strausberg, Prötzel, Möglin und Bliesdorf nach Wriezen vor. Da diese zu nah an der Ostbahn verlaufen wäre, wurde stattdessen eine Streckenführung über Werneuchen gewählt. Ausgangspunkt war der Bahnhof Lichtenberg-Friedrichsfelde an der Ostbahn, als Zwischenhalte waren der Haltepunkt Marzahn, die Haltestellen Ahrensfelde, Blumberg und Seefeld, der Bahnhof Werneuchen sowie die Haltestellen Tiefensee, Sternebeck und Schulzendorf vorgesehen. Auf Antrag des Gutsbesitzers Ernst von Eckardstein-Prötzel, der für den Bahnbau Grund und Boden auf neun Kilometern Streckenlänge unentgeltlich abtrat und das Vorhaben mit 5500Mark unterstützte, wurde eine weitere Haltestelle bei Leuenberg zwischen Tiefensee und Sternebeck in das Projekt aufgenommen., Zunächst verzögerten Probleme beim Grunderwerb den Bahnbau. So widerrief der Gutsherr von Harnekop, General Gottlieb von Haeseler die von seinem Vater 1874 geäußerte Zusage zur Abtretung von Grund und Boden für den Bahnbau. Er wünschte stattdessen, dass die Strecke zwischen Schulzendorf und Sternebeck soweit nach Süden verlegt wird, dass sein Besitz nicht davon berührt würde. Der Minister der öffentlichen Arbeiten Karl von Thielen entsprach dem Wunsch des Grafen Haeseler, wodurch der Schulzendorfer Bahnhof weit außerhalb der Gemeinde entstand. Der Kreis Niederbarnim war nicht bereit, die Kosten für den Grunderwerb im Kreisgebiet zu übernehmen, da sich die Kreisverwaltung einen erheblich geringeren Nutzen von der Bahn versprach als die weiter entfernt liegenden Kreise Oberbarnim und Königsberg/Nm. Interessenten aus dem Oberbarnim boten dem Kreis daraufhin Subventionen in Höhe von 25.000Mark an. Die Stadt Berlin war nicht bereit, das von der Bahntrasse durchschnittene Gelände durch die Irrenanstalt Herzberge und die städtischen Rieselfelder bei Bürknersfelde, Falkenberg und Ahrensfelde entschädigungslos und lastenfrei abzutreten. Die seit 1895 für den Bahnbau zuständige Königliche Eisenbahndirektion Stettin (KED Stettin) musste sich bereit erklären, die Kosten für den Eingriff in die Rieselfelder zu übernehmen. Außerdem erwirkte die Berliner Stadtverordnetenversammlung den Bau eines Haltepunkts beim Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde. Die Verhandlungen mit beiden Verwaltungen zogen sich bis ins Jahr 1896 hin. Im Frühjahr 1897 begann dann der Streckenbau, der bis September 1898 abgeschlossen werden konnte., Die Strecke wurde in zwei Teilen eröffnet. Am 1.Mai 1898 ging der 23,57Kilometer lange westliche Abschnitt von Lichtenberg-Friedrichsfelde nach Werneuchen in Betrieb, gleichzeitig übernahm die KED Berlin die Strecke von der KED Stettin. Der Weiterbau verzögerte sich, da insbesondere im Bereich des Gamengrundes bei Tiefensee umfangreiche Erdarbeiten nötig waren, um den 50Meter hohen Damm aufzuschütten. Der große Höhenunterschied zwischen Schulzendorf () und Wriezen () erforderte bei dem maximalen Gefälle von 10Promille eine Streckenverlängerung um 900Meter. Im letzten Baulos bereiteten vor allem Geschiebe den Bauarbeitern große Mühe. Auf Betreiben des Oberbarnimer Landrates Heinrich von Oppen entstand bei Vevais eine Überführung, da ein Bahnübergang an gleicher Stelle schwer einzusehen gewesen wäre. Arbeitermangel verzögerten die Fertigstellung der Strecke schließlich um weitere zwei Wochen, sodass anstelle des anvisierten Termins am 1.Oktober die Strecke am 15.Oktober freigegeben wurde. Der 33,18Kilometer lange Ostabschnitt von Werneuchen nach Wriezen verblieb nach der Inbetriebnahme bei der KED Stettin. In Wriezen ging das Streckengleis nach Kreuzung mit der Strecke Eberswalde– Frankfurt (Oder) direkt in das Streckengleis nach Jädickendorf über., Die Unterwegsstationen erhielten neben dem Hauptgleis in der Regel ein Kreuzungsgleis, ein Ladegleis sowie ein kleines Empfangsgebäude aus rotem oder gelbem Ziegelmauerwerk. Die Empfangsgebäude umfassten jeweils einen Dienstraum, zwei Wartesäle, Aborte und Geräteschuppen. Für den Sommerverkehr wurden einige Gebäude mit offenen Hallen ergänzt. Werneuchen als betrieblicher Mittelpunkt der Strecke und Endpunkt der Verstärkerzüge aus Berlin erhielt einen zweiten Dienstraum und eine Bahnhofsgaststätte. Für den Güterverkehr standen Kopf- und Seitenrampen sowie in Tiefensee, Sternebeck und Leuenberg Holzumschlagplätze zur Verfügung. Für die Beamten entstanden auf dem Bahnhofsgelände Dienstwohnungen. Den Forderungen des Kriegsministeriums entsprechend, waren Werneuchen und Schulzendorf mit 500Meter langen Kreuzungsgleisen für die Begegnung von Militärzügen ausgestattet, die übrigen Stationen erhielten anfangs 270Meter lange Gleise., 1900 bis 1920., In den ersten Jahren nach Eröffnung der Wriezener Bahn gab es auf der Ostbahn, in die die Wriezener Bahn in Lichtenberg-Friedrichsfelde mündete, merkliche Kapazitätsengpässe in Richtung Berlin. Nur ein einziges tägliches Reisezugpaar der Wriezener Bahn konnte ab Lichtenberg-Friedrichsfelde weiter in Richtung Schlesischer Bahnhof geführt wurde., Zur Jahrhundertwende wurden die Anlagen von Ostbahn und Schlesischen Bahn umfassend umgebaut. An beiden Strecken entstanden separate Gleispaare für die Stadt- und Vorortzüge getrennt von den Fern- und Gütergleisen. Die Fernzüge der Ostbahn und die Züge aus Richtung Strausberg fuhren ab 1901 über die weiter östlich verlaufende VnK-Strecke und die Ferngleise der Schlesischen Bahn zur Stadtbahn. Die Vorortzüge zur Stadtbahn nutzten von Lichtenberg-Friedrichsfelde die Vorortgleise der Ostbahn. Parallel dazu verkehrten die Güterzüge auf separaten Gleisen zum nördlich an die Anlagen des Schlesischen Bahnhofs und ö: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Bahnstrecke Berlin, Bahnstrecke Brandenburg, S-Bahn Berlin, Spurweite 1435 mm, Verkehr Landkreis Barnim, Verkehr Landkreis Märkisch-Oderland, Wriezener Bahn, Oderbruch, Berlin-Lichtenberg, Werneuchen"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Gürteltiere], Die Gürteltiere (Dasypoda) bilden die einzige überlebende Säugetiergruppe der Gepanzerten Nebengelenktiere (Cingulata). Sie werden heute in zwei Familien mit insgesamt rund 20 gegenwärtig vorkommenden Arten unterschieden, darüber hinaus sind zahlreiche weitere, ausgestorbene Vertreter bekannt. Die Gruppe ist über den südamerikanischen Kontinent und die südöstlichen Teile Nordamerikas verbreitet; ein Großteil der heutigen Arten konzentriert sich im zentralen und nördlichen Südamerika., Als einzige bekannte Säugetiergruppe der heutigen Zeit verfügen die Gürteltiere über eine knöcherne äußere Panzerbildung. Die mit Hornschuppen gepanzerten Schuppentiere galten früher irrtümlich als mit ihnen nahe verwandt. Gürteltiere treten weitgehend einzelgängerisch auf und leben in unterschiedlichem Maße unterirdisch in Erdbauen, wobei sie an diese grabende Lebensweise durch mehrere Skelettmodifikationen angepasst sind. Als Hauptnahrung werden verschiedenste Insekten konsumiert, einige Arten verzehren aber auch pflanzliche Nahrung oder vertilgen kleinere Wirbeltiere. Die Lebensgewohnheiten der Gürteltiere sind nicht in allen Fällen gut untersucht, vor allem was die Fortpflanzung betrifft., Das Fleisch wird von Menschen teilweise als Nahrungsressource genutzt, manche Skelettteile werden lokal auch als handwerkliche Rohstoffe verwendet. Einige Arten gelten aufgrund ihrer bodenwühlenden Aktivitäten als Landplage. In Europa bekannt wurden die Gürteltiere erstmals am Anfang des 16. Jahrhunderts, die heute anerkannte Erstbeschreibung der Gruppe der Dasypoda stammt aus dem Jahr 1885/1886., Die über Fossilfunde belegte stammesgeschichtliche Entwicklung kann bis in das Paläozän vor mehr als 56 Millionen Jahren zurückverfolgt werden. Die gegenwärtig bestehenden Arten traten jedoch erst relativ spät in Erscheinung. Die nächsten Verwandten der Gürteltiere sind die Ameisenbären und Faultiere. Alle drei Gruppen weisen besondere Skelettbildungen an der Wirbelsäule auf, die sie gemeinsam die Überordnung der Nebengelenktiere (Xenarthra) formen lassen, einer der vier großen Hauptlinien der Höheren Säugetiere., Körperbau., Habitus., Gürteltiere sind überwiegend kleine bis selten mittelgroße Säugetiere mit einer Kopf-Rumpf-Länge von 11 bis 100cm. Hinzu kommt ein Schwanz, der mit Ausnahme der Kugelgürteltiere (\\"Tolypeutes\\") und der Gürtelmulle häufig etwa die Hälfte der Körperlänge ausmacht, manchmal jedoch deutlich länger ist. Das Gewicht variiert ähnlich der Körpergröße sehr stark und reicht von 100g beim Gürtelmull (\\"Chlamyphorus truncatus\\") bis zu 45kg beim Riesengürteltier (\\"Priodontes giganteus\\"). Ausgestorbene Gürteltiere konnten allerdings auch erheblich größer werden und erreichten mit \\"Macroeuphractus\\", das schätzungsweise zwischen 90 und 120kg wog, das Gewicht heutiger kleinerer Hausschweine. Ein Großteil der bekannten Arten verblieb aber in der Größenvariabilität der rezenten Vertreter., Der Kopf hat eine schmale, spitz zulaufende Form, die Ohren stehen mausartig nach oben ab, die Augen sind sehr klein. Bei einigen Arten ist die Schnauze röhrenartig verlängert. Auf der Oberseite ist der Kopf mit Knochenplättchen besetzt, die einen Kopfpanzer formen. Charakteristisch ist der meist kräftig gewölbte Rückenpanzer, der fast die gesamte Körperoberfläche der Tiere bedeckt. An Vorder- und Hinterleib ist er häufig zu starren Rückenschilden verwachsen (Schulter- und Beckenschild, auch Buckler genannt), dazwischen befindet sich eine variierende Anzahl an zur Bauchseite offenen, querverlaufenden Ringen, die Gürtel oder Bänder, nach denen die Gruppe ihren deutschen Trivialnamen erhielt. Verbindungen mit überlappenden Hautfalten gewährleisten eine hohe Flexibilität des Panzers im Bereich der Bänder. Der spitz endende Schwanz ist bei den meisten Arten ebenfalls von Knochenringen umgeben. Auf dem Bauch dagegen findet sich keine Panzerung, manchmal aber einzelne Knochenplättchen. Eine Körperbehaarung ist nicht bei allen Arten ausgebildet, sofern sie vorhanden ist, sprießt sie in borstigen Haaren aus den Rückenschildchen oder an den Körperseiten und ist wollig dicht am Bauch., Die kurzen Beine haben hinten immer fünf, vorne jedoch vier bis fünf, selten auch drei Zehen, die stark gebogene Krallen tragen, wobei jene der Hinterfüße bei allen Arten deutlich kleiner als jene der vorderen sind. Dabei halten die Krallen an den mittleren Zehen der Vorderfüße des Riesengürteltiers mit bis zu 20cm Länge den Rekord der größten Krallen im gesamten heutigen Tierreich., Schädel- und Gebissmerkmale., Die verschiedenen Gürteltierarten besitzen variierende Schädelformen, die zumeist die Ernährungsweise widerspiegeln. Arten, die sich überwiegend von Insekten ernähren, besitzen meist einen leichter gebauten Schädel und Unterkiefer mit geringer entwickelten Muskelansatzstellen. Jene aber, die weitgehend als Allesfresser leben und zum Teil auch Pflanzen verzehren, sind durch massivere Schädel mit deutlich entwickelter Kaumuskulatur charakterisiert. Neben dem generellen Aufbau des Schädels der Säugetiere weisen die Gürteltiere zwei anatomische Besonderheiten auf. Im vorderen Bereich der Nasenhöhle tritt eine als Septomaxilla (Os nariale) bezeichnete Knochenbildung auf, die sonst nur bei stammesgeschichtlich älteren Säugetieren und Reptilien ausgebildet ist. Die Funktion dieses Knochens bei den Gürteltieren ist weitgehend unbekannt, wahrscheinlich dient er zum Verschließen der Nasenlöcher während des Grabens, damit kein Staub eingeatmet wird. Bei zahlreichen, aber nicht allen Gürteltierarten ist am Gehörgang anstatt einer Paukenblase ein tympanischer Ring ausgebildet., Der Unterkiefer ist bei vielen Arten zumeist lang, schmal und am Knochenkörper niedrig gebaut. Auffallend ist die nicht fest verknöcherte Symphyse, die die beiden Unterkieferhälften im vorderen Bereich verbindet. Im Zahnbau zeichnen sich ebenfalls die Unterschiede in der Ernährungsweise ab mit kleinen Zähnen bei den Insektenfressern und großen bei den Allesfressern. Zudem weichen die Zähne von denen der anderen Säugetiere ab: Sie sind homodont gestaltet, Schneide- oder Eckzähne beziehungsweise Prämolaren werden nicht ausgebildet. Das gesamte Gebiss besteht aus stiftartig einfachen, an Molaren erinnernde Zahnbildungen. Diese weisen dabei keinerlei Zahnschmelz auf – nur die Langnasengürteltiere (\\"Dasypus\\") und einige ausgestorbene Gattungen besitzen eine sehr dünne Zahnschmelzschicht, die sehr schnell abgekaut wird – und bestehen fast nur aus Zahnbein, hauptsächlich Orthodentin, dem härtesten Bestandteil des Zahnbeins. Einige Arten besitzen anstelle des Zahnschmelzes eine sehr dünne äußere Schicht an Zahnzement, was etwa beim Riesengürteltier oder beim Zwerggürteltier (\\"Zaedyus pichiy\\") der Fall ist. Die Anzahl der Zähne variiert von Art zu Art und häufig auch innerhalb der Arten und reicht insgesamt von 7 bis 25 je Kieferbogen. Die Zähne wachsen in der Regel ein Leben lang, lediglich bei den Langnasengürteltieren ist ein Zahnwechsel vom Milch- zum Dauergebiss nachgewiesen. Dieser kann mitunter sehr spät erfolgen, teilweise erst im ausgewachsenen Alter und variiert offensichtlich individuell., Panzerung., Die Ausbildung eines äußeren, knöchernen Körperpanzers, der den Kopf (Kopfschild) sowie den Rücken (Carapax) und mit Ausnahme der Nacktschwanzgürteltiere (\\"Cabassous\\") auch den Schwanz (Schwanzpanzer) sowie Teile der Beine bedeckt, ist einzigartig unter den Säugetieren und gibt den Gürteltieren und ihren ausgestorbenen Verwandten dadurch eine besondere Stellung innerhalb dieser Tierklasse. Er besteht aus Knochenplättchen, sogenannte Osteoderme, die in der Haut gebildet werden. Sie sind sowohl am Rückenpanzer als auch am Schwanz in Reihen angeordnet. Je nach Art variiert die Anzahl der panzerbildenden Osteoderme. Bei den Kugelgürteltieren liegt sie bei über 660, beim Zwerggürteltier bei rund 950 und bei den Borstengürteltieren (\\"Chaetophractus\\") bei über 1040. Die Osteoderme werden von Hornschildchen überzogen, die in zwei unterschiedlichen Weisen angeordnet sind: Einerseits bedeckt ein Hornschildchen mehrere, teilweise bis zu vier benachbarte Osteoderme gleichzeitig, andererseits nur ein oder maximal zwei. Erstere Variante wird als eher urtümlich für die Gürteltiere angesehen und ist fast ausschließlich nur bei den Langnasengürteltieren ausgebildet, letztere trifft auf die meisten anderen Arten zu., Die Osteoderme der starren Teile des Rückenpanzers besitzen häufig eine quadratische, vier- bis vieleckige Form. An den beweglichen Bändern sind sie dagegen zumeist länglich-rechteckig gestaltet und verfügen am vorderen Ende über eine Gelenkfläche, die sie mit dem entsprechenden Element der benachbarten Reihe verbindet. Ein einzelnes Osteoderm eines beweglichen Bandes unterlagert dadurch mit der Gelenkfläche sein Gegenstück der vorhergehenden Reihe und überdeckt im hinteren Abschnitt die jeweilige Gelenkfläche des nachfolgenden Knochenplättchens. Die Oberfläche der Osteoderme ist in der Regel ornamentiert. Dabei umfasst diese Oberflächenzeichnung in der Regel eine größere, zentrale Musterung, um die herum kleinere Muster konzentrisch oder seitlich angeordnet sind. Form und Oberflächengestaltung der Knochenplättchen variieren zwischen den Arten, beide Merkmale haben somit taxonomischen Wert. Die Hornschildchen sind zumeist rundlich in ihrer Gestalt und überlagern die Knochenplättchen. Bei den Langnasengürteltieren, deren Hornschildchen mehrere Osteoderme bedecken, entsteht so am Schulter- und Beckenschild mitunter ein irreguläres Muster, bei den anderen Gürteltieren hingegen paust sich der linear angeordnete Aufbau des Panzers durch., Die Knochenplättchen sind im Querschnitt mehrlagig aufgebaut, mit einer festen Knochenschicht oben und unten sowie weicherem Material innen, in dem sich Hohlräume für Schweiß- und Talgdrüsen sowie Knochenmark und bei behaarten Arten auch für Haarfollikel befinden. Generell haben die einzelnen Hohlräume je nach Funktion einen eigenen Charakter und können so auch bei fossilen Formen relativ sicher zugewiesen werden. Solche Haarfollikel sind zumeist langgestreckt und gruppieren sich am Rand des Osteoderms, Drüsen haben häufig eine kugel: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Gürteltiere, Säugetiergruppe, Gepanzerte Nebengelenktiere, Südamerika, Panzerbildung, Insekten, Nahrung, Fossilfunde, Körperbau, Schädel- und Gebissmerkmale, Körperpanzer"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},M=["disabled"],I={key:0},R={key:1};function N(n,e,h,u,r,o){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>r.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,r.searchQuery]]),r.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>r.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(o.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),o.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+l(r.searchQuery)+'".
