He has no standard ruler or compass, but he does have a device with which he can dissect the segment between two given points into ( m ) equal parts. For which ( m ) can Evan necessarily accomplish his task?","completion":"The given task requires Evan to construct the centroid of the vertices of a convex ( n )-gon using a device that can dissect a segment into ( m ) equal parts. We need to determine the acceptable values of ( m ). To address this, we can reinterpret the problem in terms of vector operations. Evan writes the ( n ) vectors ( (n, 0, 0, ldots), (0, n, 0, ldots), ldots, (0, 0, ldots, n) ) on a board. For any two vectors ( mathbf{a} ) and ( mathbf{b} ) on the board, Evan can create the vector ( frac{k}{m} mathbf{a} + frac{ell}{m} mathbf{b} ) where ( k ) and ( ell ) are nonnegative integers that sum to ( m ). The ultimate goal is to write the vector ( (1, 1, ldots, 1) ). We assert that Evan can achieve this goal if and only if ( m ) is divisible by 2 and every prime factor of ( n ). Proof of Necessity First, consider the necessity for ( m ) to be divisible by every prime factor of ( n ). Suppose ( p ) is a prime factor of ( n ). If ( m ) is not divisible by ( p ), then any linear combination ( frac{k}{m}mathbf{a} + frac{ell}{m}mathbf{b} ) will still leave entries on the board congruent to zero modulo ( p ). Hence, ( (1, 1, ldots, 1) ) cannot be achieved. Next, suppose ( n ) is odd. To show that ( m ) must be even, note that initially we write vectors that are permutations of ( (1, underbrace{0, ldots, 0}_{n-1}) pmod{2} ): [ {mathbf{v}_1, mathbf{v}_2, ldots, mathbf{v}_n} = {(1, 0, ldots, 0), (0, 1, ldots, 0), ldots, (0, 0, ldots, 1)}. ] The desired vector is ( (1, 1, ldots, 1) pmod{2} ). Since the vector operations are linear combinations of even terms or sums of pairs, it is evident that no new vectors modulo 2 can be formed unless ( m ) is even. Thus, if ( n ) is odd, ( m ) must be divisible by ( 2 ). Proof of Sufficiency We will now prove the sufficiency by demonstrating that if ( n = 2p ) (where ( p ) is an odd prime), then ( m = 2p ) is valid. Define an achievable multiset ( S ) as one whose elements are positive integers summing to ( 2p ), and for which it's feasible for Evan to produce the vector whose non-zero entries match the multiset's elements. Initially, the achievable multiset is ( S = {1, p-1, 1, p-1} ). The following operations preserve achievability: - **Operation a:** Replace an even ( k ) with two copies of ( frac{k}{2} ). - **Operation b:** Replace two different numbers ( k ) and ( ell ) of the same parity with two copies of ( frac{k + ell}{2} ). Since each move reduces the sum of the squares of the elements (as reassignment to smaller numbers occurs), at some state, no further operations can be conducted. This final state must consist of all odd and equal elements. Given that all numbers are less than ( p ), the achievable multiset reduces to ( S = {1, 1, ldots, 1} ), exactly yielding ( (1, 1, ldots, 1) ). Thus, the achievable ( m ) is if and only if ( m ) is divisible by 2 and every prime dividing ( n ).

Thus, the locus of point P is described by the equation x^{2}+y^{2}=4. Since there exists at least one point P on line l that satisfies angle APB=60^{circ}, line l: x+y+k=0 must intersect the locus x^{2}+y^{2}=4 at least once. Hence, the distance d from the circle's center to the line l is given by d=frac{|k|}{sqrt{2}} leq 2, which leads to -2sqrt{2} leq k leq 2sqrt{2}. Therefore, the range of values for k is boxed{[-2sqrt{2}, 2sqrt{2}]}. To elaborate, given angle APB=60^{circ} and OP=2, we deduce that the locus of point P is x^{2}+y^{2}=4.

For option C, if a parallel b, there are two possible relationships between a and alpha: either a parallel alpha or a subset alpha. Hence, it is not necessarily true that a parallel alpha. This makes option C incorrect. For option D, according to the theorem characterizing the parallelism of planes, if the corresponding lines in two planes are intersecting, then the planes are not parallel. Which means this option is also incorrect.

The plane formed by (triangle A_{1}B_{1}C_{2}) places (C_{1}) on one side and (A_{2}) and (B_{2}) on the other side. Thus, (C_{1}) and (C_{3}) appear on opposite sides, meaning line (C_{1}C_{3}) must intersect the plane. Hence, it must intersect (A_{1}A_{3}) and (B_{1}B_{3}) at point (M). 5. **Conclusion**: Since the three lines (A_{1}A_{3}), (B_{1}B_{3}), and (C_{1}C_{3}) intersect at a common point (M), they indeed converge to a single point. Therefore, we have demonstrated that the three lines intersect at one point, as required.

This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. The train is moving at a speed of 54 kmph (kilometers per hour). To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the speed to meters per second (m/s). 1 kilometer = 1000 meters 1 hour = 3600 seconds So, 54 kmph is equivalent to: 54 km/h * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) = 54 * 1000 / 3600 m/s Now, let's calculate the speed in m/s: 54 * 1000 / 3600 = 15 m/s The train takes 52.66245367037304 seconds to cross the bridge. To find the total distance covered during this time, we multiply the speed by the time: Distance = Speed * Time Distance = 15 m/s * 52.66245367037304 s Now, let's calculate the distance: Distance = 15 * 52.66245367037304 = 789.9368050555956 meters This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge.

Let's prove it for k. - Let's consider the largest fraction in the decomposition. It cannot be less than frac{1}{k}, otherwise the sum of all fractions would be less than frac{1}{}k. So, the denominator of this fraction is at most frac{k}{a}, meaning we have a finite number of values for the largest fraction. - For each of these values, we know by the induction hypothesis that the sum of the remaining 1 fractions can be fixed to any fixed value. - Therefore, the number of ways to represent a sum with k fractions is finite. 3. **Main Proof**: Now we will show that Petya can make a move such that Vasya can never make the sum on the board a natural number. - Assume before Petya's move, the sum of the numbers on the board is S. After Petya's move, Vasya will write k fractions. - Let's note that after Vasya's move, the sum won't exceed S+k+1, hence Vasya will not get a natural number greater than S+k+1. - For each remaining potential natural sum (their amount is finite), we will enumerate how much the current sum needs to be increased to become that. - As deduced from the lemma, for each such number there exists only a finite number of ways to achieve it using k+1 fractions of the form frac{1}{n}. - This implies that in all possible representations, only a finite number of fractions frac{1}{mathrm{n}} are involved. # Conclusion: Petya can always make a move to prevent Vasya from summing the fractions on the board to form a natural number. boxed{text{Yes, Petya can prevent Vasya from achieving his goal.}}"},{"prompt":"What is the largest possible distance between two points, one on the sphere of radius 23 with center (3, 15, 10), and the other on the sphere of radius 95 with center (7, 3, 19)?","completion":"Let (Q) be the center of the first sphere, and let (R) be the center of the second sphere.

To obtain exactly 2018 ways of representing ( n ) as a difference of squares, ( n ) must have exactly 2018 pairs ((k, m)) such that ( k cdot m = n ).

Specifically, the line (PX) intersects (Omega) at another point, say (P), which is such that the tangent at (P) on (Omega) is parallel to (UV). Similarly, the line (YV) intersects (Omega) at the same point (P). Thus, (Omega) is touched at some symmetric points leading to tangents at (C) and (D) being parallel. 5. **Circle's Intersections and Symmetry** We notice that the tangency and symmetry imply the angles involved between lines and tangents are congruent, leading to points (X, Y, U, V) being concyclic (cyclic quadrilateral properties can be applied here). 6. **Equality of Powers and Cyclic Considerations** Using properties of concyclic points, the power of point equations yield: [ PX cdot PU = PY cdot PV ] Since (P) lies on the line (AB) and coincides with one of the points (C) or (D), analogous reasoning applies to prove the situation for the other point on (Omega). 7. **Conclusion** Thus, the tangents to (Omega) at points (C) and (D) are indeed parallel to the common tangents of the first two circles. Thus, we conclude by boxing the statement because the proof concludes naturally the required results. (boxed{text{The tangents at points C and D to Omega are parallel to the common tangents of the first two circles}})"},{"prompt":"All 20 diagonals are drawn in a regular octagon.

Equality occurs when: [ (a + b - 0.5)^2 = 3ab ] Since ((a+b)) needs to equal (0.5), we test simpler cases if (a=0, b=0.5) or (a=0.5, b=0). # Conclusion: [ (a^2 + b^2 - a - b - ab + 0.25 geq 0) text{, equality holds for } (a=0 text{ and } b=0.5) text{ or } (a=0.5 text{ and } b=0). ] [ boxed{(a=0 text{ and } b=0.5) text{ or } (a=0.5 text{ and } b=0)} ]"},{"prompt":"Square EFGH in the coordinate plane has vertices at E(2,2), F(2,2), G(2,2), and H(2,2).

Step 2: **Compose Group Elements**: - Individual transformations are permutations of the vertices. - Combinations like LH, HR, etc., are possible but focus on achieving I after 24 transformations. Step 3: **Count Necessary Sequences**: - Each transformation’s order determines how often it must appear in a sequence to contribute to returning to the original configuration. - For 24 transformations, the orders imply that total occurrences of each transformation type must also collectively result in the identity. Step 4: **Calculate Number of Valid Sequences**: - The equation to solve becomes x + y + z + w = 24, where x, y, z, w are the counts for L, R, H, V, respectively. - Each of these counts must be even for the group to be at identity after all transformations.

This placement restricts certain positions on the board where no other piece can be placed. Specifically: - No piece can be placed in the first row. - No piece can be placed in the first column. - No piece can be placed on the diagonals passing through (1,1). The restricted positions after placing the first piece are: [ begin{array}{cccc} times & times & bigcirc & times times & bigcirc & bigcirc & bigcirc bigcirc & bigcirc & bigcirc & bigcirc times & bigcirc & bigcirc & bigcirc end{array} ] (Here, times represents restricted positions and bigcirc represents available positions.) 2. **Placing the Second Piece:** Now, choose an available position in the second row that is neither in the first column nor on any diagonal affected by the previous pieces. The most feasible choice is the position (2,3). After placing this second piece, the restricted positions are further updated: - No piece can be placed in the second row. - No piece can be placed in the third column. - No piece can be placed on the diagonals passing through (2,3). The restricted positions after placing the second piece are: [ begin{array}{cccc} times & times & times & times times & bigcirc & times & times times & times & times & bigcirc times & bigcirc & times & times end{array} ] 3. **Placing the Third Piece:** Next, move to the third row and choose a position that is neither in the first nor the third columns nor on any relevant diagonal. The most feasible choice here is (3,2). Placing the third chess piece there further restricts the positions: - No piece can be placed in the third row. - No piece can be placed in the second column. - No piece can be placed on the diagonals passing through (3,2). The restricted positions after placing the third piece are: [ begin{array}{cccc} times & times & times & times times & bigcirc & times & times times & times & times & times times & times & times & times end{array} ] 4. **Placing the Fourth Piece:** Finally, place the last piece in the only remaining feasible position, which is (4,4). This follows as: - The fourth row is empty. - The fourth column is empty. - No diagonals through (4,4) are conflicting with any previously placed pieces: The final configuration of pieces is: [ begin{array}{cccc} times & times & times & times times & bigcirc & times & times times & times & times & times times & times & times & P end{array} ] Thus, by following these steps, we successfully place 4 pieces on a 4 times 4 chessboard according to the given conditions.

Note that the denominator can be expressed as cos(2alpha) due to the double angle formula: frac {sinalpha cdot cosalpha}{cos^{2}alpha -sin^{2}alpha} = frac {frac{1}{2}sin(2alpha)}{cos(2alpha)} Now combining both simplified parts: 2cot alpha cdot frac {frac{1}{2}sin(2alpha)}{cos(2alpha)} = cot alpha cdot frac {sin(2alpha)}{cos(2alpha)} = cot alpha cdot tan(2alpha) Since cot alpha = 1 / tan alpha, then cot alpha cdot tan(2alpha) = 1 / tan alpha cdot tan(2alpha).

Therefore, we need to express cot alpha using the double angle for tangent, i.e. cot alpha = cot(2cdotfrac{alpha}{2}): = cot(2 cdot frac{alpha}{2}) cdot tan(2alpha) = frac{cos(2 cdot frac{alpha}{2})}{sin(2 cdot frac{alpha}{2})} cdot tan(2alpha) Recognizing that cos(2 cdot frac{alpha}{2}) = cos(alpha) and sin(2 cdot frac{alpha}{2}) = sin(alpha), this simplifies to: = frac{cos(alpha)}{sin(alpha)} cdot tan(2alpha) = cot(alpha) cdot tan(2alpha) Now considering the angle reduction formula tan(2alpha) = tan(alpha + alpha) = frac{tan alpha + tan alpha}{1 - tan^2 alpha}, we get: = cot(alpha) cdot frac{2 tan alpha}{1 - tan^2 alpha} = frac{cos(alpha)}{sin(alpha)} cdot frac{2 sin(alpha)/cos(alpha)}{1 - sin^2(alpha)/cos^2(alpha)} Canceling out the common terms and using the Pythagorean identity 1 - sin^2(alpha) = cos^2(alpha): = frac{2}{cos^2(alpha)} = 2sec^2(alpha) Recognizing that sec(alpha) is the reciprocal of cos(alpha), and since the double angle formula for cosine is given by cos(2alpha) = cos^2(alpha) - sin^2(alpha), we can rewrite the above as: = 2(1 + tan^2(alpha)) Since alpha = 45^circ makes tan(alpha) = 1, the final simplification is: = 2(1 + 1) = 2 cdot 2 = 4 Therefore, the simplified expression is boxed{4}."},{"prompt":"Danny and Steve are running towards each other, each one from his own house.

Let us choose ( a = 10^{1/2} ) and ( b = 2 log 11 ). 2.

Now, we need to prove that both ( 10^{1/2} ) and ( log 11 ) are irrational numbers. - For ( 10^{1/2} ): Suppose ( 10^{1/2} ) is rational, i.e., ( 10^{1/2} = frac{m}{n} ) for some natural numbers ( m ) and ( n ). Then: [ 10 = left(frac{m}{n}right)^2 implies 10n^2 = m^2 ] which implies that ( m^2 ) must be ten times a perfect square. However, ( 10n^2 ) must have a prime factorization including ( 2^1 ), while ( m^2 ) has ( 2^2k ) for some integer ( k ). This is a contradiction since even and odd powers of 2 cannot be equal. Thus, ( 10^{1/2} ) is irrational. - For ( log 11 ): Suppose ( log 11 ) is rational, i.e., ( log 11 = frac{m}{n} ) for some natural numbers ( m ) and ( n ). Then: [ 10^{m/n} = 11 implies 10^m = 11^n ] which is clearly impossible because ( 10^m ) and ( 11^n ) cannot be equal for any natural numbers ( m ) and ( n ) (since 10 and 11 are coprime). Thus, ( log 11 ) is irrational. # Second Solution: 1. Consider the number ( A = sqrt{2}^{sqrt{2}} ): - If ( A ) is rational, then we have already found our solution ( a = sqrt{2} ) and ( b = sqrt{2} ) because ( sqrt{2} ) is known to be irrational. - If ( A ) is irrational, consider: [ A^{sqrt{2}} = left(sqrt{2}^{sqrt{2}}right)^{sqrt{2}} = left(sqrt{2}right)^{2} = 2 ] which is a rational number.

This can be written as: [ a^2 + b^2 mid a^3 + 1 quad text{and} quad a^2 + b^2 mid b^3 + 1. ] 2. **Using Polynomial Identities**: Consider the expression (a^3 - b^3): [ a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2). ] Since (a^2 + b^2) divides both (a^3 + 1) and (b^3 + 1), it must also divide their difference: [ a^2 + b^2 mid (a^3 + 1) - (b^3 + 1) = a^3 - b^3. ] Therefore, [ a^2 + b^2 mid (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2). ] 3. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Analysis**: Let (gcd(a, b) = d).

Find the expected value and the variance of such a random variable.","completion":"1. **Definition and Setup**: - The random variable X is described by a binomial distribution, which represents the number of successes in n independent trials, where each trial has a probability p of success and q = 1 - p of failure. - In a binomial distribution, the probability that X takes the value m (i.e., X = m) is given by: P(X = m) = binom{n}{m} p^m q^{n-m}, where binom{n}{m} is the binomial coefficient. 2. **Expected Value Calculation**: - Consider X_i to be the indicator variable for the occurrence of the event A in the i-th trial. Thus, X = sum_{i=1}^n X_i. - Each X_i follows a Bernoulli distribution with P(X_i = 1) = p and P(X_i = 0) = q. This can be represented in the following probability table: begin{array}{c|c|c} X_i & 0 & 1 hline P(X_i) & q & p end{array} - The expected value of X_i, E[X_i], is calculated as: E[X_i] = 0 cdot q + 1 cdot p = p. - Since the trials are independent, the expected value of X is: E[X] = Eleft[sum_{i=1}^n X_iright] = sum_{i=1}^n E[X_i] = sum_{i=1}^n p = np. Thus, the expected value of the binomial random variable X is: E[X] = np. 3. **Variance Calculation**: - Using the independence of the X_is, the variance of X can be determined by summing the variances of each X_i: D[X] = text{Var}(X) = text{Var}left(sum_{i=1}^n X_iright) = sum_{i=1}^n text{Var}(X_i). - The variance of a Bernoulli random variable X_i is given by: text{Var}(X_i) = E[X_i^2] - (E[X_i])^2. - Since X_i can only take the values 0 and 1, X_i^2 = X_i. Therefore, E[X_i^2] = E[X_i] = p. - Plugging this into the variance formula, we get: text{Var}(X_i) = p - p^2 = p(1 - p) = pq. - Summing the variances for all n independent trials, we get: text{Var}(X) = sum_{i=1}^n text{Var}(X_i) = sum_{i=1}^n pq = npq. Therefore, the variance of the binomial random variable X is: text{Var}(X) = npq. # Conclusion: - The expected value of the binomial random variable X is: E[X] = np. - The variance of the binomial random variable X is: text{Var}(X) = npq.

Let's calculate this: g(e^{a-1}) = e^{a-1}ln(e^{a-1}) - a(e^{a-1} - 1) = (a-1)e^{a-1} - a(e^{a-1} - 1) = a - e^{a-1}. In summary: - For 0<aleq 1, the minimum value of g(x) is boxed{g(1)=0}. - For 1<a<2, the minimum value of g(x) is boxed{g(e^{a-1})=a-e^{a-1}}. - For ageq 2, the minimum value of g(x) is boxed{g(e)=e(1-a)}."},{"prompt":"The lengths of the sides of a triangle form a geometric sequence with a common ratio ( q ).

When m>0, f(x) is an upward-opening parabola, and we need to find the range of a such that the minimum value of f(x) is less than or equal to 0.

The minimum value of f(x) is f_{min}(x)=frac{4m(-m-a)-1}{4m}=-m-a-frac{1}{4m}.

Find all such triangles.","completion":"We are given that the lengths of the sides of a certain triangle and the diameter of its inscribed circle form four consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression. To solve this problem, we perform the following steps: 1. **Define the triangle sides and in-radius diameter**: Let the sides of the triangle be (a), (b), and (c). Let the diameter of the inscribed circle be (2r). 2. **Arithmetic sequence properties**: By the problem’s statement, (2r), (a), (b), and (c) form an increasing arithmetic sequence with a common difference (d > 0). This gives us: [ a = 2r + d, quad b = 2r + 2d, quad c = 2r + 3d ] 3. **Semi-perimeter relation**: Calculate the semi-perimeter (p) of the triangle: [ p = frac{a + b + c}{2} = frac{(2r + d) + (2r + 2d) + (2r + 3d)}{2} = frac{6r + 6d}{2} = 3r + 3d ] 4. **Area of the triangle, using inradius**: The area (S) of the triangle can be expressed using the inradius (r) and the semi-perimeter (p): [ S = pr = (3r + 3d) r ] 5. **Area using Heron's formula**: Alternatively, the area (S) can also be calculated using Heron's formula: [ S = sqrt{p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c)} ] Substitute the expressions for (a), (b), and (c) and simplify: [ S = sqrt{(3r + 3d) (3r + 3d - (2r + d)) (3r + 3d - (2r + 2d)) (3r + 3d - (2r + 3d))} ] [ S = sqrt{(3r + 3d) (r + 2d) (r + d) r} ] 6. **Equating the two expressions for area**: Since both expressions represent the same area, equate them: [ (3r + 3d) r = sqrt{(3r + 3d) (r + 2d) (r + d) r} ] Square both sides to remove the square root: [ [(3r + 3d) r]^2 = (3r + 3d)(r + 2d)(r + d) r ] Simplify and cancel out terms (assuming (r neq 0)): [ (3r + 3d)^2 r^2 = (3r + 3d) (r + 2d) (r + d) r ] [ (3r + 3d)r^2 = (r + 2d)(r + d) ] Since (3r + 3d neq 0): [ 3r^2 + 3dr = r^2 + 3rd + 2d^2 ] Collect all terms on one side: [ 3r^2 + 3dr = r^2 + 3rd + 2d^2 ] Simplify further: [ 2r^2 = 2d^2 ] Thus: [ r^2 = d^2 ] 7. **Determine the positive values**: Since (r > 0) and (d > 0), we have: [ r = d ] 8. **Final relationship between triangle sides**: Substituting (r = d) into the expressions for (a), (b), and (c): [ a = 3r, quad b = 4r, quad c = 5r ] 9. **Conclusion**: The sides of the triangle are in the proportion (3:4:5), which is characteristic of a right triangle (an Egyptian triangle).

The expression for ( B ) becomes: [ B = 2^{2k} cdot (n+1) = 2^{2k} cdot (2k + 1) ] For ( B ) to be a perfect square, ( (2k + 1) ) must be a perfect square.

D: To obtain the graph of the function y = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sin x, one only needs to stretch the xcoordinate of the graph of function f(x) by a factor of 2 and then shift it to the right by frac{pi}{4} units.","completion":"To solve this problem, let's break down the transformation of the function f(x) = cos^2x + sin x cos x - frac{1}{2} step by step: 1. **Simplifying the given function:** Given f(x) = cos^2x + sin x cos x - frac{1}{2}, we can use trigonometric identities to simplify it. First, we use the identity cos^2x = frac{cos 2x + 1}{2} to rewrite cos^2x. Then, we use the double angle identity sin 2x = 2sin x cos x to rewrite sin x cos x as frac{1}{2} sin 2x. Putting these together, we get: f(x) = frac{cos 2x + 1}{2} + frac{1}{2} sin 2x - frac{1}{2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}(frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sin 2x + frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cos 2x). Using the sum-to-product identity, we can further simplify this to: f(x) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sin(2x + frac{pi}{4}). 2. **Analyzing the maximum value:** The maximum value of sin function is 1, so the maximum value of f(x) is frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. Therefore, statement A is incorrect. 3. **Determining the period and symmetry:** The function sin(2x + frac{pi}{4}) has a period of T = frac{2pi}{2} = pi, which means the distance between two adjacent axes of symmetry of graph C is frac{T}{2} = frac{pi}{2}. Thus, statement B is correct. Since f(-frac{pi}{8}) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sin[2 times (-frac{pi}{8}) + frac{pi}{4}] = 0, the graph C is symmetric about the point (-frac{pi}{8}, 0), making statement C correct. 4. **Transforming the function to obtain another:** By stretching the x-coordinate of f(x) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sin(2x + frac{pi}{4}) by a factor of 2 and keeping the y-coordinate unchanged, we get y = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sin(x + frac{pi}{4}). Shifting this to the right by frac{pi}{4} units results in y = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sin x, which confirms that statement D is correct. Therefore, the correct statements are B, C, and D.

The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by: [ x = -frac{b}{2a} = -frac{m}{2} ] For the vertex to be negative, -frac{m}{2} must be negative, which implies m must be positive.

Suppose ((x, y, z)) is a solution, then for any integer (k), ((kx, ky, kz)) is also a solution. **Example:** We consider ((x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3)). Substituting into the equation: [ x^2 + 2y^2 = 1^2 + 2 cdot 2^2 = 1 + 8 = 9 ] [ z^2 = 3^2 = 9 ] So, ((1, 2, 3)) is indeed a solution.

Thus, consider the equation: [ x^2 + 2y^2 equiv z^2 pmod{8} ] Now, (2y^2 mod 8) takes values either (0, 2, 4,) or (6). Checking congruency: - If (y^2 equiv 0 pmod{4}), (2y^2 equiv 0 pmod{8}). - If (y^2 equiv 1 pmod{4}), (2y^2 equiv 2 pmod{8}). - If (y^2 equiv 4 pmod{8}), (2y^2 equiv 8 equiv 0 pmod{8}). Analyzing this modulo 8, we see it impossible for (z^2) to match (x^2 + 2). Therefore, this implies (y) must be even. Similarly, examining the second equation modulo 8: [ 2x^2 + y^2 equiv t^2 pmod{8} ] Yields, (2) for same argument, leading (x) to be even. Contradicting that (x) and (y) are coprimes. Hence, descent to (left(frac{x}{2}, frac{y}{2}, frac{z}{2}, frac{t}{2}right)), implying all integers become even iteratively contradicts minimality, ruling modulo approach invalid. - **Modulo 3 Argument:** Considering sum of both: [ 3(x^2 + y^2) = z^2 + t^2 ] Squaring terms modulo 3 resolves to either: - (0 equiv z^2 + t^2 pmod{3}) - Both implying (z), (t) multiples of (3 equiv pmod{3}).

Specifically, the question is whether participant 2 is a chemist or an alchemist. 3. **Initial assumption**: Suppose participant n is the first one who considers their right neighbor, participant n+1, to be an alchemist. Before this point, all previous participants from 1 to n-1 consider their right neighbors to be chemists. 4. **Identify the first suspected alchemist**: Given this scenario, participants n and n+1 are called into a separate line. The mathematician now solely focuses on participant n-1 and questions them about their new right neighbor (which has shifted due to arranging n and n+1 together). 5. **Continue the process**: This process continues, bringing each new participant (considered to be an alchemist by their immediate left neighbor) into the special line until a point where everyone in the initial line believes their right neighbor is a chemist. 6. **Formation of the special line**: The individuals called into the special line each time are always perceived by their left neighbor (in the original line) as alchemists. Hence, it can be deduced that: - Among the pairs in the special line, there is at least one alchemist since a chemist would always tell the truth. - Within the remaining people (outside the special line), chemists still outnumber alchemists.

Therefore, ( angle OPX ) equals ( angle OXP ). Let us name these angles as ( x^circ ). 2. **Vertically Opposite Angles:** - Since ( angle APZ ) and ( angle OPX ) are vertically opposite angles, we obtain that ( angle APZ = angle OPX = x^circ ). 3. **Equilateral Triangle Property:** - Because ( triangle ABC ) is an equilateral triangle, each interior angle is ( 60^circ ).

In our equation, x^{5} + px + q = 0, the constant term is q and the leading coefficient is 1. Thus, any rational root must be an integer. 2. **Possible Integer Roots**: - We denote the possible integer roots of the equation by x. We need to find the range for x. - Consider the cases when x geq 0: [ x^{5} + px + q geq q geq 1 > 0 ] Hence, no non-negative x can be a root. - Consider the cases when x leq -3: [ x^{5} + px + q leq -3^{5} - 3p + q < -3^{5} - 3 + 100 < 0 ] Hence, no x leq -3 can be a root. - Therefore, the only possible integer values for x are x = -1 or x = -2. 3. **Substitution and Solutions**: - **For x = -1**: [ (-1)^{5} + p(-1) + q = 0 ] Simplifying, we get: [ -1 - p + q = 0 implies q = p + 1 ] Values of p range from 1 to 99 (since p leq 100 and thus q = p + 1 leq 100). Therefore, there are 99 pairs (p, q) satisfying this condition. - **For x = -2**: [ (-2)^{5} + p(-2) + q = 0 ] Simplifying, we get: [ -32 - 2p + q = 0 implies q = 2p + 32 ] Values of p range from 1 to 34 (since 2p + 32 leq 100 gives p leq 34). Therefore, there are 34 pairs (p, q) satisfying this condition. 4. **Total Pairs**: - Since the conditions q = p + 1 and q = 2p + 32 cannot be satisfied for the same p simultaneously, all pairs identified are unique. 5. **Conclusion**: - The total number of pairs of values (p, q) such that the equation has rational solutions is: [ 99 + 34 = 133 ] [ boxed{133} ]"},{"prompt":"Albert has 9 bottle caps.

Work rate for 10 workers for 10 days: frac{1}{4} of the job. Work rate for 10 workers for 1 day: frac{1}{4} div 10 = frac{1}{40} of the job.

Consider the acute angle B_1 O B_2 between axes l_1 and l_2, and assume the direction of rotation from l_1 to l_2 is positive. 4.

Notice that widehat{AO B_1} = widehat{B_1 O A_1} and widehat{A_1 O B_2} = widehat{B_2 O A_2}. 6. Therefore, [ widehat{B_1 O A_1} + widehat{A_1 O B_2} = widehat{B_1 O B_2} = frac{alpha}{2} ] 7.

We now focus on analyzing some strategic sets. 3. **Lemma:** When all roads in such a set are closed, the graph will split into exactly two connected components, with none of the roads within these components being closed. 4. **Proof of Lemma:** Closing the strategic set of roads breaks the graph into connected components. Because the set is important, there would be at least two components.

By closing road (a) and having (Z) as the third component. Removing (a) from the strategic set, as there were previously no strategic sets smaller, it leads to contradiction. If (a) is removed, connectivity won't be affected, ensuring only two components exist rather than three. 6. **Component Consideration:** Moving forward to roads within a component, if removing internal roads doesn't dip below the strategic threshold maintaining connectivity, another contradiction arises, confirming no roads within a component would form a strategic set mislabeled earlier. 7. **Set Articulation:** Let the first strategic set divides the bases into subsets (A) and (B), while the second divides into subsets (C) and (D).

Consider a triangle with sides (a, b,) and (c) where (a < 1), (b < 1), and (c < 1). Let's denote the smallest angle of the triangle by (alpha). 2. By the property of triangles, the sum of the angles in any triangle is (180^circ). So, we have: [ alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ ] where (alpha), (beta), and (gamma) are the angles of the triangle and (alpha) is the smallest angle. 3. Since (alpha) is the smallest angle, we have: [ alpha leq 60^circ ] This is because if all angles were greater than (60^circ), their sum would exceed (180^circ), which is not possible. 4. Now, the area (S) of the triangle can be given by: [ S = frac{1}{2} b c sin alpha ] 5. Since (b < 1) and (c < 1), the maximum value of (b cdot c) is when (b) and (c) approach 1 from below. Thus: [ b c < 1 ] 6. Therefore, we can write: [ S leq frac{1}{2} cdot 1 cdot sin alpha ] [ S leq frac{1}{2} sin alpha ] 7. Given that (alpha leq 60^circ), we substitute the maximum value of (sin alpha), which is (sin 60^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}).

Notice that, aside from C, the circumcircles intersect at another distinct point K. We claim that B, D, E, and K are concyclic. 3. Suppose K neq B and K neq D (assuming K coincides with either would immediately prove the desired result). 4. Since C, F, and K are distinct points on the circumcircle of triangle CDF, and A, F, C are distinct collinear points, it follows that K neq A. This implies K is distinct from points A, B, C, and D. 5. Connect points BK, CK, and DK. We have angle EBK = angle EDK. 6. Therefore, B, E, K, D are concyclic, proving K lies on the circumcircles of triangle ABC, triangle CDF, and triangle BDE simultaneously in this scenario. **Scenario 2:** The circumcircles of triangle ABC and triangle CDF intersect internally at point C. 1. It is sufficient to prove that B, C, D, E lie on a common circle. 2. Let line segment BC intersect the circumcircle of triangle CDF at point M. 3. Given that A and B correspond to points F and M with C as the center of this rotation, their relationships suggest frac{AF}{AB} is similar to frac{FM}{BC} because angles angle ABC and angle FMC are preserved under the rotation. 4. Since quadrilateral CDFM is cyclic, angle FMC + angle FDC = 180^circ. 5. Given that angle ABC = angle FMC, we have angle ABC + angle EDC = 180^circ. 6. Therefore, B, C, D, E are concyclic, proving they lie on the same circumcircle.

Next, let’s find: [ P Q: frac{1}{2} t x - y +2 = 0 ] So, solving for the fixed point, we'll check: [ x = 0 , quad y = 2] This implies line (PQ) always passes through the point ((0,2)). **Conclusion** [ boxed{(0,2)} ] Thus, (PQ) passes through a fixed point. # Part 2: 7.

To find the minimum value of x+y, recognise that the sum x+y is minimized when the line y=-x+b is tangent to the circle and as low as possible (since the slope of y=-x+b is -1). The point of tangency (x_0, y_0) between the line y=-x+b and the circle will minimize the sum x_0+y_0. To find this point, we set up the following system: [ begin{cases} sqrt{(x_0-2)^2 + (y_0-1)^2} = 1 y_0 = -x_0 + b end{cases} ] Substituting the second equation into the first: [ sqrt{(x_0-2)^2 + (-x_0 + b-1)^2} = 1 ] Squaring both sides, we get: [ (x_0-2)^2 + (-x_0 + b-1)^2 = 1 ] Expanding and simplifying this equation yield a relationship between x_0 and b. However, since the coefficient of x_0^2 is 2 when we expand the equation due to the square on both x_0 - 2 and -x_0 + b - 1, we know that the curve intersects only at one point with the tangent line for which it acts like a quadratic equation with only one real solution. In such a case, the discriminant must be zero: D = (2b-6)^2 - 4 cdot 2 cdot (b^2-4b+4-1) = 0 Solving for b to find its value when the discriminant is zero: D = 4b^2 - 24b + 36 - 8b^2 + 32b - 32 = 0 Simplifying, -4b^2 + 8b + 4 = 0 Dividing by -4, b^2 - 2b - 1 = 0 Solving the quadratic equation, (b-1)^2 = 2 b - 1 = sqrt{2} or b - 1 = -sqrt{2} But since we are searching for the minimum value of b, we take b = 1 - sqrt{2}. The smallest value for x+y will occur when b is minimized. Since at the point of tangency, we have y_0=x_0+b, the minimum value can now be computed: x_0 + y_0 = x_0 + (-x_0 + 1 - sqrt{2}) Therefore, the minimum value of x+y is 1 - sqrt{2}. But we've made a mistake in our algebra. The correct value of b should allow us to find the minimum sum x_0+y_0. To correct this, we should consider both values of b and evaluate the sum for both points of tangency. Since the line y=-x+b will have a higher y-intercept when b is larger, we actually need to take b = 1 + sqrt{2}. At the point of tangency, we have y_0=-x_0+b, so the minimum sum is: x_0 + y_0 = x_0 + (-x_0 + 1 + sqrt{2}) x_0 + y_0 = 1 + sqrt{2} However, we need the minimum value and since 1 + sqrt{2} is clearly more than 2, our approach so far is not yielding the correct result. Let's try a simpler geometric approach since the circle has a radius of 1 and is centered at (2,1), the point on the circle that will yield the minimum value for x+y (due to symmetry and the line y=-x+b) must lie on the line y=x. This is because any point below the line y=x will have a corresponding point above the line with the same sum x+y. Using the fact that the minimum x+y will occur on the line y=x, we set y = x and substitute it into the circle equation: sqrt{(x-2)^2 + (x-1)^2} = 1 Square both sides: (x-2)^2 + (x-1)^2 = 1 Expand and combine terms: x^2 - 4x + 4 + x^2 - 2x + 1 = 1 2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0 Factor out 2: x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 This can be factored further: (x - 1)(x - 2) = 0 So x = 1 or x = 2.

To prove uniqueness, we note that the function ( f(x) = frac{1}{1 + x^m} ) is strictly decreasing on ( (0, 1) ). Therefore, the value of the integral ( I_m ) is strictly decreasing as ( c_m ) increases. This implies that for each ( m ), there is a unique ( c_m ) such that: [ int_0^1 frac{dx}{1 + x^m} = frac{1}{1 + c_m^m} ] 2. **Calculation of the Limit:** We need to calculate: [ lim_{k to infty} k c_k^k ] From the given integral equation, we have: [ int_0^1 frac{dx}{1 + x^m} = frac{1}{1 + c_m^m} ] As ( m to infty ), the integral ( I_m ) can be approximated by considering the behavior of the integrand near ( x = 1 ). For large ( m ), the integrand ( frac{1}{1 + x^m} ) is close to 1 for ( x ) near 0 and drops sharply to 0 as ( x ) approaches 1.

Find all points P not on the xy plane that satisfy the following condition: There exist points A,B,C on omega such that angle APB = angle APC = angle BPC = 90^circ.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find all points ( P ) not on the ( xy )-plane such that there exist points ( A, B, C ) on the unit circle ( omega ) in the ( xy )-plane satisfying ( angle APB = angle APC = angle BPC = 90^circ ). 2. **Geometric Interpretation:** Consider the unit circle ( omega ) in the ( xy )-plane. Let ( A, B, C ) be points on ( omega ). The condition ( angle APB = angle APC = angle BPC = 90^circ ) implies that ( P ) is the orthocenter of the triangle ( triangle ABC ) when projected onto the ( xy )-plane. 3. **Projection onto the ( xy )-plane:** Let ( H ) be the orthocenter of ( triangle ABC ). The orthocenter ( H ) lies in the ( xy )-plane. The point ( P ) must be such that its projection onto the ( xy )-plane is ( H ). 4. **Distance from the ( xy )-plane:** Let ( P = (x, y, z) ). The projection of ( P ) onto the ( xy )-plane is ( (x, y, 0) ). Since ( H ) is the orthocenter of ( triangle ABC ), we have ( (x, y, 0) = H ). 5. **Power of a Point:** The power of the orthocenter ( H ) with respect to the unit circle ( omega ) is given by: [ text{Pow}(H) = OH^2 - 1 ] where ( O ) is the origin.

Therefore, all these terms leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 13. The last term in the expansion is 1, which leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 13. Given that 51^{2022} + a is divisible by 13, we know that 51^{2022} leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 13. Let's denote the remainder when 51^{2022} + a is divided by 13 as R.

The roots are where y=0, which occurs at x=m and x=3-m. The axis of symmetry, x_{text{axis}}, is the average of these roots: [ x_{text{axis}} = frac{(m) + (3-m)}{2} = frac{3}{2} ] **Step 2: Analyze the relationship between x_{1}+x_{2} and the axis of symmetry.** - **Case 1:** When x_{1}+x_{2}=3, points A and B are symmetric about the axis of symmetry. This means y_{1}=y_{2} because each point is an equal distance from the axis of symmetry on either side. - **Case 2:** When x_{1}+x_{2} gt 3, point B is farther from the axis of symmetry than point A (since x_{1} < x_{2} and the sum is greater than the axis of symmetry). Because the parabola opens upwards, the farther a point is from the axis of symmetry, the higher its y-value. Therefore, in this case, y_{1} lt y_{2}. - **Case 3:** When x_{1}+x_{2} lt 3, point B is closer to the axis of symmetry than point A. Since the parabola opens upwards, the closer a point is to the axis of symmetry, the lower its y-value (compared to points farther away but at the same horizontal distance from the axis). Therefore, in this case, y_{1} gt y_{2}. **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the statement that correctly describes the relationship between x_{1}+x_{2} and y_{1}, y_{2} is: B: If x_{1}+x_{2} lt 3, then y_{1} gt y_{2}. This is because, given the parabola opens upwards and the axis of symmetry is at x=frac{3}{2}, points closer to the axis (in this case, when their sum is less than 3) will have a higher y-value compared to points farther away.

The detailed proof involves integrating the surface area element over the segment, which is a straightforward calculus exercise. (blacksquare) 2. **Lemma 2**: Let a *disk of radius (rho) and center (P)* be the set of points on (mathbb{S}^2) whose spherical distance from (P) is at most (rho). Any such disk has spherical area (2(1-cos rho)pi), as long as (rho le pi). *Proof*: This follows from Lemma 1. The area of a spherical cap (disk) of radius (rho) on a unit sphere is given by the formula (2pi(1 - cos rho)). (blacksquare) 3. **Lemma 3**: For any (n), it is always possible to find (rho) and (P_1, P_2, cdots, P_n) such that (D_1, D_2, cdots, D_n) do not intersect (except for possibly along their boundaries), but such that any disk of radius (rho) intersects one of the (D_i) (possibly along their boundaries). *Proof*: We describe an algorithm. We start with (n=1, rho = pi,) and a single point (P_1). Now we continuously decrease (rho), and add a new disk of radius (rho) as early as possible such that it does not intersect any of the disks already present (except for possibly along their boundaries). If for some value of (rho) it is possible to add multiple disks, we do so greedily. The \\"as early as possible\\" moment always exists because the spherical distance function always has a global maximum. (blacksquare) 4. **Lemma 4**: Suppose we have (n) disks (D_1, D_2, cdots, D_n) such that no two of them intersect (except for possibly along their boundaries), but such that any disk of radius (rho) intersects one of the (D_i) (possibly along their boundaries). Then (frac{2}{1-cos 2rho} le n le frac{2}{1-cos rho}). *Proof*: Note that if we define (closed) disks (D_1', D_2', cdots, D_n') with radius (2rho) and the same centers as (D_1, D_2, cdots, D_n), then the disks (D_i') cover all of (mathbb{S}^2). Indeed, if there is some point (X) on (mathbb{S}^2) that is not in disk (D_i'), then we could add a new disk (D_{n+1}) with radius (rho) centered at (X) that does not intersect any of (D_1, D_2,cdots, D_n), contradiction. Hence the sum of the areas of the (D_i') is at least (4pi); i.e. (n(2(1-cos 2rho)pi) ge 4pi), implying that (n ge frac{2}{1-cos 2rho}). To finish, note the obvious fact that the sum of the areas of the (D_i) is at most (4pi), so (n le frac{2}{1-cos rho}). (blacksquare) 5. **Lemma 5**: To each point (X) on (mathbb{S}^2) we associate a bar (f(X)) of width (w) such that the two boundary planes of the bar are parallel to the tangent plane to (mathbb{S}^2) at (X). Then (A) is in (f(B)) if and only if (B) is in (f(A)). *Proof*: Note that (A) is in (f(B)) if and only if (|vec{A} cdot vec{B}| le w'), where (w') is some constant depending only on (w). This condition is symmetric, so we are done. (blacksquare) 6. By Lemma 5, it suffices to find a set of (n) points (Q_1, Q_2, cdots, Q_n) such that any bar contains at least one, but not more than (csqrt{n}) of the (Q_i). We have (rho) and our disks (D_i) from before. I claim that we can take (omega = 4.002rho) and (Q_i = P_i). It's clear that any bar must contain at least one of the (P_i) (otherwise we could find a new disk (D_{n+1}), centered with respect to the bar, that does not intersect any of (D_1,D_2, cdots, D_n)). Supposing that (P_i) is inside the bar, at least half of disk (D_i) must lie inside the bar. Note that (w = 2sin frac{omega}{2}), so the total area of the bar is (4pisinfrac{omega}{2} = 4pisin 2.001rho). Supposing that there are (m) points (P_i) inside the bar, we have (mleft(frac{1}{2}(2(1-cosrho)pi)right)le 4pisin 2.001rho), implying that [ m le 4frac{sin 2.001 rho}{1-cos rho}. ] Combining this with our estimate (n ge frac{2}{1-cos 2rho}) from Lemma 4, the result would follow from the existence of a constant (c) satisfying [ left(frac{sin 2rho}{1-cosrho}right)^2(1-cos 2rho) le c ] for all sufficiently small (rho).

We need to determine how many sides in a convex polygon can be equal to its largest diagonal. 2. Let us consider possible configurations for convex polygons. (textbf{Case 1:}) Suppose one side of the polygon is equal to the largest diagonal. Clearly, this is possible, as any polygon can have at least one side of maximum length among its diagonals. (textbf{Case 2:}) Now suppose two sides of the polygon are equal to the largest diagonal. This is more complicated. Consider two sides of the polygon, say side (AB) and (BC). If both are equal to the largest diagonal, then (AB = BC). These sides must meet at a vertex (B). The geometry and overall structure of the polygon must still remain valid and convex. We can visualize a case where these two sides together form an angle less than 180 degrees, maintaining the convex nature of the polygon. Hence, two sides equal to the largest diagonal can exist. 3. However, when considering three or more sides equal to the largest diagonal, issues arise. For three sides to equal the largest diagonal, each pair of these sides must share a common vertex, forming a kind of star formation. This configuration introduces the following problem: - If three sides are equal to the largest diagonal and each side shares a vertex with another, this would form a sort of closed cycle around that central vertex and distort the convex nature of the polygon. Due to the restrictions of convex shapes, maintaining three equal sides of maximum length geometrically forces them into a triangle structure, which violates the polygon’s definition. Hence, not possible for a convex polygon without defaulting to a triangle. 4. Therefore, it is confirmed that: - One side equal to the largest diagonal is possible. - Two sides equal to the largest diagonal are also possible. - Three or more sides equal to the largest diagonal are impossible due to the convex restriction. # Conclusion Thus, a convex polygon can have either no sides, one side, or two sides equal to its largest diagonal.

So, the total original cost is P times Q. After a 25% increase in the price of gasoline, the new price becomes P + 0.25P = 1.25P per unit. The driver intends to spend only 5% more on gasoline, so the new total cost that the driver is willing to spend is (P times Q) + 0.05(P times Q) = 1.05(P times Q). Now, let's find out how many units of gasoline the driver can buy with the new total cost at the new price. Let the new quantity of gasoline be Q'. We have: [1.05(P times Q) = 1.25P times Q'] To find Q', we divide both sides by 1.25P: [Q' = frac{1.05(P times Q)}{1.25P}] Simplify the equation by canceling out P: [Q' = frac{1.05Q}{1.25}] [Q' = frac{1.05}{1.25}Q] [Q' = 0.84Q] This means the driver can now buy 84% of the original quantity of gasoline.

Let's define h(x) = xcos x - sin x and find its derivative: h'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(xcos x - sin x) = cos x - (xsin x + cos x) = -xsin x. For x in (-pi, 0), since -x > 0 and sin x < 0, we have h'(x) = -xsin x > 0, indicating h(x) is monotonically increasing in this interval. However, this is incorrect based on the standard solution; let's correct it: for x in (-pi, 0), h'(x) < 0, so h(x) is monotonically decreasing. Similarly, for x in (0, pi), since sin x > 0, we have h'(x) = -xsin x < 0, indicating h(x) is monotonically decreasing in this interval as well. Therefore, for x in (-pi, 0), since h(x) is decreasing and h(0) = 0, we have h(x) > h(0) = 0, which implies f'(x) > 0. For x in (0, pi), since h(x) < h(0) = 0, we have f'(x) < 0. Hence, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (-pi, 0) and monotonically decreasing on (0, pi). Part (Ⅱ) - Range of Values for m Given mf(x) = g(x), we have: frac{msin x}{x} = mcos x - x. This simplifies to: x^2 - mxcos x + msin x = 0. Let F(x) = x^2 - mxcos x + msin x. We need F(x) to have exactly one zero on (0, frac{3pi}{2}).

This implies F(x) is monotonically increasing, and since F(0) = 0, F(x) has no zeros in (0, frac{3pi}{2}). 2. **When m > 2**, setting F'(x) = 0 gives sin x = -frac{2}{m}, which lies in (-1, 0).

A: 6 B: 5 C: 4 D: 3","completion":"To solve the problem, we first need to understand how the annual profit is calculated and how it changes over time. Let's break down the solution into detailed steps: 1. **Setting up the Operating Cost Sequence:** - Given that the operating cost in the first year is 20,000 (or 2 in thousands of dollars) and it increases by 20,000 (2 in thousands of dollars) each year, we can conclude that the operating cost forms an arithmetic sequence. - The first term of this arithmetic sequence (a_1) is 2, and the common difference (d) is also 2. - Therefore, the operating cost in the nth year (a_n) can be expressed as: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d = 2 + (n-1) times 2 = 2n 2. **Calculating the Total Operating Cost Over n Years:** - The total operating cost for n years is the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic sequence, which can be calculated using the formula T_n = dfrac{n}{2} [2a_1 + (n-1)d]. - Substituting a_1 = 2 and d = 2, we get: T_n = dfrac{n}{2} [2 times 2 + (n-1) times 2] = dfrac{n}{2} [4 + 2n - 2] = dfrac{n}{2} [2n + 2] = n(n + 1) - Thus, the total operating cost for n years is T_n = n^2 + n (in thousands of dollars). 3. **Determining the Total Profit After n Years:** - The annual revenue generated by the equipment is 110,000 (or 11 in thousands of dollars). - The initial cost of the equipment is 90,000 (or 9 in thousands of dollars), which is a one-time cost. - Therefore, the total profit after n years (S_n) can be calculated as the total revenue minus the total operating costs and the initial cost: S_n = 11n - (n^2 + n) - 9 = -n^2 + 10n - 9 4. **Calculating the Annual Average Profit:** - The annual average profit is the total profit over n years divided by the number of years, n. - Substituting the expression for S_n, we get: text{Annual Average Profit} = dfrac{-n^2 + 10n - 9}{n} = 10 - left(n + dfrac{9}{n}right) 5. **Maximizing the Annual Average Profit:** - To maximize the annual average profit, we need to find the value of n that maximizes the expression 10 - left(n + dfrac{9}{n}right). - By analyzing this expression, we can see that when n=3, the decrease from 10 due to the terms n + dfrac{9}{n} is minimized, resulting in the maximum average profit. - Therefore, the maximum annual average profit is achieved after the equipment has been used for 3 years.

We need to prove that for any natural number ( n ), ( left|z^{2n} - 1right| ) is a real number. 1. **Express ( z ) in polar form**: Since ( |z| = 1 ), we can write: [ z = costheta + i sintheta ] Here, ( cos theta ) and ( sin theta ) are real numbers such that ( cos^2theta + sin^2theta = 1 ). 2. **Raise ( z ) to the power ( 2n )**: Using De Moivre's Theorem, which states ( (cos theta + i sin theta)^n = cos(ntheta) + i sin(ntheta) ), we have: [ z^{2n} = (cos theta + i sin theta)^{2n} = cos (2ntheta) + i sin (2ntheta) ] 3. **Calculate ( left|z^{2n} - 1 right| )**: Notice that: [ 1 = cos 0 + i sin 0 ] Therefore: [ z^{2n} - 1 = (cos (2ntheta) + i sin (2ntheta)) - (cos 0 + i sin 0) = cos (2ntheta) - 1 + i sin (2ntheta) ] 4. **Find the magnitude**: The magnitude (left|z^{2n} - 1right|) can be written as: [ left|z^{2n} - 1right| = sqrt{(cos (2ntheta) - 1)^2 + (sin (2ntheta))^2} ] 5. **Simplify the expression**: Using the Pythagorean identity, (cos^2 (2ntheta) + sin^2 (2ntheta) = 1), we have: [ left|z^{2n} - 1right| = sqrt{(cos (2ntheta) - 1)^2 + (1 - cos^2 (2ntheta))} ] Simplifying inside the square root: [ = sqrt{cos^2 (2ntheta) - 2cos (2ntheta) + 1 + sin^2 (2ntheta)} ] [ = sqrt{cos^2 (2ntheta) + sin^2 (2ntheta) - 2cos (2ntheta) + 1} ] [ = sqrt{1 - 2cos (2ntheta) + 1} ] [ = sqrt{2 - 2cos (2ntheta)} ] Using the identity (cos(2theta) = 1 - 2sin^2(theta)), we get: [ 2 - 2cos (2ntheta) = 2 (1 - cos (2ntheta)) = 2(1 - (1 - 2 sin^2 (n theta))) = 4 sin^2 (n theta) ] (left|z^{2n} - 1right| = sqrt{4 sin^2 ntheta} = 2|sin ntheta|) 6. **Conclusion**: Since ( sin (ntheta) ) is real for all ( n in mathbb{N} ), and the factor ( 2 ) is real, ( left|z^{2n} - 1 right| = 2 left|sin (ntheta) right| ) is real.

The quadratic u^2 + 6u + 1 is always positive because it opens upwards (coefficient of u^2 is positive) and the vertex is negative: [ u = -frac{b}{2a} = -frac{6}{2} = -3. ] Since the vertex is at u = -3, the quadratic is positive for all u geq 0. 5. **Conclusion**: Since K^4 + 6K^2 + 1 geq 0 for all real K, the original quadratic equation has real roots for all real values of K.

Suppose ( B_i ) and ( B_j ) are adjacent. - The segment ( B_iB_j ) either red or green leads to a contradiction: - If ( B_iB_j ) is red, we get an all-red triangle ( A_2B_iB_j ). - If ( B_iB_j ) is green, we get an all-green triangle ( A_1B_iB_j ). 5. **Conclusion for ( A_i )**: Hence, under every possible scenario, we encounter a contradiction. This contradiction implies that our initial assumption is false. Therefore, all edges in ( A_1A_2A_3A_4A_5 ) must indeed be of the same color. 6. **Repeating Argument for ( B_i )**: By a symmetric argument, it follows that all edges in ( B_1B_2B_3B_4B_5 ) must also be of the same color. 7. **Final Goal**: We now need to show that the edges of the pentagons ( A_i ) and ( B_i ) are the same color. Assume for contradiction that ( A_i ) are green and ( B_i ) are red. 8. **Considering ( A_iB_j )** Edges: - By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least three of the five edges ( A_1B_i ) must be the same color. Assume ( A_1B_i ), ( A_1B_j ), and ( A_1B_k ) are red. Since adjacent ( B )'s (( B_i ) and ( B_j )) would form an all-red triangle with ( A_1 ), this is not possible. - Repeating for ( A_2B_i ), three must be green. Due to overlaps, there exists a common ( B_i ) in the considered sets of green edges from different ( A )'s. 9. **Inconsistency**: This common ( B_i ) forming a triangle with ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ) results in a green triangle ( A_1A_2B_i ), which finally leads to an all-green triangle, contradicting the given condition. # Conclusion: Thus, maintaining consistency throughout the triangles and the partitioning within the pentagons forces the conclusion that all edges of the pentagon faces ( A_1A_2A_3A_4A_5 ) and ( B_1B_2B_3B_4B_5 ) must be the same color.

Given that each patch is 4 square feet, the total number of patches needed is: [ frac{320}{4} = 80 text{ patches} ] 3.

Since they all are distinct, the number of ways to arrange the music books is given by the factorial permutation: [ textrm{Number of ways} = 3! = 6 ] 2. **Arrangement of Mathematics and English Books:** Now, we have three slots created by the arrangement of music books. Let's denote the music books as (M_1, M_2, M_3). [ _ , M_1 , _ , M_2 , _ , M_3 , _ ] There are four slots ((_)) where we can place the mathematics book and the English books. - **Case 1:** The mathematics book is placed in one of the two end slots.

When they work together, their combined work rate per day is the sum of their individual work rates: Combined work rate = a's work rate + b's work rate + c's work rate = (1/18) + (1/6) + (1/12) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 18, 6, and 12 is 36. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 36: (1/18) = (2/36) (1/6) = (6/36) (1/12) = (3/36) Now we can add them: Combined work rate = (2/36) + (6/36) + (3/36) = (2 + 6 + 3) / 36 = 11/36 This means that together, they can complete 11/36 of the work in one day. To find out how many days they will take to complete the entire work, we divide the total work (1 unit) by their combined work rate: Days to complete work = Total work / Combined work rate = 1 / (11/36) = 36/11 ≈ 3.27 days So, working together, a, b, and c will take approximately boxed{3.27} days to complete the work."},{"prompt":"The area of the maximum size of the circle described from a 10inch square is what?","completion":"To find the area of the maximum size of the circle that can be described from a 10-inch square, we need to determine the diameter of the circle.

Let the vertices of the graph correspond to cities, and the edges correspond to roads connecting these cities. Initially, we have a graph ( G ) with 2002 vertices (cities) and edges (roads) in such a manner that removing any single vertex (city) does not disconnect the graph. 1. **Initial Assumptions and Definitions**: - The initial graph ( G ) is connected. - For any vertex ( v ) in ( G ), removing ( v ) and its incident edges results in a connected graph. - Each year, a non-intersecting cycle (loop with no repeated vertices other than the starting and ending vertex) is identified and removed. Each vertex in this cycle is connected to a newly added vertex, and all the roads forming the cycle are closed. 2. **Transformation Explanation**: - Consider a transformation where a cycle ( C ) is identified in ( G ). - Each vertex in cycle ( C ) is connected to a new vertex ( w ). This new vertex ( w ) becomes part of the graph after the roads in cycle ( C ) are removed. - This transformation is performed multiple times until no non-intersecting cycles remain in the graph. 3. **Final Graph Analysis**: - After several cycles of this transformation, a new graph ( G' ) is produced where all vertices from the original 2002-vertex graph will form stars with a central vertex ( w ) (from the addition process). - A vertex of a star has a degree of exactly 1 (connected only to the central vertex). 4. **Preserving Connectedness**: - Let's verify that connectedness is preserved post transformation. Given a graph ( G ) with vertex ( u ) such that removing ( u ) retains the graph's connectivity, consider any path in ( G ) not passing through ( u ). In ( G' ), although some edges involved in this path might be removed, their endpoints become connected to a new vertex. Thus, any path involving removed edges can be compensated by traversing through the new vertex ( w ). 5. **Conclusion**: - After each cycle, the structure evolves, but the essential property that graph remains connected (even if a vertex is removed) holds due to the explained process. - Each vertex from the initial graph ( G ) effectively forms a new connection as described, ensuring they end up with a degree of 1.

Let us denote two consecutive numbers by (a) and (b). 2. According to the problem, each number (x_i) in the circle is equal to the product of its neighboring numbers (x_{i-1}) and (x_{i+1}). Set (x_1 = a) and (x_2 = b), then (x_3 = frac{b}{a}), (x_4 = frac{1}{a}), (x_5 = frac{1}{b}), (x_6 = frac{a}{b}), and finally (x_7 = a).

Therefore, repeating the pattern generates a total six distinct numbers. This implies there cannot be more than 6 distinct numbers satisfying the given condition. 4. Let's explore smaller possible arrangements: - For 3 numbers: - If three numbers can be arranged, we would have (x = frac{1}{x}), implying (x = 1) or (x = -1). - If (x = 1), the sequence would be (a, 1, frac{a}{1} = a) which repeats. - If (x = -1), the sequence would be (-1, b, -b) with only the product constraint fitting if (-1 = b(-b)) which implies (b = 1). - Both these cases don't provide a new set of distinct numbers apart from considerations already addressed. - For 4 numbers: - If four numbers can be arranged, starting values would adjust to (a = frac{1}{b}), (b = frac{1}{c}) and (c = frac{1}{d}). Resolving this leads to repeated numbers without generating a continuous non-repeating distinct set larger than 6. - For 5 numbers: - If five numbers can be arranged, (a = frac{a}{b}) implies (b = 1). This would inherently loop back creating characteristics of smaller cycles assessed previously, relinquishing new distinct compounds. 5.

From the equation ( 3a = b^3 ), we can see that ( a = frac{b^3}{3} ). For ( a ) to be an integer, ( b^3 ) must be divisible by ( 3 ). Since ( b ) is a positive integer, ( b ) itself must be divisible by ( 3 ). Let ( b = 3k ) for some integer ( k ).

From the previous part, we have: [ a = 9k^3 quad text{and} quad a = 5m^2 ] Since ( a ) must satisfy both conditions simultaneously, we equate the two expressions: [ 9k^3 = 5m^2 ] This implies that ( a ) must be a common multiple of ( 9 ) and ( 5 ). The least common multiple of ( 9 ) and ( 5 ) is ( 45 ). Therefore, ( a ) must be of the form: [ a = 45n ] for some integer ( n ). 2. Since ( a ) is of the form ( 45n ), the prime factors of ( a ) are ( 3 ) and ( 5 ). # Part 3: Find ( a ). 1.

We rewrite it as: [ 9k^3 = 5m^2 ] This implies that ( k ) and ( m ) must be chosen such that both sides are equal. Since ( 9k^3 ) and ( 5m^2 ) must be equal, we need to find the smallest ( k ) and ( m ) that satisfy this condition. 2. By trial and error or by solving the equation, we find that the smallest values that satisfy this condition are ( k = 5 ) and ( m = 3 ).

We will analyze the prime factors involved, particularly the power of 2. 1. **Analyzing Powers of 2:** Suppose that S_{m+1} is divisible by 2^s but not by 2^{s+1}. This means the highest power of 2 dividing S_{m+1} is 2^s, implying s geq 2 because 4 is a factor of S_{m+1} (since 4S_{m} implies 2^2S_{m}). 2. **Inclusion of Divisors:** There must be a number among 1, 2, ldots, m+1 that is divisible by 2^s. If a is such a number, then frac{a}{2} is a smaller number (not exceeding m) and it must be divisible by 2^{s-1}. This means that S_{m} should be divisible by 2^{s-1}. If S_{m} is divisible by 2^{s-1}, then S_{m+1} cannot be only 2S_{m}, rendering 4S_{m} impossible in terms of powers of 2. 3. **Contradiction in the Power of 2:** Suppose the power of 2 that divides S_{m} is 2^t. Then since 2S_{m} includes 2^{t+1}, we need 2^{t+2} to fit 4S_{m}.

This can be reasoned from the sum of exterior angles of a polygon: [ text{Sum of exterior angles} = 360^circ ] Since an exterior angle of an acute interior angle is obtuse and there can be at most three such obtuse exterior angles in the context of the sum equaling 360°, a convex polygon can have at most three acute interior angles. 3. **Relation to Group Boundaries and Consecutive Segments:** Therefore, the boundaries of the groups of equal sides correspond to the vertices with acute angles.

The rules state that the last five characters of the license plate must include exactly two English letters (excluding 'I' and 'O') and the last character must be a digit. Here's the detailed solution: 1. **Determine the number of valid English letters:** According to the rules, we cannot use the letters 'I' and 'O'. Thus, the number of valid English letters is: [ 26 - 2 = 24 ] We shall denote this set of valid letters as ( V ) where ( |V| = 24 ). 2. **Choose positions for the two letters:** The two letters must be positioned among the first four positions of the last five characters of the plate (since the last character must be a digit). The number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 4 for the letters is given by the combination formula ( binom{4}{2} ): [ binom{4}{2} = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = frac{4 times 3}{2 times 1} = 6 ] 3. **Determine the number of ways to fill the chosen letter positions:** Each chosen letter position can be filled by any of the 24 valid letters.

To find out how many fewer people could fit on the raft if everyone wore life jackets, we need to calculate the difference in capacity when everyone is wearing a life jacket compared to when no one is wearing one. Let's assume that each life jacket takes up the space of one person. If 8 life jackets take up the space of 4 people, then each life jacket takes up the space of 0.5 person (4 people / 8 life jackets = 0.5 person per life jacket). Since there is only enough room for 21 people without life jackets, we can calculate the number of life jackets that would take up the space of 21 people: 21 people * 0.5 person per life jacket = 10.5 life jackets This means that 10.5 life jackets would take up the space of 21 people. Since we can't have half a life jacket, we'll round down to 10 life jackets taking up the space of 20 people, leaving room for only 1 person without a life jacket.

The total marks obtained by all boys is the average marks of all boys multiplied by the total number of boys: Total marks of all boys = Average of all boys * Total number of boys Total marks of all boys = 37 * 120 Now, we can express the total marks as the sum of the total marks of passed boys and failed boys: Total marks of all boys = (Average of passed boys * Number of passed boys) + (Average of failed boys * Number of failed boys) Total marks of all boys = (39 * P) + (15 * F) We can substitute the total marks of all boys from the first equation into this equation: 37 * 120 = (39 * P) + (15 * F) (2) Now we have two equations with two unknowns (P and F).

Let's denote this student as ( C ). 4. **Checking Mutual Acquaintance:** - If ( C ) (from School 3) knows any student ( B ) from School 2 that ( A ) also knows: - Then, ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) all know each other. - Conclusion: We have found the required three students. 5. **Ensuring Acquaintance in Other Cases:** - Suppose ( C ) does not know any student that ( A ) knows in School 2. - Then, the number of students ( C ) knows in School 2 is at most ( n-k ). - Therefore, ( C ) knows ( n+1 - (n-k) = k+1 ) students in School 1. - Since ( C ) already knows at least one student from School 1 (i.e., ( A )), the number ( k+1 ) must exceed ( k ), which would contradict our initial assumption of the maximum value of ( k ). 6. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, ( C ) must know one of the same students ( A ) knows in School 2, making ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) mutually acquainted.

Consider a trihedral angle ( Sxyz ) with (angle xSz = alpha), (angle xSy = beta), and (angle ySz = gamma). Let ( A, B, C ) denote the dihedral angles at edges ( y, z, x ) respectively. 2. Take a point ( M ) on ( Sx ), project ( M ) onto the plane ( Syz ) and let ( N ) be the projection of ( M ). Let ( P ) and ( Q ) be the projections of ( M ) onto ( Sy ) and ( Sz ) respectively. 3. By the three perpendicular lines theorem, ( NP ) is perpendicular to ( Sy ) and ( NQ ) is perpendicular to ( Sz ). 4. We have: [ MN = MP sin angle ySz = MS sin gamma sin A ] [ MN = MQ sin angle xSy = MS sin beta sin C ] 5. Thus, we get: [ frac{sin beta}{sin B} = frac{sin gamma}{sin C} ] 6. Similarly, we can show: [ frac{sin alpha}{sin A} = frac{sin gamma}{sin C} ] 7. Therefore, we conclude: [ frac{sin alpha}{sin A} = frac{sin beta}{sin B} = frac{sin gamma}{sin C} ] # Part (b) We need to show that (alpha + beta = 180^circ) if and only if (angle A + angle B = 180^circ). 1. Assume (alpha + beta = 180^circ). Then (gamma = 0^circ). 2. From part (a), we have: [ frac{sin alpha}{sin A} = frac{sin beta}{sin B} ] 3. Since (alpha + beta = 180^circ), (sin alpha = sin (180^circ - beta) = sin beta). 4. Therefore, (sin A = sin B), which implies (A = 180^circ - B). 5. Conversely, assume (angle A + angle B = 180^circ). Then (sin A = sin B). 6. From part (a), we have: [ frac{sin alpha}{sin A} = frac{sin beta}{sin B} ] 7. Since (sin A = sin B), (sin alpha = sin beta), which implies (alpha = 180^circ - beta). 8. Therefore, (alpha + beta = 180^circ). # Part (c) Assume (alpha = beta = gamma = 90^circ). Let (O in Sz) be a fixed point such that (SO = a) and let (M, N) be variable points on (x, y) respectively. We need to prove that (angle SOM + angle SON + angle MON) is constant and find the locus of the incenter of (OSMN). 1. Since (alpha = beta = gamma = 90^circ), the trihedral angle is a right trihedral angle. 2. The angles (angle SOM), (angle SON), and (angle MON) are all right angles. 3. Therefore, (angle SOM + angle SON + angle MON = 90^circ + 90^circ + 90^circ = 270^circ). 4. The incenter of (OSMN) is the point equidistant from all sides of the triangle. Since (O) is fixed and (M, N) are variable points on (x, y) respectively, the incenter will lie on the angle bisector of (angle SOM) and (angle SON). 5. The locus of the incenter is a circle centered at (O) with radius (a).

The chair is 53 cm 7 mm tall. To find Dong-min's height, we need to subtract the height of the chair from the total height measured when he is standing on the chair. Since we are working with centimeters and millimeters, we need to convert the measurements to the same unit. There are 10 millimeters in a centimeter, so 53 cm 7 mm is the same as 530 mm + 7 mm = 537 mm. Now, let's convert Dong-min's height when standing on the chair to millimeters as well: 190 cm = 1900 mm Now we subtract the height of the chair in millimeters from Dong-min's total height in millimeters when standing on the chair: 1900 mm - 537 mm = 1363 mm So, Dong-min's height is 1363 mm.

Show that there are infinitely many positive integers ( n ) so that ( gcd(x_n, n+2019) = 1 ).","completion":"Let's analyze the problem in a structured and detailed manner. We start with a polynomial ( P ) with integer coefficients such that ( P(0)=1 ). Define the sequence ( {x_i} ) by ( x_0=0 ) and ( x_{i+1} = P(x_i) ) for all ( i geq 0 ). We need to show that there are infinitely many positive integers ( n ) for which ( gcd(x_n, n+2019) = 1 ). **First Solution by Mod-Preservation:** 1. **Main Claim:** If there exists an index ( i ) such that ( left|x_{i+1} - x_iright| > 1 ), then we are done. 2. **Proof of the Main Claim:** - Let ( p ) be a prime that divides the difference ( x_{i+1} - x_i ). - Define ( t = x_i ), hence ( P(t) equiv t pmod{p} ). - Since ( P(0) = 1 ), ( t notequiv 0 pmod{p} ). - Consequently, we get: [ 0 notequiv x_i equiv x_{i+1} equiv x_{i+2} equiv ldots pmod{p} ] This implies ( x_n ) will never be congruent to 0 modulo ( p ) for ( n ) large enough. 3. **Construction of ( n ) using ( p ):** - Since ( p mid (x_{i+1} - x_i) ), we can choose ( n = p^e - 2019 ) for any ( e ) large enough. This will ensure ( gcd(x_n, n + 2019) = 1 ). 4. **The Remaining Cases:** - Suppose ( x_{i+1} in {x_i - 1, x_i, x_i + 1 } ) for all ( i geq 0 ). - **Case 1:** The sequence ( { x_n } ) is periodic with period at most 2. - This makes the problem easier since periodic sequences can be easily manipulated to create required ( n ). - **Case 2:** We have ( P(x) equiv x pm 1 ). - This scenario simplifies the analysis since small modifications to ( x ) are more manageable. **Second Solution by Orbits:** 1. **Prime ( p > 2019 ):** - Let ( p ) be any prime larger than 2019. - We aim to show that ( n = p ) will work as a solution. 2. **Periodicity Argument:** - We claim ( x_p notequiv 0 pmod{q} ) for any ( q ) dividing ( p + 2019 ). - Suppose for contradiction that ( x_p equiv 0 pmod{q} ). This implies the sequence ( (x_n mod q) ) is periodic with a period dividing ( p ). 3. **Contradiction Setup:** - However, since ( q mid (p + 2019) ) and ( q < p ), the period must also divide ( q ) but must not be 1 because ( P(0) = 1 ). - This sets up a contradiction since ( q < p ).

Since (w) is a positive integer, (10^w) is a 1 followed by (w) zeros in decimal notation. When we subtract 74 from this number, we are essentially subtracting 7 from the second-to-last digit (which is a 0) and 4 from the last digit (which is also a 0). For the subtraction to be possible without borrowing from the next digit to the left, the second-to-last digit must be at least 7. Since the second-to-last digit is originally 0, we need to have at least one more digit to the left of it to borrow from. This means that (w) must be at least 3 for the subtraction to be possible without resulting in a negative digit. If (w = 3), then (10^w = 1000), and (1000 - 74 = 926). The sum of the digits of 926 is (9 + 2 + 6 = 17). If (w) were greater than 3, then the subtraction would result in a number with a leading 9, followed by (w-3) nines (since we would have to borrow from each of the following zeros), a 2, and a 6.

First, let's express the square of the magnitude of overrightarrow{a}-2overrightarrow{b} in terms of the given information: [ |overrightarrow{a}-2overrightarrow{b}|^2 = (overrightarrow{a}-2overrightarrow{b}) cdot (overrightarrow{a}-2overrightarrow{b}) ] Expanding this, we get: [ |overrightarrow{a}-2overrightarrow{b}|^2 = overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{a} - 4overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} + 4overrightarrow{b} cdot overrightarrow{b} ] Given |overrightarrow{a}|=1, we know overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{a} = 1^2 = 1. The dot product 〈overrightarrow{a},overrightarrow{b}〉=frac{π}{6} represents the cosine of the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} multiplied by the magnitudes of overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}. However, this seems to be a mistake in the standard solution as the dot product should be a scalar value representing the magnitude of projection, not an angle. Assuming the intended meaning was that the dot product equals the magnitude of overrightarrow{b} times the cosine of the angle between them, and considering the given magnitude of overrightarrow{a}, we correct the interpretation to: [ overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = |overrightarrow{a}| |overrightarrow{b}| cos(theta) ] If theta = frac{pi}{6}, then cos(theta) = sqrt{3}/2, but since the dot product is given directly as frac{pi}{6}, which seems incorrect, we'll proceed under the assumption that there's a confusion in the problem statement. Let's correct the approach by considering the dot product as a given scalar value c, where we would normally have: [ -4overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = -4c ] And |overrightarrow{b}|^2 = |overrightarrow{b}|^2. Given |overrightarrow{a}-2overrightarrow{b}|=1, we substitute back: [ 1 = 1 - 4c + 4|overrightarrow{b}|^2 ] Solving for |overrightarrow{b}| when c is correctly interpreted (assuming c represents the product of magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between vectors), we would adjust the equation accordingly. However, since the provided solution directly jumps to: [ 1 - 2sqrt{3}|overrightarrow{b}| + 4|overrightarrow{b}|^2 = 1 ] This implies an adjustment to the interpretation of the dot product, leading to: [ 0 = -2sqrt{3}|overrightarrow{b}| + 4|overrightarrow{b}|^2 ] Rearranging and solving for |overrightarrow{b}|, we find: [ |overrightarrow{b}| = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] Thus, the correct answer, adhering to the format and correcting for the apparent confusion in the dot product interpretation, is: [ boxed{text{A: } frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Jason has 1342 Pokemon cards.

This line passes through the origin (0,0). 2. The modified equation is y = -frac{3}{4}x - 4. Comparing this with the original equation, we see that the only change is the addition of -4 to the y-value. This does not affect the slope of the line, meaning the line still decreases by frac{3}{4} units for every unit increase in x. However, the entire line is shifted vertically. 3. The term -4 added to the equation indicates a vertical shift.

Consequently, the age of the other grandchild is ( 30 - x ) since their combined ages total to 30 years. 2. According to the problem, each grandchild receives 10 forints for each year of their age up to that year. Thus, the sum of the money received by one grandchild who is ( x ) years old is: [ 10 + 20 + 30 + ldots + 10x = 10(1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + x) ] The series ( 1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + x ) is an arithmetic series with the sum formula ( frac{x(x+1)}{2} ). 3. Therefore, the total amount received by the grandchild who is ( x ) years old is: [ 10 left( frac{x(x+1)}{2} right) = 5x(x+1) ] 4.

According to the problem, the combined total of the money received by both grandchildren equals 2410 forints: [ 5x(x+1) + 5(30-x)(31-x) = 2410 ] 6.

Specifically, we correspond each opening parenthesis with a 1 and each multiplication sign with a -1. For example, the shown arrangement of parentheses in the product (x_0 x_1 x_2 x_3) corresponds to the sequence ({1, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1}). 2. **Non-negativity Condition:** The condition for the non-negativity of partial sums is fulfilled because each multiplication sign corresponds to its own pair of parentheses that \\"include\\" the expressions it multiplies. 3. **Construct Parenthesis Arrangement from Sequence:** Conversely, for each sequence, we can construct a parenthesis arrangement. Initially, as indicated above, place the opening parentheses and multiplication signs in an empty string, then restore the closing parentheses as follows: Let the opening parenthesis in the sequence correspond to (a_k=1). Find the shortest partial sum (a_k + ldots + a_m = 0) (this, obviously, can be found). Then (a_m = -1), and we place the closing parenthesis after the multiplication sign corresponding to (a_m). Subsequently, it's easy to insert the phrases of unknowns (x_0, ldots, x_n) into the resultant string. # Conclusion: The number of such sequences is given by the (n)-th Catalan number, (C_n).

Thus, half of these, about 1002.5, are odd, and the same number are even — however, since we cannot have half terms in reality, there are actually 1003 odd terms (including the initial 1, total 1004 odd positions) and 1002 even terms. - Calculating the sums separately: - Sum of terms in odd positions = 1 + (-1)^3 + (-1)^5 + cdots + (-1)^{2005} = 1 + (-1)(1003) = 1 - 1003 = -1002 - Sum of terms in even positions = (-1)^2 + (-1)^4 + cdots + (-1)^{2006} = 1(1002) = 1002 - Combining these, we get -1002 + 1002 = 0. boxed{0} Conclusion: Despite the phase shift in the summation starting with an explicit 1, the problem leverages the properties of even and odd exponents such that the positive and negative contributions still perfectly cancel each other out, giving a sum of zero."},{"prompt":"For |m1|, which of the following conclusions is correct?

Thus, we have: [|m-1| = -m + 1] Comparing |m-1| with |m|-1, we know that |m| = -m because m is less than 0, so: [|m-1| = -m + 1 > -m - 1 = |m| - 1] **Case 2:** When m geqslant 1 In this scenario, |m-1| simplifies to m-1 because m-1 is non-negative, and the absolute value of a non-negative number is the number itself.

The product of two of these roots is 13+i and the sum of the other two roots is 3+4i, where i^2 = 1. Find b.","completion":"Given the polynomial equation x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0 with real coefficients a, b, c, and d, and knowing it has four non-real roots, we can infer that these roots must form two pairs of complex conjugates due to the real nature of the coefficients. Let's denote two of these roots by z and w, which multiply to give 13+i. Since the product 13+i is not real, it implies that z and w are not conjugates of each other (because the product of a complex number and its conjugate is always real). Therefore, the other two roots must be the conjugates of z and w, denoted as overline{z} and overline{w}, respectively. This gives us the equations: [zw = 13+i] [overline{z} + overline{w} = 3+4i] To find the value of b, we use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For the coefficient b, it is equal to the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time. Thus, we have: [b = zw + zoverline{z} + zoverline{w} + woverline{z} + woverline{w} + overline{z} cdot overline{w}] Given zw = 13+i, we also know that the product of the conjugates overline{z} cdot overline{w} = overline{13+i} = 13-i. Substituting these values into the expression for b, we get: [b = 13+i + 13-i + (zoverline{z} + zoverline{w} + woverline{z} + woverline{w})] [b = 26 + (zoverline{z} + zoverline{w} + woverline{z} + woverline{w})] Observing the remaining terms, we can group them to factor out (z+w) and (overline{z}+overline{w}): [b = 26 + (z+w)(overline{z}+overline{w})] Given overline{z} + overline{w} = 3+4i, it follows that z + w = 3-4i (since the sum of a complex number and its conjugate is twice the real part of the complex number). Substituting these values into the expression for b, we find: [b = 26 + (3-4i)(3+4i)] [b = 26 + (3^2 - (4i)^2)] [b = 26 + (9 + 16)] [b = 26 + 25] [b = boxed{51}] This step-by-step approach closely follows the original solution, breaking down the process into more detailed steps and calculations."},{"prompt":"triangle ABC angle B = 60^o, O is the circumcenter, and L is the foot of an angle bisector of angle B .

The circumcircle of triangle BOL meets the circumcircle of ABC at point D ne B. We need to prove that BD perp AC. 2. **Redefine D**: Let D be the intersection of the B-altitude and the circumcircle odot(ABC). This means D lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC and BD is perpendicular to AC by definition of the altitude. 3. **Reflection and Orthocenter**: The reflection of D over BC is the orthocenter H of triangle ABC. It is well known that the orthocenter H and the circumcenter O are isogonal conjugates in triangle ABC. This implies that angle BAH = angle BAO and angle CAH = angle CAO. 4. **Isogonal Conjugates**: Since H and O are isogonal conjugates, angle DBL = angle OBL. This is because L is the foot of the angle bisector of angle B, and thus L lies on the angle bisector of angle B. 5. **Cyclic Quadrilateral**: Since angle DBL = angle OBL, quadrilateral BOLD is cyclic. This implies that D lies on the circumcircle of triangle BOL. 6. **Conclusion**: Since D lies on both the circumcircle of triangle ABC and the circumcircle of triangle BOL, and BD is the altitude from B to AC, it follows that BD perp AC.

To find the percentage decrease from 2008 to 2009, we calculate the ratio of the decrease to the 2008 price: frac{1.25x - 1.1x}{1.25x} = frac{0.15x}{1.25x} = 12% Therefore, the price in 2009 must be reduced by boxed{12%} compared to 2008."},{"prompt":"Let C be the circle with equation x^2 8y 7 = y^2 6x.

This circle has a radius r = sqrt{32} = 4sqrt{2} and center (a,b) = (-3,4).

The GCD of 105 and 189 is 21.

Do you have any sound I should learn?","completion":"Yes, as an English learner, there are several other sounds you should learn to pronounce correctly. Some of these include: 1. Vowels: English has many vowel sounds, including /æ/ (as in \\"cat\\"), /ɪ/ (as in \\"bit\\"), /ʌ/ (as in \\"but\\"), /eɪ/ (as in \\"say\\"), and /oʊ/ (as in \\"go\\"). 2. Consonants: Besides N, L, and R, there are many other consonant sounds, such as /p/ (as in \\"pat\\"), /b/ (as in \\"bat\\"), /t/ (as in \\"tin\\"), /k/ (as in \\"coin\\"), /g/ (as in \\"gone\\"), /s/ (as in \\"sign\\"), /z/ (as in \\"zone\\"), /ʧ/ (as in \\"chance\\"), and /ʤ/ (as in \\"jar\\"). 3. The /θ/ and /ð/ sounds: These sounds are represented by the \\"th\\" spelling in English. /θ/ is the voiceless sound in words like \\"thin\\" and \\"bath\\", while /ð/ is the voiced sound in words like \\"this\\" and \\"bathe\\". 4. The /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ sounds: These sounds are represented by the \\"sh\\" and \\"zh\\" spellings in English, respectively. /ʃ/ is found in words like \\"shop\\" and \\"cash\\", while /ʒ/ is found in words like \\"measure\\" and \\"beige\\". 5. The /w/ and /j/ sounds: These are the English \\"w\\" and \\"y\\" sounds, as in \\"west\\" and \\"yes\\" respectively. Practicing these sounds and understanding their correct pronunciation will significantly improve your English speaking skills. You may also wish to work with a language tutor or use audio resources to help you perfect your pronunciation."},{"prompt":"I see some symbol used to be explain how to pronounce when i learn english pronunciation.

IPA is an alphabetic system of phonetic notation based primarily on the Latin alphabet, with some additional characters. It was devised by the International Phonetic Association as a standardized representation of the sounds of spoken language. Here are some common IPA symbols for English sounds: Vowels: - /i:/ (as in \\"see\\") - /ɪ/ (as in \\"sit\\") - /e/ (as in \\"bet\\") - /æ/ (as in \\"cat\\") - /ə/ (as in \\"sofa\\") - /ʌ/ (as in \\"cup\\") - /ɒ/ (as in \\"pot\\") - /ɔ:/ (as in \\"law\\") - /u:/ (as in \\"too\\") - /ʊ/ (as in \\"put\\") - /aɪ/ (as in \\"my\\") - /aʊ/ (as in \\"how\\") - /eɪ/ (as in \\"say\\") - /oʊ/ (as in \\"go\\") - /ɪə/ (as in \\"here\\") - /ʊə/ (as in \\"tour\\") - /eə/ (as in \\"hair\\") Consonants: - /p/ (as in \\"pen\\") - /b/ (as in \\"bag\\") - /t/ (as in \\"tea\\") - /d/ (as in \\"dog\\") - /k/ (as in \\"cat\\") - /g/ (as in \\"go\\") - /m/ (as in \\"man\\") - /n/ (as in \\"not\\") - /ŋ/ (as in \\"sing\\") - /f/ (as in \\"fish\\") - /v/ (as in \\"very\\") - /ɵ/ (as in \\"thank\\") - /ð/ (as in \\"then\\") - /s/ (as in \\"sun\\") - /z/ (as in \\"zoo\\") - /ʃ/ (as in \\"she\\") - /ʒ/ (as in \\"measure\\") - /ʧ/ (as in \\"cheese\\") - /ʤ/ (as in \\"judge\\") - /r/ (as in \\"red\\") - /j/ (as in \\"yes\\") - /w/ (as in \\"wet\\") - /l/ (as in \\"leg\\") - /h/ (as in \\"hat\\") Understanding and learning IPA symbols can help you improve your pronunciation by providing you with a guide on how words should sound.

Here are the steps: 1. Select the original table that contains the data you want to filter and convert it into a PivotTable. 2. Place the column with the row values you want to use in the new table as the first row field in the PivotTable. 3. Place the column with the values you want to filter by as a column field in the PivotTable. 4. Select the cells in the PivotTable that represent the filtered values, copy them, and paste them into a new sheet. 5. In the new sheet, use the INDEX and MATCH functions to reference the values in the original PivotTable and return the desired filtered values as subcolumns. 6. Repeat steps 4-5 for each column you want to include as subcolumns in the new table. 7. Format the new table as desired. Here's an example formula that retrieves filtered values from the original PivotTable based on the row value and column heading: =IFERROR(INDEX(PivotTable[[Value]:[Value]], MATCH([@Row Value], PivotTable[[Row Value]:[Row Value]], 0), MATCH([Column Heading], PivotTable[[Column Heading]:[Column Heading]], 0)), \\"\\") In this formula, \\"PivotTable\\" is the name of the original PivotTable and \\"[@Row Value]\\" and \\"[Column Heading]\\" are references to the row and column headers in the new table, respectively.

This lion was not just any normal lion, he was the king of the jungle and he practiced martial arts. He loved to learn and read books about different fighting methods from around the world. One day, while the sun shined brightly and the sky was blue, the lion was practicing his kicks. He kicked fast and high to reach a red ball hanging by a tall tree. Many animals gathered around to watch him, such as a small elephant, a green bird, and a playful cat. There was a big river near his house, and fish lived happily in the cool water. On a distant island, a cow, a pig, and a goat competed to eat the tastiest vegetables and grass. A yellow dog brought new energy to the farm, and an ant quietly carried a piece of cake over a desk. In this magical land, a queen could dance in a chair, and a king could do a job writing letters with ink. An umbrella could drive a car, and a light made electric fans spin softly. Everything was full of life. One day, as the lion practiced his moves, a bear appeared from behind a tree. The bear was also a martial arts master. They decided to test their skills by having a friendly battle on the top of the mountain. The lion leaped on a white star while the bear jumped on the moon. They exchanged blows and kicks quickly, but also slowly and with control. All the while, a crowd had gathered at the base of the mountain. They laughed, clapped, and sang as they watched the two masters in action. The animals cheered on the lion, as did the plant life, their tall leaves bending in the wind. Even the inanimate objects in the land, like a table with a phone, joined in the excitement. In the end, the lion lost the fight. He was tired, but he didn't give up. He continued to practice every day and night, under the heat of the sun and the cold rains that blew through his mountain home. He knew that he would only become better if he kept practicing. Years went by, and the lion's power began to grow. He became so strong that the sky turned orange whenever he practiced his kicks. The mountains shook, trees were uprooted, and flowers bloomed as he trained. The king of the jungle was growing into a true master. One day, the lion challenged the bear to a rematch. They fought again, this time the lion was victorious. Despite the lion's previous loss, the animals and everyone else still admired him for his resilience and determination. Through his hard work and persistence, the lion proved to everyone that it does not matter how much we fail in our practices. People always admire and remember our last results, power, and success. No one would ever forget the king of the jungle who practiced martial arts on that faraway mountain."},{"prompt":"Hi, what would you recommend to implement at work place for work life balance?","completion":"As an AI language model, I do not have personal experience in the workplace. However, I can suggest some general recommendations for work-life balance: 1. Encourage flexible working hours and remote work options to enable employees to balance work and personal obligations. 2.

Create a culture that supports taking breaks, such as encouraging employees to take their lunch breaks away from their desks. 4. Encourage open and transparent communication about workload and deadlines to avoid employees feeling overwhelmed or overworked. 5. Promote a healthy work-life balance by limiting overtime and providing ample time off for holidays, vacation, and personal days. 6. Encourage employees to disconnect from work during non-work hours, such as not checking their emails after work hours. 7. Advocate for a reasonable workload and not set unreasonable expectations."},{"prompt":"What other wellness programs do you suggest?","completion":"There are many wellness programs that employers can offer their employees to support their physical and mental health.

Although these studies have provided valuable insights, it is essential to compare their results with other studies and consider the limitations in interpreting the findings. Farahbakhsh et al. (2023) conducted a prospective analysis of acute risk factors for pressure ulcers in individuals with traumatic spinal fractures with or without SCI. While their results are valuable, other studies conducted in different countries and populations could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the acute risk factors. Additionally, the study's generalizability may be limited due to its focus on Iranian patients and data from the National Spinal Column/Cord Injury Registry of Iran (NSCIR-IR). Several studies investigated sexual matters in individuals with SCI. For instance, Salmani et al. (2019) and Maasoumi et al. (2018) examined sexual matters of couples with SCI and the development of a sexual needs rehabilitation framework in Iranian women with SCI, respectively. These studies can be compared with similar research from other countries to determine whether the outcomes are consistent among diverse populations. Also, the cultural differences between countries must be considered when interpreting these findings, as beliefs and perceptions regarding sexuality may vary. Dezfoly et al. (2018) and Yazdanshenas Ghazwin et al. (2017) examined depression and psychological defense mechanisms in patients with SCI. When comparing these studies with other psychological research among individuals with SCI, it is essential to consider methodological differences, such as the assessment scales used, sample size, and study design. Furthermore, cultural factors may also influence the prevalence of psychological disorders and the use of defense mechanisms. Several studies investigated the association between socioeconomic status and SCI outcome. For example, Khazaeipour et al. (2017) explored the relationship between pain, social support, and socioeconomic indicators in patients with SCI. When comparing these findings with other studies, it is crucial to consider factors such as employment opportunities, social welfare policies, and availability of resources that may vary across nations. Moreover, some studies examined the health outcomes of patients with SCI, such as sleep quality (Matin et al., 2014), depression and fatigue (Matin et al., 2015), religious coping (Rahnama et al., 2015), and cardiometabolic risk factors (Sabour et al., 2013). It is essential to compare the trends observed in these studies with the findings from other countries to determine whether the results are consistent. Several limitations should be noted when interpreting the findings from these studies. Firstly, most studies have been conducted in Iran and may not represent the experiences of individuals with SCI in other countries. Additionally, cultural, socioeconomic, and psychological factors may influence the outcome variables, making direct comparisons challenging. Finally, variations in study design, population characteristics, and assessment tools may limit the generalizability and comparability of these findings. Conclusion In conclusion, the studies conducted in Iran provide valuable insights into various aspects of SCI, such as risk factors, sexuality, psychological well-being, and health outcomes. However, when interpreting these findings, it is essential to consider the limitations and contextual factors that may influence the generalizability and comparability of the results. Comparing these studies with research conducted in other countries and incorporating diverse perspectives will enable a comprehensive understanding of the challenges faced by individuals with SCI and facilitate the development of appropriate interventions and services."},{"prompt":"详细介绍一下BERT模型的框架与原理","completion":"BERT（Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers）是一种预训练的深度学习模型，主要用于自然语言处理（NLP）任务。该模型利用Transformer架构，对大量文本数据进行无监督训练，从而更好地理解文字间隐含的语义关系。BERT可以有效地提高多种NLP任务的准确性，如文本分类、命名实体识别、问答等。以下是BERT模型的框架与原理： 1. 框架： BERT的基础结构是多层的Transformer编码器架构。Transformer是一种自注意力机制，允许模型在不同的词语之间捕获重要的关系。具体而言，BERT使用自注意力头为文本序列中的每个单词生成一个向量表示，同时捕捉了整个句子的上下文信息。这些向量表示可以从底层到更高层进行组合，从而允许模型学习更加复杂的语义结构。 BERT模型有两种主要的预训练模型： - BERT-Base：包含12层（Encoder layers）、12个自注意力头（Attention heads）和768个隐藏层大小（Hidden size），总共有约 110M 个参数。 - BERT-Large：包含 24层（Encoder layers）、16个自注意力头（Attention heads）和1024个隐藏层大小（Hidden size），总共约340M个参数。 2. 原理： BERT的预训练主要分为两个阶段：预训练和微调。 2.1 预训练： 在预训练阶段，BERT的创新之举是利用大量无标注文本进行双向训练。在这个阶段，BERT引入了两个预训练任务：掩码语言建模（MLM） 和 下一句预测（NSP）。 - 掩码语言建模（MLM）：在训练过程中，输入句子中的一部分单词被随机替换为一个特殊的掩码符号（MASK）。模型的目标是根据句子其他部分的上下文信息，预测被掩码的单词。这种训练方式使模型能够学习双向的语义信息。 - 下一句预测（NSP）：这个任务旨在让模型学习理解句子之间的关系。给定一对句子，模型需要预测第二个句子是否紧跟在第一个句子之后。这个任务有助于BERT更好地应对需要理解多个句子关系的任务，如问答和自然语言推理等。 2.2 微调： 在预训练阶段完成后，BERT模型已经学会了丰富的语义表示。然后，在实际的NLP任务中，我们需要对预训练的BERT进行微调。微调阶段只需较少的标注数据就能使模型针对具体任务进行优化。 在微调过程中，通常在BERT模型的顶部添加一个任务相关的神经网络层，如全连接层、卷积层等。然后连同BERT整个模型进行端到端的微调训练。在训练时，利用带标签的数据计算损失，利用梯度下降进行参数更新。经过微调后，BERT能够根据特定任务生成更有针对性的结果。 综上所述，BERT通过预训练和微调两个阶段，利用双向Transformer-encoder结构对大量无标注文本进行学习，提升了NLP任务的准确性和效能。"},{"prompt":"Redaccion sobre el final del curso con 270 palabrasen valenciano","completion":"Alguns poden pensar que el final del curs és com un tancament, una fi abrupta dels esforços realitzats, però no ho veig així.

В тексте должно быть много умных слов и специальных терминов из психологии и философии. Объем не менее 1200 слов.","completion":"Черно-белая фотография белого пластикового стаканчика, лежащего вверх дном на полу, сопровождается тенью, падающей от него на пол. На первый взгляд, это простой элементарный объект, но его повседневность может стать причиной глубокой философской рефлексии. Рассмотрим этот стаканчик как объект, отражающий современное состояние человека. Как и стаканчик, человек состоит из материала: мышц, костей, клеток, нейронов и так далее. Но, так же как стаканчик, человек имеет тени. Тени, которые представляют собой нечто, что остается за кадром, не видимое глазами, но все равно влияющее на сознание человека. Умение постигать и понимать информацию, которую не способен воспринимать зрительно, является основой психологии. Ведь тень, падающая от стаканчика, также символизирует наши внутренние тени и трудности, с которыми мы сталкиваемся в жизни. Тень может символизировать темные красоты наших душевных уголков, которые мы не желаем показывать окружающим. Это может быть скрытые мысли и желания, интимные эмоции и тайны, которые мы стараемся скрыть от других. Стаканчик, лежащий вверх дном и создающий тень, можем достаточно легко ассоциироваться с состоянием беспомощности и невозможности, с которыми мы столкнулись в повседневной жизни. Это может быть болезнь, разрыв в отношениях, финансовые трудности и так далее. Однако, если мы рассмотрим эту фотографию не только как символ наших теней и трудностей, но и как аллегорию сознательного принятия своих теней, мы можем получить новый взгляд на этот объект. Психоанализ Юнга проповедует идею того, что сознание человека должно стремится к гармонии, здоровому балансу разного типа энергий. Мы должны смотреть на свои тени и принимать их, не отрицая нечто основное в своей жизни. Таким образом, черно-белая фотография, где белый пластиковый стаканчик лежит вверх дном на полу, может стать аллегорией того, что мы должны принимать себя в любом своём проявлении, как светлое, так и темное. Истинная гармония достигается только тогда, когда мы позволяем своим теням и силам быть под открытым наблюдением и контролем. Эта универсальная мудрость может применяться в различных сферах жизни - в творчестве, в отношениях, в работе. Человек не может изменять то, что не принял со своими тенями. Именно поэтому принятие и уважение к своим теням и способности к мудрой манипуляции энергиями, могут стать ключом к здоровой психологии и гармонии в нашей жизни."},{"prompt":"Напишите программу на python , которая запрашивала бы у пользователя: - ФИО ( \\"Ваши фамилия, имя, отчество?\\") - возраст (\\"Сколько Вам лет?\\") - место жительства (\\"Где вы живете?\\") После этого выводила бы три строки: \\"Ваше имя\\" \\"Ваш возраст\\" \\"Вы живете в\\"","completion":"name = input(\\"Ваши фамилия, имя, отчество? \\") age = input(\\"Сколько Вам лет? \\") place = input(\\"Где вы живете? \\") print(\\"Ваше имя:\\", name) print(\\"Ваш возраст:\\", age) print(\\"Вы живете в\\", place)"},{"prompt":"напиши код на python Дано вещественное число - цена 1 кг конфет (ваш номер по списку).

Flexibilité : Le mode Kanban est basé sur le principe de la flexibilité et de l'adaptabilité. Le travail est organisé en fonction des priorités et des demandes changeantes des clients et des parties prenantes. Cela permet à l'équipe d'être réactive et de s'adapter rapidement aux changements, ce qui est essentiel dans un environnement agile. 2. Optimisation du flux de travail : Le système Kanban vise à optimiser le flux de travail en s'assurant que les tâches sont complétées de manière efficace et cohérente. Cela permet à l'équipe d'exploitants informatiques de travailler sur les éléments les plus prioritaires et de réduire le temps de traitement des demandes. 3. Transparence et visibilité : Le tableau Kanban offre une transparence sur l'état des tâches et ses blocages éventuels, ce qui facilite la communication et la collaboration au sein de l'équipe. Cela est particulièrement utile dans un contexte agile SAFe qui encourage la collaboration entre différentes équipes pour favoriser l'alignement et la synchronisation des efforts. 4. Amélioration continue : Le mode Kanban encourage une amélioration continue en permettant à l'équipe d'identifier et de résoudre les problèmes de manière proactive. Cela soutient le concept d'agilité, où les équipes cherchent constamment des moyens d'améliorer leur travail et leurs processus. 5. Gestion des ressources : Dans un contexte agile SAFe, les équipes sont encouragées à travailler de manière autonome et à prendre en charge la gestion de leurs ressources. Le mode Kanban facilite cette gestion en fournissant une vue claire de la charge de travail de chaque membre de l'équipe, en veillant à ce que la capacité de l'équipe soit utilisée de manière optimale. 6. Réduction du gaspillage : Le système Kanban vise à minimiser les gaspillages, tels que les travaux en cours inutiles et les délais d'attente. Cela est conforme à la philosophie agile, qui préconise l'efficacité et l'élimination des activités qui n'apportent pas de valeur ajoutée. 7. Alignement avec les principes et les pratiques SAFe : Kanban est une approche éprouvée et compatible avec les principes et les pratiques du Scaled Agile Framework. L'intégration du mode Kanban dans un contexte SAFe facilite l'adoption des autres pratiques agiles, telles que la planification en juste-à-temps, l'anticipation des risques et l'apprentissage par erreur. En résumé, une équipe d'exploitants informatiques travaillant en mode Kanban est une bonne chose dans un contexte agile SAFe, car elle permet une meilleure flexibilité, optimisation du flux de travail, transparence, amélioration continue, gestion des ressources, réduction du gaspillage et alignement avec les principes et pratiques SAFe."},{"prompt":"Напиши на python решение: в массиве целых чисел все отрицательные элементы заменить на положительные и вывести полученные массивы","completion":"Можно решить данную задачу используя простой цикл, в котором производится проверка каждого элемента массива на отрицательность. Если элемент отрицательный, то он заменяется на абсолютное значение этого элемента: \`\`\`python numbers = [-5, 2, 0, -9, 10, -3, -8, 4] for i in range(len(numbers)): if numbers[i] < 0: numbers[i] = abs(numbers[i]) print(numbers) \`\`\` Вывод: \`\`\` [5, 2, 0, 9, 10, 3, 8, 4] \`\`\` Таким образом, все отрицательные элементы заменены на положительные. В данном случае использовалась функция \`abs\`, которая возвращает абсолютное значение числа."},{"prompt":"Напиши на python : дана строка, содержащая текст, найти количество символов","completion":"Для нахождения количества символов в строке можно использовать функцию \`len\`. Просто передаем в эту функцию строку и она вернет количество символов (включая пробелы и знаки препинания), как в примере ниже: \`\`\`python text = \\"Эта строка содержит текст\\" count = len(text) print(\\"Количество символов в строке:\\", count) \`\`\` Вывод: \`\`\` Количество символов в строке: 25 \`\`\` Таким образом, мы нашли количество символов в заданной строке."},{"prompt":"Реши на python: в строке заменить все двоеточия знаком процента, подсчитать знак процента в строке","completion":"Чтобы заменить все двоеточия в строке на знак процента, можно воспользоваться методом \`replace\`, передав строку, которую нужно заменить (в нашем случае двоеточие \`:\`) и строку, на которую нужно заменить (здесь - знак процента \`%\`). Пример: \`\`\`python text = \\"Это: строка: с двоеточиями: для: замены\\" text_with_percents = text.replace(\\":\\", \\"%\\") print(text_with_percents) \`\`\` Вывод: \`\`\` Это% строка% с двоеточиями% для% замены \`\`\` Теперь, чтобы подсчитать количество знаков процента в полученной строке, можно пройти по каждому символу и проверять, является ли он знаком процента. Для решения этой задачи можно использоваться цикл \`for\` и оператор условия \`if\`. Пример: \`\`\`python count = 0 for char in text_with_percents: if char == \\"%\\": count += 1 print(\\"Количество знаков процента:\\", count) \`\`\` Вывод: \`\`\` Количество знаков процента: 4 \`\`\` Таким образом, мы заменили все двоеточия в строке на знак процента и подсчитали количество знаков процента в полученной строке."},{"prompt":"中南大学logo png格式图","completion":"很抱歉，作为一个AI语言模型，我不能直接提供图片文件。但是你可以在互联网上查找相关图片并下载。这是中南大学官方网站的链接：http://www.csu.edu.cn/ ，你可以在这里找到他们的徽标。"},{"prompt":"eu tenho 100 seguidores no meu instagram de textos filosóficos de minha autoria, porém o meu instagram entrega os meus reels somente para 20 seguidores que eu tenho, por que isso?","completion":"Como um assistente de IA, não posso dizer com certeza por que isso está acontecendo. No entanto, existem algumas razões possíveis: 1. O algoritmo do Instagram pode não estar exibindo seus reels para todos os seus seguidores devido a uma diminuição no engajamento em seus posts anteriores. 2. Seus seguidores podem ter seus feed saturados ou não estão navegando no Instagram com frequência suficiente para visualizar os seus reels. 3. Seus seguidores podem não estar interessados no conteúdo que você está publicando no momento, o que pode afetar o alcance dos seus reels. 4. O Instagram pode estar testando diferentes variações de seu algoritmo e mudando sistemas de entrega para um público mais segmentado. Recomendamos que você continue produzindo conteúdo de qualidade e interagindo com seus seguidores para fortalecer seu engajamento e alcance. Além disso, considere usar palavras-chave e hashtags relevantes em suas publicações para ajudar o Instagram a encontrar o público certo para seu conteúdo."},{"prompt":"como encontrar o público perfeito para meus textos de filosofia que publico na minha pagina do instagram?","completion":"Existem algumas estratégias que você pode utilizar para encontrar seu público ideal para seus textos de filosofia no Instagram: 1. Identifique outras contas relacionadas à filosofia e siga seus seguidores. Pode ser bibliotecas, instituições, filósofos, influenciadores, entre outros. Eles provavelmente possuem seguidores que podem se interessar pelo seu conteúdo e seguir sua página. 2. Faça pesquisa de hashtags relevantes. Use hashtags que sejam pertinentes ao seu conteúdo e que os usuários do Instagram possam estar procurando. Exemplo de hashtags: #filosofia #pensamentos #reflexões. 3. Colabore com outros criadores de conteúdo na plataforma. Tente encontrar outros influenciadores ou criadores de conteúdo que produzem conteúdo semelhante ao seu e sugira uma colaboração para compartilhar seus seguidores. 4. Promova sua página fora do Instagram. Se você tem um blog ou site, por exemplo, compartilhe seus links e convide as pessoas a seguir sua página no Instagram. Além disso, é possível divulgar a sua página por meio de outros canais da sua marca, como Facebook, Twitter ou outros. 5. Mensure o sucesso da sua estratégia. Acompanhe as métricas de sua página, como engajamento e alcance, e faça ajustes ao longo do tempo para encontrar a melhor maneira de se conectar com o público certo para o seu tipo de conteúdo."},{"prompt":"reels é o que mais traz alcance para o instagram, devo focar em postar somente reels ou devo fazer posts normais também? tenho uma página de textos filosóficos no instagram","completion":"Embora os reels estejam gerando um grande alcance atualmente no Instagram, é importante diversificar seus tipos de conteúdo em sua página. Embora os reels possam gerar alcance imediato, pode ser mais difícil manter o interesse do público a longo prazo se você não oferecer variedade em suas postagens. Os posts normais também são importantes para estabelecer autoridade em seu nicho e para que seus seguidores conheçam melhor o seu trabalho e sua personalidade. Dito isso, é claro que pode ser uma boa estratégia incluir alguns reels em seu mix de conteúdo, especialmente se você está a procura de um alcance maior e de novos seguidores em sua página de textos filosóficos no Instagram. Os reels que forem criativos, informativos e envolventes têm mais chances de serem compartilhados e alcançarem um público maior. Portanto, a melhor estratégia é encontrar um equilíbrio saudável entre posts normais e reels em sua página do Instagram. Concentre-se em produzir conteúdo relevante e de qualidade, e alterne entre tipos diferentes de postagens para manter o interesse de seus seguidores."},{"prompt":"quantos posts de cada devo fazer por dia?","completion":"Não há uma resposta definitiva para esta pergunta, já que a quantidade de posts que é ideal para o seu Instagram dependerá da sua estratégia de conteúdo, recursos disponíveis e do seu público-alvo. No entanto, para a maioria das marcas e criadores de conteúdo no Instagram, postar uma ou duas vezes por dia pode ser suficiente para manter a sua página ativa e engajada sem sobrecarregar seus seguidores. O importante é manter a consistência, para que seus seguidores fiquem engajados e retornem regularmente em busca de novidades. Além disso, é importante prestar atenção na qualidade do conteúdo que você está compartilhando em suas postagens e garantir que cada post entregue valor para seus seguidores. As postagens que têm qualidade, engajamento e possuem um impacto positivo em sua audiência podem ser mais eficazes do que várias postagens que não agregam valor substancial. Por fim, lembre-se de monitorar suas métricas, como engajamento, alcance e seguidores, para avaliar como o seu público está respondendo ao seu conteúdo e fazer ajustes em sua estratégia conforme necessário."},{"prompt":"eu tenho um plano de postar 6 textos por dia 3 em formato de reels e 3 em posts normais, cada texto com um conteúdo de filosofia diferente, o que acha?","completion":"Postar 6 textos por dia é uma quantidade significativa de conteúdo para a maioria das marcas e criadores de conteúdo no Instagram. No entanto, se você puder produzir e manter esse ritmo de postagens, essa estratégia pode ser eficaz para fornecer aos seus seguidores conteúdo útil, diverso e envolvente. Lembre-se de que a qualidade do conteúdo é fundamental, portanto, se você optar por postar seis textos por dia, certifique-se de que eles são bem pensados, criativos e relevantes para a sua audiência. Além disso, é importante personalizar seu conteúdo para o formato de postagem escolhido - inclua legendas relevantes, imagens ou vídeos que complementem o conteúdo e use hashtags estrategicamente. Ao combinar posts normais e reels, você estará oferecendo variedade a seus seguidores, o que pode aumentar ainda mais o seu número de engajamentos. Certifique-se de que as postagens sejam voltadas para públicos diferentes, diversificando os temas e a linguagem utilizada, e preste atenção às suas métricas para avaliar como o seu público está respondendo a cada um desses formatos. Por fim, vale a pena lembrar que o conteúdo mais importante que você deve compartilhar em seus posts do Instagram é representar a você mesmo. Não sacrifique a sua personalidade e seus valores pessoais para agradar sua audiência. Seus seguidores seguirão você e se envolverão com seu conteúdo, se forem autênticos e verdadeiros."},{"prompt":"qual é o tema de filosofia mais falado nas paginas de filosofia do instagram?","completion":"Não há um tema de filosofia específico que seja o mais falado nas páginas de filosofia do Instagram, pois tudo depende do perfil de cada página e da variedade de interesses dos seguidores. Algumas contas de filosofia podem ter como foco um determinado filósofo ou escola de pensamento em particular, enquanto outras podem se concentrar em tópicos atuais e contemporâneos, e outras podem se especializar em abordar questões éticas. Alguns tópicos que são frequentemente discutidos em contas de filosofia do Instagram incluem: - Epistemologia: a filosofia do conhecimento e da crença - Ética: a filosofia da moralidade e dos valores - Metafísica: a filosofia da realidade e da existência - Filosofia política: a filosofia do estado, do poder e da governança - Filosofia da mente: a filosofia da consciência, do pensamento e da razão - Filosofia da ciência: a filosofia da investigação científica e da teoria do conhecimento científico. No entanto, como mencionado anteriormente, cada página de filosofia no Instagram pode ter seu próprio enfoque e abordagem, portanto, pode ser interessante explorar diferentes contas para descobrir o que elas têm a oferecer em termos de conteúdo e temas."},{"prompt":"quais são os melhores tópicos para eu fixar stories na minha página de textos filosóficos de minha autoria no instagram?","completion":"Fixar stories é uma ótima maneira de destacar e manter o conteúdo essencial em sua página de textos filosóficos no Instagram. Aqui estão alguns dos melhores tópicos que você pode considerar fixar em seus stories: 1. Introdução: ofereça aos seus novos seguidores uma breve introdução de quem você é e o que faz em sua página. 2. Sobre mim: compartilhe informações pessoais (dentro do limite que você se sentir confortável) para acrescentar mais personalidade à sua página e conectá-la com seus seguidores 3. Textos populares: destaque alguns dos textos mais populares que você já publicou. Assim, os novos seguidores podem se sentir atraídos e as pessoas que já te acompanham podem relembrar dos seus textos favoritos. 4. Lançamentos de novos textos: destaque quando você publicar novos textos e inclua um link para o conteúdo. 5. Curiosidades filosóficas: compartilhe fatos interessantes sobre filosofia ou pensadores, dessa forma, seu público pode aprender um pouco no processo de acompanhar sua página. 6. Mensagens motivacionais: algumas vezes pode ser útil compartilhar trechos de textos que vão motivar os seguidores. 7.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"can you write a quick content about car within 2000 words?","completion":"Sure! Here is a quick content about cars: Cars are one of the most common forms of transportation used throughout the world. They are designed with a variety of features and functions to cater to different needs and preferences. Cars have come a long way from their inception, and they continue to evolve with modern technology and innovations. The first car, known as the Benz Patent Motorwagen, was invented in 1886 by Karl Benz. It had a three-wheeled design and was powered by a petrol engine. Cars quickly gained popularity due to their convenience and flexibility. They could travel long distances quickly, easily navigate through traffic, and transport people and goods efficiently. Over time, car manufacturers have introduced various types of cars, including sedans, coupes, convertibles, SUVs, and many more. Each type serves a different purpose, from providing a luxurious driving experience to accommodating larger families or carrying heavy loads. One of the most important features of a car is its engine. Most cars have internal combustion engines that run on petrol or diesel. However, in recent years, electric cars have become increasingly popular. They use electric motors and batteries to power the car, producing zero emissions and offering a more eco-friendly option. Another essential part of a car is its transmission. Most cars have either an automatic or manual gearbox. The automatic gearbox shifts gears automatically, whereas the manual gearbox requires the driver to shift gears manually. Recent advancements in technology have allowed manufacturers to introduce dual-clutch gearboxes and continuously variable transmissions that optimize fuel efficiency and performance. Safety is a crucial aspect of cars. To ensure the safety of drivers and passengers, car manufacturers have designed various safety features, including airbags, collision detection, lane departure warnings, and blind spot monitoring. These features have significantly reduced the number of fatalities and injuries related to car accidents. In conclusion, cars have come a long way since their inception. They are a convenient and efficient mode of transportation and have evolved to cater to different needs and preferences. With modern technology and innovations, cars continue to evolve and provide safer, more eco-friendly, and luxurious options for drivers and passengers."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

No regrets, only memories, Reminders of a time When dreams and aspirations soared And life, like flowing rhyme, Pulsed in rhythms so divine, Each moment unaware That youth would fade and disappear Like mist upon the air. No regrets, only memories within A heart that seeks in vain, To mock the hourglass of life and chide The hands of fate's cruel game; But long roads twist, a dance of chance, With colors changing hue, In mellowed thought, like autumn's leaves, I wear life's richest jewels. No regrets, only memories of loss And triumphs still, intermingled In the web of lessons past, In ever-spinning reels. Nostalgia's veil may softly cast, An echo of the spell, To wander through the sacred vaults Where recollections dwell. No regrets, only memories, Of laughter and of tears, The chronicles of love and loss, As time holds dear, sincere. For each success, and the pain that rests, In the embrace of days gone by, The waltz of life, the strife of dreams, In the echoes of a sigh. In the fabric of the ageless skies, As eons slowly wane, A gilded tale unfolds upon The cosmic script of fate. No regrets, only memories, A carousel of light, Which arcs across eternity, To bask in love's delight. No regrets, only memories Are etched upon the stars, And in their quiet, glistening dance, They sooth our deepest scars. As hearts take wing, our dreams ascend, We merge into the sun And burn away our earthly woes That once tied and held us, worn. No regrets, only memories, In the tapestry of time, Unraveling sweet melodies, Each verse, a life in rhyme."},{"prompt":"你是谁","completion":"我是一个人工智能助手，我的名字是OpenAI。我的目标是为您提供帮助，回答问题和解决问题。"},{"prompt":"帮我使用UniAPP，写一个列表。","completion":"好的，下面是一个使用UniAPP的列表示例： 1. 首先，我们需要在pages文件夹下创建一个新的页面，命名为list.vue。 2. 在list.vue中，我们需要使用uni-list组件来创建一个列表。可以先在template标签中添加如下代码： \`\`\` <template> <view> <uni-list> <uni-list-item title=\\"Item 1\\"></uni-list-item> <uni-list-item title=\\"Item 2\\"></uni-list-item> <uni-list-item title=\\"Item 3\\"></uni-list-item> </uni-list> </view> </template> \`\`\` 3. 上面的代码中，我们创建了一个包含3个列表项的简单列表。现在我们可以运行这个页面，看看效果： ![list-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1598108/81526003-fbdd6a00-9399-11ea-89e4-9be6c6de647d.png) 4. 当然，我们可能需要为每个列表项添加一些详细信息或者操作项。比如在第一个列表项中添加一段简短的描述，可以在uni-list-item组件内加入uni-media-box组件： \`\`\` <template> <view> <uni-list> <uni-list-item title=\\"Item 1\\"> <uni-media-box> <view slot=\\"content\\">Description for item 1</view> </uni-media-box> </uni-list-item> <uni-list-item title=\\"Item 2\\"></uni-list-item> <uni-list-item title=\\"Item 3\\"></uni-list-item> </uni-list> </view> </template> \`\`\` 5. 现在我们再次运行页面，效果如下： ![list-example-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1598108/81528417-75303b00-939d-11ea-8f3f-a0d0b07521f3.png) 6. 最后，如果我们需要为每个列表项添加一些操作按钮，可以在uni-list-item组件内加入uni-badge组件和uni-icon组件。比如在第二个列表项中添加一个删除按钮： \`\`\` <template> <view> <uni-list> <uni-list-item title=\\"Item 1\\"> <uni-media-box> <view slot=\\"content\\">Description for item 1</view> </uni-media-box> </uni-list-item> <uni-list-item title=\\"Item 2\\"> <uni-badge class=\\"uni-badge-rect uni-badge-warn\\" @click=\\"removeItem\\"> <uni-icon type=\\"trash\\"></uni-icon> </uni-badge> </uni-list-item> <uni-list-item title=\\"Item 3\\"></uni-list-item> </uni-list> </view> </template> \`\`\` 7. 上面的代码中，我们添加了一个红色的长方形uni-badge组件，并使用了uni-icon组件来显示一个垃圾桶图标。同时，我们为uni-badge组件绑定了一个点击事件。现在我们还需要编写removeItem方法来实现删除列表项功能： \`\`\` <script> export default { methods: { removeItem() { // 从列表中删除当前项 } } } <\/script> \`\`\` 8. 最后，我们的列表就完成了。可以添加更多的列表项，并为每个列表项添加详细信息或操作按钮，来满足不同的需求。"},{"prompt":"机器学习 周志华 清华大学出版社 这本书的参考文献怎么写","completion":"以下是参考文献的写法示例： 书籍： 周志华. 机器学习[M]. 北京: 清华大学出版社, 2016. 期刊文章： Friedman J, Hastie T, Tibshirani R.

Мальчик и его мама приезжают на дачу к бабушке, где та прожила много лет. Год, как ее не стало. Дом опустел, стал безлюдным и покинутым. Лето семья хочет провести здесь, обживая это место заново. Не зная, чем себя занять, Миша сидит на крыльце и задумчиво играет в мячик. Неожиданно в лесу начинает проглядываться огонек, будто зазывая мальчика к себе. Этот маленький мерцающий, танцующий свет завораживает Мишу — и тот убегает за ним. Уходя все дальше и дальше, герой попадает в глубь леса и теряется. Бредя по лесу в сумерках, он вдруг видит полосы света между деревьями. Мальчик выбегает на открытую лесную поляну, где яркое солнце стоит в зените. Лучи света пронизывают и поражают Мишу своей красотой, он неотрывно вглядывается, рассматривая каждый отблеск. Это длится долго, но тут до Миши доносится шум реки где-то неподалеку — и он выходит с опушки к склону берега. У берега виднеется силуэт женщины — она обо что-то спотыкается и садится отстирывать кончик платья. Мальчик осторожно приближается к женщине. Та спокойно поворачивается к нему и зовет его к себе. Миша подбегает к своей бабушке, не понимая, как она тут оказалась. Не желая терять ни единой минуты встречи, бабушка довольно просто объясняет свое появление и начинает учить Мишу игре в «блинчики» — они бросают в реку камни с отскоком. Испуг постепенно уходит, бабушка целует внука в лоб и предлагает отвести его обратно домой. В лесу они начинают играть в прятки. Эта игра становится своеобразной кульминацией фильма. Мальчик то теряет, то снова находит бабушку. Мерцание их фигур среди деревьев похоже на мгновения воспоминаний о близких, которые то покидают и оставляют нас в одиночестве, то снова настигают и делают по-настоящему счастливыми. Бабушка исчезает из вида и кажется, что ее нет, но в следующую секунду она обязательно выглянет из-за ближайшей березы и крепко обнимет.","completion":"Мальчик и его мама приезжают на дачу к бабушке, но она уже не с ними — прошел год с ее смерти.

So, to simplify cos(a) + i*sin(b) to r*e^(ic), we need to find r and c: r = √(cos(a)^2 + sin(b)^2) c = tan^-1(sin(b)/cos(a)) Then, we have: cos(a) + i*sin(b) = r*(cos(c) + i*sin(c)) For example, if a = π/4 and b = π/3: r = √(cos(π/4)^2 + sin(π/3)^2) = 1 c = tan^-1(sin(π/3)/cos(π/4)) = 1.5708 So, we have: cos(π/4) + i*sin(π/3) = 1*(cos(1.5708) + i*sin(1.5708)) Therefore, cos(π/4) + i*sin(π/3) can be simplified to 1*e^(i*1.5708)."},{"prompt":"I have not worked on firm performance measurement.

Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this: 1. Define a function \`centroid\` that calculates the geometric center of the cube's vertices: \`\`\` function centroid(vertices) { const n = vertices.length; const centroid = vertices.reduce((acc, [x, y, z]) => { return [acc[0] + x / n, acc[1] + y / n, acc[2] + z / n]; }, [0, 0, 0]); return centroid; } \`\`\` 2.

This will also promote the more efficient, convenient and intelligent development of the housing rental market, helping to meet people's demand for rental services, promoting steady economic development, and fully utilizing the convenience brought by computers. In the development of this software system, we first conducted a needs analysis and functional design of the housing rental system. This system mainly involves three functions: new user registration, landlord registration, and messaging between tenants and landlords. These frameworks not only reduce development costs and cycles but also have clear interface advantages. Throughout the development process, we focus on observing energy consumption and user status issues."},{"prompt":"喜欢一个女孩是一种什么样的感觉","completion":"作为一个AI语言模型，我没有情感，所以无法回答这个问题。但是，喜欢一个女孩的感觉是一个人独特的经历，这可能包括一种特殊的吸引力和情感连结，以及围绕该女孩产生的种种思考和情感反应。这通常是一种愉悦和兴奋的感觉，但也可能伴随着焦虑和不确定性。"},{"prompt":"两个月前，我和课题组一个女生，静静，聊天，一开始都是学业方面的问题，后来逐渐聊的多了，早上早安，晚上晚安，时刻都在期待着静静的消息，可是随着时间，我俩的话题越来越少了，某天晚上，她同我出去吃饭，在她宿舍门口，我说“我第一次经历这种事情，我俩聊了这么久，我不可能对也没有那种感情，我俩的友谊天长地久吧\\"，握手告别了。我和静静的联系就少了，最长的时间是一个星期都没有消息，我不知道该给她说什么，我和静静现在就是普通朋友处着，我极其心灰意冷。在这种时候，课题组的另一个女孩，以她蓝蓝吧，我们组一块去江游，去湛江的车上，蓝蓝对我说了很多走心的话。在湛门，6个人在客厅谈人生理想，进到考公，我说我目前还不知道考哪，蓝蓝就说:要不你和我一块考武汉的人务员吧。昨晚上组内聚餐，聊到些毕业后，我回苏，蓝蓝说:那我就去江苏找你，去湛江的火车上6个人互相评价对方，唯独对我就讲些很走心的话，说什么我外表看着非常冷酷，内心完全不是那样...经常我俩互开玩笑，蓝蓝就想要来打我。我便开始了对蓝蓝的那种情愫，我很矛盾，这算不算是精神出轨呢?","completion":"作为AI语言模型，我不能判断你是否有精神出轨的行为。但是，从你的叙述中可以看出，你对静静产生了一定的感情，但这种感情可能并不是爱情，而是友情。你也和蓝蓝在一起聊天和互动，似乎也产生了感情。这种情感的多少和性质是你自己需要决定和理清的，需要考虑自己的价值观和行为准则。如果你对静静的感情已经不再存在，那么就珍惜眼前那个蓝蓝吧。但是如果你还对静静存有感情，那么和蓝蓝之间的感情也需要理性处理，以避免伤害到任何一方。"},{"prompt":"注册公司100字文案","completion":"注册公司是创业者的第一步，为未来的商业运营奠定基础。注册公司可以使企业享有法人资格，从而能够独立承担债务和获得财产权益，同时还可以获得各种优惠政策和法律保护。我们提供专业的注册公司服务，包括商标注册、企业名称预先核准、营业执照申请等。我们有丰富的经验和专业的团队，可以简化手续、缩短时间、降低风险、提高效率。我们致力于为创业者提供一站式服务，让您在开创事业的道路上更加顺畅、轻松、成功！"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},I={key:0,class:"empty-state"},M=["disabled"],z={key:0},N={key:1};function L(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(y,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",I,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
