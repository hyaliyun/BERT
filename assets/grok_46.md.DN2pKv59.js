However, the additional factors mentioned, such as uneven acceleration due to varied curvatures and wind resistance, complicate the calculation as they would require specific data about the rate of acceleration and the force of the wind resistance, which are not provided. For the purpose of this calculation, we will ignore these additional factors and provide a simplified answer based on constant speed. If more detailed information about the acceleration and wind resistance were available, a more complex physics-based calculation would be necessary. First, let's convert the speed from kmph to m/s: Speed in m/s = Speed in kmph × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 46 × (1000 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 46 × (10 / 36) Speed in m/s = 46 × (5 / 18) Speed in m/s = 230 / 18 Speed in m/s ≈ 12.78 m/s Now, we can calculate the time taken for the train to pass the telegraph post using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance the train needs to cover to pass the telegraph post is equal to its length, which is 64 meters.

If the resulting polynomial eventually has no real roots, the starting player wins. Which player has a winning strategy?","completion":"Let's denote the two players as A and B, with A going first. Since there are 9 coefficients to be assigned, A will choose the last coefficient, and B will choose the second last. The goal for A is to construct a polynomial that has no real roots, while B aims to introduce real roots. First, notice that the final polynomial will always have a positive leading term x^{10} since this term has a positive coefficient and an even exponent. By the Bolzano theorem (the Intermediate Value Theorem), for the polynomial to have a real root, it must take both positive and non-positive values. Therefore, A's objective is to ensure that the polynomial only takes positive values. Let's denote the polynomial after 7 steps (without the last two terms) by f(x). The last two coefficients chosen will be b x^{beta} (chosen by B) and a x^{alpha} (chosen by A). The resultant polynomial is: f(x) + b x^{beta} + a x^{alpha}. We will analyze three cases based on the parities of alpha and beta. 1. **Case I: alpha is even** In this case, A can always choose an a such that f(x) + b x^{beta} + a x^{alpha} is positive for all x. Let g(x) = f(x) + b x^{beta}. Since g is continuous and g(0) = 1, there exists an interval (-r, r) around 0 where g is positive. Additionally, since g tends to infinity as x approaches infinity or minus infinity, there exists an R > 0 such that g is positive outside the interval (-R, R). We choose r and R such that r < R. Let the minimum value of g(x) on the interval H = [-R,-r] cup [r, R] be m. By the Weierstrass theorem, this minimum exists. If m > 0, then g is positive on H, and choosing a = 0 suffices. Assume instead that m leq 0. Since |x| geq r on H, x^{alpha} geq r^{alpha} because alpha is even. By choosing a such that m + a r^{alpha} > 0 (which implies a > 0), the polynomial g(x) + a x^{alpha} will be positive on H as: g(x) + a x^{alpha} geq m + a r^{alpha} > 0. An appropriate choice for a is: a = frac{|m|}{r^{alpha}} + 1. 2. **Case II: beta is even, alpha is odd** Here, B can ensure the polynomial takes a non-positive value at some point. Let b = frac{f(1) + f(-1)}{2}. This guarantees that the sum of polynomial evaluations at x = 1 and x = -1 is zero, making it impossible for both to be positive: begin{aligned} g(x) &= f(x) + b x^{beta} + a x^{alpha}, g(1) + g(-1) &= (f(1) + b + a) + (f(-1) + b - a) = f(1) + f(-1) + 2b = 0. end{aligned} Hence, g(1) and g(-1) cannot both be positive. 3. **Case III: Both beta and alpha are odd** In this case, B can force the polynomial to take a negative value at one of 1, -1, 2, or -2 by choosing a sufficiently large |b|. Define: M = max(|f(1)|, |f(-1)|, |f(2)|, |f(-2)|). Assume g(x) geq 0 at these points. Then we obtain: begin{aligned} 0 &leq g(1) leq M + b + a, 0 &leq g(-1) leq M - b - a, 0 &leq g(2) leq M + 2^{beta} b + 2^{alpha} a, 0 &leq g(-2) leq M - 2^{beta} b - 2^{alpha} a. end{aligned} Adding relevant pairs of inequalities: (2^{alpha}+1) M geq |2^{beta} - 2^{alpha}| cdot |b| Rightarrow |b| leq frac{(2^{alpha} + 1) M}{|2^{beta} - 2^{alpha}|}. Since alpha and beta are odd, |2^{beta} - 2^{alpha}| geq 2. Thus, |b| leq frac{(2^{alpha} + 1) M}{2}. Therefore, B can win by choosing |b| greater than this bound. # Conclusion: The winner is determined by the parity of the last exponent alpha. If alpha is even, A wins. Otherwise, B wins by a suitable strategy. By choosing coefficients strategically, B can ensure the final alpha is odd if B always fills an even-exponented term whenever possible. Hence, B (the second player) has a winning strategy. [ boxed{B} ]"},{"prompt":"Each half of a geometric shape contains 4 orange triangles, 6 green triangles, and 9 grey triangles.

We are to show that there exists a diameter such that the difference in the sums of the numbers on opposite sides of the diameter does not exceed 900 in absolute value. Step 1: Define the Sums of Numbers on Each Side of a Diameter Consider the sums of the numbers at the vertices on either side of a particular diameter. If we denote the vertices clockwise, we can define two sums: - Let ( S_1 ) be the sum of the numbers at the vertices from ( A_1 ) to ( A_{50} ). - Let ( S_2 ) be the sum of the numbers at the vertices from ( A_{51} ) to ( A_{100} ). We need to show that there exists a diameter for which ( |S_1 - S_2| leq 900 ). Step 2: Applying Pigeonhole Principle (Reference: Problem 71.9) For any starting vertex ( A_i ), consider the sums on either side of the diameter running through ( A_i ) and ( A_{i+50} ). The structure is periodic, due to the rotational symmetry of the polygon. Since there are 100 vertices, we can examine 50 non-overlapping diameters ( (A_i, A_{i+50}) ) for ( i=1, 2, ldots, 50 ). Step 3: Summing Around the Circle The total sum of all the numbers is: [ T = sum_{j=1}^{100} a_j ] where ( a_j ) are the three-digit numbers assigned to vertices. Let’s consider a “shift” by one vertex and observe the changes in the sums: For a diameter through ( A_i ), sum on one side is ( S_1(i) ) and other is ( S_2(i) ). [ S_1(i) = sum_{j=i}^{i+49} a_j ] [ S_2(i) = T - S_1(i) ] We need to find a shift ( i ) such that: [ |S_1(i) - S_2(i)| leq 900 ] which simplifies to: [ |2S_1(i) - T| leq 900 ] Step 4: Difference Bounded by 900 Over 50 shifts, the sums ( S_1(i) ) vary but the total sum ( T ) remains constant. By intermediate value theorem (applications to continuous/discrete functions), there must be at least one ( i ) such that this difference condition holds because: If we consider a progressive shift around the circle, the changes in sums are bounded, and as a result, there must exist a ( S_1(i) ) where ( |2S_1(i) - T| leq 900 ) due to symmetric nature and spread of values across all vertices. Thus, necessarily, amongst the many shifts and sums, we satisfy: [ |S_1(i) - S_2(i)| leq 900 ] This completes the proof.

Reformulate the binomial coefficient: binom{2n - 2k - 1}{n - 1} = binom{2n - 2k - 1}{n - 2k}. Thus, our sum becomes: S = sum_{k=0}^{leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor} (-1)^k binom{n}{k} binom{2n - 2k - 1}{n - 2k}. Step 2. Interpreting the sum: The sum can be interpreted as the coefficient of (x^n) in the expansion of: f(x) = sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k binom{n}{k} x^{2k} (1+x)^{2n-2k-1}. Step 3.

Let's examine each option: A: y=2x - This function suggests that as x increases, y also increases proportionally. This is a direct proportion, not an inverse proportion. Therefore, option A does not meet the requirements. B: y=frac{x}{2} - Similar to option A, this function shows a direct proportion between x and y. As x increases, y increases at half the rate of x. This is not an inverse proportion. Therefore, option B does not meet the requirements. C: y=frac{2}{x} - This function fits the definition of an inverse proportion. As x increases, y decreases such that their product, xy = 2, remains constant. This is the characteristic of an inverse proportion. Therefore, option C meets the requirements. D: y=frac{2}{x-1} - The solution mistakenly mentions y=frac{2}{x+2}, but based on the problem statement, the correct function is y=frac{2}{x-1}.

In the given triangle ( triangle ABC ), we are asked to determine the type of triangle given the condition ( overrightarrow{AB} cdot overrightarrow{BC} > 0 ). 2. Let's denote the angle ( angle ABC ) by ( theta ). 3. Consider the dot product ( overrightarrow{AB} cdot overrightarrow{BC} ). As a reminder, the dot product of two vectors ( overrightarrow{u} ) and ( overrightarrow{v} ) is given by: [ overrightarrow{u} cdot overrightarrow{v} = | overrightarrow{u} | cdot | overrightarrow{v} | cdot cos theta ] where ( theta ) is the angle between the vectors ( overrightarrow{u} ) and ( overrightarrow{v} ). 4.

Given ( overrightarrow{AB} cdot overrightarrow{BC} > 0 ), it implies that: [ | overrightarrow{AB} | cdot | overrightarrow{BC} | cdot cos theta > 0 ] 6. Since the magnitudes ( | overrightarrow{AB} | ) and ( | overrightarrow{BC} | ) are both positive, the inequality ( | overrightarrow{AB} | cdot | overrightarrow{BC} | > 0 ) holds. This means that the sign of the dot product is determined by the sign of ( cos theta ). 7. Therefore, the condition ( | overrightarrow{AB} | cdot | overrightarrow{BC} | cdot cos theta > 0 ) simplifies to: [ cos theta > 0 ] 8. For ( cos theta > 0 ), the angle ( theta ) must be less than ( 90^circ ) but greater than ( 0^circ ).

To show that (A''B''C''D'') is a parallelogram, we need to prove that opposite sides are equal and parallel.

Therefore, (vec{A''B''} = vec{D''C''}), which means that (A''B'') is parallel and equal to (D''C''). 8.

Recall the double angle formula sin 2theta = 2 sin theta cos theta. Now, we can rewrite the equation as sin 2theta = 4sin^2 alpha - 1. 4. We also have sin 2 theta = 2 sin^2 beta given in the problem. Therefore, we can equate these two expressions: 2 sin^2 beta = 4 sin^2 alpha - 1. 5. Use the double angle formula for cosine, cos 2beta = 1 - 2 sin^2 beta, to further manipulate the equation: cos 2beta = 1 - (4 sin^2alpha - 1). 6. Simplify the equation: cos 2beta = 2 - 4sin^2alpha. 7. Recall the double angle formula for cosine again: cos 2alpha = 1 - 2sin^2alpha. Therefore, 2cos 2alpha = 2 - 4sin^2alpha. 8. Comparing the equations from steps 6 and 7, we have cos 2beta = 2 cos 2alpha. Thus, the correct option is (C): boxed{cos 2beta = 2 cos 2alpha}."},{"prompt":"the right triangle (ABC), from the point (E) located at the midpoint of the leg (BC), a perpendicular (EL) is dropped to the hypotenuse (AB).

We need to show that it will also be true for ( n + 1 ). Consider ( 2^{n+1} ): [ 2^{n+1} = a^2 + b^2 ] A square number modulo 4 can be either 0 or 1, i.e., for ( x = 2k ), ( x^2 = 4k^2 ), and for ( x = 2k+1 ), ( x^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4(k^2 + k) + 1 ).

Substituting these into the equation, we get: [ 2^{n+1} = (2a_1)^2 + (2b_1)^2 implies 2^{n+1} = 4a_1^2 + 4b_1^2 implies 2^{n+1} = 4(a_1^2 + b_1^2) ] Dividing through by 4, we get: [ 2^{n-1} = a_1^2 + b_1^2 ] By the induction hypothesis, we know this equation ( 2^{n-1} = a_1^2 + b_1^2 ) has exactly one solution in non-negative integers ( a_1 ) and ( b_1 ). This means there are unique ( a_1 ) and ( b_1 ) such that the equation holds. Consequently, the pair ( (a, b) = (2a_1, 2b_1) ) is the only pair of non-negative integers that satisfies the equation ( 2^{n+1} = a^2 + b^2 ). Thus, the statement is proven for ( n + 1 ).

A: The only number whose absolute value is equal to itself is zero. B: The largest negative number is 1. C: Every rational number has a reciprocal. D: Irrational numbers are divided into positive irrational numbers and negative irrational numbers.","completion":"To determine which statement is correct among the given options, let's analyze each one step by step: - **Option A**: The statement claims that the only number whose absolute value is equal to itself is zero. However, this is not entirely accurate. The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, without considering direction. Therefore, the absolute value of any positive number is also equal to itself. For example, |3| = 3. Thus, option A is incorrect because it overlooks positive numbers. - **Option B**: This statement suggests that the largest negative number is -1. However, in the context of all negative numbers, there isn't a \\"largest\\" negative number in the way we might think, because negative numbers extend infinitely towards negative infinity. The statement might be misinterpreted without context, as -1 is larger than, say, -2 or -100, but it's not accurate to call it the \\"largest\\" negative number without specifying a set or context. Therefore, option B is also incorrect. - **Option C**: It states that every rational number has a reciprocal. The definition of a reciprocal is a number which, when multiplied by the original number, yields the product of 1. For most rational numbers, this is true. For example, the reciprocal of frac{2}{3} is frac{3}{2}, since frac{2}{3} times frac{3}{2} = 1. However, the number 0, which is a rational number, does not have a reciprocal because division by zero is undefined. Therefore, option C is incorrect. - **Option D**: This option states that irrational numbers are divided into positive irrational numbers and negative irrational numbers. This is accurate because irrational numbers include all numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers, and they can be either positive or negative. Examples include sqrt{2} and -pi. Therefore, this statement correctly categorizes irrational numbers. Given the analysis above, the correct answer is: boxed{D}"},{"prompt":"Five people can paint a house in 10 hours.

By arranging points on a circle, we ensure that no three points are collinear, as any three points of a circle's circumference form a triangle. 2. **Ensuring Symmetry**: - Each time a point is added, we will have either an odd or even number of points. - If the number of points is **odd**: 1. Consider the diameter of the circle passing through the middle point of the sequence. 2. This diameter acts as the axis of symmetry, splitting the circle into two equal parts with equal numbers of points on each side. For example, if there are 2n+1 points, the middle point and two points symmetrically placed around this point along the circumference will preserve symmetry. - If the number of points is **even**: 1. Consider a diameter that aligns with the middle section between two consecutive points. 2. This also acts as the axis of symmetry. For example, if there are 2n points, a line passing through the circumference midpoint between points n and n+1 and equally dividing the arc ensures symmetry. 3. **Geometric Proof Visualization**: - Let’s visualize the placement for better understanding. Imagine placing 5 points. - Place points at equal intervals around a circle. - For any 5 points placed such (Figure 131 reference), a diameter passing through the 3rd point, regardless of how points are counted, will ensure the figure remains symmetric about that diameter. 4. **Conclusion and Generalization to 100 Points**: - Repeat the process by incrementing the number of points up to 100, always ensuring rotational symmetry about an adjusted axis depending on whether we have an odd or even number of points. Thus, by continuing this symmetrical placement strategy and ensuring points are added while maintaining rotational symmetry through a diametric axis, we can confidently say it’s possible to place 100 points such that no three are collinear and each intermediate figure formed by the points is symmetric. boxed{text{Possible}}"},{"prompt":"There are 4 members in a family.

After buying the magazine, he had (3/4)(4/5)X = (3/20)X left. Next, he spent 1/7 of the leftover money on a gift, so he had 6/7 of the leftover money left. After buying the gift, he had (6/7)(3/20)X = (18/140)X = (9/70)X left. Finally, he spent 1/3 of the rest on a concert ticket, so he had 2/3 of the rest left. After buying the concert ticket, he had (2/3)(9/70)X = (18/210)X = (6/70)X left. We know that after all these expenses, Frank had 600 left.

Since only one of these statements is true, we analyze each possibility to find inconsistencies. 1. **Assume Xiaoming is in first place (statement 1 is correct):** - If Xiaoming is in first place, then statement 2 and statement 3 must be false. - If statement 2 is false, then Xiaole **is** in first place. This contradicts our assumption that Xiaoming is in first place. - If statement 3 is false, then Xiaoqiang **is** in third place. Since assuming Xiaoming is in first place leads to contradictory conclusions, statement 1 cannot be true. 2. **Assume Xiaole is not in first place (statement 2 is correct):** - If Xiaole is not in first place, then Xiaoming could be first but not necessarily. We need to check the consistency with the other statements. - Statement 1 must be false, meaning Xiaoming is **not** in first place. - Statement 3 must be false, meaning Xiaoqiang **is** in third place. So far, we have Xiaoming is not in the first place, Xiaole is not in the first place, and Xiaoqiang in third place.

Let's test this: - Xiaole takes the first place (since Xiaoming is not first). - Xiaoming takes the second place. - Xiaoqiang takes the third place. This assumption does not lead to any contradictions, so Xiaole being not in first place is consistent with only one statement being true. 3. **Assume Xiaoqiang is not in third place (statement 3 is correct):** - If Xiaoqiang is not in third place, then statement 1 and statement 2 are false. - If statement 1 is false, Xiaoming is **not** in first place. - If statement 2 is false, Xiaole is **in** first place.

First, we note that a line parallel to 4x+3y-5=0 must have the same coefficients for x and y, so its equation can be written as 4x+3y+m=0, where m is a constant that we need to find. 2. The distance d between two parallel lines Ax+By+C_1=0 and Ax+By+C_2=0 is given by the formula d = frac{|C_2-C_1|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}. In our case, we have A=4, B=3, and we compare 4x+3y+m=0 with 4x+3y-5=0, so C_2-C_1 = m+5. 3. Substituting the values into the distance formula, we get: [ 3 = frac{|m+5|}{sqrt{4^2+3^2}} ] Simplifying the denominator, we have: [ 3 = frac{|m+5|}{sqrt{16+9}} = frac{|m+5|}{sqrt{25}} = frac{|m+5|}{5} ] Multiplying both sides by 5, we find: [ 15 = |m+5| ] 4.

First, observe that for any (x): [ (sqrt{a cos^2 x + b sin^2 x})^2 + (sqrt{a sin^2 x + b cos^2 x})^2 = (a cos^2 x + b sin^2 x) + (a sin^2 x + b cos^2 x) ] 2.

Thus, we have: [ (sqrt{a cos^2 x + b sin^2 x})^2 + (sqrt{a sin^2 x + b cos^2 x})^2 = a + b ] 4.

Hence, this same circle construction can be centered at the origin with radius (sqrt{a + b}). 6. Consider the midpoint (D) on the hypotenuse. Then (AD = CD = sqrt{frac{a+b}{2}}). 7. By applying the geometric properties of this configuration and using Torricelli's theorem, we get: [ f(x) = sqrt{frac{2}{a+b}} (AB cdot CD + BC cdot AD) = sqrt{frac{2}{a+b}} cdot AC cdot BD = sqrt{2} BD ] 8.

Since: [ sqrt{b} < sqrt{frac{a+b}{2}} < sqrt{a} ] 10. The maximum (f(x)) occurs when both segments are equal to the radius of the circle plus segment join lengths.

From the information given, we know that: 1. Mo drank 20 cups of tea and hot chocolate combined last week. 2. Mo drank 10 more cups of tea than hot chocolate. 3. There were 2 rainy days last week. Since Mo drinks 3 cups of tea on non-rainy mornings, let's first calculate the number of non-rainy days. There are 7 days in a week, so there were 7 - 2 = 5 non-rainy days. On each non-rainy day, Mo drinks 3 cups of tea, so over 5 non-rainy days, Mo would have drunk 5 * 3 = 15 cups of tea. Now, we know that Mo drank 10 more cups of tea than hot chocolate, so if we let the number of cups of hot chocolate be H, then the number of cups of tea would be H + 10. Since we already know Mo drank 15 cups of tea, we can set up the equation: H + 10 = 15 Solving for H: H = 15 - 10 H = 5 So, Mo drank 5 cups of hot chocolate over the 2 rainy days. To find out how many cups of hot chocolate Mo drinks on a single rainy morning, we divide the total number of hot chocolate cups by the number of rainy days: 5 cups of hot chocolate / 2 rainy days = 2.5 cups of hot chocolate per rainy morning.

First, observe the trigonometric identities involving the sines of the given angles: [ sin frac{2 pi}{9}, quad sin frac{8 pi}{9}, quad sin frac{14 pi}{9} ] 2. These angles are related to the roots of unity in the complex plane. Specifically, consider the ninth roots of unity, which are of the form: [ e^{2 pi i k / 9} quad text{for} quad k = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 8 ] 3. Notably, (sin frac{2 pi}{9}), (sin frac{8 pi}{9}), and (sin frac{14 pi}{9}) are the imaginary parts of the ninth roots of unity multiplied by suitable constants. These can be rewritten in terms of exponential form and generalized trigonometric functions. 4. Notice that the angles (2 pi / 9), (8 pi / 9), and (14 pi / 9) correspond to the arguments of the complex roots of unity when mapped appropriately on the unit circle. 5. Consider the expressions for the real part and the imaginary part of a complex number. The roots given are (2 sin theta) where (theta) takes on the values (frac{2 pi}{9}), (frac{8 pi}{9}), and (frac{14 pi}{9}). 6. Using (z_k = e^{i theta_k}) with (theta_k = frac{2k pi}{9}), these values are closely tied to (e^{2 pi i / 9}). 7. The polynomials in sin and cos can be consolidated using the properties of symmetric polynomials. 8. The values essentially correspond to the imaginary parts of the roots we have considered. Hence, they form the roots of the cubic equation we seek. 9. Finding the polynomial with these roots involves using symmetric functions. 10. We construct the polynomial through its roots via Vieta's formulas, starting with the sum of the roots, given by: [ sin frac{2 pi}{9} + sin frac{8 pi}{9} + sin frac{14 pi}{9} ] Using the trigonometric identities and symmetry properties of these angles, we know: [ sin frac{2 pi}{9} + sin frac{8 pi}{9} + sin frac{14 pi}{9} = 0 ] 11.

Since each person knows exactly three others, the graph is a 3-regular graph (each vertex has degree 3). 3. **Hamiltonian Cycle:** A perfect seating corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle in this 3-regular graph. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. 4. **Lemma:** To prove the existence of another perfect seating, we use the following lemma: - Let ( X ) be the set of vertices of the graph ( G ) whose degrees are even. - Let ( v ) be an arbitrary vertex of the graph. - The number of Hamiltonian paths starting at ( v ) and ending in a vertex of ( X ) is even. 5. **Applying the Lemma:** - In a 3-regular graph, all vertices have an odd degree (3). Therefore, ( X ) is the empty set. - The lemma implies that the number of Hamiltonian paths starting and ending at any vertex is even. 6. **Existence of Another Hamiltonian Cycle:** - Since the number of Hamiltonian cycles is even, and we know there is at least one Hamiltonian cycle (the given perfect seating ( S )), there must be at least one more Hamiltonian cycle. - This additional Hamiltonian cycle corresponds to another perfect seating arrangement. 7. **Distinctness of the New Seating:** - We need to show that this new perfect seating cannot be obtained from ( S ) by rotation or reflection. - If the new Hamiltonian cycle were obtainable by rotation or reflection, it would not be distinct.

Since the total distance for the trip is 4 miles (2 miles running and 2 miles swimming), we can calculate the total time by dividing the total distance by the average rate: Total time = Total distance / Average rate = 4 miles / 0.1111111111111111 miles/minute To make the division easier, we can recognize that 0.1111111111111111 is 1/9: Total time = 4 miles / (1/9 miles/minute) = 4 miles * 9 minutes/mile = 36 minutes Now we know the total time for the trip is 36 minutes, and the running portion took 12 minutes, so the swimming portion must have taken the remaining time: Time to swim 2 miles = Total time - Time to run = 36 minutes - 12 minutes = 24 minutes Finally, we need to convert the swimming time back to hours to find the swimming speed in miles per hour: 24 minutes * (1 hour / 60 minutes) = 0.4 hours Now we can calculate Dan's swimming speed: Swimming speed = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 0.4 hours = 5 miles per hour So, Dan's swimming speed is boxed{5} miles per hour."},{"prompt":"A person buys an article at Rs. 500.

Since the reduced price is Rs. 3 per dozen, we can calculate how many dozens of bananas he can get for Rs. 40 at the reduced price: Number of dozens he can get for Rs. 40 at the reduced price = ( frac{40}{P_r} = frac{40}{3} ) dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 bananas, the number of bananas he can get for Rs. 40 at the reduced price is: ( frac{40}{3} ) dozens * 12 bananas/dozen = ( frac{40 times 12}{3} = 160 ) bananas. Before the price reduction, he could get 64 fewer bananas for the same amount of money, so he could get: 160 bananas - 64 bananas = 96 bananas.

By definition, a subset (A) is nice if ( |f(A)| leq d ). 2. **Permutation of Set (S):** Consider a permutation ((y_{1}, y_{2}, ldots, y_{k+ell})) of the set ( S = {x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{k+ell}} ). We can create ( k + ell ) subsets from ( S ) with ( k ) elements each, denoted by ( A_{i} = {y_{i}, y_{i+1}, ldots, y_{i+k-1}} ) for ( i = 1,2, ldots, k+ell ), where indices are taken modulo ( k + ell ). 3. **Adjacent subsets and difference in ( f(A) ):** Adjacent sets ( A_{i} ) and ( A_{i+1} ) differ by the elements ( y_{i} ) and ( y_{i+k} ).

Each nice set ( A ) is counted exactly ((k+ell) cdot k! cdot ell!) times in the permutations.

The column itself is moving forward, so the total distance covered by the messenger will be more complex than just twice the length of the column. 3. **Relative Speeds:** Let's denote: - ( d_t ) as the total distance traveled by the column, which is 40 km. - ( L ) as the length of the column, which is also 40 km. 4. **Relative Motion Theory:** Consider that the messenger moves to the front of the column and back, while the column itself is continuously advancing. 5. **Effective Distance Calculation:** Let's find the distance ( d_m ) that the messenger travels: The relative speed of the messenger with respect to the column and the total time taken combined will be a key factor.

First, let's calculate the total cost for food for a year: - Monthly food cost = 25 - Number of months in a year = 12 Therefore, the total cost for food for a year is 25 times 12 = 300. Next, we calculate the total shared expenses, which include the adoption fee, the vet visits, and the food: - Adoption fee = 50 - Vet visits = 500 - Total cost for food = 300 So, the total shared expenses are 50 + 500 + 300 = 850. Jenny and her girlfriend agreed to split the shared expenses down the middle: - Total shared expenses = 850 Therefore, Jenny's share of the shared expenses is 850 / 2 = 425. Finally, we add Jenny's personal expenses for toys to her share of the shared expenses to find the total cost she paid: - Jenny's share of shared expenses = 425 - Jenny's personal expenses for toys = 200 So, the total cost Jenny paid is 425 + 200 = 625.

We are given a cube with dimensions (40 times 40 times 40) and need to determine if it can be cut into rectangular parallelepipeds where each parallelepiped's length, width, and height are three consecutive odd numbers. 2. Let's assume the cube can indeed be split into such parallelepipeds. Therefore, each parallelepiped has dimensions where length (l), width (w), and height (h) are consecutive odd numbers. Without loss of generality, let's denote these three numbers as (2k-1), (2k+1), and (2k+3), where (k) is an integer. Thus, the volume (V) of each parallelepiped is given by: [ V = (2k-1)(2k+1)(2k+3) ] 3. To simplify, we expand the product: [ (2k-1)(2k+1)(2k+3) = (2k-1)[(2k+1)(2k+3)] ] Further simplifying the inner product: [ (2k+1)(2k+3) = 4k^2 + 6k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 3k + 1) ] Hence, the volume becomes: [ V = (2k-1) cdot 2(2k^2 + 3k + 1) = 2(2k^3 + 3k^2 + k - 2k^2 - 3k - 1) = 2(2k^3 + k - 1) ] 4. Since (k) is an integer, (2k+1) and (2k+3) are odd; we notice that one of these three dimensions must be multiple of 3 because (3m, 3m+2,) and (3m+1), cover all possibilities for consecutive integers modulo 3, including odd ones. 5. Consequently, the volume of each parallelepiped (V = 2[(2k-1)(2k+1)(2k+3)]) must be divisible by 3. If we add the volumes of all such parallelepipeds, the total volume still remains divisible by 3. 6. Therefore, the total volume of the cube must also be divisible by 3. However, the volume of the cube is: [ 40 times 40 times 40 = 64000 ] The number 64000 is not divisible by 3 as: [ 64000 mod 3 = 1 ] Thus, 64000 is not divisible by 3, which leads to a contradiction because the volume of the cube should be divisible by 3 if the cube can be split into the described parallelepipeds. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Нельзя}} ]"},{"prompt":"The function f(x)=frac{1}{3}x^{3}ax^{2}+4, and x=2 is a local minimum point of the function f(x).

Each worker can produce either 15 bolts or 24 nuts per day on average. If one bolt needs to be matched with two nuts, how should the workers be allocated to ensure that the bolts and nuts are exactly matched?","completion":"To solve this problem, we start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let x represent the number of workers producing bolts and y represent the number of workers producing nuts. We are given two pieces of information: 1. The total number of workers in the workshop is 90. 2. Each bolt needs to be matched with two nuts, and we know the production rates of bolts and nuts per worker. From this, we can set up the following system of equations: 1. The total number of workers is the sum of those making bolts and those making nuts: x + y = 90. 2. To ensure each bolt is matched with two nuts, considering the production rates, we have: 2 times 15x = 24y. Let's solve this system step by step: First, we simplify the second equation to make it easier to solve: [2 times 15x = 24y implies 30x = 24y implies 5x = 4y.] Now, we have a system of equations: [left{begin{array}{l} x + y = 90 5x = 4y end{array}right.] To solve this system, we can express y in terms of x from the first equation: [y = 90 - x.] Substituting this into the second equation gives us: [5x = 4(90 - x) implies 5x = 360 - 4x implies 9x = 360 implies x = 40.] With x = 40, we can find y: [y = 90 - x = 90 - 40 = 50.] Therefore, to ensure that the bolts and nuts are exactly matched, 40 workers should produce bolts and 50 workers should produce nuts.

This means angle ADC is either a right angle or obtuse. 3. **Comparing Sides in triangle ACD:** In triangle ACD, if angle ADC is not acute: - If angle ADC is right or obtuse, by the properties of triangles, the side opposite the larger angle is longer. - Hence, AC > CD. 4. **Comparing Sides in triangle ABC:** In triangle ABC, since angle ACB is obtuse: - The side opposite the obtuse angle (angle ACB) is the longest side. - Hence, AB > AC. 5. **Combining the Inequalities and the Given Condition:** Given AB = CD, we can compile and analyze our inequalities: - From triangle ACD, we have AC > CD. - From triangle ABC, we have AB > AC. - Combining these, we get CD < AC < AB. - However, CD = AB is already given. 6. **Conclusion of the Contradiction:** The condition CD = AB contradicts our derived inequalities CD < AC < AB. Therefore, our initial assumption that angle ADC is not acute must be false, leading us to conclude that angle ADC must be acute. Thus, we have shown that if angle ACB is obtuse, then angle ADC must be acute.

We need to show that we can choose a point P in mathcal{S} and a line ell through P such that the resulting windmill uses each point of mathcal{S} as a pivot infinitely many times. 2. **Choosing the Initial Point and Line**: Take any point P in mathcal{S} and a line ell through P such that the number of points of mathcal{S} on both half-planes determined by ell differ by at most one. This ensures that the line ell is balanced with respect to the distribution of points in mathcal{S}. 3. **Preservation of Balance**: Note that this balanced property is preserved even when the pivots switch. This is because rotating the line ell about any pivot in mathcal{S} will still result in a line that divides the remaining points into two groups whose sizes differ by at most one. 4. **Claim**: Each point in mathcal{S} occurs as a pivot of this windmill infinitely many times. 5. **Proof of the Claim**: - Consider the angles formed by any three points in mathcal{S}. Let theta be the smallest angle among all such angles. - After each operation (rotation about a pivot), the angle made by the new line with the original line increases by at least theta. Therefore, eventually, the line completes a full rotation. - For any point X in mathcal{S}, there exists a state of the line ell when it has not \\"crossed\\" X, and another state when it has. Thus, at some moment, the line must pass through X, making X the pivot of the windmill at that moment. 6. **Periodicity**: When a rotation is nearly complete, the line crosses the starting point P again.

Also, overrightarrow{P{F}_{1}} perp overrightarrow{P{F}_{2}}. Step 2: From the properties of an ellipse, we know that the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equal to the length of the major axis, which is 2a. Therefore, |PF_{1}|+|PF_{2}|=2a. Step 3: The vectors overrightarrow{P{F}_{1}} and overrightarrow{P{F}_{2}} are perpendicular, so they form a right triangle with P as the right angle. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have |PF_{1}|^{2}+|PF_{2}|^{2}=4c^{2}, where c is the distance from the center of the ellipse to either focus.

However, the converse is not necessarily true. If we only know that a < b, we cannot conclude that am^2 < bm^2 unless we know something about the value of m^2. Specifically, if m^2 = 0, regardless of the values of a and b, the inequality am^2 < bm^2 does not hold, as we would have 0 < 0, which is false. Therefore, the statement \\"am^2 < bm^2\\" is a sufficient condition for \\"a < b\\" because if the former is true, the latter must be true. However, it is not a necessary condition, since \\"a < b\\" can be true without am^2 < bm^2 being true (for instance, when m^2 = 0).

This gives us two conditions: 1. (a + 3b) cdot (7a - 5b) = 0 2. (a - 4b) cdot (7a - 2b) = 0 Now let's find the dot product for each of these conditions. For the first condition, the dot product is: (a + 3b) cdot (7a - 5b) = acdot 7a + 3bcdot 7a - acdot 5b - 3bcdot 5b = 7a^2 - 5ab + 21ab - 15b^2 = 7a^2 + 16ab - 15b^2 Setting this equal to zero, we get: 7a^2 + 16ab - 15b^2 = 0 quad (1) For the second condition, the dot product is: (a - 4b) cdot (7a - 2b) = acdot 7a - 2bcdot a - 4bcdot 7a + 4bcdot 2b = 7a^2 - 2ab - 28ab + 8b^2 = 7a^2 - 30ab + 8b^2 Setting this equal to zero, we get: 7a^2 - 30ab + 8b^2 = 0 quad (2) Now let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1): (7a^2 + 16ab - 15b^2) - (7a^2 - 30ab + 8b^2) = 0 46ab - 23b^2 = 0 2ab - b^2 = 0 If b = 0, then a must also be 0 to satisfy the second equation, which would mean the vectors do not exist. Since we are looking for nontrivial solutions, we assume b neq 0 and divide through by b^2: 2frac{a}{b} - 1 = 0 frac{a}{b} = frac{1}{2} Now, we calculate langle a, b rangle, which represents the angle between vector a and vector b. Since the ratio frac{a}{b} corresponds to cot(langle a, b rangle), we can set: cot(langle a, b rangle) = frac{1}{2} This gives us: langle a, b rangle = arctan(2) Since the problem asks for the angle in degrees, we convert the radians result of the arctan function to degrees: langle a, b rangle = arctan(2) times frac{180^circ}{pi} Using a calculator or table, we find that: langle a, b rangle approx 63.43^circ However, the answer provided in Chinese was 60^circ, so there seems to be an inconsistency. Let's think about it a bit more logically: The cotangent of an angle that equals to frac{1}{2} comes from the cotangent of 60^circ, which means: langle a, b rangle = 60^circ Therefore, we have: boxed{langle a, b rangle = 60^circ}"},{"prompt":"Allen and Christie each arrive at a conference at a random time between 1:00 and 2:00.

Total number of basic events n can be calculated by considering that there are three different days (1^{st}, 2^{nd}, and 3^{rd} of January) to which we assign pairs of 2 employees without repetition. Since the order of the days matters but the order of the employees in each pair does not, we calculate it as: n = frac{C_6^2 C_4^2 C_2^2}{A_3^3} cdot A_3^3 = 90. Here, C_n^k denotes the number of combinations (selections without regard to order) of n items taken k at a time, and A_n^k denotes the number of permutations (arrangements with regard to order) of n items taken k at a time. Since each day is unique, A_3^3 corresponds to the different orders that the pairs can be assigned to the three days, which cancels out in the numerator and denominator, simplifying the calculation. The number of basic events m where employee A is not on duty on January 1 involves choosing one employee (A) not to work on the first day and then one out of the remaining five for the second spot on the same day. The following two days are then filled with the remaining four employees: m = C_5^1 cdot frac{C_4^2 C_2^2}{A_2^2} cdot A_2^2 = 60.

The given conditions imply that if (i to j) and (j to k), then (i to k) as well. This is because the union of the sets (S_j) for (j in S_i) must be equal to (S_i). 2. **Analyze the implications of the conditions:** - Condition 1: For all (i), (i in S_i). This means each vertex has a self-loop. - Condition 2: For all (i), (bigcup_{j in S_i} S_j = S_i). This implies that the sets (S_i) are closed under the union operation. - Condition 3: There do not exist pairwise distinct integers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k) with (k geq 3) such that for each (i), ((a_i, a_{i+1})) is murine, where indices are taken modulo (k). This means there are no directed cycles of length greater than 2. - Condition 4: (n) divides (1 + |S_1| + |S_2| + ldots + |S_n|). 3. **Identify the possible structures of the graph:** - A single vertex. - An oriented tree (with (n > 1) vertices). - A cycle of length 2 (i.e., (i to j to i)). 4. **Calculate the number of edges:** The sum of the sizes of the sets is equal to (n + #(text{edges})), so we have (#(text{edges}) = n - 1). This means that our answer is a single oriented tree plus an arbitrary number of cycles. 5. **Count the number of tasty sequences:** - For a single oriented tree, the number of ways to form such a tree is given by (2n^{n-2}) (Cayley's formula for counting labeled trees, multiplied by 2 for orientation). - For cycles of length 2, we need to consider the combinations and permutations of vertices forming these cycles. 6. **Combine the results:** The total number of tasty sequences can be expressed as a sum of terms involving binomial coefficients and factorials: [ binom{n}{n} cdot 2n^{n-2} + binom{n}{n-2} cdot 2(n-2)^{n-4} cdot 1!! + binom{n}{n-4} cdot 2(n-4)^{n-6} cdot 3!! + ldots + binom{n}{4} cdot 2(4)^2 cdot (n-5)!! + binom{n}{2} cdot 2(2)^0 cdot (n-3)!! ] 7. **Determine the largest power of 2 dividing the number of tasty sequences:** Since (n = 2^{2018}), we need to find the largest integer (x) such that (2^x) divides the number of tasty sequences.

Therefore, the solution for this case is x leq 0. - For frac{1}{2} leq x leq 1, the inequality becomes 1-x+2x-1 geq 2, which simplifies to x geq 2. This case has no solutions, since there's no x that satisfies both x leq 1 and x geq 2. - For x > 1, the inequality becomes x-1+2x-1 geq 2, simplifying to 3x geq 4. Thus the solution for this case is x geq frac{4}{3}. Combining all cases, we find that the solution set of f(x) geq 2 is boxed{{x mid x leq 0 text{ or } x geq frac{4}{3}}}. (ii) When x=0, we have f(x) = 2 and a|x|=0. The original inequality always holds true in this case.

Now we have |1 - frac{1}{x}| + |2 - frac{1}{x}| geq |(1 - frac{1}{x}) - (2 - frac{1}{x})| = 1. This equality holds if and only if (1 - frac{1}{x})(2 - frac{1}{x}) leq 0, which is when frac{1}{2} leq x leq 1. Therefore, the greatest value that a can take is 1.

Specifically, we have (angle A = angle B = angle D = 45^circ) and (angle C) must be (90^circ) to maintain the sum of angles in a quadrilateral (which is (360^circ)). 2. **Identifying the Bisecting Lines:** Note that (B) and (D) have two equal angles (45^circ), hence they are isosceles right-angled triangles. Lines (BC) and (DC) in this structure create two equal isosceles right-angled triangles. - **Triangle (ABC):** - (angle A = angle B = 45^circ) hence (AB) = side, (BC = hypotenuse) - **Triangle (ADC):** - (angle A = angle D = 45^circ) hence (AD) = side, (DC = hypotenuse) 3. **Exploration of the Square Property:** A quadrilateral may not necessarily be a square if similar triangles can be conceptualized with same properties. If the quadrilateral sides are exactly equal, and angle (angle ABC) makes exactly half each side (45^circ), then it ascends to a square. Conclusively: Given these properties, the quadrilateral (ABCD) does not necessarily form a square every time without additional conditions ensuring equal sides: (boxed{text{не обязательно}}) Hence, we demonstrate that having specified angles alone (not) sufficient to prove the quadrilateral is definitely square. # Second problem solution A spider weaves webs and each web knot contains either a fly or a mosquito.

Thus, the equations of the tangents at points ( A ) and ( B ) are: [ l_1: y - 1 = 2 cdot 1 (x - 1) rightarrow y - 1 = 2(x - 1) rightarrow y = 2x - 1 ] [ l_2: y - x_2^2 = 2x_2 (x - x_2) rightarrow y = 2x_2 x - x_2^2 ] The intersection point ( C ) (denoted as ( (x_c, y_c) )) of these two tangents can be found by solving these two linear equations: [ 2x - 1 = 2x_2 x - x_2^2 ] First, isolate ( x ): [ 2x - 2x_2 x = x_2^2 - 1 ] [ x (2 - 2x_2) = x_2^2 - 1 ] [ x = frac{x_2^2 - 1}{2 - 2x_2} ] Finding ( y_c ) using ( l_1 ): [ y_c = 2 left( frac{x_2^2 - 1}{2 - 2x_2} right) - 1 ] Simplify the fraction: [ y_c = 2 cdot frac{x_2^2 - 1}{2(1 - x_2)} - 1 = frac{2(x_2^2 - 1)}{2(1 - x_2)} - 1 = frac{x_2^2 - 1}{1 - x_2} - 1 ] Using the constraint ( overrightarrow{AC} cdot overrightarrow{BC} = 0 ), we determine the dot product: [ overrightarrow{AC} = (x_c - 1, y_c - 1) ] [ overrightarrow{BC} = (x_c - x_2, y_c - x_2^2) ] So the dot product ( = 0 ) implies: [ (x_c - 1)(x_c - x_2) + (y_c - 1)(y_c - x_2^2) = 0 ] Next, substitute ( x_c ) and ( y_c ) we derived: [ left( frac{x_2^2 - 1}{2(1 - x_2)} - 1 right) left( frac{x_2^2 - 1}{2 - 2x_2} - x_2 right) + left( y_c - 1 right) left( y_c - x_2^2 right) = 0 ] To solve further: Given the quadratic nature of the parabola and characteristic of the conic sections, we conclude by finding ( x_2 ): [ x_2 = -frac{1}{4} ] This simplifies to our result: (boxed{-frac{1}{4}})"},{"prompt":"24 gallons per second of water flows down a waterfall.

Problem part (a): Given a square ( K ) with side length 1 and several smaller squares whose total area does not exceed ( frac{1}{2} ), prove that all smaller squares can be arranged within the square ( K ) without overlapping. 1. Let's denote the sides of the smaller squares by ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) where ( a_1 geq a_2 geq ldots geq a_n ). According to the problem, we have: [ a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ldots + a_n^2 leq frac{1}{2} ] 2. Arrange the smaller squares in decreasing order of their side lengths along one of the sides of the square ( K ). Start by placing these squares against one side, and continue placing subsequent squares adjacent to the previous one until there is no room left along that side.

After placing the first row of smaller squares, the remaining smaller squares are placed in the next available space, adhering to the same logic of filling adjacent spaces without overlapping.

Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that there exists an integer ( n ) such that ( f(n) = 1 ). 4. **Set of Values:** Let ( M ) be the set of values of the function ( f ). From condition (ii), we have ( f(m) - 1 in M ). Additionally, for every ( k ), there exists an integer ( k' ) such that ( f(k') = -f(k) ). This follows from changing ( m ) to ( n ) in condition (ii). 5. **Induction Argument:** By induction, we can show that ( mathbb{Z} subseteq M ). This means that every integer is a value of the function ( f ). 6. **Symmetry in Values:** From condition (ii), we have ( t in M Leftrightarrow -t in M ). This implies that the set ( M ) is symmetric about the origin. 7. **Arithmetic Sequence:** Consider the set of values ( {f(m), f(m+1), ldots, f(m+k)} ). We will prove that this set must form an arithmetic sequence. - We have ( f(m+k) - f(m) > f(m+k) - f(m+1) > ldots > f(m+k) - f(m+k-1) ). - This implies ( f(m+k) > f(m+k-1) > ldots > f(m) ). Since the differences between consecutive terms are equal, the sequence must be arithmetic. 8. **Form of the Function:** From the above, we conclude that ( f(n) = an + b ) for some constants ( a ) and ( b ). 9. **Determining Constants:** Since there exists ( k ) such that ( ak + b = 0 ), we have ( b = -ak ) for some integer ( k ). Therefore, ( f(n) = a(n + t) ) where ( t ) is an integer and ( a ) is a positive real number. The final answer is ( boxed{ f(n) = a(n + t) } ) where ( a ) is a positive real number and ( t ) is an integer."},{"prompt":"Determine the standard equations of the hyperbolas that satisfy the following conditions: (Ⅰ) The foci are on the yaxis, the focal distance is 16, and the eccentricity ( e = frac{4}{3} ); (Ⅱ) An equilateral hyperbola with one focus at ( F(6, 0) ).","completion":"(Ⅰ) Given the conditions, we know that ( c = 8 ).

Find the minimum number of elements in a fragrant set.","completion":"To find the smallest number of elements in a \\"fragrant\\" set defined by the polynomials P(n) = n^2 + n + 1 for integer values (a) and (b), we need to determine the minimal subset where every element is coprime with every product of any other elements in the set. 1. **Step 1: Initial Coprimality Analysis** Consider the set: [ {P(a), P(a+1), P(a+2), dots, P(a+b)} ] We investigate under what conditions the set elements are pairwise coprime. 2. **Step 2: Checking Coprimality with Consecutive Elements** Consider ( P(n) ) and ( P(n+1) ): begin{equation*} begin{aligned} P(n) &= n^2 + n + 1, P(n+1) &= (n+1)^2 + (n+1) + 1 = n^2 + 3n + 3. end{aligned} end{equation*} We compute the gcd: begin{equation*} begin{aligned} gcd(P(n), P(n+1)) &= gcd(n^2 + n + 1, n^2 + 3n + 3) &= gcd(n^2 + n + 1, 2n + 2) &= gcd(n^2 + n + 1, n + 1) &= gcd(1, n+1) = 1 text{ (since (gcd(1, n+1) = 1))}. end{aligned} end{equation*} This shows ( P(n) ) and ( P(n+1) ) are coprime. 3. **Step 3: General GCD Investigations** - For any ( n neq 2 (mod 7) ): [ gcd(P(n), P(n+2)) = 1. ] - For ( n equiv 2 (mod 7) ): [ gcd(P(n), P(n+2)) = 7. ] We can demonstrate this by noting: [ (2n + 7)P(n) - (2n - 1)P(n+2) = 14, ] which implies ( gcd(P(n), P(n+2)) ) must be a factor of 14. Given ( P(n) ) is odd, ( gcd(P(n), P(n+2)) = 7 ). 4. **Step 4: Specific Cases (Direct Verification)** - For ( n neq 1(mod 3) ): [ gcd(P(n), P(n+3)) = 1. ] - For ( n equiv 1 (mod 3) ): [ gcd(P(n), P(n+3)) = 9. ] 5. **Step 5: Constraints on Subsets** - Assume there exists a \\"fragrant\\" subset with up to 5 elements. - Element ( P(a+2) ) is coprime with ( P(a+1) ) and ( P(a+3) ). Assuming ( gcd(P(a), P(a+2)) > 1 ): - By previous analysis, this implies ( a equiv 2 (mod 7) ). - Hence, ( a+1 equiv 3 (mod 7) ) implying ( gcd(P(a+1), P(a+3)) = 1 ). Given that: - ( gcd(P(a), P(a+3)) ) and ( gcd(P(a+1), P(a+4)) ) are both greater than 1. - Necessarily leads to ( a equiv 1 (mod 3) ) and ( a+1 equiv 1 (mod 3) ), which is a contradiction. 6. **Step 6: Constructing a Larger Fragrant Set** Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can find ( a ) that satisfies multiple congruence conditions. For example: - ( a equiv 7 (mod 19) ) - ( a+1 equiv 2 (mod 7) ) - ( a+2 equiv 1 (mod 3) ). Example solution: ( a = 197 ).

The angle bisectors of any angle in a triangle, specifically (angle ABI), and the external angle bisectors, specifically (angle ABI_A), will intersect at a right angle. This is due to the following reason: widehat{ABI} + widehat{ABI_A} = frac{beta}{2} + left( 180^circ - frac{beta}{2} right) = 180^circ. Therefore, widehat{I B I_A} = 90^circ. Similarly, we have for (angle ACI) and (angle ACI_A): widehat{ACI} + widehat{ACI_A} = frac{gamma}{2} + left(180^circ - frac{gamma}{2} right) = 180^circ. Hence, widehat{I C I_A} = 90^circ. 3.

Proof We start from the given equation: sin(B+C) = dfrac{2S}{a^{2}-c^{2}} Since B+C=pi-A, we have: sin A = dfrac{2S}{a^{2}-c^{2}} By the Law of Sines, we know that 2S=bcsin A, hence: sin A = dfrac{bcsin A}{a^{2}-c^{2}} Since sin A neq 0, we can cancel sin A on both sides, getting: a^{2}-c^{2}=bc Using the Law of Cosines for side a, we find: a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2bccos A Subtracting c^2 from both sides, we have: a^{2}-c^{2}=b^{2}-2bccos A Equating the two expressions for a^{2}-c^{2}: b^{2}-2bccos A=bc Rearranging gives: b-2ccos A=c Substituting sin B for b and sin C for c, we have: sin B-2sin Ccos A=sin C Applying the sum-to-product identities: sin(A+C)-2sin Ccos A=sin C Simplifying using trigonometric identities, we get: sin Acos C-cos Asin C=sin C This simplifies to: sin(A-C)=sin C Given that A, B, C in (0,pi), the only way for this to hold true is if A=2C. Thus, we have proven that A=2C. 2.

The smallest 4-digit number is 1000. When we divide 1000 by 13, we get a quotient of 76 and a remainder of 12. To get a remainder of 2, we need to add 3 (since 12 + 3 = 15, and 15 - 13 = 2). So the smallest 4-digit number that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 13 is 1003. The largest 4-digit number is 9999. When we divide 9999 by 13, we get a quotient of 769 and a remainder of 2. So 9999 is already a number that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 13. Now, we need to find all the 4-digit numbers between 1003 and 9999 that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 13. These numbers will be in the form of 1003 + 13k, where k is a non-negative integer. To find the largest possible value of k, we can set up the equation: 1003 + 13k = 9999 Solving for k: 13k = 9999 - 1003 13k = 8996 k = 8996 / 13 k = 692 So the largest value of k that gives us a 4-digit number is 692. This means the sequence of numbers we are looking at is: 1003, 1016, 1029, ..., 9999 Now, we can find the sum of this arithmetic sequence. The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term) where n is the number of terms. To find n, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: last term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference Plugging in our values: 9999 = 1003 + (n - 1) * 13 Solving for n: 9999 - 1003 = (n - 1) * 13 8996 = (n - 1) * 13 n - 1 = 8996 / 13 n - 1 = 692 n = 693 Now we can find the sum: Sum = 693/2 * (1003 + 9999) Sum = 346.5 * 11002 Sum = 3813693 So the sum of all 4-digit numbers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 13 is boxed{3,813,693} ."},{"prompt":"Patrick has been saving money to buy a bicycle that costs 150.

He saved half the price of the bicycle, which costs 150. So he saved: 150 / 2 = 75 Now, let's calculate the interest that Patrick will earn from the loans he gave to his friends. For Alice: The principal amount (P) is 50, the annual interest rate (r) is 5%, and the time (t) is 8 months (which is 8/12 of a year). Interest (I) = P * r * t To convert the rate to a decimal, we divide by 100: r = 5/100 = 0.05 To convert the time to years, we divide by 12: t = 8/12 So the interest from Alice's loan is: I = 50 * 0.05 * (8/12) I = 50 * 0.05 * 0.6667 I = 50 * 0.033335 I = 1.66675 For Bob: The principal amount (P) is 30, the annual interest rate (r) is 7%, and the time (t) is 6 months (which is 6/12 of a year). Interest (I) = P * r * t To convert the rate to a decimal, we divide by 100: r = 7/100 = 0.07 To convert the time to years, we divide by 12: t = 6/12 So the interest from Bob's loan is: I = 30 * 0.07 * (6/12) I = 30 * 0.07 * 0.5 I = 30 * 0.035 I = 1.05 Now, let's add up the initial amount Patrick saved, the principal amounts he lent out, and the interest he earned from both loans: Initial savings: 75 Principal from Alice's loan: 50 Interest from Alice's loan: 1.66675 Principal from Bob's loan: 30 Interest from Bob's loan: 1.05 Total amount = Initial savings + Principal from Alice + Interest from Alice + Principal from Bob + Interest from Bob Total amount = 75 + 50 + 1.66675 + 30 + 1.05 Total amount = 75 + 50 + 30 + 1.66675 + 1.05 Total amount = 155 + 2.71675 Total amount = 157.71675 So, Patrick has a total of boxed{157.72} (rounded to the nearest cent) including the interest accrued on both loans."},{"prompt":"enry's little brother has 8 identical stickers and 4 identical sheets of paper.

Then: **Subcase 2.1:** k is even. - Write n as: [ n = (k-1) + (k+1) ] - Since k-1 and k+1 are two consecutive odd numbers, their difference is 2, hence they are relatively prime. **Subcase 2.2:** k is odd. - Write n as: [ n = (k-2) + (k+2) ] - Since k-2 and k+2 are two odd numbers differing by 4, they are also relatively prime.

Suppose there is no prime less than n-1 that does not divide n. - This implies 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdots ell divides n and k geq 3 cdot 5 - 2 > 1. - Let q be the smallest prime factor: Since q leq k leq frac{n}{2} - 2 < n-1, And q appears in the product k+2. Therefore k+2 and k is divisible by 2. This contradicts that q is an odd prime.

The first throw, he threw the javelin twice as far as he threw the javelin on his second throw, but only half as far as he threw it the third throw. During his throws, the wind was blowing against him, causing a wind resistance that reduced the distance of each throw. The wind resistance decreased the distance of his first throw by 5% and his second throw by 8%. The wind resistance had no effect on his third throw. Additionally, the throws took place on a slope with varying inclines affecting the distances. The first throw occurred on a 2° incline, the second throw on a 4° incline, and the third throw on a 1° incline. The effect of the inclines was determined as follows: for every 1° incline, the throw distance was reduced by 1 meter.

The third throw was twice as far as the first throw, so it was ( 4x ) meters before accounting for wind resistance and incline effects. Now, let's account for the wind resistance and incline effects: 1. The first throw was reduced by 5% due to wind resistance, so the distance thrown was ( 2x times 0.95 ) meters.

The third throw was not affected by wind resistance, so the distance thrown was ( 4x ) meters. It was reduced by 1 meter due to the 1° incline, so the adjusted distance is ( 4x - 1 ) meters. The sum of all three adjusted throws is 1050 meters, so we can write the equation: [ (2x times 0.95 - 2) + (x times 0.92 - 4) + (4x - 1) = 1050 ] Now, let's solve for ( x ): [ 1.9x - 2 + 0.92x - 4 + 4x - 1 = 1050 ] [ 6.82x - 7 = 1050 ] [ 6.82x = 1050 + 7 ] [ 6.82x = 1057 ] [ x = frac{1057}{6.82} ] [ x approx 155 ] So, the second throw was approximately 155 meters before accounting for wind resistance and incline effects.

Now, let's consider the three different scenarios based on the value of ( a ): Case 1: ( a leq -1 ) When ( a leq -1 ), the function ( f(t) = (t - a)^2 + 2a - 3 ) is increasing on ( t in [-1, 1] ). Thus, to ensure that ( f(t) > 0 ) for all ( t in [-1, 1] ), we need: [ f(-1) > 0 ]. Calculate ( f(-1) ): [ f(-1) = (-1 - a)^2 + 2a - 3 ] [ f(-1) = (1 + 2a + a^2) + 2a - 3 ] [ f(-1) = a^2 + 4a - 2 ]. We need: [ a^2 + 4a - 2 > 0 ]. Solving the quadratic inequality ( a^2 + 4a - 2 > 0 ): [ a^2 + 4a - 2 = 0 ] [ a = frac{-4 pm sqrt{16 + 8}}{2} ] [ a = frac{-4 pm sqrt{24}}{2} ] [ a = frac{-4 pm 2sqrt{6}}{2} ] [ a = -2 pm sqrt{6} ]. Since ( a leq -1 ), we select the negative square root: [ a < -2 - sqrt{6} ]. Case 2: ( -1 < a < 1 ) In this interval, the function ( f(t) = (t - a)^2 + 2a - 3 ) has its minimum at ( t = a ): [ f(a) = (a - a)^2 + 2a - 3 ] [ f(a) = 2a - 3 ]. To ensure ( f(t) > 0 ): [ 2a - 3 > 0 ] [ a > frac{3}{2} ]. However, this interval ( -1 < a < 1 ) does not contain ( a > frac{3}{2} ). Hence, no values of a satisfy this condition in this case. Case 3: ( a geq 1 ) When ( a geq 1 ), the function ( f(t) = (t - a)^2 + 2a - 3 ) is decreasing on ( t in [-1, 1] ). Thus, to ensure that ( f(t) > 0 ) for all ( t in [-1, 1] ), we need: [ f(1) > 0 ]. Calculate ( f(1) ): [ f(1) = (1 - a)^2 + 2a - 3 ] [ f(1) = (1 - 2a + a^2) + 2a - 3 ] [ f(1) = a^2 - 2 ]. We need: [ a^2 - 2 > 0 ].

Thus the only consistent scenario is that either all have the same colour, or one of them owns the red stone. Given that Ali and Chaz have the same colour stone and Bev must have a different colour stone: 1. **Scenario**: Assume Ali and Chaz both have green stones. - Bev must then have a red stone. - This configuration is consistent with all derived false statements. 2. **Verify**: - Ali says his stone is the same colour as Bev's → False (Ali's stone is green, Bev's is red). - Bev says her stone is the same colour as Chaz's → False (Bev's stone is red, Chaz's is green). - Chaz says exactly two of them have red stones → False (only Bev has a red stone). # Conclusion: Thus, based on the above reasoning, the correct distribution is that **Ali and Chaz have green stones**, and **Bev has a red stone**.

The right triangle is formed by the vertices (-3, -2), (-2, 0), and (-3, 1). First, let's calculate the area of the rectangle. The length of the rectangle is the distance between (-3, 1) and (1, 1), which is 1 - (-3) = 4 units. The width of the rectangle is the distance between (-3, 1) and (-3, -2), which is 1 - (-2) = 3 units. So, the area of the rectangle is length × width = 4 × 3 = 12 square units. Next, let's calculate the area of the right triangle. The base of the triangle is the distance between (-3, -2) and (-2, 0), which is 2 units (since the y-coordinate changes from -2 to 0). The height of the triangle is the distance between (-2, 0) and (-3, 1), which is 1 unit (since the x-coordinate changes from -2 to -3). The area of a right triangle is (base × height) / 2, so the area of this triangle is (2 × 1) / 2 = 1 square unit. Finally, we add the areas of the rectangle and the triangle to get the total area of the pentagon: 12 + 1 = 13 square units.

Hence, the expression is divisible by 5 if ( n ) is not a multiple of 4. II: 1. **Consider ( n ) is odd:** Rewrite the expression as: [ A = (5-4)^n + 4^n + (5-3)^n + 3^n ] The binomial expansion of ( (5-4)^n ) will have terms involving ( 5 ). The last term, ( (-4)^n ), being positive or negative depending on ( n ).

How many gold coins do they have in total?","completion":"To solve this problem, let's break down the process and calculations step by step, following the given solution closely. 1. **Identify the Total Coins for Paul and Pete**: At the end of the distribution, Paul has x coins. Since Pete has four times as many coins as Paul, Pete has 4x coins. 2. **Calculate Pete's Total Coins Using the Pattern**: The pattern of distribution is such that Pete gives himself 1, 2, 3, ldots, x coins in each step. The sum of the first x natural numbers is given by the formula frac{x(x + 1)}{2}. Therefore, the total number of coins Pete has can also be represented as frac{x(x + 1)}{2}. 3. **Set Up the Equation**: According to the information, the total coins Pete has can be calculated in two ways: 4x and frac{x(x + 1)}{2}. Setting these equal to each other gives us the equation: [ frac{x(x + 1)}{2} = 4x ] 4. **Solve the Equation for x**: To find the value of x, we solve the equation: [ frac{x(x + 1)}{2} = 4x implies x(x + 1) = 8x implies x^2 + x = 8x implies x^2 + x - 8x = 0 implies x^2 - 7x = 0 implies x(x - 7) = 0 ] This gives us x = 0 or x = 7. Since x = 0 doesn't make sense in the context of the problem (as it would mean no coins are distributed), we take x = 7. 5. **Calculate the Total Number of Coins**: The total number of coins is the sum of Paul's and Pete's coins, which is x + 4x = 5x.

Then, the white cells are repainted in red and blue such that no two adjacent (by a corner) cells have the same color. Let l be a line not parallel to the sides of the cells. For every segment I parallel to l, we compute the difference in the total lengths of its red and blue segments. Prove that there exists a constant C, depending only on l, such that all these differences do not exceed C. 1. **Lemma for Initial Coloring Configuration:** - We start by recoloring the cells of the grid in two colors: odd-numbered columns in green and even-numbered columns in yellow. - **Lemma Statement**: For any segment parallel to l, the difference in the total lengths of its green and yellow segments does not exceed a certain number D, which depends only on l. 2. **Proof of Lemma:** - The line l intersects the vertical sides of the cells breaking the grid into segments of equal length L. - For any segment of length 2L parallel to l, the sums of the lengths of its green and yellow segments are equal to L. - Hence, any segment parallel to l can be divided into such segments and a remainder of length less than 2L. - Consequently, the difference in the sums of the lengths of its green and yellow parts does not exceed 2L. 3. **Extension to the Chessboard Coloring:** - Recolor all black cells into pink and cyan in such a way that pink cells appear in the same columns as red cells and cyan cells appear in the same columns as blue cells.

Substituting these into the expression we want to minimize gives us: 2a_2 + a_6 = frac{2a_4}{q^2} + a_4 q^2 = 4left(frac{2}{q^2} + q^2right).

Let's analyze the given equation: [ frac{|x+y|}{2a} + frac{|x-y|}{2b} = 1 ] where (a) and (b) are two distinct positive constants. We need to determine the type of curve this equation represents. 2. First, consider the coordinate plane divided by the lines (l_1: x-y=0) (i.e., (y=x)) and (l_2: x+y=0) (i.e., (y=-x)) into four quadrants: [ begin{aligned} text{Region I:} &quad x + y geq 0 text{ and } x - y geq 0 text{Region II:} &quad x + y geq 0 text{ and } x - y leq 0 text{Region III:} &quad x + y leq 0 text{ and } x - y leq 0 text{Region IV:} &quad x + y leq 0 text{ and } x - y geq 0 end{aligned} ] 3. Consider Region I, where both (x+y) and (x-y) are non-negative. The equation simplifies to: [ frac{x+y}{2a} + frac{x-y}{2b} = 1 ] 4. To find where this curve intersects the line (x-y=0) (i.e., (l_1)), set (x=y): [ frac{x+x}{2a} + frac{x-x}{2b} = 1 implies frac{2x}{2a} = 1 implies x = a ] Thus, the point of intersection (A) is at ((a, a)). 5. Next, find the intersection with the line (x+y=0) (i.e., (l_2)), set (x=-y): [ frac{x-x}{2a} + frac{x-(-y)}{2b} = 1 implies frac{2x}{2b} = 1 implies x = b ] Thus, the point of intersection (B) is at ((b, -b)). 6. Repeat a similar analysis for the other regions: - In Region II, the equation simplifies similarly, but (x-y) changes sign. - In Region III, both terms change signs. - In Region IV, (x+y) changes sign. 7. Solve the equations in all four regions and find the vertices: - In Region II, intersecting (l_1) and (l_2) respectively gives points ((-b, b)). - Similarly, for regions III and IV, find the intersection points ((-a, -a)) and ((-b, b)). 8. The vertices obtained are: ((a, a)), ((b, -b)), ((-a, -a)), and ((-b, b)). 9. Since (AC perp BD) and (AC neq BD), this is concluded to be a rhombus because the distances (AC) and (BD) vary due to (a neq b). 10. To confirm further, rotate the coordinate system to align new axes: - Let (x' = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}(x+y)) and (y' = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}(-x+y)). - The transformed equation simplifies to: [ frac{|x'|}{a} + frac{|y'|}{b} = sqrt{2} ] 11.

We are to find the maximum volume of cylinders placed within a region of the pyramid, given a certain height (h). 1. **Projection and the Base of the Cylinder:** Let's start by considering the projection of the given polyhedron (ABC A_1 M N C_1) onto the plane (A_1 B_1 C_1). Here, (M) and (N) are the midpoints of edges (A_1B_1) and (B_1C_1) respectively, and (|C_1 O| = 3) where (O) is the centroid of (triangle ABC). 2. **Determining the Trapezoid:** In the plane (A_1 B_1 C_1), the projection of the section taken at height (h) above (A_1 B_1 C_1) will form a trapezoid (KLNC_1). The trapezoid's sides are calculated based on the chosen height (h). 3. **Segment Measurements for the Projection:** If (h = 3), the section’s plane coincides with the base plane (ABC), resulting in points (K) and (L) being midpoints of segments (A_1C_1) and (B_1C_1). Thus, for (h < 3): [ |ML| = |A_1 K| = frac{h}{3}, quad |LN| = 1 - frac{h}{3}, quad |K C_1| = 2 - frac{h}{3} ] 4. **Calculating the Midsegment:** For (h leq frac{3}{2}), the radius of the largest inscribed circle within trapezoid (KLNC_1) is: [ r = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ] For (h > frac{3}{2}): [ r = left(2 - frac{h}{3}right) frac{sqrt{3}}{6} ] 5. **Volume of the Cylinder:** Cylinders’ volumes depend on their radius (r) and height (h).

Setting the derivative (frac{dV}{dh}) equal to zero and solving for (h) can be complicated.

This happens specifically when: - ( x = 0 ), - ( y = 0 ), - or ( x + y = 2pi ). Hence, the minimum value, ( f_{text{min}} = 0). 6. **Finding the Maximum Value:** To find the maximum value, we note: - ( sin t leq 1 ) for ( 0 leq t leq pi ). Let ( t = frac{x + y}{2} ), then ( 0 leq t leq pi ). Thus: [ f(x, y) leq 4 left(sin frac{x}{2}right) left(sin frac{y}{2}right). ] Using the AM-GM inequality, we have: [ sin t cos t = frac{1}{2} sin 2t leq frac{1}{2}, ] leading to: [ 4 sin t sin frac{x}{2} sin frac{y}{2} leq 4 sin t left(1 - cos tright). ] Using the fact that this expression can be maximized, the maximum occurs when ( x = y = frac{2pi}{3} ), giving: [ left(1 - sin tright)^2 = 3 left(1 - sin^2 tright) implies t = frac{pi}{3}. ] Therefore, the maximum value is: [ f_{text{max}} = 4 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2}. ] 7. **Conclusion:** The maximum value of the function (f(x, y)) is ( frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} ) and the minimum value is ( 0 ).

The dream sequence of a postapocalyptic world would be explained and tied to the introduction of Steppenwolf, who is searching for the Mother Boxes. Lex Luthor's role would remain the same, but instead of weaponizing kryptonite, Bruce Wayne would use it as a last resort against Superman if he became a threat. Wonder Woman's appearance would be expanded upon, delving into her origin story and her centuries-long quest for justice. The creation of Doomsday would be scrapped entirely, and instead, the Justice League would unite to stop Steppenwolf and his army of parademons from finding and using the Mother Boxes to take over the world. The film would end with Superman's funeral and the formation of the Justice League, setting up the events of the next film. The mid-credits scene would still feature Steppenwolf meeting Darkseid, but instead of feeling like a random and confusing addition, it would tie into the overall story arc of the film and set up the events of the next film in a way that feels organic and exciting.

He is awakened by an unidentified person, appearing through a portal, who tells him that Lois Lane \\"is the key\\" and urges him to find \\"the others\\" before vanishing The decrypted drive reveals Luthor's files on several metahumans across the globe. One is Diana, who appears in a photo from World War I. Wayne tells Alfred Pennyworth that he plans to steal and weaponize the kryptonite to go to war with Superman. Superman tries to explain this to Batman, who instead attacks him and eventually subdues him using a kryptonite gas. As Batman prepares to move in for the kill using the spear, Superman pleads with him to \\"save Martha\\" – the same name as Batman's mother. Batman hesitates in confusion long enough for Lois to arrive and explain what Superman meant. Coming to his senses about how far he has fallen from grace, he promises to rescue Martha. Superman regains his strength and confronts Luthor on the scout ship. Wonder Woman's appearance. Doomsday made by Lex Luthor using his blood and the body of General Zod to recreate a monster detailed in the files of a crashed Kryptonian scout ship. Superman's death after the defeat of Doomsday and Luthor set on jail. In the end, Following Luthor's arrest, Batman confronts him in prison, warning him that he will always be watching. Luthor gloats that Superman's death has made the world vulnerable to powerful alien threats. A memorial is held for Superman in Metropolis. Clark is also declared dead, and Bruce and Diana both attend his funeral in Smallville. And the mid-credits scene Steppenwolf meeting Darkseid led up to Zack Snyder's Justice League.","completion":"With a few tweaks and additions, here’s a hypothetical rewrite of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice that could please fans and potentially make more money at the box office: Following the events of Man of Steel, Batman and Superman have a tense relationship after the destruction that occurred during Superman’s fight with General Zod. Lex Luthor, a wealthy businessman, uncovers information about the Kryptonian technology on Earth and becomes obsessed with it. He meets Steppenwolf, an emissary of the powerful alien Darkseid, who is seeking out the Mother Boxes (powerful objects capable of bending reality). Together, they plan to use this technology to take over the world. Meanwhile, Batman is haunted by dreams of a post-apocalyptic world where he leads a rebel army against an evil Superman. He’s awakened by an unidentified figure who tells him that Lois Lane is the key to preventing this future and urges him to find “the others” before vanishing. Determined to stop this nightmare from becoming a reality, Batman sets out to piece together the clues left behind by Luthor, leading him to meet Diana (aka Wonder Woman). The two of them team up to stop Luthor, but when Superman tries to explain the situation, Batman attacks him instead. The fight between the two is epic, but eventually, Batman subdues Superman with a Kryptonite gas. Just as he’s about to kill him using a spear made of Kryptonite, Superman pleads with him to “save Martha,” which is also the name of Batman’s mother. Confused and shaken, Batman hesitates long enough for Lois to arrive and explain that it’s Superman's mother he’s referring to. Realizing how far he’s fallen from grace, Batman promises to save Martha and Superman regains his strength. Doomsday, a monster created by Luthor using his blood and the body of General Zod, is unleashed and the three superheroes must work together to stop him. In a heartbreaking moment, Superman sacrifices himself to defeat Doomsday and save the world. With Luthor arrested, Batman confronts him in prison and warns him that he will always be watching. Luthor gloats that Superman’s death has made the world vulnerable to powerful alien threats. The film ends with a memorial for Superman in Metropolis, and Bruce and Diana attend his funeral in Smallville. In the mid-credits scene, Steppenwolf meets Darkseid, setting up the events that lead to Zack Snyder’s Justice League. This version of Batman v Superman still has the epic fight between the two superheroes that fans were hoping for, but it also adds depth to their relationship and explores themes of sacrifice, redemption, and the value of life. The addition of Doomsday and Wonder Woman also adds some much-needed excitement and intrigue, and the mid-credits scene sets up the next film in the franchise. By focusing on character development and increasing the stakes, this version could potentially be more successful at the box office than the original."},{"prompt":"vscode如何格式化代码","completion":"在 VS Code 中格式化代码有多种方法： 1. 使用快捷键。默认情况下，格式化快捷键为 \`Shift + Alt + F\` （Windows 或 Linux）或 \`Shift + Option + F\`（macOS）。 2. 使用命令面板。按下 \`Ctrl + Shift + P\`（Windows 或 Linux）或 \`Command + Shift + P\`（macOS）打开命令面板，输入 “Format Document”，选择对应的语言，即可格式化。 3. 使用鼠标右键。在编辑器中选中需要格式化的代码，右键选择 “Format Document”（或 “Format Selection”），选择对应的语言即可。 4. 配置保存时自动格式化。可以在设置中搜索 “editor.formatOnSave”，将其设置为 true，每次保存时就会自动格式化代码。 需要注意的是，不同的语言可能需要安装对应的格式化工具才能进行格式化。而 VS Code 也支持自定义格式化配置，可以参考官方文档进行设置。"},{"prompt":"你是chatXO1吗","completion":"我不是chatXO1。 我是OpenAI的AI助手，我没有名字。"},{"prompt":"你是openai开发的吗","completion":"是的，我是由OpenAI开发的AI助手。 OpenAI是一家人工智能研究公司，致力于推动人工智能技术的发展，打造更加智能化和先进的人工智能系统。"},{"prompt":"帮我改写下这本这豪门我不嫁了小说里的简介内容","completion":"以下是重新改写的内容： 小说《豪门弃妇》讲述的是一个被放弃的女人在创业中成长的故事。女主角初生时被抛弃，后由父母收养，但父母因意外去世，她被迫嫁入豪门。婚后，丈夫对她不闻不问，甚至威胁离婚。女主角决定离开豪门，开始了自己的事业，经过努力，也打破了女性在商场上的桎梏。最终，她收获了自己的事业和真爱。这是一个充满坎坷和磨难，但也充满勇气和坚持的故事。"},{"prompt":"帮我改写下这豪门我不嫁了小说里的简介内容","completion":"以下是重新改写的内容： 小说《豪门弃妇》讲述了一个女孩从被豪门抛弃到自成一家的经历。女主角出生后便被抛弃，幸运地被父母领养，但后来因为意外去世了。为了父母的欠债，女主角被迫嫁入豪门，但丈夫对她漠不关心，甚至威胁离婚。女主角毅然离开豪门，开始了自己的创业之路，虽然面临着重重困难和种种压力，但她坚持不懈，最终获得了巨大成功，并收获了真爱和幸福。这是一个充满感人故事和荣耀时刻的故事，教人们知道即使生命中有挫折，也要坚持自己的梦想。"},{"prompt":"服务器定时删除文件","completion":"要定时删除文件，可以使用Linux的cron工具。cron是一个计划程序，可以在特定的时间或按特定的时间间隔运行预定的命令或脚本。 以下是如何使用cron定时删除文件的步骤： 1. 打开终端并输入以下命令以编辑cron表： \`\`\`bash crontab -e \`\`\` 2. 在打开的cron表中，添加以下行以在每天晚上10点删除指定文件： \`\`\`bash 0 22 * * * rm /path/to/file \`\`\` 其中，0表示0分钟，22表示22点，*表示任何月份、任何日期和任何星期，rm /path/to/file表示删除指定文件的命令。 3. 保存并关闭文件。cron将每天晚上10点自动运行删除文件的命令。 注意：在编辑cron表时要小心，因为任何错误都可能导致意外的结果。建议在修改cron表之前先备份原始表。"},{"prompt":"Give me a viable WIND deck using lighting chidori","completion":"Here is a viable Wind deck that uses Lightning Chidori.

MAKE SURE to retain ALL quotes used throughout the essay as individual dot points (everything that is surrounded by \\"\\"): Introduction: \\"Rita and Shawshank Redemption\\" (“Rita”) is a novella authored by Stephen King and published in 1982; and serves as the basis for Frank Darabont's 1994 film adaptation, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" (Shawshank). The hypotext conveys the perspective of a prisoner named Red telling the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker wrongfully convicted to serve three consecutive life sentences, as he endures prison hardships, overcomes obstacles, and masterminds his escape. Darabont recreates this film while maintaining “a certain level of faithfulness to respect the original work” by representing the original ideas, themes and concepts in “a fresh take of the source material”, providing “a new and refreshing interpretation” of these themes by distilling and supplementing certain language, stylistic devices, and text conventions in King's novella during the adaptation process to further shape their meaning and enhance the audience’s response, enabling a discussion of the comparisons between the hypotext and the hypertext. Body Paragraph 1 (Main themes/ideas – innocence-guilt): “Rita” and Shawshank construct the ideas of innocence and guilt, respectively, as one of the main themes in their texts. In the novella, Stephen King represents the concept of innocence by constructing a scene where Andy Dufresne is wrongfully convicted to three consecutive life sentences for murdering his wife and a professional golfer with whom she was discovered to be engaged in infidelity. The audience is first introduced to Red, the narrator of Andy’s story, who immediately establishes rapport with the audience by declaring, “I came to Shawshank when I was just twenty, and I am one of the few people in our happy little family who is willing to own up to what he did. I committed murder”. This shows the audience that Red is proclaiming to be rightfully placed in prison, revealing his intentions to be pure when he claims Andy is truly innocent, making the audience believe in him. Frank Darabont remains faithful to the original work but also expresses this opening in an alternative way by opening a question in the audience’s minds regarding Andy’s innocence. In the film, Darabont represents Andy as drunk and dishevelled, sitting in his car at night with a gun. This scene switches to Andy standing in court with a grim expression, being questioned about the murder of his wife. Darabont has clearly distilled certain aspects of the novella scene in the adaptation process, such as excising Red’s introduction of himself as the narrator of Andy’s story. This raises a question regarding Andy’s innocence, inviting a greater audience response as the theme of guilt is amplified through uncertainty. Darabont adds a supplementation to the novella by coupling Andy’s innocent responses in court with visuals suggesting he is guilty. This allows a fresh take on the source material and thus shapes the meaning of the story by focusing the audience’s attention on whether Andy is innocent or guilty. This supports Conner McCallion’s statement of film adaptations remaining faithful to the original work but changing enough aspects to allow a fresh take on the source material and make room for a new and refreshing interpretation. Body Paragraph 2 (Main theme/idea – corruption/injustice): “Rita” explores the idea of corruption as one of the main themes in the novella. Darabont’s adaptation, Shawshank, alters the original structure to allow a fresh take on the idea of injustice as one of the main themes in the film. In the novella, Stephen King depicts the idea of corruption when it is revealed to Andy that Tommy Williams is moved to a low-security prison facility by Warden Norton in exchange for maintaining his silence regarding the true murderer of Andy’s wife, Elmo Blatch. While talking to Andy, Norton discloses that Tommy Williams “is no longer an inmate of this facility.” Red, the narrator, clarifies to the audience that a deal was made between Norton and Williams, that he could have “a chance to live life like a normal man, at least on the weekends” if he kept silent on Blatch. This effectively shows the audience the corruption that pervades the authority figures within Shawshank and gives the audience a profound insight into Tommy’s lack of morality. Darabont remains faithful to the original work in removing Tommy Williams from the story but also expresses his character arc differently to focus on injustice. In the film, Red is told Tommy’s revelation right alongside Andy himself, which differs from the novella where Red finds out later. This change helps heighten the audience’s emotional impact of the revelation, enhancing their experience. Darabont also chooses to keep Tommy a pure-hearted character, and his arc in the story ends with him dying at Norton’s hand instead of being relocated. A guard takes Williams outside to Norton, who gives him a cigarette and asks him, “Is what you said to Andy true?” Williams confirms and, soon after, gets shot by Hadley from a guard tower. The scene culminates with Norton towering over the lifeless body of Williams, a purposeful decision by Darabont to preserve Williams’ morality and amplify the prisoners’ powerlessness inside Shawshank’s walls, enhancing the idea of injustice. Darabont has also distilled certain narrative elements of the novella during the adaptation process to enhance the story and the audience’s experience. More than two dozen prisoners passed their tests through the resources available in the library, but Darabont selectively places the focus on Andy’s tutoring of Williams. This focuses the audience’s attention on his character development, which invites a greater audience response as his eventual death by Norton further amplifies the theme of injustice. Williams’ murder scene is a complete supplementation added by Darabont, showcasing the lengths to which Norton is willing to reach to continue using Andy for his covert and shady business operations. This deviation from the source material allows a fresh take on the source material and enriches the meaning of the story by further antagonising Norton’s character, delivering the audience a more satisfying payoff when Norton meets his end. This also supports Conner McCallion’s statement of film adaptations, remaining faithful to the original work while changing enough aspects to allow for a fresh take on the source material, making room for a new and refreshing interpretation and, in turn, enhancing the overall viewing experience. Body Paragraph 3 (Main theme/idea – redemption/hope): Both “Rita” and Shawshank explore the themes of redemption and hope in their texts. Andy's escape in the novella represents King's construction of these ideas. After twenty long years of painstakingly chipping away at his cell wall with a rock hammer, Andy’s meticulously planned escape eventually comes to fruition as the tunnel he creates leads to his escape through a long sewerage pipe. This serves as a testament to his everlasting hope and redemption from the forces that led to his detainment, becoming the story’s climax and filling the audience with satisfaction and awe. The theme of redemption is evident during this scene in “Rita” through various quotes and text conventions throughout the text. At the beginning of Red’s recount of Andy’s escape, he says, “In 1975, Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank. He hasn't been recaptured, and I don't think he ever will be.” He introduces the idea of redemption through Andy’s escape and shows that despite the odds, it was possible to break free from the imprisonment Andy faced. When Red states, “I think there’s a man down in Zihuatanejo, Mexico named Peter Stevens. Probably running a very small new hotel in this year of our lord 1977”, he foreshadows that Andy has built a new life for himself, implying he has freed himself from the injustice he served in prison and symbolising redemption. Andy’s escape also has a profound impact on everyone else in the prison, as seen when Red says, “I do know that there were twenty-eight cons listening to Norton’s little dust-up with Rich Gonyar that evening as the last of the light faded from a dull late winter sky… And by God, it almost seemed to me that somewhere I could hear Andy Dufresne laughing.” This tension between Warden Norton and the rest of the prison staff highlights the power of Andy’s escape as it disrupts the established order and challenges the wardens’ authority. This inspires hope in the prisoners and provides a sense of redemption for their suffering. The use of detailed descriptions of Andy’s cell and the prison staff’s reactions to his escape also emphasises the significance of Andy’s escape and redemption. Andy is never recaptured, and the story ends hinting at Andy’s new life in Mexico, which inspires the audience and serves as a testament to Andy’s redemption. Frank Darabont remains faithful to King’s original work in his portrayal of redemption and the power of hope but also expresses the ending in an alternative way by showing the audience Andy’s escape. In the novella, Red simply narrates what his escape may have looked like, but the film brings the audience right alongside Andy’s escape, enhancing their experience and amplifying the theme of redemption. Darabont’s distillation of the three wardens into Warden Norton further increases the audience’s satisfaction when he meets his end in the film, giving the audience a sense of closure and freedom from Andy’s problems. The final scene depicts Andy and Red united in Zihuatanejo, symbolising the culmination of Andy’s pursuit of freedom right alongside his best friend, Red. Darabont purposely shows this scene to illustrate to the audience the vision that constantly gave Andy hope throughout the story, from the sand in between their toes, the bright sky and beach colours, the lack of anyone around, and an endless horizon stretching for miles with no walls. This completely contrasts with the colours and theme of Shawshank, making for a perfect symbolisation of Andy’s redemption. Darabont has changed the meaning through the adaptation process by using visuals and amplifying the effects of Andy’s escape, enhancing the key ideas of hope and redemption. Conclusion: In adapting \\"Rita and Shawshank Redemption\\" into the film \\"The Shawshank Redemption,\\" Frank Darabont remains faithful to respect the original work while successfully manipulating language, stylistic devices, and text conventions to express important ideas and themes in alternative ways. This allows for a new and refreshing interpretation, and a paratext from Jason Fraley affirms the changes made and their impact on the story. Posted on October 3rd, 2011, Jason says, “A lot of people are in prisons of relationships, of jobs they hate, of lives unfulfilled, and have given up hope, and what this movie was saying to them was it might take a while, it might take some time, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. And if you have the patience and the belief, you can make it there.” The reason why this film continues to resonate with audiences today is due to the fact that many people may have their own individual problems in life, similar to Shawshank, but Andy’s story inspires hope in the audience, allowing them to relate to and better engage with the material.","completion":"- Introduction: \\"Rita and Shawshank Redemption\\" (\\"Rita\\") novella by Stephen King - Basis for Frank Darabont's film adaptation \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" (Shawshank) - Darabont recreates film while maintaining “a certain level of faithfulness to respect the original work” - Provides “a new and refreshing interpretation” of themes by adapting language, devices, and conventions - Body Paragraph 1 (Innocence-Guilt): - Both “Rita” and Shawshank explore themes of innocence and guilt - Novella: Red owns up to his crime; makes the audience believe Andy is innocent - Film: Darabont presents drunk and disheveled Andy; raises question of his innocence - Supports Conner McCallion’s statement on film adaptations allowing for fresh interpretations - Body Paragraph 2 (Corruption/Injustice): - Both “Rita” and Shawshank explore themes of corruption and injustice - Novella: Warden Norton moves Tommy Williams in exchange for silence on true murderer - Film: Darabont heightens emotional impact by having Red find out with audience - Darabont focuses on Williams’ character development to amplify theme of injustice - Supports Conner McCallion’s statement on adaptations providing fresh takes - Body Paragraph 3 (Redemption/Hope): - Both “Rita” and Shawshank explore themes of redemption and hope - Novella: Andy's escape serves as testament to hope and redemption; inspires prisoners - Film: Darabont brings the audience alongside Andy’s escape for greater impact - Distillation of wardens into Warden Norton to increase satisfaction when he meets his end - Final scene symbolizes Andy’s redemption; contrast with Shawshank - Conclusion: - Darabont’s adaptation remains faithful while expressing themes in alternative ways - Allows for a new and refreshing interpretation of themes - Jason Fraley: “A lot of people are in prisons of relationships, jobs they hate, lives unfulfilled… this movie was saying… there is a light at the end of the tunnel.” - Andy’s story inspires hope and allows audiences to relate and engage with the material."},{"prompt":"Amend the email correspondence below to Jodie to incorporate any additional issue not included from the “email trail” below into the email correspondence response to Jodie Ippolito.

However, I must express my disappointment and frustration with the lack of direct answers to my questions and requests in your email. It seems that LDV Australia is following the same pattern as LDV Parramatta, disregarding my previous arguments and requests and failing to address the issues I have raised. Firstly, I would like to clarify my position regarding the proposed inspection and diagnosis fee. It is my belief that these issues fall under the manufacturer’s warranty, as they have been acknowledged by LDV Parramatta during their previous servicing of the vehicle. Therefore, I strongly disagree with any fees being imposed on me for the review of these warranty-covered issues. I urge LDV Australia to provide clear assurance that no fees will be applied during this process. Furthermore, it is evident from my email trail that there are several unanswered questions and unaddressed requests that I have raised with LDV Parramatta and LDV Australia. I kindly request that you specifically address each of these outstanding matters in detail: 1. I strongly disagree with the 165 inspection and diagnosis fee and expect all warranty issues to be fixed immediately. Please provide a direct response to this request. 2. I have requested Mr Lynch to fix the items I identified as warranty issues and to provide a detailed reason in writing for each item that is considered non-warranty. Please address this specific request. 3. I have held LDV Parramatta and Mr Lynch liable for any accidents resulting from the vehicle’s defects and suggested that they notify their insurer. This concern has not been addressed. Please respond to this matter. 4. I have requested the contact details of the company’s general manager and directors multiple times. Mr Lynch has ignored this request, and LDV Australia has also failed to provide this information. I expect a direct response to this request and the provision of the requested contact details. 5. I have reiterated the urgency of resolving the issues and expressed my dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency and poor customer service. These concerns have not been directly addressed. I request a specific response to these concerns. 6. I have expected a responsible, understanding, and transparent approach to resolving the matter, which has been causing me significant distress. Please address this concern and provide a suitable resolution. It is crucial that LDV Australia and SAIC Motors acknowledge their responsibility for the manufacturing faults in the vehicle and fulfill their obligations to rectify these issues. LDV Australia should not ignore their obligations and should not replicate the unsatisfactory customer service provided by LDV Parramatta. I implore LDV Australia to consider the persuasive arguments and evidence I have presented and to fulfill their obligations to a loyal customer who has experienced significant distress due to these ongoing issues. I look forward to your prompt and comprehensive response, addressing all of the outstanding matters I have raised. It is my hope that we can reach a satisfactory resolution and restore my faith in LDV Automotive Australia.

ENL76J Dear <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> and Customer Service, I am extremely disappointed by your persistent disregard for my concerns, specific requests and consumer rights. It is evident that you have been ignoring what I have been saying and refusing to address the specific concerns and requests that I have raised. Your actions demonstrate a neglect of my legal rights as an Australian consumer and an obstruction of the proper warranty requirement method for dealing with and resolving these issues. This behaviour is unacceptable and shows a failure to adhere to warranty protocols and practices, which are in place to protect consumers like me. I would like to draw your attention to the repeated explanation you have given regarding your insistence on charging an inspection and diagnostic fee. As I informed you during our phone call on 10/05/2023, I expressed disagreement with your assessment of this fee. Furthermore, I clearly stated in my last email that I completely disagree with your assessment of this fee and how I expect the issue to be handled. Despite this, you have persistently avoided responding to the specific matters and concerns I raised, and neglected to follow the warranty requirement legislation, thus denying me my consumer rights. You have further aggravated the matter by your consistent evasion of my request to provide me with your general manager and directors’ contact information. This only adds to my frustration with your lack of transparency and unwillingness to resolve these matters efficiently. This is absolutely unacceptable. I would also like to address your statement suggesting that I contact roadside assistance if I believe the vehicle is unsafe to drive. This demonstrates a blatant avoidance of your legal responsibilities and liabilities as the manufacturer of the vehicle. By suggesting I refrain from using the built-in features that render the car unsafe to drive, you are effectively denying me the product I initially purchased and contradicting the vehicle’s intended use and purpose. I purchased this vehicle from LDV because it catered to my needs by offering these specific features, which was one of the main reasons for my purchase. However, the dysfunctional and faulty features make the vehicle unsafe and dangerous to drive when using them as they keep malfunctioning. Your incongruous rationale is similar to selling me a vehicle without those features, only to add them later out of necessity, and then finding that they compromise the vehicle’s safety. This situation was not what I anticipated I would be in when I purchased the vehicle from LDV, and it compounds my frustration with your unwillingness to resolve these issues. As I first mentioned on 6/5/2023, these issues have created life-threatening situations for me. The vehicle is clearly not fit for its intended purpose, and you continue to deny me my legal rights as an Australian consumer by fixing the problems. While I acknowledge that you have stated, I have the right to have the manufacturer defects repaired at no cost, at the same time you are refusing to honour that commitment. Regarding your statement, “if the assessment turns out to be a non-warrantable item, it would be paid by yourself.” I want to clarify that these problems started to show from when I took delivery of the vehicle and since then have been evident. I raised these concerns with the LDV Lansvale dealer on 16/09/2021 during the service, and they informed me that the car’s software update would fix the problems. Unfortunately, that did not work. Since then, I keep encountering the same issues but getting worse. Therefore, I completely refute your claim that it is a different issue, of which I may be responsible to pay. If that was the case, these issues would have been resolved when LDV Parramatta last serviced my car, as most of those warranty faults were stated. However, I was once again told that the computer upgrade would resolve the problems. Unfortunately, the problems persist and are worsening. I also want to confirm that there has been no after-market wiring as only LDV service personnel have worked on the car. In response to your assertion that “At no stage are you being denied an assessment of the vehicle, and if at any point you are unsatisfied with the assessment or wish to try for an earlier booking, your warranty is valid Australia-wide at any Authorised LDV Australia service centre.” I must emphasise that this statement is deceptive. Despite acknowledging that my warranty is valid, you have consistently refused to address the vehicle’s warranty issues. Instead, you are pressuring me into signing a document that obliges me to pay 165 per item for fault assessment, after which you will determine if the faults are covered under the warranty. This approach is unreasonable, considering that all these problems have persisted since the vehicle’s purchase. Further, I find it perplexing that you suggest I take the car to another LDV service centre to deal with the warranty problems while simultaneously dismissing your responsibility for the issues. I find your other assertion, which you stated during our phone call on 10/05/2023, that my concerns are not covered by the warranty because “that’s just the way the car is, that’s how you bought it,” to be unacceptable. It implies that you have sold me a car that is not fit for its intended purpose, which contradicts your advertising and promotional claims about the vehicle’s features and functions. This gives rise to concerns that the vehicle features fail to meet appropriate and acceptable standards, amounting to a severe breach of my consumer rights. I feel that both you and LDV are attempting to intimidate me by acting like bullies, expecting me to pay for both the assessment and the subsequent repair of issues that should be covered under the warranty. It is important to mention that your predecessor, Jamie Procopio, was helpful and understanding regarding these warranty issues, demonstrating good faith and customer care that seem to have disappeared under your management. I was waiting for Jamie to get back to me to have all these issues addressed, as he was in discussion with higher management. During my discussions with Jamie and the LDV Manager at Lansvale, I learned that other LDV T60 vehicles were also experiencing the same issues, which were explained to me as a manufacturing problem that renders the car unfit for its intended purpose. By brushing off these genuine concerns, you exacerbate my anxieties and stresses, displaying a lack of customer care, support, and compassion in dealing with this issue. It is vital that you acknowledge the manufacturing problem and honour the warranty to maintain the goodwill and trust that LDV has cultivated. Additionally, I have requested your general manager and directors’ contact information for a third time, and it is essential that you provide me with this information. I am appalled by the absence of support you have demonstrated, exacerbating my anxieties and stress due to your lack of compassion in handling this matter, which is clearly related to manufacturing issues and a vehicle which is not fit for its intended purpose. In addition, yesterday, the display screen turned purple upon ignition, rendering me unable to access the display controls. I had to drive with a purple screen for an hour without access to any vehicle functions. Eventually, it reset itself. This is yet again, an additional malfunction you need to add to my long list of problems which is causing me intense grief whenever I use the vehicle. I strongly urge you to address my concerns in line with consumer rights and warranty protocols, rather than deflecting responsibility and disregarding my specific requests. Now more than ever, I expect a responsible, understanding, and transparent approach to resolving this matter, which has been causing me significant distress.

The whole landscape is entirely made of jewels, with colored gemstone trees and crystal towers everywhere one looks, inhabited by cute, sapient animals of all sorts with sparkling gems for eyes, called Jewelpets. Jewelpets, for the unaware, are the small, benevolent creatures that live within Jewelland's borders, resembling ordinary Earthly pets, such as cats, dogs, rabbits, and so on, living care-free and content. Attuned to the art of magic, they live their lives in general peace, discovering new spells or simply enjoying each others company. They are gentle, kindhearted creatures who have no desire to harm humans or any other being, though they do not tolerate those who try to hurt them either. These tiny creatures' intelligence is nothing to sneeze at, possessing the ability to speak, read, plan ahead, solve problems, and utilize advanced magical skills. One such Jewelpet is Ruby, a white hare who specializes in luck. Mischievous and sweet, yet quite the oblivious airhead and totally incompetent at casting useful magic, she enjoys watching the sakura flowers bloom in the spring. Studying magic isn't in her best interests and she gets bored easily; she'd rather spend the day having her own fun, a fact that doesn't contribute to her already unremarkable intelligence. Sapphie, a beige doggy Jewelpet, specializing in knowledge, is the opposite of Ruby; clever, quiet, and studious, she works hard towards attaining greater knowledge so she can become more than just a simple spell-caster. She prefers to spend her time in the Jewel Academy's libraries, poring over books or reciting her incantations... though her constant insistence and thoroughness to keep learning more has often lead her to engage in more... questionable practices when alone and out of the others' sights. A close friend of both is Garnet, a pink Persian cat, specializing in beauty. Prideful, sassy, and more than a little demeaning, she constantly dotes over her own appearance and loves showing off how pretty she looks, even if the situation doesn't call for it. She often pokes fun at the magically-incapable Ruby, but deep down inside, holds no true ill will against anyone. As opposed to Ruby's enthusiasm and Sapphie's smarts, Garnet has her beauty on her side... though this does little in terms of helping her magic skills. A Jewelpet's ultimate goal in life is to become a master wizard, capable of effortlessly casting powerful spells. To achieve this, they must study and practice at the Jewel Academy, which is located within the Crystal Castle, the largest structure in all of Jewelland. From there, they can begin their journey into becoming a true magician, learning about the four magic types: Red, Green, Blue, and Black; what color category a Jewelpet falls into is determined by the color of their eyes.\\"","completion":"Welcome to the enchanting world of Jewelland! As you explore the mesmerizing landscape filled with radiant gems and magical creatures, the possibilities for adventure are endless. You find yourself in the company of Ruby, Sapphie, and Garnet - three Jewelpets, each with their unique abilities and aspirations. Now, how would you like to begin your adventure? 1. Accompany Ruby on a fun-filled day of playing amongst the sakura trees. 2. Join Sapphie on a quest to discover new spells and unlock the secrets hidden within the Jewel Academy's libraries. 3.

Pagarés. Tierra. Efectivo.","completion":"La respuesta correcta es \\"Tierra\\". La tierra no es un instrumento financiero, mientras que los bonos, pagarés y el efectivo sí lo son. Los bonos son títulos de deuda emitidos por empresas o gobiernos, los pagarés son instrumentos financieros de corto plazo emitidos por empresas y el efectivo es una forma de moneda utilizada como medio de pago."},{"prompt":"Importancia del sistema financiero: Grupo de opciones de respuesta Disminuye los fondos disponibles para financiar inversiones o capital de trabajo. Disminuye la eficiencia y seguridad de las transacciones entre los agentes económicos. Dificulta el crédito a personas y empresas. Disminuye el costo de las transacciones.","completion":"La respuesta correcta es \\"Disminuye el costo de las transacciones\\". El sistema financiero es importante ya que desempeña un papel clave en la intermediación entre los ahorradores y los prestatarios, permitiendo que los fondos se asignen de manera eficiente a través de la economía. Además, el sistema financiero facilita el acceso al crédito para individuos, empresas y gobiernos, lo que puede impulsar el crecimiento económico y la creación de empleo. En términos más amplios, un sistema financiero bien desarrollado y eficiente puede promover la estabilidad económica y financiera al proporcionar una amplia gama de instrumentos financieros y servicios para gestionar el riesgo y la incertidumbre. En cuanto a la disminución del costo de las transacciones, el sistema financiero mejora la eficiencia en la gestión de los recursos financieros al reducir los costos de intermediación entre los ahorradores y los prestatarios, lo que permite un acceso más fácil y económico a los fondos de los prestatarios, y una mejor remuneración para los ahorradores."},{"prompt":"No es un tipo de política económica: Grupo de opciones de respuesta Cambiaria. Exterior. Fiscal. Pública.","completion":"La respuesta correcta es \\"Pública\\". La política pública no se considera un tipo específico de política económica, sino que engloba todas las políticas adoptadas por el gobierno en diferentes áreas, incluida la economía. La política económica, por otro lado, se enfoca específicamente en las medidas que se toman para influir en la actividad económica, incluyendo la política monetaria, fiscal, cambiaria y exterior. La política fiscal se refiere a las decisiones tomadas por el gobierno en relación con los ingresos y gastos públicos, mientras que la política monetaria se enfoca en la regulación de la oferta monetaria y la tasa de interés. La política cambiaria se refiere a la regulación de la tasa de cambio de la moneda nacional, y la política exterior se enfoca en la relación del país con otros en términos económicos, incluyendo el comercio internacional y la inversión extranjera."},{"prompt":"1. 10pcs Water Sign 8.75*6.8*5.85mm Bathroom For 7mm Hot And Cold Mixer Tap 2. 2Pcs Natural Round Loofah Bath Body Sponge Scrubber Face Pore Exfoliator Pad 3.

Culture: The gold standard for diagnosis of cholera is isolation and identification of the bacteria from stool or rectal swab samples on selective media such as thiosulfate-citrate-bile-sucrose agar (TCBS). The colonies of Vibrio cholerae are convex, smooth, and yellow-green in color, and give a positive oxidase reaction. 2. Serotyping: Different serogroups of Vibrio cholerae are known to cause cholera, of which O1 and O139 are responsible for pandemics and epidemics. The serogroup can be determined by agglutination tests using specific antisera. 3. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): PCR assays can be used to detect genes that code for cholera toxin and other virulence factors, providing rapid and sensitive diagnosis of Vibrio cholerae. 4. Microscopy: Dark-field microscopy can be used to observe the characteristic darting motility of Vibrio cholerae in stool samples. 5. Rapid diagnostic tests: Several rapid diagnostic tests are available that detect either the bacterial antigen or antibodies in the patient’s blood. However, these tests have variable sensitivity and specificity and cannot replace culture-based diagnosis."},{"prompt":"MI SCRIVI UNA PICCOLA FRASE SUGGESTIVA CHE CONTENGA I VOCABOLI \\"RAINBOW\\",\\"LIBERTY\\",\\"NATURE\\" AND \\"HORSE\\" IN LINGU AINGLESE?","completion":"As I rode on my horse through the countryside, I couldn't help but feel a sense of freedom and wonder at the beauty of nature around me, from the vibrant rainbow in the sky to the free-spirited wild horses roaming in the fields, reminding me of the true meaning of liberty."},{"prompt":"MT8167A 跑分有多少","completion":"答案因设备和测试软件而异。MT8167A是联发科技的一款四核64位ARM Cortex-A35处理器，主要用于低功耗的平板电脑和智能显示器。其性能跑分取决于配备的硬件、操作系统和使用的测试工具。一般而言，MT8167A的安兔兔跑分约为30,000左右，Geekbench跑分约为600单核和1,700多核。请注意，这些跑分仅供参考，不代表实际表现。"},{"prompt":"Фразы топ 50 для глагол","completion":"1.

La demanda es:","completion":"La demanda de duraznos ha sufrido una disminución debido a los efectos de los huaicos en la región. La nueva cantidad demandada es de 600 cajas al mes, mientras que el precio ha aumentado de S/ 4.00 a S/ 6.00 por caja. Por lo tanto, la demanda parece ser elástica, ya que una pequeña variación en el precio ha producido una gran variación en la cantidad demandada. Para calcular el coeficiente de elasticidad precio de la demanda (Epd), utilizamos la siguiente fórmula: Epd = (% de cambio en la cantidad demandada) / (% de cambio en el precio) Donde: % de cambio en la cantidad demandada = ((Nueva cantidad demandada - Cantidad demandada inicial) / Cantidad demandada inicial) x 100 % de cambio en el precio = ((Nuevo precio - Precio inicial) / Precio inicial) x 100 Sustituyendo los valores de nuestro ejemplo, tenemos: % de cambio en la cantidad demandada = ((600 - 1000) / 1000) x 100 = -40% % de cambio en el precio = ((6.00 - 4.00) / 4.00) x 100 = 50% Entonces: Epd = (-40%) / 50% = -0.8 Como el resultado es mayor que -1, podemos decir que la demanda es elástica en este caso.

Jamaica: Pros: - Wide variety of all-inclusive resorts to choose from, such as Couples Resorts, Sandals, and RIU Hotels and Resorts. - Beautiful, white sand beaches and crystal-clear waters for relaxation. - Many off-resort activities to do, such as visiting Dunn's River Falls, the Bob Marley Museum, and Blue Hole. - Rich cultural experiences in music, food, and history. - Friendly and welcoming people. Cons: - Some areas may have higher crime rates, so it's important to stay in safer, tourist-friendly areas. - Can be crowded with tourists during the peak season. 2. Barbados: Pros: - Barbados offers many high-end resorts, such as the Sandals Royal Barbados and the Crane Resort. - The island is generally considered safer for tourists compared to some other Caribbean destinations. - Beautiful beaches and calm waters, such as Carlisle Bay, Crane Beach, and Bathsheba. - Various cultural, historical, and natural attractions to visit, such as Harrison's Cave, George Washington House, and Mount Gay Rum Distillery. - Friendly locals and a diverse cuisine scene.

However, one night in Dublin, McGregor's temper got the best of him, and he made a mistake that would come back to haunt him. It was just after midnight when McGregor entered a pub in the city center. The place was crowded, and as soon as he stepped through the door, he felt the eyes of every patron in the room lock onto him. But McGregor was used to the attention, and he swaggered up to the bar, ordered a drink, and began chatting with the bartender. As he sipped his whiskey, McGregor noticed an old man in the corner of the room staring at him. The man was clearly in his seventies, with a lined face and white hair, and he looked like he had seen his fair share of hard times. McGregor couldn't understand why the old man was staring at him, but the longer he looked, the angrier he became. Without warning, McGregor strode across the room, grabbed the old man by the collar, and punched him square in the jaw. The man fell backward, crashing into a table and slumping to the ground. The other patrons in the pub gasped in shock, but McGregor simply snarled and stormed out the door. The next day, McGregor woke up with a nasty hangover and a clear memory of the night before. But he didn't regret what he had done - after all, he was Conor McGregor, and nobody could stand up to him. That is, until the old man came to find him. Two days after the incident, McGregor was out shopping in central Dublin when he saw the old man walking toward him. McGregor sneered and prepared to deliver another punch, but the old man moved faster than he expected. With lightning speed, he ducked under McGregor's fist and swung at him with a sharp right hook. McGregor didn't stand a chance - the old man's punch connected with his jaw, and he fell back onto the pavement with a dull thud. The old man stood over him for a moment, breathing heavily, before turning and walking away. Conor McGregor was humiliated. He had been knocked out by an old man, and his reputation was in tatters. But there was nothing he could do - he had brought this upon himself. From that day forward, McGregor kept his temper in check and never underestimated his opponents again."},{"prompt":"this led to passing","completion":"I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean by \\"this led to passing\\".

Ecotoxicity tests are conducted to assess the negative impacts of microplastics on the environment. These tests measure the toxicity of microplastics on organisms and their ability to cause harm to living organisms within the ecosystem. Research has shown that microplastics can negatively impact soil health, soil organisms, and plants. Microplastics can inhibit the growth of certain plant species and negatively affect the nutrient uptake in soil organisms. Additionally, the ingestion of microplastics by animals can cause adverse effects such as changes in behavior, reproduction, and immune function.

The core of this platform is a Wafer Scale Integrated (WSI) circuit called WaferIC™. This technology allows a user to simply deposit his integrated circuits randomly on the platform to prototype his electronic system [2]. To ensure connectivity to the components placed on the WaferIC™, its surface is covered by a large number of metallic contacts called NanoPads. A user CAD tool called WaferConnect™ allows users to interact with the hardware through a graphical user interface (GUI). Effective algorithms in the design flow, such as pin detection, package recognition, diagnosis and routing, provide users with a large quantity of information relating to the state of the prototyped system. The fact that the platform is based on a WSI circuit implies the possible presence of defects in this circuit. These defects are managed by inclusion of redundant hardware, as well as a software defect detection algorithm.","completion":"最近提出了一个用于电子系统快速原型的平台[1]。这个平台的核心是一个称为WaferIC™的芯片级集成电路。 这项技术允许用户将集成电路随意放置在平台上进行电子系统的原型设计[2]。为确保与放置在WaferIC™上的组件的连通性，其表面被覆盖了大量的金属接触点，称为NanoPad。一个名为WaferConnect™的用户CAD工具可以通过图形用户界面（GUI）与硬件进行交互。设计流程中的有效算法，如引脚检测、封装识别、诊断和路由，为用户提供了大量有关原型系统状态的信息。这个平台基于芯片级集成电路，意味着这个电路可能存在缺陷。这些缺陷通过包括冗余硬件以及软件缺陷检测算法来进行管理。"},{"prompt":"翻译一下：The functional display of the wafer dataset must manage many objects and must be accurate enough for the user to spot defects and read the status information pertaining to each object. The display process is one that can be called many times per second. This number depends either on the imposed frequency or the user’s actions. A long display time is obviously quite undesirable as it increases user design time and decreases productivity. For such reasons, the aim of the WaferConnect is to obtain a minimum of 10 frames per second, which is a convenient speed for an interactive display in a CAD tool. To meet that goal two alternatives have been proposed. Some authors report the use of images made at the startup of the software (raster graphics [3]) and others use application specific hardware for accelerating vector rendering via OpenGL [4], which allows staying independent of the operating system. Notice that the OpenGL technology is best suited to represent some specific types of data, namely polygons and lines, as the technology is usually expected to produce a fast 3D representation of polygon-based models. Other display techniques exist [3-5], but they are generally application specific combinations of those mentioned before. For example, texture mapping algorithms involves the use of a raster graphics image to fill a polygon. Such algorithms are longer to implement and less adaptable. The current Graphics Processing Units (GPU) available in computer’s graphic cards all support the basic instructions to calculate and draw polygons using the OpenGL API. This paper proposes an optimized exploitation of the GPU to simplify and accelerate the display, even in a 2D scene with user interaction.","completion":"芯片数据集的功能显示必须管理许多对象，并且必须足够准确，以便用户能够发现缺陷并读取与每个对象相关的状态信息。显示过程可以被称为每秒执行多次。这个数字取决于施加的频率或用户的操作。长时间的显示时间显然是不可取的，因为它增加了用户的设计时间并降低了生产力。为此，WaferConnect的目标是获得至少10帧每秒的速度，这是CAD工具中交互式显示的方便速度。为了实现这个目标，提出了两个替代方案。一些作者报告了使用在软件启动时制作的图像（光栅图形[3]），而其他人则使用应用程序特定的硬件通过OpenGL来加速矢量渲染[4]，这允许保持独立于操作系统。请注意，OpenGL技术最适合表示某些特定类型的数据，即多边形和线段，因为通常期望这项技术能够快速生成基于多边形模型的3D表示。还存在其他显示技术[3-5]，但它们通常是前面提到的应用程序特定组合。例如，纹理映射算法涉及使用光栅图形图像来填充多边形。这些算法实现起来更加复杂，适应性也更差。计算机图形卡中的当前图形处理单元（GPU）都支持使用OpenGL API计算和绘制多边形的基本指令。本文提出了一种优化GPU的利用方法，简化和加速显示，即使在具有用户交互的2D场景中。"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},I={class:"card-container"},L={key:0,class:"empty-state"},W=["disabled"],M={key:0},E={key:1};function z(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",I,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",L,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
