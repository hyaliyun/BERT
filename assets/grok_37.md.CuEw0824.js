Can the sequence ( {a_n} ) be infinite?","completion":"# Problem: Given a natural number (a_0), a sequence ( {a_n}) can be constructed using the following rules: 1. If the last digit of (a_{n-1}) does not exceed 5, then remove that last digit to obtain (a_n). 2. Otherwise, set (a_n = 9a_{n-1}). Determine whether the sequence ( {a_n} ) can be infinite. Let's analyze whether the sequence ( {a_n} ) can be infinite by examining the sequence generation rules. 1. **Case 1: Last Digit Does Not Exceed 5** If the last digit of ( a_{n-1} ) (a) does not exceed 5, then: [ a_n = frac{a_{n-1} - a}{10} ] Here, we are effectively removing the last digit from ( a_{n-1} ). Since a leqslant 5, it implies: [ 10a_n leqslant a_{n-1} - 1 ] The resulting number, (a_n), is at most 10^{-1} times less than (a_{n-1}), indicating that: [ a_n < a_{n-1} ] Hence, in this scenario, the sequence is monotonically decreasing. 2. **Case 2: Last Digit Exceeds 5** If the last digit of ( a_{n-1} ) exceeds 5, we perform the operation: [ a_n = 9a_{n-1} ] For (a_n) in the future steps, the last digit is again checked. The crucial observation is that after applying (a_n = 9a_{n-1}), the new number may eventually fall into Case 1 after a few iterations, as demonstrated below. - Suppose (a_{n-1}) has digits such that the operation (a_n = 9a_{n-1}) causes the final digit to not exceed 5. - Applying Case 1 in the subsequent steps reveals the decreasing pattern. [ 10a_{n+1} leqslant a_n = 9a_{n-1} ] The inequalities will shift dependently: [ a_{n+1} leqslant a_n - text{[last digit exceeding 5]} ] Here (a_{n+1}) is divisible by 10, and since 9 and 10 are non-multiplicative complements after several iterations, this results in: [ 10a_{n+1} leqslant 9a_{n-1} ] Once again, this confirms: [ a_{n+1} < a_{n} ] 3. **Conclusion:** By repeated checking, eventually, (a_n) diminishes to a value where the sequence rapidly shrinks or reaches zero. Hence, the sequence ( {a_n} ) cannot be infinite as there are finite natural numbers and each iteration reduces the number in hand or eventually terminates.

Step-by-Step Approach: 1. **Consider an Arbitrary Quadrilateral and Reducing Perimeter**: - Let's begin with any arbitrary quadrilateral ABCD with a given area S. - We'll gradually transform this quadrilateral while reducing its perimeter. 2. **Transform Triangles within the Quadrilateral**: - First, consider triangles ABC and ACD formed by the diagonal AC. - Transform these triangles into isosceles triangles by moving vertices B and D along lines parallel to diagonal AC. This transformation does not change the area of the quadrilateral but can potentially reduce its perimeter. 3. **Obtaining Isosceles Triangles**: - For simplicity, assume now that triangles ABC and ACD are already isosceles with AB = BC and AD = DC, respectively. 4. **Second Transformation with the Other Diagonal**: - Now, consider triangles ABD and BCD formed by the diagonal BD. - Transform these triangles into isosceles triangles by moving vertices A and C along lines parallel to diagonal BD. Again, this transformation does not change the area of the quadrilateral but can reduce its perimeter further. 5. **Reduction to a Rhombus**: - After such transformations, we can derive that the quadrilateral ABCD becomes a rhombus. 6. **Relating Perimeter and Area in the Rhombus**: - Let the side length of the rhombus be a and the angle between two adjacent sides be alpha. - The area S of the rhombus can be expressed as: [ S = AB^2 sin alpha = a^2 sin alpha ] - The perimeter P_1 of the rhombus is: [ P_1 = 4a ] 7. **Compare Perimeter**: - We substitute a from the area formula: [ a = sqrt{frac{S}{sin alpha}} ] - Hence, the perimeter P_1 becomes: [ P_1 = 4 sqrt{frac{S}{sin alpha}} ] 8. **Minimizing the Perimeter**: - The inequality becomes: [ P geq P_1 = 4 sqrt{frac{S}{sin alpha}} geq 4 sqrt{S} ] - The equality can be achieved when sin alpha = 1, i.e., alpha = 90^circ. 9. **Conclusion**: - This implies that the rhombus becomes a square when alpha = 90^circ.

Consequently, when one function's graph touches the other (i.e., they are tangent to each other), they either touch at a point on the line ( y = x ), or they are perpendicular to this line at the point of tangency. 3. Let's establish the relationship of their slopes at the point of tangency. - The derivative of ( y = a^x ) is: [ y' = a^x ln a ] 4.

Since gleft(frac{1}{e}right) = e + frac{1}{e}, g(1) = 2, g(5) = 5 + frac{1}{5} = frac{26}{5}, And 2 < e + frac{1}{e} < frac{26}{5}, therefore g(1) < gleft(frac{1}{e}right) < g(5), Therefore, for all x_2 in left[frac{1}{e}, 5right], g_{min}(x_2) = g(1) = 2, g_{max}(x_2) = g(5) = frac{26}{5}. (i) When t + 1 > 0, i.e., t > -1, for all x_1, x_2 in left[frac{1}{e}, 5right], frac{f(x_1) - g(x_2)}{t+1} leqslant 1 always holds, Leftrightarrow t + 1 geqslant left[f(x_1) - g(x_2)right]_{max} Leftrightarrow t geqslant left[f(x_1) - g(x_2)right]_{max} - 1, Since f(x_1) - g(x_2) leqslant f(1) - g(1) = -1 - 2 = -3, therefore t geqslant -3 - 1 = -4, and t > -1, therefore t > -1. (ii) When t + 1 < 0, i.e., t < -1, for all x_1, x_2 in left[frac{1}{e}, 5right], frac{f(x_1) - g(x_2)}{t+1} leqslant 1 always holds, Leftrightarrow t + 1 leqslant left[f(x_1) - g(x_2)right]_{min} Leftrightarrow t leqslant left[f(x_1) - g(x_2)right]_{min} - 1, Since f(x_1) - g(x_2) geqslant f(3) - g(3) = -25 + 2ln 5 - frac{26}{5} = -frac{151}{5} + 2ln 5, therefore t leqslant -frac{151}{5} + 2ln 5 - 1 = -frac{156}{5} + 2ln 5, And t < -1, therefore t leqslant -frac{156}{5} + 2ln 5.

As we add one city at a time each year and restructure the roads by connecting the new city to a cycle being destroyed, we essentially break and then reform the graph to avoid cycles. 4. **Connectivity Assertion**: - After a certain number of steps, the graph will no longer have any cycles, since each newly introduced city eliminates at least one cycle. - The new structure is such that it maintains connectivity while eliminating internal cycles. 5. **End State Configuration**: - After sufficiently many iterations, the number of cities will be the initially given ( 2002 ) plus each year a new city, resulting in the tree structure. - The graph becomes a tree structure due to continual cycle elimination. Since a tree with ( N=2002 ) cities is connected and free of cycles, it will have exactly ( N-1=2001 ) edges. Conclusively, the number of cities connected without a cycle ensures that there are 2002 cities eventually in a single connected tree structure. This tree, by definition, will have ( 2001 ) edges.

The nth even integer can be represented as 2n, where n is a positive integer.

Each region adjacent to both of the other two must have a unique color (Case 2). * We must ensure that every new region added can still adhere to the coloring constraint without exceeding four colors. 2. **Adjacent Regions Analysis**: * Consider a configuration of four regions ( Gamma, mathcal{W}, mathcal{K}, mathcal{Z} ).

Here we consider three cases: ( N = 64 ), ( N = 55 ), and ( N = 100 ). Case (a) ( N = 64 ): 1. Each friend knows only one piece of news initially. 2. After 1 hour, through conversations, a single piece of news can be shared with at most 2 friends. 3. Following this pattern, the information spreads as: - After 1 hour: a news is known by 2 friends. - After 2 hours: a news is known by 4 friends. - After 3 hours: a news is known by 8 friends. - After 4 hours: a news is known by 16 friends. - After 5 hours: a news is known by 32 friends. - After 6 hours: a news is known by all 64 friends.

Using the cosine of supplementary angle identity, (cos(180^circ - theta) = -cos(theta)), we get: [ cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta + cos^2 (alpha + beta) - 2 cos alpha cos beta cos (alpha + beta) = 1 ] 5.

Hence, if we can prove the statement for ( k leq frac{n}{2} ), it will also hold for ( k > frac{n}{2} ). 2. **Case 1: ( k geq sqrt{n} )**: - By Sylvester's theorem, (binom{n}{k}) is divisible by a prime factor larger than ( k ) and hence larger than (sqrt{n}). - Since this prime factor is larger than (sqrt{n}), we have ( v_p(binom{n}{k}) = 1 ). Therefore, (binom{n}{k}) cannot be a perfect power because a perfect power would require all prime factors to have exponents that are multiples of ( l geq 2 ). 3. **Case 2: ( 4 leq k leq sqrt{n} )**: - We claim that there exist integers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k ) and ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_k ) such that (prod a_i = k!), ( a_i b_i = n - i + 1 ), and for each prime ( 2 leq p leq k ), there is at most one term among the ( b_i ) divisible by ( p ) (hence the ( b_i ) are co-prime). 4. **Constructing ( a_i ) and ( b_i )**: - Consider a prime ( p ) between ( 2 ) and ( k ). Let ( f_p ) be a number between ( n ) and ( n - k + 1 ) which has the maximal possible value of ( v_p ). - For all ( a_i ) such that ( n - i + 1 neq f_p ), set ( v_p(a_i) = v_p(n - i + 1) ). - For the ( a_i ) corresponding to ( f_p ), adjust ( v_p(a_i) ) such that it agrees with (prod a_i = k!). - By induction, we can check that this doesn't make any ( v_p(a_i) ) negative. 5. **Checking the Co-primality of ( b_i )**: - Repeat the above process for each ( 2 leq p leq k ). It is straightforward to check that the ( a_i, b_i ) thus produced are indeed integers and they satisfy all the conditions in our claim. Hence, the ( b_i ) are co-prime. 6. **Contradiction for ( binom{n}{k} = m^l ) with ( l geq 2 )**: - If (binom{n}{k} = m^l) for some ( l geq 2 ), then all the ( b_i ) are perfect ( l )-th powers. - We note that either the ( a_i ) are ( 1, 2, 3, ldots, k ) in some order or two of the ( a_i ) are equal. 7. **Case: Two ( a_i ) are Equal**: - If two of the ( a_i ) are equal, we get ( a(b^l - c^l) = d ) where ( ab^l, ac^l ) are between ( n ) and ( n - sqrt{n} ) and ( a, d ) are between ( 1 ) and ( sqrt{n} ). - We can size-bound and show that ( d geq a l c^{l-1} ) and note an easy size bounding contradiction as the size of ( ac^l ) is on the order of ( n ) while the size of ( a, d ) are lower than ( sqrt{n} ). 8. **Case: ( a_i ) are ( 1, 2, 3, ldots, k ) in Some Order**: - Take ( i, j, k ) such that ( a_i = lfloor frac{k}{4} rfloor, a_j = 2a_i ), and ( a_k = 2a_j ). - So the corresponding ( a_i b_i ) will be ( lfloor frac{k}{4} rfloor a^l, lfloor frac{k}{4} rfloor cdot 2b^l, lfloor frac{k}{4} rfloor cdot 4c^l ) for some ( a, b, c ) and ( l geq 2 ), and these numbers are between ( n ) and ( n - k ) and hence between ( n ) and ( n - sqrt{n} ). - Now we see that ( d = 4 cdot lfloor frac{k}{4} rfloor^2 cdot ((ac)^l - (b^2)^l) ) is less than ( frac{nk}{2} ). - So an easy size argument shows that ( l geq 3 ) is not possible as ( m^l - n^l ) cannot be lower than ( m^l - (m-1)^l ) whose size is on the order of ( l m^{l-1} ). 9. **Final Case: ( l = 2 )**: - Consider ( a_r, a_s ) such that ( a_r = 1, a_s = 4 ) (as ( k geq 4 )). - Then, ( a_r b_r ) and ( a_s b_s ) are two distinct perfect squares (as the ( b_i ) are perfect ( l )-th powers) between ( n ) and ( n - sqrt{n} ). - However, this is a clear contradiction because for two distinct positive integers ( a, b ), the numbers ( a^2, b^2 ) are at least ( 2a - 1 ) apart. 10. **Conclusion**: - For ( 4 leq k leq n - 4 ), we have shown that (binom{n}{k}) cannot be a perfect power.

If the line does not pass through the origin, it will intersect the axes at points where x and y are equal but non-zero. Let's denote the common intercept as a. Then, the line intersects the x-axis at (a, 0) and the y-axis at (0, a). The slope of such a line would be frac{-a}{a} = -1.

Here, (A') and (B') are the projections onto the first picture plane. - For (A'), the right triangle (A'KM) is formed. - For (B'), the right triangle (B'HN) is formed. In the drawing, these triangles are shown with (A'KM) and (B'HN). 4. **Constructing Circles:** - Draw circles around (A') with radius (A'M). - Draw circles around (B') with radius (B'N). 5. **Finding Tangency:** The tangent lines to these circles represent the first traces of the desired planes. These lines must pass through the first trace point (S_1) of the line segment (AB). Therefore, there are only two possible solutions. 6. **Second Trace Determination:** Locate the second trace point (S_2) of the line (AB). This point helps in determining the second trace of the plane. 7. **Using Projection:** Introduce a third projection plane perpendicular to the already determined plane, using the new axis (t_3). 8. **Third Projection of Points A and B:** Determine the third projections of points (A) and (B), which lie on the third trace of the plane (s_3). 9. **Construct Fourth Projection Plane:** The fourth projection plane is parallel to the plane of (S_1S_2). Consequently, the new axis (t_4) is parallel to (s_3). In this projection, both the distances between points (A^{IV}) and (B^{IV}) and the desired circle are clearly visible. 10. **Constructing and Utilizing the Fourth Projections:** Locate the fourth projections of points (A) and (B). To properly construct the fourth projection of the circle, note that the circle tangents the first picture plane. The tangency point thus lies on the third trace of the plane as indicated by point (C^{primeprimeprime}) on axis (t_3). 11. **Intersection Points:** The tangency point lies perpendicularly to (t_4) because it’s aligned with (C^{primeprimeprime}) on (t_4). Draw the fourth projection of the circle to be tangent to (C^{primeprimeprime}C^{IV}) and passing through (A^{IV}) and (B^{IV}). 12. **Transferring to Lower Projections:** Using the fourth projection, we can deduce the third, first, and second projections of the desired circle. 13. **Constructing the Cone:** The peak of the cone will be the intersection of the perpendicular from point (O'') (from (A^{IV}B^{IV})) onto the second projection of the circle. This ensures the cone’s highest generator will be parallel with the first project plane. 14. **Constructing Final Elements:** Detail the final components using the second projection of the line from the computed peak downwards, reflecting back to the first project for establishing complete understanding. By following the thorough steps and essential projections, the construction of the circle and cone relative to the given initial parameters becomes clear and straightforward. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Solution steps detailed above provide the construction and projections required for the given problem.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Consider the geometric sequence {a_n} that satisfies a_1 + a_3 = 10 and a_2 + a_4 = 5.

Thus, triangle ( ABC ) is a right triangle with right angle at ( B ), and sides ( AB = AC = 1 ), and ( BC = sqrt{2} ). 2. **Point location and distances**: - Let ( k = 2 - sqrt{2} ). - Point ( D ) is located on ( AB ) such that the distance from ( A ) to ( D ) is ( k ). - Point ( E ) is located on ( AC ) such that the distance from ( A ) to ( E ) is ( k ). - Point ( F ) is also on ( AC ), but it is located such that the distance from ( C ) to ( F ) is ( k ). - Point ( G ) is on ( BC ) such that the distance from ( C ) to ( G ) is ( k ). 3. **Determine distances between specific points**: - The distance between ( D ) and ( F ) (both calculated using ( A ), thus on line segments): [ AF = AC - CF = 1 - k = 1 - (2 - sqrt{2}) = sqrt{2} - 1 ] - Using the Euclidean distance formula in coordinate geometry: [ DF = sqrt{(1 - k)^2 + (k)^2} = sqrt{(sqrt{2} - 1)^2 + k^2} = k ] - Similarly: [ EG = DG = k ] 4. **Coloring and constraints**: When coloring these points with four colors, we need to ensure: - ( A ) and ( C ) are each at least ( k ) distance from all other points. So, they must use two unique colors. Let’s say ( A ) uses color 1 and ( C ) uses color 2. - ( D ) and ( G ) are ( k ) apart and hence must be different colors. Since ( A ) and ( C ) have used colors 1 and 2 respectively, let ( D ) use color 3 and ( G ) use color 4. - ( E ) is distance ( k ) from ( G ), hence must not use color 4, so let ( E ) use color 1. - ( F ) is distance ( k ) from ( D ), hence must not use color 3, so let ( F ) use color 2. 5. **Problem with ( B )**: Note that point ( B ) needs a different color and it's distance to ( E ) and ( F ) are more than ( k ): - Since ( E ) (( color 1 )), ( F ) (( color 2 )), ( D ) (( color 3 )), and ( G ) (( color 4 )), we run out of colors to color ( B ). 6. **Conclusion**: Thus, it is impossible to four-color these points so that no two points of the same color are ( k ) or more apart. Therefore, there must be at least two points of the same color at a distance ( 2 - sqrt{2} ) or more apart.

Thus, the probability of eventual success, if he fails ( k ) times at the second obstacle, is: [ p_k = s_1 left( b_2 s_1 right)^k cdot s_2 ] To find the total success probability, we sum these probabilities over all possible ( k ): [ P(text{success}) = sum_{k=0}^{infty} p_k = s_1 s_2 sum_{k=0}^{infty} left( b_2 s_1 right)^k ] 3. **Summing the Infinite Series**: The series ( sum_{k=0}^{infty} left( b_2 s_1 right)^k ) is an infinite geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio ( b_2 s_1 ).

A straight road passes through the midpoint of the segment connecting the bases of the towers and forms a 30^circ angle with this segment. Determine the point on the road from which the two towers appear at the same angle. Investigate how the number of solutions depends on the value of lambda.","completion":"1. Let's introduce the necessary notation and determine the setup of the problem. We denote the heights of two towers as ( h_A ) and ( h_B ) such that the ratio of their heights is ( lambda ), i.e., [ frac{h_A}{h_B} = lambda. ] For convenience, we can assume ( lambda > 1 ) by appropriately labeling the towers. If ( lambda = 1 ), then the point ( F ), the midpoint of the line segment joining the base points ( A ) and ( B ), will be the only point from which both towers appear under the same angle, and no further points satisfy this condition. 2. Consider a point ( U ) on the road, which passes through the midpoint ( F ) of the segment ( AB ) and makes a 30-degree angle with it. We label the apex points of the towers ( A^* ) and ( B^* ). Since the towers and the point ( U ) form right triangles ( A^*UA ) and ( B^*UB ), the angles of view from ( U ) to both towers are equal. 3. Using the similarity of the triangles ( A^*UA ) and ( B^*UB ), we have: [ frac{UA}{UB} = lambda. ] 4. Let's denote ( AF = FB = a ) and ( FU = x ). By applying the cosine rule in triangles ( UFA ) and ( UFB ), we obtain: [ UA^2 = x^2 + a^2 + sqrt{3}ax, ] [ UB^2 = x^2 + a^2 - sqrt{3}ax. ] Because ( frac{UA}{UB} = lambda ), we square both sides and set up the following equation: [ left(frac{UA}{UB}right)^2 = lambda^2 Rightarrow frac{x^2 + a^2 + sqrt{3}ax}{x^2 + a^2 - sqrt{3}ax} = lambda^2. ] 5. Solving for ( frac{x}{a} ), we get: [ frac{(frac{x}{a})^2 + 1 + sqrt{3}frac{x}{a}}{(frac{x}{a})^2 + 1 - sqrt{3}frac{x}{a}} = lambda^2. ] 6. To simplify, let ( t = frac{x}{a} ). Then: [ frac{t^2 + 1 + sqrt{3}t}{t^2 + 1 - sqrt{3}t} = lambda^2. ] 7. Cross-multiplying and simplifying yields a quadratic equation in ( t ): [ t^2 left(lambda^2 - 1right) + tleft(2sqrt{3}right) + 1 = 0. ] 8. The solution to this quadratic equation is given by: [ t_{1,2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} frac{lambda^2 + 1}{lambda^2 - 1} pm sqrt{left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2} frac{lambda^2 + 1}{lambda^2 - 1}right)^2 - 1}. ] 9. For real solutions to exist, the discriminant must be non-negative: [ left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2} frac{lambda^2 + 1}{lambda^2 - 1}right)^2 - 1 geq 0. ] 10. Evaluating this condition, we find: [ frac{3}{4} left(frac{lambda^2 + 1}{lambda^2 - 1}right)^2 - 1 geq 0. ] Simplifying, we get: [ frac{lambda^2 + 1}{lambda^2 - 1} geq frac{2}{sqrt{3}}. ] Rearranging and solving for ( lambda ): [ lambda^2 + 1 geq 4 lambda Rightarrow lambda^2 - 4 lambda + 1 geq 0. ] 11. Solving this quadratic inequality: [ lambda^2 - 4lambda + 1 = 0 Rightarrow lambda = 2 pm sqrt{3}. ] 12. Therefore: [ lambda geq 2 + sqrt{3} text{ or } lambda leq 2 - sqrt{3}. ] Since ( lambda > 1 ), the second inequality is invalid. 13. Conclusion: - When ( lambda > 2 + sqrt{3} ), there are no solutions. - When ( lambda = 2 + sqrt{3} ), there is exactly one solution. - When ( 1 < lambda < 2 + sqrt{3} ), there are two solutions.

Identify potential vertical asymptotes: The vertical asymptotes occur at the values of x that make the denominator zero, which are x=2 and x=-3, unless a factor in the numerator cancels with the denominator. 3. Check for cancellation to eliminate an asymptote: - For x-2 to be a factor of x^2-x+c, by the Factor theorem, we substitute x=2 into x^2-x+c and set it equal to 0: 2^2 - 2 + c = 0 Rightarrow 4 - 2 + c = 0 Rightarrow c = -2. - For x+3 to be a factor of x^2-x+c, again by the Factor theorem, we substitute x=-3 into x^2-x+c and set it equal to 0: (-3)^2 - (-3) + c = 0 Rightarrow 9 + 3 + c = 0 Rightarrow c = -12. 4.

First, recall that a function ( f ) is continuous on an interval ( (a, b) ) if for every ( c ) in ( (a, b) ) and every (epsilon > 0), there exists a (delta > 0) such that ( |f(x) - f(c)| < epsilon ) whenever ( |x - c| < delta ). 3. **Example to disprove the statement**: To disprove that continuity on ((a, b)) implies boundedness, it is sufficient to find a counterexample. 4. **Counterexample**: Consider the function ( f(x) = frac{1}{x} ). - **Continuity verification**: The function ( f(x) = frac{1}{x} ) is continuous on the interval ((0, 1)). This is because, for any ( c in (0, 1) ) and for all (epsilon > 0), there exists a (delta > 0) such that if ( 0 < |x - c| < delta ), then ( left| frac{1}{x} - frac{1}{c} right| < epsilon ). This holds since the function is smooth and without discontinuities within the open interval ((0, 1)). - **Unbounded verification**: Now, consider the behavior of ( f(x) ) as ( x ) approaches 0 from the right. As ( x to 0^+ ), ( frac{1}{x} ) grows without bound. Hence, ( f(x) ) is not bounded above because, for any large number ( M ), there exists some ( x in (0, 1) ) such that ( f(x) > M ). 5. **Conclusion**: The function ( f(x) = frac{1}{x} ) serves as a counterexample showing that a function can be continuous on an interval ((a, b)) but not bounded.

Before the decrease in manufacturing cost, the profit from the sale of each key chain was 20% of the selling price. This means that the profit was ( 0.20P ). The cost of manufacturing each key chain before the decrease was 80, so the selling price was ( P = 80 + 0.20P ). To find ( P ), we can solve for it: ( P - 0.20P = 80 ) ( 0.80P = 80 ) ( P = 80 / 0.80 ) ( P = 100 ) So, the selling price of each key chain was 100 before the decrease in manufacturing cost. After the decrease in manufacturing cost, the cost is now 50, but the selling price remains the same at 100. The new profit for each key chain is the selling price minus the new manufacturing cost: Profit = Selling Price - New Manufacturing Cost Profit = 100 - 50 Profit = 50 Now, to find the profit percentage of the selling price after the decrease in manufacturing cost, we use the formula: Profit Percentage = (Profit / Selling Price) * 100% Substituting the values we have: Profit Percentage = (50 / 100) * 100% Profit Percentage = 0.50 * 100% Profit Percentage = 50% So, the profit percentage of the selling price after the decrease in manufacturing cost is boxed{50%} ."},{"prompt":"On a 12hour clock, find the least whole number of hours that is greater than 9 and is clock equivalent to its squared number of hours.","completion":"We find the next such time after 9 hours.

This can be simplified to f(x-2) = f(-x-2), which implies f(x) = f(-x-4). This shows that the function f(x) is symmetric about the line x = -2. Additionally, from the given f(x-3) + f(-x+1) = 0, we can deduce that -f(x-3) = f(-x+1). Substituting x with x+2, we get f(x) = -f(-x-2), indicating that f(x) is also symmetric about the point (-1,0). This symmetry implies that the function f(x) has a period of 4. Given f(x) = frac{1}{a^x} - ax - 4 for x in [-2,-1] and f(-2) = 4, we can find the value of a by substituting x = -2 into the equation, resulting in 4 = frac{1}{a^{-2}} - 2a - 4.

To calculate sum_{k=1}^{19}{|f(k)|}, we first determine the values of f(x) for x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

The value of h/r can be written in the form msqrt {n}, where m and n are positive integers and n is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find m + n.","completion":"To solve this problem, let's break down the solution into detailed steps: 1. **Identify the Path Traced by the Cone**: When the cone rolls on the table without slipping, the path traced by the point where the cone's base meets the table is a circular arc. This arc is centered at the point where the vertex of the cone touches the table. The radius of this arc is equal to the slant height of the cone. 2. **Calculate the Slant Height**: The slant height of the cone can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius, height, and slant height of the cone. The slant height is sqrt{r^2 + h^2}. 3. **Determine the Length of the Path**: The length of the path traced by the cone is the circumference of the circle with radius equal to the slant height, which is 2pisqrt{r^2 + h^2}. 4. **Relate the Length of the Path to the Cone's Rotations**: The cone returns to its original position after making 17 complete rotations. Each rotation corresponds to the circumference of the base of the cone, which is 2pi r. Therefore, the total length of the path after 17 rotations is 17 times 2pi r = 34pi r. 5. **Set Up and Solve the Equation**: Equating the two expressions for the length of the path, we have: [ 2pisqrt{r^2 + h^2} = 34pi r ] Simplifying this equation, we find: [ sqrt{r^2 + h^2} = 17r ] Squaring both sides gives: [ r^2 + h^2 = 289r^2 ] Rearranging and simplifying, we get: [ h^2 = 288r^2 ] 6. **Find the Ratio dfrac{h}{r}**: Taking the square root of both sides of the equation h^2 = 288r^2, we obtain: [ dfrac{h}{r} = sqrt{288} = 12sqrt{2} ] 7. **Calculate the Final Answer**: The value of h/r is 12sqrt{2}.

We will draw lines from vertex ( A ) to the opposite side ( BC ). 3. **Drawing the Lines:** - Divide the side ( BC ) into three equal segments. Let ( BC = n ) be the length of the side, so each segment will have a length of ( frac{n}{3} ). - Let ( D ) and ( E ) be the points on ( BC ) such that ( BD = DE = EC = frac{n}{3} ). 4. **Constructing the Partition Lines:** - Draw a line from vertex ( A ) to point ( D ). - Draw another line from vertex ( A ) to point ( E ). These lines will intersect the side ( BC ) at ( D ) and ( E ), thereby partitioning the original triangle ( ABC ) into three smaller triangles: ( ABD, ADE,) and ( AEC ). 5. **Verification:** - Each of the new triangles ( ABD, ADE, ) and ( AEC ) should share the same area. Given that ( BD = DE = EC = frac{n}{3} ), it follows that they are indeed congruent by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) criterion. All triangles share two sides formed by the partition lines and the original side ( BC ), and the included angle at ( A ). 6. **Conclusion:** - By drawing lines from the vertex to partition the opposite side into equal segments, we can successfully divide the original triangle into three congruent smaller triangles. Thus, the final division of the triangle will result in three equal parts that are identical in shape and size. The solution and construction fit the criteria given in the problem.

Prove that two of a,b,c have the same magnitude. *Evan O'Dorney.*","completion":"To prove that two of (a, b, c) have the same magnitude given the conditions (a + b + c = 0) and (a^n + b^n + c^n = 0), we can proceed as follows: 1. **Initial Setup and Simplification:** Given (a + b + c = 0), we can express (c) as: [ c = -(a + b) ] Substituting (c) into the second condition (a^n + b^n + c^n = 0), we get: [ a^n + b^n + (-(a + b))^n = 0 ] Simplifying the expression ((-(a + b))^n), we have: [ (-(a + b))^n = (-1)^n (a + b)^n ] Therefore, the equation becomes: [ a^n + b^n + (-1)^n (a + b)^n = 0 ] 2. **Case Analysis Based on Parity of (n):** - **Case 1: (n) is even.** If (n) is even, then ((-1)^n = 1). The equation simplifies to: [ a^n + b^n + (a + b)^n = 0 ] This implies: [ a^n + b^n + (a + b)^n = 0 ] Since (a, b, c) are complex numbers, we need to consider the magnitudes. Let (|a| = r), (|b| = s), and (|a + b| = t). The magnitudes must satisfy: [ r^n + s^n + t^n = 0 ] Since (r^n, s^n, t^n) are non-negative and their sum is zero, it must be that (r = s = t = 0). This implies that (a, b, c) are all zero, which contradicts the assumption that (a, b, c) are non-zero complex numbers. Therefore, this case does not provide any new information. - **Case 2: (n) is odd.** If (n) is odd, then ((-1)^n = -1). The equation simplifies to: [ a^n + b^n - (a + b)^n = 0 ] This implies: [ a^n + b^n = (a + b)^n ] Again, considering the magnitudes, we have: [ r^n + s^n = t^n ] Since (r, s, t) are non-negative, this equation suggests that (r, s, t) must be such that the sum of the (n)-th powers of (r) and (s) equals the (n)-th power of (t). This can only happen if (r = s) or (r = t) or (s = t). 3. **Conclusion:** From the above analysis, we see that in both cases (whether (n) is even or odd), the conditions imply that at least two of the magnitudes (|a|, |b|, |c|) must be equal. Therefore, we conclude that two of (a, b, c) have the same magnitude. (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"There are 5 boys and 4 girls in a classroom.

We can align the corresponding vectors (boldsymbol{a}) and (boldsymbol{b}) on the same straight line.

Find the maximum possible number of words in such a language.","completion":"1. **Introduction and Maximum Number of Words Calculation** To solve the problem of finding the maximum number of valid words in a language containing only the letters 'a' and 'u' with each word having at most 13 letters, follow these steps: 2. **Counting the Total Possible Sequences of Lengths 1 to 13** The total number of possible sequences (\`N\`) that can be formed using the letters 'a' and 'u' with a length not exceeding 13 can be calculated as: [ N = 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ldots + 2^{13} ] This series is a geometric series with the first term (a = 2) and the common ratio (r = 2). The sum of the first (n) terms of a geometric series (a(1 + r + r^2 + ldots + r^{n-1})) is given by: [ S_n = a frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} ] Substituting (a = 2), (r = 2), and (n = 13): [ N = 2 left(frac{2^{13} - 1}{2 - 1}right) = 2 (2^{13} - 1) = 2^{14} - 2 ] 3. **Summation of Valid Words** Valid words are sequences of lengths from 7 to 13 inclusive. The number of such sequences can be calculated similarly: [ S = 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^{10} + 2^{11} + 2^{12} + 2^{13} ] This also forms a geometric series. The sum is: [ S = 2^7(1 + 2 + 2^2 + ldots + 2^6) = 2^7 left(frac{2^7 - 1}{2 - 1}right) = 2^7 (2^7 - 1) = 2^{14} - 2^7 ] 4. **Application of Problem Constraints** Consider that concatenating any two words (valid sequences) does not produce another valid word. Suppose the language can form exactly (2^{14} - 2^7) valid words. To verify this, consider avoiding sequences shorter than 7 or longer than 13. 5. **Conclusion** Thus, using the derived formula and ensuring no valid word gets repeated or concatenated improperly, the maximum number of valid words is: [ boxed{16056} ] [Summary: text{The maximum number of valid words in the language described is } 16056.]"},{"prompt":"Evaluate the ratio frac{10^{2010}+10^{2013}}{10^{2011}+10^{2014}} and determine which whole number it is closest to.","completion":"Begin by simplifying the expression: frac{10^{2010}+10^{2013}}{10^{2011}+10^{2014}}.

In this case, the items are people and the containers are the months of the year. 3. **Calculating the Minimum Number of People per Month:** There are 12 months in a year, and we have 52 people. According to the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one month must contain at least [ leftlceil frac{52}{12} rightrceil = leftlceil 4.333 ldots rightrceil = 5 ] people. Here, ( leftlceil x rightrceil ) denotes the ceiling function, which rounds ( x ) up to the nearest integer. 4. **Verifying the Result:** To ensure that 5 is indeed the largest value of ( n ) that always holds true, consider the distribution scenario where 11 months have 4 people each and 1 month has 8 people. This distribution satisfies the total of 52 people and shows that it is possible for no month to have more than 8 people. However, if we claim that at least 6 people must share a birthday month, then distributing the people such that each month has at most 5 people (11 months with 5 people and 1 month with 2 people) still sums to 57, which exceeds 52. Hence, it is not always possible to have at least 6 people per month. 5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the largest value of ( n ) such that at least ( n ) people in the room have birthdays in the same month is ( n = 5 ).

First, we calculate the derivative of f(x), which is f'(x) = frac{1}{x} - a for x > 0. 2. **Case 1:** When a leqslant 0, it's clear from the derivative that f'(x) gt 0 for all x > 0. This means f(x) is monotonically increasing over the interval (0, +infty). 3. **Case 2:** When a gt 0, we examine the sign of f'(x): - If f'(x) gt 0, solving frac{1}{x} - a gt 0 gives 0 < x < frac{1}{a}. - If f'(x) lt 0, solving frac{1}{x} - a lt 0 gives x > frac{1}{a}. Therefore, f(x) increases on the interval (0, frac{1}{a}) and decreases on (frac{1}{a}, +infty). Part (2): Range of a for f(x) leqslant 0 1.

Since B's work rate is ( frac{1}{60} ) of the work per day, we can calculate the number of days B will take to finish the remaining work as follows: Let ( d ) be the number of days B needs to work to finish the remaining ( frac{3}{4} ) of the work. ( B's work rate times d = frac{3}{4} ) of the work ( frac{1}{60} times d = frac{3}{4} ) To find ( d ), we solve for ( d ): ( d = frac{3}{4} times 60 ) ( d = frac{3}{4} times frac{60}{1} ) ( d = frac{3 times 60}{4} ) ( d = frac{180}{4} ) ( d = 45 ) days So, B will take boxed{45} days to finish the remaining work after A leaves."},{"prompt":"Let {x_n}_{n=1}^infty be a sequence such that x_1=25 , x_n=operatorname{arctan}(x_{n1}) .

This is because arctan(x) is the integral arctan(x) = int_0^x frac{dt}{t^2 + 1}, and since t^2 + 1 > 1 for all t geq 0, we have arctan(x) < int_0^x dt = x. - Therefore, x_n > 0 for all n and x_n is strictly decreasing. 3. **Convergence**: - Since x_n is strictly decreasing and bounded below by 0, it must converge to some limit a geq 0. 4. **Fixed Point Analysis**: - If x_n to a, then taking the limit on both sides of the recurrence relation x_n = arctan(x_{n-1}), we get: [ a = arctan(a) ] - The function arctan(x) has a unique fixed point at a = 0 because arctan(x) = x only when x = 0. 5. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, the limit of the sequence {x_n}_{n=1}^infty is a = 0.

Since e = frac{1}{2}, we have frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}} = frac{a^{2}-c^{2}}{a^{2}} = 1 - e^{2} = frac{3}{4}, so b^{2} = 3. Thus, the equation of the ellipse C is frac{x^{2}}{4} + frac{y^{2}}{3} = 1. 2. From the problem, when the slope of line AB does not exist, let's assume A(x_{0}, x_{0}) and B(x_{0}, -x_{0}). Since points A and B are on ellipse C, we have frac{x_{0}^{2}}{4} + frac{x_{0}^{2}}{3} = 1, so x_{0}^{2} = frac{12}{7}. Thus, the distance d from point O to line AB is d = sqrt{frac{12}{7}} = frac{2sqrt{21}}{7}. When the slope of line AB exists, let's assume the equation of line AB is y = kx + m. By solving the system of equations begin{cases} y = kx + m frac{x^{2}}{4} + frac{y^{2}}{3} = 1 end{cases}, we eliminate y and get (3 + 4k^{2})x^{2} + 8kmx + 4m^{2} - 12 = 0.

The equation of circle M is ____.","completion":"To find the equation of circle M, we start by identifying the coordinates of point M that lies on the line 2x+y-1=0. We can express the coordinates of M in terms of a single variable, say a, so M has coordinates (a, 1-2a). Given that points (3,0) and (0,1) lie on circle M, we can use these points to find the radius of the circle. The distance formula, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in the respective coordinates, gives us the radius of the circle when applied to the center M(a, 1-2a) and any point on the circle. For point (3,0), the distance to M is: [ sqrt{(a-3)^2 + (1-2a-0)^2} ] For point (0,1), the distance to M is: [ sqrt{(a-0)^2 + (1-2a-1)^2} ] Since both distances represent the radius of the same circle, we can set them equal to each other: [ sqrt{(a-3)^2 + (1-2a)^2} = sqrt{a^2 + (-2a)^2} ] Solving this equation for a, we find that a=1. Substituting a=1 back into the coordinates of M, we get M(1, -1). Therefore, the radius of the circle is sqrt{5}, calculated from either of the distances to points (3,0) or (0,1). The general equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2.

Let the number be denoted as N = 100x + 10y + z, where x, y, and z are the digits of N. We are looking for numbers such that: [ N = x! + y! + z! ] Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Digit Constraints:** We need to consider the factorial values of digits which lie between 0 and 9. However, since x, y, and z are the digits of a three-digit number, x neq 0. Also, note the factorial of 7 or greater would make a number more than three digits since 7! = 5040 is a four-digit number. Hence, x, y, and z must be less than or equal to 6. 2. **Initial Observations:** Since each digit cannot exceed 6, the maximum sum of factorials we need to consider is: [ 6! = 720 ] Thus, we can refine our number constraints further since N < 720. 3. **Further Refinement:** We now need to check combinations of digits that respect: [ x leq 6, quad y leq 6, quad z leq 6 ] and find if their factorials provide a three-digit number. After some trials, to shorten the time: 4. **Checking Specific Candidates:** We derive factorial values for all digits and manually check viable combinations: - 0! = 1 - 1! = 1 - 2! = 2 - 3! = 6 - 4! = 24 - 5! = 120 - 6! = 720 5. **Testing the viable candidates:** Given that 6 is already too large as the factorial (720), let us check combinations where one of the digits is 5 and sum remains within the three-digit range. 6. **Combining Factorials to Match N:** - Assume N = 145 (since 1, 4, and 5 factorial values within acceptable ranges). Calculate to verify: [ 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145 ] Thus, our conjecture matches the condition N = 145.

We are asked to find how many prime numbers exist among the four-digit numbers whose digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4 in some order. 2. To determine a number's primality, we only need to test its divisibility by prime numbers whose squares do not exceed the number itself. 3. Only arrangements ending in 1 or 3 need to be considered because any number ending in 2 or 4 is even and hence not a prime number. 4.

Consequently, the arc ( B_1 C_1 ) is also constant, meaning that both the length of chord ( B_1 C_1 ) and the distance from it to the center of the circle ( Omega_2 ) are constant. 6. **Height of the Pyramid ( M A_1 B_1 C_1 )**: - Prove that (M O_1) is the height of the pyramid (M A_1 B_1 C_1). - Notice that point ( O ), the projection of ( O_1 ) onto the plane ( M B_1 C_1 ), is the center of the circumscribed circle of triangle ( B_1 M C_1 ). By Lemma 1, ( M O perp B_1 C_1 ). - Considering the perpendicularity of ( O_1 O ) and ( B_1 C_1 ), we have ( (M O_1 O) perp B_1 C_1 ), implying that ( (M O_1 O) ) is perpendicular to ( (A_1 B_1 C_1) ). Consequently, the height of the pyramid lies in the plane ( (M_1 O) ). 7. **Plane and Section Analysis**: - The planes ( (M O_1 O_2) ) and ( (A_1 B_1 C_1) ) are perpendicular. - Consider the section ( M O_1 O_2 ). It passes through the centers of the spheres, intersecting them along great circles. Therefore, for any position of point ( M ), these pairs of circles align by rotation around the axis ( O_1 O_2 ). - Since this section is perpendicular to the plane ( A_1 B_1 C_1 ), let ( O_2 K ) be the perpendicular dropped onto the plane ( (A_1 B_1 C_1) ). - This implies ( O_2 K perp (A_1 B_1 C_1) ), and therefore, ( O_2 K ) lies in the plane ( (M O_1 O_2) ).

Denote the size of ( X ) as ( |X| = k ). - By construction, ( X ) satisfies condition (1). 4. **Investigate the Complement ( Y ):** - Let ( Y = I setminus X ). Because ( X ) is not equal to ( I ), ( Y ) is non-empty. - Let ( Y = {y_1, y_2, ldots, y_{n-k}} ). 5. **Establishing the Function ( f ):** - For any ( y_i in Y ), by the maximality of ( X ), there exists at least one ( 3 )-element subset ( A_i ) of ( I ) such that ( A_i subseteq X cup {y_i} ) and ( A_i notsubseteq X ). - Hence, there exist ( x_{i_1}, x_{i_2} in X ) such that ( A_i = {x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}, y_i} ). 6. **Mapping ( y_i ) to ( {x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}} ):** - Define a mapping ( f: Y to binom{X}{2} ) such that ( f(y_i) = {x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}} ). 7. **Prove ( f ) is Injective:** - Suppose ( f(y_i) = f(y_j) = {x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}} = {x_{j_1}, x_{j_2}} ). - This would imply that ( A_i = {x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}, y_i} ) and ( A_j = {x_{j_1}, x_{j_2}, y_j} ) would share two elements ( x_{i_1} ) and ( x_{i_2} ), contradicting the condition that any two elements of ( mathscr{A} ) have at most one element in common. - Hence, ( f ) must be injective. 8. **Cardinality Comparison:** - Since ( f ) is injective, ( |Y| leq |binom{X}{2}| ). - That is, ( n - k leq binom{k}{2} = frac{k(k-1)}{2} ). 9. **Solving for ( k ):** - Simplify the inequality: ( 2(n-k) leq k(k-1) ), yielding ( k^2 - k - 2n + 2k geq 0 ). Thus, ( k^2 + k geq 2n ). - Solving for ( k ): ( k geq sqrt{2n} - 1 ). - Taking the ceiling, we get ( k geq [sqrt{2n}] ). 10. **Conclusion:** - Hence, ( |X| = k geq [sqrt{2n}] ). Thus, there exists a subset ( X ) of ( I ) such that (|X| geq [sqrt{2n}]) and satisfying conditions (1) and (2).

Therefore, 12 ships will occupy: [ 12 times 4 = 48 quad text{square units} ] 2. **Total Area of the Board:** The entire 10 times 10 board has: [ 10 times 10 = 100 quad text{square units} ] 3. **Spacing Requirement:** Our goal is to arrange these ships such that none of the ships touch each other, not even at corners. To achieve this, consider the spacing requirements. If we place a ship horizontally, we need to consider spacing the next ship at least one row and one column away. 4. **Example Board Arrangement:** Let's consider arranging the ships along every second row and column: - Place the first ship starting at row 1, column 1. - Next ship at row 1, column 3. - Continue this pattern along row 1. After filling up row 1 (with a maximum of 2 ships that do not touch), move to row 3 and repeat.

A Latin square of order n is an n times n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. 3. **Design an Arrangement**: Consider the 8 times 8 grid and fill it using a pattern analogous to a Latin square, varying the number of tokens per row. Here's how it can be achieved: - Row 1: Place tokens at positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8) — 8 tokens. - Row 2: Place tokens at positions (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2,7)— 7 tokens. - Row 3: Place tokens at positions (3,1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6) — 6 tokens. - Row 4: Place tokens at positions (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5) — 5 tokens. - Row 5: Place tokens at positions (5,1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4) — 4 tokens. - Row 6: Place tokens at positions (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3) — 3 tokens. - Row 7: Place tokens at positions (7, 1), (7, 2) — 2 tokens. - Row 8: Place tokens at positions (8, 1) — 1 token. 4. **Verification of Column Constraint**: By following this pattern: - Column 1: 8 tokens (one from each row). - Column 2: 7 tokens (excluding row 8). - Column 3: 6 tokens (excluding rows 7, 8). - Column 4: 5 tokens (excluding rows 6, 7, 8). - Column 5: 4 tokens (excluding rows 5, 6, 7, 8). - Column 6: 3 tokens (excluding rows 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). - Column 7: 2 tokens (excluding rows 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). - Column 8: 1 token (excluding rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). In each scenario, the spacing effectively ensures that each pair of columns will invariably hold the same number of tokens, owing to the methodical decrement in each column between subsequent rows. 5. **Conclusion**: Hence, it can be deduced from the structured placement of tokens on the grid that the conditions stated in the problem can indeed be satisfied.

Step 1: Find the coordinates of the focus of the parabola y^2 = 12x. The focus of a parabola of the form y^2 = 4px is (p, 0). Comparing this with y^2 = 12x, we see that p = 3.

From the given information, we have: [ begin{align*} m + n &= 240 quad text{(3)} n &leq 3m quad text{(4)} end{align*} ] To minimize the cost, we need to find the minimum value of a, where: [ a = 100m + 30n ] Substituting n = 240 - m into the cost equation, we get: [ a = 100m + 30(240 - m) = 70m + 7200 ] Since the cost a increases with m, to minimize a, we need to minimize m. From the constraint n leq 3m, and knowing m + n = 240, we find that m geq 60. Thus, at m = 60, the cost a is minimized: [ a = 70 times 60 + 7200 = 11400 ] Therefore, the minimum amount the company will need to pay for waste disposal in 2023 is boxed{11400 text{ yuan}}."},{"prompt":"Given four points in space, _E_, _F_, _G_, and _H_, Proposition A: The four points _E_, _F_, _G_, and _H_ are not coplanar.

The asymptotes for this hyperbola are lines that the hyperbola approaches but never touches. For a hyperbola in this form, the asymptotes are given by y = pm frac{x}{m}. 2. **Determine the center and radius of the circle**: The circle's equation is x^{2}+y^{2}-4y+3=0. Completing the square for y gives us the circle's center and radius. The equation can be rewritten as x^2 + (y^2 - 4y + 4) = 1, which simplifies to x^2 + (y-2)^2 = 1. Thus, the center of the circle is (0, 2), and its radius is 1. 3. **Condition for tangency**: For the asymptotes of the hyperbola to be tangent to the circle, the distance from the center of the circle to the line (asymptote) must be equal to the radius of the circle. The distance from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. Applying this to one of the asymptotes y = mx and the center of the circle (0, 2), we get the distance as frac{|2m|}{sqrt{1+m^2}}. 4. **Solve for m**: Setting this distance equal to the radius of the circle, 1, gives us the equation frac{2m}{sqrt{1+m^2}} = 1. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives 4m^2 = 1 + m^2. Solving for m^2 yields m^2 = frac{1}{3}, so m = pm frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. Since m > 0, we discard the negative solution.

Since 2^{n+1} - 1 is the smallest number with at least n + 1 digits of 1's in binary form, it follows that r leq n. 3. **Sum Representation:** Notice that k can be written as a sum of r distinct powers of 2 because k is expressed in binary form. 4. **Induction start – The base case:** Suppose k divides a sum of i powers of 2. We must show that k also divides a sum of i+1 such powers. 5. **Adding another power of 2 to the sum:** Assume 2^l is one of these i powers where l > 0. Then rewrite 2^l as 2^{l-1} + 2^{l-1} and keep the remaining i - 1 powers the same.

Let's square the first equation to see if we can find a relationship: [ (dq + 3)^2 = d^2q^2 + 6dq + 9 ] We can see that ( d^2q^2 + 6dq ) is divisible by ( d ) since both terms contain ( d ) as a factor.

The possible positive divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. However, since the remainder when ( n ) is divided by ( d ) is 3, ( d ) cannot be 1 or 3 because the remainder must be less than the divisor.

By the Pythagorean theorem, we have: [ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ] 3. **Derivation from the Given Situation:** - Essentially, if the initial large square side (a + b) is subdivided such that it forms smaller right-angled triangles or squares that collectively cover the same area, the relationship should align with the Pythagorean theorem. 4. **Conclusion:** - From the Pythagorean relationship for the right triangle subdivided from the large square, where (a) and (b) are legs and (c) is the hypotenuse, the relationship between the areas of the resulting squares (formed by sides (a), (b), and (c)) can be written as: [ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ] Therefore, the correct representation of the shaded parts' areas in terms of (a), (b), and (c) is: [ boxed{c^2 = a^2 + b^2} ]"},{"prompt":"The center of ellipse Gamma is O, and line l does not intersect Gamma.

Similarly, [ y_Q = frac{y_P}{frac{x_P^2}{a^2} + frac{y_P^2}{b^2}}. ] 8. Since (x_P neq 0) implies (x_Q neq 0), the line (ell_P) is not parallel to the (y)-axis, and its equation can be written as [ y = kx + y_Q - kx_Q. ] 9.

Thus, within this subset of 5 people, there must be enough mutual acquaintance to satisfy the problem’s premise. 4. **Implication for the 5 Unknown Members**: - For these 5 people who are not known by ( P ): - Since any three people must include a pair who knows each other, let's indicate each pair within this group: ((P_1, P_2), (P_2, P_3), ..., (P_4, P_5)). - This implies that each person in this 5-person subset must know at least 4 others (among these 5), ensuring that each has 4 acquaintances within this smaller group. 5. **Combination and Conclusion**: - Therefore, no matter if all know at least 4 people or someone knows at most 3 people, there still exists a subset of at least 5 people in the society who each know at least 4 others within that subset. - This subset witnesses that every member has at least 4 connections within the group, ensuring the required condition is met. Consequently, we have successfully demonstrated that there are always at least 5 people in the society such that each person knows at least 4 of the others. Thus, the problem statement is proven.

We need to prove that there are no integers ( x, y, z ) such that: [ 2x^{4} + 2x^{2}y^{2} + y^{4} = z^{2} quad text{with} quad x neq 0 ] 2. Given ( x neq 0 ), it is evident that ( y neq 0 ). 3. Without loss of generality, assume ( x, y ) are integers that satisfy the equation with ( x > 0, y > 0 ), and (gcd(x, y) = 1). Additionally, assume ( x ) is the smallest positive integer that satisfies these conditions. 4. Since ( z^2 equiv 0, 1, 4 pmod{8} ), it follows that ( x ) must be odd (since even ( x ) would make ( 2x^4 equiv 0 pmod 8 ) yielding ( z^2 equiv y^4 pmod 8 ), and ( y ) must be odd to make ( y^4 equiv 1 pmod 8 )). Thus ( y ) is also necessarily odd. 5. Notice that we can rewrite the equation as: [ x^4 + left(x^2 + y^2right)^2 = z^2 ] 6. Because (gcd(x^2, x^2 + y^2) = 1), there exist coprime integers ( p ) and ( q ), one of which is odd and the other is even, such that: [ x^2 = 2pq, quad x^2 + y^2 = p^2 - q^2 quad text{with} quad gcd(p, q) = 1 ] 7. This implies that there exist integers ( a ) and ( b ) with ( b ) odd and ( a ) even, such that: [ p = b^2, quad q = 2a^2 ] 8. Substituting ( p ) and ( q ) back into our expressions for ( x ) and ( y ): [ x = 2ab, quad y^2 = b^4 - 4a^4 - 4a^2b^2 ] 9. Consider: [ left(frac{2a^2 + b^2 + y}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{2a^2 + b^2 - y}{2}right)^2 = b^4 ] with (gcdleft(frac{2a^2 + b^2 + y}{2}, frac{2a^2 + b^2 - y}{2}right) = 1). 10. Therefore, there exist integers ( s ) and ( t ), with ( s > t ) and (gcd(s, t) = 1), such that: [ frac{2a^2 + b^2 + y}{2} = 2st, quad frac{2a^2 + b^2 - y}{2} = s^2 - t^2 ] or [ frac{2a^2 + b^2 + y}{2} = s^2 - t^2, quad frac{2a^2 + b^2 - y}{2} = 2st ] and: [ b^2 = s^2 + t^2 ] 11. Now, notice: [ a^2 = (s - t)t ] 12. Since (gcd(a, b) = 1) and (gcd(s, t) = 1), there exist positive integers ( m ) and ( n ) (with (gcd(m, n) = 1)), such that: [ s - t = m^2, quad t = n^2 ] 13. Thus: [ b^2 = n^4 + (n^2 + m^2)^2 ] 14. Since ( x = 2ab > t = n^2 geq n ), this contradicts the assumption that ( x ) is the smallest solution.

Substituting this in, we get: [ cos^2(theta) + 2cos(theta) left( frac{sin(theta)}{cos(theta)} right) + left( frac{sin(theta)}{cos(theta)} right)^2 = cos^2(theta) + 2sin(theta) + frac{sin^2(theta)}{cos^2(theta)}. ] 8. By common denominator, the expression becomes: [ frac{cos^4(theta) + 2cos^2(theta) cdot sin(theta) + sin^2(theta)}{cos^2(theta)^2}. ] 9. Since the discriminant must equate to zero: [ left( cos(theta) + tan(theta) right)^2 - 4 sin(theta) = 0. ] 10. Verifying the possibility when (sin(theta) = 0), consider (sin(theta) = 0). The polynomial simplifies to: [ P(x) = (cos(theta) + 0)x + 1 = cos(theta)x + 1. ] If (cos(theta)) ≠ 0, (P(x)) is a linear polynomial which has exactly one real root. So, (sin(theta) = 0) is a solution. 11. Now, let us assume (sin(theta) neq 0), rewrite the polynomial (P(x)) as: [ (tan(theta)x + 1)(x + sec(theta)). ] Multiplying out the factors, we get: [ P(x) = tan(theta)x^2 + (1 + tan(theta)sec(theta)) x + sec(theta). ] From the given polynomial, the coefficients must match: [ sin(theta)x^2 + (cos(theta) + tan(theta))x + 1. ] 12. Set the condition for (P(x)) having only one real root: [ sec(theta) = frac{1}{tan(theta)}, quad text{or} quad sec(theta) cdot tan(theta) = 1. ] 13. Using the trigonometric identity (sec(theta) = frac{1}{cos(theta)}), we find: [ 1 = frac{sin(theta)}{cos^2(theta)}. ] Consequently, [ sin(theta) = cos^2(theta). ] Given (cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) = 1): [ sin(theta) + sin^2(theta) = 1 ] 14. Solve the quadratic in (sin(theta)): [ sin^2(theta) + sin(theta) - 1 = 0. ] By the quadratic formula: [ sin(theta) = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-1)}}{2 cdot 1} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 4}}{2 cdot 1} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{5}}{2} ] Out of which: [ sin(theta) = frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2} ] Therefore, the possible values of (sin(theta)) are: [ sin(theta) = 0 quad text{or} quad sin(theta) = frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2} ] 15.

According to the information given: Canada is 1.5 times bigger than the United States, so Canada's size is 1.5U. Russia is 2 times bigger than the United States, so Russia's size is 2U. To find out what fraction bigger Russia is than Canada, we need to compare the size of Russia to the size of Canada: Russia's size is 2U, and Canada's size is 1.5U. The difference in size between Russia and Canada is 2U - 1.5U = 0.5U. To find the fraction by which Russia is bigger than Canada, we divide the difference in size by the size of Canada: Fraction bigger = (Difference in size) / (Size of Canada) Fraction bigger = (0.5U) / (1.5U) When we divide 0.5U by 1.5U, the U's cancel out, and we are left with: Fraction bigger = 0.5 / 1.5 To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 0.5: Fraction bigger = (0.5 ÷ 0.5) / (1.5 ÷ 0.5) Fraction bigger = 1 / 3 Therefore, Russia is boxed{1/3} (one-third) bigger than Canada."},{"prompt":"What is the total molecular weight of 10 moles of Calcium iodide, 7 moles of Sodium chloride, and 15 moles of Potassium sulfate?","completion":"To calculate the total molecular weight of the given compounds, we first need to find the molecular weight of each compound and then multiply it by the number of moles given for each. 1.

The molecular weight of CaI2 = 40.08 g/mol (for Ca) + 2 * 126.90 g/mol (for I) = 40.08 g/mol + 253.80 g/mol = 293.88 g/mol. For 10 moles of CaI2: Total weight = 10 moles * 293.88 g/mol = 2938.8 g. 2.

We need to show that the existence of a positive integer alpha such that p mid alpha(alpha - 1) + 3 is equivalent to the existence of a positive integer beta such that p mid beta(beta - 1) + 25. 1. **Existence of alpha implies existence of beta:** - Given p mid alpha(alpha - 1) + 3, we can write: [ alpha(alpha - 1) + 3 equiv 0 pmod{p} ] [ alpha^2 - alpha + 3 equiv 0 pmod{p} ] This is a quadratic congruence in alpha. The solutions to this congruence can be found using the quadratic formula: [ alpha = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 - 4 cdot 3}}{2} = frac{1 pm sqrt{-11}}{2} ] For alpha to be an integer, sqrt{-11} must exist modulo p. This means -11 must be a quadratic residue modulo p. 2. **Existence of beta:** - We need to show that if sqrt{-11} exists modulo p, then there exists a beta such that p mid beta(beta - 1) + 25. We can write: [ beta(beta - 1) + 25 equiv 0 pmod{p} ] [ beta^2 - beta + 25 equiv 0 pmod{p} ] Using the quadratic formula again: [ beta = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 - 4 cdot 25}}{2} = frac{1 pm sqrt{-99}}{2} = frac{1 pm 3sqrt{-11}}{2} ] Since sqrt{-11} exists modulo p, 3sqrt{-11} also exists modulo p. Therefore, beta exists. 3. **Reciprocal:** - Suppose there exists a positive integer beta such that p mid beta(beta - 1) + 25. Then: [ beta^2 - beta + 25 equiv 0 pmod{p} ] [ beta = frac{1 pm sqrt{-99}}{2} = frac{1 pm 3sqrt{-11}}{2} ] Since sqrt{-11} exists modulo p, we can find alpha such that: [ alpha = frac{1 pm sqrt{-11}}{2} ] Thus, p mid alpha(alpha - 1) + 3. 4. **Special case p = 3:** - For p = 3, we can check manually: [ alpha(alpha - 1) + 3 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] [ alpha^2 - alpha + 3 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] Testing alpha = 1, 2: [ 1^2 - 1 + 3 equiv 3 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] [ 2^2 - 2 + 3 equiv 4 - 2 + 3 equiv 5 equiv 2 pmod{3} ] Only alpha = 1 works.

By the pigeonhole principle, we can find ( x_0, y_0 in mathbb{Z} ) such that: [ min frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 - C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} leq frac{1}{2} left( frac{|d cdot lfloor frac{C}{d} rfloor - C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} + frac{|d cdot lceil frac{C}{d} rceil - C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} right) ] Simplifying, we get: [ frac{d}{2sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} leq frac{d}{2sqrt{d^2 + d^2}} = frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} ] 6. **Conclusion**: Since we have shown both the lower bound and that the distance can be achieved, the minimal distance ( d ) is indeed ( frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} ).

Differentiating, we find y'= frac {1}{2}x. Thus, the slope of line PA is frac {1}{2}x_{1}. Since points A(x_{1},y_{1}) and B(x_{2},y_{2}) lie on the parabola C, we have y= frac {1}{4}x_{1}^{2} and y= frac {1}{4}x_{2}^{2}. Therefore, the equation of line PA is y- frac {1}{4}x_{1}^{2}= frac {1}{2}x_{1}(x-x_{1}). Since point P(a,-2) lies on line PA, we have -2- frac {1}{4}x_{1}^{2}= frac {1}{2}x_{1}(a-x_{1}), which simplifies to x_{1}^{2}-2ax_{1}-8=0. Similarly, x_{2}^{2}-2ax_{2}-8=0.

First, let's find out how many vegan cupcakes are gluten-free: Half of 24 vegan cupcakes are gluten-free, so that's 24 / 2 = 12 gluten-free vegan cupcakes. Now, let's find out the total number of gluten-free cupcakes: Since half of the total cupcakes are gluten-free and we know that 12 vegan cupcakes are gluten-free, we can deduce that the gluten-free vegan cupcakes make up half of all the gluten-free cupcakes.

Given the conditions, we can set up two equations based on the scenarios provided: 1. When 2 checkout counters are open, it takes 20 minutes to clear the line. The total number of people checked out in this time is equal to the increase in the number of people plus the initial number of people in line, n. This gives us the equation: [20 cdot 2x = 20y + n] 2. When 3 checkout counters are open, it takes 12 minutes to clear the line. Similarly, the total number of people checked out in this time is equal to the increase in the number of people plus the initial number of people in line, n. This gives us the equation: [12 cdot 3x = 12y + n] Let's solve these equations step by step: First, simplify both equations: [40x = 20y + n] [36x = 12y + n] Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate n and solve for x and y: [40x - 36x = 20y - 12y] [4x = 8y] [x = 2y] From the original equations, we can substitute x = 2y into either one to find the relationship between x and n or y and n. Let's use the first equation for simplicity: [40 cdot 2y = 20y + n] [80y = 20y + n] [60y = n] Therefore, we have x = 2y and 60y = n. To find the ratio of x to y, we substitute y = frac{n}{60} into x = 2y: [x = 2 cdot frac{n}{60}] [x = frac{n}{30}] Thus, y = frac{n}{60} and x = frac{n}{30}. The ratio of the cashier's checkout speed to the rate at which the number of people waiting to check out increases is: [frac{x}{y} = frac{frac{n}{30}}{frac{n}{60}} = frac{60}{30} = 2] Therefore, the cashier's checkout speed is 2 times the rate at which the number of people waiting to check out increases.

We know that the cost for up to 120 units is 420 yuan, and the cost for up to 300 units (without exceeding it) is 996 yuan. Given Xiaoming spent 740 yuan, which lies between 420 and 996, it implies that 120 < x < 300. The cost equation for this range is: [120 times 3.5 + 3.2 times (x-120) = 740] Solving this equation for x gives: [x = 220] Therefore, Xiaoming bought boxed{220 text{units}} of the gift.

Therefore, Xiaowang bought 400 - x = 110 units. This solution satisfies the given conditions. - **Case 2: When x > 300:** The equation for the total cost changes to: [120 times 3.5 + 3.2 times (300-120) + 3 times (x-300) + 3.5 times (400-x) = 1349] Solving this equation gives x = 294, which does not satisfy the initial conditions of the problem.

Show that there exists a row vector x with integer entries such that no entry of xM is 0pmod{p} . (translated by L. Erdős)","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a prime number ( p ) and an ( n times m ) matrix ( M ) with integer entries. The condition ( Mv notequiv 0 pmod{p} ) for any column vector ( v neq 0 ) whose entries are ( 0 ) or ( 1 ) means that for any such vector ( v ), the product ( Mv ) does not result in a vector where all entries are divisible by ( p ). 2. **Objective:** We need to show that there exists a row vector ( x ) with integer entries such that no entry of ( xM ) is ( 0 pmod{p} ). 3. **Constructing the Row Vector ( x ):** Consider the matrix ( M ) modulo ( p ). Let ( M_p ) be the matrix obtained by reducing each entry of ( M ) modulo ( p ). The condition ( Mv notequiv 0 pmod{p} ) implies that for any non-zero vector ( v ) with entries in ( {0, 1} ), the product ( M_p v ) is not the zero vector. 4. **Linear Independence:** The vectors ( v ) with entries in ( {0, 1} ) span a subspace of ( mathbb{F}_p^m ). The condition ( Mv notequiv 0 pmod{p} ) implies that the columns of ( M_p ) are linearly independent over ( mathbb{F}_p ). Therefore, ( M_p ) has full column rank, meaning that the rank of ( M_p ) is ( m ). 5. **Existence of the Row Vector ( x ):** Since ( M_p ) has full column rank, its transpose ( M_p^T ) has full row rank. This implies that there exists a row vector ( x ) such that ( xM_p ) has no zero entries modulo ( p ). In other words, for each column ( j ) of ( M_p ), the dot product ( x cdot M_p^j notequiv 0 pmod{p} ). 6. **Conclusion:** The row vector ( x ) with integer entries exists such that no entry of ( xM ) is ( 0 pmod{p} ).

Perpendiculars are dropped from these midpoints to the other sides forming smaller triangles within the larger triangle. 2. **Triangles with Perpendiculars**: The segments from A_1, B_1, and C_1 to the sides CA, AB, and BC are heights in the newly formed triangles AB_1C_1, A_1BC_1, and A_1B_1C. 3. **Intersection Points**: Let P, Q, and R be the points where these perpendiculars intersect. The point O is the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle A_1B_1C_1. 4. **Hexagon Formation**: The hexagonal region of interest consists of the triangle A_1B_1C_1 and three additional triangles, B_1C_1P, C_1A_1Q, and A_1B_1R. 5. **Area Equivalence**: It is evident that: - triangle B_1C_1P cong triangle C_1B_1O, - triangle C_1A_1Q cong triangle A_1C_1O, and - triangle A_1B_1R cong triangle B_1A_1O. Each of these pairs of triangles has the same area because they share the height and base from the same point of intersection of the altitudes and the midpoints of the sides. 6. **Area Calculation**: Since the area of each of these small triangles matches the area of their corresponding components, the total area of the hexagon is precisely twice the area of triangle A_1B_1C_1. Let S_{ABC} be the area of the original triangle ABC and S_{A_1B_1C_1} be the area of the triangle formed by the midpoints. 7. **Area Relationship**: The area S_{A_1B_1C_1} of the triangle formed by the midpoints of the sides of triangle ABC is frac{1}{4} of the area of triangle ABC.

Considering how the star is formed by connecting every fourth point: - angle ACE now spans five points from (A) to (E) directly. Hence, it cuts off 4 arcs between (A) and (E), totaling (4 times 40^circ = 160^circ). - The exterior angle ( alpha ) at one tip of the star is thus formed by an arc spanning (160^circ). But since ( alpha) is an exterior angle, it is calculated as (360^circ - 160^circ = 200^circ). - The angle at the tip of the star (interior angle) is complementary to the exterior angle, so it's (360^circ - 200^circ = 160^circ).

The area ( S_1 ) is obtained by subtracting twice the area of the small triangle ( triangle AOP ) from the area of the sector ( AOF ). 5.

Prove that the external common tangents of the circles omega_{1} and omega_{2} intersect on the circle omega.","completion":"To prove the problem, we begin by addressing the lemma. Suppose in the convex quadrilateral (ABCD), the circle (omega) exists such that it touches the extension of ray (BA) beyond point (A) and the extension of ray (BC) beyond point (C), as well as the lines (AD) and (CD). Lemma: If such a circle (omega) exists, then the equality [ AB + AD = BC + CD ] holds. Proof of the Lemma: Let the points of tangency of the circle (omega) with the lines (BA), (BC), (AD), and (CD) be (T_1), (T_2), (T_3), and (T_4) respectively. By the tangent-segment theorem, the lengths of the tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal. Thus, we have: [ BT_4 = BT_1 ] Using this property, we can chain together a series of equalities: [ begin{aligned} BT_4 & = BT_1 & = BC + CT_4 & = BC + CT_2 & = BC + CD + DT_2 & = BC + CD + DT_3 & = BC + CD + AT_3 - AD & = BC + CD + AT_1 - AD & = BC + CD + AB - AD end{aligned} ] After comparing this with the initial equality ( BT_4 = BT_1 ), it follows that: [ BC + CD + AB - AD = 0 ] Rearranging terms gives us: [ AB + AD = BC + CD ] Thus, the lemma is proved. (blacksquare) Proof of the Main Problem: Given that (omega_1) and (omega_2) are the incircles of triangles (ABC) and (ADC) respectively. We need to prove that their common external tangents intersect on the circle (omega). 1. Draw the circle (omega_1) with an auxiliary tangent parallel to side (AC) and let it be tangent at point (E'). The points where (omega_1) and (omega_2) touch (AC) be (E) and (F) respectively. 2. Draw the tangent to the circle (omega) parallel to (AC) that separates (B) from (omega), and let it touch (omega) at point (H). By the known relationships involving circle tangents, [ CE = frac{-AB + BC + CA}{2} quad text{and} quad AF = frac{-CD + AD + AC}{2} ] Using the lemma ( CE = AF ), it indicates that (F) is the tangency point of the incircle of (triangle ABC) with (AC). 3. By extending the line from (B) through (E') to (A) on (AC), we see that (E') coincides with (F). Consequently, points (B, E', F, H) are collinear. 4. Let (H') be the intersection of the common external tangents of (omega_1) and (omega_2). By dilation transformations (magnifying (omega_2) to (omega_1)), point (F) maps to (E'), thus guaranteeing that (H', F, E') are collinear. By extending this argument, as point (H') lies on the external tangent structures of both (omega_1) and (omega_2), it follows that: [ H', H, B, D, E ] are collinear. Since lines through different transformations illustrate these intersections are unique and coincide, the original construction maintains that ( H = H'). This ultimately means (H'), the intersection of the external tangents coincides with (H), the point on the circle (omega). Thus, we conclude the proof by showing the intersection point of the tangents from (omega_1) and (omega_2) lies on circle (omega).

Every possible team (except the team consisting of all students) participated in exactly one round. 4. We need to prove that in each round, all students of the school participated. To tackle this problem, consider the following points: 1. **Complementary Teams:** - We call two teams complementary if one team consists of all students not in the other team. If a team ( A ) (with ( |A| ) students) played against a team ( B ), which consists of students who are not in ( A ), then ( B ) is the complement of ( A ) with ( |B| = N - |A| ). 2. **Participation of Each Student:** - Each student belongs to exactly one of the two complementary teams in each round. Therefore, if team ( A ) and its complement ( B ) from a round, each student is accounted for in one of these two teams. 3. **Counting Rounds and Participants:** - Note that the total number of non-empty subsets (teams) of ( N ) students is ( 2^N - 1 ), which includes all possible teams except the empty set. - Given the condition that each possible team except the full group of ( N ) students participated in exactly one round, it means we are counting ( frac{2^N - 1}{2} ) rounds, because each pair ( (A, B) ) is essentially counted twice. 4. **Combining the Points:** - Since every student is a member of one of the teams in each complementary pair, and every possible team except the full ( N ) has its complement, the only way this can consistently apply for exactly one round per subset is if every round's two teams together make up all ( N ) students. 5. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, every round's teams are exhaustive across all students, meaning every student must have participated in every round, spread across the two complementary teams. Hence, it ensures that all students participated in every round.

Winning Strategy for the First Player: - If before the first player's move, the set of stones satisfies the equality and odd number (k): [ r_1 oplus r_2 oplus ldots oplus r_k = 1 ] The first player should make a move such that the new nim-sum (n') equals 0 after their move. - The player should adjust one of the piles to make the nim-sum 0.

This means that the total amount of provisions available is enough to feed 2000 men for 54 days. The total provisions at the start can be calculated as: Total provisions = Number of men × Number of days Total provisions = 2000 men × 54 days Total provisions = 108,000 man-days After 21 days, the provisions left would be enough for the remaining 33 days for 2000 men. So, the provisions left after 21 days would be: Provisions left = 2000 men × 33 days Provisions left = 66,000 man-days Now, 1300 men are added to the garrison, making the total number of men 3300 (2000 original + 1300 reinforcement). The provisions left (66,000 man-days) need to be divided by the new total number of men to find out for how many more days the provisions will last: New duration = Provisions left / New number of men New duration = 66,000 man-days / 3300 men New duration = 20 days Therefore, with the reinforcement, the provisions will last for boxed{20} more days."},{"prompt":"Given 10 points P_{1}, P_{2}, cdots, P_{10} on a plane, prove that max _{1 leqslant i<j leqslant 10} P_{i} P_{j} geqslant 2 min _{1 leqslant i<j leqslant 10} P_{i} P_{j}.","completion":"We need to show that for 10 given points ( P_1, P_2, dots, P_{10} ) on a plane, the maximum distance between any two points among them is at least twice the minimum distance between any two points. Formally, we need to prove: [ max_{1 leq i < j leq 10} P_i P_j geq 2 min_{1 leq i < j leq 10} P_i P_j ] **Step-by-Step Proof:** 1. **Identify Maximum Distance**: Assume without loss of generality that ( P_1 P_2 = max_{1 leq i < j leq 10} P_i P_j ). 2. **Form Square**: Construct a square with side length ( P_1 P_2 ). This square will encompass all 10 points either within its interior or on its boundary. 3. **Construct Perpendicular Lines**: Draw lines ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) perpendicular to ( P_1 P_2 ) passing through points ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ), respectively. This arrangement ensures that the remaining points ( P_3, P_4, ldots, P_{10} ) lie between ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) or on these lines. 4. **Maximize Distance on Opposite Sides**: Let ( P_3 ) be the farthest point from ( P_1 ) on one side of ( P_1 P_2 ) and ( P_4 ) the farthest point from ( P_2 ) on the opposite side. Construct lines ( l_3 ) and ( l_4 ) parallel to ( P_1 P_2 ) passing through ( P_3 ) and ( P_4 ) respectively. 5. **Bounding Rectangle**: The lines ( l_1, l_2, l_3, ) and ( l_4 ) form a rectangle that bounds all 10 points. The distance between ( l_3 ) and ( l_4 ) is less than or equal to the distance between ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ). 6. **Square Construction and Division**: Slide ( l_4 ) to form a perfect square of side length ( P_1 P_2 ) which will now cover all the 10 points. 7. **Smaller Squares and Pigeonhole Principle**: Divide this larger square into 9 smaller equal squares each with side length ( frac{P_1 P_2}{3} ). By the pigeonhole principle, with 10 points and only 9 smaller squares, at least one smaller square must contain at least two of the 10 points. 8. **Distance Calculation**: The maximum distance between any two points inside a smaller square cannot exceed the diagonal of the smaller square, which is ( sqrt{2} cdot frac{P_1 P_2}{3} ). [ d_{text{max in small square}} leq sqrt{2} cdot frac{P_1 P_2}{3} ] Given that ( sqrt{2} < 1.5 ), [ sqrt{2} cdot frac{P_1 P_2}{3} < frac{P_1 P_2}{2} ] Hence, the distance between at least one pair of points within one small square is less than ( frac{P_1 P_2}{2} ). 9. **Conclusion**: This implies that the minimum distance ( min_{1 leq i < j leq 10} P_i P_j ) is less than or equal to ( frac{P_1 P_2}{2} ). Therefore, we conclude: [ max_{1 leq i < j leq 10} P_i P_j geq 2 min_{1 leq i < j leq 10} P_i P_j ] This completes our proof.

Setting f'(x) = 0 gives x = frac{1}{2}. For 0 < x < frac{1}{2}, f'(x) < 0, indicating f(x) is decreasing. For x geq frac{1}{2}, f'(x) > 0, indicating f(x) is increasing.

At this step, you will always end up with one unpaired point that you will add to the next group until only one group of four points and one group of five points remain. 7. **Final Pairing**: Perform the operation one last time for the remaining five points, and you end up with two final points left.

Because they make up everything!"},{"prompt":"Describe and discuss modern theories of leadership.What is the difference between successful and an effective leader?Explian with examples in400 words","completion":"Modern theories of leadership focus on the idea that leadership is not solely based on one's individual traits or characteristics but rather the ability to adapt and respond to different situations and followers. These theories emphasize that leadership is a dynamic process that involves the interaction between the leader, followers, and the context in which they operate. One modern theory of leadership is the transformational leadership theory. This theory suggests that leaders inspire and motivate their followers to achieve higher levels of performance by creating a vision, setting goals, and providing support and guidance. Transformational leaders are known for their ability to increase followers' self-beliefs, engagement, and commitment to the organization. They often use charisma, vision, and intellectual stimulation to inspire others around them. For example, leaders like Steve Jobs of Apple and Nelson Mandela are often regarded as transformational leaders as they were able to inspire and motivate their followers to achieve extraordinary results. Another modern theory of leadership is the situational leadership theory. This theory posits that effective leadership depends on the ability of leaders to adapt their style and behavior to suit the demands of the situation and the needs of their followers. According to this theory, leaders must assess the readiness level of their followers and adjust their leadership style accordingly. For example, a leader may need to provide clear and specific instructions to a follower who is inexperienced and lacks confidence, while providing more autonomy to a follower who is experienced and highly motivated. This theory suggests that effective leaders are those who can accurately diagnose the situation and adjust their leadership style accordingly. The difference between a successful and an effective leader lies in the outcomes they achieve and the impact they have on their followers and the organization. A successful leader is often measured by the attainment of goals and objectives, such as increased profits or market share. They are able to deliver results and achieve tangible outcomes for their organization. However, an effective leader goes beyond just achieving goals and focuses on building and developing their followers and organization in the long term. Effective leaders are known for their ability to inspire, motivate, and empower their followers. They create a positive and inclusive work environment and foster innovation and growth. While successful leaders may be able to achieve short-term results, it is the effective leaders who are able to bring out the best in their followers and create long-lasting positive change. In conclusion, modern theories of leadership emphasize the dynamic nature of leadership and the importance of adapting to different situations and followers. Transformational leadership and situational leadership are two examples of modern theories that highlight the different aspects of effective leadership. While successful leaders may achieve short-term results, effective leaders go beyond just achieving goals and focus on building and developing their followers and organization in the long term."},{"prompt":"4.Describe different types of managerial decisions and the techniques used for decision making.Discuss Individual Vs Group decision making in 350 words","completion":"There are various types of managerial decisions that managers make on a regular basis in order to achieve organizational objectives. These decisions can range from routine operational decisions to complex strategic decisions. The techniques used for decision-making depend on the type of decision being made and the context in which it is taking place. Some common types of managerial decisions and respective decision-making techniques are: 1. Operational Decisions: These decisions are routine and repetitive, typically made by lower-level managers. They involve day-to-day activities and processes within the organization. Techniques used for operational decision-making include standard operating procedures, rules and regulations, and data-driven analysis. 2. Tactical Decisions: Tactical decisions are made by middle-level managers and are related to the implementation of organizational strategies. These decisions are concerned with allocating resources and coordinating activities to achieve specific objectives. Techniques used for tactical decision-making include SWOT analysis, cost-benefit analysis, and critical path analysis. 3. Strategic Decisions: Strategic decisions are made by top-level managers and are focused on long-term success and direction of the organization. These decisions involve major changes and have a significant impact on the organization's future. Techniques used for strategic decision-making include scenario planning, strategic analysis (e.g., Porter's Five Forces), and strategic planning frameworks (e.g., BCG matrix). 4. Programmed Decisions: Programmed decisions are repetitive and routine decisions that are made in response to frequently encountered problems or situations. These decisions are usually made using predetermined rules and procedures. 5. Non-programmed Decisions: Non-programmed decisions are unique and significant decisions that require a higher level of judgment and analysis. These decisions are often made in response to new and complex situations or problems that do not have pre-established procedures or solutions. Individual decision-making refers to the process in which a single manager or leader makes decisions on their own. This approach allows for quick decision-making and enables the individual to take personal responsibility for the outcome. However, individual decision-making may be limited by biases, lack of diverse perspectives, and a limited range of knowledge and expertise. Group decision-making, on the other hand, involves multiple individuals working collaboratively to make a decision. Group decision-making allows for the incorporation of different viewpoints, diverse expertise, and collective intelligence. It can result in more creative and innovative solutions and greater acceptance and commitment to the decision. However, group decision-making can also be time-consuming, prone to conflicts and disagreements, and subject to conformity and groupthink. In conclusion, managerial decisions include operational, tactical, and strategic decisions, which require different decision-making techniques. Programmed decisions use predetermined rules, while non-programmed decisions require judgment and analysis. Individual decision-making allows for quick decisions but may be limited in perspective, while group decision-making incorporates diverse viewpoints but can be more time-consuming and prone to conformity. The choice between individual and group decision-making depends on the nature of the decision, the context, and the desired outcome."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Its piercing eyes, glimmering like diamonds, lock on to its surroundings, while its elongated form weaves through narrow alleyways and towering skyscrapers, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. The panicked crowd scrambles for safety, their faces contorted with terror, as the colossal serpent gracefully navigates the cityscape. The city itself is a sprawling metropolis, its concrete jungle adorned with towering buildings, bustling streets, and vibrant signs. Neon lights flash overhead, illuminating the chaos in an eerie and captivating glow. The sidewalks are packed with people, their diverse forms and expressions reflecting a tapestry of emotions - shock, disbelief, and sheer terror. The cacophony of honking horns, panicked shouts, and sirens fills the air, creating an overwhelming sense of urgency and impending doom.

The buildings and streets act as a stark backdrop, their sharp edges and rigid structures providing a striking contrast to the snake's natural elegance.

The desert environment stretches infinitely in all directions, an undulating sea of golden sand that seems to shimmer and shift in the intensifying heat. Towering sand dunes, sculpted by the wind, create a captivating play of light and shadow as the sun casts its rays upon them. The sparse vegetation that clings to life in this harsh environment consists of resilient cacti and hardy desert flowers, their vibrant blooms offering stark contrast to the barren landscape. The air is thick with a dry heat and the soft hiss of sand being carried by the wind, adding to the feeling of isolation and desolation. Compositions within the image ingeniously balance the mesmerizing serpent and the vast desert landscape. The serpent's sinuous form winds its way through the undulating sand dunes, taking on forms that mirror the natural curves and peaks of the landscape.

The resulting image would convey a sense of both serenity and unease, as the tranquility of the desert is momentarily disrupted by a creature that seems to belong to another world. The mood and atmosphere of the scene are imbued with a surreal and mystical quality. The desert, with its vast expanse and otherworldly beauty, evokes a sense of awe and insignificance.

The radiant presence of the serpent, with its jeweled scales and ethereal movement, adds an element of intrigue and wonder to the scene, leaving the viewer with a heightened sense of curiosity and a feeling of encountering something extraordinary within the barrenness of the desert. To realize this prompt, a style reminiscent of sculpture would be ideal.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"translate the following paragraphs into Chinese. This study describes the linguistic differences between the discourse of truth and discourse whose objective is to mislead.1 The intention to mislead arouses cognitive and emotional functions in the speaker that affect his speech. An examination of the linguistic characteristics that distinguish between the discourse of truth and that of invention among 48 native Hebrew speakers whowere asked to tell both true and invented stories found 13 criteria that differentiate between the two types of discourse. The criteria were classified according to the cognitive and emotional functions affecting the speaker, also addressing his level of awareness of these functions. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the linguistic examination in differentiating between truth and deception. This effectiveness is due to the uncontrollable psychological processes that cause differences between the discourse of truth and invention. The results may enable us to construct an instrument for linguistic examination to differentiate between the two types of discourse . 1. Introduction: psychology of deception The discourse of deception is discourse whose purpose is to deceive the listener. This definition is drawn from the American Heritage Dictionary’s definition of the verb deceive as ‘‘to delude, mislead,’’ with the following elaboration: ‘‘Deceive involves falsehood or the deliberate concealment or misrepresentation of truth with intent to lead another into error or to disadvantage’’ (1969:342). The reality described in a deception can be true, but be intended to mislead the listener, such as in the presentation of only part of a situation or taking words out of their context. This is unlike an outright lie, in which the reality presented is by definition unreal or distorted. In this article I will show which linguistic criteria differentiate between the discourse of truth and of invention, I will discuss the cognitive and emotional processes affecting the language of invention, and I will show that since the speaker cannot control these processes, it is pragmatically worthwhile to use the linguistic examination to distinguish between truth and deception.","completion":"本研究描述了真实话语和误导性话语之间的语言差异。故意误导会引发发言者的认知和情感功能，影响其言辞。对48名以色列本土人的语言特征进行了检查，这些人被要求讲述真实和虚构的故事，结果发现了13个区分这两种话语的标准。这些标准根据影响发言者的认知和情感功能进行了分类，并涉及其对这些功能的意识水平。本文的目的是证明通过语言检查可以有效区分真相和欺骗。这种效果是由于不可控的心理过程引起真相和虚构之间的差异。研究结果可能使我们能够构建一种用于语言检查的工具，以区分这两种话语类型。 1. 引言：欺骗心理 欺骗性话语是目的在于欺骗听者的话语。这个定义是从美国传统词典对动词“欺骗”一词的定义中得出的，其中有以下阐述：“欺骗涉及虚假或有意隐藏或歪曲真相，意图引导他人产生错误或处于不利地位”(1969:342)。欺骗中描述的现实可以是真实的，但意图是误导听者，比如只展示一个情景的一部分或把话语断章取义。这不同于直接的谎言，直接的谎言是指所呈现的现实在定义上是虚假或扭曲的。 在本文中，我将展示区分真实话语和虚构话语的语言标准，探讨影响虚构语言的认知和情感过程，并证明由于发言者无法控制这些过程，因此在语言检查中区分真相和欺骗是有实用意义的。"},{"prompt":"translate the following paragraphs into Chinese. The desire to expose the psychological processes involved in the act of intentional deception and the search for practical tools to improve our ability to identify a fabrication have led the way to some very productive research in this area. A number of studies dealing with the psychological motivations behind lying or deception have addressed the speaker’s functioning in this situation. Davis (1961) says that an individual will show a strong psychological response when he lies, because he fears the consequences when the lie is discovered. Elad (1988), who studies polygraph examinations, bases his work on the opinion of Davis and presents three theories that may explain why the person who is lying gives himself away: A. The conditioned response theory—this theory addresses examinations or questions, the responses to which are lies. The questions produce a stimulus that arouses an emotional response related to events from the subject’s past. The more traumatic these events were, the stronger the response will be. B. The conflict theory—this theory assumes that considerable physiological disturbances occur when the two possible options for a person’s response are in conflict with each other; for example, the basic inclination to tell the truth and a one-time inclination to lie regarding a certain subject. Here it seems that the greater the effort that the subject makes to conceal the information, the easier it will be to expose him. C. The theory of punishment or of the threat of punishment—according to this theory, an individual will have a stronger physiological response when lying because he expects severe consequences to befall him if the lie is found out. In this case, it is the fear that is the factor behind the response. This theory is consistent with the theory of the threat of punishment presented by Gustafson and Orne (1963).

The Story of a Bridge When I was young, I always thought that it would take a long time from my home in the north to the dance class in the south, long enough for my mother to do my hair and change my clothes in the car and eat the ice cream in my hands. After studying abroad and coming home, I found that from the north city to the South city is very close, and I did not wait for Jay Chou in my headphones to finish singing this song, and I reached the destination. And that bridge, ----漪汾, has made all the difference. In my impression, 漪汾 bridge has always been a symbol of harmony, not only because it fits in well with the slow-flowing Fen River beneath it, but also because of the harmonious atmosphere of our family driving on the unimpeded road. At night 漪汾 bridge is like a channel to another world. The warm yellow lights on the Fen River reflect it like the starry sky in the sky sinking into the water. It is quiet, beautiful and complementary. When I was driving on the 漪汾 bridge on my way back to the North city after attending cram school in the south City, I was the happiest moment of the day. When I opened the window, a cool breeze with a little water vapor blew in, and my parents and I shared the school fun of the day, trivial and ordinary happiness. In my opinion, harmony is the key word of China's modernization road. A bridge, a city and a country bring real, down-to-earth and ordinary happiness to the people. 漪汾 bridge is a seven-hole cable-stayed cable bridge. Changhong horizontal wave is seen from a distance and interlinked from a short walk. The setting of this shape is ininicably linked with Taiyuan culture. The rainbow shaped arch on the bridge symbolizes the hospitable character of Taiyuan people, the narrow bridge floor and the walking path symbolize the happy life of Taiyuan people, and the symmetrical bridge floor shows the characteristics of Taiyuan people's pursuit of balance. The setting of the bridge absorbs the personality characteristics of Taiyuan people and integrates the cultural background of Taiyuan city. Just like China's modernization road, it relies on the actual national conditions and truly serves the people. The story of a bridge hides behind the development of Shanxi from the mid-20th century to the 21st century, showing the true spiritual core of China's modernization road.

banking world. 80 00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.400 Now, and then we can then take the input and go into asset allocation, 81 00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.520 portfolio construction with them, monitor and rebalance. 82 00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.700 And by the way, before we go to portfolio construction and 83 00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.860 implementation, there’s no need to talk about anything about products. 84 00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.660 It is what it is. 85 00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.640 Whether or not we get a mandate or not, whether or not it’s GA asset 86 00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.600 does not matter. 87 00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.260 Whether or not it’s a prism versus CMS does not matter. 88 00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.820 It matters from a client’s perspective. 89 00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.980 How do you help them implement that investment objective investment 90 00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.300 goals? 91 00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.460 And we should be product agnostic for the whole conversation. 92 00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.800 And whether or not they implement it when we are the other, it is 93 00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.600 HSBC’s business. 94 00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.280 It’s our business afterwards. 95 00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.360 And we take the client’s input, we take the discussion outcome, and 96 00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.540 try to deliver and implement and fulfill the needs through our platform. 97 00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.880 And that is what it’s really meant when you talk about a strategic 98 00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.360 product

the whole family of three to four, or even 109 00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.140 two generations of families if they have a trust and that is for a 110 00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.000 distribution to families. 111 00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.080 What about the business? 112 00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.480 Do they want to continue to expand their business and make themselves 113 00:06:49.480 -->

Elle examine comment les facteurs socio-économiques influencent et sont influencés par les systèmes d'éducation et d'enseignement. Cette discipline analyse les inégalités sociales dans l'éducation, en se concentrant sur les différences de performances académiques et d'accès à l'éducation entre différents groupes socio-économiques. Elle cherche également à comprendre comment les inégalités économiques peuvent influencer les opportunités éducatives et les résultats des individus. La socio-économie de l'éducation se penche également sur les déterminants économiques de l'éducation, tels que le financement des établissements scolaires, les politiques gouvernementales en matière d'éducation, les investissements publics et privés dans le secteur éducatif, ainsi que les choix économiques des individus et des familles en matière d'éducation. Cette discipline cherche à répondre à des questions telles que : pourquoi certaines populations ont-elles un accès plus limité à l'éducation ? Pourquoi existe-t-il des écarts de performances académiques entre les élèves de différentes classes socio-économiques ? Comment les inégalités socio-économiques se perpétuent-elles dans le système éducatif ? Comment les politiques économiques peuvent-elles favoriser l'équité éducative ? La socio-économie de l'éducation joue un rôle important dans la formulation de politiques éducatives visant à réduire les inégalités socio-économiques dans l'éducation et à promouvoir l'équité éducative. Elle met en lumière les obstacles et les défis auxquels sont confrontés les individus issus de milieux socio-économiques défavorisés et propose des solutions pour améliorer leurs chances d'accéder à une éducation de qualité. Ces recherches contribuent également à une meilleure compréhension de l'impact de l'éducation sur l'économie et la société en général. Des études ont montré que l'accès à une éducation de qualité est un déterminant clé de la mobilité sociale, de la réduction de la pauvreté et de l'amélioration du développement économique. En résumé, la socio-économie de l'éducation étudie les relations complexes entre l'économie et l'éducation, en analysant les inégalités socio-économiques dans l'éducation et en examinant les déterminants économiques de l'éducation.

The soil, disrupted and stripped of its natural components during the extraction process, requires extensive conditioning to restore its fertility and ensure sustainable use. Soil conditioning post gravel extraction operations includes various processes to reintroduce essential nutrients, organic matter, and promote beneficial microorganisms, ultimately reviving the soil's productivity. This essay will discuss the importance of soil conditioning after gravel extraction and highlight the key techniques involved. Importance of Soil Conditioning: After gravel extraction, the resulting soil could be devoid of organic matter and essential nutrients. Soil conditioning is crucial to bring back the vitality of the soil and establish a conducive environment for plants to grow. The conditioned soil not only supports the growth of new vegetation but also promotes the restoration of local ecosystems. Additionally, the reconditioned soil can aid in controlling erosion, reducing sediment runoff into water bodies, and mitigating the overall environmental impact. Key Techniques for Soil Conditioning: 1. Restoring Organic Matter: The first step in soil conditioning after gravel extraction is reintroducing organic matter. Addition of compost, manure, or green cover crops helps replenish the soil's organic content, improving its structure and moisture-holding capacity. Organic matter acts as a nutrient reservoir, aids in water infiltration, enhances microbial activity, and supports plant growth. 2. Nutrient Amendments: Gravel extraction can strip the soil of vital nutrients. Hence, adding essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is critical. Fertilizer application should be based on soil testing to ensure the right balance of nutrients for optimal plant growth. Organic fertilizers, such as fish emulsion or bone meal, can also be used to avoid chemical overload and promote long-term soil health. 3. Soil Aeration: During the extraction process, heavy machinery compresses the soil, resulting in compaction. This compressed soil restricts water movement and air circulation, negatively affecting root development and overall plant growth. Soil aeration techniques, including tilling, plowing, or using mechanical aerators, break up compacted layers, allowing roots to penetrate better and facilitating nutrient uptake. 4. Reintroducing Beneficial Microorganisms: The extraction process can disrupt the natural microbial community in the soil. Reintroducing beneficial microorganisms, such as mycorrhizal fungi, which establish a symbiotic relationship with plant roots, is crucial for nutrient absorption and overall plant health. Other beneficial bacteria can also be added through inoculants or compost, enhancing the soil's biological activity. 5. Erosion Control and Stabilization: Gravel extraction sites are prone to erosion due to the removal of vegetative cover and the alteration of natural gradients. Implementing erosion control measures, such as using erosion control blankets, retaining walls, or terracing, helps stabilize the soil and prevent excessive runoff. Planting grasses or other appropriate vegetation in the affected areas can further strengthen stabilization efforts. Conclusion: Soil conditioning after gravel extraction operations is vital for restoring fertility, promoting plant growth, and reestablishing ecosystems. The addition of organic matter, nutrients, and beneficial microorganisms helps recreate a healthy soil environment. Soil aeration and erosion control techniques further facilitate the revitalization process. By practicing effective soil conditioning techniques, we can ensure the sustainable use of land, minimize environmental impacts, and restore the balance disrupted by gravel extraction operations."},{"prompt":"合计回复·","completion":"对不起，我不理解您的问题。请提供更多细节，以便我可以给予合适的回复。"},{"prompt":"3 adjectives to describe a person who is philosophical, romantic, open-minded, humorous, kind, outgoing, well-rounded","completion":"thoughtful, charismatic, versatile"},{"prompt":"function [ result ] = J3(i,j) global node global n a=0; if node(2,i)==1 %1为PQ节点 if i==j for k=1:n a=a+G(i,k)*f(k)+B(i,k)*e(k); end result=a+B(i,i)*e(i)-G(i,i)*f(i); end if i~=j result=-G(i,j)*f(i)+B(i,j)*e(i); end end if node(2,i)==2 %2为PU节点 if i==j result=-2*e(i); end if i~=j result=0; end end end 解释以上代码","completion":"以上代码定义了一个函数J3，该函数根据输入的i和j返回一个结果。函数内部使用了两个全局变量，node和n。 1. 判断节点i的类型，如果是PQ节点（node(2,i)==1），则执行以下操作： a. 如果i等于j，遍历所有节点k，计算a的值为a+G(i,k)*f(k)+B(i,k)*e(k)。 b. 计算结果为a+B(i,i)*e(i)-G(i,i)*f(i)。 2. 如果节点i的类型是PU节点（node(2,i)==2），则执行以下操作： a. 如果i等于j，结果为-2*e(i)。 b. 如果i不等于j，结果为0。 最后，将计算得到的结果返回。"},{"prompt":"Please refine the following message We are working with other EY component team for the cycle count arrangement in FY2023.

Grice claims that in general the speakers are required to be attentive to these maxims so that their discourse is logical and understandable. He stresses that the meticulous observance of the maxim of quality is a fundamental pre￾condition of sorts, the fulfillment of which will ensure the operation of the other maxims. Nevertheless, there may be situations in which one of the maxims is not honored, in which case the logical or understandable nature of the discourse is compromised. The non-fulfillment of one of the maxims of the Cooperative Principle can occur in the following ways: (1) the speaker violates one of the maxims in such a way that his listeners do not notice the violation (for example, he may contribute irrelevant information to the discussion), and he thus misleads them; (2) the speaker refuses to cooperate with his listeners (for example, he refuses to answer a question); (3) the speaker causes two maxims to clash—for example, he may violate the maxim of quality by means of over-strict observance of the maxim of quantity (he provides information that is exact but falls short of clarifying what happened); and (4) the speaker is contemptuous of the maxims and does not observe them at all. In such a case the addressee, who believes that both he and his interlocutor are being faithful to the Cooperative Principle, is deceived. In the opinion of Mey (1993), a person might ignore the Cooperative Principle if by thus ignoring it he attains results that benefit him. Mey illustrates this in the world of literature. He says that good writers use techniques of concealment (deliberate omission, misleading statements, uninformative or disinformative remarks) which contradict the Cooperative Principle. In effect, they are deception experts. Sperber and Wilson (1986) believe that pragmatics requires one rule only: Relevance Theory, according to which ‘‘The successful communicator is one who makes his or her intention to convey information, to persuade, to make believe, etc. manifest to the partner.’’ The agreement between speaker and listener that the speaker has something to convey to the listener is a good enough reason for the latter to believe the former. We believe that the author of a lie is able to rely on this belief and tell the listener things that are not true, thereby violating the maxim of Relevance. Galasinski (2000) claims that deceptive communication feeds off communication that is not deceptive. In order to put a lie across, the addresser must conceal it within a discourse of truth and in non-deceptive contexts. From a pragmatic standpoint, the liar intermingles open and hidden messages. The addressee does not detect the hidden messages and believes all that he is told as a single unit. In this way the act of the lie is carried out—the deceptive messages are likely to be either expressed explicitly or else understood although not uttered outright. Our attempts at using linguistic cues to detect attempts to mislead are based on the assumption that there is a difference between the language of an individual when he is not telling the truth and his ‘‘normal,’’ truthful language. Fraser (1991) says that this difference is the result of a feeling of stress, which is manifest in a decline in capacity for cognitive integration, in precision, in organization, and in ranking things. These difficulties result in a change in the normal elements of the speaker’s language. The fabrication is part of a large system of misrepresentation, within the framework of interpersonal communication (Fraser, 1994), and it is done consciously. Fraser (ibid.) says that every representation by the speaker includes a message. This message contains the content (the reality) and the speaker’s attitude toward it. A misrepresentation is the transfer of erroneous information (incorrect content) or a false attitude toward the information that is presented. A misleading attitude will be seen in inappropriate communication, such as an insincere apology, an empty promise, or a self-serving request. A combination of a misrepresentation of content and attitude is most common. A speaker has an array of possible ways to present fraudulent information. He can take the direct, explicit approach (the lie) or a roundabout one, in which his message can be inferred by the listener but is not stated outright. Sornig (1989) adds that the change in an auditor’s perceptions is accomplished through the way in which the things are said, without taking into consideration the degree of truth of the information. Until the 1980s, most of the research on the lie and deception focused on non-verbal cues. Very few studies dealt with verbal cues. The 1980s saw the beginning of work on para-linguistic cues: pauses, duration of response, and errors in speech (in this paper, these cues are referred to as ‘‘the prosody of speech’’) (Shuy, 1998), as well as a linguistic examination to identify a deception (Dulaney, 1982). The research of the last two or three decades included examinations of morphology, syntax, and semantics and, in recent years, also of discourse. The findings of the researchers were various: response time was shorter, there were fewer special words, a smaller number of verbs in the past tense, and a faster speech rhythm when an individual was lying (Dulaney, 1982); there were fewer words in the discourse, as well as a tendency to short messages, there were fewer factual declarations and more general ones, linguistic ambiguity and repeated double declarations, fewer group markers (we, our, all of us) with more markers of diminishment (few, a little, hardly), more markers of the other (they), fewer personal declarations and the speaker referred to himself less (Knapp et al., 1974).","completion":"Grice认为，通常说话人需要注意这些准则，以确保他们的对话是合乎逻辑和可理解的。他强调严谨地遵守真实性准则是一种基本前提，其履行将确保其他准则的运行。然而，在某些情况下，可能有一个准则未被尊重，这种情况下，对话的逻辑性或可理解性就受到了损害。在合作原则的准则不履行的情况下，可以以以下方式发生：(1)说话人违反一个准则，以致他的听者没有注意到这样的违反(例如，他可能向讨论中提供无关信息)，从而误导他们；(2)说话人拒绝与听者合作(例如，他拒绝回答问题)；(3)说话人造成两个准则冲突，例如他可能通过过度严格地遵循数量准则来违反质量准则(他提供的信息准确但未完全澄清发生的事情)；(4)说话人对准则不屑一顾，完全不遵守。在这种情况下，认为自己和对话者都忠实于合作原则的听话者会被欺骗。根据Mey(1993)的观点，如果一个人通过忽视合作原则获得有益结果，他可能会忽视合作原则。Mey在文学界以例子说明了这一点。他说好的作家使用掩盖的技巧(故意省略、误导性陈述、不提供信息或误导信息)，这些技巧与合作原则相矛盾。实际上，他们是欺骗专家。Sperber和Wilson(1986)认为，语用学只需要一个规则：关联理论，认为“成功的交际者是那些能够让他们传达信息、说服、使人相信等意图显露给对话者的人。” 说话人和听话者之间达成的一致认为说话人有某种东西要传达给听话者已经足够让后者相信前者的理由。我们认为一个谎言的作者可以依赖这种信念并告诉听众一些不真实的事情，从而违反了关联的准则。 Galasinski(2000)认为，欺骗性的交流是以非欺骗性的交流为基础的。为了成功地撒谎，发话人必须将其隐藏在真实而非欺骗性的话语和环境中。从语用学的观点来看，撒谎者混合了公开和隐藏的信息。听话者无法察觉到隐藏的信息，并相信他所听到的全部。通过这种方式，谎言行为得以实施，欺骗性的信息往往无论是明确表达还是默默理解，都会被传达。 我们试图通过使用语言线索来检测误导企图，基于的假设是当一个人不说真话时，他的语言与他“正常”、真实的语言之间存在差异。Fraser(1991)说，这种差异是一种压力感的结果，在认知整合、准确性、组织和排序方面表现出来。这些困难导致说话人语言中正常元素的改变。欺骗行为是在人际交流框架内的广泛误导系统中的一部分，并且是有意为之的。Fraser(同上)说，说话人的每个陈述都包含一条信息。这条信息包含内容(现实)和说话人对其的态度。误导是传递错误信息(不正确的内容)或对所呈现信息的错误态度。这种误导态度将在不适当的交流中显现，比如虚伪的道歉、空洞的承诺或以自身为中心的要求。内容和态度的误导组合最为常见。说话人有各种可能的方式来呈现虚假信息。他既可以采取直接、明确的方式(谎言)，也可以采取迂回的方式，通过听话者可以推断但没有明确陈述的信息来进行传达。Sornig(1989)补充说，通过说话方式完成对听众感知的改变，而不考虑信息的真实程度。 在20世纪80年代之前，对于谎言和欺骗的研究主要集中在非语言线索上。很少有研究涉及语言线索。20世纪80年代开始进行了对于准语音线索的研究：停顿、回答时间的长短和发言错误(本文将这些线索称为“语音节奏”)，以及语言考察以确定一种欺骗(Dulaney, 1982)。过去二三十年的研究包括了对形态、句法和语义的考察，近年来还包括对话语的考察。研究者的发现各有不同：当一个人撒谎时，他的回应时间更短，特殊词汇更少，过去时态的动词更少，语速更快(Dulaney, 1982)；在话语中词语更少，有倾向于简短的信息，陈述事实的陈述更少而更多是一般性的，语言的歧义和重复的双重陈述，小团体标记词(我们、我们的、我们所有人)更少，而少数减小标记词(少、一点、几乎没有)，其他人的标记词(他们)更多，个人陈述更少，说话人对自己的提及更少(Knapp等人，1974)。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

His eyes are fixed on the computer monitor in front of him, which displays the live surveillance footage of the prison inmates. The room is filled with the glow of the computer screen, casting eerie shadows on the walls. The guard's chair creaks as he leans forward, engrossed in the images flashing on the monitor. There is a sense of tension and urgency in the air as he scrutinizes each frame, searching for any sign of trouble. Through the window, a storm rages outside, with raindrops drumming against the glass. The guard's worn-out uniform and the outdated equipment scattered on his desk hint at a place stuck in time. The composition centers on the guard, his face partially obscured by the reflection on the monitor, adding to the overall mystery and suspense. The atmosphere is one of constant vigilance and apprehension, as the guard fulfills his duty in this isolated and somber setting. A realistic photographic style with a 35mm lens and medium depth of field captures the essence of the moment, blending elements of documentary and film noir photography. --ar 16:9 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: Inside a cramped and dingy surveillance room, the guard stands before a bank of monitors. The flickering screens display grainy black and white surveillance footage of the prison inmates in their cells. The images are distorted and filled with static, making it difficult to discern the activities of the inmates. The room is cluttered with old-fashioned equipment, tangled wires, and stacks of paperwork. Harsh fluorescent lights hang from the ceiling, casting an unflattering glare on the guard's tired face. Outside the room, the noise of the prison echoes in the distance, creating an unsettling atmosphere. The composition captures the guard from a low angle, emphasizing his weariness and the weight of his responsibilities. The overall mood is one of confinement, tension, and a sense of surveillance. To realize this scene, a gritty and raw style of photography is employed, using a wide-angle lens and high contrast, reminiscent of street photography by Daido Moriyama. --ar 9:16 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: Standing in an expansive control room, the guard gazes at a panoramic video wall composed of multiple high-definition screens. The screens display vibrant and crystal-clear surveillance footage of the prison, capturing the inmates in vivid detail. The room is filled with state-of-the-art technology, sleek touchscreens, and modern ergonomic furniture. Soft ambient lighting bathes the room, creating a comfortable working environment. Outside the control room, large windows reveal a breathtaking view of the prison grounds, with lush greenery and blue skies stretching as far as the eye can see. The composition highlights the guard in the foreground, surrounded by the array of monitors, emphasizing the fusion of technology and human observation. The atmosphere is one of efficiency and control, as the guard oversees the prison operations from this technologically advanced and serene setting. To bring this scene to life, a polished and realistic photographic style is employed, using a 70mm lens to capture fine details and a deep depth of field, reminiscent of architectural photography. --ar 16:9 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: In a small makeshift office, the guard sits on a worn-out chair, his back hunched over the desk. The room is filled with stacks of papers, old surveillance equipment, and flickering fluorescent lights. The computer in front of him displays blurry and distorted surveillance footage, making it difficult to discern any details. Dust particles float in the stagnant air, illuminated by the dim light. The guard's tired eyes scan the footage, searching for any irregularities among the chaotic and indistinct images. The composition centers on the guard, capturing his isolation and weariness as he struggles to maintain order amidst the chaos. The atmosphere is one of desolation and disarray, as if time has forgotten this forgotten corner of the prison. To enhance the realism of this scene, a documentary-style approach is employed, with a focus on capturing the raw emotions and candid moments. The use of a 50mm lens and shallow depth of field adds a sense of intimacy and vulnerability to the image, reminiscent of photojournalism. --ar 1:1 --v 5.2"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},I={class:"card-container"},z={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],W={key:0},M={key:1};function L(n,e,h,m,o,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",I,[(a(!0),i(x,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",z,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
