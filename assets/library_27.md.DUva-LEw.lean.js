Given the fact \\"the Himalayas were formed by rock folding\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"Rocks folded over and over which developed\\"","completion":"Rocks folded over and over, which developed the massive and complex mountain range known as the Himalayas. The formation of this extraordinary geological structure is a result of the continuous tectonic activity in the region, primarily involving the convergent movement of the Indian and Eurasian plates. This long and intricate process has not only impacted the landscape but has also influenced the climate, ecology, and human societies in the surrounding areas. The Himalayas developed from a series of geological events that took place over millions of years. The Indian Plate, which was once part of the ancient supercontinent Gondwana, began to break away around 140-150 million years ago. This plate gradually drifted toward the north and eventually collided with the Eurasian Plate approximately 50 million years ago. The immense pressure exerted by this collision caused the rocks at the boundary of these two plates to buckle and fold, leading to the rise of the Himalayan mountain range. Rocks folding over and over resulted from the continuous subduction and uplifting of the Indian Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate. The Himalayas primarily consist of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, which were originally layers of sediment deposited in the ancient Tethys Sea. As the Indian Plate pushed into the Eurasian Plate, these layers of sediment were compressed, deformed, and metamorphosed under high pressure and temperatures. This process ultimately caused the longitudinal and transverse folding of rocks, creating the intricate peaks and valleys that can be observed in the Himalayas today. Over millions of years, the ongoing movement of tectonic plates has continued to raise the Himalayas, making them the highest mountain range in the world. This unique topography has had a profound impact on regional climate patterns, as the high peaks act as a barrier preventing the penetration of the monsoon winds into Central Asia. The abrupt rise of the mountains also results in dramatic changes in vegetation and wildlife over a short geographical distance. The Himalayas contain a rich biodiversity, with several endemic species of flora and fauna adapted to the specific altitudes and environmental conditions. Mountain ecosystems include tropical forests, temperate forests, alpine meadows, and arctic tundras that support a wide array of plants, birds, and mammals, many of which are endangered or threatened, such as red pandas and snow leopards. Furthermore, the formation of the Himalayas has had significant implications on human societies for thousands of years. The mountain range boasts a rich cultural history, with the region being home to various ethnic groups and holding spiritual significance in Hinduism, Buddhism, and other religions. The rivers that originate in the Himalayas, such as the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus, provide water resources for more than a billion people across South Asia, shaping the development and sustenance of their civilization. In conclusion, the folding of rocks over and over developed the magnificent Himalayas, affecting not only the physical landscape but also the climate, ecology, and human societies surrounding it. This ongoing geological process has produced a unique and dynamic environment that continues to influence the lives of those who reside within its reach, as well as those who are captivated by its astounding natural beauty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It may vary from one person to another and cannot be considered a reliable or universal source of erasers. - Schools: Some schools may have erasers readily available at various locations, such as in classrooms or at an on-campus store. If you are a student or staff member, you might be able to find an eraser in school. However, not everyone has access to a school, so this option would not be universally appropriate. - Pencil box: Similar to the desk drawer, a pencil box may contain an eraser if someone has previously placed it there. This source is limited to personal belongings and is not guaranteed to bear erasers for everyone. - Principal: Though an unconventional option, it is possible that a school principal might have an eraser available in their office. However, they are unlikely to be the primary source for erasers, and it seems impractical to approach the principal of a school every time someone needs an eraser. In contrast, an office supply store is the most reliable and accessible option for obtaining an eraser. It is a standard location for people to purchase various stationery items, and one can expect to find erasers in a wide range of types, sizes, and brands. This option is also convenient as office supply stores are commonplace and can be found in both urban and rural areas, shopping malls, and online platforms. Furthermore, office supply stores cater to the needs of individuals, schools, and businesses, ensuring that a significant portion of the population would have access to erasers when needed.

Numerous evidence support this claim, including historical treaties, the principle of uti possidetis juris, Argentina's post-independence actions, legal precedents, and the international recognition of its sovereignty. Below is a detailed analysis of the supporting evidence: 1. Spanish Colonial Legacy: As a former Spanish colony, Argentina became part of the Spanish Empire, which extended across South America. Spain's territorial acquisitions and its exercise of sovereignty over these lands were based on the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), the papal bull Inter caetera (1493), and the Treaty of Madrid (1750), among others. These treaties divided the New World between Spain and Portugal and established Spanish sovereignty over most of present-day Argentina. 2. Uti Possidetis Juris Principle: This principle of international law, which originates from Roman law, dictates that newly independent states should retain the borders they had held as colonies. Following the Argentine War of Independence (1810-1818), Argentina became a sovereign and independent state, inheriting Spain's territorial claims in the region. This principle further cemented Argentina's legitimacy as the rightful successor of Spain's claim to sovereignty. 3. Post-Independence Actions: Argentina's actions after achieving independence in 1816 further reinforced its status as the inheritor of Spain's claims. The Argentine government asserted control and authority over the territories that had been part of the Spanish Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, including present-day Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and parts of Bolivia. Additionally, Argentina carried out administrative, political, and military functions in these territories, which further strengthened its sovereignty claims. 4. Legal Precedents: Throughout history, various international legal precedents have reinforced the notion that Argentina inherited Spain's sovereignty claims. For instance, in the Island of Palmas Case (1928) and the Eastern Greenland Case (1933), the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) recognized the principle of effective occupation and control as a key factor in determining sovereignty, which was predominantly based on Argentina's Spanish colonial legacy and its subsequent actions as an independent state. 5. International Recognition: Argentina's claim to sovereignty was also fortified by the international recognition of its status as a sovereign state and its inherited territorial rights. Numerous countries formally recognized Argentina as an independent state and established diplomatic relations as such, supporting its territorial claims. This recognition further strengthened Argentina's claim to having inherited Spain's territorial sovereignty. In conclusion, evidence such as historical treaties, the principle of uti possidetis juris, Argentina's post-independence actions, legal precedents, and international recognition of its sovereignty, lend substantial support to the claim that Argentina inherited Spain's claim to sovereignty. This inheritance allowed Argentina to establish its territorial boundaries and exercise legitimate authority over its lands as the successor of the Spanish Empire in the region."},{"prompt":"Given those answer options, answer the question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: What is the name of the six-part comic book mini-series based on a character in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2?

I would have preferred to view the story line in chronological order.

Please answer the following question: Process: - You eat food - Your stomach digests the food - Sugars from food enter your bloodstream - Insulin helps turn sugars into energy - Insulin helps your body store the energy in fat, muscle and liver cells - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the climate has changed happens, how will it affect food is digested inside stomach. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The process of food digestion inside the stomach is typically independent of external climate changes. However, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that if a climate change occurs, it might have indirect effects on the process. Indirect effects of climate change on food digestion inside the stomach could include: 1. Changes in the availability and nutritional content of food: Climate change may result in alterations in agricultural practices and food production, which could lead to changes in the types and quality of food that people consume. These changes may affect digestion in various ways, such as by altering the balance of macronutrients and micronutrients in the diet. 2. Changes in microbiome composition: The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in digestion and overall gastrointestinal health. Climate change could lead to changes in the environment that affect the composition and diversity of gut bacteria, altering the efficiency of digestion. 3. Increased stress and anxiety: Climate change can lead to increased stress and anxiety, which can affect the digestive system by causing gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome and indigestion. 4. Impact on metabolism: While not directly related to the process of digestion in the stomach, climate change could influence an individual's metabolism by altering environmental temperatures. For example, sustained exposure to colder temperatures may increase energy expenditure, while warmer temperatures might lead to changes in appetite and digestion efficiency. While the perturbation hypothesis suggests that climate change might have indirect effects on the food digestion process, it is essential to recognize that these effects are influenced by various factors, such as diet, environmental conditions, and overall health. Therefore, it is difficult to generalize the impact of climate change on food digestion for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: The wife of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has not been seen in public for seven months prompting speculation that she is either pregnant or has fallen out of favour. Experts monitoring the situation in Pyongyang have suggested Ri Sol-ju, who was introduced as First Lady in 2012, may have fallen out with Kim Jong-un’s younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, who is increasingly regarded as the power behind the throne. Kim Yo-jong was put in charge of North Korea’s Propaganda and Agitation Department last year and is responsible for building up her brother’s cult of personality. Ri was last seen on a tour of a new commercial district and health complex in Pyongyang on 28 March, South Korean news agency Yonhap News reported. In contrast Kim Jong-un has frequently been seen touring the country and hosted the country’s first party congress in 36 years in May. Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo’s Waseda University who focuses on the Pyongyang leadership, told The Telegraph Ri’s disappearance could be down to several factors. He said: \\"There are several possible reasons, including that she is pregnant or that there is some sort of problem between the two of them. \\"There have also been reports of instability in Pyongyang and even of several attempted attacks, including by factions in the North Korean military, against Kim last year. \\"It is possible that Ri has not appeared in public because she is being closely guarded.\\" Life in North Korea captured with a mobile phone 30 show all Life in North Korea captured with a mobile phone 1/30 Farmer works in a field Getty Images 2/30 Women soldier walk on the street Getty Images 3/30 A female soldier guards railway Getty Images 4/30 A general view of platform of Pyongyang Railway Station Getty Images 5/30 Students stage a protest against South Korea and the US in Pyongyang Getty Images 6/30 Students rehearsal for celebrating the 70th birthday of Workers' Party of Korea Getty Images 7/30 People enjoy the cool at the carriage door Getty Images 8/30 A general view of countryside Getty Images 9/30 Korean People's Army soldier rest on the rail 2015 Getty Images 10/30 A little boy begs food on the platform in Hamhung Railway Station in Hamhung 2015 Getty Images 11/30 Children swim in a river in noon Getty Images 12/30 People cross a railway crossing 2015 Getty Images 13/30 A boy collects corn cob beside a railway Getty Images 14/30 A customs officer is seen on the train No.100 from Moscow to Pyongyang at Tumangang railway station in Tumangang Getty Images 15/30 A customs officer checks a passenger's mobile device on the train to Pyongyang Getty Images 16/30 A railway station in Tumangang Getty Images 17/30 A general view of the railway station in Tumangang Getty Images 18/30 Kids pass by Tumanggang railway station in Tumanggang 2015 Getty Images 19/30 A general view of Tumangang Getty Images 20/30 A general view of Tumangang - a small town located at North Korea and Russia border Getty Images 21/30 A train carriage on it's way to Pyongyang is delayed for a day and half due to military transportation in Tumangang Getty Images 22/30 A customs officers talks to a passenger at Tumanggang railway station in Tumanggang Getty Images 23/30 A little girl walks on the street in Tumanggang 2015 Getty Images 24/30 An elderly man is seen in Tumangang Getty Images 25/30 Kids go to school in morning in Tumangang 2015 Getty Images 26/30 27/30 28/30 29/30 30/30 1/30 Farmer works in a field Getty Images 2/30 Women soldier walk on the street Getty Images 3/30 A female soldier guards railway Getty Images 4/30 A general view of platform of Pyongyang Railway Station Getty Images 5/30 Students stage a protest against South Korea and the US in Pyongyang Getty Images 6/30 Students rehearsal for celebrating the 70th birthday of Workers' Party of Korea Getty Images 7/30 People enjoy the cool at the carriage door Getty Images 8/30 A general view of countryside Getty Images 9/30 Korean People's Army soldier rest on the rail 2015 Getty Images 10/30 A little boy begs food on the platform in Hamhung Railway Station in Hamhung 2015 Getty Images 11/30 Children swim in a river in noon Getty Images 12/30 People cross a railway crossing 2015 Getty Images 13/30 A boy collects corn cob beside a railway Getty Images 14/30 A customs officer is seen on the train No.100 from Moscow to Pyongyang at Tumangang railway station in Tumangang Getty Images 15/30 A customs officer checks a passenger's mobile device on the train to Pyongyang Getty Images 16/30 A railway station in Tumangang Getty Images 17/30 A general view of the railway station in Tumangang Getty Images 18/30 Kids pass by Tumanggang railway station in Tumanggang 2015 Getty Images 19/30 A general view of Tumangang Getty Images 20/30 A general view of Tumangang - a small town located at North Korea and Russia border Getty Images 21/30 A train carriage on it's way to Pyongyang is delayed for a day and half due to military transportation in Tumangang Getty Images 22/30 A customs officers talks to a passenger at Tumanggang railway station in Tumanggang Getty Images 23/30 A little girl walks on the street in Tumanggang 2015 Getty Images 24/30 An elderly man is seen in Tumangang Getty Images 25/30 Kids go to school in morning in Tumangang 2015 Getty Images 26/30 27/30 28/30 29/30 30/30 He said Kim Yo-jong held a great deal of influence over her brother as it is believed “that while Mr Kim lacks political ability, she is far more adept at the sort of manoeuvring that is required to keep him in power, so that is the task she has taken on”. Ri last disappeared from public view in 2012 prompting speculation that she had fallen out of favour or was pregnant. In 2013, former US basketball star Dennis Rodman - who has become an unlikely friend to the regime - revealed she had given birth to a daughter in late 2012. But Kim Jong-un is not above disposing of those closest to him if they fall out of favour. He executed his uncle, Jang Sung-taek, after finding him guilty of treason despite their relationship being reportedly close beforehand. Announcing the execution, Kim Jong-un denounced him as “human scum worse than a dog” for an alleged attempt to overthrow him and introduce reform. ||||| SEOUL, Oct. 31 (UPI) -- North Korea's first lady has not been seen in public for seven months. According to information from South Korea's unification ministry, Ri Sol Ju has not been in the public eye since late March, when she visited a newly opened department store in Pyongyang with Kim Jong Un, News 1 reported. Seoul says North Korea reported 100 instances of Kim appearances in 2016, but Ri only appeared by his side only three times, according to the report. On Feb. 15, Ri attended an award ceremony and dinner for North Korean scientists after the launch of the Kwangmyongsong-4 earth observation satellite on Feb. 7, visited the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun on Feb. 17, and was last seen at an upscale department store in Pyongyang on March 28. During the last visit, Kim wore a stylish blue skirt suit while touring the store filled with North Korea-made \\"cosmetics, household electronics and food items,\\" according to state media. Ri typically accompanies Kim on civilian site visits, staying out of public view when the North Korean leader provides field guidance to military personnel or oversees rocket launches. But Ri was not mentioned in Kim's recent visits to a newly built soap factory, a recently opened eye hospital and a souvenir factory. There are rumors Ri is pregnant with a second child or is encountering \\"disharmony,\\" possibly with members of Kim's family, according to News 1. Ri has been more active in the past. In 2012, she was seen in public 18 times, 22 times in 2013, 15 times in 2014 and seven times in 2015. North Koreans in the country have said Ri is not well liked because of her lavish lifestyle. ||||| The wife of Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, has not been seen in public for more than seven months, prompting speculation of instability in Pyongyang, pregnancy or a falling out with her husband. An alternative suggestion put forward by experts monitoring the regime in North Korea is that Ri Sol-ju may have crossed Kim Yo-jong, the leader's younger sister, who is increasingly emerging as the power behind her brother's throne. ||||| For seven months, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s wife hasn't been seen at any public events. The disappearance of Ri Sol-ju has left experts who monitor Kim and the North Korean government scratching their heads to try and come up with a plausible explanation as to where she is. Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo’s Waseda University who studies Pyongyang leadership, told the Telegraph in a report published Monday that there could be several explanations for Ri’s disappearance, including family infighting and pregnancy. “There are several possible reasons, including that she is pregnant or that there is some sort of problem between the two of them,” Shigemura said. “There have also been reports of instability in Pyongyang and even of several attempted attacks, including by factions in the North Korean military, against Kim last year.” “It is possible that Ri has not appeared in public because she is being closely guarded,” he continued. Ri hasn’t been seen publicly since March 28, when she was spotted on a tour of a new commercial district and health complex in Pyongyang, the Independent reported. During that same time, Kim has frequently ventured out for public events. The two have been married since 2012 and have at least one child together. Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jon, was reportedly put in charge of North Korea’s propaganda and agitation efforts last year and has since then been working to build up the image of her brother in the media. Many believe that the female Kim may be the real sibling running the country from behind the scenes. If there are marital issues between Kim and his wife it wouldn’t be the first time that he’s disposed of a close loved one when necessary. The Kim administration has been known for its purges of political opponents, including an execution in 2013 of Kim’s uncle Jang Song Thaek. |||||","completion":"The wife of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Ri Sol-ju, has not been seen in public for seven months, which has prompted people to wonder if she might be pregnant or if something else has happened to her. Some experts think she might be having problems with Kim Jong-un's younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, who seems to have a lot of power and is helping her brother stay in control. Another idea is that Ri Sol-ju is being kept safe because there have been reports of people trying to attack Kim Jong-un.

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

Reflect on past experiences. Give it time to see if the feelings stick around. Talk with a counselor to further explore your sexuality.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Unraveling the Intricacies of Romantic Feelings: A Comprehensive Guide to Self-reflection, Time, and Counseling Introduction Love and relationships can often be complicated, leaving many people lost in a sea of emotions, questioning the nature of their feelings toward someone. Is it friendship, admiration, or could it be romantic love? As we journey through life, we encounter various people with whom we share unique connections– and understanding whether these feelings are romantic can be a baffling experience. In this article, we'll explore the different signs and strategies to determine if your feelings for someone are indeed romantic, and how journaling, reflecting on your past experiences, giving it time, and talking with a counselor can help shed light on your emotions and sexuality. 1. Know How to Tell if Your Feelings Are Romantic The first step in understanding your feelings toward someone is to identify the signs of romantic attraction. Common indicators include: - Butterflies in your stomach whenever you think about or see the person - The desire to spend more time with them and learn about their interests - Prioritizing their happiness and well-being - Feeling a sense of protectiveness toward them - Experiencing jealousy when they're interested in someone else - Feeling inspired to improve yourself in their presence These feelings do not guarantee romantic love, but they act as a strong starting point in helping you navigate your emotions. 2. Journal About How You’re Feeling Sometimes, the easiest way to comprehend your emotions is to write them down and observe them on paper. Journaling allows you to express your feelings openly, without the fear of judgment from others. This method can help you: - Organize your thoughts - Recognize patterns and habits in your feelings - Discover potential triggers for your emotions - Identify any fears or insecurities regarding your feelings As you navigate your emotions on paper, you may begin to understand the nature of your feelings– whether they're romantic or platonic. 3. Reflect on Past Experiences Evaluating your past experiences with love and attraction can provide valuable insight into your current emotions. Consider the following questions as you reflect: - Have you experienced similar feelings in the past, and what was the outcome? - How do your current emotions differ from past relationships or attractions? - Does your history maintain a pattern of falling for people with specific attributes? - Were there consequences in past relationships that you'd like to avoid in the future? By analyzing your past, you can uncover essential clues about your feelings and determine if it's romantic love or another type of connection. 4. Give it Time to See if the Feelings Stick Around Sometimes, discerning the nature of your emotions requires time and patience. As you allow your feelings to evolve, take note of any changes in their intensity and consistency. Crushes and infatuations may fade over time, while genuine romantic feelings tend to grow stronger and more profound. 5. Talk with a Counselor to Further Explore Your Sexuality For some people, understanding their emotions may involve delving into their sexuality. If you're unsure about your feelings or are questioning your sexual orientation, seeking the guidance of a mental health professional or counselor can be beneficial. A counselor can: - Provide a safe and supportive environment for discussing your feelings - Offer guidance and coping strategies to navigate complex emotions - Help identify potential patterns and barriers that limit your self-discovery - Offer resources for additional support and education Conclusion Recognizing and understanding your romantic feelings may be a complex and challenging journey, but employing strategies such as journaling, reflecting on past experiences, giving it time, and speaking with a counselor can help demystify your emotions. In connecting with yourself, you'll ultimately feel more empowered in your relationships, embrace your emotions, and nurture a greater understanding of who you are and what you desire in love and companionship."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that Posner, despite his thorough research and analysis, cannot claim to know for \\"sure\\" who killed MLK. As an author and investigative journalist, Posner presents an account based on available evidence, witness statements, and known facts surrounding the case. His conclusion that James Earl Ray was guilty of the assassination is an opinion supported by the evidence he presents in his book.

Furthermore, it is vital to consider that Posner's book is an interpretation of the evidence he collected and analyzed. Other researchers and authors may present alternative viewpoints based on the same evidence or additional information. Consequently, while Posner's book provides a detailed and compelling case that James Earl Ray was guilty of assassinating Martin Luther King Jr., it does not mean we can infer that the author knows for sure who killed MLK. Instead, we can acknowledge that Posner's work is a significant contribution to the investigation of this historical event, providing a well-researched account that argues against Ray's claims of innocence."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Don’t plant Java fern into substrate.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: The Art and Advantages of Adding Java Ferns to Your Aquarium Introduction: Java Fern (Microsorum pteropus) is a popular aquatic plant species that is known for its hardiness, versatility, and natural beauty. Not only can the Java Fern easily adapt to various water conditions and light requirements, but it can also provide a natural habitat and improve the overall aesthetics of your fish tank. Java Fern's ability to grow both attached to driftwood or left to float freely offers aquarists several options when it comes to incorporating this attractive, low-maintenance plant into their aquariums. In this article, we will explore the different methods for adding Java Ferns to your tank and the various benefits they offer. Step 1: Selecting the Perfect Java Fern for Your Tank When selecting a Java Fern for your aquarium, ensure that the plant is healthy and vibrant. Look for leaves that are deep green and free of any discoloration or damage. Inspect the roots and rhizome, the horizontal part of the plant from which leaves and roots grow, to ensure they are strong and healthy. Healthy roots and rhizomes will ensure the continued growth and vitality of your Java Fern, which is crucial when attaching it to driftwood or letting it float freely. Step 2: Adding Java Fern Attached to Driftwood If you choose to place a Java Fern that's attached to driftwood in your tank, this can be an excellent way to create a natural-looking focal point. The process is relatively simple: 1. Select a suitable piece of aquarium-safe driftwood. 2. Attach the Java Fern to the driftwood using fishing line, thread, or plastic ties. Wrap the thread or ties around the rhizome of the Java Fern, making sure not to damage the roots. 3. Gently place the driftwood with the attached Java Fern into the aquarium, ensuring that the fern's orientation allows for room to grow and receive proper sunlight. Step 3: Letting Unattached Java Ferns Float Freely Floating Java Ferns can add an interesting look to your aquarium, providing shade for the aquarium's inhabitants while also facilitating oxygen exchange. To let your unattached Java Fern float freely: 1. Simply place the Java Fern in your aquarium water near the surface. 2. Monitor the plant's growth and rotation as necessary so that it receives an adequate amount of sunlight. Alternatively, you can secure an unattached rhizome using a thread or plastic ties, anchoring it to objects such as rocks or aquarium decorations, or even try using super glue gel to affix the fern to various surfaces within your tank. Step 4: Avoid Planting Java Ferns in Substrate It's essential to note that Java Ferns should not be planted directly into the substrate of your aquarium, as doing so can lead to the rhizome rotting and the plant ultimately perishing. The natural growth habit of Java Fern is to attach itself to other objects in its habitat, so it's best to mimic that process within your aquarium. Conclusion: Java Ferns are a fantastic addition to any aquarium, boasting not only visual appeal but also numerous benefits for the aquarium's inhabitants and water quality. Utilizing the various methods of adding Java Ferns, such as attaching them to driftwood or letting them float freely, will enhance your aquarium's aesthetics while providing your fish with a more natural and comfortable environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 1: Can you get pregnant the day before your period starts? Question 2: Is it possible to get pregnant before your regular period? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"The answer to these two questions is similar but not exactly the same, as they refer to slightly different scenarios. I will provide a detailed answer for both questions to clarify the differences. Question 1: Can you get pregnant the day before your period starts? In most cases, the likelihood of getting pregnant the day before your period starts is relatively low, but it is not impossible. This is because conception largely depends on the timing of ovulation and the lifespan of the sperm and egg. A typical menstrual cycle lasts about 28 days, with ovulation (the release of an egg) occurring around the 14th day. However, not every woman has a regular menstrual cycle, and the ovulation day may vary from each cycle. Sperm can survive in the female reproductive system for up to five days, while an egg can survive for about 24 hours after being released. The day before a woman's period usually belongs to the luteal phase, which occurs after ovulation. During this phase, the lining of the uterus prepares for a possible pregnancy, and if fertilization does not occur, it sheds, leading to menstruation. Since the egg has a short lifespan and has likely disintegrated by this time, it would be difficult for sperm to fertilize it. However, if a woman has an irregular cycle or experiences early ovulation, the chances of getting pregnant could increase. Question 2: Is it possible to get pregnant before your regular period? Yes, it is possible to get pregnant before your regular period. This is especially true for women with irregular menstrual cycles, which affects around 30% of women. Irregular cycles make it challenging to predict ovulation accurately, making it more difficult to avoid pregnancy or plan conception. For women with regular cycles, though the likelihood of getting pregnant decreases as their period approaches, it is not completely impossible. As mentioned earlier, sperm can survive for up to five days in the female reproductive system, so having sexual intercourse even a few days before the period can still lead to pregnancy if the ovulation occurred earlier than usual. It is essential to note that the fertility window (the days when a woman is more likely to conceive) can differ significantly, even for those who have regular menstrual cycles. Factors such as stress, illness, and lifestyle changes can all impact ovulation, either causing it to occur earlier or later than expected. In conclusion, while the chances of getting pregnant the day before your period or before your regular period tend to be low, it is not impossible. Various factors can influence the timing of ovulation and the chances of conception. If you want to prevent pregnancy or plan for it, tracking your menstrual cycle and using protection, such as condoms or other contraceptives, are recommended.

Movie title: Buddha Mar Gaya Movie plot: Money corrupts and a humongous amount of money corrupts humongously. That's the take off point for Buddha Mar Gaya - a black comedy about dead bodies, mucho moolah and funerals. Laxmikant Kabadiya aka LK (Anupam Kher), is one of India's richest industrialists, a self made man who's risen from selling scrap to become a construction magnate. His conglomerate is on the verge of a 5000 crore IPO that should make them one of the largest companies in the country. LK's family - comprising of his spinster twin sister Prerna, his two sons Ranjeet and Sameer, their wives Shruti and Anju respectively and Ranjeet's daughters Sanjana and Namrata, and Sameer's son, Pawan, can't stop salivating at the thought of all that money. Unfortunately for all of them fate displays a wicked sense of humour. On the night before the IPO opens, LK dies. The family is distraught and horrified. Not because a loved one has died but because now no one will buy their shares. So, on the advice of their family guru - Vidyut Baba (Om Puri), the family decides to hide the death of LK for a period of two days till the shares are all sold out. Little do they realize the crazy series of events that will follow on account of this duplicity. After all, hiding the death of a man as famous as LK, is a Herculean task. To make matters worse, every time they're ready to announce LK's death, fate intervenes forcing them to keep his death hidden for another couple of days. Which results in them having to announce the death of a fictitious friend or relative of LK's... And stage fake funerals. Which of course means generating dead bodies and worse, getting the dead LK to make appearances at these funerals. Complicating matters further are an inquisitive and greedy servant, the Prime Minister's fixer, a procurer of dead bodies, the paparazzi and for good measure a couple of cops. And of course internal jealousies, greed, rivalries within the family only add spice to the goings on. Buddha Mar Gaya takes you on a rip-roaring ride into a world littered with dead...

Article: Surprisingly, no one knows how many children receive education in English hospitals, still less the content or quality of that education. Proper records are just not kept. We know that more than 850,000 children go through hospital each year, and that every child of school age has a legal right to continue to receive education while in hospital. We also know there is only one hospital teacher to every 1,000 children in hospital. Little wonder the latest survey concludes that the extent and type of hospital teaching available differ a great deal across the country. It is found that half the hospitals in England which admit children have no teacher. A further quarter have only a part-time teacher. The special children's hospitals in major cities do best; general hospitals in the country and holiday areas are worst off. From this survey, one can estimate that fewer than one in five children have some contact with a hospital teacher--and that contact may be as little as two hours a day. Most children interviewed were surprised to find a teacher in hospital at all. They had not been prepared for it by parents or their own school. If there was a teacher they were much more likely to read books and do math or number work; without a teacher they would only play games. Reasons for hospital teaching range from preventing a child falling behind and maintaining the habit of school to keeping a child occupied, and the latter is often all the teacher can do. The position and influence of many teachers was summed up when parents referred to them as \\"the library lady\\" or just \\"the helper\\". Children tend to rely on concerned school friends to keep in touch with school work. Several parents spoke of requests for work being ignored or refused by the school. Once back at school children rarely get extra teaching, and are told to catch up as best they can. Many short-stay child-patients catch up quickly. But schools do very little to ease the anxiety about falling behind expressed by many of the children interviewed. Question: Which of the following statements is true?

(January 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Hazzard County is having a reunion festival, which includes a Toughman-style contest, and a rattlesnake chili cookoff, along with several other events. Uncle Jesse is the grand marshal of the reunion and at the same time, is facing a lawsuit filed by Mama Josephine Maxx for access across Duke property to the Hazzard swamp where she intends to build a theme park. However, Jesse refused access, not wanting to see the swamp destroyed. However, this has made the rest of the townsfolk angry with him, as the new theme park means new jobs, and revenue for Hazzard County. Driving from Washington, D.C., the Congressman representing Hazzard County in Washington, Cooter Davenport, arrives first and goes back to the Duke farm with Jesse, where Jesse is barbecuing ribs for everyone. Shortly thereafter, a car pulls up. Jesse recognizes it as Bo due to the sound of the motor. Bo has gotten a ride from a friend as he, having returned to the professional racing circuit and has come back for the reunion, has wrecked his car (again, according to Jesse). Bo introduces the girl who brought him home and after she leaves, Cooter says she was so good looking, it hurt and Bo joked with him, saying the girl wasn't bad either. Then Daisy arrives on a motorcycle. Daisy has been at graduate school getting a PhD in ecology after a bitter divorce. Then shortly after Luke, who has become a smokejumper for the forestry service, arrives on a fire truck. Luke stops to kiss one of his fellow firefighters, whom Cooter at first thinks is another guy, and wondering out loud how long Luke has been away from Hazzard. Then the other person's hat falls off, revealing a blonde-haired woman underneath the uniform, and the Dukes get a laugh at Cooter's expense.

(2). yes.","completion":"(1). No. These two sentences do not mean the same thing as there are essential differences in their construction and meaning. Let's analyze and compare each sentence. Sentence 1: \\"The unpredictable consonant of every word was then dropped, the distribution of first leaving.\\" In this sentence, the word 'unpredictable' is used as an adjective to describe the consonant that was dropped from every word. It implies that there is no pattern or rule for selecting which consonant to drop from each word. Consequently, the precise meaning of the sentence could be ambiguous as it lacks specific criteria to identify the consonants. Furthermore, the phrase 'the distribution of first leaving' is unclear and does not provide a clear context or reasoning for dropping the unpredictable consonants. Sentence 2: \\"The first consonant of every word was then dropped, the distribution of unpredictable leaving.\\" In this sentence, the word 'first' is used as an adjective to describe which consonant was dropped from every word. Unlike the first sentence, this statement provides a clear rule that the initial consonant of each word was removed. The phrase 'the distribution of unpredictable leaving' remains unclear but may imply that the process led to a distribution of words or phrases that are unpredictable. In summary, the main difference between the two sentences lies in the specification of which consonant was dropped. The first sentence's meaning is vague due to the absence of a clear rule, while the second sentence clearly states that the initial consonant was dropped from each word. Additionally, while both sentences include the phrase 'the distribution of unpredictable leaving,' it remains unclear and does not contribute to a clear understanding of the sentences' meanings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The teen hiker who was rescued after spending five days lost in a Californian national park has revealed she began eating dirt and hallucinating a snake was eating her during her ordeal. Suffering from hunger and severe dehydration, Kyndall Jack, 18, told reporters yesterday that her mind began to play tricks on her while lost near Trabuco Canyon after she and her friend, Nicolas Cendoya became lost after setting off on a hike on March 31st. Believing that all hope of rescue had gone, Jack said that she had wild thought her parents had been sentenced to prison time, a python was eating her and that Cendoya, 19, told her he was having visions of a tiger. Scroll Down for Video. Kyndall Jack, one of the two hikers who became lost for nearly a week in the Cleveland National Forest last week, talks about her ordeal and thanks rescuers during a news conference outside UCI Medical Center on Monday. Released from UC Irvine Medical Center on Monday, Jack was rescued shoeless and clinging to a mountain ledge on Thursday having suffered frostbite and cuts and bruises on her legs that made walking difficult for her. 'I don't remember drinking anything,' said Jack to ABC News. 'I know I ate dirt. I tried to eat some dirt and rocks. I came to the hospital with a big mouthful of dirt and that's all I remember.' Describing her hallucinations, Jack said that the wilderness got to her, making her imagine that animals were trying to attack her and her companion. 'My parents were in jail half the time, in my mind, and I was searching for my little sister, so that's all I remember,' said Jack. Kyndall Jack, told reporters that starvation and dehydration led to her eating dirt and hallucinating that she was being attacked by a snake while stuck on a ledge for five days. Kyndall Jack is transported by wheelchair and flanked by hospital staff, security and her parents for a press conference outside UCI Medical Center in Orange, California on Monday. 'I was being eaten by a python. Like Nick saw a tiger, I was being eaten by a python half the time.' Jack and Cendoya began their fateful trek on Easter Sunday in Trabuco Canyon in Southern Californian on what was their first date. It was while at the top of a mountain that took them six hours that the inexperienced hikers realized they had exhausted the water supply. 'We wanted to touch the clouds,' said Jack. 'That's why we went up there. We wanted to be in the clouds at the top.' And in newly released 911 calls made as the panicked pair realized they were stranded, Cendoya sounds incoherent. 'We have fire I mean,' Cendoya told the 911 operator according to ABC News. 'I mean we have a lighter or something we can light something up. I don't know.' Hero: Kyndall Jack, 18, has called Nicolas Cendoya, 19, pictured, her hero after the dramatic rescue. Relief: Nicolas Cendoya, center, hugs his brother, left, and mother, right, after he was released from Mission Hospital today. The 911 operator can be heard to struggle with Cendoya as he tries to find out where the pair have got themselves lost. 'Stop for one second. What is the address?' Cendoya can be overheard saying to Jack. 'I don't know,' she replies. Jack told reporters that the battery on Cendoya's cellphone failed before the 911 operator could track the signal - and that is when they began to panick. 'I said just hold onto me. Let's go back down the canyon,' Cendoya said Sunday after being released from hospital. 'And I must've fallen. And I don't know if Kyndall took a fall and was unconscious.' Once separated, the two were unaware even if the other one had survived. On Wednesday, Cendoya was found barefoot, shirtless and disorientated and Jack was found the next morning handing from a rocky ledge the size of a yoga mat. Following confusion over their accounts of how they became lost and separated, Cendoya said he was worried Kyndall Jack, 18, would blame him for what happened. He said he had been told not to contact her and was concerned when she hadn't got in touch, but then she sent him a Facebook message insisting his words of encouragement when they got lost were 'what kept me going' and that she loved him and missed him. Drama in the wild: Kyndall Jack, 18, is airlifted to safety by Los Angeles County Search and Rescue after being missing for five days in rugged country near Rancho Santa Margarita, California. 'I heard a lot of really mean things that were being said about me... and when she was saved I hadn't heard from her and everyone was telling me not to call,' Cendoya told reporters outside Mission Viejo hospital. 'But then I get a (Facebook) post from Kyndall.' Then he read out the heartfelt message. Risky adventure: Kyndall Jack's father said his daughter called him Sunday to say that she is going on a hike, which was unusual for her. 'Hi Nick, all I think about is you. It's hard to make sense of it all and everything that has happened,' she wrote, before explaining how when she was rescued, she wasn't even aware that she had been hiking with him. 'Then I remember you telling me to calm down and that you were going to get me out of there and that's what kept me going,' she went on. 'Thank you so much and I love you and miss you more than words can describe. You are my hero Nicolas.' Cendoya also described how he spent much of the ordeal in a dream-like state and even thought the search helicopters flying above him were hallucinations. 'The last thing I could tell you was going into a lucid dream,' he said. 'I can't even tell you when I woke up. I was in lucid dreams and hallucinations for days.' He said that while he was wandering in the arid surrounds, he reflected on what he considered recent selfish behaviors, like focusing too much on himself and not enough on his family. 'So that's why when all this happened, I didn't cry, I didn't fear it. I just embraced everything. I said, \\"This is what I deserve,\\"' Cendoya said. 'I just knew I would get through it. I knew this wasn't my time to die. I knew that I needed this, to become the person that I'm supposed to be.' Rescued: Miss Jack is being treated in hospital and her family have been notified that she is safe. The two teen hikers were just a couple of miles from a shopping mall, and were able to make out the Los Angeles skyline and hear the rumbles of downtown traffic from where they wandered off trail. And although the sprawling expanse of Southern California suburbia is clearly visible from the forest's ridgelines, in the canyon where they were trapped the brush was so thick they couldn't find a road that was just 500 feet away.

A:","completion":"A: In the United States, federal elections are held every two years, on the first Tuesday of November. The specific voting day is set by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and generally falls between November 2nd and November 8th. Federal elections comprise the election of the President and Vice President (held every four years), the U.S. House of Representatives, and the U.S. Senate. Presidential and Vice Presidential elections take place every four years, with the next scheduled for November 5, 2024. The President and Vice President serve a four-year term and are limited to two terms by the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Elections for the U.S. House of Representatives occur every two years on the same day as the general elections. There are 435 seats in the House, and each member serves a two-year term without term limits. After every national census (conducted every 10 years), the congressional district boundaries are reviewed and possibly redrawn to account for population shifts. The next elections for the U.S. House of Representatives are scheduled for November 8, 2022. U.S. Senate elections, on the other hand, are staggered to ensure continuity in government since senators serve six-year terms. Every two years, approximately one-third of the 100 Senate seats are up for election. As with the House, there are no term limits for senators. The next U.S. Senate elections are also scheduled for November 8, 2022. In addition to federal elections, various state and local elections take place across the country on the same day. These include races for governorships, state legislatures, and municipal offices, among others. Citizens might also vote on state-specific issues or referendums that affect their communities. To sum up, federal elections for the President, Vice President, U.S. House of Representatives, and U.S. Senate take place every two years on the first Tuesday of November. While the President and Vice President are elected every four years, members of the House serve two-year terms, and senators serve six-year terms. The elections are scheduled to ensure efficient governance and provide citizens with an opportunity to vote for their representatives in the federal government."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Kristen Stewart waited less than a day. Late yesterday, Us Weekly published photos of \\"steamy rendez-vous\\" between her and her Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders. By Hollywood standards, the affair is a big deal: Sanders is married with children and is twice Stewart's age—plus his wife Liberty Ross played Stewart's mother in the Snow White movie. Even more remarkable is the fact that Stewart for years has been dating Robert Pattinson, her co-star in the ridiculously popular Twilight series. As Vulture put it , \\"That sound you hear is a thousand Twilight: Breaking Dawn 2 publicists simultaneously breathing into a paper bag. Press tour should be ... interesting.\\" It took nearly three months for Tiger Woods to apologize after his multiple extra-marital affairs became public. Anthony Weiner waited a week after he unintentionally posted a lewd photo of himself on Twitter to say sorry for his R-rated use of social media. Singer-turned-actress LeAnn Rimes cheated on her husband with a co-star—and didn't publicly apologize until a year and a half later, after she'd been divorced and re-married. So it would have been completely normal for Stewart to stall the way Woods and Weiner and Rimes (and Meg Ryan and Mark Sanford and Ashton Kutcher and Bill Clinton) did when their infidelities came to light. She could have refused to speak to the press or said that the damning photos were a joke. But she didn't. By midday today, she issued the following apology: I'm deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I've caused to those close to me and everyone this has affected. This momentary indiscretion has jeopardized the most important thing in my life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love him, I'm so sorry. The apology is remarkable for a bunch of reasons: It seems heartfelt (\\"I love him, I love him, I'm so sorry\\" oozes far more contrition than Woods's stilted, rambling 2010 statement); it's revealing (Stewart had never officially acknowledged her relationship with Pattinson before); but most of all, it was fast. Has any high-profile cheater ever said sorry so quickly? Lots of factors could account for the apology's rawness and swiftness. A cynic would point out that Stewart has tremendous financial incentive to make this scandal go away as soon as possible. The last installment in the Twilight saga is scheduled to come out in November, and as Meg Ryan knows, a movie with an adulterous actress has a good chance of bombing. Perhaps in acknowledging and apologizing for the affair now, Stewart's hoping that her teenybopper audience will have the opportunity to mourn, rage, and then forget about the whole thing by the fall. But Stewart has never much cared what her audience thinks of her. She once said being a celebrity is like being raped—and in her subsequent apology shrugged, \\"I've made stupid remarks before, and I've always reasoned: 'Whatever. They can think what they want.'\\" She refuses to smile for the camera on the red carpet, and when she poses for magazine covers she often looks like she's got a gun pointed at her head. Unlike her peers Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez, she doesn't market herself as a role model. It's hard to imagine that she's had a change of heart and suddenly wants people to like her or to think of her as a paragon of chastity. In fact, Stewart's blase attitude toward her own image could explain why she apologized so quickly and with so much apparent emotion. She didn't try to see if she could trick the public into believing the affair didn't happen. She didn't wait for a damage-control expert's opinion on what sort of statement would sound best to her fans. She just wanted forgiveness, so she asked for it. ||||| Kristen Stewart cheated on Robert Pattinson with Snow White and the Huntsmen director Rupert Sanders. Rupert Sanders cheated on his wife Liberty Ross with Kristen Stewart. And both, under the spell of some mysterious PR draught, issued statements within minutes of each other apologizing to their cheatees. Breaking from her same-faced stare into the middle distance, Kristen Stewart released a statement pumped with all the desperate emotion and feelings one would expect from any 22-year-old apologizing for cheating on her boyfriend. She said: I'm deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I've caused to those close to me and everyone this has affected. This momentary indiscretion has jeopardized the most important thing in my life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love him, I'm so sorry. For a couple of on-set cuddle pics? Those require the kind of under-the-rug-brushing a PR intern could have managed. Why the honesty? Why the apology? Something wicked this way comes, for sure. Over and away across the pond, Rupert Sanders issued a far more stock apology statement: My beautiful wife and heavenly children are all I have in this world. I love them with all my heart. I am praying that we can get through this together Neither Pattinson nor Ross have responded to the public apologies, but if you hold still and remain very quiet, you can hear the sounds of thrown vases barely missing ducked heads and curdling shrieks of betrayal. Poor Robert Pattinson, how high his voice does get when he weeps. And what of the fans? The fans are beside themselves. [Via People, images from US Weekly] ||||| Today, on the heels of an impending US Weekly cover story revealing a scandalous affair with her married \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" director Rupert Sanders, Kristen Stewart issued a revelatory apology exclusively to People, in which she publicly professed her love for boyfriend Robert Pattinson for the first time. Sanders responded with an equally candid statement to People, wherein he apologized for the pain caused to his wife (model Liberty Ross) and their two young children. We couldn't help but wonder: What could cause this drop of bombshells? We enlisted the help of an entertainment PR contact, who shed some light on Wednesday's highly unorthodox turn of events. So this is all pretty crazy, huh? It smacks of being forced to do it -- did she come clean to Rob and he insisted she publicly apologize? Did Sanders' wife insist that they both publicly apologize? This is the sort of thing famous people generally don't acknowledge unless there's a divorce involved. There are scans of the US Weekly story online now. What do you think of the photos? Why don't people just get hotel rooms like they used to? And this is really the first time Kristen has officially admitted she and Rob are a couple. I think that's part of the mystery -- why is she acknowledging it now? So what's your take on both Stewart and Sanders' statements to People? What's interesting is that neither statement goes for the traditional \\"This is a very difficult and personal time and I ask everyone to respect my family's privacy.\\" This feels like something she may have conceivably written herself. Those statements are always worked over by a team of people. What everyone is calling out is what's accurate -- that it's strangely authentic-sounding. So why make any statement at all, authentic or otherwise? Presumably, Us Weekly wouldn't kill the story, as I can only assume they tried to do. People is a safe place. They ran her statement with the barest of facts, and no editorializing on the nature of the affair. It also helps set them up as the ones to talk to her as the scandal unfolds. Do you think there's something additional that'll unfold from this? Perhaps, a pregnancy? Oh God, I hope not. I'm sure it adds fuel to the fire for those who assumed that Kristen was Rob's beard for the past several years. If she's been acting as his beard, this is an easy way to break them up around the time that the [\\"Twilight\\"] franchise ends. People have said that from the beginning. It's doubly shocking because everyone has presumed that Rob and Kristen have been dating for the past four years, but they've never officially acknowledged it until what happened today. I believe they've just started to tentatively talk about their relationship publicly. Which is why it smacks of something like, \\"If you want to stay with me, you need to publicly apologize.\\" The bottom line is that it feels like high school drama. Do you think Stewart's PR team is botching things with this? One could argue that Kristen Stewart has showed more emotion and likeability in the past 24 hours than she has in years. I think it's calculated to make her look sympathetic in the wake of cheating on her long-term boyfriend, but other than that, I still think someone is making her publicly apologize. What about that, \\"I love him, I love him\\" line? Kind of dramatic, no? Absolutely. It's that detail that makes people think it's actually from her, and not just a stock apology. So under what circumstances does issuing a public apology like this -- so frank and seemingly heartfelt -- make sense? There doesn't seem to be any reason for her to be this candid. Which is why I suspect it was a condition of saving everyone's relationships. It's as though my high school boyfriend cheated on me, begged my forgiveness, and I made him stand up on the cafeteria table and admit to everyone that he had been an asshole, you know? So you think that's all it is -- pressure from Pattinson and/or Sanders' wife to publicly apologize? ‪From my standpoint, yes. I can't see how this would successfully hide something else. Roughly how many gallons of alcohol do you think Stewart's PR team is going to go through after today? So. Many. How does a PR team brace themselves for the media onslaught of something like this? The nice thing is that, from here on out, she's not going to do interviews until she has to. She's not going to comment, so all they can do is say \\"no\\" right now. So they got pretty lucky with the timing of this US Weekly piece, considering the fact that she's not mid-promotion of any films at the moment? They did. She also hates doing interviews, so now she can do the standard couple of talk shows, press conference at the junket, TV interviews at the junket, and no 1:1s, and call it a day. So what do you think this means for \\"Snow White and the Huntsman 2,\\" since Sanders and Stewart are both currently on board? Think Stewart will back out? If anything, Rupert is easier to get rid of. The classy thing is for him to step aside. ||||| As you have perhaps heard, the new issue of Us Weekly drops quite the scoop: Kristen Stewart has been cheating on her boyfriend Robert Pattinson. Cheating with Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders, no less, who is a married man with two kids. This cool drink of gossip in the celebrity summer desert comes complete with damning photos and, in the ultimate admittance of guilt, Stewart has issued a public apology for cheating on her sparklevamp lover. Which is utter nonsense. Advertisement Says Stewart (via a rep, of course): I'm deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I've caused to those close to me and everyone this has affected. This momentary indiscretion has jeopardized the most important thing in my life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love him, I'm so sorry. It's not the first time a celebrity has apologized for their infidelities. Kobe Bryant was accused of sexually assaulting a hotel employee while on the road in 2003; he denied the charges, asserting that the sex was consensual — and so he issued a public apology to the general public and his wife, Vanessa, for the indiscretion (the charges were dropped and Vanessa got a 4 million, 8-carat diamond ring for the inconvenience). In 2009, David Letterman issued an on-air apology for cheating on his wife with an intern. Tiger Woods publicly begged for forgiveness in 2010 for cheating on his wife with a whole slew of women, and that same year Jesse James apologized for screwing over Sandra Bullock while screwing another woman. To name a few. (And let's not even get started on the adulterous-then-so-sorry politicians.) Advertisement All of these incidents have the same plot line: grown man cheats on his wife, feels bad, is really sorry. But something about Kristen Stewart's apology doesn't sit right. Stars apologize for bad behavior all the time and whether they're genuinely sorry or not doesn't even matter. Celebrities just need to keep their loyal fans loyal enough to keep opening their wallets. In that regard, the stakes here are high; this is the Twilight franchise we're talking about. But seriously, this isn't going to hurt business (the added element of real-life drama might actually help, not that Twilight needs any). As for the matter of Stewart being \\"the other woman,\\" no amount of apologizing will likely win back the small handful of fans who blackball her because they believe her behavior is unforgivable, so a public repentance about that part — and it's fair to assume she's apologizing for that, too — is kind of pointless from a business perspective (and remember, this public apology routine is all about business). So let's take adultery out of the public-display-of-contrition equation. This is the matter of a girl cheating on her boyfriend, and that kind of feels like a high school fuck up. Fodder for the gossip mill, sure, but not at the level of publicly begging for forgiveness. Even the overwrought apology (your boyfriend is \\"the most important thing in my life\\" — really?) sounds like a kid with a case of the swoons. Kristen Stewart is 22, a very young adult. Find me one person who didn't screw up, in ways large or small, a relationship at that age. And Robert Pattinson is just her boyfriend, as in they aren't married. I am no Kristen Stewart fan — the polar opposite, in fact — but I almost feel bad for her that she has to go through that sort of awful \\"teachable moment\\" so publicly (even if what she did was exceptionally stupid, even if I believe playing the tabloid game is now part of a celebrity's job, even if I acknowledge being complicit in that game). Moreover, Stewart exists in a very permissive Hollywood bubble where celebrities can generally behave however they please, and she didn't violate the sanctity of some social/legal contract. Nor was she involved in any criminal acts (as far as we know, anyhow, but there could've been some hot Bonnie and Clyde role playing); adultery isn't illegal in California. And who the hell knows the state of her relationship? That press release is boilerplate. According to the tabloids — which are positively renowned for their accurate insight into the private lives of the rich and famous — Rob was cheating, they were ready to build a happy family, they totally broke up, they're planning the wedding of the year, and god only knows what else. Advertisement None of this makes Stewart's behavior even remotely excusable because it's not, not even if the relationship is on the rocks or he's the world's most popular vampire. Say it with me: Cheating is wrong! Kristen Stewart Did a Bad Thing. She acted like a crappy person. But she did it to her boyfriend, and she's young, and chances are she's learned her lesson. Assuming Pattinson and Stewart's relationship was in an otherwise happy place full of hearts doodled on notebooks, she certainly does owe him an apology. She doesn't, however, owe him — or any of us — a press release. Stupid girl did something stupid. The end. But don't get me started on Sanders. That guy's a piece of shit. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short version of a longer text, story, or event that explains the main points in a clear and concise way.

Translation efficiency in this expression system was enhanced significantly by employing the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 5'-untranslated region (UTR) which confers cap-independent translation by directing internal initiation of translation. The enhancement was accomplished by fusing open reading frames (ORFs) to the N terminus of the EMCV polyprotein coding region, thus utilizing its highly efficient translation initiation site. Expression vectors were constructed to allow cloning in all three reading frames. As reporter genes, we used the IucZ gene and a number of genes encoding coronavirus structural proteins: among others the genes encoding glycoproteins with N-terminal signal sequences. The signal sequences of these glycoproteins are located internally in the primary translation product. We demonstrated that this did not interfere with translocation and glycosylation and yields biologically active proteins.

Write some highlights for the following article: If you believe the talking heads, it sounds like the worst of the worst is over for the \\"Great Recession.\\" Joseph Kennedy, Sr., left, and son John F. Kennedy in 1938. Whether or not that's true, it doesn't mean that everyone is suffering or has suffered. Even during our country's worst economic downturn, some folks still knew how to make a buck -- many bucks, in fact. 1. Babe Ruth. The Sultan of Swat was never shy about conspicuous consumption. While baseball players' salaries were nowhere near as high in the '30s as they are today (adjusted for inflation), Ruth was at the top of the heap. While possibly apocryphal, when Ruth found out that his 80,000 (more than 1 million today) a year salary was 5,000 more than that of President Hoover, he is reported to have said, \\"Well, I had a better year than he did.\\" 2. John Dillinger. While not using methods we'd endorse, John Dillinger and his compatriots managed to compile more than 3 million in today's dollars. Robbing dozens of banks and killing police officers in the process, Dillinger is not exactly what we'd call \\"successful,\\" but the brash, charming, and audacious Dillinger became just the type of anti-hero that the bedraggled, unemployed masses loved. He was shot to death in Chicago by FBI agents in 1934. 3. Michael J. Cullen. A man unfamiliar to most, yet whose modern ideas revolutionized American life, Cullen changed our retail landscape by creating the modern supermarket. A former executive at Kroger Grocery & Bakery Co., Cullen struck out on his own in 1930 after higher-ups rejected his ideas for more suburban, larger, self-serve food markets with room for automobile parking and allowances for new-fangled home refrigeration. Within two years, Cullen's stores (known as King Kullen Grocery) were doing more than 6 million in revenue (more than 75 million today). His motto: \\"Pile it high: sell it cheap.\\" Mental Floss: How the Depression gave rise to soap operas. 4. James Cagney. The diminutive song-and-dance man turned tough guy turned song-and-dance man rose like a rocket through Hollywood in the 1930s. He went from a 500-a-week contract player in 1930 to one of the top ten moneymakers in Hollywood during 1935. In 1933 he was making the equivalent of 40,000 a week. His rise was so fast that he offered to do a few movies for free just to get out of a five-year contract with Warner Brothers. 5. Charles Darrow. Finding himself out of work after the crash of '29, Darrow spent a few years perfecting -- though some would say pilfering -- a little parlor game that eventually came to be known as Monopoly. Within a year of registering the patent, Parker Brothers was selling 20,000 units a year, and Darrow became the world's first millionaire game designer. 6. J. Paul Getty. An amazing beneficiary of good timing and great business acumen, Getty created an oil empire out an inheritance of 500,000 received in 1930. With oil stocks massively depressed, he snatched them up at bargain prices and created an oil conglomerate to rival Rockefeller. Throughout the 20th century he became a billionaire many times over. Mental Floss: The kidnapping of Getty's grandson. 7. Glenn Miller. The King of Swing may have been Benny Goodman, but the King of Pop in the 1930s was Glenn Miller. From his humble beginnings as a traveling trombone player -- and superb high school football player being named \\"best left end in Colorado\\" -- Miller rose to put together his first band in 1937. The band fell apart. Undaunted as any good left end would be, he reorganized a new group in 1938 and quickly found success. With hits like \\"In the Mood,\\" \\"String Of Pearls,\\" and \\"Moonlight Serenade,\\" Miller and his band found themselves on radio, in the movies and commanding a salary of nearly 20,000 a week. In 1942, just at the height of his popularity, Miller disbanded his group and volunteered for the U.S. Army, where he formed a military band to help build morale during the war. He was lost during a flight over the channel from England to France in 1944. The plane was never found. 8. Howard Hughes. Sure, all we remember of Hughes is the insanely long fingernails, Kleenex box hats, and storing his own urine in mayonnaise jars, but there was a whole crazy stellar career before that. After the '29 crash, seemingly unfazed, he made \\"Hell's Angels\\" -- then the most expensive movie ever -- at a cost of 3.8 million. In 1932, at the height of the nation's economic woes, he formed the Hughes Aircraft Company. He built the company into a major-league defense supplier and by the time he died in 1976, his fortune totaled a reported 2.5 billion. Maybe there's something to that whole urine saving thing. 9. Gene Autry. The Great Depression was Gene Autry's golden era. Rising from a local radio yodeler (nearly every station had their own yodeler back then) to a hit machine throughout the decade, Autry appeared in over 40 movies, becoming the top western draw at the box office. The singing cowboy, not content to be just a yodeler, albeit a very successful one, later created a TV and radio broadcasting empire in the Western United States and bought the California Angels. Mental Floss: 7 ridiculous products licensed by MLB. 10. Joe Kennedy. Joe Kennedy, Sr., patriarch of the Camelot clan, built up a tidy sum in the 1920s with a hearty amount of speculation, peppered with insider trading and market manipulation. Unlike many other of his ilk who helped to create the unstable markets that brought about the financial calamities of the '30s however, Kennedy knew when to get out. Out of the stock market, Old Joe invested his money in real estate, liquor, and movie studios, generating gaudy profits and cementing his family's place in the highest financial echelon of American society.

During the comeback portion of his career, Phoenix went back to his given name Joaquin and was often cast in supporting roles as conflicted, insecure characters with a dark side. In 1995, he co-starred in To Die For, as the disturbed young man Jimmy who gets seduced by Suzanne Stone (Nicole Kidman) to commit murder. Directed by Gus Van Sant, the film was screened out of competition at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival and became a financial and critical success, resulting in a domestic box office total of 21 million. New York Times critic Janet Maslin praised Phoenix's performance, writing \\"So pity poor Jimmy. Rivetingly played by Mr. Phoenix with a raw, anguished expressiveness that makes him an actor to watch for, Jimmy is both tempted and terrified by Suzanne's slick amorality. In that, he speaks for us all.\\" In 1997, Phoenix played a small-town troublemaker in Oliver Stone's U Turn, and a poor man in love with a rich woman in Inventing the Abbotts. The films were received with mostly mixed and negative reviews, respectively, and neither performed well at the box office. The following year, Phoenix starred in Clay Pigeons (1998) as a young man in a small town who befriends a serial killer. Budgeted at 8 million, the film became a box office flop, grossing only 1 million and was, like Phoenix's previous projects, not well received by critics. In his next film, 8mm (1999), Phoenix co-starred as an adult video store employee who helps Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) penetrate the underworld of illegal pornography. The film turned out be a box office success, grossing 96 million worldwide, but found few admirers among critics.

Why does there exist such a difference? First of all,food systems between China and West are different.Chinese put into practice Gather Dining System;westerners put into practice Individual Dining System.Everybody can share the delicious food of all over the table when eating Chinese food.Please note it is sharing,but westerners just eat the food in one's own plate.If you eat beef and he eats chicken,it is impossible that you taste the flavor of his chicken.The result of the Individual Dining System is that you can only eat the food in your plate.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Goal: How can you remove excess moisture before caulking your tub? Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"Considering that you haven't provided a list of methods, I will suggest some appropriate techniques for removing excess moisture before caulking your tub, and then discuss their effectiveness. 1. Air-drying: This is the simplest method for removing excess moisture. Open windows and doors in the bathroom to ensure proper airflow, and wait for the area to dry naturally. You can speed up the process by using a fan to direct air towards the area. This method may take a bit longer, but it requires minimal efforts and equipment. 2. Using a hairdryer: A hairdryer can be used to speed up the process of air-drying. Set it to the highest heat setting and direct the airflow towards the area needing to dry. Keep the dryer at a safe distance to prevent damage to the tub or surrounding fixtures. This method is effective, but use caution when operating electrical appliances near water. 3. Using towels or a squeegee: This method involves using clean towels or a squeegee to manually remove the excess moisture from the tub and surrounding surfaces. Although this method can make the area appear dry, it is not as effective as other methods in removing the moisture from hard-to-reach places like corners or below the rim of the tub. 4. Using a dehumidifier: A dehumidifier can be placed in the bathroom to reduce the humidity levels, which will accelerate the drying process. This method requires purchasing or renting a dehumidifier, and it may take longer than other methods depending on the humidity levels in your bathroom. 5. Using a heat gun: A heat gun is a tool that can be used to dry out small areas very quickly. Direct the heat gun at the area you need to dry and move it around slowly. However, be cautious while using a heat gun, as it can cause damage to the tub or surrounding fixtures if used incorrectly. Among these methods, using a hairdryer and air-drying with the help of a fan are the most reasonable options for removing excess moisture before caulking your tub. These methods are efficient, safe, and do not require any additional investments in equipment. Both methods work by accelerating the evaporation of moisture from the surface. While air-drying with a fan requires more time, it is a low-risk option to ensure the area is completely dry before caulking. On the other hand, using a hairdryer can speed up the drying process but requires constant attention and care to prevent any accidents or damage. Consider using one of these methods or a combination of both to ensure that the tub and surrounding areas are completely dry before caulking. This will ensure proper adhesion of the caulk, resulting in a watertight seal that lasts."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Falkland Islands wolf (\\"Dusicyon australis\\"), also known as the warrah and occasionally as the Falkland Islands dog, Falkland Islands fox, or Antarctic wolf, was the only native land mammal of the Falkland Islands. This endemic canid became extinct in 1876, the first known canid to have become extinct in historical times. It was the only modern species in the genus \\"Dusicyon\\". - The American mink (\\"Neovison vison\\") is a semiaquatic species of mustelid native to North America, though human intervention has expanded its range to many parts of Europe and South America. Because of range expansion, the American mink is classed as a least-concern species by the IUCN. Since the extinction of the sea mink, the American mink is the only extant member of the genus \\"Neovison\\". The American mink is a carnivore which feeds on rodents, fish, crustaceans, frogs, and birds. In its introduced range in Europe it has been classified as an invasive species linked to declines in European mink, Pyrenean desman, and water vole populations. It is the most frequently farmed animal for its fur, exceeding the silver fox, sable, marten, and skunk in economic importance. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - An invasive species is a plant, fungus, or animal species that is not native to a specific location (an introduced species), and which has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health. - The martens constitute the genus Martes within the subfamily Mustelinae, in the family Mustelidae. Martens are slender, agile animals, adapted to living in taigas, and are found in coniferous and northern deciduous forests across the Northern Hemisphere. They have bushy tails, and large paws with partially retractible claws. The fur varies from yellowish to dark brown, depending on the species, and, in many cases, is valued by fur trappers. - Skunks are mammals known for their ability to spray a liquid with a strong odor. Different species of skunk vary in appearance from black-and-white to brown or cream colored, but all have warning coloration. - The sea mink (\\"Neovison macrodon\\") is an extinct North American member of the family Mustelidae. It is the only mustelid, and one of only two terrestrial mammal species in the order Carnivora known to have become extinct in historic times (the other being the Falkland Islands wolf). The body of the sea mink was significantly longer than that of the closely related American mink (\\"N. vison\\"), and also bulkier, leading to a pelt that was almost twice the size of the other species. The longest specimen recorded was said to be . The sea mink produced a distinctive odor, and had fur that was said to be coarser and redder than the American mink's. - The Mustelidae (from Latin \\"mustela\\", weasel) are a family of carnivorous mammals, including the weasel, badger, otter, marten, ferret, mink, stoat, and wolverine. Mustelids are diverse and the largest family in the order Carnivora. The internal classification is still disputed, with rival proposals containing between two and eight subfamilies. One study, published in 2008, questions the long-accepted Mustelinae subfamily, and suggests that the Mustelidae consist of four major clades and three much smaller lineages. - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - The sable (\\"Martes zibellina\\") is a marten species, a small carnivorous mammal inhabiting forest environments, primarily in Russia from the Ural Mountains throughout Siberia, eastern Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, China, North and South Korea and Hokkaid in Japan. Its range in the wild originally extended through European Russia to Poland and Scandinavia. It has historically been hunted for its highly valued dark brown or black fur, which remains a luxury good to this day. While hunting of wild animals is still common in Russia, most fur in the market is now commercially farmed. - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - The Pyrenean desman (\\"Galemys pyrenaicus\\") is a small semiaquatic nocturnal mammal related to moles and shrews, and is one of only two surviving species of the tribe Desmanini. The range of the species centers on northwestern Spain and northern Portugal, but it is under threat due to changes to its habitat. In Portugal it's called \\"\\"toupeira-d'água\\"\\" which means \\"water mole\\". - A vole is a small rodent; a relative of the mouse, with a stouter body, a shorter, hairy tail, a slightly rounder head, smaller ears and eyes, and differently formed molars (high-crowned and with angular cusps instead of low-crowned and with rounded cusps). There are approximately 155 species of voles. They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America and Australia. Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats. - Neovison is a genus of mustelids , including the extinct sea mink and the extant American mink . - Carnivora (from Latin \\"car\\" (stem \\"carn-\\") \\"flesh\\" and \\"vorre\\" \\"to devour\\") is a diverse order that includes over 280 species of placental mammals. Its members are formally referred to as carnivorans, whereas the word \\"carnivore\\" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. Carnivorans are the most diverse in size of any mammalian order, ranging from the least weasel (\\"Mustela nivalis\\"), at as little as and , to the polar bear (\\"Ursus maritimus\\"), which can weigh up to , to the southern elephant seal (\\"Mirounga leonina\\"), whose adult males weigh up to and measure up to in length.

Claire is shocked to discover Tom, whose real name is Ronald Chapman, was a covert military operative serving in the United States Marine Corps and has been on the run for the past twelve years. Tom admits he was present at the scene of the mass murders but staunchly denies any involvement in the killings. He insists he has been scapegoated in order to conceal the identity of the real culprit, Major James Hernandez (Juan Carlos HernÃ¡ndez), now the aide of Brigadier General Bill Marks (Bruce Davison). First Lieutenant Terence Embry (Adam Scott) is assigned to defend Tom, but his youth and lack of experience prompt Claire to decide to defend her husband, as well. When she realizes she needs help from someone familiar with the workings of a military court, she hires Charlie Grimes (Morgan Freeman), an embittered former military attorney who has a grudge against the military brass, to assist her. Three of the five key witnesses, who previously testified Tom was guilty, have died under seemingly mysterious circumstances, raising Claire and Charlie's suspicions. As the trial proceeds, they uncover a massive cover-up perpetrated by one of the military's highest-ranking officials.

There's no shortage of harrowing stories of life under Islamist militants in northern Mali. Public floggings for smoking a cigarette. Brutal beatings for working as a radio journalist. Broken limbs. Broken hearts. \\"For the Islamists, a human being is like an ant you squash, like an animal you slaughter,\\" said Sedou Sangare, a resident of the northern town of Gao. Read more: What's behind the instability in Mali? Gao was once a vibrant community filled with colorful camel caravans lazily strolling down the streets. Bearded men and beaded women mingled freely. Then the Islamists rode in on rundown pickup trucks, armed to the teeth. They banned smoking, television, sports and music -- a major setback for the northern region known for its \\"Festival au Desert.\\" They forbade unwed men and women from mixing in public. An offensive led by France is aiming to stop the militants from expanding their reach to the capital of Mali. But the north remains under the Islamists' iron grip. Read more: United States, Italy lend support for French in Mali. 'Everybody panicked' Though Gao has a majority Muslim population, most residents practice a more relaxed form of the religion. After militants started imposing a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia, throngs took to the streets in protest. \\"When they declared Sharia, everybody panicked,\\" Sangare said. \\"Christians, Muslims, everybody fled.\\" But the protests did not deter the militants, who publicly punished anyone who defied their teachings. Read more: 'Many deaths' as Malians, joined by French, try to beat back Islamist militants. In August last year, they forced a couple allegedly having an affair into two holes and stoned them to death as terrified residents quietly watched. Lists of public and cruel punishments grew. Floggings, executions, amputations -- all in full view of aghast residents. The Islamists compiled a list of unmarried mothers, saying Sharia law condemns relationships outside marriage. A mayor -- and his people -- displaced. Mayor Sadou Diallo misses residents of his desert town of Gao, most of whom fled to Bamako when militants took over. About 229,000 Malians have been displaced -- mainly from Kidal, Timbuktu, and Gao, according to the United Nations. He is one of the displaced. A former respected community leader, trying to rebuild, just like his people. Residents of the north, once proud of the vibrant desert communities near River Niger, say the region is a shadow of what it used to be. Read more: France determined to 'eradicate' terrorism in Mali, official says. \\"Home is not sweet anymore,\\" said Fadimata Alainchar, a charity worker and native of nearby Timbuktu. A recent visit to her hometown left her shaken. \\"When entering the city, the signboard which was: \\"Welcome to Timbuktu the City of 333 Saints\\" is now \\"Welcome to Timbuktu, the gate to the application of the Shariya,\\" she said in a submission to CNN's iReport. The fabled city includes ancient tombs and wooden structures dating to the 15th century, a major part of its cultural heritage. And those are not the only changes. Women who don't cover their bodies in accordance to the militants' Sharia law, are imprisoned or raped, she said. Their husbands, terrified of killings and amputations, don't utter a word. And gunshots are a common sound. \\"If not to disperse women marching, it is to kill dogs that are barking and preventing the insurgents from sleeping,\\" Alainchar said. \\"Home has changed. Before it was peace, joy and love. Now it is shame, terror and abuse.\\" Read more: At least 37 hostages killed in Algeria gas plant standoff, prime minister says. \\"I prefer dying\\" Stories of cruel punishments abound. Radio journalist Malik Maiga faced the militants' wrath when he used his show to warn residents of public stoning or floggings. Islamists singled him out, beat him up and left him in a cemetery. He survived and is among the displaced in Bamako. Maiga is not the only journalist targeted. Last week, another radio journalist was killed, leading Gao residents to retaliate by killing a militant leader. Then there's Suleyman and Muktar, former truck drivers, accused of stealing. Their limbs were hacked off. They are jobless and wander around the capital. \\"I prefer dying to being like this,\\" Muktar said. \\"My hand hurts, my heart aches. I only have God to ask for help.\\" Mali descended into chaos last year, when junior military members seized power in a coup. Outraged soldiers accused the government of not providing adequate equipment to battle ethnic Tuareg rebels roaming the vast desert in the north. Tuareg rebels took advantage of the power vacuum after the coup and seized some parts of the north. A power struggle erupted between the rebels and local Islamists, leading the latter to topple the tribe and seize control of two-thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of France. Hope amid chaos. The crisis in the north has prompted fears that the al Qaeda-linked extremists will set up shop there. It is \\"a serious, ongoing threat,\\" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned Wednesday. The French offensive to help the government in its former colony aims to stop the militants from using the vast desert area as a training ground for international attacks. \\"We are in for a struggle. We cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe haven\\" for terrorists, Clinton said. International troops from West African nations such as Nigeria are joining the effort to restore some normalcy to the north. Amid the strife and despair, citizens of the former French colony remain hopeful. And as French combat helicopters fly overhead, crowds below erupt into cheers. But in northern Mali, at least for now, there is little to smile about. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"This story is about how life has become very difficult for people in northern Mali because some bad people called Islamist militants have taken control there. These bad people have many rules that make life less fun and more scary for everyone. They do not allow smoking, television, sports, and music, which upsets lots of people. The Islamist militants are also very mean, as they hurt and punish people who do not follow their rules. For example, they have hurt radio journalists and even killed a couple who were having an affair. Because of these mean actions, many people are afraid and have left their homes to go to safer places.

Summarize: The important thing to watch here is not so much the corruption counts, or \\"exchanging power and money for sex\\", (lurid though these allegations are), but the charge of \\"intentional disclosure of state secrets\\". The Supreme People's Court annual work report said \\"Zhou undermined party solidarity and engaged in political activities not approved by the authorities\\". The People's Daily declared him a \\"traitor to the party\\". State media have reported secret meetings between Zhou Yongkang and disgraced former Chongqing Communist Party Secretary Bo Xilai, railing against the formation of factions and cliques. It looks as if the case against Mr Zhou may centre on the torrid spring and summer of 2012 which saw many strange goings on before the triumphant coronation of Xi Jinping at the 18th Party Congress. What do you think of when you watch a raindrop roll off a lotus leaf? Whatever it is, next time think that little bit harder and you could become another Zhou Qunfei. This week, the rags to riches story of the former Hunanese factory worker went viral when she became China's wealthiest woman. Her company, Lens Technology, produces touch-screen glass for tech giants like Apple and Samsung. And the breakthrough innovation was scratch resistant glass inspired by watching raindrops on lotus leaves in her home village. A fortnight ago her company debuted on the Shenzhen stock exchange, and the share price has surged since. So at 45, the migrant worker whose mother died when she was little and whose father was blinded in an industrial accident, is worth nearly 8bn (Â£5.4bn). If Ms Zhou has time to write the next self help book on thinking big, getting rich and changing your destiny, I'm sure she'll find a market. If one woman's China Dream has come true, the nation's top bankers are working hard on another. This week saw applications close for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Now don't roll your eyes and moan that you've already heard all that you can bear about this bank. It matters. And it's great theatre. Away from the chief protagonists in Beijing and chief antagonists in Washington, spare a thought for the fevered brinkmanship in other capitals. At the last minute, Taiwan suddenly announced that it was applying to join. Cue all the predictable contortions over names and protocol. Would it join as the Republic of China, Taiwan, or Taipei, China? And would the Ministry of Finance handle the application as for sovereign states or the Taiwan Affairs Office in a nod to the \\"one China\\" principle so jealously guarded by Beijing? \\"The AIIB is open and inclusive,\\" said a spokesman. \\"We welcome Taiwan to participate in the AIIB under an appropriate name.\\" It remains to be seen what that name is and whether it will be acceptable to the Taiwanese public. There were no consultations before the announcement and critics accused the Taiwanese government of striking another \\"black box\\" agreement with China, a reference to the row over a cross-straits trade agreement which blew up into a major protest movement a year ago. Can Beijing be flexible enough about its red lines to help Taiwan in? It's not just Taiwan. What about other applicants? Norway for example? Relations between Beijing and Oslo have been icy ever since the political dissident Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize nearly five years ago. But this is supposed to be a multilateral institution and it's China's first attempt to run one. Will it set national political considerations aside when considering AIIB applications? Place your bets. At the end of Act One of this drama, there are nearly 50 countries lined up behind China on the AIIB stage, with the US looking isolated in its opposition. Another story about national agenda in conflict with international image was this week's attack on GitHub, a San Francisco-based service used by programmers and tech firms to develop software. The distributed denial of service attack directed a huge volume of traffic from China's search giant Baidu to GitHub in an apparent attempt to paralyse its website. The anti-censorship organisation greatfire.org accused the Cyberspace Administration of China of involvement. \\"The Great Firewall has switched from being a passive, inbound filter to being an active and aggressive outbound oneâ€¦ enforcing Chinese censorship on internet users worldwide,\\" it said. The Chinese government dismissed such charges as speculation and said China was a major victim of cyber attacks. Now to the beach. US Pacific fleet Commander Admiral Harry Harris Jr has waded into the choppy waters of the South China Sea debate, accusing Beijing of building a \\"great wall of sand\\" over areas claimed by others. \\"When one looks at China's pattern of provocative actions towards smaller claimant states - the lack of clarity on its sweeping nine-dash line claim that is inconsistent with international law, and the deep asymmetry between China's capabilities and those of its smaller neighbours - it's no surprise that the scope and pace of building man-made islands raises serious questions about Chinese intentions.\\" These are questions which the admiral himself will have to answer. And some kind of answer came in the warning that he was on track to have 60% of the US Navy based in the Pacific Fleet by 2020. Summary:","completion":"The narrative above touches upon several key stories relating to recent political and economic occurrences in China. First, it discusses the case of Zhou Yongkang, a former high-ranking official within the Chinese government. He was charged specifically with \\"intentional disclosure of state secrets,” amongst other things, but the charge of intentionality is most alarming, leading to accusations of treason. These charges appear to be centered around Zhuo's actions during a turbulent period in 2012, prior to Xi Jinping's rise to power. The narrative then shifts to the inspiring journey of Zhou Qunfei, a former factory worker who became China's wealthiest woman through her company, Lens Technology. The company makes touch-screen glass for well-known companies such as Apple and Samsung, with Zhou Qunfei's net worth reaching a staggering 8 billion. The story also touches on the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), a new multilateral financial institution proposed by China. Many countries have shown interest in joining this bank but the process is mired in political complications, especially when considering positions of Taiwan, Norway, and the US. Taiwan’s application to join the bank has reignited territorial disputes, while Norway's relationship with China has been strained since a Chinese political dissident was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize nearly five years ago. Moreover, the story mentions a cyber attack involving China's search giant, Baidu, and GitHub, an international software development platform based in San Francisco. An organization, greatfire.org, has accused China's Cyberspace Administration of involvement in the attack. However, the Chinese government has dismissed these claims, countering that China is a significant victim of cyber attacks itself. Lastly, the piece moves to the issue of territorial claims in the South China Sea. The US Pacific Fleet Commander, Admiral Harry Harris Jr, has raised concerns about China's activities in the region, particularly it's construction of man-made islands, which are perceived as provocative actions that contradict international laws."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

News article: Wildfires destroy at least a dozen homes in spread from Utah to Idaho A firefighter with the Idaho City Hotshots looks for spot fires while battling the more than 90,000-acre Elk Fire Complex near Pine. Photograph: Ashley Smith/AP A lightning-sparked wildfire has destroyed at least a dozen homes and threatens hundreds of others near a Utah resort town. The blaze near Park City was among several in the West, where fires have devoured dry grass and brush and burned to the edges of small communities in several states. Health officials were monitoring air quality in areas that have been blanketed by smoke for days. Shifting winds in Utah pushed the fire toward homes in the Lake Rockport Estates subdivision about 10 miles outside of town, said Steve Rutter, a fire management officer with the state, who spoke at a news conference late Tuesday. \\"We have homes that are completely surrounded by black, vegetation completely gone. But we were able to preserve the homes,\\" he said. \\"It looks really ugly right now. It's a big black spot but there are still a lot of people who will be able to go home when we open it back up.\\" About 250 homes were still \\"imminently threatened\\", he said. Utah governor Gary Herbert confirmed that homes had burned late Tuesday and said the fire has grown to 4,000 acres, or more than six square miles. It is 5% contained. Two Black Hawk helicopters will be used to fight the fire Wednesday. More than 100 people were assigned to help fight the fire. Evacuations were expected to remain in place until at least Wednesday evening. Russ Moseley chose to stay in his home and fight back flames with a garden hose as it came within 150ft, he told the Salt Lake Tribune. He said he could feel the heat radiating on his face and saw the fire swallow homes below his and blow up propane tanks. \\"It's like being in Vietnam,\\" Moseley said. In west-central Utah's Skull Valley, more than 20 structures were threatened by the Patch Springs Fire that covered some 16 square miles. No evacuations had been ordered. More than 200 firefighters were working to contain the largest blaze in Utah, which has jumped at least 6 miles across the border into Idaho. The lightning-caused State Fire has charred almost 33 square miles in steep and rugged terrain. Nationwide, there were 35 large active fires burning Tuesday, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise. All were in the West. Even so, fewer than 3m acres have been burned by US wildfires this year, NIFC reported, well below the 5.9m acres that had burned by this time last year and 6.3m acres that had burned through mid-August in 2011. In Idaho, fire crews prepared to capitalize on favorable winds and lower temperatures to continue burnout operations around the small mountain community of Pine, where the Elk Complex remained the nation's top firefighting priority. The lightning-caused fire had burned across more than 140 square miles, fire spokeswoman Ludie Bond said. No buildings burned overnight Monday, though fire officials were still tallying structure losses in the community of Fall Creek. Pine and the neighboring mountain hamlet of Featherville, eight miles from the flames, remained threatened. A wildfire near Glenwood Springs, Colorado, prompted a small number of evacuations Tuesday, Garfield County sheriff's office spokesman Walter Stowe said. About 60 firefighters were battling the Red Canyon fire with help from aircraft. The dry conditions were prompting warnings from land managers across the west, including Wyoming, where rangers complained that too many campfires haven't been properly snuffed out.

Here is a news article: Giant Camera Will Hunt For Signs Of Dark Energy toggle caption Reidar Hahn/Fermilab A giant and powerful digital camera is about to be shipped from a lab near Chicago to a telescope in Chile to study a mysterious part of the universe called dark energy. Dark energy makes up most of our universe, but scientists currently know almost nothing about it except that it seems to be making the expansion of our universe speed up. Enlarge this image toggle caption Cindy Arnold/Fermilab Cindy Arnold/Fermilab \\"There's enough data that people know what we don't understand, but there's not enough data to explain it yet,\\" says Brenna Flaugher, a physicist at Fermilab near Chicago, which assembled the Dark Energy Camera. \\"There's too much room for the theorists to come up with crazy ideas right now. And so there's lots of crazy ideas. And we need data.\\" That's where this new 570-megapixel camera comes in. Flaugher says its basic technology would be familiar to anyone who uses a digital point-and-shoot. \\"The camera that we built is really very similar to the digital cameras you can buy at Walmart or wherever,\\" she says. But this camera is big — its guts fill a shiny cylinder that's about the size of a car engine. \\"This thing weighs almost a ton,\\" says Flaugher. And the lenses are huge and heavy, too — with the largest lens about 3 feet across. This camera is also incredibly sensitive. After it's mounted on the Blanco 4-meter telescope, high in the Chilean mountains, later this year, the camera will survey a large part of the sky for faint galaxies at the distant reaches of our universe. By studying these galaxies, scientists hope to learn more about dark energy. \\"I think this probably is the first camera that's been designed just to do dark energy,\\" says Flaugher. Understanding Dark Energy There's enough data that people know what we don't understand, but there's not enough data to explain it yet. Dark energy was discovered only recently. In 1998, two different research teams saw the first evidence for it as they looked at the light coming to Earth from exploding stars in faraway galaxies. \\"What we were really measuring was how far away the galaxies were, and they were much farther away than they should be, just based on gravitation,\\" says Nicholas Suntzeff, an astronomer at Texas A&M; University. This meant something was acting against gravity. It's as if you threw a rock up in the air and instead of slowing down and coming back, the rock kept shooting up faster and faster, says Suntzeff. \\"You'd think that would be really weird,\\" he says. \\"That's antigravity. Well, the same thing happened with the galaxies.\\" As galaxies move apart from each other, they are speeding up, going faster and faster instead of slowing down. Suntzeff says it seems as though space itself has a natural ability to push away all other space around it. \\"That's what the equations are saying, that every piece of space, it's like it doesn't like anything else around it,\\" he explains. \\"It's constantly pushing everything away.\\" As it does that, new space is created in between, Suntzeff says, \\"but that new space that's created will see the other pieces of space and then push on that, which makes it a process which goes faster and faster and faster.\\" 'A Disturbing Idea' This means the universe is not only expanding — that expansion is speeding up. Suntzeff says it seems that the universe is flying apart, and galaxies will ultimately disappear in the sky — everything will go cold and dark. \\"That's a disturbing idea, both philosophically and theologically,\\" Suntzeff says, noting that the world's religions hold that things either renovate themselves or go to some place with eternal life. It's a challenging idea for science, too. Suntzeff recently served on an expert task force established to advise the government on future needs for dark energy research. It concluded that so far, science hasn't come up with any good explanations for why dark energy exists, and it recommended \\"an ambitious observational program to determine the dark energy properties as well as possible.\\" Enlarge this image toggle caption Reidar Hahn/Fermilab Reidar Hahn/Fermilab No one can photograph dark energy itself. But Flaugher says the new camera will look for the effects of dark energy by gathering data on more than 300 million galaxies whose faint light has been traveling toward Earth for a very long time. \\"With this camera we'll be able to go back about 6, 7 billion years, so about three-quarters to half-way back to the Big Bang,\\" she says. This will let researchers look back at how the universe has been expanding in the past, and see how dark energy may shape the universe's future. ||||| Home Page Why is the universe speeding up? In 1998, two teams of astronomers studying distant supernovae made the remarkable discovery that the expansion of the universe is speeding up. Yet, according to Einstein's theory of General Relativity, gravity should lead to a slowing of the expansion. To explain cosmic acceleration, cosmologists are faced with two possibilities: Either 75% of the universe exists in an exotic form, now called dark energy, that exhibits a gravitational force opposite to the attractive gravity of ordinary matter, or General Relativity must be replaced by a new theory of gravity on cosmic scales. The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is designed to probe the origin of the accelerating universe and help uncover the nature of dark energy by measuring the 14-billion-year history of cosmic expansion with high precision. More than 120 scientists from 23 institutions in the United States, Spain, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and Germany are working on the project. This collaboration has built and deployed an extremely sensitive 570-Megapixel digital camera, DECam. This new camera has been mounted on the Blanco 4-meter telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, high in the Chilean Andes. Starting in August of 2013 and continuing for five years, DES has begun to survey a large swath of the southern sky out to vast distances in order to provide new clues to this most fundamental of questions. New Results from DES! DES searches for optical signatures of gravitational waves Area covered by the DECam searches for optical counterparts of the first gravitational wave event GW150914. Results of our analyses can be found in Soares-Santos et. al 2016 and Annis et. al 2016. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A massive digital camera is set to be installed on the Blanco 4-meter telescope in the Chilean mountains to study dark energy, the phenomenon responsible for the accelerating expansion of our universe. The new 570-megapixel camera, an extremely sensitive device assembled at Fermilab near Chicago, is capable of capturing faint galaxies present at the most distant regions of our universe. The camera will gather data from over 300 million galaxies, enabling scientists to study how the universe has expanded in the past and predict how dark energy might shape its future. Dark energy comprises the majority of our universe, yet it remains one of the least understood phenomena in modern science, prompting the need for further data and research on this mysterious force."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Due to economic sanctions and trade embargoes, Cuban citizens primarily use cars designed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These cars contain engines that were designed before the introduction of the catalytic converter. Meanwhile trade relations between nearby Panama and Japan have enabled the citizens of Panama to drive cars with the most up to date catalytic converter technology possible. Which country's cars, Cuba's or Panama's, will emit more nitrogen oxides? Hint: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. Answer:","completion":"Cuba's cars will emit more nitrogen oxides. Steps to Arrive at Answer: 1. Step 1: Understand the context: The original question states that Cuban cars do not have catalytic converters since they are using cars designed in the late 1940s and early 1950s, prior to the invention of catalytic converters. 2. Step 2: Understanding catalytic converter: From the hint given, it explains that a catalytic converter is a device in the exhaust system of a car that provides a place for harmful materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. This includes nitrogen oxides which are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures in a car engine. 3. Step 3: Understand Panama's context: The question mentions that citizens of Panama drive cars with the most updated catalytic converter technology possible. This suggests that their cars are equipped with devices that minimize the emission of nitrogen oxides. 4. Step 4: Draw conclusion: From the information given, it could be said that since Cuba's cars do not have catalytic converters, they will emit more nitrogen oxides than Panama's cars. 5. Hence, the answer is Cuba."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Question: \\"Who beat Xiang Yu, Qin Shi Huangdi or Liu Bang?\\" Context: \\"China's first imperial dynasty was the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC). The Qin unified the Chinese Warring States by conquest, but their empire became unstable after the death of the first emperor Qin Shi Huangdi. Within four years, the dynasty's authority had collapsed in the face of rebellion. Two former rebel leaders, Xiang Yu (d. 202 BC) of Chu and Liu Bang (d. 195 BC) of Han, engaged in a war to decide who would become hegemon of China, which had fissured into 18 kingdoms, each claiming allegiance to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang. Although Xiang Yu proved to be a capable commander, Liu Bang defeated him at Battle of Gaixia (202 BC), in modern-day Anhui. Liu Bang assumed the title \\"emperor\\" (huangdi) at the urging of his followers and is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu (r. 202–195 BC). Chang'an was chosen as the new capital of the reunified empire under Han.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the historical context provided, it was Liu Bang who defeated Xiang Yu, not Qin Shi Huangdi. The conflict between Xiang Yu and Liu Bang occurred after the fall of the Qin dynasty, which was established by Qin Shi Huangdi. This period of Chinese history was marked by a power struggle to determine the subsequent ruling dynasty that would succeed the Qin. Following the death of Qin Shi Huangdi, the first emperor of the Qin dynasty, instability and rebellions took over the empire, leading to its eventual collapse. Numerous kingdoms arose in the aftermath, with various leaders proclaiming their loyalty to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang. Both men were former rebel forces against the Qin dynasty, and they battled for supremacy in China during this chaotic time. Xiang Yu was a skilled and talented commander, leading his kingdom of Chu and establishing substantial influence in the divided China. However, his opponent Liu Bang proved to be formidable and strategically astute in his own right. The two engaged in an epic confrontation that would determine the future of China, culminating in the Battle of Gaixia in 202 BC. At the Battle of Gaixia, which took place in modern-day Anhui, Liu Bang's forces managed to defeat Xiang Yu's armies. This crucial victory positioned Liu Bang as the leading figure in China, and his followers urged him to assume the title of \\"emperor\\" or \\"huangdi.\\" Liu Bang relented and took on the mantle, becoming known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu. Subsequently, he established the Han dynasty, marking a new chapter in Chinese history. Emperor Gaozu then selected Chang'an as the capital of the newly unified China under the Han dynasty. The Han dynasty, which followed the short-lived Qin dynasty, would go on to rule for over 400 years, playing a significant role in shaping Chinese culture, politics, and society. In summary, it was Liu Bang who defeated Xiang Yu in the battle for control over China after the collapse of the Qin dynasty, which was established by Qin Shi Huangdi. Liu Bang's triumph ushered in the Han dynasty and marked the beginning of a new era in Chinese history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine if the hypothesis \\"Personal Saving and Retirement Saving is not addressed in the material\\" is conclusively true given the premise provided, it is necessary to closely examine the information given in the premise. The premise contains the following points: 1. Personal Saving and Retirement Security 2. National Saving Overview 3. National Saving and the Economy 4. National Saving and the Government Let's analyze each point in the context of the hypothesis. 1. Personal Saving and Retirement Security: This point explicitly mentions personal saving and retirement. It can be inferred that the material does address this topic, potentially discussing the relationship between personal saving and retirement security. Hence, this point does not support the hypothesis. 2. National Saving Overview: This point gives an overview of national saving, which is a broader concept that includes personal saving, business saving, and government saving. Although personal saving is a part of national saving, it is unclear if the material specifically addresses the relationship between personal saving and retirement saving. Therefore, this point neither refutes nor supports the hypothesis. 3. National Saving and the Economy: This point discusses the relationship between national saving and the economy but does not explicitly state if there is any inclusion of personal saving and retirement saving. It can be inferred that this point likely focuses on macroeconomic perspectives, but it is possible that the material could touch upon personal saving within the broader context. It can be concluded that this point does not provide enough information to confirm or refute the hypothesis. 4. National Saving and the Government: This point focuses on the government aspect of national saving and does not mention personal saving or retirement saving specifically. Therefore, it does not provide any substantial evidence to support or refute the hypothesis. Upon analyzing the premise provided, it is evident that personal saving and retirement security are mentioned in the material. It is inconclusive if the exact relationship between personal saving and retirement saving is addressed or not. In conclusion, given the premise, it cannot be definitively said that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true. There is evidence suggesting that personal saving and retirement security are mentioned in the material. However, the exact way in which these topics are discussed or interrelated is not clear, so it is not possible to confirm or refute the hypothesis with certainty based on the premise alone."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: - Put the aluminum can into a recycle bin - The cans are transported to a facility - The cans are shredded by a machine - The cans are heated to 1400 degrees to melt them - The molten metal is poured into molds What might be the last step of the process?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Unless you are using a computer or graphing calculator, many systems of equations can only be approximately solved using this method. Your teacher or math textbook may require you to use this method so you are familiar with graphing equations as lines. You can also use this method to double-check your answers from one of the other methods. The basic idea is to graph both equations, and find the point where they intersect. The x and y values at this point will give us the value of x and the value of y in the system of equations. Keeping the two equations separate, use algebra to turn each equation into the form \\"y = __x + __\\". For example: Your first equation is 2x + y = 5. Change this to y = -2x + 5. Your second equation is -3x + 6y = 0. Change this to 6y = 3x + 0, then simplify to y = ½x + 0. If both equations are identical, the entire line will be an \\"intersection\\". Write infinite solutions. On a piece of graph paper, draw a vertical \\"y axis\\" and a horizontal \\"x axis.\\" Starting at the point where they intersect, label the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. moving up on the y-axis, and again going right on the x-axis. Label the numbers -1, -2, etc. moving down on the y-axis and left on the x-axis. If you don't have graph paper, use a ruler to make sure the numbers are spaced precisely apart. If you are using large numbers or decimals, you may need to scale your graph differently. (For example, 10, 20, 30 or 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 instead of 1, 2, 3). Once you have an equation in the form y = __x + __, you can start graphing it by drawing a dot where the line intercepts the y-axis. This is always going to be at a y-value equal to the last number in this equation. In our examples from earlier, one line (y = -2x + 5) intercepts the y-axis at 5. The other (y = ½x + 0) intercepts at 0. (These are points (0,5) and (0,0) on the graph.) Use different colored pens or pencils if possible for the two lines. In the form y = __x + __, the number in front of the x is the slope of the line. Each time x increases by one, the y-value will increase by the amount of the slope. Use this information to plot the point on the graph for each line when x = 1. (Alternatively, plug in x = 1 for each equation and solve for y.) In our example, the line y = -2x + 5 has a slope of -2. At x = 1, the line moves down 2 from the point at x = 0. Draw the line segment between (0,5) and (1,3). The line y = ½x + 0 has a slope of ½. At x = 1, the line moves up ½ from the point at x=0. Draw the line segment between (0,0) and (1,½). If the lines have the same slope, the lines will never intersect, so there is no answer to the system of equations. Write no solution. Stop and look at your graph. If the lines have already crossed, skip ahead to the next step. Otherwise, make a decision based on what the lines are doing: If the lines are moving toward each other, keep plotting points in that direction. If the lines are moving away from each other, move back and plot points in the other direction, starting at x = -1. If the lines are nowhere near each other, try jumping ahead and plotting more distant points, such as at x = 10. Once the two lines intersect, the x and y values at that point are the answer to your problem. If you're lucky, the answer will be a whole number. For instance, in our examples, the two lines intersect at (2,1) so your answer is x = 2 and y = 1. In some systems of equations, the lines will intersect at a value between two whole numbers, and unless your graph is extremely precise it will be difficult to tell where this is. If this happens, you can write an answer such as \\"x is between 1 and 2\\", or use the substitution or elimination method to find the precise answer. Summary:","completion":"To solve a system of equations using graphing, follow these steps: 1. Rewrite both equations in the form of \\"y = __x + __\\". 2. Set up a coordinate plane with an x-axis and a y-axis, and label the numbers on both axes. 3. Plot the y-intercept of each equation (where x = 0). 4. Determine the slope of each equation and use it to plot more points on the graph. 5. Continue plotting points, adjusting your direction if necessary, until the two lines intersect. 6. Once the lines intersect, find the x and y values at the point of intersection; these are the solutions to the system of equations. If the lines have the same slope and do not intersect, there is no solution. If the lines are identical, there are infinite solutions. If the lines intersect at a point between whole numbers, you may need to use another method to find the exact solution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You never really mean that you will stop playing with your friend forever. Adult countries also have this kind of situation; they sometimes say things they don't fully mean. North Korea is like a big kid that likes to say such things. North Korea once sent a fax to South Korea. You might wonder, \\"What is a fax?\\" Well, it's a very old way of sending messages. It's like sending a letter, but instead of using a post-office, you use a machine. Now, this fax that North Korea sent was not very friendly. They said they would \\"strike mercilessly without notice,\\" which is a very serious and scary thing to say. It's like if your friend yelled, \\"I will push you from the slide without telling you when!\\" Why did North Korea say such a thing? It happens after what North Korea thinks are \\"provocations.\\" Provocation is a fancy way of saying 'teasing' or 'bothering.' Just like when your friend teases you and you don't like it, North Korea also doesn't like it when they feel teased or bothered, and they react by saying scary things. Around the same time, there were some protests in Seoul. Seoul is the capital of South Korea, where a lot of people live. Protests are like when a lot of kids gather in the playground to say they don't like something. The people in Seoul were gathering because it was two years after Kim Jong Il, who was the leader of North Korea, had passed away. This is like remembering a school bully two years after he moved to a different school.

Derrick needed to stand on a stool to reach the top shelf.","completion":"Jason was quite short but Derrick was really tall. They got along well, despite the significant height difference between them. The two friends would often help each other out in various situations where their height would play a major role. In their shared apartment, the top shelf in one of the cabinets was home to some of their favorite snacks and books. Most of the time, it was Derrick who could easily access those items for both of them whenever they wanted. However, there were times when Jason would find himself needing to get something off the top shelf while Derrick wasn't around. In these situations, it was evident that Jason needed to stand on a stool to reach the top shelf. The stool, which was predominantly kept in the kitchen, served as a way to bridge the gap between Jason's height and the high shelves that were difficult – if not impossible – for him to reach. It didn't bother him much; he embraced the reality of his stature and the requirement to use some assistance every now and then. Besides, it provided him with a sense of independence and an opportunity to rely on himself whenever Derrick wasn't there to fetch items from the high shelves. Despite his height, Jason was quite agile and had excellent balance. He had learned from a young age how to maneuver on precarious heights without losing his footing. As a result, he could comfortably stand on the stool and grab things from the top shelf without any trouble or fear of falling. Derrick, on the other hand, didn't require any assistance when it came to reaching the top shelf. His lanky build and long arms made it easy for him to access those items. He would casually stretch and retrieve what he needed without putting in any extra effort. The height difference between them was a topic of their frequent light-hearted banters, but they both knew that their friendship went beyond any of the physical differences they possessed. In many other aspects of their lives, Jason and Derrick were fortunate to complement each other amazingly well. Where Jason struggled with high shelves, he excelled in navigating small and narrow spaces. Derrick often found his height disadvantageous when they entered small rooms or passage-ways and would jokingly grumble about knocking his head on low-hanging fixtures. Over the years, these two friends supported and helped each other in numerous ways. While it might seem that their contrasting heights would be a significant obstacle, they chose to see it as an opportunity to grow stronger as individuals and to appreciate the uniqueness that each brought to their friendship.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Milly's plan? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The number of animals is likely to increase under Milly's plan. By decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, Milly's plan aims to tackle the issue of global warming and climate change. This approach may help in preserving natural habitats that are being threatened by the effects of climate change, such as rising temperatures, increased frequency of extreme weather events, melting ice caps, and rising sea levels. By preserving these habitats and mitigating the impacts of climate change, Milly's plan would support the survival and growth of various animal species. This would, in turn, maintain biodiversity and contribute to the overall health of ecosystems. It's important to note, however, that the success of Milly's plan would depend on the effectiveness of the actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the collaboration of various stakeholders at local, regional, and global levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to Russian","completion":"Следовательно, оптимальное решение не должно иметь лучшего значения критерия TradeStation. Таким образом, оптимальное решение не обязательно должно иметь наилучшее значение критерия TradeStation. Это означает, что при поиске оптимального решения важно учитывать множество различных критериев и факторов, которые могут повлиять на успешность и эффективность торговой системы. Оптимальное решение должно демонстрировать превосходные результаты не только с точки зрения TradeStation, но и с учетом других значимых параметров, таких как стабильность прибыли, уровень риска, адекватность используемых торговых стратегий и индикаторов, а также надежность работы всей системы в целом. В процессе поиска такого решения трейдеры должны стремиться находить компромисс между различными показателями, которые могут находиться в противоречии друг с другом. Например, добиваясь более высокого значения критерия TradeStation, часто приходится жертвовать некоторой стабильностью прибыли или уровнем риска. Обратная ситуация тоже может иметь место, когда увеличение стабильности и надежности системы может привести к снижению показателей прибыльности и роста. Необходимость найти компромисс между разными критериями обусловлена тем, что оптимальное решение должно быть адаптивным и способным работать в разнообразных и меняющихся рыночных условиях. В этом контексте, идеальное решение является не тем, что имеет абсолютный максимум по одному критерию, но тем, что обеспечивает оптимальный баланс между всеми релевантными параметрами и способствует стабильному и постоянному росту вашего торгового капитала при разумном уровне риска. Выводы: Таким образом, оптимальное решение не должно стремиться к максимизации лишь одного показателя, такого как критерий TradeStation, а должно учитывать многообразие параметров и стремиться к достижению наилучшего баланса между ними. Только такое решение сможет обеспечить высокую стабильность и успешность торговой системы в долгосрочной перспективе."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by -58: j = 2030 / -58 Dividing we get: j ≈ -34.9827586207 Approximately, j ≈ -34.98.

Let's break down the sentiment of each part of the tweet: 1. \\"Thought I lost my promise ring.\\": This statement implies initial worry and concern about losing a valuable and emotionally significant item - the promise ring. The sentiment is negative as the person felt that they lost something important to them. 2. \\"Cried a bunch at work.\\": This sentence demonstrates a strong emotional response to the situation. The person was distraught, to the point of shedding tears at their workplace, which represents a negative sentiment as well. 3. \\"I never take it off ever.\\": This statement highlights the importance and attachment the person has towards the promise ring. It seems that they feel a deep sense of responsibility and commitment to wearing the ring, and as a result, it's extremely distressing if they think they've lost it. While the sentiment here is not inherently negative, the distress associated with the possibility of losing it creates a negative sentiment. 4. \\"My sister found it in my bed.\\": This sentence introduces a turning point in the tweet, where the person's sister finds the lost promise ring. The sentiment here turns positive, as they now know that the ring was not lost, and the distress of losing it has subsided. There is also an undertone of gratitude towards the sister for finding the valuable item. 5. \\"Feel weird without it.\\": This statement reinforces how significant the promise ring is to the person and how much they value it. This sentiment indicates that the person feels out of their comfort zone or awkward without the ring. In this context, the sentiment is neutral, further emphasizing the importance of the ring to the person. In conclusion, the tweet's sentiment is primarily negative at first, shifting to relief and gratitude, with a touch of neutral sentiment. Overall, it demonstrates a range of human emotions, which underscores the importance of personal items, such as promise rings, in building and maintaining emotional bonds among individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An excellent sportsman practices until he can play quickly, correctly and without thinking. Educators call it \\"automaticity \\". www.ks5u.com A child learns to read by sounding out the letters and finding the meaning of the words. With practice, he stumbles less and less, reading by the phrase . With automaticity, he doesn't have to think about the meaning of words, so he can give all his attention to the meaning of the text. It can begin as early as first grade. In a recent study of children in Illinois schools, Alan Rossman of Northwestern University found that automatic readers in the first grade not only read almost three times as fast as the others, but also got better results in exams. According to Rossman, the key to automaticity is the amount of time a child spends reading , not his IQ. Any child who spends at least 3.5 to 4 hours a week reading books, magazines or newspapers will probably reach automaticity. It can happen if a child turns off TV just one night for reading at home. You can test yourself by reading something new which is suitable for your level. If you read aloud with expression, with a sense of the meaning of the sentences, you probably are an automatic reader. If you read brokenly, one word at a time, without expression or meaning, you need more practice.

Tessibel Skinner is a young woman in a squatter village on the coast, where she lives with her father, a local fisherman. Towering above the village is the estate of Elias Graves, a wealthy man who hopes to use his influence to remove these squatters from his land. When his lawyer is unable to so directly, he instead enacts a ban on net fishing, removing the livelihoods of many people in the village, including Tess and her father. Despite the ban, some continue to fish illegally, though they are soon confronted by men sent by Graves. In this confrontation, one of Graves' men is shot and killed. Tess' father is wrongfully accused of the murder and arrested. Meanwhile, through these altercations Tess meets Frederick Graves, Elias' son, who is home on a break from his theological studies. Before long, the two begin a forbidden romance. Also on break with Frederick is Dan Jordan, a friend from his fraternity, who simultaneously falls in love with Frederick's sister, Teola. Soon after Dan and Frederick return to college, Teola learns that she is pregnant and struggles to decide if she should tell Dan. Her decision is made for her soon enough, as she receives a letter informing her that Dan has died heroically in a fire at the fraternity. Unable to confide in her very stern father, Teola is distraught and turns to Tess for support.

What is the missing first step of the following process: - The sound waves hit an object - Echoes are produced - The echo returns to the bat&#x27;s ears - The bat hears the echo - The bat can figure out where the object is located. A:","completion":"The missing first step in this process is: A bat emits a series of high-frequency calls or vocalizations through its mouth or nose. To elaborate, this process describes echolocation, a biological sonar system used by bats (as well as some other animals like dolphins and whales) to navigate, hunt, and avoid obstacles. The entire process can be explained in detail as follows: 1. A bat emits a series of high-frequency calls or vocalizations through its mouth or nose: Depending on the species, bats produce these calls at frequencies above the range of human hearing, typically between 20 kHz and 200 kHz. These vocalizations are created by the larynx or nasal passage and are often pulse-like or modulated in frequency. 2. The sound waves hit an object: As the high-frequency sound waves travel through the air, they encounter various objects such as insects, plants, and other obstacles. When the sound waves hit these objects, they bounce back toward the bat as echoes. 3. Echoes are produced: The reflected sound waves, or echoes, carry information about the objects they have encountered. This information includes the size, shape, texture, and even the direction and speed of a moving object like an insect. 4. The echo returns to the bat's ears: Specialized anatomy in the bat's head and ears allows it to capture the returning echoes. Bats have large, sensitive ears and structures known as tragi, which help to focus the sounds and differentiate between outgoing calls and incoming echoes. Some bats also have unique features called noseleaves, which can help direct their calls and receive echoes. 5. The bat hears the echo: As the bat processes the incoming echoes, its brain begins to build a mental map, or acoustic image, of its surroundings. This allows the bat to perceive the distance, size, shape, and location of objects in its environment. 6. The bat can figure out where the object is located: By comparing the time it takes for an echo to return and the difference in intensity between the two ears, the bat can identify the distance and direction of the object. This information allows the bat to navigate, avoid obstacles, and capture food successfully. Echolocation is a vital skill for bats, as they are often active in low-light or completely dark environments where visual cues are limited. In conclusion, the missing first step is the bat emitting high-frequency calls or vocalizations, which initiates the echolocation process. This remarkable ability helps bats thrive in their unique ecological roles as nocturnal hunters and navigators."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The body of a 52-year-old woman who fell to her death in the Pyrenees was devoured by Griffon vultures before emergency services were able to retrieve it. Furious locals are demanding that authorities take action against the endangered carrion-eaters after they left only the woman's bones, clothes and shoes for burial. Fear of the birds has been growing in recent years, which have reportedly also begun attacking live animals since a European edict that dead livestock must not be left in the fields. Protected: A Griffon vulture in flight. The body of a 52-year-old woman who fell 1,000ft to her death in the Pyrenees was devoured by the carrion eaters before emergency services were able to retrieve it. Farmers want to be given the right to shoot the protected birds, which they say have started to prey on live sheep and cows. The campaign is gathering pace after the latest incident, in which a woman slipped and fell down a 1,000ft slope on the Pic de Pista after taking a short cut while walking with two friends. Major Didier Pericou of the gendarmerie told The Times that they believed the woman died in the fall, but added that there was little left of her by the time a search party found her body. 'When we first went out in the helicopter looking for the body, we saw numerous vultures without realising what they were doing,' he said. 'There were only bones, clothes and shoes left on the ground. 'They took 40 to 50 minutes to eat the body.' 'Conservation issue': An EC ruling that dead animals must be burned due to danger of BSE transmission has critically lowered the vultures' food supply. The incident is the latest in a series to cast the griffon vulture in a villanous light, which has prompted rural French and Spanish of the region to ask for the right to shoot the protected birds. For centuries, the Pyrenean farmers lived in symbiotic harmony with the griffon vulture. Wheeling over their flocks and fields, the birds were seen as neither a threat nor even a nuisance, but as a vital part of the ecosystem. When farmers had to dispose of a dead animal, they would simply take it to one of hundreds of carcass dumps scattered across the moutains where the scavengers gathered to do their work. But now, after an EC ruling that dead animals must be burned due to the danger of BSE transmission, the vultures' food supply has been critically lowered and they have been forced to spread further afield. Fear of vultures has been growing in recent years as they have spread from their mountain eyries. French. news weekly Le Nouvel Observateur, in 2007 reported of 'mutant. vultures', with one woman saying that a group of the birds, whose. wingspans can exceed seven feet, gathered menacingly near to where her. children were sitting. One. farmer, Alain Larralde, said he saw a group of vultures attack and start. eating an adult cow. There have been reports of live animals carried. off. 'You can't imagine what it is like to see an animal eaten alive,' Mr Larralde was reported to have said. But ornithologists say the real threat is not posed by the birds, but rather to them. Grahame. Madge, European bird of prey expert at the Royal Society for the. Protection of Birds, said: 'We are seeing three-figure vulture flocks. over Belgium and Holland. These birds are fanning out across Europe in. search of food. 'There is a conservation issue here.'

Before emergency services could get to her, Griffon vultures ate her body, leaving only her bones, clothes, and shoes. Local people are upset and want the authorities to take action against these endangered birds. The vultures have started to act differently because a rule says dead animals in fields must be removed, so they do not have enough food. This has caused the vultures to spread out and sometimes attack live animals. Farmers want the right to shoot these birds to protect their animals. However, bird experts say we should worry about protecting the vultures instead, because they are important to the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lawless was at the press conference, but declined to speak. \\"We are distressed at the possibility that such a tragedy might have happened in a place of worship,\\" the relative said Sunday, adding that the family asks the press and the community to \\"understand the church's desire to continue their worship and ministry outreach.\\" Watch neighbors remember slain girl ». The church \\"is a community of loving people,\\" he said. \\"They love God. They love their community and they have ministered to the people of this community for many, many years.\\" Huckaby's family expressed appreciation for the support and prayers received from other churches. Although it has been difficult, the church has \\"done everything that we can to be cooperative\\" with the investigation, the man said. The family thanked law enforcement for what the man said was \\"gracious treatment.\\" \\"Our prayers are with Sandra's family and the community for God's comfort and mercy as we work through the process of healing for such a tragic event,\\" the man said. \\"We trust in God's peace.\\" The church was planning to hold Easter services at noon Sunday, he said. \\"We're very shocked,\\" said a woman, who also identified herself only as a family member. \\"It's very out of character for Melissa. We love her dearly.\\" She described Huckaby as \\"a fantastic mother, very loving. ... This is a very difficult time for us and it's very difficult to express to you right now how we're feeling.\\" Huckaby's relatives know no more on the investigation than what has been reported by the media, the relatives said, and were not told why police were searching the church. \\"The only reason why our family is making it through this at all is because of our faith in God and because of his mercy,\\" the woman said. Asked whether she believes Huckaby is innocent, she declined comment. In a Friday interview with the Tracy Press newspaper, Huckaby acknowledged owning the black rolling suitcase in which Sandra's body was found, but said she reported it missing the day before the child's body was found. She said the suitcase disappeared at about the same time Sandra did. Sheneman told reporters Saturday that \\"inconsistencies\\" between that interview and statements Huckaby had made to police were one reason police asked to re-interview her Friday night. He would not say whether police believe Sandra's death was planned. Police said earlier Saturday that they believe Sandra was already dead by the time she was reported missing. The day Sandra was last seen, she came home from school, kissed her mother and left to play with a friend who lives nearby. A short time later, she left to go to another friend's home, a family spokeswoman has said. Huckaby told the Tracy Press that Sandra came by her home to see if she could play with Huckaby's daughter, but Huckaby would not let her daughter play because she wanted her daughter to pick up her toys. Sandra left for another friend's house, Huckaby told the newspaper. The girl was last seen wearing a pink Hello Kitty T-shirt and black leggings. Police later used that clothing description to identify her body. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"The family of Melissa Huckaby, who was charged with kidnapping and murder in the death of 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, said the accusations against her are \\"completely out of character.\\" Huckaby, 28, lived in the same mobile home park as the victim and the children often played together. Sandra's body was found in a suitcase submerged in a pond at a dairy farm. The motive behind the killing is unclear, and Huckaby's family expressed their deep sadness at Sandra's loss and shock at the arrest. Melissa Huckaby is the granddaughter of Clifford Lane Lawless, pastor of Clover Road Baptist Church, and taught Sunday school at the church. The church was searched as part of the investigation into Sandra's disappearance and death, and the family thanked law enforcement for their \\"gracious treatment.\\" The investigation is ongoing, and the family has been relying on their faith in God to cope with this tragic event.

(Financial Times) -- The increasing amount of personal information that can been gleaned by computer programs that track how people use Facebook has been revealed by an extensive academic study. Such programmes can discern undisclosed private information such as Facebook users' sexuality, drug-use habits and even whether their parents separated when they were young, according to the study by Cambridge university academics. In one of the biggest studies of its kind, scientists from the university's psychometrics team and a Microsoft-funded research centre analysed data from 58,000 Facebook users to predict traits and other information that were not provided in their profiles. The algorithms were 88 per cent accurate in predicting male sexual orientation, 95 per cent for race and 80 per cent for religion and political leanings. Personality types and emotional stability were also predicted with accuracy ranging from 62-75 per cent. Facebook declined to comment. The study highlights growing concerns about social networks and how data trails can be mined for sensitive information, even when people attempt to keep information about themselves private. Less than 5 per cent of users predicted to be gay, for example, were connected with explicitly gay groups. Michal Kosinksi, one of the report's authors, told the Financial Times that the university's techniques could easily be replicated by companies to infer personal attributes a person did not wish to share, such as sexual orientation or political views: \\"We used very simple and generic methods. Marketing companies and internet companies could spend much more time and resources, and hence get much higher accuracy than we did.\\" Last week , the EU agreed to water down proposals for a radical overhaul of data privacy regulation. The move reflects governments' reluctance to impede internet businesses that might spur economic growth, and follows fierce lobbying from technology companies including Facebook and Google. Personal data has become big business. Wonga, the UK online lender, makes credit judgments within seconds based on thousands of pieces of information, including an applicant's Facebook profile. Tesco, the supermarket chain, this month started to use its customers' shopping histories to sell targeted online advertising. The report also revealed some unexpected correlations -- such as people who liked 'curly fries' having higher IQs, while those who like Facebook's \\"Sliding on Floors With Your Socks On\\" page were unlikely to use drugs. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Has declined\\" correctly answer the question \\"Has Facebook commented on the ability of computer programs that track how people use Facebook to discern undisclosed private information?\\"?","completion":"Yes, the response \\"Has declined\\" correctly answers the question \\"Has Facebook commented on the ability of computer programs that track how people use Facebook to discern undisclosed private information?\\" The paragraph mentions that \\"Facebook declined to comment.\\" This means Facebook has chosen not to provide a statement or response on this matter, so stating Facebook \\"has declined\\" is a valid statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: A plane carrying the body of Korean War POW Glenn Schoenmann arrived at Nashville International Airport in Tennessee on Thursday to be greeted by four emotional siblings, 62 years after their brother voluntarily left home to fight in the war. Private First Class Schoenmann died in a North Korean prison camp on December 29, 1950, at the age of 20. He was wounded and suffered days in the frigid cold alone during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, known to Korean War veterans as the ‘frozen Chosin.’ Not forgotten: Private First Class Glenn Schoenmann, who left his family farm in Tennessee to volunteer for the Korean War, is seen in this undated handout photo courtesy of the Tennessee Department of Veterans Affairs. Long-awaited service: Schoenmann's personal items were put on display during a funeral for the Korean War veteran who died in a prison camp at the age of 19. The battle took place in late November 1950 as severe winter weather hit North Korea and hundreds of thousands of Communist Chinese troops poured into the country to overturn what had been a largely successful American and United Nations advance. Injured and cut off from his unit, Schoenmann managed to avoid being captured for several days. But eventually, wounded and weakened from the cold, the young soldier was caught and detained in a North Korean prison camp, where he died. His remains were later recovered in 2004 during a brief period of cooperation between the U.S. and North Korea. Schoenmann’s corpse was identified by DNA taken from family members after a nephew’s online ancestry search came to the attention of U.S. authorities involved in recovering Korean War POW remains, the Leaf Chronicle in Tennessee reports. Closure: Sibling Raymond Schoenmann wipes his eyes during the funeral for his brother held at the Grundy County High School in Coalmont, Tennessee. Respects paid: Army Chaplin Ladislao Hernandez paid respects during the funeral for Korean War veteran Private First Class Schoenmann. Preparation for burial: The Army honor guard preparing to move Glenn Schoenmann's to the cemetery. His older brother says he remembers driving him to a bus station in Nashville more than 62 years ago. ‘He knew where he was going,’ Ernest Schoenmann, 86, of Creve Coure, Illinois, told the Chronicle. ‘He said, “I don’t think I’ll ever come home alive.\\" ‘That was hard. Those were the last words I can remember.’ Ernest Schoenmann, who was informed of the positive identification shortly before Thanksgiving, said his family learned a lot about what their sibling went through. ‘They gave me a booklet with an interview with one of the boys who was in prison with him,’ he said. ‘I started to read it, but I couldn’t. It was so horrible.’ Communal dedication: Locals lined the streets during the funeral procession. Proper ceremony: The honor guard carried Schoenmann's casket during the funeral in Palmer, Tennessee, on Saturday, January 12, 2013. Saying goodbye: Ernest, left, and Raymond, right, Schoenmann sat quietly during the funeral service for their brother who was 20 when he died in December 1950. As with thousands of other U.S. soldiers killed in action or by the harsh conditions of their captivity, Schoenmann’s remains were not returned to the U.S. after authorities signed an armistice with North Korea on July 27, 1953. Six decades after the signing of that armistice, over 8,000 U.S. military men and women remain unaccounted for. The Korean War, which was fought between June 25,1950, and July, 27, 1953, has often been referred to as 'The Forgotten War' and 'The Unknown War' due to the lack of public attention it received. Ernest Schoenmann said he wishes other families of missing Korean War service members will still be able to find closure as their loved ones remain half a world away. ‘I just wish more of them were home,’ he said. ‘There’s still so many of them missing over there.’Glenn Schoenmann’s long-awaited funeral was held in Tennessee on Saturday.

SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies.

Movie title: Clockstoppers Movie plot: The NSA-funded QT (Quantum Tech) Corporation has slated a project to develop Hypertime, a technology which allows the user's molecules to speed up to the point where the world appears to be standing still. After realizing that such technology, contained within a wristwatch frame, could also be used against the USA, the NSA orders the project stopped. However, the research is farther along than the NSA expected and QT's leader Henry Gates plans on using the technology to control the leader of the NSA and dominate the world. He uses the prototype to stretch the weekend in order to give the brilliant lead scientist Earl Dopler time to fix the remaining glitch in the technology after his henchmen Richard and Jay prevent Earl's incognito departure at the airport. However, the disadvantage of Earl being in Hypertime for too long was him aging rapidly in real time, as his molecular age continued at the same rate despite time slowing down. However, initially unknown to Gates, Dopler had sent a prototype to a former colleague of his named Dr. George Gibbs. His son Zak discovers the watch accidentally and initially uses it for fun, much to the amusement of Francesca, the new girl at school who just moved to the U.S. from Venezuela and on whom Zak has a crush. Once Gates finds out about the leaked prototype, he attempts to retrieve it. He sends his henchmen after Zak who break into his house and search for evidence. Upon learning about the ulterior motive of QT Corporation, Zak sets out to warn his father of the danger he could be in. A chase sequence ensues, with Zak crashing the car into the river and thus damaging the watch. He awakes in the hospital with a broken watch and only by a stroke of luck manages to avoid Jay and Richard again. He then goes in search of somewhere safe to hide in the meantime, after having been accused of stealing a van by the police.

The interconnected lines which facilitate this movement are known as a transmission network. This is distinct from the local wiring between high-voltage substations and customers, which is typically referred to as electric power distribution. The combined transmission and distribution network is known as the \\"power grid\\" in North America, or just \\"the grid\\". In the United Kingdom, the network is known as the \\"National Grid\\". - The coulomb (unit symbol: C) is the International System of Units (SI) unit of electric charge. It is the charge (symbol: \\"Q\\" or \\"q\\") transported by a constant current of one ampere in one second: - Voltage, electric potential difference, electric pressure or electric tension (formally denoted or , but more often simply as \\"V\\" or \\"U\\", for instance in the context of Ohm's or Kirchhoff's laws) is the difference in electric potential energy between two points per unit electric charge. The voltage between two points is equal to the work done per unit of charge against a static electric field to move the test charge between two points and is measured in units of \\"volts\\" (a joule per coulomb). - In physics, potential energy is energy possessed by a body by virtue of its position relative to others, stresses within itself, electric charge, and other factors. Common types include the gravitational potential energy of an object that depends on its mass and its distance from the center of mass of another object, the elastic potential energy of an extended spring, and the electric potential energy of an electric charge in an electric field. The unit for energy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule, which has the symbol \\"J\\". - Colorado is a state in the United States encompassing most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains.

The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,456,574 on July 1, 2015, an increase of 8.50% since the 2010 United States Census. - A high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) electric power transmission system (also called a power super highway or an electrical super highway) uses direct current for the bulk transmission of electrical power, in contrast with the more common alternating current (AC) systems. For long-distance transmission, HVDC systems may be less expensive and suffer lower electrical losses. For underwater power cables, HVDC avoids the heavy currents required to charge and discharge the cable capacitance each cycle. For shorter distances, the higher cost of DC conversion equipment compared to an AC system may still be justified, due to other benefits of direct current links. - Alternating current (AC), is an electric current which periodically reverses polarity, whereas direct current (DC, also dc) flows only in one direction with a single polarity either positive or negative. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electric energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations \\"AC\\" and \\"DC\\" are often used to mean simply \\"alternating\\" and \\"direct\\", as when they modify \\"current\\" or \\"voltage\\". - An electric potential (also called the \\"electric field potential\\" or the \\"electrostatic potential\\") is the amount of electric potential energy that a unitary point electric charge would have if located at any point in space, and is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from the arbitrarily chosen reference point (usually infinity) to that point without any acceleration. - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function. - The joule, symbol J, is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units. It is equal to the energy transferred to (or work done on) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre (1 newton metre or N·m). It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule (18181889). - An electric field is a vector field that associates to each point in space the Coulomb force that would be experienced per unit of electric charge, by an infinitesimal test charge at that point. Electric fields converge and diverge at electric charges and can be induced by time-varying magnetic fields. The electric field combines with the magnetic field to form the electromagnetic field. - Electric potential energy, or electrostatic potential energy, is a potential energy (measured in joules) that results from conservative Coulomb forces and is associated with the configuration of a particular set of point charges within a defined system. An \\"object\\" may have electric potential energy by virtue of two key elements: its own electric charge and its relative position to other electrically charged \\"objects\\". - Nebraska is a state that lies in both the Great Plains and the Midwestern United States. The state is bordered by South Dakota to the north, Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River, Kansas to the south, Colorado to the southwest and Wyoming to the west. Its area is just over 77,220 sq mi (200,000 km) with almost 1.9 million people. Its state capital is Lincoln. Its largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - The Great Plains is the broad expanse of flat land (a plain), much of it covered in prairie, steppe and grassland, that lies west of the Mississippi River tallgrass prairie states and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. This area covers parts, but not all, of the states of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming. - The volt (symbol: V) is the derived unit for electric potential, electric potential difference (voltage), and electromotive force. The volt is named in honour of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (17451827), who invented the voltaic pile, possibly the first chemical battery. - Electric power is the rate, per unit time, at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second. - Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. There are two types of electric charges: positive and negative. Like charges repel and unlike attract. An object is negatively charged if it has an excess of electrons, and is otherwise positively charged or uncharged. The SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C). In electrical engineering, it is also common to use the ampere-hour (Ah), and, in chemistry, it is common to use the elementary charge (\\"e\\") as a unit. The symbol \\"Q\\" often denotes charge. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, and is still accurate for problems that don't require consideration of quantum effects. - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. - Sidney is a city and county seat of Cheyenne County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 6,757 at the 2010 census. - An ion is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge. Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization. - The Missouri River is the longest river in North America. Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river takes drainage from a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than half a million square miles (1,300,000 km), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river system. - Pressure (symbol: \\"p\\" or \\"P\\") is the force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed. Gauge pressure (also spelled \\"gage\\" pressure) is the pressure relative to the ambient pressure. - Direct current (DC) is the unidirectional flow of electric charge. Direct current is produced by sources such as batteries, power supplies, thermocouples, solar cells, or dynamos. Direct current may flow in a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC). A term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current. - The Midwestern United States, also referred to as the American Midwest or simply the Midwest, is one of the four geographic regions defined by the United States Census Bureau, occupying the northern central part of the United States of America. It was officially named the North Central region by the Census Bureau until 1984. - The ohm (symbol: ) is the SI derived unit of electrical resistance, named after German physicist Georg Simon Ohm. Although several empirically derived standard units for expressing electrical resistance were developed in connection with early telegraphy practice, the British Association for the Advancement of Science proposed a unit derived from existing units of mass, length and time and of a convenient size for practical work as early as 1861. The definition of the ohm was revised several times. Today the definition of the ohm is expressed from the quantum Hall effect. - South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city. - Capacitance is the ability of a body to store an electric charge. There are two closely related notions of capacitance: \\"self capacitance\\" and \\"mutual capacitance\\", that are usually both designated by the same term \\"capacitance\\". A material with a large self capacitance holds more electric charge at a given voltage, than one with low capacitance. Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits self capacitance. The notion of mutual capacitance is particularly important for understanding the operations of the capacitor, one of the three fundamental electronic components (along with resistors and inductors). - Wyoming is a state in the mountain region of the western United States. The state is the tenth largest by area, the least populous and the second least densely populated state in the country. Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho. Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city in Wyoming, with a population estimate of 63,335 in 2015. The state population was estimated at 586,107 in 2015, which is less than the population of 31 of the largest U.S. cities. - Virginia Smith Converter Station is a High - voltage direct current ( HVDC ) back - to - back station near Sidney , Nebraska at 41 ° 09 51 \`\` N 102 ° 59 15 '' W named for former Congresswoman Virginia Smith , a Nebraska Republican who represented Nebraska 's 3rd congressional district from 1975 to 1991 . Virginia Smith Converter Station was built by Siemens and began service in 1988 . The station can transfer a maximum power of 200 megawatts ; the voltage used by the station is 55.5 kV . Timing differences in continental - sized nations make national power grids based solely on conventional alternating current impossible . However , power can be transferred over longer distances and between separate AC grids by conversion to direct current during transmission , and conversion to alternating current in phase with the local line frequency at the delivery point . By the early 21st century , high - power semiconductors began to make the more difficult DC - to - AC conversion technically and economically possible at the high power levels needed in power grids . The Virginia Smith Converter station is significant for being the first interchange between eastern and western United States electrical grids . - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - Nebraska's 3rd congressional district seat encompasses the western three-fourths of the state; it is one of the largest non-at-large Congressional districts in the country, covering nearly , two time zones and 68.5 counties. It includes Grand Island, Kearney, Hastings, North Platte, and Scottsbluff. What is the relationship between 'virginia smith converter station' and 'cheyenne county'? A:","completion":"The Virginia Smith Converter Station is located near Sidney, Nebraska, which is a city and the county seat of Cheyenne County.

Title: The Big Heat Movie plot: Homicide detective Sergeant Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford) is an honest cop who investigates the death of fellow officer Tom Duncan. It would seem to be an open-and-shut case, suicide brought on by depression, but Bannion is then contacted by the late cop's mistress, Lucy Chapman (Dorothy Green), who claims that it could not have been suicide.She explains that Duncan was in perfect health and had no reason to do it. All the evidence points to a self-inflicted gunshot wound and Bannion is prepared to believe that Chapman is just talking tales as a means of making a little money. But he is intrigued to learn that the Duncans had a second home which would simply not have been possible on his salary.Bannion visits Mrs Duncan (Jeanette Nolan) and raises the subject but she resents the implication of his suspicions. The next day Bannion gets a dressing-down by Lieutenant Ted Wilks (Willis Bouchey) who is under pressure from \\"upstairs\\" to close the case with as little grief to the widow as possible.Chapman is later found dead after being tortured and covered with cigarette burns. After counting \\"every single one of them\\" Bannion sets about investigating her murder even though it is not his case or his jurisdiction.

A British TV celebrity has been accused of sexually abusing a woman. An alleged victim has come forward after the ITV. documentary that claimed Jimmy Savile molested underage girls to tell producers that she was abused by a. well-known media figure when she was a child. The new allegations concern a TV personality who is still alive, but he has not been named. The woman made the new claims first to the makers of the 'Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile' documentary, who have advised her to contact the police. A member of the ITV production team claimed: 'We have had a name given to us which is so far not in the public domain. 'It relates to a celebrity, a media. personality, who is alive.

The latest claims come after the slew of accusations against Savile, who died aged 84 in October last year. The former Top of the Pops star is alleged to have molested underage girls and assaulted sick children in their hospital beds. New claims allege that Savile groped children at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, Leeds General Infirmary and at Broadmoor. A former Broadmoor patient Alison Pink, claimed Savile groped her while she watched TV. A former nurse at the Leeds hospital where Savile worked as a porter, said he molested a brain-damaged hospital patient. Jimmy Savile is accused of preying on patients at Stoke Mandeville hospital which he raised money for. Regular: Jimmy Savile pictured at Stoke Mandeville hospital, Buckinghamshire, in 2003. June Thornton said she was recovering from an operation at Leeds General Infirmary when she saw Savile abuse the young girl. 'She had brain damage, and Jimmy Savile came in and kissed her,' she said. 'He started kissing her neck, running his hands up and down her arms, and then started to molest her. 'Because I was laid flat on my back, there was nothing I could do.' Leeds General Infirmary said it had received two complaints after the allegations against Savile became public almost two weeks ago. Nurses at Stoke Mandeville hospital in Buckinghamshire are understood to have dreaded Savile’s visits because of his behaviour, and would tell children to stay in bed and pretend to be asleep when he arrived. Stoke Mandeville – a spinal injuries specialist centre in aid of which Savile frequently ran marathons – insisted it had ‘no record’ of complaints about him.

Use the following highlights to write an article: A new study has found a surge of testosterone released into newborn baby boys' brains. Named Hersheys Kiss, the protein is not evident in the female brain. This discovery could play a role in understanding neurological diseases men and women suffer from.","completion":"Title: Testosterone Surge in Newborn Baby Boys' Brains May Shed Light on Gender-Based Neurological Differences Introduction A groundbreaking new study has identified a previously unknown phenomenon involving a surge of testosterone released into the brains of newborn baby boys. This remarkable discovery could be pivotal not only in expanding our understanding of early gender-related neurological development, but also in revealing insights into neurological disorders that disproportionately affect men and women. The \\"Hersheys Kiss\\" Protein Scientists have named the protein responsible for this testosterone surge \\"Hersheys Kiss,\\" owing to its similarity to the iconic chocolate's shape. While its complete function remains unclear, researchers believe that it could contribute directly to the differentiation between male and female brains. They were careful to note that Hersheys Kiss is not found in the female brain. For now, the discovery of this protein has opened a world of possibilities in better comprehending the complexities of the human brain. Gender-Based Neurological Diseases The implications of this breakthrough could be far-reaching, particularly with regard to understanding and potentially treating neurological diseases that men and women experience differently. Several neurological disorders have been shown to disproportionately impact one gender over the other. For example, studies have demonstrated that males are more prone to developing autism, ADHD, and dyslexia, while women are more likely to suffer from Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The newfound understanding of the Hersheys Kiss protein could assist researchers in identifying why such distinctions exist and how they might be mitigated therapeutically. By exploring the role of this protein in the male brain, scientists hope to decipher its potential involvement in neurological health and pathologies, ultimately leading to a better understanding of neurological differences in both sexes. Future Directions for Research While there is much that remains to be discovered about the intricacies of the Hersheys Kiss protein, this pioneering study has laid the groundwork for further inquiry. To more thoroughly examine the protein's impact and function in the male brain, researchers will need to identify the specific processes by which it affects neurological development. Additionally, future studies could extend the investigation to encompass the female brain, focusing on understanding whether a different protein or hormone may have a comparable effect on its development. There is also significant potential for collaboration with researchers in other disciplines, such as psychiatry, to explore potential links between the Hersheys Kiss protein and gender-related mental health disparities, leading to more individualized treatments for a variety of conditions. Conclusion The discovery of the Hersheys Kiss protein and its role in the male brain offers a fresh perspective on the complex and nuanced interactions between hormones and brain development. As research progresses and our understanding of the protein's function continues to grow, we can expect to see new insights that could contribute to the development of targeted treatments for neurological diseases. Ultimately, this could result in a more comprehensive understanding of the gender-based differences in the human brain and may help pave the way for improving the quality of life for individuals suffering from neurological conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Also, don't pick a spot that gets extreme temperatures. A sunny room is a good choice, but set the plant out from the window 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) so that it gets indirect light. Leave the plant in this spot to help it adjust. Resist the temptation to move the plant around or to transplant it into a new pot.

After being moved around among several different environments, the plant is in a state of semi-shock and needs time to adjust to yet another environment. Isolate new plants from other plants in the house to prevent the spread of diseases and pests. Avoid placing a warmth-loving species in the greenhouse or warm room right away, even if it loves the situation. Many florists and garden centers keep plants in lower temperatures, and if you make the plant too warm at first, it can lead to shock. The plant has probably been fertilized at some point.

The second sentence focuses specifically on the elimination of the Private Express Statutes: \\"The private express statutes would need to be eliminated to create a competitive environment.\\" Although this sentence only mentions the Private Express Statutes and not the mailbox rule, it is still entailed by the first sentence because it aligns with the idea of eliminating the Private Express Statutes as one of the minimum requirements for a competitive environment. The second sentence reinforces and reiterates the need to eliminate the Private Express Statutes to achieve the goal mentioned in the first sentence. In summary, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence because it matches the notion of eliminating the Private Express Statutes as a crucial step toward creating a competitive environment. However, it is essential to recognize that the first sentence also mentions the need to eliminate the mailbox rule, which the second sentence does not address."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Elmer changes his tune to one of uncharacteristic niceness and sets Bugs free. Bugs, with characteristic élan, takes full advantage of the situation by sneaking into Elmer's house before Elmer returned and making himself at home. As Elmer returns, he hears Bugs singing \\"Angel in Disguise\\", while taking a shower and later shaving; Bugs uses the opportunity to purposely aggravate Elmer, knowing that he has Uncle Louie as blackmail and because of this Elmer cannot effectively punish Bugs in any way at the risk of losing his inheritance.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Intramembranous ossification begins in utero during fetal development and continues on into adolescence. At birth, the skull and clavicles are not fully ossified nor are the sutures of the skull closed. This allows the skull and shoulders to deform during passage through the birth canal. The last bones to ossify via intramembranous ossification are the flat bones of the face, which reach their adult size at the end of the adolescent growth spurt. Q: What process that begins in utero during fetal development and continues on into adolescence involves closing of the skull? A: Answer:","completion":"The process that begins in utero during fetal development and continues on into adolescence, involving the closing of the skull, is known as intramembranous ossification. Intramembranous ossification is a critical process in the development of the flat bones of the skull, as well as the clavicles. During this process, mesenchymal cells, which are embryonic connective tissue cells, differentiate into specialized bone-forming cells called osteoblasts. These osteoblasts then secrete an organic matrix called osteoid, which is composed of collagen and other proteins. The process of mineralization occurs when calcium phosphate crystals are deposited in the osteoid, ultimately forming the hard structure of the bone. The bones formed through intramembranous ossification are critical for providing protection to vital organs such as the brain, as well as support for the body's overall structure. At birth, the bones of the skull and clavicles are not fully ossified, and the sutures of the skull, which are fibrous joints connecting the bones, remain open. This is advantageous for a newborn because it allows for the deformation of the skull and shoulders as the infant passes through the birth canal. As the child grows and develops, the process of intramembranous ossification continues, leading to the gradual closing of the skull sutures and increased rigidity of the skull bones. The final bones to ossify via intramembranous ossification are the flat bones of the face. These bones typically reach their adult size at the end of adolescent growth spurts. Throughout the entire process of intramembranous ossification, the skull and other related bones are progressively strengthened and remodeled, ultimately providing essential support, stability, and protection for the body's vital structures and functions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pre-treatment of HL-60 cells with an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), which activated canonical Wnt signaling, partly abolished the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by 6-BT. Pre-treatment of HL-60 cells with an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), resulting in inactivation of non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ signaling, abolished 6-BT-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Pogs are cardboard discs about the size of a US half-dollar. They're usually blank on one side, with some kind of design on the other side. Slammers are metal discs that are somewhat larger than the pogs themselves. They were typically sold in big bins throughout the 90s, and can still be found in some kids stores, attics, and thrift shops. The original pogs were the cardboard caps from bottles of POG, a popular juice in Hawaii. The game was played using bottle caps for a long time before it was commercialized for the mainland, where it became very popular in the 1990s. If you want to make some pogs, trace a circle onto a piece of paper 4 centimeter (1.6 in) in diameter. Tape it onto a slab of cardboard. Cut the circle out and draw a design on the top using with black pen. Color if you want. To make the slammer, simply tape two pieces of cardboard together and flatten it. Pogs is mostly a game of collecting the biggest and coolest collection of discs. A game of pogs requires a big pot of pogs, so it's usually played between a few friends all of whom have a big stack of them. The object of the game is to end up with your buddy's pogs in your stack, to make your collection grow. Most games start with everyone comparing their favorite pogs in a pile. If you see some that you like, you can offer to trade for them or play for them. Once you see some pogs that you like, you can challenge your buddy to a game to keep them, but only if you both agree. If you don't want to play for keeps, make sure you both know it. Before the game, the players decide whether to play for \\"keeps\\" or \\"no-keeps\\". If you play for \\"keeps\\", a player keeps the pogs that are won, even if they are his opponents. Back in the 90s, when playing with pogs was really popular, lots of schools outlawed the game. Teachers claimed that playing with pogs was a form of gambling. While its not super-common anymore, it's still good to make sure that it's allowed with your parents or teachers before you play. Any hard flat surface will be fine to play pogs. Carpet, counter tops, and concrete are all good places for pogs. Just make sure you don't dent up your mom's table with your slammer. If you play on the concrete, sometimes it's good to put all the pogs on a book, or on a binder to keep your slammer from getting all dinged up. Go around the circle, and takes turns putting in the pogs that you're going to play with. Just make a big pile of them facedown. Each player must put in the same number of pogs. It's usually best to play with at least 10-15 pogs total. Make sure the stack is at least that big. Start by placing all the pogs into a pile, then shuffling them and stacking them face down. This helps to ensure that someone's pogs aren't all at the bottom. If you're playing for keeps, remember that any pogs you put into the stack might not come back to you when you're done. You have to decide which pogs you're willing to risk to get the ones that you want. Once you've shuffled them, arrange the pogs into a big stack. Make sure that all of the pogs are facedown, so you can't see the design side. The way you win the pogs is by flipping them over using your slammer, so it's important to make sure that they start facedown. Once you've got your stack built up, start the game by flipping the slammer as you would a coin to see who goes first. The slam should pass in counter-clockwise order around the circle, after you find out who goes first. The first player typically gets the most pogs out of the slam. It's a lot harder to flip over a very small stack of pogs. Depending on who you play with, there may be a rule for how you're supposed to hold the slammer. In American Pog tournaments, it was required that the slammer be held between the index finger and the middle finger, and flicked downward, over the back of the wrist. But there are lots of ways to hold the slammer, so it's fun to experiment and see which is best. Here are some common techniques: Hold the slammer flat against the inside of your fingers, and keep it in place with your thumb. Slap it down toward the stack. Curl the slammer into your index finger and hold it with your thumb, like you were going to skip a stone. Hold the slammer like you would a dart, between your index finger and thumb, sideways. Or turn it so the flat side is between your finger and thumb. Take your slammer in whatever grip you've chosen, and forcefully slam it down onto the top of the stack of pogs. Let the slammer go as it makes contact. If you hit it correctly, many of the pogs should flip over onto the other side. You collect all the pogs that you've flipped over. They now are yours, if you're playing for keeps. If you're not, just keep them in your pile until the game is over. Restack the rest of the pogs that didn't flip over into a stack again, still facing down. Pass the slammer to the next player. The game is over when one player has collected more than half the pogs from the stack. The remainder of the pogs go back to whoever put them in to begin with, and the winner keeps the pogs in his pile. If you're not playing for keeps, return all the pogs to whoever started out with them in the first place. The basic game of pog is pretty simple, but you can play a few little variations and specific rules to have more fun. Make up your own, or try some of these common classics: Play best of 15. Some players play that the stack must always remain at 15, but it's not important who puts in more. If you really want to get your best friend's favorite pog, putting in 14 to his 1 might be a daring way to try to gamble for it. Play the pogs where they fall. After the pogs scatter, pick up the ones you flipped, but don't restock them. Instead, play that you have to hit them where they fell. It's a lot harder. Play long-range pogs. In some games, you're allowed to get right up on top of the stack before you slam them. In other games, you have to stand a few feet away, making it much more difficult to actually hit the stack. It adds a little fun to the game. Just keep playing. One of the fun parts of the game is losing pogs, then getting them back, then losing them again. It's fun to keep playing for the same pogs over and over again. If you lost one of your favorites, it'll be easy to get it back in the next game.","completion":"This article explains how to play a game called Pogs, which is about using cardboard and metal discs called Pogs and Slammers to collect the biggest and coolest collection by flipping them over and trading with friends."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Reddit users tracked back through Hamade's previous posts and matched the hard drive and the PC name - thereby allegedly outing him as one of the original leakers. However, he vehemently denied this to the MailOnline. ‘4chan thinks it's me for because of the photoshopped post I made. I am not a hacker. I have no idea how the hell someone could hack into all those accounts.’ Mr Hamade said he had been wrongly identified as the hacker after other internet users launched a ‘witch hunt’ to find the culprit. According to one amateur internet sleuth, he had claimed to own 13 pictures of Miss Lawrence, 24, including four nude photos. He allegedly asked for 100 for each photo but was identified after he posted a screenshot of his computer desktop that showed his ‘network folders’ saved in his name. Mr Hamade added: 'I am just an idiot. who tried to pull one over on 4chan and lost big time. I am not the. original leaker. I only reposted one thing that was posted elsewhere and. stupidly had my network folders visible. Watch Video Here. Mr Hamade tried to sell intimate pictures of actress Jennifer Lawrence (left) in return for the internet currency Bitcoin. Kate Upton (right) was among the list of victims whose accounts on iCloud were allegedly hacked into. The original photos were reportedly stolen via iCloud, before being published on file-sharing website 4chan. 'I'd never in a million years know how to hack into any of the accounts listed. 4chan just attacked me because they like to attack anyone in situations such as this.’ Mr Hamade works for software company Southern Digital Media in Lawrenceville, Georgia. Hamade has taken down all his social media and said that his original plan to profit off the leakers has backfired. And in a further damning twist, a search of the Google cache for Hamade's deleted Twitter feed shows that he sent Olympic gymnast, McKayla Maroney, who was hacked, a message in April of this year. In it he comments on one of her gymnastic performances, saying, 'That's some serious arm dancing.' Why? Reddit users asked Hamade why he interacted with 18-year-old Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney. He said it was an innocent exchange. Indeed, according to his own employers' website, Hamade is qualified in code and a specialist in PHP, MySql, HTML and Java. In another screenshot from the anon-ib message board, where the nude pictures were allegedly collected before being posted onto 4chan, there is a posting from a user known as 'OriginalGuy'. Reddit user claim that OriginalGuy was posting pictures that had appeared only on postings made by Hamade. According to the company’s website, he is a recent graduate of the University of Georgia and is the company’s ‘technical expert’, specializing in several computer programming codes. Hamade says he is now seeking a lawyer to defend himself against any charges that may be brought against him. He also says he is looking for the true leaker. 'The real guy is on 4chan posting intermittently,' Hamade said of the nude photo leaker. 'He’s most likely the one behind it, but it does seem the photos passed around to multiple people before being leaked, so it may just be someone who has them and didn’t hack to get them.' Time-stamp: This post to reddit reveals an argument between Bryan Hamade and another user about the time the Atlanta technician posted pictures to the web-thread service. Cat Deeley (right) was named as a victim whose photographs were stolen, but no supposedly 'nude' images of her have appeared online, while Nickelodeon star Victoria Justice (left) wrote on Twitter her image was. faked. A spokesman for Oscar winner Miss Lawrence has confirmed the photos of her are genuine, saying: 'This is a flagrant violation of privacy. The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.’ Other celebrities named in the list posted by the hacker include Kate Upton, Cat Deeley, Ariana Grande and Victoria Justice. Some in the list have denied the photos are genuine. In other cases, photos have not yet been leaked online. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Bryan Hamade, a 26-year-old software engineer, has denied accusations of stealing nude photos from celebrity iCloud accounts and being the source of an infamous leak. Hamade was identified after attempting to sell explicit photos of actress Jennifer Lawrence in exchange for Bitcoin. He posted some of the images on Reddit under the username BluntMastermind and allegedly tried to sell them for 100 each but denied being the original hacker after internet users on 4chan revealed his real name. Hamade confessed to lying about his connection to the hack but insisted the photo he tried to sell was a fake. Hamade's family has not been contacted by the FBI, but they have experienced harassment from news crews who want to interview them."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Both sentences discuss the properties allowed for particles with different spins, but they diverge in terms of the specific characteristics they focus on. Let's break down each sentence to elucidate the nuances: 1. \\"For example, the spin case only allows a magnetic dipole, but for spin 1 particles magnetic quadrupoles and electric dipoles are also possible.\\" This sentence discusses that, in the case of spin, only magnetic dipoles are allowed. However, when dealing with spin 1 particles, magnetic quadrupoles and electric dipoles are added to the list of possible properties. The sentence emphasizes the allowance of more properties for spin 1 particles. 2. \\"For example, the spin-fall also allows a magnetic dipole, but for spin 1 particles only electric quadrupoles and magnetic dipoles are possible.\\" This sentence introduces the term \\"spin-fall,\\" which is not mentioned in the first sentence. However, it still discusses the allowance of magnetic dipoles. In contrast to the first sentence, this one appears to restrict spin 1 particles to only electric quadrupoles and magnetic dipoles. The emphasis here is on these two specific properties and their exclusivity for spin 1 particles. In conclusion, the two sentences convey related information, mentioning spin, spin 1 particles, and the electromagnetic properties allowed for them. However, they are not direct paraphrases of each other due to differences in emphasis and the introduction of the term \\"spin-fall\\" in the second sentence. The first sentence highlights the additional properties allowed for spin 1 particles, while the second sentence focuses more on the specific properties exclusive to the spin 1 particles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I heard that Remy put change in her kid's wallet but her kid didn't show any reaction. And I was wondering How would Remy feel as a result? Options are: --unharmed by the event --unappreciated by her kid --somewhat indifferent The answer is:","completion":"Remy might feel unappreciated by her kid. To delve into this, we must first understand the motivation behind Remy's action. Typically, parents perform such acts as a form of generosity, an attempt to surprise, or a way to provide for their children without making a big deal out of it. It's a quiet means of looking out for the child's needs or adding a little joy to their day. Let's imagine Remy's thought process in this situation. She procures some extra change, maybe from her purse or the coin jar by the door, and carefully places it in her kid's wallet. She doesn't mention it, hoping that later when her child opens their wallet and sees the unexpected money, they'll feel a mini thrill of surprise and potentially gratitude. When the child shows no reaction after discovering the money, Remy might feel a little deflated, even saddened. In her mind, this was a small act of love, an extra step she took to make her child's day a little better. She was likely looking forward to hearing the excitement or surprise from her child when they found the money. That's why the lack of reaction might make Remy feel unappreciated. It's like she extended her hand, but her child didn't acknowledge the gesture. Remy might question if her child took it for granted or didn't notice it at all. In short, the lack of response potentially makes her feel that her acts of kindness and care are being overlooked. The other options, unharmed by the event or somewhat indifferent, could also be possible reactions. But considering the measure of emotional expectation and investment in her act, feeling unappreciated seems likely to be the most dominant emotion in this situation. However, it's also essential to remember that emotions can be complex and diverse. People respond differently to the same events. While feeling unappreciated would seem a most likely response given these circumstances, Remy might still experience a spectrum of other emotions not explicitly presented in the given options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paraphrasing involves rewording or restructuring a text without altering its meaning. In the context of these two sentences, they both share some common information, but there are also discrepancies. Similarities between the two sentences: 1. Both sentences mention the Canadian Fencibles, which is an infantry unit. 2. Both sentences discuss the years 1803 and 1805 as significant milestones. 3. Both sentences talk about joining the Canadian Fencibles in some manner. 4. Both sentences involve Quebec and Scotland as locations of interest. Now, let's examine the discrepancies between the two sentences: 1. In the first sentence, the individual is said to have joined the Canadian Fencibles in Quebec in 1803 and moved with them to Scotland in 1805. This provides a clear timeline emphasizing the person's initial association with Quebec and then their subsequent relocation to Scotland. 2. In the second sentence, the initial joining takes place in Scotland in 1803, while the connection with Quebec happens in 1805. This timeline is reversed from the first sentence, highlighting the individual's association with Scotland first and later shifting to Quebec. In conclusion, while these sentences may be considered paraphrases due to their similarities and the fact that they both focus on the Canadian Fencibles, their differences in presenting the timeline and geographical sequence of the events significantly change the overall interpretation. A true paraphrase should retain the original meaning of the sentence while restructuring the phrasing. Since the two sentences offer distinct interpretations of the events, they cannot be accurately considered as paraphrases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

How many houses are there in Downing Street?","completion":"Downing Street, located in the City of Westminster, London, is a significant address in British politics, as it houses key political offices, including the residence of the Prime Minister. While it may be well-known for the iconic black door of Number 10, Downing Street has more than just one house. The street itself was named after Sir George Downing, a diplomat who served under Oliver Cromwell and King Charles II. In the 1680s, as a part of Sir Christopher Wren's planning initiatives, 20 terraced houses were built on Downing Street. However, over the years, some of these original houses were demolished, remodeled, or combined with other units, leading to a reduction in their overall count. Today, three main houses are situated on Downing Street, each serving an essential purpose: 1. Number 10 Downing Street: The official residence and office of the British Prime Minister since 1735, beginning with Sir Robert Walpole. This Grade I listed building is a symbol of the government's executive branch, serving as the central location for administration and decision-making. The 'Number 10' facade, along with the iconic black door, is well-known around the world. 2. Number 11 Downing Street: Traditionally serving as the official residence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, this building is located right next to Number 10. It has been the residence for chancellors since the early 19th century and also contains offices for the Chancellor's staff. Apart from being the residence, Number 11 plays a role in the iconic \\"budget day\\" photo opportunity, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer announces the budget holding the red budget box. 3. Number 12 Downing Street: This address is currently home to the offices of the Government Chief Whip for the House of Commons. The Chief Whip is responsible for ensuring that members of their party vote according to the party line and attend important parliamentary sessions. Downing Street houses several offices, meeting rooms, and private accommodations, all interlinked as a single complex to support the functioning of the British government. While the original terraced houses may have degraded in number, the political prominence and significance of Downing Street have only increased over the years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After Brad introduces his friend, Wolf Wigo, and Wolf shares his own tips about water polo, the most logical next event in the sequence would be for Brad to return to talking about swimming while Wolf watches. This would provide a natural progression of the conversation and allow for both Brad and Wolf to share their expertise, insights, and experiences in their respective disciplines. In this scenario, Brad could continue discussing the intricacies and techniques of swimming by demonstrating effective swimming strokes or explaining how to improve endurance and speed in the water. This would complement Wolf's water polo tips and create an informative and engaging experience for the audience. Meanwhile, Wolf would watch Brad as he talks about swimming and possibly contribute his own thoughts from a water polo player's perspective. This would not only emphasize the common ground between swimming and water polo but also help showcase the distinct aspects of each sport. The other options do not seem as logical as option C. In option A, Brad losing and falling into the water would not contribute meaningfully to the content and may come across as unnatural or staged. Option B, interviewing another swimmer who swims away out of the camera range, would disrupt the flow of the segment and introduce unnecessary confusion and discontinuity for the audience. Lastly, option D, where Brad explains his skills as a water polo player, might dilute the focus of the conversation and make it less informative for the audience.

Please answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who patented the first rigid-hulled inflatable boat? , can you please find it? Hearst died in August 1951. The castle remained on the market for the following decade until bought in 1960 by Antonin Besse II, son of the late Sir Antonin Besse, and donated to the founding council of Atlantic College. Besse was a patron and honorary vice-president of the United World Colleges. The idea for an international school arose from a meeting between the educationalist Kurt Hahn, who founded Gordonstoun, and Air Marshal Sir Lawrence Darvall, the commandant of the NATO Defense College. They conceived of a college for 16–19-year-old students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding. With Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare, the first headmaster, they persuaded Besse that the castle would make a suitable location for the first United World College, which opened in 1962 with fifty-six students.The first rigid-hulled inflatable boat was patented by Hoare at St Donat's in the 1960s. In an act of generosity, Hoare sold the patent for the boat to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1973 for a notional £1; the RNLI's cheque was not cashed and remains at the castle. From 1963 until 2013 the castle hosted an RNLI lifeboat station which was credited with saving ninety-eight lives along the South Wales coast during its period of operation. The college's early years were financially precarious, but major fund-raising efforts led by Sir George Schuster strengthened the financial position in the mid-1960s.The fiftieth anniversary of the college in 2012 was celebrated with a visit to the site by Queen Noor of Jordan, President of the United World Colleges Foundation. As at 2017, the college was home to 350 students from more than 90 countries. The Hearst Corporation maintains a connection with St Donat's through a sponsorship programme for students at the college. With a history of occupation from its construction in the late 13th century, St Donat's has been described as the oldest continuously inhabited castle in Wales.","completion":"The first name of the person who patented the first rigid-hulled inflatable boat is Desmond, as mentioned in the article: \\"The first rigid-hulled inflatable boat was patented by Hoare at St Donat's in the 1960s.\\" The full name is Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does it follow that \\"What about Shannon caused her to kill Drew?\\"?","completion":"Shannon and Drew were both complex individuals, each having their personal issues and experiences that shaped their personalities and relationships. They were involved in a somewhat tumultuous and complicated dynamic, which ultimately led to the tragic event that unfolded between them. To fully understand what it was about Shannon that prodded Drew in this way, we must first look into the various factors that come into play concerning their respective backgrounds, interactions, and motives. It's important to remember that while we can analyze and identify potential influences, we can't know exactly what occurred or what each person was thinking or feeling leading up to the tragedy. 1. Shannon's background and personality: Shannon may have had a troubled past or experienced trauma that shaped her behavior and coping mechanisms. This could have manifested as mental health issues, emotional instability, or difficulty maintaining healthy relationships. It is possible that some aspects of her history or personality contributed to her actions. 2. Relationship dynamic: Shannon and Drew might have shared an intense or volatile relationship. They could have had a history of arguments, jealousy, or mistrust that culminated in this event. There may have been an escalating pattern of abuse or manipulation, either perpetrated by Shannon or experienced by her from Drew. Alternatively, Shannon may have felt threatened or cornered in some way that prompted her to take this extreme action. 3. Underlying motives: There could have been a specific motive or reason underlying Shannon's actions. For instance, she might have been seeking revenge for a perceived slight or betrayal, attempting to protect herself or others from a perceived threat, or struggling with feelings of humiliation or indignation. Uncovering such motives is essential to understanding why Shannon decided to take this course of action. 4. Emotional & mental state: At the time of the event, Shannon may have been experiencing emotional or psychological distress that pushed her towards this action. This could include feelings of desperation, anger, or fear, or symptoms of a mental health disorder such as anxiety, depression, or even a psychotic episode. 5. Societal and cultural factors: It's important to recognize that external forces, such as societal norms, cultural expectations, or peer pressure may have played a role in this situation. These factors can often influence an individual's thoughts, feelings, and actions, and may have contributed to Shannon's decision to kill Drew. The original query seems to imply that there was something specific about Shannon that caused her to kill Drew. While it is possible that certain traits or behaviors of Shannon may have led her down this path, it is also important to consider that a combination of elements – background, relationship dynamic, motives, mental and emotional state, and societal factors – likely contributed to the tragic event.

In this view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features. These features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle. The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form).

Question: Where would a rosebush be most likely to die due to lack of water? - canada - the desert - indiana - california - backyard The best answer is Answer:","completion":"The rosebush would be most likely to die due to lack of water in a desert environment. A rosebush, like any other plant, requires a certain amount of water for growth and survival. An absence or severe limitation of water would most commonly occur in an excessively dry, water-deprived environment such as a desert. Deserts are characterized by severe aridity and minimal rainfall. They also experience high temperatures during the day which quickly evaporates the small amount of moisture that may be present, making it extremely difficult for most plants to survive. Thus, the chances of a rosebush dying due to lack of water would be highest in such conditions. Though Canada, Indiana, and California have regions with varying levels of rainfall and dry seasons, they also have seasons where moisture is abundant due to rainfall or snow. These places generally have a more balanced climate and hence, it is less likely for a rosebush to die from lack of water in these locations, given that proper garden care is administered. A rosebush may also die of water scarcity in a backyard, but this is highly dependent on localized conditions and care provided by the homeowner. If the backyard has poor drainage or is not irrigated frequently enough, the rosebush could potentially die due to an inadequate amount of water. However, unlike the extreme conditions in a desert, water supply in a backyard is generally under human control and can be adjusted based on the needs of the plant. However, it's important to note that excessive watering can also harm the rosebush. Roses, in general, prefer well-drained, loamy soils. If they are waterlogged for extended periods, it could lead to root rot and other diseases. In conclusion, out of the places provided - Canada, the desert, Indiana, California, and a backyard - a rosebush would be most likely to die due to lack of water in the desert due to its harsh, dry conditions and extreme evaporation rates. The other locations offer more tolerable and variable climates where a balance of environmental factors and appropriate care can foster the survival and growth of a rosebush."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which is higher on the food chain, deer or cats? Context: In intelligent mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum is larger relative to the rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey. The answer is:","completion":"To extract the answer, I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the main subject of the question - In this case, the main subject is the food chain and determining whether deer or cats are higher on it. 2. Scan the provided context for any parts that discuss the food chain or the comparison between deer and cats. 3. Extract the relevant information and present it as the answer. In the given context, I found this sentence: \\"In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.\\" From this sentence, we can deduce that since cats need to think and outwit their prey, they are higher on the food chain as predators. On the other hand, deer feed on plants, positioning them lower on the food chain as herbivores. The answer is: Cats are higher on the food chain than deer."},{"prompt":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: One night Mr White left his car outside his house as usual.

Within a few weeks, her son proclaimed himself her co-ruler as King Charles I of Castile and Aragon. Charles had been raised in Netherlands and his affairs were mostly controlled by the Flemish noble William de Croÿ, sieur de Chièvres. In 1517, the seventeen-year-old King sailed to Castile, where he was formally recognised as King of Castile. There, his Flemish court provoked much scandal, as de Croÿ shamelessly sold government privileges for personal money and installed other Flemish nobles into government offices. In May 1518, Charles traveled to Barcelona in Aragon, where he would remain for nearly two years. Here, he haggled with Aragon's slightly stronger cortes, the Generalitat, for privileges and his formal recognition as King of Aragon. Aragon managed to maintain more local control than Castile did, but mostly because Aragon was poorer and there was no point in pressing the issue for extra tax money that wasn't there to be collected. In 1519, the King's paternal grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, died. Charles competed with King Francis I of France to win the imperial election by aggressively bribing prince-electors. Charles won, becoming Emperor Charles V. He left Aragon to return to Castile to raise funds to pay down the debts he had incurred in the election. The taxes granted to Charles at a Castilian cortes in Corunna would help spark the Revolt of the Comuneros of Castile. Of more importance for Aragon, in the summer of 1519 Charles granted his permission to the Germanies to arm themselves against the raiding Muslim fleets. While permission had previously been granted under Ferdinand, Charles was able to force the Valencian nobles to accept this decision. Who was Joanna's father?","completion":"Joanna's father was Ferdinand II of Aragon, also known as Ferdinand the Catholic.

Context: Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean. So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.

Summarize the following: If you are familiar to at-home spa treatments, you may already have some of the necessary supplies on hand. Check your cupboards for epsom salts, nail clippers, an emery board, a cuticle pusher, a file (or pumice stone), cuticle cream, toe separators, nail polish remover and nail polish. Although not all of these tools are absolutely required, having all of them will result in a salon-finish at-home pedicure, rather than an amateur one. If you are lacking any of the above ingredients, visit your local beauty supply store and pick them up. Talk with the store clerks and ask which tools are best for at-home use versus salon use. Some manicure and pedicure kits are designed for professionals, and will contain tools you will likely not use. Purchase the basic needs for your at-home pedicure, leaving salon-grade tools to the professionals. Do not assume cheaper means better; although you do not need a set of professional pedicure set, you do not want a set that is flimsy, either. Test the strength of the tools, and make sure the metal is thick enough to resist bending. Purchase a clean bucket, if necessary, and some epsom salts for soaking your feet. Although you can use many things in the place of epsom salts, such as magnesium and specialized foot soaks, epsom salts are inexpensive, relaxing, and effective. Ideally, use a bucket that can house both of your feet simultaneously. Although you can soak one foot at a time, soaking both feet at the same time will be more comfortable and will make the process go by more quickly. Before you begin your pedicure, lay down a towel or two to catch any stray water, and to dry off your feet after your soak. Have an extra hand towel and old rag at the ready in case of spills or polish mishaps. If possible, do your pedicure on a hard surface, such as tile or linoleum, as these are water-resistant. If you are working on carpet or wood, clean up any spills quickly. Choose towels you don't mind getting dirty or worn down. Although you will want to avoid a spill of any of your ingredients, they do happen, and both nail polish and nail polish remover stain fabric. At-home pedicures can involve 10-30 minutes of downtime. Grab a book, turn on some music, or turn on your favorite show to keep your mind engaged while you soak and clean. If you struggle to multitask, put in some classical music to avoid cutting your nails too short or spilling your ingredients.","completion":"To achieve a salon-finish at-home pedicure, gather required supplies like epsom salts, nail clippers, an emery board, cuticle pusher, a file or pumice stone, cuticle cream, toe separators, nail polish remover, and nail polish.

It is supposed to be guaranteed but the construction is poor and I will buy a different brand next time. Answer:","completion":"The given product review would significantly decrease the chances of me buying the product. There are various reasons for this decision, which I will detail below. 1. Poor construction: The reviewer explicitly states that the construction of the product is poor, which raises concerns about its durability and overall quality. As a potential buyer, I would be hesitant to purchase a product that may not withstand normal use or requires additional effort to maintain. 2. Lid issues: The reviewer mentions that the lid came off the hinge on the second day of use. This implies that the product has a design flaw or subpar craftsmanship. Regardless of whether it can be easily fixed with glue, this issue demonstrates that the product may not meet my expectations for longevity or hassle-free usage. 3. Damage by animals: The review states that squirrels were able to pull the feeder apart within two weeks. This indicates that the product may not be designed to withstand the typical interactions with wildlife, which could result in frequent repairs or replacements. 4. Ineffective guarantee: The reviewer notes that the product is supposed to be guaranteed, but the poor construction makes this guarantee seem unreliable. As a potential buyer, I would prefer to purchase a product with a reliable guarantee or warranty to ensure that I receive a quality item with proper customer support if needed. 5. Intent to switch brands: The reviewer comments that they would buy a different brand next time, signaling dissatisfaction with the current product. This implies that the negative experience may be significant enough to prompt the reviewer to actively seek alternatives in the future. As a potential buyer, this would make me more likely to consider other options or brands as well. In conclusion, the given review would notably decrease the chances of me buying the product. The poor construction, design flaws, and lack of durability paired with an ineffective guarantee and the reviewer's preference for another brand raise concerns related to the product's quality and long-term usability. As someone looking to invest in a reliable feeder, I would be more inclined to explore alternative options that offer better quality and come with stronger recommendations from satisfied customers."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Polluted water may contain chemicals or toxins which can accumulate in birds' bodies, weakening their immune systems or causing other health issues. With a dwindling or tainted food supply, the population of birds would likely decrease. 2. Loss of habitat: Air and water pollution could damage or destroy the habitats where birds live, nest, and raise their offspring. Deforestation, pollution in water bodies and wetlands, or air pollution can all contribute to a decline in suitable habitats for various bird species. As these environments grow less inhabitable, the number of birds in those areas would decline. 3. Disturbance in reproduction: Chemicals released in the environment through pollution can interfere with the reproduction process of birds. Exposure to certain pollutants has been linked to eggshell thinning, defects in offspring, and reproductive failure. Furthermore, contaminated areas may make it difficult for birds to build nests and raise their young, further decreasing their populations. 4. Impact on migratory birds: Increased pollution levels may impact the migration patterns of birds who travel long distances to breed, raise their young, and escape harsh climates. Some migrating birds may be unable to navigate as efficiently due to air pollution or toxic chemicals present in the environment, which could negatively impact their ability to reach important breeding grounds or food sources. B. Less impact on birds: 1. Adaptation: Some bird species may possess a greater ability to adapt to environmental changes than others. These hardier species could find ways to overcome the challenges posed by pollution or utilize the resources still available to them in polluted areas. 2. Evolutionary changes: Over time, bird populations could evolve to better cope with the effects of pollution. Natural selection could favor individuals with traits that enable them to survive and reproduce in polluted environments. However, this would be a long-term process and may not be enough to counteract the immediate effects of increased pollution levels. C. No effect on birds: It is unlikely that increased environmental pollution would have no effect on bird populations. While some species may fare better than others, the overall impact of pollution on ecosystems, food sources, and habitats would likely result in negative consequences for most birds. Human intervention, such as creating pollution-free habitats, may help mitigate some of these effects, but the reduction of pollution levels would ultimately be the most effective solution for preserving bird populations. In conclusion, the answer would be (A) more impact on birds. Increased environmental pollution would most likely lead to more significant negative effects on bird populations, with only a few hardier species managing to adapt or evolve to cope with the changes. The best way to minimize these adverse effects would be to reduce pollution levels and maintain healthy ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

POST : Disclaimer: I do not support any discrimination between races or support racist organizations, please don’t take it that way. So me and my table group were chatting. We have this Asian kid who’s racist, like really racist. He says the n-word with a hard r at least 50 times a day at my school. The Asian kid started making racist jokes. Literally everyone at our table, black, white, or Hispanic/Asian were laughing at them. It’s not something to laugh at, but we all knew he wasn’t being serious. At least, I think that. I used to be his friend (before he starting being really racist with the N-word) and I thought I’d share some of my racist jokes with him. Not because I particularly liked that he was racist, just because he used to be my friend. Oddly enough, he gets offended whenever someone says something about Chinese people. I whispered my jokes, and he started laughing. I laughed too, they were (kinda) funny. Now believe me when I say I don’t support racism, because it’s disgusting, but I don’t think it’s racist (unless you mean it to be) to tell jokes and laugh at them. This one short kid — let’s call him Joseph — had a different opinion. Joseph decided he would go over and tell one of my black friends that I had made racist jokes. (The Asian kid decided to tell everyone at my table I made those jokes, so that’s how Joseph knew.) I wasn’t even intending to oppress or make fun of him because of his skin color, it was a joke. Please believe me when I say I did not mean it to oppress black people. Joseph might have a grudge with me, because he keeps trying to start this and make it into a big thing. So now my black friend is mad at me. Am I the Asshole for laughing at racist jokes and telling them? Note: I believe that comedy (whether right or wrong) will always create new jokes out of sensitive topics. I do admit that I shouldn’t have told those racist jokes, but I also can’t go back in time.

For bottling his homemade apple cider, he switched from tall, plastic jars to stout glass jars because the","completion":"glass jars provided a more airtight seal, which helped to preserve the freshness and flavor of the cider for longer periods of time. This decision was made after careful consideration and research on the optimal methods of storage for homemade apple cider. In addition, glass jars are less permeable to oxygen, which can negatively affect the taste and quality of the cider if it seeps in during storage. Oxygen is an enemy of cider, as it can cause oxidation and spoilage, resulting in off-flavors. The stout glass jars effectively reduced the chances of this occurring, ensuring that each bottle of cider remained delicious and enjoyable for as long as possible. Additionally, the durable nature of glass jars allowed them to be reused multiple times, minimizing waste and making the switch more environmentally friendly. Plastic jars, on the other hand, tend to wear out and need to be replaced more often, contributing to increased waste production. Moreover, the aesthetic appeal of glass jars played a role in his decision. The stout jars with their transparent nature showcased the beautiful golden hue of the cider, making it even more appealing to friends and family who received it as a gift. The overall presentation was elevated, helping to convey the care, thought, and effort that went into producing the homemade apple cider. Furthermore, the glass jars provided better UV protection for the cider compared to plastic jars. Exposure to UV light can degrade the flavor and quality of the cider over time. To prevent such instances, the switch to glass jars proved advantageous in preserving the cider's integrity. Lastly, he noticed that using glass jars provided an added advantage during the bottling process. The non-porous nature of glass made it easier to properly sterilize the jars, which is essential in preventing any unwanted bacteria or contaminants from spoiling the cider. Thus, by systematically considering the aspects of preservation, reusability, aesthetics, UV protection, and ease of sanitization, the switch from tall, plastic jars to stout glass jars not only improved the quality of his homemade apple cider but also contributed to a more eco-friendly and visually appealing approach to bottling it."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest. He then spots two gamekeepers and hides from them, but then he hears them talking to someone in a deep hole in the ground; when they walk off to tell Hazell, Danny goes over and finds that the man in the hole is William,...

In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Brazil Sues Twitter Over Speed Trap, Roadblock Tweets In what may be the first test of Twitter‘s new international censorship strategy, Brazil is suing the company over tweets that warn drivers of police roadblocks and speed traps. The suit, filed in a federal court in Goias by the attorney general’s office, is also going after users who compose the tweets. Brazil’s government is levying fines of 290,000 until Twitter changes course. The government charges that such tweets break the law and directly endanger “life, safety and property,” CNN reports. The roadblocks, the suit contends, may thwart purveyors of other crimes like car theft, weapons smuggling and drug trafficking.” A judge is currently reviewing the case. Reps from Twitter could not be reached for comment. Brazil’s challenge comes less than two weeks after Twitter announced that it was giving itself the right to withhold content in certain countries, while making the content available in the rest of the world. Previously, Twitter’s only recourse for censoring such tweets was to remove the content globally. “We haven’t yet used this ability, but if and when we are required to withhold a tweet in a specific country, we will attempt to let the user know, and we will clearly mark when the content has been withheld,” read a post on Twitter’s blog on Jan. 26. Twitter expanded its relationship with Chilling Effects, an organization that collects and analyzes legal complaints about online activity, to update users about which posts were being censored. In a follow-up post written the next day, Twitter expanded on the topic, stating that it would not filter posts going forward, but will only withhold content when the company determines a legal request is “valid and applicable.” Addressing the reason behind the timing of the announcement, the post continued, “There’s no magic to the timing of this feature. We’ve been working to reduce the scope of withholding, while increasing transparency, for a while. We have users all over the world and wanted to find a way to deal with requests in the least restrictive way.” Is Brazil right in trying to censor such tweets or should the tweets flow regardless of the consequences? Let us know in the comments. Image courtesy of Wikipedia Commons","completion":"Brazil is suing Twitter because some people are sending messages about where police are hiding to catch drivers who are going too fast or breaking other rules.

The film, produced by Asylum, is directed by Cole McKay, and it can be considered a 'mockbuster' since it was released around the same time as the Paul W. S. Anderson film \\"The Three Musketeers.\\" As the paragraph points out that the film is based on the famous novel by Alexandre Dumas, we can conclude that \\"3 Musketeers\\" is indeed based on \\"The Three Musketeers.\\" However, it is important to note that this film adaptation might not faithfully follow the original story, as it is described as being \\"loosely based\\" on the source material. The term \\"loosely based\\" typically implies that there might have been some significant changes made to the original story, character arcs, or timeline while adapting it into a new format, such as a film in this case. It could be the setting, the number of characters, the order of events, or even the tone of the story that may not align with the original. Furthermore, the label \\"mockbuster\\" indicates that the film aims to capitalize on the popularity and success of a bigger, more widely-known production (in this case, the Paul W. S. Anderson film \\"The Three Musketeers\\"). In order to maximize the potential profits, the mockbuster production might take certain liberties in its adaptation or presentation of the source material to differentiate itself or to appeal to a wider or different audience. Taking these factors into consideration, while \\"3 Musketeers\\" is indeed based on \\"The Three Musketeers,\\" potential viewers should be aware that the film might not accurately or faithfully represent the nuances and details of the original work by Alexandre Dumas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"The truth of the second sentence depends on the context and the particular task the speaker is referring to in both sentences. Let's analyze both sentences separately first and then attempt to determine the relationship between the two. Sentence 1: \\"and uh and uh i don't know how we're going to do that right away though but what what in general though that taxes are doing to us is it's just taking uh a bite out of our savings\\" In this sentence, the speaker is expressing uncertainty about how to accomplish a specific task \\"right away\\" and goes on to say that taxes, in general, are affecting them negatively by reducing their savings. The speaker's focus in this sentence is primarily on the negative impact of taxes, while mentioning a task that they are unsure of how to accomplish immediately. Sentence 2: \\"I'm not sure about how to do that right away.\\" In the second sentence, the speaker is again expressing uncertainty about accomplishing a specific task immediately. There isn't any mention of taxes or their impact on savings in this sentence. Now, let's attempt to determine the relationship between the two sentences and whether the truth of the first sentence implies the truth of the second sentence. The similarities between the two sentences are that both are expressing the speaker's uncertainty about how to accomplish a task right away. However, the first sentence specifically mentions the negative effect of taxes on savings, while the second sentence does not have any reference to taxes or their impact. It's important to note that the unspecified task in both sentences could be associated with finding a solution or managing the negative effects of taxes mentioned in the first sentence. Therefore, if the first sentence is true and the speaker is genuinely unsure about how to deal with the task right away, it's logical to assume that they would also be unsure about it in the second sentence. In conclusion, based on the information provided and the context in which both sentences are written, it is reasonable to assume that if the first sentence is true, the second sentence is likely to be true as well. Both sentences express the speaker's uncertainty regarding the immediate accomplishment of a task, which could potentially be related to managing or mitigating the negative effects of taxes on their savings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, there is a slight difference in the focus of each question. The first question, \\"How can I have better sex with my wife?\\" emphasizes the role of the individual asking the question. This suggests that the person is looking for ways they can personally contribute to creating a better sexual experience for themselves and their partner. The emphasis on \\"I\\" makes the question more specific to the person's personal role in the situation. The second question, \\"How can we do better sex?\\" focuses on the collective steps that both partners can take to improve their sexual experiences. Using \\"we\\" implies that the responsibility for improvement is shared between both people involved and may result in a mutual effort to find solutions or new techniques. Despite the subtle differences in focus, these questions aim to achieve a similar outcome of enhanced sexual experiences for the couple. Therefore, the answer is \\"yes,\\" these questions can be considered the same in terms of the overall goal. To answer both questions, it's important to consider various aspects that can result in better sex, including open communication about desires and boundaries, trying new experiences or positions, engaging in foreplay, and fostering emotional intimacy.

The paragraph is discussing how differently a cat reacts when it has an allergy, and this option continues with that train of thought, detailing an example of a reaction a cat could have (itchy skin leading to excessive grooming and pulling hair out), and comparing this to the variety of allergic reactions humans can have (peanut allergy, seafood allergy, hay fever, etc). Other options don't fit the existing context as well: the first option is confusing and doesn't connect to cat allergies. The second option mentions a potential reaction, but it is difficult to understand and doesn't link well to the previous sentence.

Once launched she joined Admiral Henry Osborn’s fleet of 14 ships of the line in the Mediterranean. Osborn was at the time blockading the French under Admiral La Clue in the Spanish city of Cartagena preventing them from joining the fleet off Louisburg in Nova Scotia. French command had ordered the Marquis Duquesne to break through the British blockade and reinforce La Clue and then with superiority of numbers break out of Cartagena and make their way to America. Osborn intercepted Duquesne and his three ships of the line and one frigate. The subsequent action became known as the Battle of Cartagena and took place on 28 February 1758. Osborn's squadron captured two of the French line of battle ships and, under the guns of the Spanish castle the 60-gun French Oriflamme was driven on shore by the Montagu and the . Whilst the battle was not particularly grand the annihilation of the forces under Duquesne had two distinct effects. Firstly, the battle restored much of the pride that had been sapped from the navy after several defeats including those at Toulon and Minorca. Secondly, the siege of Louisburg and its surrender led to the French being marginalised as a significant power in North America. The battle can therefore be considered by the British as one of the defining achievements of the Seven Years' War.

Are \\"her\\" and \\"mistress\\" the same?","completion":"In the given sentence, it can be inferred that the pronoun \\"her\\" most likely refers to \\"Nelly,\\" the crippled sister, and not to \\"our mistress.\\" The context of the sentence provides evidence for this interpretation. The sentence begins by explaining that \\"our mistress\\" hired a room for \\"Nelly,\\" the speaker's crippled sister. The relationship between \\"our mistress\\" and \\"Nelly\\" is established at this point. The sentence then goes on to describe what the mistress did for Nelly: she gave her knitting and needlework when Nelly could manage it, provided her with meals and other comforts when she was not well, and was a mother figure to Nelly. When analyzing the pronoun \\"her\\" in this sentence, it is important to consider the most likely antecedent, based on context. Since all the actions in the sentence are connected to the relationship between \\"our mistress\\" and the speaker's sister \\"Nelly,\\" it is more plausible that the pronoun \\"her\\" refers to \\"Nelly\\" and not to \\"our mistress.\\" Moreover, the term \\"our mistress\\" implies that the speaker has a relationship with the mistress. Thus, the pronoun \\"her\\" would typically be used to refer back to an antecedent mentioned earlier in the sentence, which is Nelly in this context. The pronoun \\"her\\" also correctly serves to link the actions of the mistress to the person receiving those actions, i.e., Nelly. In summary, based on context, the pronoun \\"her\\" in the given sentence likely refers to \\"Nelly,\\" the crippled sister, and not to \\"our mistress.\\" The actions of the mistress described in the sentence are all connected to Nelly and her well-being, and the pronoun \\"her\\" serves to correctly link the two characters and their roles."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 1: Read the package and instructions First, I checked the packaging and instructions to confirm that the cream was indeed meant for the body and not the face. Facial skin is generally more sensitive than body skin, and using a body cream on my face may lead to adverse effects. Step 2: Wash my hands Before applying any cream, I made sure to wash my hands thoroughly with soap and water to minimize the risk of transferring bacteria or any other harmful substances to my skin. Step 3: Cleanse the belly area To ensure proper absorption of the cream, I cleansed my belly area using a mild soap and lukewarm water. Then, I gently patted the area dry with a soft towel, being careful not to rub or cause irritation. Step 4: Apply the cream to my belly Following the instructions provided, I took a small amount of the cream and gently massaged it into my belly, using circular motions to promote circulation and even distribution. I continued massaging the cream until it was fully absorbed. Step 5: Allow the cream to absorb I made sure to give the cream ample time to penetrate my skin for maximum effectiveness. To avoid rubbing the cream off, I wore loose clothing and avoided any strenuous activities that could cause excessive sweating in the area. Step 6: Monitor for skin reactions As with any new skincare product, it's essential to monitor the treated area closely for any signs of adverse reactions like irritation, redness, or excessive dryness. If I were to experience any such symptoms, I would discontinue use and consult a dermatologist, if needed. By choosing to use the cream only on my belly and not on my face, I ensured the safety and efficacy of the product while adhering to the manufacturer's guidelines. This approach allowed me to take full advantage of the cream's benefits without risking any potential harm to my more sensitive facial skin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this article, we will explore their journey as husband and wife and reveal the length of their marriage before fate intervened. Step 1: Research the historical timeline of John II and Blanche I To answer this question, it is essential to understand the historical timeline surrounding their marriage and reign. Step 2: Identify the dates of their marriage and Blanche I's death John II, also known as John the Good, was the King of France from 1350 until his death in 1364. Blanche I, the first queen consort of Navarre, became the wife of John II in one of the most significant ceremonies in French history. Their marriage took place on January 22, 1350. Blanche I's life was, however, tragically cut short when she passed away on August 5, 1398.

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve the equation, we will combine like terms and isolate the variable k. Here's a step-by-step breakdown: 1. Start with the original equation: 38*k + 112 = 52*k - 30*k 2. Simplify the right-hand side of the equation by combining like terms (k-terms) which are 52*k and -30*k: 38*k + 112 = (52*k - 30*k) 3. Calculate combined k terms like so: 52*k - 30*k = 22*k 4. Replace the simplified expression in the right-hand side of the equation: 38*k + 112 = 22*k 5. To isolate the variable k, subtract 22*k from both sides of the equation, to cancel it out on the right-hand side: 38*k - 22*k + 112 = 22*k - 22*k 6. Simplify the left-hand side of the equation by subtracting the k-terms: (38*k - 22*k) = 16*k 7. The equation now looks like this: 16*k + 112 = 0 8. Now, we need to isolate k. To do this, subtract 112 from both sides of the equation: 16*k + 112 - 112 = 0 - 112 9. Simplify the equation: 16*k = -112 10. Finally, to find the value of k, divide both sides of the equation by 16: k = -112 / 16 11.

Ask Boris and Call Clegg have consistently made headlines, as listeners question London's Mayor and the Deputy Prime Minister on their policies and current events. Mr Johnson dedicated the prize to the programme's production team, without whom, he said, he was just \\"an overweight Belgian tourist\\" on the Alpine slopes of live radio. He also thanked \\"the people of London, who have listened in their dozens.\\" It was one of three awards for commercial broadcaster LBC, which went national last year. However, the BBC dominated the ceremony, formerly known as the Sony Awards, topping 22 of the ceremony's 34 categories. BBC Radio 4 won more top prizes than any other station, with gold awards for best music documentary (Strange Fruit), best drama (The Morpeth Carol) and best comedy (The Secret World). Winifred Robinson's moving, illuminating interview with the father of murdered toddler Jamie Bulger was named interview of the year. And John Sergeant handed the best news programme prize to Radio 4's PM. Asked by host Chris Evans to explain why Jeremy Paxman had quit Newsnight, the former political correspondent replied: \\"He wants to be a ballroom dancer\\". Commercial station Absolute got four awards, including best speech programme for Frank Skinner's weekly show. \\"This is like The Hungry Caterpillar winning the Booker Prize,\\" said the comedian. Radio 1 took three awards, including best entertainment show for drivetime host Greg James, and best documentary for Tempted by Teacher, an investigation of student-teacher relationships. Evening show DJ Zane Lowe, meanwhile, was named music broadcaster of the year for the fifth time. \\"Thanks to the academy for recognising that I love music,\\" said the New Zealander, whose bizarre interview with Kanye West went viral last year. \\"That's all I'm here to do - to put music and audiences together.\\" He was given his award by Kaiser Chiefs singer Ricky Wilson, who was sporting an eyepatch, after an accident on the set of his latest music video. \\"I only had time to apply mascara to one eye,\\" he joked. \\"It's all affectation, like Chris Eubank with his monocle.\\" Chris Evans failed to win the Music Radio Personality of the Year category, which went to Sam Pinkham and Amy Voce, who present the breakfast show on East Midlands station Gem 106. \\"Oh crumbs!\\" said Voce, who apologised to the Radio 2 host as she took to the stage. \\"This is really awkward, because our heroes are in this category.\\" Lisa Snowdon and Dave Berry won breakfast show of the year for their \\"original, confident\\" slot on Capital FM, while Danny Baker won speech presenter of the year for his 5 live show. Blackburn's career has been full of high-profile presenting jobs, including being the first DJ to broadcast on Radio 1 when it launched in September 1967 - a station where he spent 17 years. He then presented BBC London's weekday mid-morning show before becoming one of the launch presenters on Capital Gold. Since 2010 he has hosted Radio 2's Pick of the Pops, and he also currently presents shows on BBC London 94.9, BBC Radio Berkshire, the Magic network, BBC3CR and KMFM. He was presented with his Gold Award by Graham Norton, whose own Radio show precedes Pick of the Pops on Saturday mornings. \\"My greatest pleasure at Radio 2 is every Saturday morning when Tony comes into our studio,\\" said Norton. \\"He bounces in and I go, 'how are you Tony?' \\"And he replies: 'Still not arrested!'\\" In his speech, Blackburn thanked his many employers over the years, and made special mention of Radio Caroline founder Ronan O'Rahilly. \\"I've never heard anyone say thanks to Ronan,\\" he said, \\"but he's the man who started it all. \\"I'm very grateful to Radio Caroline.

A former international ice dancer has returned to the rink - three years after going completely blind.Tracy Compton, 45, says she used her sense of hearing to avoid other skaters. In her early 20s, she travelled the world, competing for Great Britain in international synchronised skating competitions. At 13, Miss Compton, of Morden, south west London, lost the sight in her left eye through a detached retina. Back in the game: Former international ice dancer Tracy Compton has returned to the rink three years after glaucoma left her completely blind. Nearly 30 years later, glaucoma claimed the sight in her right eye, leaving her completely blind. Skating since she was five years old, Ms Compton 'took to it like a duck to water' going on to spend six hours a day skating in her teens. Ms Compton stopped skating when she had her first three children. After returning to it briefly in her early thirties, she stopped again when her mum died in 2007. 'My mum used to work in the ice rink shop. When I lost her it was quite hard to go back,' said Ms Compton. Supported to get back on the ice by a friend and fellow skater, Ms Compton said: 'I was transported back in time. It was like I'd never been off the ice.' Heightened senses: Tracy, who suffered detached retinas in her left eye at the age of 13, says she manages to avoid other skaters using her sense of hearing. Ms Compton uses her hearing to avoid collisions with other skaters. She said: 'You can hear somebody's movements. I can hear the skates on the ice. 'Different moves sound different, like going forward or backwards sound different. I never really thought about it before.' 'I'm an ice dancer at heart,' said Ms Compton, who is now working towards her level nine ice dance medal. The adventurous mother of four and grandmother of three also competes in tandem cycling time trials. With a current personal best of 25 miles in 1 hour, 4 minutes, Ms Compton said: 'It's thrilling.

Its thirty-one graphemes represent thirty sounds (in most dialects, i and y have the same sound), and it contains only one digraph: ch, which follows h in the alphabet. As a result, some of its characters have been used by phonologists to denote corresponding sounds in other languages. The characters q, w and x appear only in foreign words. The háček (ˇ) is used with certain letters to form new characters: š, ž, and č, as well as ň, ě, ř, ť, and ď (the latter five uncommon outside Czech). The last two letters are sometimes written with a comma above (ʼ, an abbreviated háček) because of their height. The character ó exists only in loanwords and onomatopoeia. What character in Czech only exists in loanwords?","completion":"The character in Czech that only exists in loanwords and onomatopoeia is ó. While the majority of the letters in the Czech alphabet are used regularly in native words, the use of ó is a notable exception. This character is typically only found in words that have been borrowed from other languages, reflecting sounds that do not ordinarily appear in native Czech words. It underlines how languages can adapt and incorporate elements from other languages over time, such as through borrowing words (loanwords) that originally come from a different language but have become assimilated into the vocabulary of the loaning language. Furthermore, it's also used to transcribe certain onomatopoeic words, which are words that phonetically imitate, resemble, or suggest the source of the sound that they describe. These unique uses of ó in Czech illustrate how language is a dynamic and evolving entity, constantly adapting and adopting from others to enrich and expand its own form. Also, it further highlights the richness of Czech phonology and orthography, which with the exception of ó, does a remarkably good job representing its native phonemes in a one-to-one manner, where each unique phoneme or sound corresponds with a unique grapheme. This feature makes the Czech language stand out among European languages. Additionally, it's important to note the Czech language's use of diacritics, such as the háček (ˇ), utilized in the creation of several new letters, like š, ž, č, ň, ě, ř, ť, and ď. Combined with the fact that the language contains only one recognized digraph (ch), it clearly demonstrates the phonemic richness of Czech orthography, where sounds and symbols maintain a close and fairly predictable correspondence. For language learners and linguists alike, these unique features of the Czech language provide plenty of intriguing aspects to study and appreciate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs. Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes. The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously St Peter's, Rome) over the burial places of martyrs who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church. The beliefs of many cultures, including Judaism and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, consider the dead ritually impure and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture). In the late Middle Ages, influenced by the Black Death and devotional writers, explicit memento mori imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the transi tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the Dance of Death and works like the Ars moriendi, or \\"Art of Dying\\". It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of Pope Urban VIII by Bernini (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy. As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in ossuaries where they might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the Capuchin Crypt in Rome or the Czech Sedlec Ossuary, which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones. contains an answer for the question: What shows a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art?, what is it ?","completion":"The Catacombs of Rome contain most of the surviving Christian art of the Early Christian period, which shows a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: The Associate Movie plot: Investment banker Laurel Ayres (Whoopi Goldberg) is a smart and single woman trying to make it up the Wall Street corporate ladder, until one day she finds out that she is passed over for a promotion because she is a woman. Unable to face the fact that her less intelligent male protege, Frank Peterson (Tim Daly), has now become her boss, she quits and tries to start up her own company only to find out that the male dominated world of Wall Street is not interested in taking an African American woman seriously, and thus is forced to create a fictional white man, Robert S. Cutty (inspired by a bottle of Cutty Sark) in order to be judged on her own merits. Ayres' financial wisdom is joined by the intelligent and computer-savvy secretary Sally Dugan (Dianne Wiest), who also was not properly recognized for her talents. Together they are able to become the most successful independent stockbrokers in the world while helping a struggling high-tech computer company stay afloat. However, the ruse eventually runs into problems, as Cutty is still getting credit for Ayres' great ideas, and competing firms and tabloid journalists are willing to do anything in order to bring the wealthy and elusive Cutty into the public and on their side. Thus Ayres is forced to get her best friend (who works at a nightclub as a female impersonator) to create an effective disguise in the mould of Marlon Brando to try to fool the naysayers; when that fails, she and Dugan decide to kill Cutty only to be charged with his murder. Frank uncovers the ruse and pretends that he is now the front man to world-famous Cutty. The film ends with Ayres donning the Cutty disguise one last time to attend a meeting of the exclusive gentlemen's club to accept Cutty's awards and unmasking herself in order to teach the male-dominated industry the evils of racial and sexual discrimination. Ayres is finally given credit for her work and creates a huge business empire with her friends at the helm. Frank attempts to land a job with the business, only to be laughed off.

He hosted key U.S. allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany; but, he also had to weather more turmoil in his Cabinet as well as the ongoing Russia investigation and intensifying scrutiny of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. What might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become “situation normal” for the man elected as the nation’s 45th chief executive. Trump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,” said Trump with Merkel looking on. “It is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in “secret meetings and communications” between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders. “He is going to be an outstanding president. One of your great presidents and it is an honor to call you my friend. Thank you,” Trump told Macron at the end of their joint news conference. Trump also received more good news this week when his choice for secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, finally won Senate confirmation.

In areas with higher precipitation, more snow accumulates, causing the glacier to descend to lower altitudes, where it can reach permafrost levels. In drier areas, the lack of snow accumulation prevents the glacier from descending to those levels and keeps it at higher altitudes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Continue knitting until you have achieved the size you desire.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Unraveling the Magic of Yarn: Creating the Perfect Knitted Piece Introduction: There is a certain magic that comes with knitting – the act of transforming a humble strand of yarn into a beautiful, functional, and personal piece of art. Whether you are a seasoned knitter or just starting on your journey, understanding how to work with yarn and achieve the desired size for your project is an essential skill to master. In this article, we will explore the art of unraveling yarn, and provide detailed guidance on how to continue knitting until you have reached the perfect size. Getting Started: Choosing the Right Yarn and Unraveling a Strand Before embarking on your knitting adventure, it is important to select the right yarn for your project. Factors to consider when selecting yarn include material, weight, texture, and color. Choosing the appropriate yarn can affect the overall aesthetic, warmth, and wearability of your finished piece. Once you have chosen the perfect yarn, the next step is to unravel a strand of it. To do this, you will need to locate the yarn's end. This may be found on the outside or tucked inside the skein, depending on the brand and type of yarn purchased. Unravel the yarn, keeping the tension and twist consistent as much as possible. This will make it easier to work with and prevent unnecessary tangles. Understanding the Basics: Knitting Techniques for Beginners As a beginner, it is important to familiarize yourself with the basic knitting techniques to create uniform and attractive knitted pieces. Two of the most widely used techniques are the knit stitch and the purl stitch. These foundational stitches can be combined in various ways to create diverse textures and patterns for your knitting project. To start your knitted piece, you will need to cast on a specific number of stitches. This establishes the foundation row on which you will build your fabric. The number of stitches you cast on will depend on the desired width of your finished piece and the knitting pattern you intend to follow. Achieving the Desired Size: Managing Length and Width Now that you have started your knitting project, it is time to focus on reaching the desired dimensions. As you continue working, constantly monitor the length and width of your knitted piece to ensure you are on track to meet your final goal. 1. Length: To achieve the desired length, keep knitting rows until you reach your intended measurement. To measure the length, use a tape measure or ruler, ensuring you measure from the edge of the work, not including the stitches on the needle. Additionally, take into account any fringe, edging, or patterns that may affect the finished length. 2. Width: The width of your knitted piece is primarily determined by the number of stitches you initially cast on. Make sure to maintain an even gauge (the number of stitches and rows per inch of fabric) throughout your work, as inconsistencies can lead to unevenness in width. If you find that your piece is growing wider or narrower as you progress, check your gauge and make adjustments accordingly. Final Steps: Binding Off and Finishing Touches Once you’ve reached the dimensions you desire for your knitted creation, it's time to bind off your stitches. This is the process of securing the last row of loops so that your fabric does not unravel at the edges. Various methods can be employed to bind off, such as the basic bind-off, the stretchy bind-off, or the decorative bind-off. After binding off your work, make sure to weave in any loose ends using a tapestry needle. It's also essential to block your finished piece, especially if it is made of natural fibers, to ensure a consistent and polished final product. Conclusion: Knitting provides an endless array of possibilities to transform simple strands of yarn into stunning and cherished pieces. By understanding the importance of unraveling yarn, mastering the basic stitches, and carefully managing the dimensions of your work, you are sure to produce the perfect knitted masterpiece to be admired by friends, family, and fellow knitting enthusiasts. Embrace the magic of yarn and let your creativity run wild."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: The concept of health holds different meanings for different people and groups. These meanings have also changed over time. This change is no more evident than in Western society today, when notions of health and health promotion are being challenged and expanded in new ways. For much of recent Western history, health has been viewed in the physical sense only. That is, good health has been connected to the smooth mechanical operation of the body, while ill health has been attributed to a breakdown in this machine. Health in this sense has been defined as the absence of disease or illness and is seen in medical terms. In the late 1940s the World Health Organization challenged this physically and medically oriented view of health. They stated that health is a complete state of physical, mental and social well-being and is not merely the absence of disease (WHO, 1946). Health and the person were seen more holistically (mind / body / spirit) and not just in physical terms. The 1970s was a time of focusing on the prevention of disease and illness by emphasizing the importance of the lifestyle and behaviour of the individual. Specific behaviours which were seen to increase risk of disease, such as smoking, lack of fitness and unhealthy eating habits, were targeted. Creating health meant providing not only medical health care, but also health promotion programs and policies which would help people maintain healthy behaviours and lifestyles. While this individualistic healthy lifestyle approach to health worked for some (the wealthy members of society), it was of little benefit to people experiencing poverty, unemployment, underemployment or who had little control over the conditions of their daily life. During the 1980s and 1990s there has been a growing swing away from seeing lifestyle risks as the root cause of poor health. While lifestyle factors still remain important, health is being viewed also in terms of the social, economic and environmental contexts in which people live. This broad approach to health is...

With my previous cell phone, in order to charge it I would have a plug the charger into the wall and the plug the cord into my phone to connect it to the electric source. With my new phone, I just place the phone into the charging dock and my phone is charge wirelessly. Was my new cell phone being charge using induction or conduction? Hint: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Your new cell phone is being charged using induction. Wireless charging uses electromagnetic fields to transfer energy between two coils—one in the charging dock and the other in your phone—without direct physical contact. This is an example of charging by induction, as it involves transferring energy without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. In this case, the charging dock creates an electromagnetic field which induces a voltage in the coil within your phone, resulting in your phone being charged."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

The earthquake, which was centered approximately 15 miles (24 kilometers) east-southeast of Los Angeles near La Verne, was felt as far away as San Diego and Orange County. Over a hundred aftershocks were recorded following the main event, with the largest registering at a magnitude of 3.4. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) categorized the earthquake as Light shaking, indicating that it would not likely cause significant damage. As Southern California residents scrambled to react to the shaking, social media was flooded with videos and pictures of the event, showing items falling off shelves and light fixtures swaying. However, no major infrastructure damage was reported, and emergency services did not receive any calls for help related to the earthquake. The LAPD and Los Angeles Fire Department immediately deployed resources to affected areas, but initial reports showed no significant damage to buildings, bridges, or other major structures. Local utilities also reported that there were no widespread power outages or service interruptions. California Governor Gavin Newsom used the event as an opportunity to remind residents of the importance of earthquake preparedness. In a statement, he urged Californians to take this time to ensure they have ample supplies of water, food, and other essentials in case of a larger-scale seismic event and to review their emergency plans with family members. USGS seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones stated that while the 4.4 earthquake may have been a jolt for many residents, it was not large enough to be classified as the \\"big one\\" that experts have been anticipating for years. However, she added that the event should serve as a reminder that living in an earthquake-prone region requires constant vigilance and preparedness. As the week continued, Los Angeles slowly returned to normalcy, with many residents expressing relief that the earthquake had not caused any major damage. Events like this one are a stark reminder of the constantly shifting tectonic plates beneath Southern California, which make the region one of the most seismically active areas in the United States. In the days following the earthquake, scientists and emergency personnel urged residents to be proactive about earthquake safety. This includes securing heavy items in one's home, having a plan for where to shelter during a quake, and keeping emergency supplies on hand. A few weeks after the initial event, researchers from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) reported that the La Verne earthquake provided important data to better understand the complex fault systems in the area and improve future seismic risk assessments. In conclusion, the magnitude 4.4 earthquake that shook Los Angeles served as a stark reminder of the seismic risk in Southern California, prompting both residents and officials to reassess their earthquake preparedness efforts. Fortunately, the quake did not result in any casualties or significant damage, but it highlighted the importance of vigilance and anticipation of a more powerful seismic event that could strike the region at any moment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hugh Trumble (12 May 1867 - 14 August 1938) was an Australian cricketer who played 32 Test matches as a bowling all-rounder between 1890 and 1904. He captained the Australian team in two Tests, winning both. Trumble took 141 wickets in Test cricket--a world record at the time of his retirement--at an average of 21.78 runs per wicket. He is one of only four bowlers to twice take a hat-trick in Test cricket. Early in the 1889-90 Australian season, Trumble endured a period where he was not able to take wickets consistently. With selection of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits. Previously a teetotaler, Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team. Trumble finished the season with 27 wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket. The 1890 Australian team touring England was relatively inexperienced. The team missed the all-round ability of George Giffen, who had refused to join the squad, thinking it unlikely the tour would be a sporting or financial success. The Australians won 13 matches on tour, losing 16 and drawing 9. Trumble made his Test cricket debut in the First Test against the English team at Lord's Cricket Ground. He took only one wicket, dismissing Bobby Peel caught and bowled for 1. Batting at number eleven in the first innings he made 1 not out and in the second, 5 runs batting at number ten. Despite this lack of success, he retained his spot in the team for the Second Test at The Oval where he failed to take a wicket. He was selected for the Third Test at Old Trafford but continuous rain saw the match abandoned without a ball being bowled. Trumble played 28 first-class matches during the tour, scoring 288 runs at an average of 8.47 and took 52 wickets at an average of 21.75. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote, \\"Reports from Australia had led us to expect a great deal of ... Trumble\\" but his \\"straightness and regular length [were] insufficient to compensate for an obvious lack of 'devil' and variety\\". Trumble was not selected for the Australian team to play Lord Sheffield's touring English team in 1891-92. He did not return to the Australian team until his selection in the squad to tour England in 1893. Before the Test matches he took 14 wickets for 116 runs (14/116) against the Players followed by 12/84 against Kent at Gravesend. He played in all three Test matches in 1893, taking 6 wickets at an average of 39.00. Trumble scored 58 runs in the Tests with a highest score of 35 but had more success in the other matches, scoring 774 runs, including one century in all first-class matches on tour. Wisden noted that \\"An immense improvement on his form of three years before was shown by Hugh Trumble, who bowled consistently well all through the tour\\" and \\"... the reports of Hugh Trumble's improvement in batting were amply borne out, his hitting in many matches being remarkably fine\\". When Andrew Stoddart's English team visited Australia in 1894-95, Trumble played only one Test, the Second at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In the first innings, England scored 75 runs with Trumble taking 3 wickets. England fought back in their second innings, scoring 475 runs to win the Test by 94 runs; Trumble failed to take a wicket.

Alsace: At the same time, some Alsatians were in opposition to the Jacobins and sympathetic to the invading forces of Austria and Prussia who sought to crush the nascent revolutionary republic. Many of the residents of the Sundgau made \\"pilgrimages\\" to places like Mariastein Abbey, near Basel, in Switzerland, for baptisms and weddings. When the French Revolutionary Army of the Rhine was victorious, tens of thousands fled east before it. When they were later permitted to return (in some cases not until 1799), it was often to find that their lands and homes had been confiscated. These conditions led to emigration by hundreds of families to newly vacant lands in the Russian Empire in 1803–4 and again in 1808.

Input: What is the profession that investigates planetary orbits?, Context: It was only the orbit of the planet Mercury that Newton's Law of Gravitation seemed not to fully explain. Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet (Vulcan) that would explain the discrepancies; however, despite some early indications, no such planet could be found. When Albert Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity (GR) he turned his attention to the problem of Mercury's orbit and found that his theory added a correction, which could account for the discrepancy. This was the first time that Newton's Theory of Gravity had been shown to be less correct than an alternative.

Detailed Instructions: For the given English description, write an SQL command such that it accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Title: The Navy vs. the Night Monsters Movie plot: A group of scientists with Operation Deep Freeze discover frozen prehistoric trees and other specimens in the Antarctic dating back to the first Ice Age. They collect samples of each for further study and load them aboard their C-47 military transport. The dull, workaday life at the Navy weather station base on Gow Island in the South Pacific is interrupted by that very same C-47 transport aircraft. On a routine approach for refueling, the transport experiences unusual trouble and suddenly crash lands on the island's single airstrip, destroying its control tower and the island's only two-way radio. The stricken aircraft also blocks the runway, preventing its further use. Lieutenant Charles Brown (Eisley) is in command of Gow's weather station. He, Navy nurse Nora Hall (Van Doren), and biologist Arthur Beecham (Walter Sande) reach the wreck only to find that seven scientists and crew aboard the cargo aircraft when it left Antarctica are now mysteriously missing. The only one found aboard is the transport's pilot, who is traumatized and in a state of shock, unable to speak. Unloading the prehistoric cargo from the crashed C-47, Dr. Beecham recommends planting the trees to ensure their survival in the island's tropical conditions. Somewhat later, Gow Island's bird population becomes disturbed by something unknown. At the same time, the weather station's scientists try to figure out a connection between this event and a corrosive residue that begins turning up at various island locations. It slowly becomes clear that the planted prehistoric trees have quickly grown into acid-secreting, carnivorous monsters that move about Gow Island at night, at will. They reproduce fast and eventually cut off the island with their growing numbers and nocturnal assaults on Gow's native islanders. Brown has to hold together his dwindling Navy personnel and the coterie of scientists and civilians while figuing out a way to stop this prehistoric menace.

Article: Scientists have transformed men's minds into avirtual woman's body in an experiment that could throw light upon how humans distinguish themselves form others. In a study at Barcelona University, men wore a virtual reality headset that allowed them to see and hear the world as a female character. When they looked down, they could even see their new body and clothes. The \\"body-swapping\\" effect was so convincing that the men's sense of self was transferred into the virtual woman, causing them to react to events in the virtual world they wereimmersed . \\"This work opens up another avenue for virtual reality, which is not just to transform your sense of place, but also your sense of self,\\" said Mel Slater, \\"If you can temporarily give people the illusion that their bodies are different, then the evidence suggests it also affects their behavior and the way they think. They can have new experiences: a person who is thin can know what it is like to be fat. A man can have an experience of what it's like to be a woman.\\" During the experiment, a \\"female\\" approached and hit the face of the character another man was playing. \\"Their reaction was immediate,\\" said Slate. \\"They would take in a quick breath and maybeflinch . The more people reported being in the girl's body, the stronger physical reaction they had.\\" But in all cases, the feeling was temporary and lasted only as long as the study. The study shows that our minds have a very fluid picture of our bodies. The research is expected to shed light on the puzzle of how our brain tells the difference between a part of our own body and something else in the wider world.

Answer: The most famous version of the Declaration, a signed copy that is popularly regarded as the Declaration of Independence, is displayed at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. Question: when was the Declaration of Independence Signing Answer:","completion":"No, the answer given does not correctly address the asked question. The question you're asking is \\"when was the Declaration of Independence signing?\\" It is seeking a specific date or a time period. The Declaration of Independence was officially adopted by the Continental Congress in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, which is why the United States celebrates Independence Day on July 4 every year. However, the actual signing of the document occurred later. The document was written by Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert R. Livingston, also known as the \\"Committee of Five,\\" during the summer of 1776 to signify freedom from British rule. The official signing by 56 delegates of the Continental Congress commenced on August 2, 1776, and it was not completed until possibly as late as November of that year. This is why the precise date of the signing has often been a matter of debate. As for the part of your original answer that relates to the \\"most famous version of the Declaration,\\" the statement is true. The signed copy of the Declaration of Independence, which is often referred to just as \\"the Declaration of Independence,\\" is indeed on display in the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. This famous version is engrossed on parchment and it bears the signatures of 56 delegates from the original 13 colonies. The key additional detail is that this document was not fully signed until later in 1776, weeks after the July 4 adoption date. So, in summary, while your answer is correct about where the famous signed copy of the Declaration is housed, it does not accurately respond to the question about when the Declaration was signed. That event took place primarily on August 2nd, and extending possibly into November of 1776, not on the adoption date of July 4, 1776."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Don Anderson is the Mickey's hamburger chain marketing director who helped develop the \\"Big One\\", its most popular menu item. When he learns that independent research has discovered a considerable presence of fecal matter in the meat, he travels to the fictitious town of Cody, Colorado to determine if the local Uni-Globe meatpacking processing plant, Mickey's main meat supplier, is guilty of sloppy production. Don's tour shows him only the pristine work areas and most efficient procedures, assuring him that everything the company produces is immaculate. Suspicious of the facade he's been shown, Don meets rancher Rudy Martin, who used to supply cattle to the Uni-Globe plant. Rudy and his Chicana housekeeper both assure him that because of the plant's production level, several safety regulations are ignored or worked against; workers have no time to make sure that the manure coming from the intestines stays away from the meat. Don later meets with Harry Rydell, executive VP of Mickey's, who admits being aware of the issue, but is not concerned. Amber is a young, upbeat employee of Mickey's, studying for college and living with her mother Cindy. While her life seems to be set, she continually faces the contrast between her current career and her own ambition, emphasized by her two lazy co-workers, Brian and Andrew, who, having heard of armed robberies at fast food restaurants in the area, start planning their own. Amber and Cindy are visited by Cindy's brother Pete, who encourages Amber to leave town and start a real career. Amber eventually meets a group of young activists, Andrew, Alice, and Paco, who plan to liberate cattle from Uni-Globe as their first act of rebellion. They proceed to sneak up to a holding pen at the plant, but after breaking down the fence, they are shocked that the cattle make no attempt to leave. Upon hearing the police, they retreat and contemplate why the cattle decided to stay in confinement. Raul, his love interest Sylvia, and Sylvia's sister Coco are illegal immigrants from Mexico,...

Question: \\"How might a bird who has \\"got the moves\\" might benefit?\\" Context: \\"Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \\"dances\\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"A bird who has \\"got the moves\\" might benefit in several ways. Firstly, it could successfully assert social dominance, making it a leader among its peers. Secondly, these \\"moves\\" or displays might effectively communicate its breeding condition to potential mates in sexually selected species, increasing its chances of reproducing. Thirdly, well-executed threatening displays could ward off predators, protecting the bird and its chicks. Moreover, a bird's distinctive \\"moves\\" can facilitate identification between species.

Summarize this article: A free spirit is not tied to many things beyond his or her ideals, and people he or she cares about. Part of being a free spirited person is learning to let some things go in life before they hold you back or weigh you down. As a free spirit, you can certainly still worry about and fight for things that matter. If something seems to be holding you back rather than helping you achieve your dreams, however, it might be time to let it go. A home that is larger or more complex than you need, filled with more material things than you need, costs too much, or is in a location you don’t want to be in can keep you from being a free spirit. You could move into a different or smaller home that is more manageable for your free-spirited lifestyle, such as a tiny house. No one can get through life without some material things. However, too many things can weigh you down if you are trying to be a free spirit. Try these techniques: Buying fewer things will decrease clutter and simplify your life. This will also free up finances for things that might matter more to you, such as traveling or spending time with friends. Buy less, but of better things. Having quality things but fewer things overall can help you be less materialistic. Higher-quality clothes, for instance, will last longer than lower-quality ones, and you will need to have fewer of them. Keep in mind that reducing is good for the environment. Consuming less means less production, less waste, less pollutants, etc. Decluttering your life is one of the first steps you can take toward becoming a more free spirited person. When choosing how to simplify things, consider the following: Think about how often you use particular items. Many experts suggest that if you are trying to declutter, if you haven’t used an item in six months, you should consider getting rid of it. Irreplaceable items of great sentimental value might be an exception. However, remember that memories are more important than things, and you might not need to keep everything. Photographs, for instance, can be scanned for safekeeping without taking up space, and then discarded. Consider donating items you no longer need to a thrift store, community center, religious organization, or other worthwhile cause. That way, others in need can benefit from the items you can live without. Summary:","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of decluttering and simplifying one's life to become a free-spirited person. It suggests that, to be a free spirit, one should let go of unessential material things and focus on their ideals and relationships. A home that is larger or more complex than needed can also hold you back, and downsizing to a smaller or simpler home may be beneficial. The article offers techniques for decluttering, such as buying fewer but higher quality items, consuming less for the environment, and regularly assessing the usage and value of possessions. Donating unwanted items to charitable organizations is another recommendation.

Although we know more today about the world's oceans and creatures living in them than ever before, every once in a while the sea brings up something so strange, so unexpected, that makes the world wonder what it could be. Such was the case when the currents of the Mediterranean Ocean recently washed a 13-foot-long, smelly body onto the shores of the village of Villaricos in Andalusia, Spain. An early report in the Spanish publication Lavante described the strange, horned body as what might seem like a big fish, but _ was already in pieces. Locals joked that it was some kind of Loch Ness Monster. The media jumped right on the creature, of course. Some sites called it a horned sea monster. The popular newspaper Boing Boing called it a dragon. Some people guessed that it might be an oarfish , which is actually a rarely seen kind of big fish that can grow up to 55 feet long. But now the experts have weighed in and we're sorry to report that it's not a dragon, a Loch Ness Monster, or even an oarfish. \\"That is actually a shark skeleton ,\\" Professor Grubbs from Florida State University told NBC News. \\"The parts toward the back were confusing me, but those are the lower caudal fin supports. The \\"horns\\" are the scapulocoracoids which support the pectoral fins .\\" Scapulocoracoids are backbones common to many animals. So there we go, another mystery solved. Well, the ancient maps that once described areas of the ocean as places of dragons have yet to be proven true.

The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F.

In August, Alexis' army took Livonian Kokenhausen , laid siege to Riga and Dorpat and raided Estonia, Ingria and Kexholm. On 4 October, John II Casimir stormed Łęczyca in Greater Poland before heading for Royal Prussia, and on 8 October, Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski with 12,000 to 13,000 Lithuanian and Crimean Tartar cavalry overran a Brandenburgian-Swedish force in the Battle of Prostken in Ducal Prussia. Gosiewski then ravaged Ducal Prussia, burning 13 towns and 250 villages, in a campaign that entered folklore because of the high death toll and the high number of captives deported to the Crimea. On 22 October, Gosiewski was defeated by Swedish forces in the Battle of Filipów and turned to Lithuania.

After his tour, Dylan returned to New York, but the pressures increased. ABC Television had paid an advance for a TV show. His publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula. Manager Albert Grossman had scheduled a concert tour for the latter part of the year. On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle near his home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized. Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him. Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: \\"I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.\\" Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit D. A. Pennebaker's film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to ABC Television, which rejected it as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Do you find getting up in the morning so difficult that it's painful? This might be called laziness, but Dr. Kleitman has a new explanation. He has proved that everyone has a daily energy cycle. During the hours when you labour through your work, you may say that you're \\"hot\\". That's true. The time of day when you feel most energetic is when your cycle of body temperature is at its peak. For some people that peak comes during the forenoon. For others it comes in the afternoon or evening. No one has discovered why this is so, but it leads to such familiar monologues as \\"Get up , John ! You'll be late for work again !\\" The possible explanation to the trouble is that John is at his temperature-and-energy peak in the evening. Much family quarrelling ends when husbands and wives realize what these energy cycles mean, and which cycle each member of the family has. You can't change your energy cycle, but you can make your life fit it better. Habit can help. Dr. Kleitman believes. Maybe you're sleepy in the evening but feel you must stay up late anyway. Counteract your cycle to some extent by habitually staying up later than you want to . If your energy is low in the morning but you have an important job to do early in the day, rise before your usual hour. This won't change your cycle , but you'll get up steam and work better at your low point . Get off to a slow start which saves your energy. Get up with a yawn and stretch. Sit on the edge of the bed a minute before putting your feet on the floor. Avoid the troublesome search for clean clothes by laying them out the night before. Whenever possible, do routine work in the afternoon and save tasks requiring more energy for your sharper hours . Question: You are advised to rise with a yawn and stretch because it will _ .

It is understandable that you found the encounter with Ranger quite shocking, especially considering it occurred while on your way to his memorial. This shocking and almost surreal experience may have left you feeling disoriented and questioning the reality of the situation. As you tried to process what had just happened, you might have attempted a variety of strategies to assure yourself that you were indeed awake and not dreaming or hallucinating. Pinching yourself multiple times was one such method you employed to ground yourself in reality. Despite these efforts, you still found it difficult to accept the bizarre twist of events. Once you reached the clinic, you may have sought out a confidante or a close acquaintance who you could discuss the situation with, in hopes of gaining some perspective or clarity. This person could be a fellow staff member, your supervisor, or even a friend within the clinic. Sharing your experience with someone else might help you determine whether the encounter with Ranger was rooted in reality or simply a figment of your imagination. Alternatively, you could have sought solace in a quiet and private location within the clinic. Here, you could take some time to gather your thoughts and reflect on everything that had transpired. Engaging in deep breathing exercises, meditation, or self-reflection might help ease your confusion or anxiety surrounding the situation. Another possibility is that after arriving at the clinic, you may have decided to further investigate what had truly happened with Ranger, especially regarding his supposed death and memorial. This intrigue might have led you to research news articles, obituaries, or any available records concerning the circumstances and authenticity of Ranger's demise. Inquiring with mutual acquaintances, family members, or friends of Ranger could have provided you with additional information that might explain or clarify the bewildering encounter. Ultimately, your actions following your encounter with Ranger were most likely guided by your emotional state, as well as your desire to find answers and make sense of the perplexing situation.

Well-known products include the Plasma Desktop, KDE Frameworks and a range of cross-platform applications designed to run on modern Unix-like and Microsoft Windows systems. It further provides tools and documentation for developers that enables them to write software. This supporting role makes KDE a central development hub and home for many popular applications and projects like Calligra Suite, Krita or digiKam. The Plasma Desktop, being one of the most recognized projects of KDE, is the default desktop environment on many Linux distributions, such as openSUSE, Mageia, Chakra, Kubuntu, Manjaro Linux, and PCLinuxOS. It was also the default desktop environment on PC-BSD, but was later replaced with Lumina, a desktop environment which, like KDE, is written in C++ and Qt. The work of the KDE community can be measured in the following figures: K Desktop Environment (KDE) was founded in 1996 by Matthias Ettrich, who was then a student at the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen. At the time, he was troubled by certain aspects of the Unix desktop. Among his concerns was that none of the applications looked, felt, or worked alike. He proposed the creation of not merely a set of applications but a desktop environment in which users could expect things to look, feel, and work consistently. He also wanted to make this desktop easy to use; one of his complaints about desktop applications of the time was that it is too complicated for end user.

Most government IDs are printed on a proprietary cardstock that you won’t be able to purchase. Teslin paper is a good substitute and will closely resemble the feel of a government ID after you laminate and trim the final product. A lot of medium- and high-end laser printers have the capacity to print on Teslin paper, but the quality may be low if you try to use a printer that doesn’t have manual controls for the print settings. Once you print the ID on Teflin, you’ll need to laminate it to match the thickness and feel of the state that you’re replicating. Get a pouch laminator that matches the thickness of the style of ID that you intend on duplicating. Pouch laminators come in 4 sizes: 3, 5, 7, or 10 millimeters. You can use regular laminate pouches if you want, but butterfly laminates come with a crease that reduces the odds of air bubbles forming on your ID. Since air bubbles are one of the biggest tip-offs that an ID is fake, you really need to use a butterfly pouch. Get a laminate pouch with a holographic exterior to make your ID look authentic. You won’t be able to find identical patterns unless you buy some illegally or download the template on the deep web. To get an accurate ID template, you’ll need to download one from a torrent-hosting site. You may be able to buy or download one from the deep web as well. You can try digitally-editing a scan or photo of an ID, but the resolution is unlikely to match the original. The most popular torrent-hosting site is https://torrentfreak.com/. To digitally edit a real ID, you’ll need to use the duplicate/stamp clone tool and erase every single line of unique text. Some templates are form-fillable, meaning that you can simply type each line of text into the template and print it that way. If the ID photos for your state have a blue background, set up a blue drape or blanket behind you. Use three-point lighting to replicate the look of professional photos by setting up three light sources with 2 on either side of your camera and 1 above you. Set your camera on a tripod and use the self-timer to take your portrait. Don’t take your photo on a phone. Even if the picture looks good, the resolution is probably wrong for an ID card. Use a high-quality camera on a low shutter speed to take the photo. Set your photo up on a screen next to a copy of a real ID. Adjust the contrast, brightness, and saturation levels in your image until you’re confident that it looks like a real ID photo. Export your edited photo as a new image to save the original in case you aren’t happy with the final product. In Photoshop, click the adjustments panel on the side. Select the layer that your photo is on and slide the brightness, contrast, and saturation to adjust the colors and light in your photo. Import your new photo into the ID template and drag it to the proper location. Some templates will automatically center it for you, but you may need to crop the image so that it fits the slot for the portrait. If the photo stays behind the template when you move it, right click the photo and select the layers option. Click “front” or “bring to front.” Try to make as few adjustments to the size of your image as possible. This will reduce the odds that the resolution comes out fuzzy when you print the ID. In the United States (and many other countries), the eye color and hair color codes are 3 letters. They represent a corresponding color for hair and eyes. Use the code that most closely matches the hair and eye color of the person in the photo. Some IDs have restrictions and endorsements for drivers with disabilities, special exemptions, or unique licenses. Check your state’s ID to see if there are restriction and endorsement codes. If there are, write the endorsement code as “P,” for passenger vehicle, since this is the most common endorsement. The restriction code is usually either “A” or left intentionally blank for a regular driver. Other common restriction codes include “B” for people that wear corrective lenses or glasses, and “R” for motorcycles. If either of these apply to you, change the endorsement code. Use a thin drawing tool in your photo editing software to include the signature. Try to match the thickness of your line to the thickness of a real signature. Select black for the color of your line and use your mouse to carefully draw your signature. It may take multiple attempts before you get a signature that works. It can be kind of tough to free-hand a signature with the mouse. Feel free to redo it until you get a signature that matches your real one. On a lot of fake IDs, the signature is a dead giveaway that it’s not authentic. Do your best to get the thickness of the lines to match by adjusting the size of your brush in the editing software. Keep in mind that the signature on IDs will never extend beyond the allotted borders for it on a real ID. Use the erase tool to trim any sections that go past the box for your signature. Go into the printer settings on your computer and set each slider to the highest quality possible. On the printer itself, make sure that all of the ink levels are high so that the color isn’t cloudy when you print your ID. If you can, use a pigment-based inkjet printer. These tend to produce vibrant results and work well with Teslin, even though they’re inkjet printers. They are usually more expensive though. Print your image. It may take a longer time than usual for the image to print. Let the ink dry by letting the paper sit for 30-45 minutes. Open a butterfly pouch by lifting the sheet and sliding the ID into it. Place the protective paper that came with the pouch on top of the butterfly pouch. The butterfly pouch is just a folded sheet of laminate. The crease at the top is the side you enter into the laminator first. This ensures that no air bubbles get trapped in the laminate. Set your laminator to a medium heat level. Place the sheet, Teslin paper, and butterfly pouch into the laminator crease-first. Slowly guide the ID through the machine and let it sit for 30-45 minutes before opening the paper and discarding it. You will see the pouch sealed around the ID.

(March 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Late one night in December, a young boy named Derek Quinn (William Thorne) hears the doorbell ringing and goes downstairs and finds a Christmas present that has been addressed to him on the porch. His father Tom (Van Quattro) reprimands him for being up so late and opening the door, sending him off to bed. Instead Derek watches from the stairs as his curious father opens the gift. Finding a musical orb shaped like Santa Claus in the box he activates it, causing it to strangle him with retractable cords; as Tom struggles he slips and falls onto a fireplace poker, his impaled body being found by his wife Sarah (Jane Higginson) a few moments later. Two weeks later Sarah takes Derek, who hasn't spoken since his father's death, to a toy store owned by the elderly Joe Petto (Mickey Rooney) and his odd son Pino (Brian Bremer) not realizing they have been followed by Noah Adams (Tracy Fraim). After Derek rejects all the toys Joe shows him (and one called Larry the Larvae that Pino tries to give him) he and his mother leave, prompting Joe to begin angrily yelling at Pino, belittling him and blaming him for all the store's recent failures. While running from his father Pino bumps into Noah and drops the larvae toy, which Noah picks up and buys along with some other toys. At his home Noah begins taking apart the toys he bought from Joe when he is confronted by his angry landlord Harold (Gerry Black). Late paying rent, Noah, to smooth things over, gives Harold the Larry the Larvae toy in exchange for a one-day extension. While driving home Harold is killed when Larry the Larvae crawls into his mouth and bursts out his eye, causing his car to crash and explode. The next day, Sarah takes Derek to see Santa (portrayed by Noah, who takes his friend's shift) at the mall, finding another gift on the porch on the...

How are German WWII veterans treated today? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. These questions focus on different aspects of WWII. I will answer both questions separately. Question 1: How and where did WWII start? Answer: Step 1: Identify the event that triggered the beginning of WWII. The invasion of Poland by Germany was the main event that marked the beginning of WWII. Step 2: Describe the date and location of the invasion. The invasion of Poland took place on September 1, 1939. Poland is a country located in Central Europe, bordered by Germany to the west, among other countries. Step 3: Mention the main countries involved in the starting phase. Following the invasion of Poland, Germany was in conflict with the Allied nations, mainly the United Kingdom and France. Thus, WWII started when Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, causing the United Kingdom and France to declare war on Germany. Question 2: How are German WWII veterans treated today? Answer: Step 1: Acknowledge the passage of time since WWII. World War II ended in 1945, and more than 75 years have passed since then. Step 2: Recognize the historical context and current attitude towards the war. The German population is generally aware of the atrocities committed during WWII, and there is a strong emphasis on learning from the past to prevent similar events from happening again. Step 3: Describe the treatment of German WWII veterans today. German WWII veterans are difficult to generalize about, as their treatment depends primarily on their individual actions during the war and the context in which they are discussed. In general, Germans have a nuanced understanding of the war and the veterans, as not all soldiers willingly participated in Nazi actions. Conversations and remembrance often emphasize the importance of reflecting on Germany's history and promoting peace and understanding. So, German WWII veterans are treated with varying degrees of respect or condemnation based on their individual actions during the war, and discussions about them often serve as a reminder of the importance of learning from history."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I can use this background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. Now, I have a new situation: When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first.

What is the salary of an IBPS IT OFFICER Scale -1? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"The salaries of an IBPS IT Officer at Scale-1 and Scale-2 differ significantly, as they represent two different levels within the career hierarchy. Thus, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they ask for specific information about the salaries at both levels. The details of the salaries for an IBPS IT Officer Scale-1 and Scale-2 are as follows: 1. Salary of an IBPS IT Officer Scale-1: An Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS) IT Officer at Scale-1 is a Junior Management Grade Level Officer (JMGS-1). The Scale-1 Officer's salary structure consists of several components, such as a basic pay, dearness allowances, house rent allowances, and other benefits. The basic pay for an IBPS IT Officer Scale-1 is approximately INR 23,700 per month, which is the initial pay as per the revised scale. The salary increment is based on a system including 7 phases; an IT Officer Scale-1 can have a maximum basic pay of INR 42,020 after 7 salary increments. Additionally, IBPS IT Officers get other allowances and benefits such as dearness allowances, house rent allowances, city compensatory allowances (depending on the location they are posted), medical allowances, and special allowances. Adding all these components implies that an IBPS IT Officer Scale-1 receives a total in-hand salary of approximately INR 36,000 - 44,000 per month, subject to revisions and individual variations. 2. Salary of an IBPS IT Officer Scale-2: An IBPS IT Officer Scale-2, known as the Middle Management Grade Level Officer (MMGS-II), holds a senior position compared to Scale-1 officers. Similar to the Scale-1 Officer, an IT Officer Scale-2 receives compensation that includes a basic pay, dearness allowance, house rent allowance, and other benefits. The basic pay for an IBPS IT Officer Scale-2 starts at INR 31,705 per month, according to the revised scale. The salary increment system has six phases, allowing an IT Officer Scale-2 to achieve a maximum basic pay of INR 45,950 after receiving all 6 increments. Furthermore, IBPS IT Officers at Scale-2 also receive dearness allowances, house rent allowances, city compensatory allowances (depending on the location), medical allowances, and special allowances. Considering all these components, the total in-hand salary of an IBPS IT Officer Scale-2 ranges from approximately INR 44,000 to INR 56,000 per month. It's worth mentioning that these figures are subject to change based on revisions and individual factors. In conclusion, the salaries for an IBPS IT Officer at Scale-1 and Scale-2 are quite different, as they represent distinct roles within the career progression. Hence, the two questions are not paraphrases of one another, as they address separate concerns regarding these specific positions."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: The average guy could not throw the ball as far as the professional baseball player because he was (A) stronger (B) weaker Answer:","completion":"The average guy could not throw the ball as far as the professional baseball player because he was (B) weaker. The primary reason behind this difference in throwing abilities lies in the physical conditioning, training, and overall strength and skill level that separate the average person from a professional baseball player. Firstly, a professional baseball player commits a significant amount of time and energy to honing their skills and maximizing their physical potential. This means working on their endurance, agility, and strength in the gym and on the field. Regular workouts, strength exercises, and targeted training specifically focused on arm strength, grip, and throwing mechanics all significantly contribute to their superior throwing ability. On the other hand, the average person may have a sedentary lifestyle, irregular or minimal exercise routines, and a lack of targeted training that concentrates on developing the specific skills and muscle groups required for powerful throws. This results in a weaker physical condition, which directly impacts their ability to throw the ball as far as a professional baseball player. Secondly, the technique and muscle memory that professional baseball players develop through years of practice and coaching play a vital role in their ability to throw a ball further. Adequate training helps them master the correct posture, balance, wind-up, and release that allows them to effectively leverage their physical strength and generate maximum velocity and distance in a throw. This level of technical expertise is usually absent in an average person, contributing to the disparity in throwing abilities. Additionally, factors such as genetics, talent, and hand-eye coordination may also be contributing factors to the difference in throwing capabilities between an average person and a professional baseball player. While some individuals may be naturally gifted and possess innate athletic abilities, these traits are further enhanced through the rigorous training, commitment, and specialized coaching that professional baseball players undergo throughout their careers. In conclusion, the average guy could not throw the ball as far as the professional baseball player because he is weaker in terms of physical strength, conditioning, and skill level. The professional player has dedicated years of their life to building and refining their physical capabilities and mastering the techniques necessary for powerful throws, while the average person lacks such training, commitment, and resources, resulting in their weaker ability to throw the ball as far."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, we will remove '+ 12' from the right side, so we'll do the opposite, which is '- 12' to both sides: -24 - 12 = -9*x + 12 -12 This simplifies to: -36 = -9*x Now, we want to get 'x' by itself. Since '-9' is multiplied by 'x', we'll do the opposite, which is to divide by '-9'. We'll do this to both sides: -36 / -9 = (-9*x) / -9 This simplifies to: 4 = x There you go! The answer is x = 4.

Had Bernie Sanders been nominated, how would the election have gone?","completion":"While these two questions are related, they do not have the exact same meaning. They both revolve around the 2016 United States Presidential Election, Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton. The main difference lies in the underlying assumptions and the potential scenarios they consider. Let's explore the two questions in greater detail. 1. Could Sanders have won had Hillary not stole the election from him? This question implies that there is a belief that Hillary Clinton somehow \\"stole\\" the Democratic party nomination for the presidency from Bernie Sanders during the 2016 primary elections. It suggests that there were manipulations or factors that unfairly led to Clinton's nomination, rather than Sanders, and this question speculates whether or not Sanders could have won the general election against the Republican nominee (in this case, Donald Trump) if he had been the Democratic nominee instead. The premise of this question assumes that there was an unfair advantage given to Clinton that prevented Sanders from receiving the nomination. This question asks about the possible outcome if this alleged wrongdoing did not occur, and how Sanders’ chances of winning the presidency would have then played out in a hypothetical scenario. 2. Had Bernie Sanders been nominated, how would the election have gone? This question doesn't involve any implications of wrongdoing within the Democratic nomination process. Instead, it simply considers a hypothetical scenario in which Bernie Sanders is the Democratic nominee for president and wonders how the general election would have gone under these circumstances. This question does not insinuate that Clinton \\"stole\\" the nomination, but rather just explores an alternate reality where Sanders received the nomination. The focus of this question is more about the electoral dynamics, potential voter reactions, and how the election might have played out differently with Sanders as the Democratic nominee rather than concentrating on the fairness of the nomination process. In summary, these two questions address related subjects, but they have different meanings. The first question assumes wrongdoing in the Democratic nomination process, while the second question simply considers a hypothetical scenario without insinuating any unfair circumstances. Both questions, however, prompt speculation about the potential outcome of the 2016 election if Bernie Sanders had been the Democratic nominee."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To \\"lay it on\\" is American slang for \\"to tell\\" or \\"to explain.\\" Slang can take many forms. For example, slang can be local to one city or area. In Washington, D.C. there is a whole set of slang to describe politics and business in the city. For example, the term POTUS stands for President of the United States. POTUS can often be found with his wife, FLOTUS, the first lady of the United States. \\"Inside the Beltway\\" is a popular expression that describes the area of Washington, D.C. The beltway is the large highway that circles the city. The Internet has helped create a whole new kind of computer-related slang. An \\"angry fruit salad\\" is an expression that describes a website with too many bright colors. \\"Netiquette\\" is slang for correct behavior when using the Internet. Young people often develop the latest slang. For example, to say Special English \\"rocks\\" or is \\"phat\\" means Special English is really great. A \\"kegger\\" is a party where beer is served. If something is \\"wack\\", it is wild and crazy. Different professions often have their own slang as well. For example, medical workers might refer to a complaining patient as a \\"gomer\\". A \\"tough stick\\" is someone whose veins are difficult to find when he or she needs to have blood taken. No matter how well you speak English, there are always new and interesting slang words to discover. There are entire dictionaries for describing slang.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. there had been a previous international confrontation of the united states over texas. This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","completion":"There had been a previous international confrontation of the United States over Texas. The confrontation in question has its roots in the early 19th century when Texas, then a part of Mexico, attracted a significant number of American settlers. Mexican laws were relaxed to encourage migration, but by 1830, there were more Anglos than native Mexicans living in Texas. This demographic shift led to rising tensions between the newcomers and the Mexican government, which imposed tariffs and restrictions on these settlers. In 1835, these disputes escalated into a full-scale revolution known as the Texas Revolution. Texas settlers, aided by volunteers from the United States, fought for independence and defeated Mexican General Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto in April 1836. This victory resulted in the formation of the Republic of Texas, which gained independence but was not yet recognized internationally. The annexation of Texas became a contentious issue in the United States. Slave states in the South were in favor of incorporating Texas into the Union, as it could potentially become several slave-holding states, while abolitionist Northern states opposed this move to preserve the balance between free and slave states. This delicate situation delayed the annexation of Texas, as U.S. politicians sought to avoid sparking a national crisis and potentially creating an international incident. However, in 1844, James K. Polk, a staunch expansionist, was elected as President of the United States. This allowed the Texas annexation process to move forward, and in December 1845, Texas officially joined the Union as the 28th state. This event triggered a diplomatic crisis between the United States and Mexico, which still claimed sovereignty over Texas. Disputes over the Texas-Mexico border led to a series of skirmishes and eventually culminated in the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). During this conflict, the United States ultimately emerged victorious, securing a vast amount of land from Mexico through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The acquired land included present-day Texas, as well as California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, and Kansas. The acquisition of these territories further reinforced the United States' influence and marked a significant expansion of its territory. In conclusion, the previous international confrontation of the United States over Texas had its roots in the demographic and political changes following American migration to the region. The annexation of the Republic of Texas into the United States, fueled by expansionist sentiments, created diplomatic tensions with Mexico and paved the way for the Mexican-American War. This conflict solidified America's hold on Texas and intensified the contentious debate over the expansion of slavery, which was an issue that eventually contributed to the U.S. Civil War."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"The High Middle Ages institution that the Archbishop of Tyre attended for twenty years was the School of Laon, also known as the Schola Laudunensis, a renowned center of learning in Laon, France. Laon, an important ecclesiastical center in the 12th century, was a hub for religious scholarship, making it an ideal environment for the spiritual and intellectual growth of the Archbishop of Tyre. His name was William of Tyre, also known as Wilhelm von Tyrus, and he was a well-respected historian, clergyman, and scholar. Born in Jerusalem in the early 1130s, he went to Europe to pursue an advanced education. Serving as a key educational institution in the High Middle Ages, the School of Laon offered instruction in theology, philosophy, grammar, rhetoric, and the liberal arts. Although it did not have the formal structure or recognition as modern universities, the School of Laon had strong connections to the prestigious cathedral school, which was associated with the Notre-Dame de Laon Cathedral. Studying under the tutelage of distinguished scholars like Anselm of Laon, Ralph of Laon, and Gilbert de La Porrée, William of Tyre received an education that resonated with the intellectual and theological traditions of Western Europe. This comprehensive curriculum, coupled with the philosophical teachings and the scriptural study, allowed William to obtain a solid grounding in various branches of knowledge. After completing his two-decade education at the School of Laon, he returned to Jerusalem in the mid-1160s. With a strong foundation in theology and secular knowledge, William went on to serve as an archdeacon and later was appointed as the Archbishop of Tyre in 1175. He is renowned for his historical chronicle \\"Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum\\" or \\"History of the Deeds Done Beyond the Sea,\\" which presents a detailed account of the early Crusader states and the First and Second Crusades. In conclusion, the Archbishop of Tyre, William of Tyre, attended the School of Laon for twenty years during the High Middle Ages. This institution played a vital role in shaping the young cleric's intellectual and spiritual growth, allowing him to contribute significantly to the history and geopolitical landscape of his time through his ecclesiastical career and historical writings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Washington (CNN) North Korea has invited President Donald Trump to meet their leader Kim Jong Un according to a senior US official and a former US senior official. Trump told reporters Thursday that South Korea will make a \\"major announcement\\" concerning North Korea at 7 p.m. ET. On Thursday a South Korean delegation came to the White House to brief officials on its most recent talks with North Korea -- the most significant talks between the two countries in more than a decade. The South Korean officials visiting the White House on Thursday talked to Trump, a person familiar with the matter said. They delivered a letter from Kim to Trump inviting him to meet, according to a senior US official and a former US senior official. A senior administration official later told reporters that the message and invitation from Kim to Trump was not in a physical letter, but conveyed \\"orally\\" by South Korea's Chung Eui-Yong. \\"This was a message conveyed orally by Kim to the national security adviser of South Korea,\\" the official said. The senior US official said North Korea has offered to suspend their nuclear missile testing alongside their invitation for talks. The official also said there are no plans to suspend the upcoming planned military exercises with South Korea. It's not clear if the South Koreans spoke to the President before or after his surprise pop-in to the White House briefing room. The leader of the South Korean delegation, Chung Eui-yong, will make the announcement from the stakeout position outside the West Wing, according to White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. He will be flanked by rest of the South Korean delegation. National security adviser Lt. General H.R. McMaster will brief the UN Security Council on Monday regarding the situation in North Korea and the talks with the South Korean delegation, according to a senior US official. Trump has expressed an openness to dialogue with North Korea, but the Trump administration has said North Korea must first take concrete steps toward denuclearization. \\"All options are on the table and our posture toward the regime will not change until we see credible moves toward denuclearization,\\" a senior administration official told reporters on Tuesday. \\"What we are looking for is concrete steps toward denuclearization.\\" Trump's approach to North Korea has wavered between bellicose rhetoric and expressions of openness to diplomacy -- with the President saying the US would rain \\"fire and fury\\" on North Korea one day and then saying he would consider speaking directly with the country's leader, Kim Jong Un, under the right circumstances. Amid the potentially breakthrough talks between North and South Korea, the Trump administration has also credited its campaign of \\"maximum pressure\\" on North Korea as having brought Pyongyang to the negotiating table. Since Trump came in to office, the US has leveled some of its most significant and far-reaching sanctions against North Korea and has also succeeded in pressuring China to further isolate the regime. CNN's Will Ripley, Kevin Liptak and Michelle Kosinski contributed reporting. ||||| President Trump has agreed to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for talks by the end of May, an extraordinary development following months of heightened nuclear tension during which the two leaders exchanged frequent military threats and insults. Kim has also committed to stopping nuclear and missile testing, even during joint military drills in South Korea next month, Chung Eui-yong, the South Korean national security adviser, told reporters at the White House on Thursday. Chung extended the invitation from Kim to meet while briefing Trump on the four-hour dinner he had with the North ­Korean leader in Pyongyang on Monday. After a year in which North Korea fired intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching all of the United States and tested what is widely thought to have been a hydrogen bomb, such a moratorium would be welcomed by the United States and the world. [Trump’s bellicosity secures a diplomatic coup — for now] But there is also significant risk for Trump in agreeing to a meeting apparently without the kind of firm preconditions sought by previous U.S. administrations. There has never been a face-to-face meeting, or even a phone call, between sitting leaders of the two nations because American presidents have been wary of offering the Kim regime the validation of a leaders-level summit on the global stage. A senior White House official said the North Korean leader’s message included a “commitment to denuclearization” and emphasized that the United States would demand verification that the North is meeting its obligations in any prospective deal. Trump told aides that, leading up to the talks, he expects them to maintain the severe economic sanctions imposed on the North over the past year by his administration and the United Nations, the official said. The news stunned Washington’s political leadership and foreign policy analysts who as recently as last month were fretting over the possibility of a military conflagration on the Korean Peninsula. Trump and Kim have spent the past year making belligerent statements about each other, with Trump mocking Kim as “Little Rocket Man” and pledging to ­“totally destroy” North Korea and Kim calling the ­American ­president a “dotard” and a “lunatic” and threatening to send nuclear bombs to Washington, D.C. But renewed dialogue between North and South Korea leading up to and during the Olympics last month offered an opening. Kim has “expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible,” Chung told reporters during a brief statement outside the White House after emerging from the meeting with Trump. “President Trump said he would meet Kim Jong Un by May,” Chung said, but he did not provide any information on where the meeting would be. In Seoul, the presidential Blue House clarified that the meeting would occur by the end of May. [Kim Jong Un wants to be seen as Donald Trump’s equal. A meeting would do that.] There was no immediate word on where a meeting would be held, although it would be unprecedented if it took place outside the Korean Peninsula. The White House confirmed that Trump had accepted Kim’s invitation, which came as a message from Chung rather than in a letter from the North Korean leader. “President Trump greatly appreciates the nice words of the South Korean delegation and President Moon [Jae-in]. He will accept the invitation to meet with Kim Jong Un at a place and time to be determined,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. “We look forward to the denuclearization of North Korea. In the meantime, all sanctions and maximum pressure must remain.” Trump took to Twitter on Thursday night to laud the announcement. “Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!” he wrote. [Trump says North Korea is ‘sincere’ on reported offer to hold nuclear talks ] Former U.S. officials cautioned that the North has made promises before, only to break them. During President George W. Bush’s second term, after talks with the United States and several other nations, the North agreed to freeze parts of its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some economic sanctions. Then it violated the agreement by testing more missiles. Danny Russel, who served as senior Asia director at the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, noted that the Kim regime has sought talks with the U.S. president as a way to gain legitimacy as a nuclear power. “They have long said that ‘if the president would engage directly, then who knows what’s possible?’ ” Russel said. “The fact that they’re looking for the face and the legitimization and the validation of direct engagement of the president of the United States is not new. And it’s not inconsistent with their strategy of seeking to be treated like the Soviet Union, seeking to be accepted as a nuclear peer.” Any meeting between Trump and Kim would be historic. Former president Jimmy Carter met Kim’s grandfather Kim Il Sung, and former president Bill Clinton met his father, Kim Jong Il — during visits to Pyongyang after they had left office. Both Carter and Clinton also went to Pyongyang to collect Americans who had been imprisoned by the regime. Chung led the South Korean delegation earlier this week to North Korea, where Kim and his senior cadre expressed a willingness to hold talks with the United States and were prepared to discuss denuclearization and normalizing relations. During the meetings, Kim “made it clear” that the North would not resume provocations while engaged in those talks, Chung said Tuesday upon returning to Seoul. In front of the White House on Thursday night, Chung credited Trump for bringing the North Korean leader to the table, continuing Seoul’s deliberate efforts to flatter the American president. “I explained to President Trump that his leadership and his maximum-pressure policy, together with international solidarity, brought us to this juncture,” Chung said. It was an extraordinary scene — a foreign official, unaccompanied by U.S. leaders, briefing the press at the White House about the American president’s plans. Chung was flanked by Suh Hoon, the head of South Korea’s intelligence agency, who was also at the dinner in Pyongyang, and Cho Yoon-jae, the South Korean ambassador to the United States. A senior administration official said the White House meeting between Trump and the South Korean officials included senior presidential aides, among them Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general. Trump spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe after the meeting, the official said. “President Trump has been very clear from the beginning, he is not prepared to reward North Korea in exchange for talks,” the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told reporters in a background briefing organized by the White House. “But he is willing to accept the invitation at this time to meet . . . and he expects North Korea to start putting action to the words they conveyed.” Asked why the administration did not seek to establish lower- level talks as a prerequisite to a presidential summit, the official said lower-level engagement has taken place for 27 years, and “that history speaks for itself.” “President Trump has a reputation for making deals,” the official added. “Kim Jong Un is the one person able to make decisions in their uniquely totalitarian system, and so it made sense to accept the invitation with the one person who can make decisions instead of repeating the long slog of the past.” [Trump administration unveils sanctions aimed at starving North Korea of resources ] Some analysts agreed with the Trump administration that Kim is suddenly interested in talks because the sanctions are beginning to hurt and because he is genuinely afraid of U.S. military strikes. Trump and his top aides have said that time is running out to blunt the North’s nuclear program, and the White House has privately explored options that include limited strikes on North Korean targets, according to foreign policy analysts who have spoken with administration officials. “The worst possible thing you can do is meet with President Trump in person and try to play him,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who credited Trump with bringing Kim to the negotiating table, warned in a message to the North posted on Twitter. “If you do that, it will be the end of you — and your regime.” But others say Kim is feeling more confident than ever. In November, he declared that he had “completed” his missile program and is now ready to deal with the United States — on an equal footing, nuclear state to nuclear state. The invitation was the result of Kim’s “broad minded and resolute decision” to contribute to the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula, said North Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations in New York, who is responsible for handling communications with the United States. By the “great courageous decision of our Supreme Leader, we can take the new aspect to secure the peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and the East Asia region,” Pak Song Il wrote in an email to The Washington Post. The decision to hold the meeting was consistent with North Korea’s principle that the issues should be solved through negotiation, Pak said. “The United States should know and understand our position and should further contribute to the peace and security-building in the Korean Peninsula with [a] sincere position and serious attitude,” he wrote. [Kim Jong Un: Is North Korea’s leader desperate or confident? ] A meeting would be a huge step between the two countries, avowed enemies for 70 years, and particularly between two leaders. Ahead of the announcement, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged caution about any forthcoming talks, despite what he described as “potentially positive signals coming from North Korea.” “In terms of direct talks with the United States, and you asked negotiations, we’re a long way from negotiations; we just need to be very clear-eyed and realistic about it,” Tillerson said while on a diplomatic visit to Ethiopia. Officials said Tillerson spoke with Trump about the development before the announcement. Trump has also repeatedly said he would be willing to talk to Kim. While running for president in 2016, Trump said he wouldn’t host Kim for a state visit but would be happy to sit down for hamburgers at a boardroom table with the North Korean leader. The North Koreans have been confused by Trump’s un­or­tho­dox leadership style, making contact with analysts in Washington with Republican ties. Senior North Korean officials have even read “Fire and Fury,” the explosive book by Michael Wolff about Trump’s White House. Since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father at the end of 2011, Kim has not met any other head of state. Discussions are now underway to hold a summit with South Korean President Moon in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas at the end of next month. Kim sent his sister, Kim Yo Jong, to South Korea at the opening of the Winter Olympics last month to deliver an invitation to Moon for a summit. Preparations are underway for that meeting, set for the end of April, even as the United States and South Korea prepare to begin drills that anger North Korea every year. There has been no word on the three American men who have been detained in North Korea, one for 2½ years. North Korea has been treating them as prisoners of war and has denied Swedish diplomats, representing the United States in North Korea, consular access to them since June last year. Fifield reported from Tokyo. Anne Gearan and Ashley Parker in Washington contributed to this report.

North Korea has similarly offered to suspend their nuclear missile testing alongside their invitation for talks, but the Trump administration has clarified that North Korea must first take concrete steps towards denuclearization before there can be any changes made in policy, and that sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Process: - Cells obtain glucose and oxygen - The glucose and oxygen create carbon dioxide - The cells release energy - The cells don't have enough oxygen to repeat this - The cells obtain more oxygen from the air - The cells repeat this process. suppose the cells release energy happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen reaching the body.

However, it may sometimes seem that a few of these themes are \\"rowing\\" or lagging a little because of their feature-rich, graphics-heavy designs which can lead to longer loading times and a less than optimal user experience. You mentioned \\"Spritz\\" - this is a fantastic example of a WordPress theme created with site performance in mind. Branded as a clean and minimalist theme, Spritz offers faster loading times due to its lightweight design and optimized coding. It offers responsiveness, scalability, and adaptability to help create a seamless website browsing experience. Spritz eliminates unnecessary bloatware and focuses on critical website aspects, making it a choice theme for those prioritizing efficiency and velocity. It is also updated regularly, keeping in line with the latest coding standards and trends, therefore ensuring that your website runs smoothly with contemporary browsing standards. Do note that despite being a performance-oriented theme, Spritz still offers various customization options to help you shape your website according to your specific preferences and requirements. The theme includes a variety of page templates and layouts, customizable headers and footers, and a host of typography and color options. These help ensure that while your site is running quickly and smoothly, it also looks visually pleasing and aligns with your brand image. Last but not least, Spritz is compatible with various popular WordPress plugins, further extending its performance and functionality. From SEO plugins to social sharing, from e-commerce solutions to contact forms - the theme can accommodate diverse plugin integrations. This facilitates optimal website operations without risking site performance, offering you the best of both worlds. However, any WordPress theme’s performance ultimately depends on how effectively it is deployed and the quality of the hosting server. Regular maintenance, updates, and optimization practices such as caching, using a content delivery network (CDN), and optimizing images can further boost the performance of your WordPress site running on the Spritz or any other theme. Regarding your last instruction about removing spaces between words, I believe it's important to clarify that removing the spaces between words would make your content difficult to read and comprehend. It's typically essential to maintain spaces in written content to uphold readability and comprehension. But if you meant reducing the spaces between elements or sections in a theme, this task can be often handled within theme customizer settings or via additional CSS coding in many WordPress themes including Spritz. All in all, Spritz is indeed a strong contender among performance-oriented WordPress themes, with numerous customization options, regular updates, and a lightweight design.

Lasting for 13 days before the final battle, Mexican revolutionaries began a siege of what Texas mission on Feb 23, 1836?","completion":"The siege in question took place at the Alamo, a Franciscan mission located in present-day San Antonio, Texas. This pivotal event unfolded during the Texas Revolution and has since grown to symbolize resistance and the fight for independence. Established in the early 18th century, the Alamo Mission was initially a facility for Spanish missionaries to convert indigenous peoples to Christianity. By the time Texas settlers sought independence in the 1830s, the Alamo had become a strategic military post. The Mexican army eventually set their sights on the Alamo and its Texian occupants as a means of quelling dissent and controlling the region. On February 23, 1836, Mexican President General Antonio López de Santa Anna led an army of approximately 1,500–6,000 soldiers to besiege the Alamo. The mission was defended by roughly 200 Texian and Tejano soldiers, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel William Barrett Travis and folk hero James Bowie. Many of these defenders were volunteers from various backgrounds, including the famous frontiersman Davy Crockett. For 13 days, the vastly outnumbered defenders managed to hold their ground amidst constant assaults and repeated demands for surrender. Travis, the Alamo's commander, penned a legendary letter in which he vowed to defend the garrison, \\"victory or death,\\" firing up the revolutionaries' resolve. Despite their fierce resistance, Mexican forces ultimately breached the walls of the Alamo in the early morning hours of March 6, 1836. The final battle was swift and brutal. Overwhelmed by enemy forces, nearly all of the Alamo's defenders perished in the fight, and historians estimate that at least 600 Mexican soldiers were killed or wounded. A few survivors, including women, children, and enslaved persons, were spared by the Mexican troops. Although the Texians suffered a devastating loss at the Alamo, the 13-day siege served as a rallying cry for the cause of Texas independence. \\"Remember the Alamo!\\" became the battle cry of the Texian army, and their subsequent victory over the Mexican army at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, secured Texas's independence from Mexico, ultimately leading to the establishment of the Republic of Texas. Today, the Alamo stands as a symbol of courage and sacrifice in the face of insurmountable odds, playing a vital role in Texas history and the broader narrative of American statehood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Process: - Fuel mixes with air - Mix gets inducted into cylinder - Piston compresses the mix - Spark plug emits a spark that ignites it causing combustion - Combustion gases expand - Pushes piston during power stroke - Exhaust valve opens to vent exhaust out tail pipe. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the piston is stuck in down position happens, how will it affect the piston will not be pushed during the power stroke. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the process. If the piston is stuck in the down position, it will disrupt the normal functioning of the internal combustion engine. Step-by-step analysis and justification: 1. Fuel mixes with air: This step will not be affected by the perturbation as it happens before the air-fuel mixture reaches the cylinder. 2. Mix gets inducted into cylinder: This step might be affected depending on how the piston being stuck influences the flow of the air-fuel mixture into the cylinder. If the stuck piston prevents the correct flow of the mixture, the combustion process will be compromised. 3. Piston compresses the mix: This step will be directly affected by the perturbation. Since the piston is stuck in the down position, it will not compress the air-fuel mixture, which is crucial for the proper ignition. 4. Spark plug emits a spark that ignites it causing combustion: This step might not function correctly due to the lack of compression. Since the air-fuel mixture is not compressed, the ignition may be incomplete or lacking in intensity, leading to suboptimal combustion. 5. Combustion gases expand: This step will also be affected, as the incomplete or weaker combustion will lead to less forceful expansion of the combustion gases. 6. Pushes piston during power stroke: This is the primary step that will be directly affected by the perturbation. With the piston stuck in the down position, it will not be able to be pushed up during the power stroke, which compromises the generation of mechanical energy from the combustion process. 7. Exhaust valve opens to vent exhaust out tail pipe: This step might still occur, yet the exhaust gases generated from the compromised combustion process may not have the same composition or volume as those from a normal combustion process. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of the piston being stuck in the down position will have a direct and significant effect on the internal combustion engine's process, leading to reduced or non-existent power generation and potentially harming other engine components due to the disrupted combustion process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The equation is: 1931*k - 18 = -1927*k + 3856*k On the right side of the equation, we have two terms with the variable k, so we can combine them: 1931*k - 18 = ( -1927 + 3856 )*k Step 2: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses. -1927 + 3856 = 1929 Now the equation becomes: 1931*k - 18 = 1929*k Step 3: Move the terms with the variable k to one side of the equation and the constant term to the other side. To do this, we'll subtract 1929*k from both sides of the equation: (1931 - 1929)*k - 18 = 0 2*k - 18 = 0 Next, we'll add 18 to both sides of the equation: 2*k = 18 Step 4: Solve for k by dividing both sides by 2: k = 18 / 2 Step 5: Evaluate the expression. k = 9 So the solution to the equation is k = 9."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They join the countless species that have gone extinct over the course of Earth's history - and extinction means forever. At least it used to. Scientists are now closing in on the ability to bring back extinct species. No, this doesn't mean the plot of Jurassic Park is going to become a reality. Researchers need DNA to bring back a species. DNA is the chemical that carries the structure for a living thing. Dinosaurs have been gone too long for any of their DNA to remain in fossils. But there's a very real chance that we will be able to bring back more recently extinct species. This could even include Ice Age animals like the woolly mammoth. In 2003, a team of Spanish and French scientists re-created the Pyrenean ibex, which had gone extinct three years earlier. The new animal didn't survive long, but scientific advances should improve the success rate. In January, Australian scientists announced that they were on their way to bringing back the gastric brooding frog. That we can bring species back doesn't mean that we should. There may be benefits to reviving a species. But there's no way to know how it will turn out. For example, would a passenger pigeon fit into its old habitat? Or might it crowd out existing species? Environmentalists worry that our ability to bring species back might cut down support for the hard work of traditional conservation. Why worry about preserving a wildlife habitat or fighting poachers if we know we can just make up for our mistakes? But those extinctions are our mistakes to correct, which may give us an obligation to do so.

We have the ability now to repair some of that damage.\\" We would do well to remember the lesson of Jurassic Park: Proceed with caution.

The statement mentions the villager as holding a blacksmith hammer and a wooden shield, which are different weapons and forms of equipment compared to a sword and a dagger. It is important to evaluate such statements based on the available evidence and facts in order to make accurate and logical conclusions. To further analyze the situation, let us first understand the key elements present: 1. Blacksmith hammer: A blacksmith hammer is a specific tool used primarily for forging and shaping metal, particularly in the process of blacksmithing. While it can be used as a weapon in certain circumstances, it is functionally different from a sword or a dagger. 2. Wooden shield: A wooden shield is a form of protective equipment commonly used in different cultures throughout history to block or deflect incoming attacks. This defensive item is employed by either warriors or villagers for personal safety but it does not possess offensive capability like a sword or a dagger. Neither the blacksmith hammer nor the wooden shield are direct substitutes or functionally equivalent to a sword or a dagger. A sword is a long-edged weapon primarily designed for cutting or thrusting, emphasizing on offensive and straightforward combat. A dagger, likewise, is a shorter, pointed weapon often used for slashing, stabbing, or close-quarters self-defense. These two items have distinctive purposes and properties compared to those mentioned earlier. It is crucial to distinguish between these different pieces of equipment and their potential applications. Drawing a conclusion that the villager held a sword and a dagger when the actual situation involves a blacksmith hammer and a wooden shield does not reflect the facts. Without additional information connecting or implying the use of a sword and a dagger, we cannot assume the villager held them. In conclusion, based on the given statement that the villager held a blacksmith hammer and a wooden shield, we cannot accurately claim that the villager also held a sword and a dagger.

The equation can be simplified by removing \\"- 0\\", as subtracting zero does not change the value of the expression. The simplified equation is: 0 = 5*g - 15 Step 2: Isolate the variable g. To isolate g, we need to get rid of the constant term \\"-15\\" on the right side of the equation. We can do this by adding 15 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 15 = 5*g - 15 + 15 This simplifies to: 15 = 5*g Step 3: Solve for g. Now we have an equation with only one term involving g on the right side. To find the value of g, we need to get rid of the coefficient \\"5\\" in front of g. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 5: 15 / 5 = (5*g) / 5 This simplifies to: 3 = g So, the solution to the equation 0 = 5*g - 0 - 15 is g = 3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Argentina's star-studded line-up began their World Cup campaign with a 1-0 victory over Nigeria in their Group B opener in Johannesburg on Saturday. A goal from defender Gabriel Heinze after six minutes was all that separated the two teams after an inspired display from Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama.

Does all of the music bring happiness to you? Do you know some music is noise? What is noise? Noise is a loud or unwanted sound. It is also called noise pollution. Where is noise from? Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects. Scientists use a unit of measure called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels. Noise at this high level causes the greatest hearing loss. How do we reduce noise damage? Turn down your music player or wear ear muffs when you are working in a noisy environment.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Greece will close banks for 6 days, impose limits on withdrawals ATHENS — Greek leaders planned to shutter their banks for six business days starting Monday and impose strict limits on ATM withdrawals amid rising global concerns about the nation’s economic future. Sunday’s decision to declare a bank holiday was a signal that Greece’s five-year battle to stay in the shared euro currency may swiftly be coming to an end, as leaders elsewhere urged steps to find a way to avoid that. Panicked citizens tried to pull their money from their accounts while they still could. ATMs in Athens were running out of money, and tensions were running high as Greeks stood in line for hours to scrape together cash for basic supplies. Lines mounted at gas stations as worried residents topped off their tanks for what could be a protracted period of time in a cashless nation. [Euro, stocks retreat on prospect of Greek default] “The decision not to prolong financial aid to Greece is offensive, and it’s a disgrace for Europe in general,” Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said in a brief Sunday evening address broadcast across Greek television networks. He said he was seeking an extended and enlarged bailout from European lenders that would carry the country past Tuesday, when it will otherwise face default. There were signs that Greece’s creditors — the International Monetary Fund and euro-zone governments — were leaving the door open to negotiations. But it remained unclear ahead of Tuesday’s IMF repayment deadline how Greece would be able to satisfactorily arrange its finances. Tsipras said that the threat by European Union leaders to hold Greece to the deadline and not extend further assistance amounts to “blackmail.” But he gave no concrete indications that he had made any concessions that would change their minds. Negotiations over Greece’s future have been dragging for months. The disagreements are about the extent of the painful reforms it must make to continue receiving the rescue funds that keep the nation’s finances afloat. But talks came to a halt Saturday after Tsipras announced he would hold a referendum on July 5 to ask Greeks whether they would accede to the austerity demands of the nation’s creditors. Greek leaders have urged their citizens to vote no. The government early Monday published the decision to close banks until after the referendum, as well as to impose 66 daily limits on ATM withdrawals. Greeks can continue to pay bills online, but they cannot move their money abroad. A Greek economic official also said that the Greek stock market would remain closed Monday. Most Asian markets were sharply lower on the news, and the euro plunged more than 1 percent against the dollar. The decision to close the banks could help them preserve their vital remaining reserves of cash. But it also remained possible that whenever they reopen, their deposits would no longer be denominated in euros but rather another currency whose value would quickly be worth far less. In a measure of deepening U.S. concern about the consequences for global stability if Greece is kicked out of the euro zone, President Obama and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew worked the phones over the weekend to urge European leaders to take every possible measure to keep Greece within the currency union. The White House said that Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke and “agreed that it was critically important to make every effort to return to a path that will allow Greece to resume reforms and growth within the euro zone.” Greeks queue up to withdraw money amid worries the country could be forced to implement capital controls. (Reuters) And the Treasury Department said Sunday that Lew had spoken a day earlier to key European officials, urging them to maintain financial stability in the coming days — and to consider “potential debt relief.” The decision to close the banks came after the European Central Bank announced Sunday that it would not enlarge an emergency loan program that has been a vital lifeline in recent weeks to Greece’s overextended financial institutions. Fearful Greeks have been pulling their money out of the banks, worried that they could lose access to it altogether or that it could turn into a less valuable currency in the event Greece is kicked out of the euro zone. Greek bank officials said that about 1.1 billion was withdrawn from banks over the weekend. But the ECB also decided not to eliminate the emergency assistance altogether, a step that would have caused immediate bank failures and quickly cast Greece out of the euro zone. Greek finance officials also pledged Sunday to do all they could to keep their nation on an even keel. “The Bank of Greece, as a member of the eurosystem, will take all measures necessary to ensure financial stability for Greek citizens in these difficult circumstances,” Bank of Greece Gov. Yannis Stournaras said in a statement. The closure sought to avoid dealing a grievous blow to Greek tourism, one of the few remaining supports to the country’s economy, by sparing foreign bank cards the withdrawal limits. Earlier Sunday, nations warned their citizens to bring extra cash to Greece if they planned to travel there. But the consequences of Greece’s troubles extend far beyond the realm of economics. Russia has been seeking to exploit the situation by dangling the prospect of aid to Greece while calling for a conciliatory approach toward its actions in the Ukrainian conflict. Top Greek cabinet officials have expressed sympathy for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and in the European Union’s consensus-driven decision-making system, even a single dissenting nation’s vote is enough to put an end to sanctions against Russia. Tsipras has been seeking a decision to unlock the final 8.1 billion installment of emergency funds to help pay for Greece’s short-term financial needs. Without the money, Greece will default on a Tuesday repayment of a 1.7 billion IMF loan. The international bailout program for Greece will expire Tuesday, removing a significant financial shield. E.U. finance ministers said Saturday that Tsipras’s decision to hold a referendum signaled an effective end to the negotiations, and they met immediately to start discussions about how they would bolster the remainder of the euro system if Greece leaves it. But with less than 48 hours before a default, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde on Sunday indicated that the organization remained willing to keep talking, keeping open a window of hope that a deal could be reached. Lagarde said in a statement that she had “shared my disappointment and underscored our commitment to continue to engage with the Greek authorities.” No nation has left the 19-member common currency system since it was started in 1999, and any exit would bring unpredictable consequences. But E.U. leaders say they are far better prepared to guard against Greece’s exit than they were in 2011 and 2012, when the possibility first arose. The mechanics of a Greek exit from the euro zone also remained deeply unclear, because there are no procedures for doing so. Austrian Finance Minister Hans Jörg Schelling suggested in an interview with the Austrian daily Die Presse that Greece would have to leave the European Union altogether. ATMs across central Athens were empty Sunday evening, as worried Greeks pulled as much money as they could from their accounts ahead of an unpredictable week. At the few ATMs that were still dispensing cash, long lines quickly formed. “Everybody was taken by surprise, and people started panicking,” said John Tzamaloukas, 35, who waited 90 minutes to reach the front of an ATM line in central Athens, only to have the machine run out shortly before his turn. He said he had a month-old daughter and needed cash to buy the basics. “You need money to buy milk,” he said.

Passage:Diagnosis of MCC begins with a clinical examination of the skin and lymph nodes. Following, definitive diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) requires examination of biopsy tissue to identify its histopathologic features. An ideal biopsy specimen is either a punch biopsy or a full-thickness incisional biopsy of the skin including full-thickness dermis and subcutaneous fat. On light microscopy, MCC shows basaloid tumor nests with neuroendocrine features (\\"salt and pepper\\" chromatin, scarce cytoplasm, and brisk mitotic activity). In addition to standard examination under light microscopy, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is also generally required to differentiate MCC from other morphologically similar tumors such as small cell lung cancer, the small cell variant of melanoma, various cutaneous leukemic/lymphoid neoplasms, and Ewing's sarcoma. Similarly, most experts recommend longitudinal imaging of the chest, typically a CT scan, to rule out that the possibility that the skin lesion is a skin metastasis of an underlying small cell carcinoma of the lung. Once an MCC diagnosis is made, a sentinel lymph node biopsy is recommended as a part of the staging work-up needed to determine prognosis and subsequent treatment options. Links: a. Biopsy b.

Vasco da Gama was born in 1460 or 1469 in Sines, on the southwest coast of Portugal, probably in a house near the church of Nossa Senhora das Salas. Sines, one of the few seaports on the Alentejo coast, consisted of little more than a cluster of whitewashed, red-tiled cottages, occupied chiefly by fisherfolk. Vasco da Gama's father was Estevao da Gama, who had served in the 1460s as a knight of the household of Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu. He rose in the ranks of the military Order of Santiago. From the earlier part of the 15th century, Portuguese expeditions organized by Prince Henry the Navigator had been reaching down the African coastline, principally in search of west African riches (notably, gold). They had greatly extended Portuguese maritime knowledge, but had little profit to show for the effort. After Henry's death in 1460, the Portuguese Crown showed little interest in continuing this effort and, in 1469, sold off the neglected African enterprise to a private Lisbon merchant consortium led by Fernao Gomes. Within a few years, Gomes' captains expanded Portuguese knowledge across the Gulf of Guinea, doing business in gold dust, Melegueta pepper, ivory and sub-Saharan slaves. When Gomes' charter came up for renewal in 1474, Prince John (future John II), asked his father Afonso V of Portugal to pass the African charter to him. Upon becoming king in 1481, John II of Portugal set out on many long reforms. To break the monarch's dependence on the feudal nobility, John II needed to build up the royal treasury; he considered royal commerce to be the key to achieving that. Under John II's watch, the gold and slave trade in west Africa was greatly expanded. He was eager to break into the highly profitable spice trade between Europe and Asia, which was conducted chiefly by land. At the time, this was virtually monopolized by the Republic of Venice, who operated overland routes via Levantine and Egyptian ports, through the Red Sea across to the spice markets of India. John II set a new objective for his captains: to find a sea route to Asia by sailing around the African continent. By the time Vasco da Gama was in his 20s, the king's plans were coming to fruition. In 1487, John II dispatched two spies, Pero da Covilha and Afonso de Paiva, overland via Egypt to East Africa and India, to scout the details of the spice markets and trade routes. The breakthrough came soon after, when John II's captain Bartolomeu Dias returned from rounding the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, having explored as far as the Fish River (Rio do Infante) in modern-day South Africa and having verified that the unknown coast stretched away to the northeast. An explorer was needed who could prove the link between the findings of Dias and those of da Covilha and de Paiva, and connect these separate segments into a potentially lucrative trade route across the Indian Ocean.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who headed the explorations?","completion":"A person named Vasco da Gama headed the explorations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Texas church where a gunman opened fire during Sunday services, killing 26 and injuring 20, may not reopen. Pastor Frank Pomeroy of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this week that it would be too painful to continue using the church as a place of worship. Pomeroy, who lost his own 14-year-old daughter in the massacre, proposed turning the site into a memorial and building another church on a different site. The final decision on the fate of the building will be made by the denomination's top leaders, who traveled to the rural community in a show of support. But a national Southern Baptist spokesman said the pastor's wishes will be taken into consideration. Other sites of mass shootings have been torn down, including Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012. A new school was built elsewhere. A one-room Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was torn down in 2006, 10 days after an assailant took children hostage and shot and killed five girls ages 6 to 13. The original site of the school is now a pasture. A nearly identical schoolhouse with a security fence was erected nearby.

I like to think it was in the heart of Florida, because it was, and is, in my heart. Its name was Dogland. Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled. And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes. And then Grandma Bette wouldn't say a word for half an hour or more, a very long time for Grandma Bette to be quiet.

To help clarify, here are the items from your choices that emit electromagnetic radiation, along with explanations: 1. Light Bulb - A light bulb emits electromagnetic radiation in the form of visible light and heat when switched on. 2. Vehicles - Parts of a vehicle's electrical system emit electromagnetic radiation, such as radio units and in-car infotainment systems. 3. Satellites - Satellites emit electromagnetic radiation, primarily in the form of radio waves, to communicate with receivers on Earth. Satellites also use solar panels that absorb electromagnetic radiation from sunlight and convert it into electrical power. 4. Buses - Like vehicles, buses also come with electrical systems that emit electromagnetic radiation, including radio units, GPS devices, and infotainment systems. 5. Engines - Engine ignition systems emit electromagnetic radiation in the form of radio waves due to switching and sparking, although these emissions are generally minimal. Other items in the list, such as firecrackers, sensory neurons, and objects, do not emit significant electromagnetic radiation. Firecrackers primarily release chemical energy in the form of heat, light, and sound. Sensory neurons transmit electrical signals through the nervous system, which is not the same as emitting electromagnetic radiation.

News article: The groups that have Hillary’s back Washington (CNN) - It's a daily war of words playing out on multiple battlefields from the cable news networks to social media - pro-Republican groups criticize Hillary Clinton. The fire is quickly returned by pro-Democratic groups that defend the former secretary of state, who's seriously considering a 2016 White House run. And the frequency of the skirmishes are increasing with \\"Hard Choices,\\" Clinton's much anticipated memoir of her years as America's top diplomat, hitting bookshelves next week. Hillary Clinton to take part in live CNN town hall The Republican National Committee and the pro-GOP opposition research shop America Rising have been at the forefront of the Clinton anti-Clinton assault, which mainly focuses on the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans. \\"Find out the TRUTH about @HillaryClinton,\\" tweeted America Rising, which in a pre-buttal is going up with an e-book titled \\"Failed Choices\\" that's a critique of Clinton's tenure at the State Department. What's behind stepped up GOP attacks on Clinton Correct the Record responded with a post headlined \\"Shame On America Rising for Willfully Misleading Americans On Secretary Clinton's Record.\\" Correct the Record was launched last year by American Bridge, the leading Democratic opposition research outfit. Correct the Record was created to defend the records of potential Democratic presidential candidates. In reality, that means protecting Clinton, who has said she'll decide by the end of this year on a presidential bid, and would instantly become the overwhelming frontrunner for the Democratic nomination if she runs. The group is run by some former top Clinton advisers, but says it doesn't coordinate in any way with the former secretary of state or her top aides. Correct the Record officials say they're not doing anything special for the release of the book and the ensuing coast to coast book tour by Clinton. \\"We're operating business as usual. We are continuing to do what we do every day, defending Secretary Clinton's strong record of accomplishments from baseless, right-wing attacks,\\" Adrienne Elrod, the group's chief spokeswoman, told CNN. Last weekend the group held media training sessions for surrogates going on television to discuss the book and Clinton's record. \\"It wasn't only for the book. The purpose of the media training was to make sure that our surrogates, people who are on TV, active on TV, are able to articulate her positions effectively. Especially her accomplishments as Secretary of State,\\" a Correct the Record official told CNN. The Democratic National Committee's also playing a role when it comes to defending Clinton. The DNC has a mandate to protect the Democratic brand, and Clinton was, and continues to be a major player in that brand. The DNC, of course, also plays a major role in defending President Barack Obama and his administration. And GOP attacks on Clinton that target her record at State are also attacks on the President. \\"With the recent Republican attacks on Hillary Clinton, you've seen them really focus on foreign policy, attacking the President's foreign policy,\\" said a Democratic Party official. \\"Hillary's book is about her work with the President during his first term. It's about the Obama administration's foreign policy accomplishments and what we've seen is Republicans trying to distort every aspect of the President's foreign policy accomplishments.\\" It was no surprise then that Clinton aides deferred to the DNC when it came to responding to the America Rising e-book. In another sign of stepped up cooperation, Democratic surrogates and communicators who publicly support both Obama and Clinton met at the White House recently with Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri and Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes to talk about a number of issues, including Benghazi and Clinton's upcoming book, according to a source familiar with the meeting. While the topic was not on the official meeting agenda, one surrogate asked about it and the President's aides made clear they want no daylight between Obama and Clinton on foreign policy issues as the book rolls out, the source added. The messaging, according to the source, is this: Obama's team of rivals became an unrivaled team. And Tommy Vietor, a communications veteran of the 2008 Obama campaign who served as National Security Council spokesman during the President's first term, has been brought on by the Clinton team to coordinate and assist in the response to the book. In addition to working with the White House, the Clinton camp has stepped up their messaging around the book's release to include a coordinated surrogate operation. Clinton's team, according to sources familiar with the book rollout, tapped Kiki McLean, a former Clinton senior adviser and veteran of five presidential campaigns, to lend a hand with the surrogate operation. This group includes a war room of former diplomats who stand ready to respond to criticism of Clinton's tenure at the State Department, according to the source. From book tour to bus tour Also upping their game as the book releases is Ready for Hillary, the pro-Clinton super PAC that concentrates on grassroots outreach. The group, which over past year has organized demonstrations in support of Clinton outside of many of her speaking events, says it will step up its presence on during the book tour. The most visible way is with what they call \\"The Hillary Bus.\\" \\"The Bus will travel from coast to coast, channeling the enthusiasm around a potential Hillary 2016 candidacy to activate supporters in the 2014 midterms, while further building a grassroots army of supporters who are encouraging her to run and ready to help her win,\\" the group said earlier this week. Ready for Hillary says that throughout the summer, their bus will also visit events other than the \\"Hard Choices\\" book tour, such as Democratic party gatherings, state fairs and community festivals. And that come the autumn, the bus will head to college campuses and states with key contests in this November's midterm elections. The group touts that their bus \\"is a mobile advertisement allowing our organization to reach new supporters in every corner of America as Hillary backers who see the Bus are prompted to sign up at readyforhillary.com. The Bus will also allow Ready for Hillary to dispatch volunteers and sign up new supporters at designated stops.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1.

Context: You mentioned hearing the lawnmower from \\"across the street,\\" which indicates that the source of the noise is not within your own property. This logically points toward the lawnmower being at a neighbor's house rather than in your shed or garage. 2. Function: Lawnmowers are specifically designed for cutting grass, and the sound produced by them typically signifies that they are actively in use. While it is technically possible for a lawnmower to be stored in a shed or garage, the fact that you can hear it in operation strongly suggests that it is currently being used to cut grass. In this case, the neighbor's house would be where this activity is taking place. 3. Specificity: Among the given options, \\"cutting grass\\" and \\"lawn\\" both accurately describe the activity the lawnmower is engaged in and the general location of the task. However, these answers are too generic to provide a precise location of where the lawnmower is.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: What does Selina think will help repair redness and brown spots from skin? Options: - using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser - use just water to cleanse - use abrasive soap - not enough information Answer:","completion":"- using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency writing the rules, estimates 20% of hemp lots would fail under the proposed regulations. “Their business is to support farmers — and not punish farmers — and the rules as they’re written right now punish farmers,” said Dove Oldham, who last year grew an acre (0.40 hectares) of hemp on her family farm in Grants Pass. “There’s just a lot of confusion, and people are just looking for leadership.” The USDA did not respond to the criticism but has taken the unusual step of extending the public comment period by a month, until Jan. 29. The agency told The Associated Press it will analyze information from this year’s growing season before releasing its final rules, which would take effect in 2021. Agricultural officials in states that run pilot hemp cultivation programs under an earlier federal provision are weighing in with formal letters to the USDA. “There are 46 states where hemp is legal, and I’m going to say that every single state has raised concerns to us about something within the rule. They might be coming from different perspectives, but every state has raised concerns,” said Aline DeLucia, director of public policy for the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture. Most of the anxiety involves how the federal government plans to test for THC, the high-inducing compound found in marijuana and hemp, both cannabis plants. The federal government and most states consider plants with tiny amounts — 0.3% or less — to be hemp. Anything above that is marijuana and illegal under federal law. Yet another cannabis compound has fueled the explosion in hemp cultivation. Cannabidiol, or CBD, is marketed as a health and wellness aid and infused in everything from food and drinks to lotions, toothpaste and pet treats. Many have credited CBD with helping ease pain, increase sleep and reduce anxiety. But scientists caution not enough is known about its health effects, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year targeted nearly two dozen companies for making CBD health claims. Still, the CBD market is increasing at a triple-digit rate and could have 20 billion in sales by 2024, according to a recent study by BDS Analytics, a marketing analysis firm that tracks cannabis industry trends. About 80% of the 18,000 farmers licensed for hemp cultivation are in the CBD market, said Eric Steenstra, president of the advocacy group Vote Hemp. The remaining 20% grow hemp for its fiber, used in everything from fabric to construction materials, or its grain, which is added to health foods. But hemp is a notoriously fickle crop. Conditions such as sunlight, moisture and soil composition determine its ratio of THC to CBD. Choosing the right harvesting window is critical to ensuring it stays within acceptable THC levels. Under the draft USDA rules, farmers have no wiggle room. They must harvest within 15 days of testing their crop for THC, and the samples must be sent to a lab certified by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Samples must be from the top of the plant, where THC levels are highest, and the final measurement must include not just THC, but also THCA, a nonpsychoactive component. Crops that test above 0.3% for the two combined must be destroyed. Growers with crops above 0.5% would be considered in “negligent violation,” and those with repeated violations could be suspended from farming hemp. In addition, a pilot program for federal crop insurance that would be available to hemp growers in some states specifies that crops lost because of high THC levels won’t be covered. Those provisions are causing alarm among growers and states with pilot hemp programs allowed under the 2014 Farm Bill. Some states allow THC levels above 0.3%, and not all include THCA in that calculation. Many permit more harvesting time for growers after THC testing. Farmers are lobbying for a 1% THC limit and a 30-day harvest window to give them more flexibility while remaining well under THC levels that can get people high. The draft regulations don’t “seem to be informed by the reality of the crop,” said Jesse Richardson, who with his brother sells CBD-infused teas and capsules under the brand The Brothers Apothecary. “If no one can produce (federally) compliant hemp flower, then there will be no CBD oil on the market.” Growers are also worried about the proposed rule requiring that all THC testing be done in a DEA-certified lab because there are so few of them. Some states have only one, which would serve hundreds of growers in a short harvest window. Samantha Ford, a third-generation farmer in North Carolina, waited two weeks to get back THC results from a lab last fall and then spent 45 days harvesting her 1 acre (0.40 hectares) of hemp by hand. “The 15-day window — that’s not feasible, and that was on a small scale,” she said. “I can’t imagine farmers who have acres and acres and acres of it.” Concerns also have emerged about the workload the draft rules would place on states. Many do random sampling for THC levels, but the USDA would require five samples from every hemp lot — a burden for state agricultural departments, said DeLucia, of the national ag agencies group. If federal rules are too onerous and expensive, some states might drop their hemp programs. In those cases, farmers would have to apply for licenses with the USDA, and at this stage it’s unclear how U.S. officials would manage or pay for a nationwide licensing program, DeLucia said. Under the 2018 Farm Bill, the USDA must approve state plans for hemp programs. Louisiana, Ohio and New Jersey last month were the first to get the green light — but those plans might need to be reworked after final rules are written. “What we don’t want to see is states having to write their rules and then have to change the rules again and rewrite them” after 2021, said Steenstra, of Vote Hemp. Claim: High anxiety: Proposed US hemp rules worry industry . A:","completion":"The given claim states that the proposed U.S. hemp rules are causing anxiety within the industry. The paragraph supports this claim as it describes the concerns that hemp farmers, processors, retailers, and state governments have raised about the draft rules. These concerns include the stringent THC testing requirements, fear of crop destruction, and the heavy-handed approach of the U.S. government towards hemp cultivation. Moreover, it highlights the fact that there is confusion regarding the rules, and people are looking for guidance. The USDA's extension of the public comment period and plans to analyze information from the current growing season before releasing the final rules indicate that the agency is taking the concerns seriously. The anxiety over draft rules also stems from variations in state regulations and the potential workload that would be placed on states, risking some to drop their hemp programs. In conclusion, the industry's anxiety is based on the potential negative impacts of the proposed rules, lack of guidance, and the disagreement between state and federal regulations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If you use dentures, remove them before brushing. If you’re assisting someone else, stand behind them and off to 1 side. Wear gloves. Peel back their lips with your fingers before brushing the teeth and gums thoroughly. A good mouthwash will kill bacteria in your mouth, even if you don't have teeth. Swish or gargle the mouthwash for 30 seconds before spitting it out in a sink or cup. If desired, add cleaning tablets to the water. When you remove the dentures in the morning, rinse them off with clean water and brush them before putting them in your mouth. Flossing helps remove bacteria between your teeth. Use about 18 inches (46 cm) of floss, and wind the ends around your forefinger and thumb. Slide the floss up between your teeth and down again. If you’re assisting someone else, make sure to wear gloves. Don’t snap the floss between the teeth. Instead, slowly ease it up and down.

Review: This was the first sequel I'd seen (apart from Return of Jafar) and I honestly thought before watching it that it would be close to the original. I was horribly disappointed. The storyline was, basically, the first script with a few extra characters and the situation turned around. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody who isn't satisfied with life on land. She wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her-and when Melody finds out she's upset and angry. And she then decides to run away, and she becomes a mermaid. So she's happy swimming around, and Ariel sets out to find her-as a mermaid. The story doesn't sound too bad written down, but the clichés and repeats of situations from the first movie are just too obvious. And adding the fact that Melody is, overall, extremely annoying, and the movie becomes almost unbearable. There's also a whole load of other new characters-Tip and Dash being two of them. They aren't too bad as characters in themselves-just try not to think of Timon or Pumbaa! The songs leave a lot to be desired too, they just don't have the same magical energy as the songs from the original did. The animation obviously didn't have a whole load of work put into it either-in parts it's jumpy, and not much imagination is used for the characters movements. Another piece of advice-try to forget about Ariel's original character while watching this movie. The beautiful, rebellious, curious teenager has 'all grown up' into a bland, boring wife and mother, and her trademark red hair is all tied up. This is much better viewed if you've never seen the original-you'll have nothing to compare it to. However, all in all, it could have been worse-it's not as bad as certain other sequels, such as Cinderella II. But it's not in the same league as the original. But it for your collection if nothing else but if Disney go on like this they'll lose all their older fans. What is the sentiment of this review?

Seattle is a charter city, with a mayor–council form of government. From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Emotional ad seen as answer to Paul racist newsletter flap Ron Paul as seen in the Revolution PAC video. The video features a black man… Following an uproar over decades-old racist newsletters published under Ron Paul's name, a newly released ad seems designed to address the perception that the GOP presidential hopeful is prejudiced. The video, released by Revolution PAC, features a black man whose sick, pregnant white wife was neglected at a Texas hospital during the early 1970s because of what he saw as prejudice â until \\"Ron Paul came to the rescue.\\" Paul worked as a doctor at the facility. In the ad â which never mentions the newsletter controversy â James Williams, of Matagorda County, Texas, recounts a harrowing experience at the hospital, where he said the biracial couple fell victim to racism. He says that his ailing wife was left unattended, and his repeated requests for help made to the head nurse were not only rebuffed, but prompted a call to police, because the nurse felt harassed. As Williams despaired, he said Paul emerged, and offered to care for his wife. Ten minutes later, Williams said, their child was delivered â a stillborn boy. Paul told him he'd take care of the bill, and Williams said he was never charged. \\"He was a doctor of medicine, and that's what he was doing, practicing medicine. And it didn't matter who and what and why,\\" Williams said. Paul helped, Williams said, because \\"he thinks of one human being just as much as another one. Heâs just an honest man. And thatâs something we need now in this day and time. \\" Veering into politics, Williams condemns attempts to \\"blot out\\" Paul because he is an honest politician. The ad ends with a call to donate money to get the video shown on television, but itâs clearly had no trouble attracting attention. Paul has repeatedly disavowed the content of the controversial newsletters, saying they were penned by ghostwriters and conceding he should have done a better job of keeping track of them. The screedsâ targets included blacks and homosexuals. \\"Dr. Paul has assumed responsibility, apologized for his lack of oversight and disavowed the offensive material,\\" his spokesman told Reuters recently. Despite the controversy, Paul has been faring well in recent days, with an NBC/Marist poll Friday showing Paul running two percentage points behind frontrunner Mitt Romney as Tuesday's Iowa caucuses loom. Jonathan Capehart argued in the Washington Post on Thursday that the new ad does not go far enough to address concerns raised by the newsletters. \\"Paul, a man who wants to be entrusted with the presidency, owes the American people a clear accounting of how hatred came to be scribbled regularly in publications bearing his name and how he had no knowledge of it. His dismissive disavowal of the matter is beyond inadequate. As is the ad from supporter,\\" Capehart wrote. MSNBC's First Read reported that part of the ad was played for Paul during an appearance on WHO radio in Iowa, and the congressman was moved. He said that while he was just doing his job that day in Texas, \\"I never had the knowledge [of] how grateful he was and to me that is magnificent,\\" MSNBC quoted Paul as saying","completion":"A new advertisement by Revolution PAC aims to confront the perception that GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul is prejudiced, following controversial racist newsletters published under his name years ago. The ad features a black man, James Williams, recounting a story from the early 1970s when Paul, then a doctor, stepped in to help Williams' sick, pregnant white wife at a Texas hospital, where she had been neglected due to perceived racism. Although the ad does not directly address the newsletter issues, it aims to highlight Paul's character and fairness.

Q:Information: - The Ozarks, also referred to as the Ozark Mountains, Ozarks Mountain Country, and the Ozark Plateau, is a physiographic and geologic highland region of the central United States, primarily in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. The Ozarks cover a significant portion of southern Missouri, extending as far northeast as the southwestern suburbs of St. Louis. In Arkansas, a large portion is contained within the northwestern and northcentral region. Much smaller pieces of the Ozarks extend westward into northeastern Oklahoma and extreme southeastern Kansas. - The tallgrass prairie is an ecosystem native to central North America. Natural and anthropogenic fire, as well as grazing by large mammals (primarily bison), were historically agents of periodic disturbance, which regulates tree encroachment, recycles nutrients to the soil, and catalyzes some seed dispersal and germination processes. Prior to widespread use of the steel plow, which enabled conversion to agricultural land use, tallgrass prairies expanded throughout the American Midwest and smaller portions of southern central Canada, from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests, west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils, to the southern reaches of the Flint Hills in Oklahoma, to a transition into forest in Manitoba. - Richard Hanson ( born February 20 , 1940 ) served as secretary of state of Missouri in 1994 following the removal from office of his predecessor , Judith Moriarty . A Democrat from Cole County , Hanson served on an interim basis in 1994 from the time of Moriarty 's removal from office by the Missouri Supreme Court following her impeachment by the Missouri House of Representatives until Governor Mel Carnahan appointed Bekki Cook to serve until the following scheduled election for the office . - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - St. Louis is an independent city and major U.S. port in the State of Missouri, built along the western bank of the Mississippi River, on the border with Illinois. The city has an estimated 2015 population of 315,685, and is the cultural and economic center of the Greater St. Louis area (home to 2,916,447 people), making it the largest metropolitan area in Missouri and the 19th-largest in the United States. - Judith K. Moriarty (born February 2, 1942) is an American politician from Missouri, first with the Democratic Party, switching to the Libertarian Party in 2005. She was the first woman to serve as Missouri Secretary of State. - The Missouri Bootheel is the southeasternmost part of the state of Missouri, extending south of 36°30 north latitude, so called because its shape in relation to the rest of the state resembles the heel of a boot. Strictly speaking, it is composed of the counties of Dunklin, New Madrid, and Pemiscot.

Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: OPTIONS: - negative - positive TEXT:Corean cinema can be quite surprising for an occidental audience, because of the multiplicity of the tones and genres you can find in the same movie. In a Coreen drama such as this \\"Secret Sunshine\\", you'll also find some comical parts, thriller scenes and romantic times. \\"There's not only tragedy in life, there's also tragic-comedy\\" says at one point of the movie the character interpreted by Song Kang-ho, summing up the mixture of the picture. But don't get me wrong, this heterogeneity of the genres the movie deals with, adds veracity to the experience this rich movie offers to its spectators. That doesn't mean that it lacks unity : on the contrary, it's rare to see such a dense and profound portrait of a woman in pain. Shin-ae, who's in quest for a quiet life with her son in the native town of her late husband, really gives, by all the different faces of suffering she's going through, unity to this movie. It's realistic part is erased by the psychological descriptions of all the phases the poor mother is going through. Denial, lost, anger, faith, pert of reality : the movie fallows all the steps the character crosses, and looks like a psychological catalog of all the suffering phases a woman can experience. The only thing is to accept what may look like a conceptual experience (the woman wears the mask of tragedy, the man represents the comical interludes) and to let the artifices of the movie touch you. I must say that some parts of the movie really did move me (especialy in the beginning), particularly those concerning the unability of Chang Joan to truly help the one he loves, but also that the accumulation of suffering emotionally tired me towards the end. Nevertheless, some cinematographic ideas are really breathtaking and surprising (the scene where a body is discovered in a large shot is for instance amazing). This kind of scenes makes \\"Secret Sunshine\\" the melo equivalent of \\"The Host\\" for horror movies or \\"Memories of murder\\" for thrillers. These movies are indeed surprising, most original, aesthetically incredible, and manage to give another dimension to the genres they deal with. The only thing that \\"Secret Sunshine\\" forgets, as \\"The host\\" forgot to be scary, is to make its audience cry : bad point for a melodrama, but good point for a good film.","completion":"The correct sentiment for this text is: positive Step-by-step justification: 1. The text highlights the diverse tones and genres found within the movie, which adds veracity and enriches the experience for the audience. 2. The author appreciates the dense and profound portrayal of the protagonist, Shin-ae, and considers it a unifying element within the movie. 3. The psychological depth of the movie is praised in the text, as it effectively covers the various emotions and phases of suffering a person may experience. 4.

The identity of the donor has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges. From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple.

Hypothesis: He was struggling to sit up because of a severe headache. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"The hypothesis that he was struggling to sit up because of a severe headache is not necessarily entailed by the premise. While the premise does describe the character as struggling to sit up, it doesn't provide any clear information about the cause of the struggle, which could be due to various reasons including illness, injury, disorientation, or physical limitations. In order to better understand whether the hypothesis you provided is entailed by the premise, let's take a closer look at the premise and examine possible alternative explanations. The premise states that the character managed to struggle up to a sitting position in the bed, which suggests that they had difficulty reaching this position. It also says that the character was trying to make out more of their surroundings, implying some level of uncertainty or confusion regarding their environment. The hypothesis you provided guesses that the struggle to sit up was due to a severe headache, but this information is not explicitly mentioned in the premise. It's important to consider alternative explanations for the character's struggle to sit up and to understand their surroundings. For instance: 1. The character could have been disoriented or confused due to being in an unfamiliar environment or waking up from a deep sleep, which might not involve a severe headache. 2. The character may have suffered from a physical injury that made sitting up painful or difficult, such as a back or neck injury, rather than a headache. 3. A medical condition, such as sleep paralysis or muscle weakness, could have caused the character to struggle to move while waking up, regardless of whether or not they were experiencing head pain. Although the hypothesis of a severe headache causing the character's difficulties is plausible, it is not directly entailed by the premise, as there is no explicit mention of a headache being the primary reason for their struggles.

Please answer the following question: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Tommy Lynn Sells, 49, was the first inmate to be injected with a dose of recently replenished stocks of the powerful sedative pentobarbital. US states are facing a shortage of execution drugs as a growing number of firms have refused to sell them. Sells' lawyers tried unsuccessfully to find out the names of the suppliers. Debate about the source of execution drugs has recently become contentious in several states as numerous drug makers have refused to sell their products if they are used in executions. Opposition is especially strong among European drug makers, where concern over capital punishment is fiercest. A lower court earlier stopped Sells' execution, ordering the Texas Department of Criminal Justice to reveal more information about the drug supplier, but its ruling was overturned on appeal. The convicted man's attorneys argued that they needed to know the name of the pharmacy supplying the pentobarbital in order to verify the drug's quality and protect him from unconstitutional pain and suffering. \\"Without transparency about lethal injections, particularly the source and purity of drugs to be used, it is impossible to ensure that executions are humane and constitutional,\\" lawyers Maurie Levin and Jonathan Ross said in a statement. But the Supreme Court agreed with Texas prison officials, who argued that information about the drug supplier must be kept secret to protect the pharmacy from threats of violence. The justices did not elaborate on the reasoning behind their ruling, which was issued about an hour before Sells' execution. Last month a pharmacy in the state of Oklahoma said that it would not supply pentobarbital to neighbouring Missouri for use in an execution. Sells was convicted of murder in 2000 for stabbing Kaylene Harris, 13, to death and slashing her 10-year-old friend, Krystal Surles, who survived and helped police find him. US media reports said Sells had confessed to as many as 70 killings across the US. He declined to give a statement prior to his execution. Sells was pronounced dead 13 minutes after being given the pentobarbital. His execution was the fifth lethal injection this year in Texas, the busiest state in the US for enforcing the death penalty. Nearly 1,400 men have been put to death since the US Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.","completion":"US inmate executed in Texas amid debate over drug source, as states face a shortage of execution drugs and drug makers increasingly refuse to sell their products for use in executions."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"What gives rise to offspring?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"reproduction is the process by which living things give rise to offspring\\" and \\"physiologically, sex is for the purpose of reproduction\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? a). sex b). spring c). bird d). DNA e). ova f). production g). factories h). ovum A:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What gives rise to offspring?\\" is a). sex. This is because, as your teacher mentioned, reproduction is the process by which living things give rise to offspring. Furthermore, they added that physiologically, sex is for the purpose of reproduction. Based on these hints, we can infer that sex is the process that leads to the creation of offspring. Let's briefly analyze the other options as well: b). Spring: Spring is a season and not related to the creation of offspring. c). Bird: While birds do reproduce and give rise to offspring, the question is asking for the process that leads to offspring, not a specific organism. d). DNA: DNA carries genetic information but is not the process responsible for giving rise to offspring. e). Ova: Ova (plural for ovum) are female reproductive cells (eggs) that play a crucial role in reproduction, but the question is referring to the process rather than a specific cell type. f). Production: Production is a broad term and can relate to manufacturing, agriculture, and more, but in this context, it does not specifically refer to the process that gives rise to offspring. g). Factories: Factories are industrial buildings where products are manufactured or assembled, not the process that gives rise to offspring. h). Ovum: An ovum, or egg cell, is a female reproductive cell. While it is involved in the process of reproduction, it is not the best answer to the question, as we are looking for a process leading to the creation of offspring. In summary, based on the teacher's hints and the analysis of the given options, a). sex is the best answer to the question as it directly corresponds to the process of reproduction that gives rise to offspring in living beings."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer??","completion":"To find the value of f in the equation 18 = -6*f - 12, follow these steps: Step 1: Add 12 to both sides of the equation. By doing this, you are trying to isolate the term with the variable f. Add 12 to both sides to determine the intermediate result: 18 + 12 = -6*f - 12 + 12 30 = -6*f Step 2: Solve for f by dividing both sides of the equation by -6. Now you only need to isolate f by dividing both sides of the equation by the constant that is multiplied with the variable (in this case, -6): 30 / -6 = (-6*f) / -6 So, we get: -5 = f Now, we have the value of f: f = -5 The solution to the equation 18 = -6*f - 12 for the variable f is -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The winter wind hurried down Columbus Avenue and the hem of his coat flapped around his knees letting little pockets of cold waft up to invade the warmth his body had spent so much time preparing and storing around his torso. With a bitter squeeze of his hands, his knuckles now getting cold, Morzeny bowed his square shoulders to the wind and continued walking. At sixty-seven years old the New York winters bothered Morzeny more than he cared to admit. And, although no doctor would admit it to him, he was positive that the first faint hints of arthritis tweaking through his hands were made worse by the cold. At every cross street the setting sun flashed through to the avenue in shades of crisp pink and red. Morzeny didn't want to be working right now. But these outings were the price he paid for having a hybrid job, owning buildings and brokering as many of his own leases as possible. When he had first come to the city he had been told that he needed a job, not for income, his providers took care of that, but for his own sanity. Something to keep him going. He had asked for something in real estate and had never bothered to wonder what other paths he might have taken. He had always been able to focus to the point of blindness. It helped him in every aspect of his work. He arrived at the brownstone building housing the apartment he was to show tonight. His building was tucked into a short row of buildings that squatted over the street, their steps reaching towards the curb like stunted growths.

Question 1: Why is it that people call it DP in FB and WhatsApp instead of profile picture? Where did come from? Question 2: Can I use prime minister picture as my WhatsApp profile picture? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"To answer these questions, I will break down each question into smaller parts, find the required information, and ensure the answer is relevant and well-founded. Question 1: Why is it that people call it DP in FB and WhatsApp instead of profile picture? Where did it come from? Step 1: Understand the meaning of the abbreviation DP. DP stands for Display Picture, which is another term for a profile picture. Step 2: Research the origin and usage of DP. The term DP (Display Picture) became more popular in countries like India and Pakistan during the early days of social media platforms and instant messaging apps. It was commonly used on platforms like Orkut, Yahoo Messenger, BBM, etc. Step 3: Compare the usage of \\"DP\\" and \\"profile picture.\\" While \\"profile picture\\" is the more common term used by platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, earlier platforms used the term \\"Display Picture\\" or simply \\"DP.\\" The term continues to be used by social media users in some regions as colloquial language. Answer to Question 1: People call it DP (Display Picture) in FB (Facebook) and WhatsApp because the term became popular in the early days of social media platforms and instant messaging apps, particularly in countries like India and Pakistan. The legacy of the term has since been carried forward to more current platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp in those regions. Question 2: Can I use the prime minister's picture as my WhatsApp profile picture? Step 1: Analyze the legality of using the prime minister's picture. There aren't any specific laws against using a prime minister's picture as a profile picture. However, depending on your country, laws around the depiction of public figures and the manner in which their images are used can vary. Step 2: Assess the platform's terms and conditions for profile pictures. WhatsApp's terms of service don't explicitly prohibit using a politician's image as a profile picture. But as a user, you should ensure that the image is not offensive or violating any copyright laws. Step 3: Evaluate potential consequences. Using the prime minister's picture as a profile picture, depending on the context, can lead to misunderstandings and confusion amongst your contacts. Consider the aim of such usage before uploading the image. Answer to Question 2: You can use the prime minister's picture as your WhatsApp profile picture as long as it doesn't violate any laws or platform regulations, such as being offensive or violating copyright laws. Be mindful of the potential implications and consequences, including misunderstandings and confusion. Would the answer to these two questions be the same? No, the answers to these two questions are not the same. While the first question deals with the origin of the term \\"DP\\" and its usage on social media platforms, the second question concerns the legality and implications of using a prime minister's picture as a profile picture on WhatsApp."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He cryptically promises his father he will \\"bring him home.\\" Rama joins a heavily armed 20-man elite police squad, including Officers Bowo and Dagu, Sergeant Jaka, and Lieutenant Wahyu, for a raid on a high-rise apartment block in Jakarta's slums. The team intends to capture crime lord Tama Riyadi, who, along with his two lieutenants Andi and Mad Dog, owns the block and lets criminals around the city rent rooms under his protection. Arriving undetected, the team sweeps the first floors and subdues various criminal tenants; they also temporarily detain an innocent, law-abiding tenant delivering medicine to his sick wife in apartment #726. Continuing undetected to the sixth floor, the team is spotted by a young lookout, who passes on the message to another adolescent lookout just before he is shot dead by Wahyu; but the latter youth raises the alarm. Tama calls down reinforcements and the SWAT team are brutally attacked. Thugs snipe two officers guarding the perimeter, eliminate two more in the SWAT van, and ambush several officers patrolling the first five floors. Cutting the lights, Tama announces over the PA system that the police are trapped on the sixth-floor stairwell, and he will grant free permanent residence to those who kill the intruders. In the darkness, the remaining team members are ambushed by shooters from above and behind, and the team is almost completely wiped out. Prior to the gunfight, Wahyu confesses to Jaka he has staged the mission so he can eliminate Tama, who is in league with many corrupt police officers, including himself. The mission is not officially sanctioned by the police command; nobody at HQ knows their location and thus there is no hope for reinforcements.

It's unclear as to whether or not the liquid was for an e-cigarette but officials expressed their concern about similar accidents happening to children of e-cigarette smokers in the future. 'One teaspoon of liquid nicotine could be lethal to a child, and smaller amounts can cause severe illness, often requiring trips to the emergency department,' the American Association of Poison Control centers in a statement yesterday. They also states that even though liquid nicotine is dangerous for children there are currently no child-proof packaging standards set in place. The American Association of Poison Control Centers made an announcement in November that the number of exposures to liquid nicotine is on the rise. By November 30 there had been 3,638 exposures to the dangerous chemical. That's more than double the 1,543 exposures reported in 2013. In 2011 just 271 exposures were counted. The child's death on Tuesday marks the first death related to the substance since 2012 when a man injected himself with the chemical. Dr.Donna Seger, director of the poison control center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said that even the smallest amount of nicotine can be dangerous for children. 'They’re not that difficult to get into,' Seger said of the vials that contain the nicotine. 'The issue is once the exposure occurs, it could be bad.' ABC spoke with Phil Daman, president of the Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association who questioned whether or not the nicotine the child found was in fact the standard liquid used for e-cigarettes. Growing popularity: As the popularity of e-cigarettes increases so does the number of dangerous exposures to -liquid nicotine used in the cigarette. The liquids range in strength from low to high and the one consumed by the child could have been a higher dosage than normal. Daman also said he was, 'saddened to hear the terrible news.' '[We] want to always be mindful to put safe products on the market,' said Daman. He said companies should do their best to 'err on the side of caution.' Symptoms of nicotine exposure are vomiting, nausea, and eye irritation. Children may be more likely to consume the nicotine liquids that are flavored and made to look like candy. 'E-cigarette liquids as currently sold are a threat to small children because they are not required to be childproof, and they come in candy and fruit flavors that are appealing to children,' said U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden in April. As more and more children become exposed, legislators and companies are taking steps to ensure safety. The e-cigarette Vapor World, changed their packaging to make bottles child resistant. Governor Andrew Cuomo of is set to sign a bill in coming weeks that will require child-resistant caps on liquid nicotine bottles.","completion":"A one-year-old baby in New York sadly passed away after accidentally swallowing liquid nicotine, which is a chemical used in e-cigarettes. The baby was found unresponsive and was taken to the hospital but couldn't be saved. This has raised concerns about the safety of using e-cigarettes around young children and the need for child-proof packaging. Liquid nicotine is very dangerous for children, even in small amounts. The baby's death has reminded people to be extra careful when using e-cigarettes and to keep the liquid nicotine safely away from children."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Michael \\"Mick\\" McGeough (pronounced \\"mik-GOOH\\"; born June 20, 1957) is a retired National Hockey League referee, who wore uniform number 19 (now worn by Gord Dwyer) from the 199495 NHL season until his retirement. His NHL career began in 1987. McGeough was one of the last NHL officials to officiate NHL games without wearing a helmet when he was on the ice. In the 200607 NHL season, McGeough was forced by the NHL to wear a helmet on ice, as it was the first season that dictated that all on-ice officials had to do so. He now is helping the NHL bring up new recruits from the AHL. Entering the 200708 NHL season, McGeough had officiated 1,023 regular season and 63 post season games. - James McGeough ( born April 13 , 1963 in Regina , Saskatchewan ) is a retired Canadian ice hockey player . He is the brother of former NHL referee Mick McGeough . Drafted in 1981 by the Washington Capitals , McGeough also played for the Pittsburgh Penguins . - The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league currently composed of 31 member clubs. Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season. - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. - Regina (is the capital city of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The city is the second-largest in the province, after Saskatoon, and a cultural and commercial centre for southern Saskatchewan. It is governed by Regina City Council. The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No. 159. - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'position played on team / speciality' with 'centre'.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Lowest brightness with increased exposure Please fix the punctuation.","completion":"When attempting to capture an image or a video with the optimal quality, it is crucial to understand the dynamics of visibility and exposure. This can be achieved by using the lowest brightness setting while increasing the exposure. To begin with, the brightness setting on your device affects the visibility of the captured image or video. A lower brightness will yield a darker image, whereas a higher brightness results in more vivid colors and more light. However, higher brightness can also lead to washed-out colors and loss of detail due to overexposure. On the other hand, exposure is the duration of time the camera's sensor is exposed to light, as well as the amount of light gathered in that time period. Increasing the exposure will allow more light to reach the sensor, which can be beneficial when capturing images in dimly lit environments or situations where the subject is poorly lit. Proper exposure is crucial for obtaining an image with well-balanced colors and good contrast between the light and dark areas of the scene. In some situations, it might be advantageous to lower the brightness and increase the exposure to obtain the best results. For example, when capturing a scene with high contrast, such as a sunset or a brightly lit stage on a dark night, using a combination of low brightness and increased exposure will allow you to achieve a balance between the brightest and darkest areas of the scene. This results in a more detailed and visually pleasing image, as the shadows and highlights retain their respective details, and the colors appear more true-to-life—neither too dark nor blown out. To achieve the perfect balance of brightness and exposure, you can follow these steps: 1. Access the camera settings on your device. Most smartphones and cameras have manual controls that allow you to tweak various settings, including brightness and exposure. 2. Lower the brightness setting on your device. This will help to prevent overexposed or washed-out images due to excessive lighting. 3. Increase the exposure time. Find the optimal exposure setting that will allow you to capture the scene with the right balance of light and shadows. Keep in mind that increasing the exposure time might result in motion blur if your subject is moving or if the camera is not steady. Using a tripod or a stable surface is recommended in such cases. 4. Adjust the ISO sensitivity if needed. Along with brightness and exposure settings, you may also need to experiment with the ISO sensitivity of your device to adjust the decision-making process of your device's sensor while taking in more or less light. 5. Take a test shot and assess the results. You may need to make a series of minor adjustments until you achieve your desired image quality. Be patient and experiment with different settings to see which combination works best for the particular scene you are capturing. In conclusion, the combination of the lowest brightness setting along with increased exposure can help you capture images and videos with a more balanced and detailed appearance. Carefully adjusting these settings will enable you to take advantage of all the nuances in the scene and produce an image that reflects the desired level of detail, contrast, and vibrancy."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Given the following context: The seabed contains enormous reserves of minerals which can be exploited by dredging. This has advantages over land-based mining in that equipment can be built at specialised shipyards and infrastructure costs are lower. Disadvantages include problems caused by waves and tides, the tendency for excavations to silt up and the washing away of spoil heaps. There is a risk of coastal erosion and environmental damage. Seafloor massive sulphide deposits are potential sources of silver, gold, copper, lead and zinc and trace metals since their discovery in the 1960s.

Small scale mining of the deep sea floor is being developed off the coast of Papua New Guinea using robotic techniques, but the obstacles are formidable.There are large deposits of petroleum, as oil and natural gas, in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore oil and gas production can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment.

Write an article based on this summary: – After years of intrigue, researchers are celebrating \\"a major step forward\\" for the male birth control pill. A month-long clinical trial shows a once-daily male pill is safe and effective at suppressing the hormones needed for sperm production, and has no negative effect on sex drive, according to researchers who presented their findings Sunday at the Endocrine Society's annual conference in Chicago, per the Telegraph. The hormone pill, dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU), overcomes issues that plagued earlier versions of the male contraceptive. In addition to concerns about how low testosterone would affect sex drive, researchers feared the pill would need to be taken twice daily, given the speed that hormones clear the male body, reports the Guardian. DMAU, however, contains fatty acid undecanoate which is believed to slow the clearance. Some 100 men aged 18 to 50 received a placebo or varying doses (100mg, 200mg, or 400mg) of the pill, which contains an androgen and a progestin and must be taken with food. After 28 days, all pill-popping patients saw low testosterone levels, while patients given the 400mg dose saw a \\"marked suppression\\" in testosterone and two other hormones needed for sperm production, reports the Telegraph. Patients also saw mild weight gain and a slight drop in HDL or \\"good cholesterol\\" levels, per NBC News. But \\"very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess,\\" and liver and kidney function remained healthy, senior researcher Stephanie Page says in a release. \\"These promising results are unprecedented in the development of a prototype male pill.\\" Research will now focus on effects over longer periods. (Another male pill might leave hormones alone.)","completion":"Once upon a time, in a science lab far away, some smart researchers wanted to help men share the responsibility of having babies. They thought, \\"Why should women be the only ones to take a pill?\\" So they worked very hard and discovered a new kind of pill that men can take to help them control when they want to have a baby. This magic pill is called DMAU. It's a really special pill because it doesn't have some of the problems that made the other pills not work well. The researchers wanted to make sure DMAU wouldn't make men feel less like themselves or have to take it many times a day, so they figured out how to make it last longer and not change their feelings. They shared their exciting discoveries in a big city called Chicago, where lots of other smart people were learning new things too. They told everyone how they had a group of 100 men try the pill and how it made their special baby-making hormones go on a little vacation. Some of the men gained a little bit of weight and had a tiny change in their blood that helps their hearts, but overall they felt just fine. The researchers even noticed that their bodies still worked well inside. Now, the scientists want to keep learning about this magic pill and how it can be a big helper for men and women who want to decide when to have a baby. They will keep testing the pill to make sure it works and is safe in the long run. Everyone is very excited about this new discovery, and they think it could be a big step forward for families everywhere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Their manager prostitutes the beautiful Gong-gil to rich customers, and Jang-saeng sickens of this practice. After Gonggil kills the manager in defense of Jang-saeng, the pair flees to Seoul, where they form a new group with three other street performers.Together the group comes up with a skit mocking some members of the Royal Court, including the king and his new concubine Jang Noksu. After they are arrested for treason, Jang-saeng makes a deal with Choseon, who turns out to be one of the King's servants, to either make the king laugh at their skit or to be executed. They perform their skit for the king, but the three minor performers are too terrified to perform well. Gong-gil and Jang-saeng barely save themselves with one last joke at the king, who laughs and then makes them part of his Court. The King falls for the effeminate Gong-gil, whom he calls to his private chambers often to perform finger puppet shows. Jang-saeng becomes jealous of this relationship. Meanwhile, the King becomes more and more unstable. He makes the clowns perform a skit depicting how his mother, the favorite concubine of the former king, was forced to take poison after being betrayed by other jealous concubines. The King then slaughters these concubines at the end of the play. Jangs-aeng asks Gong-gil to leave with him and the gang at once before the King kills them too during one of his homicidal fits.

Welcome to CNN Reset, a new feature revisiting news that's been unforgettable. Here's the latest on video and online. Oklahoma twister. Science calls it an EF5. The people of Moore, Oklahoma, know it as the most powerful category of tornadoes. The twister's destruction was merciless: it struck the Plaza Towers Elementary School, killing seven children there. In all, 24 people perished, including 10 children. The human response to the catastrophe has been powerful too. Locals call it the \\"Oklahoma standard\\" -- \\"persistence and a great positive attitude by the people to never give in,\\" as University of Oklahoma football coach Bob Stoops puts it. Cleveland captivity. It was a horror worthy of Stephen King's imagination: three young women allegedly held captive in a house for roughly 10 years beginning at ages 21, 16 and 14. They were allegedly abducted off the street in a Cleveland neighborhood by the homeowner, Ariel Castro, 52, who's now facing four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape. Alleged violence and threats made the captive women afraid to seek an escape. But one of the women -- the one who bore a child by Castro -- finally shouted for help after Castro left the house and forgot to lock a big inside door. Neighbors responded. The women and a 6-year-old girl were freed. Now tourists visit the neighborhood. And as the city seeks donations to support the women, it struggles with a dark legacy. Texas explosion. The explosion of a fertilizer plant shook the Earth like an earthquake. In fact, the blast in West, Texas, registered a 2.1 on the Richter scale, and people felt it 50 miles away. The first responders experienced a scene for which no training could ever prepare them: a mushroom-cloud fireball lay waste to 37 blocks, including a nursing home, the local high and middle school, and many houses. Fifteen people -- including 12 first responders -- were killed. Volunteer firefighter Robert Payne was blown out of his boots and knocked senseless. He woke up in intensive care wondering what happened. Now recovering from several injuries, he's thankful he's alive. As the town of 2,800 rebuilds, will it want the fertilizer plant back?

Now they are together in recovery: Each brother lost a right leg in the attack. As hard as the limb loss was for the brothers, equally difficult was not seeing other each for weeks as they underwent 12 surgeries in all. The siblings finally saw each other about two weeks ago for the first time since the marathon. They want the public to know their uncommon brotherhood is lifting them through an arduous recuperation. London slaying. The British soldier was well-liked by many. He was even a military recruiter and played the drum outside the Royal Palaces on behalf of his regiment, the Fusiliers. But the life of Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, came to a grisly end on a London street at the hands of a man with a meat cleaver and knife. What has shocked the world is how the alleged attacker -- Michael Adebolajo, 28, a British national of Nigerian descent -- made a video of the gory scene and spoke to the camera about the killing, saying it was \\"an eye for an eye\\" and \\"because Muslims are dying daily.\\" A total of five men have been arrested in the slaying. Now far-right activists are calling upon Muslims to leave the country. Capital calamities.

Answer the following question: This article: Up to c. 1210, continental Arthurian romance was expressed primarily through poetry; after this date the tales began to be told in prose. The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art. contains an answer for the question: What are the two names for the Middle French prose work that made up half of the entire Lancelot-Grail Cycle?, what is it ?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: If the planet's orbit and tilt causes seasons, then what causes a planet's seasons? Answer choices: - motion - clouds - cold - climate - temperature - orbit - gravity - wind Answer:","completion":"A planet's seasons are primarily caused by two major factors, which are its orbit and axial tilt. To understand this more deeply, let's analyze the different answer choices and narrow down the options: 1. Motion: While a planet's motion plays a role in the development and the transition of its seasons, it is not the primary cause. Motion refers to the way a planet moves through space, but it's actually the orbit and axial tilt that create the variations in solar insolation, causing the formation of seasons. 2. Clouds: Clouds are an atmospheric component that helps regulate a planet's temperature. Although they can influence weather patterns and contribute to regional climates, they do not create seasons on a planetary scale. 3. Cold: Cold is a characteristic feature of certain seasons, typically winter, but it is not the cause of seasons. Cold temperatures are a result of the season itself, rather than the cause. 4. Climate: Climate pertains to long-term average weather conditions in a region. While regional climates are determined by several factors, including latitude, altitude, and proximity to large bodies of water, the seasonal cycle of the entire planet is not primarily driven by climate. 5. Temperature: Temperature is another factor that can characterize different seasons, but it is not the main cause of seasons. Instead, temperature changes are a result of the Earth's orbit and axial tilt. 6. Orbit: The orbit of a planet plays a critical role in the formation of seasons. As the planet orbits around its star, the distance between the planet and the star varies, resulting in varying levels of solar insolation. This variation, combined with the axial tilt of the planet, creates seasons. 7. Gravity: Gravity, while responsible for maintaining a planet's orbit and the tides, does not directly cause the formation of seasons. Its role is limited to keeping the planet on its orbital path. 8. Wind: Although wind can have a noteworthy impact on local and regional weather patterns, it does not cause the seasons on a planetary scale. In conclusion, the primary cause of a planet's seasons is a combination of its orbit and axial tilt. These two factors together determine the variations in solar insolation received at different parts of the planet over the course of its orbit, thus creating the seasons. While other options like motion, clouds, cold, climate, temperature, gravity, and wind can affect climate and weather patterns, they do not primarily cause the formation of a planet's seasons."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords. - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - The peso (meaning \\"weight\\" in Spanish, or more loosely \\"pound\\") was a coin that originated in Spain and became of immense importance internationally. \\"Peso\\" is now the name of the monetary unit of several former Spanish colonies. - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. - Mestizo (Peninsular Spanish: , Latin American Spanish, Philippine Spanish: ) is a term traditionally used in Spain and Spanish America to mean a person of combined European and Amerindian descent, or someone who would have been deemed a Castizo (one European parent and one Mestizo parent) regardless if the person was born in Latin America or elsewhere. The term was used as an ethnic/racial category in the casta system that was in use during the Spanish Empire's control of their New World colonies. Mestizos are usually considered to be mixed Spaniards by the crown of Spain. - Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a particular country or socio-economic context, or is easily converted to such a form. The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, sometimes, a standard of deferred payment. Any item or verifiable record that fulfills these functions can be considered as money. - A medium of exchange is an intermediary used in trade to avoid the inconveniences of a pure barter system. - A coin is a small, flat, round piece of metal or plastic used primarily as a medium of exchange or legal tender.

Financial centres around the world function as anchors of trading between a wide range of multiple types of buyers and sellers around the clock, with the exception of weekends. The foreign exchange market does not determine the relative values of different currencies, but sets the current market price of the value of one currency as demanded against another. - A banknote (often known as a bill, paper money, or simply a note) is a type of negotiable instrument known as a promissory note, made by a bank, payable to the bearer on demand. Banknotes were originally issued by commercial banks, who were legally required to redeem the notes for legal tender (usually gold or silver coin) when presented to the chief cashier of the originating bank. These commercial banknotes only traded at face value in the market served by the issuing bank. Commercial banknotes have primarily been replaced by national banknotes issued by central banks. - A currency (from , \\"in circulation\\", from ) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a \\"system of money\\" (monetary units) in common use, especially in a nation. Under this definition, US dollars, British pounds, Australian dollars, and European euros are examples of currency. These various currencies are recognized stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies. Currencies in this sense are defined by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance. - Central America is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with South America on the southeast.

Information: - Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - \\"These Eyes\\" is a song by the Canadian rock band The Guess Who. The song was co-written by the group's lead guitarist Randy Bachman and lead singer Burton Cummings and originally included on the band's 1969 album \\"Wheatfield Soul\\". It was first released as a single (backed by \\"Lightfoot\\"), in their native Canada, where its chart success (#7), along with the influence of CKLW-AM Windsor's radio station music director Rosalie Trombley, helped land them a U.S. distribution deal with RCA Records. It was then released in the U.S. In March 1969, and became a breakthrough success for the group, as it would be their first single to reach the top ten on the \\"Billboard\\" Pop Singles chart, peaking at number six, and would eventually be certified gold by the RIAA for sales of over one million copies. While it was actually the 18th single released by the band, it was the first from the quartet of Cummings, Bachman, Jim Kale, and Garry Peterson as produced by Jack Richardson. - BachmanTurner Overdrive is a Canadian rock group from Winnipeg, Manitoba, that had a series of hit albums and singles in the 1970s, selling over 7 million albums in that decade alone. Their 1970s catalogue included five Top 40 albums and six US Top 40 singles (ten in Canada). The band has sold nearly 30 million albums worldwide, and has fans affectionately known as \\"gearheads\\" (derived from the band's gear-shaped logo). Many of their songs, including \\"Let It Ride\\", \\"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\\", \\"Takin' Care of Business\\", \\"Hey You\\" and \\"Roll On Down the Highway\\", still receive play on classic-rock stations. - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. - The Guess Who is a Canadian rock band, formed in Winnipeg in 1965.

The band has continued to perform and record to the present day; and at various times has included many well-known musicians, including Burton Cummings and Randy Bachman (of BachmanTurner Overdrive). Formed as a garage rock band, their musical style encompassed the pop rock and psychedelic rock genres. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - Share the Land is the eighth studio album by Canadian rock band The Guess Who. After the departure of Randy Bachman, the band brought in two guitarists, Kurt Winter and Greg Leskiw. - Power in the Music is the fourteenth and final studio album by the Canadian rock band The Guess Who to feature Burton Cummings on lead vocals and band leader . The album was released in remastered form by the Iconoclassic label including two bonus tracks .

It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music. - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry.

The voices of Tunis and Tahrir Square, the uprising in Benghazi, the street protests in Yemen and Bahrain promised a popular awakening in countries where politics had been confined to an elite. The Western democracies -- if a little hesitantly -- took the side of the demonstrators. But with the exception of Libya, their contribution to the Arab world's new beginning comprised moral support and the promise of financial help once new governments were formed. The U.S. used some of its substantial political clout in the region to ease Hosni Mubarak and Zine El Abedine Ben Ali out of power in Egypt and Tunisia respectively. \\"Soft power\\" -- advice, mediation, persuasion and some aid -- was leveraged to influence events; the use of \\"hard power\\" as in Iraq was not even contemplated. In Egypt, the generals' long relationship with their OPTIONS: - Arab counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Arab Spring counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Bahrain counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Ben Ali counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Benghazi counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - CNN counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Egypt counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Hosni Mubarak counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Iraq counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Libya counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Obama counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Tahrir Square counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Tunis counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Tunisia counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - U.S. counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - West counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Western counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Yemen counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Zine El Abedine counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - post-Gadhafi counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past.","completion":"- U.S. counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past.

We want to make sure the dough doesn't grow too much outside of the flowerpot. Solution 1 suggests we put a heavy object on top of the dough. While it might stop the dough from growing out of the pot, it could also squish the dough down and not let it grow nicely and fluffy inside the pot. Solution 2 recommends using a lid with holes. This allows the dough to breathe and grow nicely inside the flowerpot. If it tries to grow out of the pot, the lid will help keep it in place, but still let air in through the holes.

What kind of thing would answer this question?","completion":"A soccer goalie is permitted to handle the ball within a specific area known as the penalty area or the 18-yard box. To answer this question in detail, we will first describe the dimensions and markings of the penalty area and then discuss the restrictions imposed on goalkeepers regarding handling the ball. The penalty area is a rectangular zone that extends 18 yards (16.5 meters) from each goalpost along the goal line and stretches 18 yards into the field, perpendicularly from the goal line. This creates a box that is 44 yards (40.3 meters) wide and 18 yards deep. At the corners of the penalty area, arcs with a radius of 1 yard (0.9 meters) are drawn to create the penalty arc. Also, inside the penalty area, 12 yards (11 meters) from the center of the goal line and parallel to it, there is a penalty spot where penalty kicks are taken. A soccer goalie can handle the ball within the penalty area using any part of their hands or arms. Handling the ball outside of this area can result in a direct free kick or even a disciplinary action, such as a yellow or red card, depending on the circumstances. The handling restrictions apply not only in live play but also during dead-ball situations, such as goal kicks, corner kicks, and free kicks. However, there are a few more rules and restrictions concerning the handling of the ball by goalkeepers: 1. Once the goalkeeper has released the ball from their hands, they cannot handle it again until it has been touched by another player, either a teammate or an opponent. 2. When receiving a deliberate pass-back from a teammate using their feet, the goalkeeper is not permitted to handle the ball. This would result in an indirect free kick for the opposing team from the spot where the goalkeeper touched the ball. 3. The goalkeeper must release the ball within six seconds of gaining control. Holding the ball for a longer period can result in an indirect free kick for the opposing team. 4. If a goalkeeper handles the ball after making contact with it through a throw-in directly from their teammate, it results in an indirect free kick for the opposing team. So, to sum up, a soccer goalie must stand within the penalty area to be permitted to handle the ball, following the additional rules and restrictions stated above. Knowledge of these rules and the dimensions of the penalty area can be crucial for goalkeepers to perform effectively and avoid conceding unnecessary fouls or disciplinary actions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Mark David Chapman (born May 10, 1955) is an American murderer who shot and killed John Lennon at the entrance to the Dakota apartment building in New York City on December 8, 1980. Chapman fired five times at Lennon, hitting him four times in the back, and read The Catcher in the Rye until he was arrested by police. He has repeatedly said that the novel was his statement. Chapman's legal team intended to mount an insanity defense that would be based on expert testimony that he was in a delusional psychotic state at the time of the killing. Context: Chapman's first court-appointed lawyer, Herbert Adlerberg, withdrew from the case amid threats of lynching. Police feared that Lennon fans might storm the hospital, so they transferred Chapman to Rikers Island for his personal safety. At the initial hearing in January 1981, Chapman's new lawyer, Jonathan Marks, instructed him to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. In February, Chapman sent a handwritten statement to The New York Times urging everyone to read The Catcher in the Rye, calling it an \\"extraordinary book that holds many answers.\\" The defense team sought to establish witnesses as to Chapman's mental state at the time of the killing. It was reported they were confident he would be found not guilty by reason of insanity, in which case he would have been committed to a state mental hospital and received treatment. However, in June, Chapman told Marks that he wanted to drop the insanity defense and plead guilty. Marks objected with \\"serious questions\\" over Chapman's sanity, and legally challenged his competence to make this decision. In the pursuant hearing on June 22, Chapman said that God had told him to plead guilty and that he would not change his plea or ever appeal, regardless of his sentence. Marks told the court that he opposed Chapman's change of plea but that Chapman would not listen to him. Judge Dennis Edwards refused a further assessment, saying that Chapman had made the decision of his own free will, and declared him competent to plead guilty. Question: Why did he want to change to a guilty plea?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Mark David Chapman wanted to change his plea to guilty because he claimed that God told him to do so. He believed that by pleading guilty, he was following what God wanted for him. It's important to remember that at the time, there were concerns about his mental state, and his decision to change the plea was likely influenced by his mental condition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He lets her in to the hall, and Shanks tears off the police crime scene tape that had been left there. After they get inside, someone comes to fit her ankle bracelet, and they tell her she cannot move more than 100 feet from the detector in the hallway. Shanks treats Marnie quite badly, telling her she will remain in the house until her sentence is up. He tells her to clean up some blood from the wall, and that she will have lots of time to think about what she did. Marnie argues with him, telling him that if the police had taken her crime reports seriously, her husband would still be alive today. The cynical Shanks leaves with indifference.Later that day, Marnie takes all of her husband's pictures, and belongings, and puts them in her basement, where the detector goes off. She then paints over the blood in the wall. She calls the power company about having her power restored, and they tell her they can't make it until Monday, so she has to light some candles.

The body contains marks of many needle insertions and burns from sulfuric acid, which appear to have been inflicted while the child was still alive. Five years later, Claudia is still unable to get over the death of her child and she is addicted to tranquiliizers. Inexplicably, the presumed dead daughter Angela calls her mother, saying that she is still alive and needs her help. After visiting a now-deserted clinic where she used to take her daughter (she has footage of it on a home video of herself and Angela), and finding strange pictures of angels there, Claudia calls a recently retired cop, Massera (Karra Elejalde), to investigate the matter. She also gives him a boot she found on the site, believing it to have been left for her to find. Massera's research appears to corroborate the hypothesis that Angela is alive, revealing that a girl with similar characteristics disappeared around the same time and could have been used to fake Angela's death. He teams up with tabloid journalist Quiroga (Tristan Ulloa), a reporter for a magazine of parapsychology, after Quiroga receives in the mail a disturbing videotape which has Claudia's phone number written on the label. The tape shows what appears to be the murder or torture of a naked woman, and also footage of Claudia when she visited the derelict clinic. Visiting a theological expert at the university, the two begin to uncover a bizarre cult called The Nameless that is said to sacrifice children. The cult was led by a now-imprisoned man called Santini who believed in absolute evil, and created his cult which also links to Germany's Thule Society.

The supergroup they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album Mer de Noms in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled Thirteenth Step, a reference to twelve-step programs (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery). Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, eMOTIVe, was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles \\"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums\\"—a song inspired by \\"Pet\\" that was originally released on Thirteenth Step—and \\"Passive\\". Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he \\"tested the waters\\" and was subsequently \\"crucified\\" for it because of the content. It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled aMOTION, which was certified platinum within a month of its release. Howerdel reported in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being. After more than two years since the band's last release, Keenan was asked about the status of A Perfect Circle during an interview with Revolver. He stated: The real problem with running Tool and A Perfect Circle at the same time was they both operate the same way. They're both live touring bands with a label, still working under the old contract mentality. So I thought it was time to let A Perfect Circle go for now and let Billy explore himself. It's tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech [for Tool] to being in a band with a pretentious, famous singer and having to live in that shadow. It was important for Billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own, and then we'll get back and do some A Perfect Circle stuff. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The two people who formed the supergroup A Perfect Circle are Maynard James Keenan and Billy Howerdel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It then asks what else may increase when a plant grows, providing a list of options. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options - Kinetic energy: This is energy of motion and is not directly related to plant growth. - Genetic diversity: This refers to the variety of genes within a population, not an individual plant growth process. - Activation energy: This is the energy required for a chemical reaction to occur, not specifically related to plant growth. - Stamina: This term is related to the endurance of animals, not plants. - Bloom time: While this may be affected by plant growth, the question specifically linked photosynthesis to growth, making it a stronger answer. - Nutrients: Although important for plant growth, the question specifically links photosynthesis to growth. - Gene flow: This is the transfer of genetic information from one population to another, not specifically related to an individual plant's growth. Step 3: Justify the chosen answer Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into sugars, which provide energy for growth. As a plant grows, the surface area of its leaves may increase, allowing it to capture more sunlight and carry out more photosynthesis. Therefore, the most relevant answer is photosynthesis, as it is directly stated to increase when a plant grows."},{"prompt":"Given the below context: Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904.

Summarize this article: (CNN) A feud with the first lady's office cost a senior national security adviser her job in the White House after she sparred with East Wing staff and other key members of the Trump administration. The dispute spilled into public view in extraordinary fashion on Tuesday when the first lady's office released a statement calling for deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel's ouster as reports surfaced that President Donald Trump would fire the official. \\"It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that (Ricardel) no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\\" the first lady's communications director Stephanie Grisham said in a statement on Tuesday. The White House announced Wednesday that Ricardel would be leaving her role as deputy national security adviser and would take a different role in the administration. The statement Tuesday from Melania Trump's office amounted to a stunning public rebuke by a first lady of a senior official serving in her husband's administration. It came after reports surfaced earlier Tuesday indicating Ricardel would be pushed out of her post after less than seven months on the job. Neither Ricardel nor spokespeople for the National Security Council responded to CNN requests for comment. Reflecting the fast-moving nature of the events, soon after a Wall Street Journal report surfaced Tuesday afternoon alleging Ricardel was fired and escorted off the White House grounds, a senior White House official denied the story to reporters. The official said Ricardel was still in her office Tuesday afternoon. Her departure leaves national security adviser John Bolton without one of his key allies in the White House, a deputy who has also shared his penchant for bureaucratic infighting. It was those sharp elbows that sources said led to the first lady's stinging statement, with Ricardel most recently feuding with members of the first lady's staff over her trip to Africa. One person familiar with the matter said Ricardel quarreled with the first lady's staff over seating on the plane and use of National Security Council resources. A White House official accused Ricardel of being dishonest about the feud and subsequently leaking stories to try to cover her behavior. And before her spat with the East Wing, Ricardel butted heads repeatedly with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a rivalry that was well-known within the Trump administration. Her disputes with Mattis preceded her time as deputy national security adviser, going back to the presidential transition when Ricardel sought to block Mattis from hiring certain people who had been critical of Trump or were viewed as insufficiently loyal to Trump. Tensions had also been rising between Ricardel and chief of staff John Kelly and his deputy Zach Fuentes in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. Kelly and Fuentes believe Ricardel was leaking negative stories about them to the press, the people said. The dispute made it difficult for Ricardel to land in a top post in the Trump administration, though she was ultimately tapped for the position of undersecretary of commerce for export administration. Ricardel then joined the National Security Council as Bolton's deputy in April after he was named national security adviser. Ricardel has been key to Bolton's efforts to restructure the National Security Council and to help Bolton secure his place as an influential adviser to the President on all foreign policy matters. The drama surrounding Ricardel's ouster surfaced while Bolton was half a world away in Singapore, where he is attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit. West Wing caught off guard West Wing officials were caught off guard on Tuesday by the statement from the first lady's spokeswoman targeting Ricardel, two sources familiar with the matter said. White House officials were generally aware of the tensions between Ricardel and the first lady's office stemming from the Africa trip, but were stunned to see the first lady take such a public stance against a senior staffer through her spokeswoman. Sources said officials in the White House press shop were particularly annoyed that they didn't get a heads-up from the East Wing. West Wing and NSC officials are more upset at the way the East Wing handled the matter than the substance of the effort to push Ricardel out. One person said neither Trump, Kelly nor press secretary Sarah Sanders knew the statement was coming. Ricardel made few friends since she came on board in April, clashing with officials across the administration. Two administration sources said she was generally not well liked, though others pushed back, saying she was a respected member of the team and one of the highest ranking women in the West Wing. Even one NSC official who said they liked Ricardel said she \\"liked to pick fights with a lot of different folks\\" and suspected her latest feud with the first lady's office was \\"the last straw.\\" Another official was more forgiving: \\"She'd run through a brick wall for you but her personality isn't for everyone.\\" This story has been updated. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Carol E. Lee, Kristen Welker, Hallie Jackson and Courtney Kube ­ WASHINGTON — John Kelly, mired in conflicts with a widening array of officials from the National Security Council to the office of the first lady, may soon depart the Trump administration, according to seven people familiar with the discussions. Nick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, is among those being considered for the job, three of the people said, though President Donald Trump has mused about other possible candidates. Melania Trump has ensured the departure of one White House official, deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel, after she had a series of run-ins with the first lady’s office. Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s communications director, issued a pointed statement on Tuesday saying as much. “It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,” Grisham said. It’s an extraordinary, if not unprecedented, move for the first lady’s office to publicly call for the firing of a NSC official. Ricardel was seen at an official White House event with the president as Grisham's statement was was issued. Kelly’s time as chief of staff for most of the past year has been clouded by controversy and disagreements with Trump and various West Wing staff. But questions about his future in the White House recently became more serious after his repeated clashes with national security adviser John Bolton and his deputy, Ricardel. Kelly has also gotten on the wrong side of Melania Trump over staffing issues and travel requests. Some of the disputes with the East Wing have escalated to the president, the seven people familiar with the clashes said. SIGN UP FOR NBC BREAKING NEWS EMAILS \\"There have been instances where the East Wing staff were not treated as equals to the male-dominated decision makers in Chief Kelly’s office,\\" one White House official said. \\"Promotions were denied then finally granted after months of requests,\\" the official said. Melania Trump raised concerns with her husband earlier this year, amid the height of the controversy over his alleged affair with porn actress Stormy Daniels, that Kelly had repeatedly denied her requests to promote some of her aides, two White House officials told NBC News. The requests languished for months as Kelly insisted there weren’t enough available positions for the first lady’s aides to have senior titles, these people said. During this same period however, West Wing officials working for Kelly received promotions, the White House officials said. Having learned of the dispute, the president was furious and told Kelly to give the first lady, who has a smaller East Wing staff than her recent predecessors, what she wanted, these people said. \\"I don't need this shit,\\" Trump told Kelly, according to one person familiar with the conversation. Kelly wouldn’t be the first chief-of-staff to upset a first lady but history has shown that such disputes are tough to overcome. Nancy Reagan was at odds with President Ronald Reagan’s chief of staff, Donald Regan, which ultimately helped orchestrate his departure. And Hillary Clinton was at odds with President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff over her large role in policy decisions. Trump was especially annoyed, according to people familiar with his thinking, that he had to get involved in disputes involving his wife. His message to Kelly, according to one of them, repeatedly has been: \\"Deal with it.\\" The promotions of the first lady’s communications director, Grisham, and White House social secretary, Rickie Niceta, from special assistants to the president to deputy assistants to the president were ultimately cleared and announced in June. Kelly has also sparred with the East Wing over travel arrangements for the first lady’s staff, people familiar with the issue said. He often wouldn’t reserve space for Melania Trump’s two aides on Air Force One or on helicopters. They would find themselves without hotel rooms and not listed for motorcade movements. The omissions have caused last-minute logistical issues that the first lady viewed as a slight, these people said. The White House declined to comment for this story. \\"The East Wing is very focused on the First Lady’s initiatives and works independently,\\" Grisham said in a statement to NBC news. \\"However, we do collaborate on a variety of projects and work alongside many departments within the west wing. We have a very positive working relationship,\\" she said. The first lady also took issue with Kelly over the ousting in March of her director of operations, Justin Caporale, and of John McEntee, the president’s personal aide who had become close with the Trump family since working for him during the 2016 campaign, people familiar with the matter said. The first lady liked and trusted both of them, according to current and former White House officials, and viewed forcing them out \\"as personal affronts.\\" Some people close to the president believe Kelly’s handling of the East Wing at times is a significant threat to him maintaining his job. \\"There’s one problem John Kelly has that’ll do him in, and that’s the first lady,\\" one of them said. A White House official said the first lady has not pushed for his departure, noting that she likes Kelly personally and gets along with him. But tensions with her office, on top of his intensifying power struggle with Bolton, have reignited speculation that Trump will replace him before the end of the year. Last month, Kelly got into a heated argument with Bolton on immigration, ultimately storming out of the White House on Oct. 18, NBC News reported last month after learning that Bolton had criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen as doing a terrible job on border security,­ an issue of top concern to the president. Nielsen is a close Kelly confidante, and Kelly viewed Bolton’s move as the latest example of the national security adviser circumventing his authority as chief of staff. Trump has been unhappy with Nielsen for months and she has not denied reports that the president has yelled at her in private settings. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that she may also be asked to depart the administration soon. Kelly and Bolton also have clashed over Ricardel, the deputy national security adviser, four people familiar with the issue said. Bolton recently learned that Kelly has quietly mounted an effort to oust Ricardel, these people said, and was furious. Ricardel was among Bolton’s first hires when he became national security adviser in March. She previously worked for him during the administration of former president George W. Bush. But at the NSC, Ricardel has gotten into several disputes with the East Wing, also over the First Lady’s trip to Africa in October. One White House official said that in that instance, Kelly intervened on behalf of the East Wing to smooth over the issues. Some current and former White House officials and other people close to the president said it’s the accumulation of incidents in recent months, on top of Kelly’s tensions with first daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, that has led to a desire by the president to seek out a new chief of staff. Kelly is Trump’s second chief of staff, having replaced Reince Priebus just seven months into the presidency. Kelly left his position as Secretary for Homeland Security in August, 2017 and joined the White House to bring structure to a freewheeling West Wing. He curtailed access to the president and he cut back on the number of staff allowed in meetings. The efforts quickly won him enemies among the president’s confidants. John Kelly speaks to President Donald Trump as he departs the Oval Office on July 18, 2018. Tasos Katopodis / AFP - Getty Images A retired Marine general, Kelly maintained his job despite a steady flow of reports that he’s lost the confidence of much of the White House staff and has disparaged the president behind his back, NBC has reported. As conflicts have arisen, Trump has for months mused on and off about possible replacements for Kelly and vented his frustrations with his handling of the job. The president also arranged for some of his new hires this past spring, including Bolton, to report directly to him rather than his chief of staff. The White House has tried to quell speculation about Kelly’s exit, even issuing a statement in July that he would remain in the job through 2020. But few expressed confidence that would be the case. Ayers, who has worked to develop a relationship with Trump as the vice president’s chief of staff, is not the only candidate under consideration in what the three people familiar with the outreach describe as active discussions in the White House about replacing Kelly, possibly by the end of the year. The vice president’s office had no comment on the possibility of the appointment. One White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity said \\"personnel decisions don’t mean anything until formally announced by the,\\" president. \\"Regardless, Nick and those close to him have never lobbied for this.\\" Melania Trump has kept a low profile as first lady and has surrounded herself with a smaller group of aides compared to her predecessors. In a rare, wide-ranging interview with ABC News during her Africa trip, she signaled, however, that she doesn’t hold back in private about her views on her husband’s aides. There currently are members of her husband’s staff she does not trust, she said, which makes it \\"harder to govern.\\" \\"You always need to watch your back,\\" she said. ||||| WASHINGTON—President Trump is considering new high-level staff changes in his administration—including discussing a potential successor for White House Chief of Staff John Kelly—as the West Wing makes preparations for the start of the final two years of Mr. Trump’s current term.

A desperate Leah Fuller hires the three men and local Vicente Madariaga, to rescue her husband, John, who is pinned under debris from a gold mine cave-in in hostile Apache territory.

Inside their own houses, Mother and Mrs. Patrick were engaged in spring cleaning. Somehow the boys had slipped away to the back lot with their kites. Now, even at the risk of having brother caught to beat carpets, they had sent him to the kitchen for more string . It seemed there was no limit to the heights to which kites would fly today. My mother looked at the sitting room, its furniture disordered for a thorough sweeping. Again she cast a look toward the window. \\"Come on, girls! Let's take string to the boys and watch them fly the kites a minute.\\" On the way we met Mrs. Patric, laughing guiltily as if she were doing something wrong, together with her girls. There never was such a day for flying kites! We played all our fresh string into the boys' kites and they went up higher and higher. We could hardly distinguish the orange-colored spots of the kites. Now and then we slowly pulled one kite back, watching it dancing up and down in the wind, and finally bringing it down to earth, just for the joy of sending it up again. Even our fathers dropped their tools and joined us. Our mothers took their turn, laughing like schoolgirls. I think _ . Parents forgot their duty and their dignity; children forgot their everyday fights and little jealousies. \\"Perhaps it's like this in the kingdom of heaven,\\" I thought confusedly.

(CNN) One of the US Navy's newest littoral combat ships can't catch a break. In its latest mishap, the USS Montgomery, an Independence-class LCS that's been in service less than two months, sustained an 18-inch-long crack to its hull while passing through the Panama Canal en route to its homeport in San Diego. The Montgomery (LCS-8) was traveling from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean through the canal's series of \\"locks\\" when it hit a cement structure known as the \\"center lock wall\\" while under the control of a local Panama Canal pilot, according to a statement to CNN from the Navy. \\"The crack is located 8-10 feet above the waterline and poses no water intrusion or stability risk,\\" the Navy said, adding that the ship has since exited the Panama Canal to continue its trip to San Diego as scheduled.

MUST WATCH U.S. Navy tests littoral combat ship 01:23 The incident is the latest in a run of bad luck for the 360 million state-of-the-art warship since it was commissioned in September. In fact, the Montgomery experienced a separate mishap just weeks ago that also resulted in a crack to its hull. It sprang a leak after it was hit by a tug boat pulling it out of the path of Hurricane Matthew. An investigation into possible causes of that October 4 incident is under way, according to a statement that was made to CNN last month by Lt. Cmdr. Rebecca Haggard, a spokeswoman for the Naval Surface Forces Pacific. Earlier, just days after its commissioning, the Montgomery also experienced a seawater leak into the vessel's hydraulic cooling system, and then lost one of its gas turbine engines later that day. The Montgomery's Panama mishap is just the latest in a string of incidents that have dogged the LCS program. In September, the service announced a major overhaul of the LCS program that will include designating the first four of the ships as testing vessels and limiting their overseas deployments to emergencies.

It is designed to defeat asymmetric “anti-access” threats such as mines, quiet diesel submarines and fast surface craft. The LCS class consists of two variants, the Freedom variant and the Independence variant - designed and built by two industry teams. The Freedom variant team is led by Lockheed Martin (for the odd-numbered hulls, e.g. LCS 1). The Independence variant team is being led by General Dynamics, Bath Iron Works (LCS 2 and LCS 4) and Austal USA (for the subsequent even-numbered hulls). The LCS seaframes will be outfitted with reconfigurable payloads, called mission modules (made up of mission systems and support equipment), which can be changed out quickly. These modules combine with crew detachments and aviation assets to become complete mission packages, which will deploy manned and unmanned vehicles and sensors in support of mine countermeasures, anti-submarine warfare, or surface warfare missions. Initiated in February 2002, the LCS program represents a significant reduction in time to acquire, design and build ships in comparison to any previous ship class. Constructed by Lockheed Martin in the Marinette Marine Corporation's shipyard in Marinette, Wis., USS Freedom (LCS 1) was delivered to the Navy on Sept. 18, 2008. USS Independence (LCS 2) was constructed by General Dynamics, Bath Iron Works in the Austal USA shipyard in Mobile, Ala. and delivered to the Navy on Dec. 18, 2009. Lockheed Martin was also responsible for the construction and delivery of LCS 3 (USS Fort Worth, which was commissioned in September 2012) and General Dynamics for construction and delivery of LCS 4 (the future USS Coronado, which delivered Sept. 27, 2013). The Navy's LCS acquisition strategy to down select to a single design in 2010 resulted in a highly effective competition and an industry response that produced significant savings in the LCS program. These competitive bids, coupled with the Navy's desire to increase ship procurement rates to support operational requirements, created an opportunity to award both bidders a fixed-price, ten-ship block buy for a total of 20 ships from fiscal years 2010 to 2015. Contracts were awarded to Lockheed Martin and Austal USA on Dec. 29, 2010, for the construction of up to ten ships each (FY 2010 - FY 2015), beginning with LCS 5 and LCS 6. In order to bring operational issues to the forefront, collect data in real-world operational scenarios, and inform the larger LCS fleet integration strategy, the Navy decided to deploy USS Freedom (LCS 1) nearly two years early. On Feb. 16, 2010, the ship deployed to the Fourth Fleet in the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility. During this deployment, Freedom successfully conducted four drug seizures, netting more than five tons of cocaine, detained nine suspected drug smugglers, and disabled two 'go-fast' drug vessels. USS Freedom also participated in the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise during this early deployment. On March 1, 2013, USS Freedom departed on the first LCS overseas deployment, crossing the Pacific to operate in Southeast Asia out of Singapore for eight months. Marking the first of many planned rotational deployments to the Western Pacific for the LCS platform, Freedom is conducting maritime security operations with regional partners and allies. This deployment will allow the Navy to demonstrate Freedom’s operational capabilities as well as evaluate crew rotation and maintenance plans for the entire LCS class. Following her commissioning in Mobile, Ala. on Jan. 10, 2010, USS Independence continued on to her homeport in San Diego. The Navy commissioned LCS 3 on Sept. 22, 2012 in Galveston, Texas, after which she joined sister ships USS Freedom and USS Independence in homeport San Diego. Both LCS 2 and LCS 3 are conducting Post Delivery Test and Trials, which are scheduled to conclude in 2014. LCS 4 (the future USS Coronado) delivered to the Navy on Sept. 27, 2013 and is planned to commission in San Diego in April, 2014. Milwaukee (LCS 5), Detroit (LCS 7), Little Rock (LCS 9) and Sioux City (LCS 11) are under contract to Lockheed Martin and are in construction at the Marinette Marine Corp. shipyard, and Jackson (LCS 6), Montgomery (LCS 8), Gabrielle Giffords (LCS 10) and Omaha (LCS 12), are under contract to Austal USA and are in construction at the Austal USA shipyard. Wichita (LCS 13) and Billings (LCS 15) are under contract with Lockheed Martin and in the pre-production phase at Marinette Marine Corp, while Manchester (LCS 14) and Tulsa (LCS 16) are under contract with Austal USA and in the pre-production phase.

Given the question: Information: - A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. In 2015, 294 million domain names had been registered. - The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is a department of ICANN, a nonprofit private American corporation that oversees global IP address allocation, autonomous system number allocation, root zone management in the Domain Name System (DNS), media types, and other Internet Protocol-related symbols and Internet numbers. - The DNS root zone is the top-level DNS zone in the hierarchical namespace of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet. - The European Commission (EC) is an institution of the European Union, responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the EU. Commissioners swear an oath at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, pledging to respect the treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate. - Cybersquatting (also known as domain squatting), according to the United States federal law known as the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, is registering, trafficking in, or using an Internet domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price. - The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of the Internet, and has been in use since the 1980s. - EURid vzw / asbl ( European Registry for Internet Domains ) is a non-profit organisation appointed by the European Commission on 8 April 2003 as the domain name registry to operate the new . eu top - level domain . EURid is a consortium of three European ccTLD operators : DNS Belgium ( . be ) , IIT - CNR ( . it ) and NIC - SE ( . se ) . It has been established in Belgium , having its headquarters in Brussels . In October 2006 , they opened their first branch office in Stockholm . Two further branch offices have been opened in Italy and the Czech Republic . There are four associate members : the Academic and Research Network of Slovenia ( ARNES ) , the registry for . si , the national top - level domain for Slovenia , CZ.NIC , the registry for . cz , the national top - level domain for the Czech Republic , ISOC - ECC , the European chapter of the Internet Society , and BUSINESSEUROPE , a confederation of 39 industry - related federations from 33 countries . EURid uses the Extensible Provisioning Protocol ( EPP ) which enables registrars to perform operations on . eu domain names directly . The web site is available in all the official languages of the European Union : Bulgarian , Croatian , Danish , German , Czech , Estonian , English , Spanish , French , Italian , Latvian , Lithuanian , Hungarian , Dutch , Polish , Portuguese , Romanian , Slovak , Finnish , Swedish , Greek , Maltese , Irish and Slovenian . - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet. - A fully qualified domain name (FQDN), sometimes also referred to as an \\"absolute domain name\\", is a domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies all domain levels, including the top-level domain and the root zone. A fully qualified domain name is distinguished by its lack of ambiguity: it can be interpreted only in one way. - The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a nonprofit organization that is responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation. ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the central Internet address pools and DNS root zone registries pursuant to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function contract. The contract regarding the IANA stewardship functions between ICANN and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the United States Department of Commerce ended on October 1, 2016, formally transitioning the functions to the global multi-stakeholder community. - A country code top-level domain (ccTLD) is an Internet top-level domain generally used or reserved for a country, sovereign state, or dependent territory identified with a country code. - .eu is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the European Union (EU). Launched on 7 December 2005, the domain is available for organisations in and residents of EU member states. The TLD is administered by EURid, a consortium originally consisting of the national ccTLD registry operators of Belgium, Sweden, and Italy, joined later by the national registry operator of the Czech Republic. Trademark owners were able to submit registrations through a sunrise period, in an effort to prevent cybersquatting. Full registration started on 7 April 2006. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - A top-level domain (TLD) is one of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System of the Internet. The top-level domain names are installed in the root zone of the name space. For all domains in lower levels, it is the last part of the domain name, that is, the last label of a fully qualified domain name. For example, in the domain name www.example.com, the top-level domain is com. Responsibility for management of most top-level domains is delegated to specific organizations by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which operates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and is in charge of maintaining the DNS root zone. - A domain name registry is a database of all domain names and the associated registrant information in the top level domains of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet that allow third party entities to request administrative control of a domain name. Most registries operate on the top-level and second-level of the DNS. - The European Court of Justice (ECJ), officially just the Court of Justice, is the highest court in the European Union in matters of European Union law. As a part of the Court of Justice of the European Union it is tasked with interpreting EU law and ensuring its equal application across all EU member states. The Court was established in 1952 and is based in Luxembourg. It is composed of one judge per member state currently 28 although it normally hears cases in panels of three, five or 15 judges.
