The points where the circle meets the coordinate axes are (A = (r, 0)), (B = (-r, 0)), (C = (0, r)), and (D = (0, -r)). 2. **Points (P) and (Q) on the circle:** Let (P = (u, v)) and (Q = (-u, v)) be two points on the circumference of the circle. Since these points lie on the circle, they satisfy the circle's equation: [ u^2 + v^2 = r^2 ] 3. **Finding point (N):** The point (N) is the intersection of the line (PQ) with the (y)-axis. The line (PQ) is horizontal because both points have the same (y)-coordinate (v). Therefore, the line (PQ) is given by (y = v).

The rules state that each subsequent number must result from the previous one by either increasing or decreasing one of its digits by 1. 2. **Analyze the Rearrangement Rules:** - Each number can change by incrementing or decrementing one of its digits by 1. - After such a transformation, the sum of the digits of adjacent numbers must differ by 1. 3. **Sum of Digits Parity Analysis:** - Consider any number ( ab ) (where ( a ) is the tens digit and ( b ) is the units digit). The sum of the digits is ( a + b ). - If we look at the parity (odd or even nature) of this sum: - If the sum is even, it will remain even if we make an even number of transformations. - If the sum is odd, it will remain odd if we make an even number of transformations. - Therefore, the sum of the digits for any number ( ab ) must either remain consistent in its parity or differ from its initial parity. 4. **Initial Parity Distribution:** - Initially, the numbers are 00, 01, 02, ..., 99, arranged sequentially. - Checking the parity: - In the first ten numbers (00 to 09): the sums are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. - The parities alternate between even and odd. 5. **Impact of Rearrangement on Parity:** - Since adjacent numbers must have their sum of digits differing by 1, their parity must also alternate by 1. - Before rearrangement, half the numbers have even sum of digits and other half have odd sums of digits. - After rearrangement, at least half the positions will have parity changes. 6. **Estimation of Fixed Positions:** - Since with any rearrangement, at least half the numbers (50 out of 100) must change their parity, it implies that at most 50 numbers can keep the same parity in both the value and their position index. - Therefore, there can be a maximum of 50 numbers which retain their positions after rearrangement. 7. **Providing an Example:** - One possible example is to flip the sequence at regular intervals where half the numbers maintain their positions. 8. **Conclusion:** - By completing the above logical sequences, we conclude that the maximum number of numbers that can remain in their initial positions after the rearrangement is: [ boxed{50} ]"},{"prompt":"Given real numbers x and y satisfying the equation x^2 + y^2 2x + 2sqrt{3}y + 3 = 0, find the range of values for x sqrt{3}y.

This is because a circle passing through two points on ( S ) and being tangent to ( S ) is not possible. 3. **Transformation via Inversion:** - Assume point ( A ) does not lie on ( S ). - Perform an inversion with center ( A ). Inversion is a geometric transformation that takes a point ( P ) to a point ( P^* ) such that ( AP cdot AP^* = r^2 ), where ( r ) is the radius of the inversion circle centered at ( A ). 4. **Transformed Elements:** - Under this inversion, the sought circle gets transformed into a line passing through ( B^* ) (the image of ( B ) under inversion) and tangent to ( S^* ) (the image of ( S )). 5. **Constructing the Tangent:** - Draw the tangent line ( l ) from the point ( B^* ) to the circle ( S^* ). - There are three cases to consider for the position of ( B^* ) relative to ( S^* ): - If ( B^* ) lies on ( S^* ), there is only one tangent possible, hence one solution. - If ( B^* ) lies outside ( S^* ), there are two tangents possible, hence two solutions. - If ( B^* ) lies inside ( S^* ), no tangents are possible, hence no solution. 6. **Re-inversion to Original Space:** - Perform the inverse transformation to map the tangent line ( l ) back to the original space. - Under the inverse transformation, the line ( l ) passes through ( B ) and maps back to the desired circle that passes through both ( A ) and ( B ) and is tangent to ( S ). # Conclusion - If ( B^* ) lies on ( S^* ), there is one unique solution. - If ( B^* ) lies outside ( S^* ), there are two solutions. - If ( B^* ) lies inside ( S^* ), there are no solutions.

We are told that y=f(x) + x^2 is an odd function. An odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x).

Given f(1) = 1, we can use the property of the odd function to determine f(-1). Specifically, we know f(-1) + (-1)^2 = -(f(1) + 1^2). Substituting f(1) = 1 into the equation gives us f(-1) + 1 = -(1 + 1), which simplifies to f(-1) + 1 = -2. Solving for f(-1) gives us f(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3. 3.

Prove that at least one of the numbers PA, PB, PC and PD is not rational.","completion":"1. Consider a square (ABCD) inscribed in a circle (k) with center (O) and radius (r). Let (P) be an arbitrary point on the circle (k). 2. Without loss of generality, we can place the square (ABCD) in the complex plane with the center of the circle at the origin. The vertices of the square can be represented as complex numbers: [ A = r, quad B = -r, quad C = ir, quad D = -ir ] where (i) is the imaginary unit. 3. Let (P) be represented as (P = re^{itheta}) for some angle (theta). 4. We need to show that at least one of the distances (PA, PB, PC,) or (PD) is not rational. The distances can be calculated as follows: [ PA = |P - A| = |re^{itheta} - r| = r|e^{itheta} - 1| ] [ PB = |P - B| = |re^{itheta} + r| = r|e^{itheta} + 1| ] [ PC = |P - C| = |re^{itheta} - ir| = r|e^{itheta} - i| ] [ PD = |P - D| = |re^{itheta} + ir| = r|e^{itheta} + i| ] 5. Using Euler's formula (e^{itheta} = costheta + isintheta), we can rewrite the distances: [ PA = r|(costheta + isintheta) - 1| = rsqrt{(costheta - 1)^2 + sin^2theta} = 2r|sin(theta/2)| ] [ PB = r|(costheta + isintheta) + 1| = rsqrt{(costheta + 1)^2 + sin^2theta} = 2r|cos(theta/2)| ] [ PC = r|(costheta + isintheta) - i| = rsqrt{cos^2theta + (sintheta - 1)^2} = 2r|sin(pi/4 - theta/2)| ] [ PD = r|(costheta + isintheta) + i| = rsqrt{cos^2theta + (sintheta + 1)^2} = 2r|cos(pi/4 - theta/2)| ] 6. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that all the distances (PA, PB, PC,) and (PD) are rational. This implies that (2r|sin(theta/2)|), (2r|cos(theta/2)|), (2r|sin(pi/4 - theta/2)|), and (2r|cos(pi/4 - theta/2)|) are all rational. 7. Since (r) is a non-zero constant, it follows that (|sin(theta/2)|), (|cos(theta/2)|), (|sin(pi/4 - theta/2)|), and (|cos(pi/4 - theta/2)|) must all be rational. 8. However, it is known that the sine and cosine of a rational multiple of (pi) are transcendental unless the angle is a rational multiple of (pi/2). Therefore, it is impossible for all these trigonometric values to be rational simultaneously. 9. This contradiction implies that our assumption that all distances are rational is false. Hence, at least one of the distances (PA, PB, PC,) or (PD) must be irrational. (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"An element is randomly chosen from among the first 20 rows of Pascal's Triangle.

Hence, ( C_1H ) is perpendicular to ( PC_2 ). By similar reasoning, the Euler lines of the other triangles ( triangle BPC ) and ( triangle CPA ) will also intersect at the midpoints of their respective chords. 6. **Intersection at a common point**: As ( P, A_2, B_2, C_2 ) lie on one circle, the perpendicular bisectors of ( PC_2, PB_2, PA_2 ), which are the Euler lines of the respective triangles, will intersect at the center of this circle, by the result of Problem 161, implying that these three Euler lines intersect at one common point. **Conclusion:** Thus, we have proven that the Euler lines of the triangles ( triangle APB ), ( triangle BPC ), and ( triangle CPA ) intersect at a single point, which is the circumcenter of the cyclic quadrilateral formed by points ( P, A_2, B_2, C_2 ).

Prove that the numbers b, b+n, b+2n, ldots, b+(n1)n give all possible remainders modulo m.","completion":"To prove that the numbers ( b, b + n, b + 2n, ldots, b + (n-1)n ) cover all possible remainders modulo ( m ), we need to show that each of the integers modulo ( m ) appears exactly once among the remainders when these numbers are divided by ( m ). 1. **Basic Setup and Definitions**: Let ( m ) and ( n ) be coprime integers (i.e., ( gcd(m, n) = 1 )), and let ( b ) be any integer. Consider the sequence: [ b, b + n, b + 2n, ldots, b + (n-1)n ] We aim to show that the remainders of these numbers when divided by ( m ) are distinct and span all possible remainders ( 0, 1, 2, ldots, m-1 ). 2. **Remainders Modulo ( m )**: The remainders when these numbers are divided by ( m ) are given by: [ b mod m, (b + n) mod m, (b + 2n) mod m, ldots, (b + (n-1)n) mod m ] Let ( r_i ) denote the remainder of ( b + in ) modulo ( m ). Hence: [ r_i = (b + in) mod m quad text{for} quad i = 0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ] 3. **Distinctness of the Remainders**: Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that two different indices ( i ) and ( j ) yield the same remainder modulo ( m ). Thus, assume ( r_i = r_j ). This implies: [ (b + in) mod m = (b + jn) mod m ] Simplifying this within the equivalence classes modulo ( m ), we get: [ (b + in) equiv (b + jn) mod m ] Subtracting ( b ) from both sides, we find: [ in equiv jn mod m ] Since ( gcd(m, n) = 1 ), we can cancel ( n ) from both sides of the congruence (this is a consequence of a theorem stating that if a and b are coprime, then ( a ) can be canceled in modular arithmetic): [ i equiv j mod m ] Since ( i ) and ( j ) are both between ( 0 ) and ( n-1 ), the only way ( i equiv j mod m ) is if ( i = j ). 4. **Completion of the Proof**: Since ( i ) and ( j ) must be equal for their remainders to be equal, the remainders ( r_i ) for ( i = 0, 1, 2, ldots, (n-1) ) must all be distinct modulo ( m ). 5. **Counting the Remainders**: The sequence has exactly ( n ) terms. Since any number modulo ( m ) can yield ( m ) possible remainders, and ( n ) distinct remainders are taken modulo ( m ), and given ( m ) and ( n ) are coprime, the ( n ) remainders span all equivalence classes modulo ( m ). 6. **Conclusion**: Thus, the sequence ( b, b + n, b + 2n, ldots, b + (n-1)n ) provides all possible remainders modulo ( m ).

Given the functional equation for ( f: mathbb{R}_{+} to mathbb{R} ): [ f(x) f(y) = y^a fleft( frac{x}{2} right) + x^b fleft( frac{y}{2} right) ] 2. We start by noting that the left-hand side of the equation, ( f(x) f(y) ), is symmetric in ( x ) and ( y ). Thus, the right-hand side must be symmetric as well: [ y^a fleft( frac{x}{2} right) + x^b fleft( frac{y}{2} right) = x^a fleft( frac{y}{2} right) + y^b fleft( frac{x}{2} right) ] 3. For the above equality to hold for all positive real numbers ( x ) and ( y ), we can deduce that if ( a neq b ), there must exist a constant ( c ) such that: [ frac{fleft( frac{x}{2} right)}{x^a - x^b} = c ] for all ( x neq 0, 1 ). This implies that: [ f(x) = c left( 2^a x^a - 2^b x^b right) ] for all ( x > 0 ), except ( x neq frac{1}{2} ) and ( x neq 1 ). 4. Substituting this expression back into the original functional equation, we get: [ c^2 left( 2^a x^a - 2^b x^b right) left( 2^a y^a - 2^b y^b right) = c left( y^a x^a - y^b x^b right) ] 5. Rearranging and simplifying, we have: [ c^2 left( 2^a x^a - 2^b x^b right) left( 2^a y^a - 2^b y^b right) - c left( y^a x^a - y^b x^b right) = 0 ] 6. Treating this as a polynomial in ( x ), the coefficients of the same degree must be equal on both sides. From the term in ( x^a ), we get: [ c^2 2^a left( 2^a y^a - 2^b y^b right) = c y^a ] 7. Examining the coefficient of ( y^b ), we find ( c = 0 ), hence ( f = 0 ) on ( mathbb{R}^{*} setminus { frac{1}{2}, 1 } ). 8. Injecting ( x = y = frac{1}{2} ) into the original equation, we find ( fleft( frac{1}{2} right) = 0 ). Then by setting ( x = y = 1 ), we get ( f(1) = 0 ). Thus, the function ( f ) is the zero function, which is a valid solution to the problem. 9. Next, consider the case ( a = b ). By setting ( x = y ) in the original equation, we get: [ f(x)^2 = 2 x^a fleft( frac{x}{2} right) ] Since ( fleft( frac{x}{2} right) ) is non-negative for all ( x ), ( f ) must never take strictly negative values. Therefore: [ f(x) = sqrt{2 x^a fleft( frac{x}{2} right)} ] 10. Substituting this back into the initial equation, we have: [ 4 x^a fleft( frac{x}{2} right) y^a fleft( frac{y}{2} right) = x^{2a} fleft( frac{y}{2} right)^2 + y^{2a} fleft( frac{x}{2} right)^2 ] Factoring, we get: [ left( x^a fleft( frac{y}{2} right) - y^a fleft( frac{x}{2} right) right)^2 = 0 ] This implies that the ratio ( frac{fleft( frac{x}{2} right)}{x^a} ) is constant for ( x neq 0 ). Hence: [ f(x) = c x^a ] for some constant ( c in mathbb{R} ). This holds true even at ( x = 0 ), as setting ( x = y = 0 ) in the original equation gives ( f(0) = 0 ). 11. Therefore, we conclude that the functions satisfying the given functional equation are: [ f(x) = c x^a ] and [ f(x) = 0 ] Both these forms satisfy the initial condition.

Therefore, all smaller triangles have equal areas. 2. **Checking the Other Options**: - **Similarity or Congruency (Options A and B)**: While the triangles share some congruent angles, they do not generally share all corresponding angles and side ratios necessary for similarity or congruence across all pairs. - **Formation of Similar Quadrilaterals (Option D)**: No specific quadrilaterals with guaranteed similarity are formed by the mere fact of P being the centroid in an equilateral triangle. 3. **Conclusion**: - The correct statement about the triangles is that they all have equal areas.

A number ( m ) is \\"good\\" if there exist integers ( a, b, c ) such that ( m = a^3 + 2b^3 + 4c^3 - 6abc ). 2. **Thue's Theorem:** We use a three-variable version of Thue's theorem. The theorem states that for any prime ( p ) and integers ( a, b, c ) at most ( p-1 ), there exist integers ( x, y, z ) not all zero, with absolute values at most ( sqrt[3]{p} ), such that ( p mid ax + by + cz ). 3. **Factorization:** The given expression ( a^3 + 2b^3 + 4c^3 - 6abc ) can be factorized using Titu's factorization: [ x^3 + 2y^3 + 4z^3 - 6xyz = left(x + sqrt[3]{2}y + sqrt[3]{4}zright)left[x^2 + (sqrt[3]{2}y)^2 + (sqrt[3]{4}z)^2 - xsqrt[3]{2}y - sqrt[3]{2}ysqrt[3]{4}z - sqrt[3]{4}zxright] ] 4. **Surjectivity of ( x rightarrow x^3 ) Modulo ( p ):** For primes ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ), the map ( x rightarrow x^3 ) is surjective modulo ( p ). This means every element in ( mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z} ) can be written as ( x^3 ) for some ( x ). 5. **Existence of Cube Roots:** Let ( epsilon ) be the cube root of 2 modulo ( p ), i.e., ( epsilon^3 equiv 2 pmod{p} ). Such an ( epsilon ) exists due to the surjectivity mentioned above. 6. **Application of Thue's Theorem:** By Thue's theorem, there exist integers ( u, v, w ) with absolute values at most ( sqrt[3]{p} ) such that ( p mid u + epsilon v + epsilon^2 w ). This implies: [ p mid u^3 + 2v^3 + 4w^3 - 6uvw ] 7. **Bounding the Expression:** Since ( |u|, |v|, |w| leq sqrt[3]{p} ), we have: [ |u^3 + 2v^3 + 4w^3 - 6uvw| < 13p ] We can ensure the expression is nonnegative by replacing ( (u, v, w) ) with ( (-u, -v, -w) ) if necessary. 8. **Defining ( theta_p ):** For each prime ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ), define integers ( u_p, v_p, w_p, theta_p ) such that: [ u_p^3 + 2v_p^3 + 4w_p^3 - 6u_pv_pw_p = ptheta_p ] where ( theta_p ) is a nonnegative integer strictly less than 13. 9. **Common ( theta ):** As ( p ) varies over all primes of the form ( 3k + 2 ), there must be a common ( theta ) for infinitely many such primes. Denote this common value by ( theta ). 10. **Conclusion:** If ( theta ) is non-zero, then ( n = theta ) is our desired positive integer. If ( theta = 0 ), it implies the equation ( x + sqrt[3]{2}y + sqrt[3]{4}z = 0 ) has infinitely many solutions, which is impossible. Therefore, ( theta ) is indeed positive.

It is known that any two neighboring numbers differ either by 1, or by 2, or by a factor of two. Prove that at least one of these numbers is divisible by 3.","completion":"1. Suppose none of the 99 numbers is divisible by 3. Then each number must give a remainder of either 1 or 2 when divided by 3. Let each number be in the form: [ x equiv 1 pmod{3} quad text{or} quad x equiv 2 pmod{3} ] 2. We consider the relationship between any two adjacent numbers. According to the problem, any two adjacent numbers differ by either 1, 2, or are twice the other. 3. Next, we analyze how numbers with the same remainder will interact under these conditions: - Numbers that give the same non-zero remainder modulo 3 cannot differ by 1 or 2: [ (3k + 1) - (3k + 1) = 0 quad (text{not }1 text{ or }2) ] [ (3k + 2) - (3k + 2) = 0 quad (text{not } 1 text{ or } 2) ] - Numbers that give the same remainder cannot be twice the other: [ frac{3k + 1}{3k + 1} = 1 quad (text{not } 2) ] [ frac{3k + 2}{3k + 2} = 1 quad (text{not } 2) ] 4. This means adjacent numbers must have different remainders modulo 3. Thus, one number must have a remainder of 1 and the next must have a remainder of 2, and vice versa. 5. If we follow this pattern continuously around a circle, alternating between numbers of the form (3k + 1) and (3k + 2), we need to have an even number of total numbers to maintain the pattern. This is because for each pair (1 and 2), the count must be even to alternate consistently. 6. Given that we have 99 numbers (which is odd), it is impossible to arrange them in such a manner without breaking the pattern.

Let (S) be that intersection point, implying (S neq B). 3. **Intersection of Lines**: Extend line (SB') to intersect line (CA) at point (T). 4. **The Trident Lemma**: According to the Trident Lemma (Problem 53119), the points (S, A, C, I) lie such that (SA = SC = SI). This lemma ensures that these points are symmetrical to each other by the properties of the circle they lie on. 5. **Symmetry and Angles**: Due to symmetry, we have (angle IBB' = angle I B'B = phi). This results from (OB = OB') since (B') is a symmetrical counterpart of (B). 6. **Inscribed Quadrilateral**: The quadrilateral (A B' SB) is inscribed in the circle because it maintains equal angles: [ angle SAB' = angle SBB' = varphi ] 7. **Angles at (T)**: Notice the angle relationships: [ angle ATS = angle CAS = angle CBS - angle ABB' = angle ABS - angle ABB' = varphi ] Here, we use the properties of inscribed angles and the triangular symmetry to equate it to (varphi). 8. **Triangle Similarity**: Through these angle equalities, the triangles (SAB') and (STA) are similar by having two pairs of equal angles. Consequently, [ S B' parallel ST implies SA^2 = SI^2 ] 9. **Tangency**: It follows that the line (SI) must be a tangent to the circumscribed circle (omega) of the triangle (TIB'), using tangency conditions. 10. **Angle Calculation**: Therefore, we determine that [ angle ITB' = angle B'IS = 2varphi ] and [ angle ITA = angle ITB' - varphi = varphi ] 11. **Final Consideration of Line (AC)**: Let (K) be the second intersection of (omega) with the line (AC): [ angle K B' I = angle KTI = varphi = angle IBB' ] Ensuring, [ angle K I B' = angle K T B' = varphi = angle I B' B ] 12. **Tangents Meeting at (K)**: Thus, (KI) and (KB') are tangents to the circumscribed circle of triangle (B B' I) and the point (K) lies on the line (AC).

By Heron's formula, the area ( A ) of the triangle is given by: [ A = sqrt{p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c)} ] where ( p ) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. For our triangle: [ p = frac{(s-1) + s + (s+1)}{2} = frac{3s}{2} ] Thus, the area ( A ) becomes: [ A = sqrt{frac{3s}{2} left( frac{3s}{2} - (s-1) right) left( frac{3s}{2} - s right) left( frac{3s}{2} - (s+1) right)} ] Simplifying the terms inside the square root: [ A = sqrt{frac{3s}{2} cdot frac{s+2}{2} cdot frac{s}{2} cdot frac{s-2}{2}} = frac{s}{4} sqrt{3s^2 - 12} ] 2. **Condition for the area to be an integer:** For ( frac{s}{4} sqrt{3s^2 - 12} ) to be an integer, ( sqrt{3s^2 - 12} ) must be an integer.

If they cross each other in an unknown amount of time, and the speed of each train (in km/hr) is 12, how long does it take for them to cross each other in seconds?","completion":"To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we first need to determine the relative speed at which they are moving towards each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds together to get the relative speed. The speed of each train is 12 km/hr. So, the relative speed is: 12 km/hr + 12 km/hr = 24 km/hr To calculate the time, we need to know the total distance covered when the trains cross each other. Since both trains are 120 meters long, the total distance is: 120 meters + 120 meters = 240 meters Now, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s to match the units of distance (meters). We know that 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds. So, 24 km/hr = (24 * 1000 meters) / (3600 seconds) 24 km/hr = 24000 meters / 3600 seconds 24 km/hr = 6.67 meters/second (rounded to two decimal places) Now we can calculate the time it takes for the trains to cross each other using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 240 meters / 6.67 meters/second Time ≈ 35.98 seconds Therefore, it takes approximately boxed{36} seconds for the two trains to cross each other."},{"prompt":"Given that 2+i and 2i are the two roots of the quadratic equation with real coefficients x^2+px+q=0 in the complex domain, find the values of p and q.","completion":"Since 2+i and 2-i are the roots of the quadratic equation with real coefficients x^2+px+q=0 in the complex domain, By Vieta's formulas (the relationship between the roots and coefficients of a quadratic equation), we easily get: (2+i) + (2-i) = -p (2+i) cdot (2-i) = q Solving these, we find p = -4 and q = 5.

This type of problem involves some geometric constructions and a bit of ingenuity. 1. **Objective**: To divide an angle of (19^circ) into 19 equal angles, we essentially need to construct an angle of (1^circ). 2. **Repetition of Angles**: Observe that if an angle (19^circ) is repeated 19 times, the resulting angle is: [ 19^circ times 19 = 361^circ ] The angle completes a full circle of (360^circ) plus an extra (1^circ). Here, the observation is critical as it reduces the problem to constructing (1^circ). 3. **Targeting (1^circ) Construction**: Although we can easily identify and measure (1^circ) geometrically, our tools are a compass and a straightedge. We will use geometric patterns and iterative construction to approach (1^circ) by leveraging properties of inscribed angles and circles: 4. **Construction Strategy**: - **Step 1**: Construct a circle with a known radius using the compass. Label the center of the circle as (O). - **Step 2**: Select a point (A) on the circumference of the circle and draw the radius (OA). - **Step 3**: Using the compass, step off arc lengths around the circle such that ( angle AOB = 1^circ ) iteratively by constructing sub-multiples if needed and refining. 5. **Dividing Circle into 360 equal parts**: - **Step 4**: Construct a regular hexagon inside the circle (as a step towards finer divisions). Hexagon divides the circle into 6 equal (60^circ) angles, then divide these further. - **Step 5**: Continue using the bisection method, halving each known angle successively (e.g., 60° to 30°, 30° to 15°, and so forth) until approaching (1^circ) precision. 6. **Detail Construction**: - **Step 6**: Halve (3^circ) segments to pinpoint (1.5^circ), then theoretically from these by iterations and fine alignment to construct (1^circ) constructions accurately on compass grid. 7. **Result Achievement**: - **Step 7**: Combine these (1^circ) sections to confirm (19^circ); ensuring the angle sum using the compass positions reconciles to the original problem. # Conclusion: Through iterative halving and combination of basic geometric principles, we can construct an angle of (1^circ), and hence, divide the given angle of (19^circ) into 19 equal parts as required.

To begin, we examine the equation to determine if it can be factored into a perfect square form. Adding and subtracting y^2 gives us (x^2+2xy+y^2) + (8-1)y^2 + 14y + m = 0, which simplifies to: (x+y)^2 + 7y^2 + 14y + m = 0. Now, if we can make 7y^2 + 14y a perfect square as well, we can then possibly identify the two lines. Adding and subtracting 7 to complete the square gives us 7(y^2 + 2y + 1), which can be rewritten as 7(y+1)^2. So our equation becomes: (x+y)^2 + 7(y+1)^2 + m = 0. Note that for this to represent two lines, the sum of two squares must equal zero, which happens only if both squares individually equal zero. That is, we require (x+y)^2 = 0 and 7(y+1)^2 = 0 simultaneously. So, we have two lines given by x+y=0 and y+1=0. Therefore, the constant m must be set in such a way that m=7, ensuring (x+y)^2 + 7(y+1)^2 equals 7 when both are equal to zero. This gives us the final equation as: (x+y)^2 + 7(y+1)^2 + 7 = 0.

On the tenth day, he takes out a fish for every evennumbered fish present, and on the twelfth day, he adds fish according to the mathematical equation: 3x + 5, where x is the current number of fish in the aquarium. How many fish in total does he have?","completion":"Let's calculate the number of fish in the aquarium step by step: Day 1: Jason starts with 10 fish. Day 2: The number of fish triples, so he has 10 * 3 = 30 fish. Day 3: The number triples again, so he has 30 * 3 = 90 fish. Day 4: The number triples once more, so he has 90 * 3 = 270 fish. Then he takes out two-fifths of the fish, so he removes 2/5 * 270 = 108 fish. The remaining number of fish is 270 - 108 = 162 fish. Day 5: The number of fish triples again, so he has 162 * 3 = 486 fish. Day 6: The number triples once more, so he has 486 * 3 = 1458 fish. Then he removes three-sevenths of the fish, so he removes 3/7 * 1458 = 624 fish. The remaining number of fish is 1458 - 624 = 834 fish. Day 7: The number of fish triples again, so he has 834 * 3 = 2502 fish. Day 8: The number triples once more, so he has 2502 * 3 = 7506 fish. Then he adds 25 more fish, so he has 7506 + 25 = 7531 fish. Day 9: The number of fish triples again, so he has 7531 * 3 = 22593 fish. Day 10: The number triples once more, so he has 22593 * 3 = 67779 fish. Then he takes out a fish for every even-numbered fish present. To find out how many even-numbered fish there are, we divide the total number by 2, so he removes 67779 / 2 = 33889.5 fish. Since we can't have half a fish, we'll round down to 33889 fish. The remaining number of fish is 67779 - 33889 = 33890 fish. Day 11: The number of fish triples again, so he has 33890 * 3 = 101670 fish. Day 12: The number triples once more, so he has 101670 * 3 = 305010 fish. Then he adds fish according to the equation 3x + 5, where x is the current number of fish. So he adds 3 * 305010 + 5 = 915030 + 5 = 915035 fish. The total number of fish Jason has on the twelfth day is the sum of the fish before adding and the fish added according to the equation: 305010 (current number of fish) + 915035 (fish added) = 1220045 fish.

A two-digit palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards, which means it has the form of AB where A is the digit in the tens place and B is the digit in the ones place.

This graph has ( n^2 ) vertices, and we connect two vertices if and only if the corresponding numbers in the rows are the same. 3. **Lemma:** We need to prove the following lemma: *Lemma:* Consider all edge transitive subgraphs on an ( n )-partite graph ( G ). Prove that all these subgraphs are induced subgraphs of ( n ) independent ( K_n )'s with edge set same as that of ( G ). 4. **Proof of Lemma:** We use induction on the number of edges of a subgraph ( H ) and suppose for argument's sake that ( H ) is not 1-regular. - If there are no edges, the statement is obvious. - Take a vertex ( v ) of ( H ) such that ( text{deg}(v) geq 2 ).

This intersection cuts the triangle ACD into two regions: one of which is a quadrilateral and the other a triangle. 4. **Description of Regions:** - Any line through B (not through D) intersects triangle ACD thus creating new regions. - Specifically, when the line intersects at some point on AC and at some point not-on BD, it divides the region ACD into a smaller triangle and a quadrilateral. 5. **Conclusion:** Through this construction and analysis, we have identified that with n=4 lines, there will always be at least one quadrilateral formed among the regions divided by the lines.

Since the segments are equal, the following holds: [ AL = BN, quad AD = BC ] 4. **Median and Altitude:** - In the isosceles triangles (ALD) and (BNC), the segment (LN) serves as both a median and an altitude. - Hence, (LN) is perpendicular to (AD) and (BC). 5. **Right Triangles:** - Because (LN) is perpendicular to the bases (AD) and (BC), the triangles (ALN) and (BNL) are right triangles. - As such, they can be shown to be congruent by hypotenuse-leg (HL) congruence: [ AN = NL, quad BL = NL implies AN = BL ] - Consequently, quadrilateral (ANLB) forms a rectangle. 6. **Rectangular Conclusion:** - Similarly, consider the midpoint connections for (DM) and (CL).

Assume that in some (1 times 5) shape on the grid (let's call it (mathcal{F1})), a certain color is absent. Without loss of generality, assume this missing color is blue. 2. **Analysis of Cross Shapes**: Given our assumption that blue is missing in (mathcal{F1}), we consider two cross shapes ((mathcal{F2})) centered around the columns of (mathcal{F1}) as illustrated below:: [ begin{array}{ccccc} a & b & c & d & e & f & g & h & i end{array} ] Let's denote the cells of (mathcal{F1}) as ({a, b, c, d, e}).

This implies, given our arrangement and the condition on differing colors within each cross, every pair of cells taken from �(mathcal{F1}) and the cross must introduce a blue cell at least once. 4. **Contradiction**: Because our original assumption leads us to the need of introducing the blue cell to maintain the differing color condition, we reach the contradiction that blue cannot be absent from the (1 times 5 ) figure: * If blue is included in required cross arrangements stemming from (mathcal{F1}), each derived subfigure must have the differing color requirement remaining intact. 5. **Conclusion**: By covering all configurations and analyzing the constraint on color within the larger and smaller shapes equivalently, we resolve that the initial (1 times 5) pattern must indeed contain all 5 colors, and hence, any other derived (1 times 5) must also satisfy this same criterion. Thus, we have shown that any (1 times 5) figure must contain all 5 colors distinctively. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Compute Z_1 = i^4 + i^5 + i^6 + ldots + i^{12} and Z_2 = i^4 cdot i^5 cdot i^6 cdot ldots cdot i^{12}, and find the relationship between Z_1 and Z_2.","completion":"We know that i^2 = -1 and hence, i^4 = (i^2)^2 = 1.

Here is the full detail of how we arrive at the answer. 1. **Understanding the Problem**: - There are 500 cyclists in a race. - The race consists of 15 stages. - Cyclists' positions are determined by their total time across all stages. - No cyclists have identical times, either on individual stages or in total. - Vasya finishes 7th in every stage. 2. **Key Observation**: - If a cyclist ( A ) has a better (lower-numbered) rank than cyclist ( B ), it means ( A ) must have finished ahead of ( B ) in at least one stage. 3. **Implication for Vasya**: - Vasya, finishing 7th in all 15 stages, is therefore overtaken by 6 cyclists in each stage. - Hence, across all 15 stages, a total of ( 6 times 15 = 90 ) different cyclists must have finished ahead of Vasya. 4. **Maximum Possible Rank for Vasya**: - Since Vasya is overtaken by 90 different cyclists, the highest rank Vasya can attain is when these 90 cyclists all finish ahead of him. This implies that there could be at most 90 cyclists with a better (lower-numbered) total time than Vasya. - Therefore, Vasya can potentially finish right after these 90 cyclists, giving him the rank: [ 1 + 90 = 91 ] Hence, Vasya’s worst possible rank (highest number) is 91, meaning there cannot be more than 90 cyclists above him; otherwise, there would be not enough distinct cyclists overtaking Vasya consistently. 5. **Example of Achieving Position 91**: - To verify that 91st place is possible for Vasya, consider the following: - If in each stage, the 6 cyclists finishing ahead of Vasya are different, we then have 90 distinct cyclists who consistently finish ahead of him. - Assume these 90 cyclists have all different total times just ahead of Vasya. - The remaining 409 cyclists finish behind Vasya in every stage and thus have worse total times than him. - If Vasya's total time is consistently ( T_7 ) per stage, and assume ( T_7 ) is in the middle range as described.

The final price of the good after applying all the discounts is Rs. 12,000.

Let's denote the original price as P. The final price is reached after applying five successive discounts. We can represent each discount as a multiplication by a factor that corresponds to the remaining percentage of the price after the discount. For example, a 25% discount means the price is reduced to 75% of its previous amount, so we multiply by 0.75 (since 75% = 75/100 = 0.75). Let's apply this logic to all the discounts in reverse order: 1. After the last discount of 2%, the price is Rs. 12,000. To find the price before this discount, we divide by (1 - 0.02) or 0.98: Price before last discount = Rs. 12,000 / 0.98 2.

Set ( d_1 = b ) and ( d_2 = a ), noting that: [ a + b equiv r + b notequiv r pmod{p} ] Each residue occurs among the remaining ( c_i ) at most: [ frac{n+1}{2} - 1 = frac{n-1}{2} = frac{(n-2)+1}{2} ] times, so we can again use the inductive hypothesis to complete the list. 3. **Main Problem:** Given ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_N ) such that any specific value occurs at most ( frac{51}{100}N ) times and ( a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_N ) is not divisible by ( p ), we need to show there exists a permutation ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_N ) such that for all ( k = 1, 2, ldots, N ), the sum ( b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_k ) is not divisible by ( p ). 4. If each residue occurs at most ( frac{N+1}{2} ) times, we can directly apply the Key Lemma. Otherwise, let ( a ) be the residue that occurs ( M > frac{N+1}{2} ) times among the ( a_i ). We set ( b_i = a ) for ( 1 leq i leq k ), where ( k leq p-1 ) is an integer we will determine. As ( p ) is prime, this will ensure that none of the first ( k ) partial sums is divisible by ( p ). We will then complete the rest of the list using the Key Lemma, which requires us to show each residue occurs at most ( frac{N-k+1}{2} ) times among the remaining ( a_i ). 5. **Residue ( a ):** ( a ) occurs among the remaining ( a_i ) exactly ( M - k ) times, so we require: [ M - k leq frac{N - k + 1}{2} Leftrightarrow k geq 2M - N - 1 quad quad (blacktriangle) ] Observe that: [ 2M - N - 1 leq frac{102N}{100} - N - 1 = frac{N}{50} - 1 < p - 1 ] So this will not force us to violate the ( k leq p-1 ) condition. 6. **Other residues:** The other residues occur at most ( N - M ) times, so we want: [ N - M leq frac{N - k + 1}{2} Leftrightarrow k leq 2M + 1 - N quad quad (blacksquare) ] And observe ( 2M + 1 - N > 2 cdot frac{N+1}{2} + 1 - N geq 1 ). 7. So, if we choose ( k = 2M - N ), we satisfy the two conditions ( (blacktriangle) ) and ( (blacksquare) ) and ( 1 leq k leq p-1 ), so the conditions of the Key Lemma are satisfied.

The king starts from the bottom-left corner and moves to the top-right corner along the diagonal. The players take turns: the king moves first, followed by one of the rooks. We need to prove that the king will eventually be in check. 2. **Inductive Reasoning and Movement Analysis**: Suppose the king never finds himself in check. We know that each rook must change both its initial vertical (file) and horizontal (rank) position during the game. This is because, for the king never to be in check, each rook must actively avoid the king's path, necessitating a minimum of two moves per rook (one to change its file and one to change its rank). Thus, each rook makes at least two distinct moves. 3. **Total Move Calculation**: Hence, the total number of moves made by all rooks combined is at least: [ text{Total moves by rooks} = 10 times 2 = 20 ] 4. **Move Comparison**: The king moves along the diagonal from (1,1) to (20,20). As the king traverses the diagonal, it takes exactly: [ text{Total moves by king} = 19 ] steps, since it moves from one square to the next along a straight line that results in 19 steps (from the first square to the 20th square). 5. **Contradiction**: Therefore, we have a scenario where the total number of moves made by the rooks (20) must match the moves made by the king (19). This presents a contradiction because: [ 20 neq 19 ] 6. **Logical Conclusion**: Since our initial assumption—that the king never finds himself in check—leads to a logical contradiction in the total move count, our assumption must be false. # Conclusion: Thus, there will be a moment when the king is in check, regardless of the initial positions of the rooks or their movement strategies.

The mass of the iron block is given as 0.4kg, but this information is supplementary as we focus on volume displacement to find the volume of the iron block. 2. The radius of the cylindrical container is 5cm, and its height is 10cm. However, the height of the water before and after submerging the iron block is crucial for our calculation. 3. Initially, the water level is 6cm. This means the volume of water before submerging the iron block is pi times 5^2 times 6. 4. After submerging the iron block, the water level rises to 8cm. Therefore, the volume of water plus the iron block is pi times 5^2 times 8. 5. Let the volume of the iron block be x cm^3. The increase in water level (and thus volume) is due to the volume of the iron block. So, we set up the equation based on the principle of volume displacement: [x + pi times 5^2 times 6 = pi times 5^2 times 8] 6.

Let's establish the initial setup. Denote the initial position of the knight as (0,0) and let the target square be (i,j). Here, i represents the column index, and j represents the row index on an infinite chessboard. The knight can move in two ways: - It can move horizontally n squares and vertically 1 square, which produces the move (n,1). - It can move horizontally 1 square and vertically n squares, which produces the move (1, n). 2. Suppose n is an odd integer. We consider the knight's movement when n is odd. - After each move, the knight's position changes by either pm n pm 1 horizontally and vertically. - Therefore, the sum of the coordinates (i, j) after any number of moves will be odd, i.e., (i + j) is always odd. This can be proven as follows: - Starting from (0,0): [ (i, j) longrightarrow (i pm n, j pm 1) quad text{or} quad (i pm 1, j pm n). ] - Since n is odd: [ n + 1 quad text{or} quad n - 1 quad text{are even numbers}. ] - Given this, the parity of each coordinate pair sum (i + j) is maintained. 3. As a result, if the initial sum i + j is even, the knight can't move to any square (a, b) where the sum a + b is odd, when n is odd. Thus, the knight cannot reach any square where the sum of its coordinates is odd starting from an even sum position and vice versa. 4. Now, consider when n is even: - The knight can reach any neighboring square of a square from its starting position utilizing a sequence of moves. - A series of moves demonstrating the knight returning to a square (1,0) from the starting square (0,0) includes: [ begin{aligned} (0,0) & rightarrow (1,n) rightarrow (n+1,n-1) rightarrow (1,n-2) rightarrow ldots rightarrow (n+1,1) rightarrow (1,0). end{aligned} ] - Here, the knight's various possible intermediate positions are illustrated with an example move series where it touches the expected spots as required. 5. Consequently, if a knight can move to a neighboring square, it implies it can also cover any square on the board if allowed to finite steps when n is even. 6. Therefore, when analyzing moves, - For any odd integer n, the knight cannot reach squares such that i + j is odd. - For any even integer n, the knight is unrestricted and can reach any square on the infinite chessboard. **Conclusion**: The knight can reach any specified square on the chessboard if and only if n is an even number. boxed{n text{ is even}}"},{"prompt":"Given the hyperbola C: frac{x^2}{a^2} y^2 = 1 (a > 0) and the line l: x + y = 1, which intersect at two distinct points A and B. 1.

Substitute n = 2k^2 into the second condition: 3n = 3(2k^2) = 6k^2 = y^5. Here, we need 6k^2 to be a perfect fifth power. Since 6 = 2 cdot 3, both 2 and 3 must be to the fifth power in y^5. 3.

We'll construct such a set step-by-step. 1. Construction of the Set Consider the set ( S ) which consists of 4004 positive integers. Let’s split these 4004 integers into two groups of 2002 integers each: - Select 2002 positive integers that are all congruent to ( 0 mod 2003 ). - Select the other 2002 positive integers that are all congruent to ( 1 mod 2003 ). 2. Properties of the Set Observe the following: - Any integer ( a equiv 0 mod 2003 ) has the form ( a = 2003k ) for some positive integer ( k ). - Any integer ( b equiv 1 mod 2003 ) has the form ( b = 2003m + 1 ) for some positive integer ( m ). 3. Analysis of Subsets We need to check the sum of any subset of 2003 elements from ( S ). Let's analyze the composition of such a subset in terms of elements that are ( 0 mod 2003 ) and ( 1 mod 2003 ). - In any subset of 2003 elements, let ( x ) be the number of elements that are congruent to ( 1 mod 2003 ) and ( y ) be the number of elements that are congruent to ( 0 mod 2003 ): [ x + y = 2003 ] - Since there are only 2002 integers in each of the ( 0 ) mod 2003 and ( 1 ) mod 2003 groups, it follows that: [ 1 leq x leq 2002 quad text{(since there must be at least one ( 1 mod 2003 ) and at most 2002)} ] and [ 1 leq y leq 2002 quad text{(since there must be at least one ( 0 mod 2003 ) and at most 2002)} ] 4.

Since we are asked to group the numbers (1, 2, 3, ldots, 100) such that the sum of the numbers in each group is a prime number, note that the only even prime number is (2). 2. Consider groups that contain all even numbers. A sum of even numbers will always be even. The only way to make an even sum a prime number is if the sum is (2), meaning the group can consist only of the number (2). 3. Excluding the number (2), there are (99) numbers left to be grouped. Since each remaining group must include at least one odd number to avoid an even sum, we analyze the remaining (99) numbers. 4. We can create groups such that their sums are prime numbers by pairing numbers cleverly. For example, consider the pairs: - Pair numbers in the form of ((k, 101-k)) where (k) ranges from (1) to (50). All these pairs sum to (101), which is a prime number. Thus, these pairs are: [ (1, 100), (2, 99), (3, 98), ldots, (50, 51) ] - Note that the sum (101) is achieved by taking each number (k) and its complement (101-k). 5. There is one exception in the pairs (k=2) and (k=4): - For (k=2), we only take the number (2) itself. - For (k=4), pairing (4) with (99) results in a sum (103) which is a prime number. However, since this pairing method is standard, moving on, all pairs from (1) to (50) meet the pairing sum condition. 6. The number (97) remains unpaired since it is a prime number in itself and hence can be a single number group. 7. Let's count the total number of groups formed: - We create (50) pairs such that each sums up to (101). - We have the number (2) as a standalone group. - We have the number (97) as a standalone group. 8.

Speed in m/s = Speed in km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 72 * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 72 * (1000 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 72 * (5 / 18) Speed in m/s = 20 m/s Now, we know the train takes 10 seconds to pass a pole. Since the length of the train is the distance it covers in 10 seconds at a speed of 20 m/s, we can calculate the length of the train (L_train) as follows: L_train = Speed * Time L_train = 20 m/s * 10 s L_train = 200 m The train takes 35 seconds to cross a stationary train. This means the moving train covers the length of itself plus the length of the stationary train in 35 seconds. Let's denote the length of the stationary train as L_stationary.

Initially, the grasshoppers occupy three vertices of a square. Can they, by playing leapfrog, reach the fourth vertex of the square?","completion":"1. Introduce a coordinate system on the plane such that the three vertices of the square, where the grasshoppers are initially located, have the coordinates ((0, 0)), ((0, 1)), and ((1, 0)). These points represent three vertices of a unit square. 2. Let's analyze the jumping mechanism. If a grasshopper jumps from point (A) over point (B) to reach point (C), this means that (C) is the symmetric point of (A) relative to (B). Mathematically, this can be expressed as: [ C = 2B - A ] where (A) and (B) are the coordinates of the points before the jump, and (C) is the resulting point after the jump. 3. We need to examine how each coordinate of the grasshoppers changes with these jumps. Consider the horizontal ((x)) and vertical ((y)) coordinates separately: - When jumping along the (x)-axis (changing (x)-coordinate), the (y)-coordinate remains unchanged. - When jumping along the (y)-axis (changing (y)-coordinate), the (x)-coordinate remains unchanged. - A jump essentially changes the relevant coordinate of the jumping grasshopper to twice the coordinate of the reference grasshopper minus the coordinate of the jumping grasshopper. 4. In our specific case, the initial coordinates of the grasshoppers are ((0, 0)), ((0, 1)), and ((1, 0)). Observe that at least one of the coordinates of each point is even: - For ((0, 0)), both coordinates are even. - For ((0, 1)), the (x)-coordinate is even. - For ((1, 0)), the (y)-coordinate is even. 5. Now consider the initial evenness distribution. If a grasshopper jumps, one of its coordinates will be updated as described in step 2. Regardless of the jumping actions, the relevant coordinate of the resulting point will either: - Remain even if jumping across an axis (since they don't change); or - Change, but still, result in an even number since the even coordinate (or a calculation involving an even number) preserves the property every jump: [ text{Even} - (text{Even} - text{Even}) = text{Even} ] 6. Since the coordinates corresponding to even numbers are invariant under the defined jumping scheme, each grasshopper maintains a coordinate (either (x) or (y)) that remains even throughout the sequence of jumps. 7.

Now consider three consecutive numbers (n, n+1, n+2). Only one of these numbers can be divisible by 3, as 3 consecutive natural numbers will only have one multiple of 3 among them. - Hence, if one of ([6n, 6(n+1), 6(n+2)]) is divisible by 3 again in its factorization, then the other two should avoid introducing a new prime. 6.

Let's check: - Consider ( n = 54 ): - Sum of digits: ( 5 + 4 = 9 ). - ( 9 ) is divisible by ( 9 ). - Check divisibility of ( 54 ) by ( 9 ): ( 54 div 9 = 6 ) (which means ( 54 ) is divisible by ( 9 )).

However, being a measure is different from being the greatest common measure. 3. **Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: For two lengths to have a common measure greater than 1 cm, we need to find their greatest common divisor (GCD). Let's use the Euclidean algorithm: - Consider the segments 19 cm and 190 cm. - The lengths are given as integers, so we calculate the GCD of 19 and 190: [ gcd(19, 190) ] First, divide 190 by 19: [ 190 div 19 = 10 quad text{remainder} quad 0 ] 4. **Inspect result**: Because the remainder is 0, the process ends, and the GCD is the divisor used: [ gcd(19, 190) = 19 ] This tells us that the greatest common measure for the two segments in terms of centimeters is 19 cm. 5. **Conclusion**: Since the 19 cm segment fits exactly into both the 19 cm segment (exactly once) and the 190 cm segment (exactly ten times), 19 cm is indeed the greatest common measure, not 1 cm.

So, if we need to cover 35 squares in each layer, each layer requires frac{35}{3} trominos.

For each square colored A, to be covered exactly k times, each A square must be covered by one tromino in each layer. 5. **Demand Check:** - We observe that to cover all 12 A squares fully k times, we would need 12 times k trominos. - Since each L-tromino must be used 3 times more than the number of A squares times the layers k, we get: [ 12 times 3k = 36k ] trominos needed just for the A squares. 6. **Comparing Demand and Supply:** - But initially, we assumed we'd have only 35k trominos because we have 35 squares and k layers: [ 35k text{ trominos} ] - Clearly, 36k trominos required just for the A squares alone means we do not have enough trominos. # Conclusion: Hence, it is not possible to cover a 5 times 7 grid with L-shaped trominos in any number of layers, ensuring each square is covered the same number of times. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"When x is multiplied by 3, the result is 16 more than the result of subtracting x from 36.

Now, we want to find the remainder when N is divided by 18. To do this, we can substitute N into the division by 18: (N) mod 18 = (242k + 100) mod 18 We can distribute the mod operation over the addition: = (242k mod 18) + (100 mod 18) Now, we need to find the remainders of 242k and 100 when divided by 18.

Hence, a_n must introduce new prime factors that were not factors of a_{n-1}. 4. **Sequence's Growth**: Note that a_{n-1} - 1 > 1 for all n ge 0, which implies: [ a_n > a_{n-1} ] This guarantees that the sequence {a_n} is strictly increasing. 5. **Existence of Infinite Distinct Primes**: If p mid a_{n-1}-1, then: [ p mid a_n, quad p nmid a_{n-1} ] The construction of a_n ensures that new prime factors can always be introduced.

Since b_n = a_n - 2 and the sequences differ by a constant 2, the absence of a common factor other than 2 between any b_n and a_n confirms that primes which cannot be found in {b_n} structure always align in {a_n} set. **Conclusion**: [ boxed{text{There are infinitely many primes that do not divide any term in the sequence } {a_n}.} ]"},{"prompt":"a classroom, there was an addition problem written on the board involving two integers.

Hence, ( gcd(n, sigma(n)) neq 1 ), and such ( n ) cannot be heavy. 4. **Analyzing odd numbers:** For odd numbers ( n ), ( sigma(n) ) is also odd because the sum of odd numbers is odd.

Specifically, ( overline{ab} ) must divide both ( overline{(a-3)21b} ) and ( overline{(a-3)12b} ). - Consequently, ( overline{ab} ) must divide the difference ( overline{(a-3)21b} - overline{(a-3)12b} = 90 ). - From the list of divisors of 90 mentioned previously, the only viable options are (30, 45,) and (90) since ( overline{ab} geq 30). We need to verify that these candidates divide all their possible relatives. i. **Relative of 30**: - If ( n ) is a relative of 30, then ( n ) ends in 0 and the other digits sum to 3. - Since the last digit is 0 and the sum of the remaining digits (3) is beyond zero, ( n ) is a multiple of ( 10 times 3 = 30 ). ii. **Relative of 45**: - If ( n ) is a relative of 45, then ( n = 10A + 5 ), where (A) is a number whose digits sum to 4. - The sum of the digits of (n) as a multiple of 9 implies that ( n ) is a multiple of 9. Additionally, since ( n ) ends in 5, it is also a multiple of 5. - Therefore, ( n ) must be a multiple of ( 9 times 5 = 45 ). iii. **Relative of 90**: - If ( n ) is a relative of 90, ( n = 10A ), where (A)'s digits sum to 9. - Since ( n ) ends in 0 and is a multiple of 9, ( n ) must thus be a multiple of ( 9 times 10 = 90 ).

This means that for any integer k, the k-th term of the sequence is the same as the (k+ell)-th term. 2. **Define the sequence and properties:** The sequence is defined such that the k-th term is 0 if the sum of the digits of k is even, and 1 if the sum of the digits of k is odd. Let S(k) denote the sum of the digits of k. 3. **Consider a large integer m:** Let m be a sufficiently large positive integer. Specifically, let m be a number consisting of k nines, i.e., m = 999ldots9 (with k nines). 4. **Analyze the periodicity condition:** Since we assumed the sequence is periodic with period ell, we have: [ a_m = a_{m+ell} ] This implies that the sum of the digits of m and m+ell must have the same parity (both even or both odd). 5. **Sum of digits of m and m+ell:** The sum of the digits of m is 9k because m consists of k nines. Now consider m + ell. When ell is added to m, it will affect the digits of m.

However, if a drum also lives in the house, it will change the places of some 2 stones in the morning. Andryusha needs to determine if there is a drum in his house. 2. **Step 1**: Let Andryusha consider three disjoint 10-tuples ( A, B, ) and ( C ) from the set ( S ) of 100 stones. He should note down all the greater-smaller relations as they occur after a night has passed. This means he will have the ordered sequences of ( A, B, ) and ( C ) as given by the brownie (or potentially altered by the drum). 3. **Step 2**: Consider all 10-tuples of the following type: 2 stones from each of ( A, B, ) and ( C ) (6 stones in total) and a fixed 4-tuple from ( S setminus {A, B, C} ). This ensures that all of the (binom{10}{2} binom{10}{2} binom{10}{2}) 6-tuples occur in one such 10-tuple.

This means that at least one of the pairs ( (a_1, a_2), (b_1, b_2), (c_1, c_2) ) will not be altered by the drum. Andryusha can then compare his notes with the actual order of the stones.

We know the length of the train is 110 meters, so we can subtract this from the total distance to find the length of the bridge: Length of the bridge = Distance - Length of the train Length of the bridge ≈ 500.0000000000 meters - 110 meters Length of the bridge ≈ 390 meters Therefore, the length of the bridge is approximately boxed{390} meters."},{"prompt":"The area of a rhombus is equal to the area of a square.

Therefore, the coordinates of point A_{1} are (0,1). 2. **Find the coordinates of point B_1 and C_1:** Since quadrilateral A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}O is a square, and knowing the coordinates of A_1, we can deduce that the side length of this square is 1 (the difference in the y-coordinates of A_1 and O). Thus, the coordinates of point B_{1} are (1,1), and the coordinates of point C_{1} are (1,0), moving 1 unit to the right from O and A_1 respectively. 3. **Determine the pattern for the abscissa of point B_n:** Observing the pattern as we move from B_1 to B_2 and beyond, we notice that the abscissa of point B_{2} is 3=2^{2}-1, for B_{3} it is 7=2^{3}-1, and this pattern continues such that the abscissa of point B_{n} is 2^{n}-1 (where n is a positive integer).

First, we can substitute the value of A from the second equation into the first equation: (B + 8) + 10 = 2(B - 10) Now, let's simplify and solve for B: B + 18 = 2B - 20 Subtract B from both sides: 18 = B - 20 Add 20 to both sides: B = 38 So, B's current age is boxed{38} years old."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x) = (sqrt{1+x} + sqrt{1x})(2sqrt{1x^2} 1), find the range of real number m such that the equation f(x) = m has real number solutions with respect to x.","completion":"Let t = sqrt{1+x} + sqrt{1-x}, (sqrt{1+x} + sqrt{1-x})^2 = 2 + 2sqrt{1-x^2} = t^2, therefore 2sqrt{1-x^2} - 1 = t^2-3, therefore -1 leq t^2 - 3 leq 1, therefore sqrt{2} leq t leq 2, therefore f(x) = (sqrt{1+x} + sqrt{1-x})(2sqrt{1-x^2} - 1) = t(t^2-3), = t^3 - 3t, Taking the derivative of f(x) with respect to t, we get: f'(x) = frac{df}{dt} = 3t^2 - 3, Since the derivative is always non-negative for t in [sqrt{2}, 2], the function is monotonically increasing in this interval.

Using the formula for the divergence of a vector product: [ nabla cdot (phi mathbf{A}) = phi (nabla cdot mathbf{A}) + (mathbf{A} cdot nabla) phi, ] we apply it to (mathbf{a} = frac{varphi(r)}{r} mathbf{r}).

Now consider the case when a_2 = 3. Then, d = a_2 - a_1 = 3 - 1 = 2. In this case, the sequence is: a_i = 1 + 2(i-1) = 1, 3, 5, 7, ldots Here, a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k are all odd numbers, so n = k+1 must be an even number. Since n is even and all smaller odd numbers are relatively prime to n, n must be a power of 2. 7. When a_2 > 3, a_2 cannot be a composite number. If a_2 were composite, say a_2 = pq where p > 1 and q > 1, then: (a_2, n) = 1 implies (pq, n) = 1 implies (p, n) = 1 text{ and } (q, n) = 1 However, this implies p and q should be among 1, 2, ldots, a_2 - 1, which contradicts the minimal selection of a_2. Therefore, a_2 must be the smallest prime factor of n. 8. Since a_2 > 3, 3 cannot be relatively prime to n: 3 mid n 9. Since there exists a natural number m such that: n - 1 = 1 + md implies n = 2 + md Therefore, d must satisfy: 3 nmid d implies d equiv 1 pmod{3} 10. Since: a_2 = 1 + d implies 3 nmid a_2 implies 3 nmid (1 + d) So, d equiv 1 pmod{3}. 11. Thus: 3 mid (1 + 2d) If 1 + 2d < n, then a_3 = 1 + 2d, creating a contradiction because: gcd(a_3, n) = 3 text{ contradicts } gcd(a_3, n) = 1 If 1 + 2d geq n, then: n-1 = 1 + d This implies there are only two natural numbers less than n that are relatively prime to n: a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1 + d, giving varphi(n) = 2. 12. For n = p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} ldots p_t^{alpha_t} with p_1 < p_2 < ldots < p_t prime and alpha_i in mathbb{N} we have: varphi(n) = prod_{i=1}^{t} p_i^{alpha_i - 1}(p_i - 1) 13. With varphi(n) = 2, the only solution is n = 2 or 4, but since a_2 > 3, such n does not satisfy.

We need to analyze the behavior of this function under modular arithmetic. 2. **Initial Analysis**: Consider the initial triplet (S_0 = (a, b, c)). Applying (S) once, we get: [ S_1 = S(a, b, c) = (ab - ac, bc - ba, ca - cb). ] Notice that each component of (S_1) is a linear combination of (a), (b), and (c). 3. **Modular Arithmetic**: We are interested in the behavior of (S) modulo (abc). Specifically, we want to show that the sequence (S^n(a, b, c)) becomes periodic modulo (abc). 4. **Counting Possible Values**: Normally, there are ((abc)^3 = a^3b^3c^3) possible triplets modulo (abc). However, we can reduce this number by considering the properties of (S). 5. **Reduction of Possible Values**: - The first parameter of each (S_i) should be a multiple of (a). - The second parameter should be a multiple of (b). - The third parameter should be a multiple of (c). Therefore, in (mod abc), there are (bc) ways to select the first parameter, (ac) ways to select the second parameter, and (ab) ways to select the third parameter. This gives us at most (a^2b^2c^2) possible values. 6. **Further Reduction**: Since the sum of the parameters of (S) is zero: [ ab - ac + bc - ba + ca - cb = 0, ] if we choose the first two parameters, the third will be automatically determined. Thus, there are at most (bc cdot ac = abc cdot c) possible values. In fact, it is (abc cdot min(a, b, c)). 7. **Final Reduction**: Since the first parameter is a multiple of (a), the second is a multiple of (b), and the third is a multiple of (c), and their sum is zero, we count more. For all pairs ((a, b)), we find (c) from (a + b + c equiv 0 pmod{abc}), but this third parameter is not a multiple of (c). 8. **Lemma**: Let (gcd(a, b, c) = 1), (0 leq x < rbc), and (0 leq y < rac). The equation (ax + by equiv 0 pmod{c}) has (r^2abc) solutions. **Proof**: Let (gcd(b, c) = d). By definition, (gcd(a, d) = 1). - Let (x = 0). Then (by equiv 0 pmod{c} Rightarrow d cdot frac{b}{d} cdot y equiv 0 pmod{c} Rightarrow frac{b}{d} cdot y equiv 0 pmod{frac{c}{d}} Rightarrow y equiv 0 pmod{frac{c}{d}}). - The number of (y)'s for (x = 0) is (frac{rac}{frac{c}{d}} = rad). - Since (ax + by equiv 0 pmod{d}) and (b equiv 0 pmod{d}), (ax equiv 0 pmod{d}). Also, (gcd(a, d) = 1), so (x equiv 0 pmod{d}). - The number of (x)'s is (frac{rbc}{d}). Therefore, there are (frac{rbc}{d} cdot rad = r^2abc) integer pairs ((x, y)). (blacksquare) 9. **Back to the Original Problem**: Let (gcd(a, b, c) = r). Then (a = ralpha), (b = rbeta), (c = rtheta), and (gcd(alpha, beta, theta) = 1). [ S_0 = (a, b, c) Rightarrow S_1 = (ralpha rbeta - ralpha rtheta, rbeta rtheta - rbeta ralpha, rtheta ralpha - rtheta rbeta). ] Since (abc = r^3alphabetatheta) and the first parameter is always a multiple of (r^2alpha), there are (frac{r^3alphabetatheta}{r^2alpha} = rbetatheta) ways to select the first parameter. Using the above lemma for (gcd(alpha, beta, theta) = 1), (0 leq x < rbetatheta), and (0 leq y < ralphatheta), we get (r^2alphabetatheta) solutions. Since (r^2alphabetatheta leq r^3alphabetatheta = abc), the sequence (S) can get at most (abc) different values.

This means her new rate of making bears with an assistant is 2 * (B/H) bears per hour because a 100 percent increase doubles the rate.

We need to show that the number is divisible by 19 for any number of 3s inserted. 3. For this proof, observe any possible number formed when inserting any number of 3s between the two zeros. Let ( n ) be a non-negative integer representing the number of '3's inserted. The general form of the number is thus ( 12underbrace{3 cdots 3}_{n text{ times}})08.

We aim to show that the region covered by the shapes is less than (frac{1}{3} + 0.7d). From this, the problem statement will follow directly when (d = 0.001). 2. **Definition of Sets and Translation Vectors:** - Let (S) be the set of points in the unit square covered by the shapes. - Let (mathbf{i}) be a vector of length (d) parallel to one side of the square. - Let (mathbf{j}) be the vector obtained by rotating (mathbf{i}) by (60^circ). The sets obtained by translating (S) via (mathbf{i}) and (mathbf{j}) are denoted by (S') and (S''), respectively. Clearly, the areas of (S), (S'), and (S'') are equal. 3. **Checking Overlapping of Sets (S) and Its Translations:** - Assume that (S) overlaps with (S'). Let (P) be a common point. - Since (P) is in both (S) and (S'), there exists some point (R in S) such that (PR = d). But this implies that (P) and (R) in (S) are at distance (d), contradicting the problem's condition that any two points in the shapes cannot be exactly (d) apart.

Let (Q) be a common point. - Then, there exist points (P, R in S) such that (PQ = d) and (RQ = d), with (angle PQR = 60^circ). - This implies that (triangle PQR) is an equilateral triangle with side length (d), giving (PR = d), which leads to a contradiction as previously mentioned.

Thus, the union covers an area (T) approximately equal to (1 + d + d frac{sqrt{3}}{2} < 1 + 2.1d). 6. **Establishing the Area Bound:** - Since (S), (S'), and (S'') are disjoint and have equal areas (t), we have: [ 3t le T implies 3t le 1 + 2.1d ] - Solving for (t), [ t le frac{1 + 2.1d}{3} = frac{1}{3} + 0.7d ] # Conclusion: This shows that the region covered by the shapes cannot exceed (frac{1}{3} + 0.7d), and specifically for (d = 0.001), gives the required area bound: [ t < frac{1}{3} + 0.7 cdot 0.001 = 0.334 ] Thus, the area covered is not greater than (0.34).

This assumption is made because the problem is symmetric in (a) and (b). If we can show it for (a geq b), the argument holds for (a leq b) as well. 3. **Bound the Expression**: For (a^2 + 4b) to be a perfect square, it must fall between consecutive squares. Since (b) is a positive integer and (a geq b), we can establish the following bounds: [ a^2 < a^2 + 4b leq a^2 + 4a ] and since (4b leq 4a), [ a^2 + 4a < a^2 + 4a + 4 = (a + 2)^2 ] Combining these inequalities, we get: [ a^2 < a^2 + 4b < (a + 2)^2 ] 4. **Analyze the Interval**: The interval ((a^2, (a+2)^2)) contains no other perfect squares except possibly ((a+1)^2). 5. **Perfect Square Requirement**: If (a^2 + 4b) is a perfect square, it must be equal to ((a+1)^2). So we set up the equation: [ a^2 + 4b = (a+1)^2 ] 6. **Solve for (b)**: [ a^2 + 4b = a^2 + 2a + 1 ] Subtracting (a^2) from both sides gives: [ 4b = 2a + 1 ] Hence, [ b = frac{2a + 1}{4} ] 7. **Parity Argument**: For (b) to be an integer, (frac{2a + 1}{4}) must be an integer. However, (2a + 1) is always an odd number since (a) is an integer, and an odd number divided by 4 cannot result in an integer because the result would be a fraction. This reveals that there is a contradiction. 8. **Conclusion**: Since (4b) must be even to produce an integer (b), but (2a + 1) is odd, the equality (4b = 2a + 1) cannot hold.

We want to prove that if we sort each row in non-decreasing order and then sort each column in non-decreasing order, the rows will still be in non-decreasing order. 2. **First Step - Sorting Rows**: Let's denote the numbers in the original table as ( A_{ij} ) where ( 1 leq i leq m ) and ( 1 leq j leq n ). After sorting each row, we denote the new table as ( B ) where each row ( i ) is sorted: [ B_{i1} leq B_{i2} leq cdots leq B_{in} ] 3. **Second Step - Sorting Columns**: Next, we sort each column of ( B ) to get another table ( C ), where each column ( j ) is sorted: [ C_{1j} leq C_{2j} leq cdots leq C_{mj} ] 4. **Key property to show**: We need to demonstrate that after column sorting, the rows of ( C ) are still non-decreasing. For this, consider the ( k )-th smallest element in the sorted column ( j ) of ( B ), denoted ( b_{kj} ), and the ( k )-th smallest element in the sorted column ( l ) of ( B ), denoted ( a_{kl} ). 5. **Comparing elements before and after sorting columns**: Since columns were sorted independently by their values while keeping elements from initially sorted rows, we note that for any fixed ( l ) and ( r ), the ( k )-th smallest element must still be at least as large as the ( k )-th smallest element in the original row arrangement, i.e., [ b_{k} geq a_{k} ] Therefore, within each column ( r ), there are ( k ) elements that are not less than ( a_{k} ), and since after sorting both by rows and columns, elements conform to their positions ordered by these minimum constraints. 6. **Formulating the final step in our proof**: By sorting columns last, for row ( i ), ensure ( C_{i1} leq C_{i2} leq dots leq C_{in} ) holds as in: [ a_{k} leq b_{k} ] implies row ( i ) in ( C ) is indeed non-decreasing. **Conclusion**: Hence the rows in the resulting table ( C ) will be in non-decreasing order. [ blacksquare ] Part (b) 1. **Switching the order of sorting operations**: Now, we want to sort the columns first and then sort each row. We compare this process to part (a). 2. **Column Sorting First**: Starting with the same ( m times n ) table where each cell contains a number, we first sort each column in non-decreasing order, resulting in a table ( D ). 3. **Subsequent Row Sorting**: Next, we sort each row of ( D ) in non-decreasing order to obtain a new table ( E ). 4. **Consideration and Conclusion**: Unlike the consistent non-decreasing order maintained when sorting rows then columns, reversing the operations could lead to a different ordering and result in different placement of elements inside the table yielding potentially varied results as compared to first sorted rows and then columns. An illustrative example with adapted elements (referencing to provided drawn example) can demonstrate those specific interchanges leading to a non-consistent grid: \`\`\` Illustrative Example Here Original ( m times n ) table | Table post operations – first columns later rows. --------- | Initial | Column sorted first | Rows sorted second | \`\`\` Thus, given the steps and potential variations with reverse order: **Conclusion**: Sorting rows after columns will generally not yield the same table as sorting rows first followed by columns.

We need to prove that ( p = 3 ) or ( 6 ) divides ( p + 1 ). 2. **Divisibility by 3 Explanation**: - Observe that any integer ( p ) can be written in one of three forms: ( 3k ), ( 3k+1 ), or ( 3k+2 ) for some integer ( k ) (due to the division algorithm). - We need to check these cases to see what values ( p ) and ( p+2 ) can take when considering their primality. 3. **Case Analysis**: - **Case 1: ( p = 3k )** - If ( p = 3k ), then ( p ) is divisible by 3. - The only prime number that is a multiple of 3 is 3 itself (since any larger number would make it composite). - Therefore, ( p = 3 ) in this case. - **Case 2: ( p = 3k + 1 )** - Here, ( p+1 = 3k + 2 ), hence, ( p+2 = 3k + 3 ). - Notice that ( p+2 = 3(k+1) ) is a multiple of 3. - Since ( p+2 ) is a multiple of 3 and is strictly greater than 3 (as ( p ) is not 3 in this case), it cannot be prime unless it is exactly 3. Thus, this case does not lead to a valid solution under the condition that both ( p ) and ( p+2 ) are primes. - **Case 3: ( p = 3k + 2 )** - Now, ( p+1 = 3k + 3 ). - Therefore, ( p + 1 = 3(k+1) ), which shows that ( p+1 ) is divisible by 3. 4. **Even-Number Condition**: - Furthermore, note that ( p ) must be odd (as even prime is only 2), meaning ( p equiv 1 pmod{2} ) or ( p equiv 3 pmod{2} ). - This implies ( p+1 equiv 0 pmod{2} ), meaning ( p+1 ) is always even. 5. **Combination of Divisibility**: - ( p ) cannot be even (implied from the given ( p+2 ) scenario, which forces ( p ) to be odd). - Combining the divisors established, ( p equiv 1 pmod{2} ) and ( p equiv 1 pmod{2} ) imply ( 6 | (p+1) ). 6. **Conclusion**: - Hence, for ( p ) and ( p+2 ) to both be primes, ( p ) must be equal to 3, or ( p+1 ) must be a multiple of 6.

The profit from type A souvenirs is 60x, and since the total number of souvenirs is 40, the number of type B souvenirs is 40 - x. The profit from type B souvenirs is 80(40 - x). Therefore, the total profit y can be calculated as: y = 60x + 80(40 - x) Simplifying this expression gives: y = 60x + 3200 - 80x y = -20x + 3200 # Part 2: Maximum Profit Calculation Given the constraint that the quantity of type B souvenirs purchased does not exceed 3 times the quantity of type A souvenirs, we have the inequality: 40 - x leqslant 3x Solving this inequality for x gives: 40 leqslant 4x x geqslant 10 From part 1, we know the total profit y is a function of x: y = -20x + 3200 Since the coefficient of x in the profit function is negative (-20 < 0), the profit y decreases as x increases.

Given trapezoid BCDE with bases BE = 13 and CD = 3, and CE = 10, we are asked to find the length of segment BA and the area of pentagon ABCDE. 2. Since the trapezoid BCDE is inscribed in a circle, it is an isosceles trapezoid. Note that the angle angle CDE is obtuse, and for any point X other than E on the arc CE containing point D, CX < CE = 10 (since the side opposite to the obtuse angle in triangle CDE is the largest side). Therefore, point A cannot lie on this arc. Similarly, point A cannot lie on the arc BC not containing point D because CB = DE < CE = 10. Thus, point A lies on the arc BE not containing point C. 3.

A blood test called a lipoprotein panel can measure your cholesterol levels. Before the test, youll need to fast (not eat or drink anything but water) for 9 to 12 hours. The lipoprotein panel will give your doctor information about your: Total cholesterol. Total cholesterol is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. LDL cholesterol. LDL, or bad, cholesterol is the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockages in the arteries. HDL cholesterol. HDL, or good, cholesterol helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. Triglycerides (tri-GLIH-seh-rides). Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. Some studies suggest that a high level of triglycerides in the blood may raise the risk of coronary heart disease, especially in women. If its not possible to have a lipoprotein panel, knowing your total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol can give you a general idea about your cholesterol levels. Testing for total and HDL cholesterol does not require fasting. If your total cholesterol is 200 mg/dL or more, or if your HDL cholesterol is less than 40 mg/dL, your doctor will likely recommend that you have a lipoprotein panel. (Cholesterol is measured as milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dL) of blood.) The tables below show total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol levels and their corresponding categories.

Factors that can raise your triglyceride level include: Overweight and obesity Lack of physical activity Cigarette smoking Excessive alcohol use A very high carbohydrate diet Certain diseases and medicines Some genetic disorders"},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for High Blood Cholesterol ?","completion":"High blood cholesterol is treated with lifestyle changes and medicines. The main goal of treatment is to lower your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level enough to reduce your risk for coronary heart disease, heart attack, and other related health problems. Your risk for heart disease and heart attack goes up as your LDL cholesterol level rises and your number of heart disease risk factors increases. Some people are at high risk for heart attacks because they already have heart disease. Other people are at high risk for heart disease because they have diabetes or more than one heart disease risk factor. Talk with your doctor about lowering your cholesterol and your risk for heart disease. Also, check the list to find out whether you have risk factors that affect your LDL cholesterol goal: Cigarette smoking High blood pressure (140/90 mmHg or higher), or youre on medicine to treat high blood pressure Low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (less than 40 mg/dL) Family history of early heart disease (heart disease in father or brother before age 55; heart disease in mother or sister before age 65) Age (men 45 years or older; women 55 years or older) You can use the NHLBI 10-Year Risk Calculator to find your risk score. The score, given as a percentage, refers to your chance of having a heart attack in the next 10years. Based on your medical history, number of risk factors, and risk score, figure out your risk of getting heart disease or having a heart attack using the table below. * Some people in this category are at very high risk because theyve just had a heart attack or they have diabetes and heart disease, severe risk factors, or metabolic syndrome. If youre at very high risk, your doctor may set your LDL goal even lower, to less than 70 mg/dL. Your doctor also may set your LDL goal at this lower level if you have heart disease alone. After following the above steps, you should have an idea about your risk for heart disease and heart attack. The two main ways to lower your cholesterol (and, thus, your heart disease risk) include: Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC). TLC is a three-part program that includes a healthy diet, weight management, and physical activity. TLC is for anyone whose LDL cholesterol level is above goal. Medicines. If cholesterol-lowering medicines are needed, theyre used with the TLC program to help lower your LDL cholesterol level. Your doctor will set your LDL goal. The higher your risk for heart disease, the lower he or she will set your LDL goal. Using the following guide, you and your doctor can create a plan for treating your high blood cholesterol. Category I, high risk, your LDL goal is less than 100 mg/dL.* * Your LDL goal may be set even lower, to less than 70 mg/dL, if youre at very high risk or if you have heart disease. If you have this lower goal and your LDL is 70 mg/dL or higher, youll need to begin the TLC diet and take medicines as prescribed. Category II, moderately high risk, your LDL goal is less than 130 mg/dL Category III, moderate risk, your LDL goal is less than 130 mg/dL. Category IV, low to moderate risk, your LDL goal is less than 160 mg/dL. Lowering Cholesterol Using Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes TLC is a set of lifestyle changes that can help you lower your LDL cholesterol. The main parts of the TLC program are a healthy diet, weight management, and physical activity. The TLC Diet With the TLC diet, less than 7 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. This kind of fat is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods. No more than 25 to 35 percent of your daily calories should come from all fats, including saturated, trans, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats. You also should have less than 200 mg a day of cholesterol. The amounts of cholesterol and the types of fat in prepared foods can be found on the foods' Nutrition Facts labels. Foods high in soluble fiber also are part of the TLC diet. They help prevent the digestive tract from absorbing cholesterol. These foods include: Whole-grain cereals such as oatmeal and oat bran Fruits such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes Legumes such as kidney beans, lentils, chick peas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans A diet rich in fruits and vegetables can increase important cholesterol-lowering compounds in your diet. These compounds, called plant stanols or sterols, work like soluble fiber. A healthy diet also includes some types of fish, such as salmon, tuna (canned or fresh), and mackerel. These fish are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. These acids may help protect the heart from blood clots and inflammation and reduce the risk of heart attack. Try to have about two fish meals every week. You also should try to limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat. This means choosing low-salt and \\"no added salt\\" foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. The Nutrition Facts label on food packaging shows the amount of sodium in the item. Try to limit drinks with alcohol. Too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure and triglyceride level. (Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood.) Alcohol also adds extra calories, which will cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is a glass of wine, beer, or a small amount of hard liquor. For more information about TLC, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) \\"Your Guide to Lowering Your Cholesterol With TLC.\\" Weight Management If youre overweight or obese, losing weight can help lower LDL cholesterol. Maintaining a healthy weight is especially important if you have a condition called metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raise your risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke. The five metabolic risk factors are a large waistline (abdominal obesity), a high triglyceride level, a low HDL cholesterol level, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar. Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed if you have at least three of these metabolic risk factors. Physical Activity Routine physical activity can lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raise your HDL cholesterol level. People gain health benefits from as little as 60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. For more information about physical activity, go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' \\"2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,\\" the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article, and the NHLBI's \\"Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.\\" Cholesterol-Lowering Medicines In addition to lifestyle changes, your doctor may prescribe medicines to help lower your cholesterol. Even with medicines, you should continue the TLC program. Medicines can help control high blood cholesterol, but they dont cure it. Thus, you must continue taking your medicine to keep your cholesterol level in the recommended range. The five major types of cholesterol-lowering medicines are statins, bile acid sequestrants (seh-KWES-trants), nicotinic (nick-o-TIN-ick) acid, fibrates, and ezetimibe. Statins work well at lowering LDL cholesterol. These medicines are safe for most people. Rare side effects include muscle and liver problems. Bile acid sequestrants also help lower LDL cholesterol. These medicines usually arent prescribed as the only medicine to lower cholesterol. Sometimes theyre prescribed with statins. Nicotinic acid lowers LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raises HDL cholesterol. You should only use this type of medicine with a doctors supervision. Fibrates lower triglycerides, and they may raise HDL cholesterol. When used with statins, fibrates may increase the risk of muscle problems. Ezetimibe lowers LDL cholesterol. This medicine works by blocking the intestine from absorbing cholesterol. While youre being treated for high blood cholesterol, youll need ongoing care. Your doctor will want to make sure your cholesterol levels are controlled. He or she also will want to check for other health problems. If needed, your doctor may prescribe medicines for other health problems. Take all medicines exactly as your doctor prescribes. The combination of medicines may lower your risk for heart disease and heart attack. While trying to manage your cholesterol, take steps to manage other heart disease risk factors too. For example, if you have high blood pressure, work with your doctor to lower it. If you smoke, quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. Your doctor can help you create a reasonable weight-loss plan."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Heart Valve Disease ?","completion":"Heart valve disease occurs if one or more of your heart valves don't work well. The heart has four valves: the tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral,and aortic valves. These valves have tissue flaps that open and close with each heartbeat. The flaps make sure blood flows in the right direction through your heart's four chambers and to the rest of your body. Healthy Heart Cross-Section Birth defects, age-related changes, infections, or other conditions can cause one or more of your heart valves to not open fully or to let blood leak back into the heart chambers. This can make your heart work harder and affect its ability to pump blood. Overview How the Heart Valves Work At the start of each heartbeat, blood returning from the body and lungs fills the atria (the heart's two upper chambers). The mitral and tricuspid valves are located at the bottom of these chambers. As the blood builds up in the atria, these valves open to allow blood to flow into the ventricles (the heart's two lower chambers). After a brief delay, as the ventricles begin to contract, the mitral and tricuspid valves shut tightly. This prevents blood from flowing back into the atria. As the ventricles contract, they pump blood through the pulmonary and aortic valves. The pulmonary valve opens to allow blood to flow from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery. This artery carries blood to the lungs to get oxygen. At the same time, the aortic valve opens to allow blood to flow from the left ventricle into the aorta. The aorta carries oxygen-rich blood to the body. As the ventricles relax, the pulmonary and aortic valves shut tightly. This prevents blood from flowing back into the ventricles. For more information about how the heart pumps blood and detailed animations, go to the Health Topics How the Heart Works article. Heart Valve Problems Heart valves can have three basic kinds of problems: regurgitation, stenosis, and atresia. Regurgitation, or backflow, occurs if a valve doesn't close tightly. Blood leaks back into the chambers rather than flowing forward through the heart or into an artery. In the United States, backflow most often is due to prolapse. \\"Prolapse\\" is when the flaps of the valve flop or bulge back into an upper heart chamber during a heartbeat. Prolapse mainly affects the mitral valve. Stenosis occurs if the flaps of a valve thicken, stiffen, or fuse together. This prevents the heart valve from fully opening. As a result, not enough blood flows through the valve. Some valves can have both stenosis and backflow problems. Atresia occurs if a heart valve lacks an opening for blood to pass through. Some people are born with heart valve disease, while others acquire it later in life. Heart valve disease that develops before birth is called congenitalheart valve disease. Congenital heart valve disease can occur alone or with other congenital heart defects. Congenital heart valve disease often involves pulmonary or aortic valves that don't form properly. These valves may not have enough tissue flaps, they may be the wrong size or shape, or they may lack an opening through which blood can flow properly. Acquired heart valve disease usually involves aortic or mitral valves. Although the valves are normal at first, problems develop over time. Both congenital and acquired heart valve disease can cause stenosis or backflow. Outlook Many people have heart valve defects or disease but don't have symptoms. For some people, the condition mostly stays the same throughout their lives and doesn't cause any problems. For other people, heart valve disease slowly worsens until symptoms develop. If not treated, advanced heart valve disease can cause heart failure, stroke, blood clots, or death due to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Currently, no medicines can cure heart valve disease. However, lifestyle changes and medicines can relieve many of its symptoms and complications. These treatments also can lower your risk of developing a life-threatening condition, such as stroke or SCA. Eventually, you may need to have your faulty heart valve repaired or replaced. Some types of congenital heart valve disease are so severe that the valve is repaired or replaced during infancy, childhood, or even before birth. Other types may not cause problems until middle-age or older, if at all."},{"prompt":"What causes Heart Valve Disease ?","completion":"Heart conditions and other disorders, age-related changes, rheumatic fever, or infections can cause acquired heart valve disease. These factors change the shape or flexibility of once-normal heart valves. The cause of congenital heart valve disease isnt known. It occurs before birth as the heart is forming. Congenital heart valve disease can occur alone or with other types of congenital heartdefects. Heart Conditions and Other Disorders Certain conditions can stretch and distort the heart valves. These conditions include: Advanced high blood pressure and heart failure, thiscan enlarge the heart or the main arteries. Atherosclerosis in the aorta. Atherosclerosis is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the arteries. The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to the body. Damage and scar tissue due to a heart attack or injury to the heart. Rheumatic Fever Untreated strep throat or other infections with strep bacteria that progress to rheumatic fever can cause heart valve disease. When the body tries to fight the strep infection, one or more heart valves may be damaged or scarred in the process. The aortic and mitral valves most often are affected. Symptoms of heart valve damage often dont appear until many years after recovery from rheumatic fever. Today, most people who have strep infections are treated with antibiotics before rheumatic fever occurs. If you have strep throat, take all of the antibiotics your doctor prescribes, even if you feel better before the medicine is gone. Heart valve disease caused by rheumatic fever mainly affects older adults who had strep infections before antibiotics were available. It also affects people from developing countries, where rheumatic fever is more common. Infections Common germs that enter the bloodstream and get carried to the heart can sometimes infect the inner surface of the heart, including the heart valves. This rare but serious infection is called infective endocarditis. The germs can enter the bloodstream through needles, syringes, or other medical devices and through breaks in the skin or gums. Often, the bodys defenses fight off the germs and no infection occurs. Sometimes these defenses fail, which leads to infective endocarditis. Infective endocarditis can develop in people who already have abnormal blood flow through a heart valve as the result of congenital or acquired heart valve disease. The abnormal blood flow causes blood clots to form on the surface of the valve. The blood clots make it easier for germs to attach to and infect the valve. Infective endocarditis can worsen existing heart valve disease. Other Conditions and Factors Linked to Heart Valve Disease Many other conditions and factors are linked to heart valve disease. However, the role they play in causing heart valve disease often isnt clear. Autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, can affect the aortic and mitral valves. Carcinoid syndrome. Tumors in the digestive tract that spread to the liver or lymph nodes can affect the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Diet medicines. The use of fenfluramine and phentermine (fen-phen) sometimes has been linked to heart valve problems. These problems typically stabilize or improve after the medicine is stopped. Marfan syndrome. Congenital disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and other connective tissue disorders, can affect the heart valves. Metabolic disorders. Relatively uncommon diseases (such as Fabry disease) and other metabolic disorders (such as high blood cholesterol) can affect the heart valves. Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy to the chest area can cause heart valve disease. This therapy is used to treat cancer. Heart valve disease due to radiation therapy may not cause symptoms until years after the therapy."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Heart Valve Disease? ?","completion":"Older age is a risk factor for heart valve disease. As you age, your heart valves thicken and become stiffer. Also, people are living longer now than in the past. As a result, heart valve disease has become an increasing problem. People who have a history of infective endocarditis (IE), rheumatic fever, heart attack, or heart failureor previous heart valve diseasealso are at higher risk for heart valve disease. In addition, having risk factors for IE, such as intravenous drug use, increases the risk of heart valve disease. You're also at higher risk for heart valve disease if you have risk factors for coronary heart disease. These risk factors include high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking, insulin resistance, diabetes, overweight or obesity, lack of physical activity, and a family history of early heart disease. Some people are born with an aortic valve that has two flaps instead of three. Sometimes an aortic valve may have three flaps, but two flaps are fused together and act as one flap. This is called a bicuspid or bicommissural aortic valve. People who have this congenital condition are more likely to develop aortic heart valve disease."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Heart Valve Disease ?","completion":"Major Signs and Symptoms The main sign of heart valve disease is an unusual heartbeat sound called a heart murmur. Your doctor can hear a heart murmur with a stethoscope. However, many people have heart murmurs without having heart valve disease or any other heart problems. Others may have heart murmurs due to heart valve disease, but have no other signs or symptoms. Heart valve disease often worsens over time, so signs and symptoms may occur years after a heart murmur is first heard. Many people who have heart valve disease don't have any symptoms until they're middle-aged or older. Other common signs and symptoms of heart valve disease relate to heart failure, which heart valve disease can cause. These signs and symptoms include: Unusual fatigue (tiredness) Shortness of breath, especially when you exert yourself or when you're lying down Swelling in your ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and veins in the neck Other Signs and Symptoms Heart valve disease can cause chest pain that may happen only when you exert yourself. You also may notice a fluttering, racing, or irregular heartbeat. Some types of heart valve disease, such as aortic or mitral valve stenosis, can cause dizziness or fainting."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Heart Valve Disease ?","completion":"Your primary care doctor may detect a heart murmur or other signs of heart valve disease. However, a cardiologist usually will diagnose the condition. A cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart problems. To diagnose heart valve disease, your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms. He or she also will do a physical exam and look at the results from tests and procedures. Physical Exam Your doctor will listen to your heart with a stethoscope. He or she will want to find out whether you have a heart murmur that's likely caused by a heart valve problem. Your doctor also will listen to your lungs as you breathe to check for fluid buildup. He or she will check for swollen ankles and other signs that your body is retaining water. Tests and Procedures Echocardiography (echo) is the main test for diagnosing heart valve disease. But an EKG (electrocardiogram) or chest x ray commonly is used to reveal certain signs of the condition. If these signs are present, echo usually is done to confirm the diagnosis. Your doctor also may recommend other tests and procedures if you're diagnosed with heart valve disease. For example, you may have cardiac catheterization, (KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun), stress testing, or cardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). These tests and procedures help your doctor assess how severe your condition is so he or she can plan your treatment. EKG This simple test detects and records the heart's electrical activity. An EKG can detect an irregular heartbeat and signs of a previous heart attack. It also can show whether your heart chambers are enlarged. An EKG usually is done in a doctor's office. Chest X Ray This test can show whether certain sections of your heart are enlarged, whether you have fluid in your lungs, or whether calcium deposits are present in your heart. A chest x ray helps your doctor learn which type of valve defect you have, how severe it is, and whether you have any other heart problems. Echocardiography Echo uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart as it beats. A device called a transducer is placed on the surface of your chest. The transducer sends sound waves through your chest wall to your heart. Echoes from the sound waves are converted into pictures of your heart on a computer screen. Echo can show: The size and shape of your heart valves and chambers How well your heart is pumping blood Whether a valve is narrow or has backflow Your doctor may recommend transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo, or TEE, to get a better image of your heart. During TEE, the transducer is attached to the end of a flexible tube. The tube is guided down your throat and into your esophagus (the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach). From there, your doctor can get detailed pictures of your heart. You'll likely be given medicine to help you relax during this procedure. Cardiac Catheterization For this procedure, a long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to your heart. Your doctor uses x-ray images to guide the catheter. Through the catheter, your doctor does diagnostic tests and imaging that show whether backflow is occurring through a valve and how fully the valve opens. You'll be given medicine to help you relax, but you will be awake during the procedure. Your doctor may recommend cardiac catheterization if your signs and symptoms of heart valve disease aren't in line with your echo results. The procedure also can help your doctor assess whether your symptoms are due to specific valve problems or coronary heart disease. All of this information helps your doctor decide the best way to treat you. Stress Test During stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests and imaging are done. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate. A stress test can show whether you have signs and symptoms of heart valve disease when your heart is working hard. It can help your doctor assess the severity of your heart valve disease. Cardiac MRI Cardiac MRI uses a powerful magnet and radio waves to make detailed images of your heart. A cardiac MRI image can confirm information about valve defects or provide more detailed information. This information can help your doctor plan your treatment. An MRI also may be done before heart valve surgery to help your surgeon plan for the surgery."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Heart Valve Disease ?","completion":"Currently, no medicines can cure heart valve disease. However, lifestyle changes and medicines often can treat symptoms successfully and delay problems for many years. Eventually, though, you may need surgery to repair or replace a faulty heart valve. The goals of treating heart valve disease might include: Medicines Repairing or replacing faulty valves Lifestyle changes to treat other related heart conditions Medicines In addition to heart-healthy lifestyle changes, your doctor may prescribe medicines to: Lower high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol. Prevent arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). Thin the blood and prevent clots (if you have a man-made replacement valve). Doctors also prescribe these medicines for mitral stenosis or other valve defects that raise the risk of blood clots. Treat coronary heart disease. Medicines for coronary heart disease can reduce your hearts workload and relieve symptoms. Treatheart failure. Heart failure medicines widen blood vessels and rid the body of excess fluid. Repairing or Replacing Heart Valves Your doctor may recommend repairing or replacing your heart valve(s), even if your heart valve disease isnt causing symptoms. Repairing or replacing a valve can prevent lasting damage to your heart and sudden death. The decision to repair or replace heart valves depends on many factors, including: The severity of your valve disease Whether you need heart surgery for other conditions, such as bypass surgery to treat coronary heart disease. Bypass surgery and valve surgery can be performed at the sametime. Your age and general health When possible, heart valve repair is preferred over heart valve replacement. Valve repair preserves the strength and function of the heart muscle. People who have valve repair also have a lower risk of infective endocarditis after the surgery, and they dont need to take blood-thinning medicines for the rest of their lives. However, heart valve repair surgery is harder to do than valve replacement. Also, not all valves can be repaired. Mitral valves often can be repaired. Aortic and pulmonary valves often have to be replaced. Repairing Heart Valves Heart surgeons can repair heart valves by: Adding tissue to patch holes or tears or to increase the support at the base of the valve Removing or reshaping tissue so the valve can close tighter Separating fused valve flaps Sometimes cardiologists repair heart valves using cardiac catheterization. Although catheter procedures are less invasive than surgery, they may not work as well for some patients. Work with your doctor to decide whether repair is appropriate. If so, your doctor can advise you on the best procedure. Heart valves that cannot open fully (stenosis) can be repaired with surgery or with a less invasive catheter procedure called balloon valvuloplasty. This procedure also is called balloonvalvotomy. During the procedure, a catheter (thin tube) with a balloon at its tip is threaded through a blood vessel to the faulty valve in your heart. The balloon is inflated to help widen the opening of the valve. Your doctor then deflates the balloon and removes both it and the tube. Youre awake during the procedure, which usually requires an overnight stay in a hospital. Balloon valvuloplasty relieves many symptoms of heart valve disease, but may not cure it. The condition can worsen over time. You still may need medicines to treat symptoms or surgery to repair or replace the faulty valve. Balloon valvuloplasty has a shorter recovery time than surgery. The procedure may work as well as surgery for some patients who have mitral valve stenosis. For these people, balloon valvuloplasty often is preferred over surgical repair or replacement. Balloon valvuloplasty doesnt work as well as surgery for adults who have aortic valve stenosis. Doctors often use balloon valvuloplasty to repair valve stenosis in infants and children. Replacing Heart Valves Sometimes heart valves cant be repaired and must be replaced. This surgery involves removing the faulty valve and replacing it with a man-made or biological valve. Biological valves are made from pig, cow, or human heart tissue and may have man-made parts as well. These valves are specially treated, so you wont need medicines to stop your body from rejecting the valve. Man-made valves last longer than biological valves and usually dont have to be replaced. Biological valves usually have to be replaced after about 10 years, although newer ones may last 15years or longer. Unlike biological valves, however, man-made valves require you to take blood-thinning medicines for the rest of your life. These medicines prevent blood clots from forming on the valve. Blood clots can cause a heart attack or stroke. Man-made valves also raise your risk of infective endocarditis. You and your doctor will decide together whether you should have a man-made or biological replacement valve. If youre a woman of childbearing age or if youre athletic, you may prefer a biological valve so you dont have to take blood-thinning medicines. If youre elderly, you also may prefer a biological valve, as it will likely last for the rest of your life. Ross Procedure Doctors also can treat faulty aortic valves with the Ross procedure. During this surgery, your doctor removes your faulty aortic valve and replaces it with your pulmonary valve. Your pulmonary valve is then replaced with a pulmonary valve from a deceased humandonor. This is more involved surgery than typical valve replacement, and it has a greater risk of complications. The Ross procedure may be especially useful for children because the surgically replaced valves continue to grow with the child. Also, lifelong treatment with blood-thinning medicines isnt required. But in some patients, one or both valves fail to work well within a few years of the surgery. Researchers continue to study the use of this procedure. Other Approaches for Repairing and Replacing Heart Valves Some forms of heart valve repair and replacement surgery are less invasive than traditional surgery. These procedures use smaller incisions (cuts) to reach the heart valves. Hospital stays for these newer types of surgery usually are 3 to 5 days, compared with a 5-day stay for traditional heart valve surgery. New surgeries tend to cause less pain and have a lower risk of infection. Recovery time also tends to be shorter2to 4weeks versus 6to 8weeks for traditional surgery. Transcatheter Valve Therapy Interventional cardiologists perform procedures that involve threading clips or other devices to repair faulty heart valves using a catheter (tube) inserted through a large blood vessel. The clips or devices are used to reshape the valves and stop the backflow of blood. People who receive these clips recover more easily than people who have surgery. However, the clips may not treat backflow as well as surgery. Doctors also may use a catheter to replace faulty aortic valves. This procedure is called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). For this procedure, the catheter usually is inserted into an artery in the groin (upper thigh) and threaded to the heart. A deflated balloon with a folded replacement valve around it is at the end of the catheter. Once the replacement valve is placed properly, the balloon is used to expand the new valve so it fits securely within the old valve. The balloon is then deflated, and the balloon and catheter are removed. A replacement valve also can be inserted in an existing replacement valve that is failing. This is called a valve-in-valve procedure. Lifestyle Changes to Treat Other Related Heart To help treat heart conditions related to heart valve disease, your doctor may advise you to make heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as: Heart-healthy eating Maintaining a healthy weight Managing stress Physical activity Quitting smoking Heart-Healthy Eating Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include: Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating: A lot of red meat Palm and coconut oils Sugary foods and beverages Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise: Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats. Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples: AvocadosNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are: Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils Peanut butter Salmon and trout Tofu Sodium You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt. The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH. Alcohol Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weightgain. Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is: 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine 1 ounces of liquor Maintaining a Healthy Weight Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for heart valve disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active. Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI: Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range. Between 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight. Of 30.0 or higher is considered obese. A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal. Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk. If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol. Managing Stress Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as: A stress management program Meditation Physical activity Relaxation therapy Talking things out with friends or family Physical Activity Regular physical activity can lower many heart valve disease risk factors. Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week. Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. Read more about physical activity at: Physical Activity and Your Heart U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans Quitting Smoking If you smoke or use tobacco, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis and other health problems. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.

Normally, your lungs absorb oxygen from the air. However, some diseases and conditions can prevent you from getting enough oxygen. Oxygen therapy may help you function better and be more active. Oxygen is supplied in a metal cylinder or other container. It flows through a tube and is delivered to your lungs in one of the following ways: Through a nasal cannula, which consists of two small plastic tubes, or prongs, that are placed in both nostrils. Through a face mask, which fits over your nose and mouth. Through a small tube inserted into your windpipe through the front of your neck. Your doctor will use a needle or small incision (cut) to place the tube. Oxygen delivered this way is called transtracheal oxygen therapy. Oxygen therapy can be done in a hospital, another medical setting, or at home. If you need oxygen therapy for a chronic (ongoing) disease or condition, you might receive home oxygen therapy. Overview To learn how oxygen therapy works, it helps to understand how your respiratory system works. This system is a group of organs and tissues that help you breathe. The respiratory system includes the airways and lungs. The airways carry oxygen-rich air to your lungs. They also carry carbon dioxide (a waste gas) out of your lungs. Air enters your body through your nose or mouth, which moistens and warms the air. The air then travels through your voice box and down your windpipe. The windpipe divides into two tubes called bronchi that enter your lungs. Within your lungs, your bronchi branch into thousands of smaller, thinner tubes called bronchioles (BRONG-ke-ols). These tubes end in bunches of tiny round air sacs called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye). Each of the air sacs is covered in a mesh of tiny blood vessels called capillaries (KAP-ih-lare-ees). The capillaries connect to a network of arteries and veins that move blood throughout your body. When air reaches the air sacs, the oxygen in the air passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. The oxygen-rich blood then travels to the heart through the pulmonary vein and its branches. The heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood to your organs. (For more information, go to the Health Topics How the Lungs Work article.) Certain acute (short-term) and chronic (ongoing) diseases and conditions can affect the transfer of oxygen from the alveoli into the blood. Examples include pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Your doctor will decide whether you need oxygen therapy based on the results of tests, such as an arterial blood gas test and a pulse oximetry test. These tests measure how much oxygen is in your blood. A low oxygen level is a sign that you need oxygen therapy. Oxygen is considered a medicine, so your doctor must prescribe it. Outlook Oxygen therapy helps many people function better and be more active. It also may help: Decrease shortness of breath and fatigue (tiredness) Improve sleep in some people who have sleep-related breathing disorders Increase the lifespan of some people who have COPD Although you may need oxygen therapy long term, it doesn't have to limit your daily routine. Portable oxygen units can make it easier for you to move around and do many daily activities. Talk with your doctor if you have questions about whether certain activities are safe for you. A home equipment provider will work with you to make sure you have the supplies and equipment you need. Trained staff also will show you how to use the equipment correctly and safely. Oxygen therapy generally is safe, but it can pose a fire hazard. To use your oxygen safely, follow the instructions you receive from your home equipment provider."},{"prompt":"What is the outlook for Oxygen Therapy ?","completion":"During an emergencysuch as a serious accident, possible heart attack, or other life-threatening eventyou might be started on oxygen therapy right away. Otherwise, your doctor will decide whether you need oxygen therapy based on test results. An arterial blood gas test and a pulse oximetry test can measure the amount of oxygen in your blood. For an arterial blood gas test, a small needle is inserted into an artery, usually in your wrist. A sample of blood is taken from the artery. The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where its oxygen level is measured. For a pulse oximetry test, a small sensor is attached to your fingertip or toe. The sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood. If the tests show that your blood oxygen level is low, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy. In the prescription, your doctor will include the number of liters of oxygen per minute that you need (oxygen flow rate). He or she also will include how often you need to use the oxygen (frequency of use). Frequency of use includes when and for how long you should use the oxygen. Depending on your condition and blood oxygen level, you may need oxygen only at certain times, such as during sleep or while exercising. If your doctor prescribes home oxygen therapy, he or she can help you find a home equipment provider. The provider will give you the equipment and other supplies you need."},{"prompt":"What is the outlook for Oxygen Therapy ?","completion":"During an emergencysuch as a serious accident, possible heart attack, or other life-threatening eventyou might be started on oxygen therapy right away. While you're in the hospital, your doctor will check on you to make sure you're getting the right amount of oxygen. Nurses or respiratory therapists also may assist with the oxygen therapy. If you're having oxygen therapy at home, a home equipment provider will help you set up the oxygen therapy equipment at your house. Trained staff will show you how to use and take care of the equipment. They'll supply the oxygen and teach you how to safely handle it. Because oxygen poses a fire risk, you'll need to take certain safety steps. Oxygen isn't explosive, but it can worsen a fire. In the presence of oxygen, a small fire can quickly get out of control. Also, the cylinder that compressed oxygen gas comes in can explode if it's exposed to heat. Your home equipment provider will give you a complete list of safety steps that you'll need to follow at home and in public. For example, while on oxygen, you should: Never smoke or be around people who are smoking Never use paint thinners, cleaning fluids, gasoline, aerosol sprays, and other flammable materials Stay at least 5 feet away from gas stoves, candles, and other heat sources When you're not using the oxygen, keep it in a large, airy room. Never store compressed oxygen gas cylinders and liquid oxygen containers in small, enclosed places, such as in closets, behind curtains, or under clothes. Oxygen containers let off small amounts of oxygen. These small amounts can build up to harmful levels if they're allowed to escape into small spaces."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Oxygen Therapy? ?","completion":"Oxygen therapy can cause complications and side effects. These problems might include a dry or bloody nose, skin irritation from the nasal cannula or face mask, fatigue (tiredness), and morning headaches. If these problems persist, tell your doctor and home equipment provider. Depending on the problem, your doctor may need to change your oxygen flow rate or the length of time you're using the oxygen. If nose dryness is a problem, your doctor may recommend a nasal spray or have a humidifier added to your oxygen equipment. If you have an uncomfortable nasal cannula or face mask, your home equipment provider can help you find a device that fits better. Your provider also can recommend over-the-counter gels and devices that are designed to lessen skin irritation. Complications from transtracheal oxygen therapy can be more serious. With this type of oxygen therapy, oxygen is delivered through a tube inserted into your windpipe through the front of your neck. With transtracheal oxygen therapy: Mucus balls might develop on the tube inside the windpipe. Mucus balls tend to form as a result of the oxygen drying out the airways. Mucus balls can cause coughing and clog the windpipe or tube. Problems with the tube slipping or breaking. Infection. Injury to the lining of the windpipe. Proper medical care and correct handling of the tube and other supplies may reduce the risk of complications. Other Risks In certain people, oxygen therapy may suppress the drive to breathe, affecting how well the respiratory system works. This is managed by adjusting the oxygen flow rate. Oxygen poses a fire risk, so you'll need to take certain safety steps. Oxygen itself isn't explosive, but it can worsen a fire. In the presence of oxygen, a small fire can quickly get out of control. Also, the cylinder that compressed oxygen gas comes in might explode if exposed to heat. Your home equipment provider will give you a complete list of safety steps you'll need to take at home and when out in public. For example, when you're not using the oxygen, keep it in an airy room. Never store compressed oxygen gas cylinders and liquid oxygen containers in small, enclosed places, such as in closets, behind curtains, or under clothes. Oxygen containers let off small amounts of oxygen. These small amounts can build up to harmful levels if they're allowed to escape into small spaces."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Diabetic Heart Disease ?","completion":"The term \\"diabetic heart disease\\" (DHD) refers to heart disease that develops in people who have diabetes. Compared with people who don't have diabetes, people who have diabetes: Are at higher risk for heart disease Have additional causes of heart disease May develop heart disease at a younger age May have more severe heart disease What Is Diabetes? Diabetes is a disease in which the body's blood glucose (sugar) level is too high. Normally, the body breaks down food into glucose and carries it to cells throughout the body. The cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy. The two main types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2. In type 1 diabetes, the body doesn't make enough insulin. This causes the body's blood sugar level to rise. In type 2 diabetes, the body's cells don't use insulin properly (a condition called insulin resistance). At first, the body reacts by making more insulin. Over time, though, the body can't make enough insulin to control its blood sugar level. For more information about diabetes, go to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' Introduction to Diabetes Web page. What Heart Diseases Are Involved in Diabetic Heart Disease? DHD may include coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, and/or diabetic cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee). Coronary Heart Disease In CHD, a waxy substance called plaque (plak) builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply your heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood. Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis (ATH-er-o-skler-O-sis). Plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow. CHD can lead to chest pain or discomfort called angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh), irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), a heart attack, or even death. Heart Failure Heart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. The term heart failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. However, heart failure is a serious condition that requires medical care. If you have heart failure, you may tire easily and have to limit your activities. CHD can lead to heart failure by weakening the heart muscle over time. Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a disease that damages the structure and function of the heart. This disease can lead to heart failure and arrhythmias, even in people who have diabetes but don't have CHD. Overview People who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes can develop DHD. The higher a person's blood sugar level is, the higher his or her risk of DHD. Diabetes affects heart disease risk in three major ways. First, diabetes alone is a very serious risk factor for heart disease, just like smoking, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol. In fact, people who have type 2 diabetes have the same risk of heart attack and dying from heart disease as people who already have had heart attacks. Second, when combined with other risk factors, diabetes further raises the risk of heart disease. Although research is ongoing, it's clear that diabetes and other conditionssuch as overweight and obesity and metabolic syndromeinteract to cause harmful physical changes to the heart. Third, diabetes raises the risk of earlier and more severe heart problems. Also, people who have DHD tend to have less success with some heart disease treatments, such as coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention,also known as coronary angioplasty. Outlook If you have diabetes, you can lower your risk of DHD. Making lifestyle changes and taking prescribed medicines can help you prevent or control many risk factors. Taking action to manage multiple risk factors helps improve your outlook. The good news is that many lifestyle changes help control multiple risk factors. For example, physical activity can lower your blood pressure, help control your blood sugar level and your weight, and reduce stress. It's also very important to follow your treatment plan for diabetes and see your doctor for ongoing care. If you already have DHD, follow your treatment plan as your doctors advises. This may help you avoid or delay serious problems, such as a heart attack or heart failure."},{"prompt":"What causes Diabetic Heart Disease ?","completion":"At least four complex processes, alone or combined, can lead to diabetic heart disease (DHD). They include coronary atherosclerosis; metabolic syndrome; insulin resistance in people who have type 2 diabetes; and the interaction of coronary heart disease (CHD), high blood pressure, and diabetes. Researchers continue to study these processes because all of the details aren't yet known. Coronary Atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside the arteries. The exact cause of atherosclerosis isn't known. However, studies show that it is a slow, complex disease that may start in childhood. The disease develops faster as you age. Coronary atherosclerosis may start when certain factors damage the inner layers of the coronary (heart) arteries. These factors include: Smoking High amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood High blood pressure High amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes Plaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows the arteries. This reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle. Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). When this happens, blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) stick to the site of the injury. They may clump together to form blood clots. Blood clots narrow the coronary arteries even more. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart and may worsen angina (chest pain) or cause a heart attack. Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk of both CHD and type 2 diabetes. If you have three or more of the five metabolic risk factors, you have metabolic syndrome. The risk factors are: A large waistline (a waist measurement of 35 inches or more for women and 40 inches or more for men). A high triglyceride (tri-GLIH-seh-ride) level (or youre on medicine to treat high triglycerides). Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. A low HDL cholesterol level (or you're on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol). HDL sometimes is called \\"good\\" cholesterol. This is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. High blood pressure (or youre on medicine to treat high blood pressure). A high fasting blood sugar level (or you're on medicine to treat high blood sugar). It's unclear whether these risk factors have a common cause or are mainly related by their combined effects on the heart. Obesity seems to set the stage for metabolic syndrome. Obesity can cause harmful changes in body fats and how the body uses insulin. Chronic (ongoing) inflammation also may occur in people who have metabolic syndrome. Inflammation is the body's response to illness or injury. It may raise your risk of CHD and heart attack. Inflammation also may contribute to or worsen metabolic syndrome. Research is ongoing to learn more about metabolic syndrome and how metabolic risk factors interact. Insulin Resistance in People Who Have Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance means that the body can't properly use the insulin it makes. People who have type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance have higher levels of substances in the blood that cause blood clots. Blood clots can block the coronary arteries and cause a heart attack or even death. The Interaction of Coronary Heart Disease, High Blood Pressure, and Diabetes Each of these risk factors alone can damage the heart. CHD reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle. High blood pressure and diabetes may cause harmful changes in the structure and function of the heart. Having CHD, high blood pressure, and diabetes is even more harmful to the heart. Together, these conditions can severely damage the heart muscle. As a result, the heart has to work harder than normal. Over time, the heart weakens and isnt able to pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs. This condition is called heart failure. As the heart weakens, the body may release proteins and other substances into the blood. These proteins and substances also can harm the heart and worsen heart failure."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Diabetic Heart Disease? ?","completion":"People who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes are at risk for diabetic heart disease (DHD). Diabetes affects heart disease risk in three major ways. First, diabetes alone is a very serious risk factor for heart disease. Second, when combined with other risk factors, diabetes further raises the risk of heart disease. Third, compared with people who don't have diabetes, people who have the disease are more likely to: Have heart attacks and other heart and blood vessel diseases. In men, the risk is double; in women, the risk is triple. Have more complications after a heart attack, such as angina (chest pain or discomfort) and heart failure. Die from heart disease. The higher your blood sugar level is, the higher your risk of DHD. (A higher than normal blood sugar level is a risk factor for heart disease even in people who don't have diabetes.) Type 2 diabetes raises your risk of having silent heart diseasethat is, heart disease with no signs or symptoms. You can even have a heart attack without feeling symptoms. Diabetes-related nerve damage that blunts heart pain may explain why symptoms aren't noticed. Other Risk Factors Other factors also can raise the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in people who have diabetes and in those who don't. You can control most of these risk factors, but some you can't. For a more detailed discussion of these risk factors, go to the Health Topics Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors article. Risk Factors You Can Control Unhealthy blood cholesterol levels. This includes high LDL cholesterol (sometimes called \\"bad\\" cholesterol) and low HDL cholesterol (sometimes called \\"good\\" cholesterol). High blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.) Smoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels, lead to unhealthy cholesterol levels, and raise blood pressure. Smoking also can limit how much oxygen reaches the body's tissues. Prediabetes. This is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not as high as it is in diabetes. If you have prediabetes and don't take steps to manage it, you'll likely develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years. Overweight or obesity. Being overweight or obese raises your risk of heart disease and heart attack. Overweight and obesity also are linked to other heart disease risk factors, such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Most people who have type 2 diabetes are overweight. Metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Metabolic syndrome also raises your risk of other health problems, such as stroke. Lack of physical activity. Lack of physical activity can worsen other risk factors for heart disease, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, and overweight or obesity. Unhealthy diet. An unhealthy diet can raise your risk of heart disease. Foods that are high in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and sugar can worsen other heart disease risk factors. Stress. Stress and anxiety can trigger your arteries to tighten. This can raise your blood pressure and your risk of having a heart attack. Stress also may indirectly raise your risk of heart disease if it makes you more likely to smoke or overeat foods high in fat and sugar. Risk Factors You Can't Control Age. As you get older, your risk of heart disease and heart attack rises. In men, the risk of heart disease increases after age 45. In women, the risk increases after age 55. In people who have diabetes, the risk of heart disease increases after age 40. Gender. Before age 55, women seem to have a lower risk of heart disease than men. After age 55, however, the risk of heart disease increases similarly in both women and men. Family history of early heart disease. Your risk increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with heart disease before 65 years of age. Preeclampsia (pre-e-KLAMP-se-ah). This condition can develop during pregnancy. The two main signs of preeclampsia are a rise in blood pressure and excess protein in the urine. Preeclampsia is linked to an increased lifetime risk of CHD, heart attack, heart failure, and high blood pressure."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Diabetic Heart Disease ?","completion":"Some people who have diabetic heart disease (DHD) may have no signs or symptoms of heart disease. This is called silent heart disease. Diabetes-related nerve damage that blunts heart pain may explain why symptoms aren't noticed. Thus, people who have diabetes should have regular medical checkups. Tests may reveal a problem before they're aware of it. Early treatment can reduce or delay related problems. Some people who have DHD will have some or all of the typical symptoms of heart disease. Be aware of the symptoms described below and seek medical care if you have them. If you think you're having a heart attack, call 911 right away for emergency care. Treatment for a heart attack works best when it's given right after symptoms occur. Coronary Heart Disease A common symptom of coronary heart disease (CHD) is angina. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs if your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. Angina may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. You also may feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion. The pain tends to get worse with activity and go away with rest. Emotional stress also can trigger the pain. See your doctor if you think you have angina. He or she may recommend tests to check your coronary arteries and to see whether you have CHD risk factors. Other CHD signs and symptoms include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), fatigue (tiredness), shortness of breath, sweating, light-headedness, and weakness. Some people don't realize they have CHD until they have a heart attack. A heart attack occurs if a blood clot forms in a coronary artery and blocks blood flow to part of the heart muscle. The most common heart attack symptom is chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest that often lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. The discomfort can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. The feeling can be mild or severe. Heart attack pain sometimes feels like indigestion or heartburn. Shortness of breath may occur with or before chest discomfort. Heart attacks also can cause upper body discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach. Other heart attack symptoms include nausea, vomiting, light-headedness or sudden dizziness, breaking out in a cold sweat, sleep problems, fatigue, and lack of energy. Some heart attack symptoms are similar to angina symptoms. Angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest. Chest pain or discomfort that doesn't go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while you're resting) can be a sign of a heart attack. If you don't know whether your chest pain is angina or a heart attack, call 911 right away for emergency care. Not everyone who has a heart attack has typical symptoms. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one. Also, diabetes-related nerve damage can interfere with pain signals in the body. As a result, some people who have diabetes may have heart attacks without symptoms. Heart Failure The most common symptoms of heart failure are shortness of breath or trouble breathing, fatigue, and swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, and veins in your neck. As the heart weakens, heart failure symptoms worsen. People who have heart failure can live longer and more active lives if the condition is diagnosed early and they follow their treatment plans. If you have any form of DHD, talk with your doctor about your risk of heart failure. Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Diabetic cardiomyopathy may not cause symptoms in its early stages. Later, you may have weakness, shortness of breath, a severe cough, fatigue, and swelling of the legs and feet."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Diabetic Heart Disease ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose diabetic heart disease (DHD) based on your signs and symptoms, medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures. Doctors and researchers are still trying to find out whether routine testing for DHD will benefit people who have diabetes but no heart disease symptoms. Initial Tests No single test can diagnose DHD, which may involve coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, and/or diabetic cardiomyopathy. Initially, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests. Blood Pressure Measurement To measure your blood pressure, your doctor or nurse will use some type of a gauge, a stethoscope (or electronic sensor), and a blood pressure cuff. Most often, you'll sit or lie down with the cuff around your arm as your doctor or nurse checks your blood pressure. If he or she doesn't tell you what your blood pressure numbers are, you should ask. Blood Tests Blood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood. Abnormal levels of these substances may show that you're at risk for DHD. A blood test also can check the level of a hormone called BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) in your blood. The heart makes BNP, and the level of BNP rises during heart failure. Chest X Ray A chest x ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can reveal signs of heart failure. EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart. An EKG can show signs of heart damage due to CHD and signs of a previous or current heart attack. Stress Test Some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. Stress testing gives your doctor information about how your heart works during physical stress. During a stress test, you exercise (walk or run on a treadmill or pedal a bicycle) to make your heart work hard and beat fast. Tests are done on your heart while you exercise. If you cant exercise, you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate. Urinalysis For this test, you'll give a sample of urine for analysis. The sample is checked for abnormal levels of protein or blood cells. In people who have diabetes, protein in the urine is a risk factor for DHD. Other Tests and Procedures Your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist if your initial test results suggest that you have a form of DHD. A cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions. The cardiologist may recommend other tests or procedures to get more detailed information about the nature and extent of your DHD. For more information about other tests and procedures, go to the diagnosis sections of the Health Topics Coronary Heart Disease, Heart Failure, and Cardiomyopathy articles."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Diabetic Heart Disease ?","completion":"Diabetic heart disease (DHD) is treated with lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures. The goals of treating DHD include: Controlling diabetes and any other heart disease risk factors you have, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels and high blood pressure Reducing or relieving heart disease symptoms, such as angina (chest pain or discomfort) Preventing or delaying heart disease complications, such as a heart attack Repairing heart and coronary artery damage Following the treatment plan your doctor recommends is very important. Compared with people who don't have diabetes, people who have the disease are at higher risk for heart disease, have additional causes of heart disease, may develop heart disease at a younger age, and may have more severe heart disease. Taking action to manage multiple risk factors helps improve your outlook. The good news is that many lifestyle changes help control multiple risk factors. Lifestyle Changes Following a healthy lifestyle is an important part of treating diabetes and DHD. Some people who have diabetes can manage their blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels with lifestyle changes alone. Following a Healthy Diet A healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits. It also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, processed soy products, nuts, seeds, beans, and peas. A healthy diet is low in sodium (salt), added sugars, solid fats, and refined grains. Solid fats are saturated fat and trans fatty acids. Refined grains come from processing whole grains, which results in a loss of nutrients (such as dietary fiber). For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH and the U.S. Department of Agricultures ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating. Maintaining a Healthy Weight Controlling your weight helps you control heart disease risk factors. If youre overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan. For more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, go to the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article. Being Physically Active Regular physical activity can lower many heart disease risk factors, and it helps control your blood sugar level. Physical activity also can improve how insulin works. (Insulin is a hormone that helps turn glucose into energy.) Generally, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity physical activity each week. You dont have to do the activity all at once. You can break it up into shorter periods of at least 10 minutes each. Talk with your doctor about what types and amounts and physical activity are safe for you. People who have diabetes must be careful to watch their blood sugar levels and avoid injury to their feet during physical activity. For more information about physical activity, go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' \\"2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,\\" the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article, and the NHLBI's \\"Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.\\" Quitting Smoking Smoking can damage your blood vessels and raise your risk of heart disease. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the NHLBI's \\"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\\" Managing Stress Research shows that strong emotions, such as anger, can trigger a heart attack. Learning how to managestress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Medicines Medicines are an important part of treatment for people who have diabetes and for people who have DHD. Medicines can help control blood sugar levels, lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of blood clots, improve blood cholesterol levels, reduce the heart's workload, and treat angina symptoms. Your doctor will prescribe medicines based on your specific needs. Medical Procedures If you have DHD, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure. The type of procedure will depend on the type of heart disease you have. For example, both percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),also known as coronaryangioplasty, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are used to treat coronary heart disease (CHD). Both of these procedures improve blood flow to your heart. PCI also can relieve chest pain. CABG can relieve chest pain and may help prevent a heart attack. If you have heart damage and severe heart failure symptoms, your doctor may recommend a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). A CRT device is a type of pacemaker. A pacemaker is a small device that helps control abnormal heart rhythms. Its placed under the skin of the chest or abdomen. A CRT device helps the heart's lower chambers contract at the same time, which may decrease heart failure symptoms. An ICD is similar to a pacemaker. An ICD is a small device thats placed under the skin of the chest or abdomen. The device uses electrical pulses or shocks to help control dangerous heart rhythms. Your doctor also may recommend a pacemaker or ICD to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy. Other types of surgery also are used to treat this type of heart disease. For more information about medical procedures used to treat diabetes-related heart diseases, go to the treatment sections of the Health Topics Coronary Heart Disease, Heart Failure, and Cardiomyopathy articles. Diabetes-Specific Treatment Issues The treatments described above are used for people who have DHD and for people who have heart disease without diabetes. However, some aspects of heart disease treatment differ for people who have diabetes. Treatment for High Blood Pressure and High Blood Cholesterol Treatment for high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol often begins earlier in people who have diabetes than in those who don't. People who have diabetes also may have more aggressive treatment goals. For example, your doctor may prescribe medicines called statins even if your blood cholesterol levels are in the normal range. Your doctor also may prescribe statins if you're older than 40 and have other heart disease risk factors. Target goals for LDL cholesterol (sometimes called \\"bad\\" cholesterol) and high blood pressure also are lower for people who have diabetes than for those who don't. Studies suggest that most people who have diabetes will need more than one blood pressure medicine to reach their goals. Research also has shown that some people who have diabetes may benefit more from certain blood pressure and cholesterol medicines than from others. One example is a group of cholesterol medicines called bile acid sequestrants (such as cholestyramine). This type of medicine may offer advantages for people who have type 2 diabetes. It appears to improve blood sugar control and lower LDL cholesterol. Treatment for Heart Failure Some studies suggest that certain medicines may have advantages for treating heart failure in people who have diabetes. These medicines include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and beta blockers. Research shows that two blood sugar medicines (insulin and sulfanylureas) don't seem to reduce the risk of heart failure in people who have type 2 diabetes. A third medicine (metformin) shows promise, but research is still ongoing. Heart Attack Prevention Doctors may recommend aspirin for people with diabetes who are at increased risk for heart disease and heart attack. Taken each day, low-dose aspirin may prevent blood clots that can lead to a heart attack. People with diabetes who are at increased risk include most men older than 50 and most women older than 60 who have one or more of the following risk factors: Smoking High blood pressure High blood cholesterol A family history of early heart disease A higher than normal level of protein in their urine Blood Sugar Control Controlling blood sugar levels is good for heart health. For example, controlling blood sugar improves everyday heart function for people who have diabetes and heart failure."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Diabetic Heart Disease ?","completion":"Taking action to control risk factors can help prevent or delay heart disease in people who have diabetes and in those who don't. Your risk of heart disease increases with the number of risk factors you have. One step you can take is to adopt a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle should be part of a lifelong approach to healthy living. A healthy lifestyle includes: Following a healthy diet Maintaining a healthy weight Being physically active Quitting smoking Managing stress You also should know your family history of diabetes and heart disease. If you or someone in your family has diabetes, heart disease, or both, let your doctor know. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to control certain risk factors, such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol. Take all of your medicines exactly as your doctor advises.

This lining is called the endocardium (en-do-KAR-de-um). The condition also is called infective endocarditis (IE). The term \\"endocarditis\\" also is used to describe an inflammation of the endocardium due to other conditions. This article only discusses endocarditis related to infection. IE occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart. The infection can damage your heart and cause serious and sometimes fatal complications. IE can develop quickly or slowly; it depends on what type of germ is causing it and whether you have an underlying heart problem. When IE develops quickly, it's called acute infective endocarditis. When it develops slowly, it's called subacute infective endocarditis. Overview IE mainly affects people who have: Damaged or artificial (man-made) heart valves Congenital heart defects (defects present at birth) Implanted medical devices in the heart or blood vessels People who have normal heart valves also can have IE. However, the condition is much more common in people who have abnormal hearts. Certain factors make it easier for bacteria to enter your bloodstream. These factors put you at higher risk for IE. For example, poor dental hygiene and unhealthy teeth and gums increase your risk for the infection. Other risk factors include using intravenous (IV) drugs, having a catheter (tube) or another medical device in your body for long periods, and having a history of IE. Common symptoms of IE are fever and other flu-like symptoms. Because the infection can affect people in different ways, the signs and symptoms vary. IE also can cause problems in many other parts of the body besides the heart. If you're at high risk for IE, seek medical care if you have signs or symptoms of the infection, especially a fever that persists or unexplained fatigue (tiredness). Outlook IE is treated with antibiotics for several weeks. You also may need heart surgery to repair or replace heart valves or remove infected heart tissue. Most people who are treated with the proper antibiotics recover. But if the infection isn't treated, or if it persists despite treatment (for example, if the bacteria are resistant to antibiotics), it's usually fatal. If you have signs or symptoms of IE, see your doctor as soon as you can, especially if you have abnormal heart valves."},{"prompt":"What causes Endocarditis ?","completion":"Infective endocarditis (IE) occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart. Certain factors increase the risk of this happening. A common underlying factor in IE is a structural heart defect, especially faulty heart valves. Usually your immune system will kill germs in your bloodstream. However, if your heart has a rough lining or abnormal valves, the invading germs can attach and multiply in the heart. Other factors also can play a role in causing IE. Common activities, such as brushing your teeth or having certain dental procedures, can allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream. This is even more likely to happen if your teeth and gums are in poor condition. Having a catheter (tube) or another medical device inserted through your skin, especially for long periods, also can allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream. People who use intravenous (IV) drugs also are at risk for IE because of the germs on needles and syringes. Bacteria also may spread to the blood and heart from infections in other parts of the body, such as the gut, skin, or genitals. Endocarditis Complications As the bacteria or other germs multiply in your heart, they form clumps with other cells and matter found in the blood. These clumps are called vegetations (vej-eh-TA-shuns). As IE worsens, pieces of the vegetations can break off and travel to almost any other organ or tissue in the body. There, the pieces can block blood flow or cause a new infection. As a result, IE can cause a range of complications. Heart Complications Heart problems are the most common complication of IE. They occur in one-third to one-half of all people who have the infection. These problems may include a new heart murmur, heart failure, heart valve damage, heart block, or, rarely, a heart attack. Central Nervous System Complications These complications occur in as many as 20 to 40 percent of people who have IE. Central nervous system complications most often occur when bits of the vegetation, called emboli (EM-bo-li), break away and lodge in the brain. The emboli can cause local infections called brain abscesses. Or, they can cause a more widespread brain infection called meningitis (men-in-JI-tis). Emboli also can cause strokes or seizures. This happens if they block blood vessels or affect the brain's electrical signals. These complications can cause long-term damage to the brain and may even be fatal. Complications in Other Organs IE also can affect other organs in the body, such as the lungs, kidneys, and spleen. Lungs. The lungs are especially at risk when IE affects the right side of the heart. This is called right-sided infective endocarditis. A vegetation or blood clot going to the lungs can cause a pulmonary embolism (PE) and lung damage. A PE is a sudden blockage in a lung artery. Other lung complications include pneumonia and a buildup of fluid or pus around the lungs. Kidneys. IE can cause kidney abscesses and kidney damage. The infection also can inflame the internal filtering structures of the kidneys. Signs and symptoms of kidney complications include back or side pain, blood in the urine, or a change in the color or amount of urine. In some cases, IE can cause kidney failure. Spleen. The spleen is an organ located in the left upper part of the abdomen near the stomach. In some people who have IE, the spleen enlarges (especially in people who have long-term IE). Sometimes emboli also can damage the spleen. Signs and symptoms of spleen problems include pain or discomfort in the upper left abdomen and/or left shoulder, a feeling of fullness or the inability to eat large meals, and hiccups."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Endocarditis? ?","completion":"Infective endocarditis (IE) is an uncommon condition that can affect both children and adults. It's more common in men than women. IE typically affects people who have abnormal hearts or other conditions that put them at risk for the infection. Sometimes IE does affect people who were healthy before the infection. Major Risk Factors The germs that cause IE tend to attach and multiply on damaged, malformed, or artificial (man-made) heart valves and implanted medical devices. Certain conditions put you at higher risk for IE. These include: Congenital heart defects (defects that are present at birth). Examples include a malformed heart or abnormal heart valves. Artificial heart valves, an implanted medical device in the heart (such as a pacemaker wire), or an intravenous (IV) catheter (tube) in a blood vessel for a long time. Heart valves damaged by rheumatic fever or calcium deposits that cause age-related valve thickening. Scars in the heart from a previous case of IE also can damage heart valves. IV drug use, especially if needles are shared or reused, contaminated substances are injected, or the skin isn't properly cleaned before injection."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Endocarditis ?","completion":"Infective endocarditis (IE) can cause a range of signs and symptoms that can vary from person to person. Signs and symptoms also can vary over time in the same person. Signs and symptoms differ depending on whether you have an underlying heart problem, the type of germ causing the infection, and whether you have acute or subacute IE. Signs and symptoms of IE may include: Flu-like symptoms, such as fever, chills, fatigue (tiredness), aching muscles and joints, night sweats, and headaches. Shortness of breath or a cough that won't go away. A new heart murmur or a change in an existing heart murmur. Skin changes such as: - Overall paleness. - Small, painful, red or purplish bumps under the skin on the fingers or toes. - Small, dark, painless flat spots on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. - Tiny spots under the fingernails, on the whites of the eyes, on the roof of the mouth and inside of the cheeks, or on the chest. These spots are from broken blood vessels. Overall paleness. Small, painful, red or purplish bumps under the skin on the fingers or toes. Small, dark, painless flat spots on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. Tiny spots under the fingernails, on the whites of the eyes, on the roof of the mouth and inside of the cheeks, or on the chest. These spots are from broken blood vessels. Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), vomiting, a decrease in appetite, a sense of fullness with discomfort on the upper left side of the abdomen, or weight loss with or without a change in appetite. Blood in the urine. Swelling in the feet, legs, or abdomen."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Endocarditis ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose infective endocarditis (IE) based on your risk factors, your medical history and signs and symptoms, and test results. Diagnosis of IE often is based on many factors, rather than a single positive test result, sign, or symptom. Diagnostic Tests Blood Tests Blood cultures are the most important blood tests used to diagnose IE. Blood is drawn several times over a 24-hour period. It's put in special culture bottles that allow bacteria to grow. Doctors then identify and test the bacteria to see which antibiotics will kill them. Sometimes the blood cultures don't grow any bacteria, even if a person has IE. This is called culture-negative endocarditis, and it requires antibiotic treatment. Other blood tests also are used to diagnose IE. For example, a complete blood count may be used to check the number of red and white blood cells in your blood. Blood tests also may be used to check your immune system and to check for inflammation. Echocardiography Echocardiography (echo) is a painless test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart. Two types of echo are useful in diagnosing IE. Transthoracic (tranz-thor-AS-ik) echo. For this painless test, gel is applied to the skin on your chest. A device called a transducer is moved around on the outside of your chest. This device sends sound waves called ultrasound through your chest. As the ultrasound waves bounce off your heart, a computer converts them into pictures on a screen. Your doctor uses the pictures to look for vegetations, areas of infected tissue (such as an abscess), and signs of heart damage. Because the sound waves have to pass through skin, muscle, tissue, bone, and lungs, the pictures may not have enough detail. Thus, your doctor may recommend transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo (TEE). Transesophageal echo. For TEE, a much smaller transducer is attached to the end of a long, narrow, flexible tube. The tube is passed down your throat. Before the procedure, you're given medicine to help you relax, and your throat is sprayed with numbing medicine. The doctor then passes the transducer down your esophagus (the passage from your mouth to your stomach). Because this passage is right behind the heart, the transducer can get detailed pictures of the heart's structures. EKG An EKG is a simple, painless test that detects your heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast your heart is beating, whether your heart rhythm is steady or irregular, and the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart. An EKG typically isn't used to diagnose IE. However, it may be done to see whether IE is affecting your heart's electrical activity. For this test, soft, sticky patches called electrodes are attached to your chest, arms, and legs. You lie still while the electrodes detect your heart's electrical signals. A machine records these signals on graph paper or shows them on a computer screen. The entire test usually takes about 10 minutes."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Endocarditis ?","completion":"Infective endocarditis (IE) is treated with antibiotics and sometimes with heart surgery. Antibiotics Antibiotics usually are given for 2 to 6 weeks through an intravenous (IV) line inserted into a vein. You're often in a hospital for at least the first week or more of treatment. This allows your doctor to make sure the medicine is helping. If you're allowed to go home before the treatment is done, the antibiotics are almost always continued by vein at home. You'll need special care if you get IV antibiotic treatment at home. Before you leave the hospital, your medical team will arrange for you to receive home-based care so you can continue your treatment. You also will need close medical followup, usually by a team of doctors. This team often includes a doctor who specializes in infectious diseases, a cardiologist (heart specialist), and a heart surgeon. Surgery Sometimes surgery is needed to repair or replace a damaged heart valve or to help clear up IE. For example, IE caused by fungi often requires surgery. This is because this type of IE is harder to treat than IE caused by bacteria."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Endocarditis ?","completion":"If you're at risk for infective endocarditis (IE), you can take steps to prevent the infection and its complications. Be alert to the signs and symptoms of IE. Contact your doctor right away if you have any of these signs or symptoms, especially a persistent fever or unexplained fatigue (tiredness). Brush and floss your teeth regularly, and have regular dental checkups. Germs from a gum infection can enter your bloodstream. Avoid body piercing, tattoos, and other procedures that may allow germs to enter your bloodstream. Research shows that not everyone at risk for IE needs to take antibiotics before routine dental exams and certain other dental and medical procedures. Let your health care providers, including your dentist, know if you're at risk for IE. They can tell you whether you need antibiotics before exams and procedures."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Hemophilia ?","completion":"Espaol Hemophilia (heem-o-FILL-ee-ah) is a rare bleeding disorder in which the blood doesn't clot normally. If you have hemophilia, you may bleed for a longer time than others after an injury. You also may bleed inside your body (internally), especially in your knees, ankles, and elbows. This bleeding can damage your organs and tissues and may be life threatening. Overview Hemophilia usually is inherited. \\"Inherited means that the disorder is passed from parents to children through genes. People born with hemophilia have little or no clotting factor. Clotting factor is a protein needed for normal blood clotting. There are several types of clotting factors. These proteins work with platelets (PLATE-lets) to help the blood clot. Platelets are small blood cell fragments that form in the bone marrowa sponge-like tissue in the bones. Platelets play a major role in blood clotting. When blood vessels are injured, clotting factors help platelets stick together to plug cuts and breaks on the vessels and stop bleeding. The two main types of hemophilia are A and B. If you have hemophilia A, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor VIII (8). About 8 out of 10 people who have hemophilia have type A. If you have hemophilia B, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor IX (9). Rarely, hemophilia can be acquired. \\"Acquired means you aren't born with the disorder, but you develop it during your lifetime. This can happen if your body forms antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factors in your bloodstream. The antibodies can prevent the clotting factors from working. This article focuses on inherited hemophilia. Outlook Hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how much clotting factor is in your blood. About 7 out of 10 people who have hemophilia A have the severe form of the disorder. People who don't have hemophilia have a factor VIII activity of 100 percent. People who have severe hemophilia A have a factor VIII activity of less than 1 percent. Hemophilia usually occurs in males (with rare exceptions). About 1 in 5,000 males are born with hemophilia each year."},{"prompt":"What causes Hemophilia ?","completion":"A defect in one of the genes that determines how the body makes blood clotting factor VIII or IX causes hemophilia. These genes are located on the X chromosomes (KRO-muh-somz). Chromosomes come in pairs. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Only the X chromosome carries the genes related to clotting factors. A male who has a hemophilia gene on his X chromosome will have hemophilia. When a female has a hemophilia gene on only one of her X chromosomes, she is a \\"hemophilia carrier and can pass the gene to her children. Sometimes carriers have low levels of clotting factor and have symptoms of hemophilia, including bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins in the blood that work together with platelets to stop or control bleeding. Very rarely, a girl may be born with a very low clotting factor level and have a greater risk for bleeding, similar to boys who have hemophilia and very low levels of clotting factor. There are several hereditary and genetic causes of this much rarer form of hemophilia in females. Some males who have the disorder are born to mothers who aren't carriers. In these cases, a mutation (random change) occurs in the gene as it is passed to the child. Below are two examples of how the hemophilia gene is inherited. Inheritance Pattern for HemophiliaExample 1 Each daughter has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from her mother and being a carrier. Each son has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from his mother and having hemophilia. Inheritance Pattern for HemophiliaExample 2 Each daughter will inherit the hemophilia gene from her father and be a carrier. None of the sons will inherit the hemophilia gene from their father; thus, none will have hemophilia."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Hemophilia ?","completion":"The major signs and symptoms of hemophilia are excessive bleeding and easy bruising. Excessive Bleeding The extent of bleeding depends on how severe the hemophilia is. Children who have mild hemophilia may not have signs unless they have excessive bleeding from a dental procedure, an accident, or surgery. Males who have severe hemophilia may bleed heavily after circumcision. Bleeding can occur on the body's surface (external bleeding) or inside the body (internal bleeding). Signs of external bleeding may include: Bleeding in the mouth from a cut or bite or from cutting or losing a tooth Nosebleeds for no obvious reason Heavy bleeding from a minor cut Bleeding from a cut that resumes after stopping for a short time Signs of internal bleeding may include: Blood in the urine (from bleeding in the kidneys or bladder) Blood in the stool (from bleeding in the intestines or stomach) Large bruises (from bleeding into the large muscles of the body) Bleeding in the Joints Bleeding in the knees, elbows, or other joints is another common form of internal bleeding in people who have hemophilia. This bleeding can occur without obvious injury. At first, the bleeding causes tightness in the joint with no real pain or any visible signs of bleeding. The joint then becomes swollen, hot to touch, and painful to bend. Swelling continues as bleeding continues. Eventually, movement in the joint is temporarily lost. Pain can be severe. Joint bleeding that isn't treated quickly can damage the joint. Bleeding in the Brain Internal bleeding in the brain is a very serious complication of hemophilia. It can happen after a simple bump on the head or a more serious injury. The signs and symptoms of bleeding in the brain include: Long-lasting, painful headaches or neck pain or stiffness Repeated vomiting Sleepiness or changes in behavior Sudden weakness or clumsiness of the arms or legs or problems walking Double vision Convulsions or seizures"},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Hemophilia ?","completion":"If you or your child appears to have a bleeding problem, your doctor will ask about your personal and family medical histories. This will reveal whether you or your family members, including women and girls, have bleeding problems. However, some people who have hemophilia have no recent family history of the disease. You or your child also will likely have a physical exam and blood tests to diagnose hemophilia. Blood tests are used to find out: How long it takes for your blood to clot Whether your blood has low levels of any clotting factors Whether any clotting factors are completely missing from your blood The test results will show whether you have hemophilia, what type of hemophilia you have, and how severe it is. Hemophilia A and B are classified as mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the amount of clotting factor VIII or IX in the blood. The severity of symptoms can overlap between the categories. For example, some people who have mild hemophilia may have bleeding problems almost as often or as severe as some people who have moderate hemophilia. Severe hemophilia can cause serious bleeding problems in babies. Thus, children who have severe hemophilia usually are diagnosed during the first year of life. People who have milder forms of hemophilia may not be diagnosed until they're adults. The bleeding problems of hemophilia A and hemophilia B are the same. Only special blood tests can tell which type of the disorder you or your child has. Knowing which type is important because the treatments are different. Pregnant women who are known hemophilia carriers can have the disorder diagnosed in their unborn babies as early as 12 weeks into their pregnancies. Women who are hemophilia carriers also can have \\"preimplantation diagnosis\\" to have children who don't have hemophilia. For this process, women have their eggs removed and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory. The embryos are then tested for hemophilia. Only embryos without the disorder are implanted in the womb."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Hemophilia ?","completion":"Treatment With Replacement Therapy The main treatment for hemophilia is called replacement therapy. Concentrates of clotting factor VIII (for hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (for hemophilia B) are slowly dripped or injected into a vein. These infusions help replace the clotting factor that's missing or low. Clotting factor concentrates can be made from human blood. The blood is treated to prevent the spread of diseases, such as hepatitis. With the current methods of screening and treating donated blood, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small. To further reduce the risk, you or your child can take clotting factor concentrates that aren't made from human blood. These are called recombinant clotting factors. Clotting factors are easy to store, mix, and use at homeit only takes about 15 minutes to receive the factor. You may have replacement therapy on a regular basis to prevent bleeding. This is called preventive or prophylactic (PRO-fih-lac-tik) therapy. Or, you may only need replacement therapy to stop bleeding when it occurs. This use of the treatment, on an as-needed basis, is called demand therapy. Demand therapy is less intensive and expensive than preventive therapy. However, there's a risk that bleeding will cause damage before you receive the demand therapy. Complications of Replacement Therapy Complications of replacement therapy include: Developing antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factor Developing viral infections from human clotting factors Damage to joints, muscles, or other parts of the body resulting from delays in treatment Antibodies to the clotting factor. Antibodies can destroy the clotting factor before it has a chance to work. This is a very serious problem. It prevents the main treatment for hemophilia (replacement therapy) from working. These antibodies, also called inhibitors, develop in about 2030 percent of people who have severe hemophilia A. Inhibitors develop in 25 percent of people who have hemophilia B. When antibodies develop, doctors may use larger doses of clotting factor or try different clotting factor sources. Sometimes the antibodies go away. Researchers are studying new ways to deal with antibodies to clotting factors. Viruses from human clotting factors. Clotting factors made from human blood can carry the viruses that cause HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. However, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small due to: Careful screening of blood donors Testing of donated blood products Treating donated blood products with a detergent and heat to destroy viruses Vaccinating people who have hemophilia for hepatitis A and B Damage to joints, muscles, and other parts of the body. Delays in treatment can cause damage such as: Bleeding into a joint. If this happens many times, it can lead to changes in the shape of the joint and impair the joint's function. Swelling of the membrane around a joint. Pain, swelling, and redness of a joint. Pressure on a joint from swelling, which can destroy the joint. Home Treatment With Replacement Therapy You can do both preventive (ongoing) and demand (as-needed) replacement therapy at home. Many people learn to do the infusions at home for their child or for themselves. Home treatment has several advantages: You or your child can get quicker treatment when bleeding happens. Early treatment lowers the risk of complications. Fewer visits to the doctor or emergency room are needed. Home treatment costs less than treatment in a medical care setting. Home treatment helps children accept treatment and take responsibility for their own health. Discuss options for home treatment with your doctor or your child's doctor. A doctor or other health care provider can teach you the steps and safety procedures for home treatment. Hemophilia treatment centers are another good resource for learning about home treatment (discussed in \\"Living With Hemophilia). Doctors can surgically implant vein access devices to make it easier for you to access a vein for treatment with replacement therapy. These devices can be helpful if treatment occurs often. However, infections can be a problem with these devices. Your doctor can help you decide whether this type of device is right for you or your child. Other Types of Treatment Desmopressin Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a man-made hormone used to treat people who have mild hemophilia A. DDAVP isn't used to treat hemophilia B or severe hemophilia A. DDAVP stimulates the release of stored factor VIII and von Willebrand factor; it also increases the level of these proteins in your blood. Von Willebrand factor carries and binds factor VIII, which can then stay in the bloodstream longer. DDAVP usually is given by injection or as nasal spray. Because the effect of this medicine wears off if it's used often, the medicine is given only in certain situations. For example, you may take this medicine prior to dental work or before playing certain sports to prevent or reduce bleeding. Antifibrinolytic Medicines Antifibrinolytic medicines (including tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid) may be used with replacement therapy. They're usually given as a pill, and they help keep blood clots from breaking down. These medicines most often are used before dental work or to treat bleeding from the mouth or nose or mild intestinal bleeding. Gene Therapy Researchers are trying to find ways to correct the faulty genes that cause hemophilia. Gene therapy hasn't yet developed to the point that it's an accepted treatment for hemophilia. However, researchers continue to test gene therapy in clinical trials. For more information, go to the \\"Clinical Trials\\" section of this article. Treatment of a Specific Bleeding Site Pain medicines, steroids, and physical therapy may be used to reduce pain and swelling in an affected joint. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take. Which Treatment Is Best for You? The type of treatment you or your child receives depends on several things, including how severe the hemophilia is, the activities you'll be doing, and the dental or medical procedures you'll be having. Mild hemophiliaReplacement therapy usually isn't needed for mild hemophilia. Sometimes, though, DDAVP is given to raise the body's level of factor VIII. Moderate hemophiliaYou may need replacement therapy only when bleeding occurs or to prevent bleeding that could occur when doing certain activities. Your doctor also may recommend DDAVP prior to having a procedure or doing an activity that increases the risk of bleeding. Severe hemophiliaYou usually need replacement therapy to prevent bleeding that could damage your joints, muscles, or other parts of your body. Typically, replacement therapy is given at home two or three times a week. This preventive therapy usually is started in patients at a young age and may need to continue for life. For both types of hemophilia, getting quick treatment for bleeding is important. Quick treatment can limit damage to your body. If you or your child has hemophilia, learn to recognize signs of bleeding. Other family members also should learn to watch for signs of bleeding in a child who has hemophilia. Children sometimes ignore signs of bleeding because they want to avoid the discomfort of treatment."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Pleurisy and Other Pleural Disorders ?","completion":"Pleurisy (PLUR-ih-se) is a condition in which the pleura is inflamed. The pleura is a membrane that consists of two large, thin layers of tissue. One layer wraps around the outside of your lungs. The other layer lines the inside of your chest cavity. Between the layers of tissue is a very thin space called the pleural space. Normally this space is filled with a small amount of fluidabout 4 teaspoons full. The fluid helps the two layers of the pleura glide smoothly past each other as you breathe in and out. Pleurisy occurs if the two layers of the pleura become irritated and inflamed. Instead of gliding smoothly past each other, they rub together every time you breathe in. The rubbing can cause sharp pain. Many conditions can cause pleurisy, including viral infections. Other Pleural Disorders Pneumothorax Air or gas can build up in the pleural space. When this happens, it's called a pneumothorax (noo-mo-THOR-aks). A lung disease or acute lung injury can cause a pneumothorax. Some lung procedures also can cause a pneumothorax. Examples include lung surgery, drainage of fluid with a needle,bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee), andmechanical ventilation. Sometimes the cause of a pneumothorax isn't known. The most common symptoms of a pneumothorax are sudden pain in one side of the lung and shortness of breath. The air or gas in the pleural space also can put pressure on the lung and cause it to collapse. Pleurisy and Pneumothorax A small pneumothorax may go away without treatment. A large pneumothorax may require a procedure to remove air or gas from the pleural space. A very large pneumothorax can interfere with blood flow through your chest and cause your blood pressure to drop. This is called a tension pneumothorax. Pleural Effusion In some cases of pleurisy, excess fluid builds up in the pleural space. This is called a pleural effusion. A lot of extra fluid can push the pleura against your lung until the lung, or part of it, collapses. This can make it hard for you to breathe. Sometimes the extra fluid gets infected and turns into an abscess. When this happens, it's called an empyema (em-pi-E-ma). You can develop a pleural effusion even if you don't have pleurisy. For example,pneumonia, (nu-MO-ne-ah),heart failure, cancer, or pulmonary embolism (PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm) can lead to a pleural effusion. Hemothorax Blood also can build up in the pleural space. This condition is called a hemothorax (he-mo-THOR-aks). An injury to your chest, chest or heart surgery, or lung or pleural cancer can cause a hemothorax. A hemothorax can put pressure on the lung and cause it to collapse. A hemothorax also can cause shock. In shock, not enough blood and oxygen reach your body's vital organs. Outlook Pleurisy and other pleural disorders can be serious, depending on their causes. If the condition that caused the pleurisy or other pleural disorder isn't too serious and is diagnosed and treated early, you usually can expect a full recovery."},{"prompt":"What causes Pleurisy and Other Pleural Disorders ?","completion":"Pleurisy Many conditions can cause pleurisy. Viral infections are likely the most common cause. Other causes of pleurisy include: Bacterial infections, such as pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) and tuberculosis, and infections from fungi or parasites Pulmonary embolism, a blood clot that travels through the blood vessels to the lungs Autoimmune disorders, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis Cancer, such as lung cancer, lymphoma, and mesothelioma (MEZ-o-thee-lee-O-ma) Chest and heart surgery, especially coronary artery bypass grafting Lung diseases, such as LAM (lymphangioleiomyomatosis) or asbestosis (as-bes-TO-sis) Inflammatory bowel disease Familial Mediterranean fever, an inherited condition that often causes fever and swelling in the abdomen or lungs Other causes of pleurisy include chest injuries, pancreatitis (an inflamed pancreas), and reactions to certain medicines. Reactions to certain medicines can cause a condition similar to lupus. These medicines include procainamide, hydralazine, and isoniazid. Sometimes doctors can't find the cause of pleurisy. Pneumothorax Lung diseases or acute lung injury can make it more likely that you will develop a pneumothorax (a buildup of air or gas in the pleural space). Such lung diseases may include COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), tuberculosis, and LAM. Surgery or a chest injury also may cause a pneumothorax. You can develop a pneumothorax without having a recognized lung disease or chest injury. This is called a spontaneous pneumothorax. Smoking increases your risk of spontaneous pneumothorax. Having a family history of the condition also increases your risk. Pleural Effusion The most common cause of a pleural effusion (a buildup of fluid in the pleural space) is heart failure. Lung cancer, LAM, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and other lung infections also can lead to a pleural effusion. Sometimes kidney or liver disease can cause fluid to build up in the pleural space. Asbestosis, sarcoidosis (sar-koy-DO-sis), and reactions to some medicines also can lead to a pleural effusion. Hemothorax An injury to the chest, chest or heart surgery, or lung or pleural cancer can cause a hemothorax (buildup of blood in the pleural space).

They include: Chest pain Shortness of breath Respiratory failure A rapid heart rate Anxiety Restlessness"},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Pleurisy and Other Pleural Disorders ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose pleurisy or another pleural disorder based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor will want to rule out other causes of your symptoms. He or she also will want to find the underlying cause of the pleurisy or other pleural disorder so it can be treated. Medical History Your doctor may ask detailed questions about your medical history. He or she likely will ask you to describe any pain, especially: What it feels like Where it's located and whether you can feel it in your arms, jaw, or shoulders When it started and whether it goes away and then comes back What makes it better or worse Your doctor also may ask whether you have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, coughing, or palpitations. Palpitations are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or fast. Your doctor also may ask whether you've ever: Had heart disease. Smoked. Traveled to places where you may have been exposed to tuberculosis. Had a job that exposed you to asbestos. Asbestos is a mineral that, at one time, was widely used in many industries. Your doctor also may ask about medicines you take or have taken. Reactions to some medicines can cause pleurisy or other pleural disorders. Physical Exam Your doctor will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope to find out whether your lungs are making any abnormal sounds. If you have pleurisy, the inflamed layers of the pleura make a rough, scratchy sound as they rub against each other when you breathe. Doctors call this a pleural friction rub. If your doctor hears the friction rub, he or she will know that you have pleurisy. If you have a pleural effusion, fluid buildup in the pleural space will prevent a friction rub. But if you have a lot of fluid, your doctor may hear a dull sound when he or she taps on your chest. Or, he or she may have trouble hearing any breathing sounds. Muffled or dull breathing sounds also can be a sign of a pneumothorax (a buildup of air or gas in the pleural space). Diagnostic Tests Depending on the results of your physical exam, your doctor may recommend tests. Chest X Ray Achest x rayis a painless test that creates a picture of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test may show air or fluid in the pleural space. A chest x ray also may show what's causing a pleural disorderfor example, pneumonia, a fractured rib, or a lung tumor. Sometimes a chest x ray is taken while you lie on your side. This position can show fluid that didn't appear on an x ray taken while you were standing. Chest CT Scan A chest computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scan, orchest CT scan,is a painless test that creates precise pictures of the structures in your chest. This test provides a computer-generated picture of your lungs that can show pockets of fluid. A chest CT scan also may show signs of pneumonia, a lung abscess, a tumor, or other possible causes of pleural disorders. Ultrasound This test uses sound waves to create pictures of your lungs. An ultrasound may show where fluid is located in your chest. The test also can show some tumors. Chest MRI A chest magnetic resonance imaging scan, orchest MRI,uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to created detailed pictures of the structures in your chest. This test can show pleural effusions and tumors. This test also is called a magnetic resonance (MR) scan or a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) scan. Blood Tests Blood testscan show whether you have an illness that increases your risk of pleurisy or another pleural disorder. Such illnesses include bacterial or viral infections, pneumonia, pancreatitis (an inflamed pancreas), kidney disease, or lupus. Arterial Blood Gas Test For this test, a blood sample is taken from an artery, usually in your wrist. The blood's oxygen and carbon dioxide levels are checked. This test shows how well your lungs are taking in oxygen. Thoracentesis Once your doctor knows whether fluid has built up in the pleural space and where it is, he or she can remove a sample for testing. This is done using a procedure calledthoracentesis(THOR-ah-sen-TE-sis). During the procedure, your doctor inserts a thin needle or plastic tube into the pleural space and draws out the excess fluid. After the fluid is removed from your chest, it's sent for testing. The risks of thoracentesissuch as pain, bleeding, and infectionusually are minor. They get better on their own, or they're easily treated. Your doctor may do a chest x ray after the procedure to check for complications. Fluid Analysis The fluid removed during thoracentesis is examined under a microscope. It's checked for signs of infection, cancer, or other conditions that can cause fluid or blood to build up in the pleural space. Biopsy Your doctor may suspect that tuberculosis or cancer has caused fluid to build up in your pleural space. If so, he or she may want to look at a small piece of the pleura under a microscope. To take a tissue sample, your doctor may do one of the following procedures: Insert a needle into your chest to remove a small sample of the pleura's outer layer. Insert a tube with a light on the end (endoscope) into tiny cuts in your chest wall so that he or she can see the pleura. Your doctor can then snip out small pieces of tissue. This procedure must be done in a hospital. You'll be given medicine to make you sleep during the procedure. Snip out a sample of the pleura through a small cut in your chest wall. This is called an open pleural biopsy. It's usually done if the sample from the needle biopsy is too small for an accurate diagnosis. This procedure must be done in a hospital. You'll be given medicine to make you sleep during the procedure."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Pleurisy and Other Pleural Disorders ?","completion":"Pleurisy and other pleural disorders are treated with procedures, medicines, and other methods. The goals of treatment include: Relieving symptoms Removing the fluid, air, or blood from the pleural space (if a large amount is present) Treating the underlying condition Relieving Symptoms To relieve pleurisy symptoms, your doctor may recommend: Acetaminophen or anti-inflammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen) to control pain. Codeine-based cough syrups to controlcoughing. Lying on your painful side. This might make you more comfortable. Breathing deeply and coughing to clear mucus as the pain eases. Otherwise, you may developpneumonia. Getting plenty of rest. Removing Fluid, Air, or Blood From the Pleural Space Your doctor may recommend removing fluid, air, or blood from your pleural space to prevent a lung collapse. The procedures used to drain fluid, air, or blood from the pleural space are similar. Duringthoracentesis, your doctor will insert a thin needle or plastic tube into the pleural space. An attached syringe will draw fluid out of your chest. This procedure can remove more than 6 cups of fluid at a time. If your doctor needs to remove a lot of fluid, he or she may use a chest tube. Your doctor will inject a painkiller into the area of your chest wall where the fluid is. He or she will then insert a plastic tube into your chest between two ribs. The tube will be connected to a box that suctions out the fluid. Your doctor will use achest x ray to check the tube's position. Your doctor also can use a chest tube to drain blood and air from the pleural space. This process can take several days. The tube will be left in place, and you'll likely stay in the hospital during this time. Sometimes the fluid in the pleural space contains thick pus or blood clots. It may form a hard skin or peel, which makes the fluid harder to drain. To help break up the pus or blood clots, your doctor may use a chest tube to deliver medicines called fibrinolytics to the pleural space. If the fluid still won't drain, you may need surgery. If you have a small, persistent air leak into the pleural space, your doctor may attach a one-way valve to the chest tube. The valve allows air to exit the pleural space, but not reenter. Using this type of valve may allow you to continue your treatment from home. Treat the Underlying Condition The fluid sample that was removed during thoracentesis will be checked under a microscope. This can tell your doctor what's causing the fluid buildup, and he or she can decide the best way to treat it. If the fluid is infected, treatment will involve antibiotics and drainage. If you have tuberculosis or a fungal infection, treatment will involve long-term use of antibiotics or antifungal medicines. If tumors in the pleura are causing fluid buildup, the fluid may quickly build up again after it's drained. Sometimes antitumor medicines will prevent further fluid buildup. If they don't, your doctor may seal the pleural space. Sealing the pleural space is called pleurodesis (plur-OD-eh-sis). For this procedure, your doctor will drain all of the fluid out of your chest through a chest tube. Then he or she will push a substance through the chest tube into the pleural space. The substance will irritate the surface of the pleura. This will cause the two layers of the pleura to stick together, preventing more fluid from building up. Chemotherapy or radiation treatment also may be used to reduce the size of the tumors. Ifheart failureis causing fluid buildup, treatment usually includes diuretics (medicines that help reduce fluid buildup) and other medicines."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis ?","completion":"Thrombocythemia (THROM-bo-si-THE-me-ah) and thrombocytosis (THROM-bo-si-TO-sis) are conditions in which your blood has a higher than normal number of platelets (PLATE-lets). Platelets are blood cell fragments. They're made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells. Platelets travel through your blood vessels and stick together (clot). Clotting helps stop any bleeding that may occur if a blood vessel is damaged. Platelets also are called thrombocytes (THROM-bo-sites) because a blood clot also is called a thrombus. A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. Overview The term \\"thrombocythemia\\" is preferred when the cause of a high platelet count isn't known. The condition sometimes is called primary or essential thrombocythemia. This condition occurs if faulty cells in the bone marrow make too many platelets. Bone marrow is the sponge-like tissue inside the bones. It contains stem cells that develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. What causes the bone marrow to make too many platelets often isn't known. With primary thrombocythemia, a high platelet count may occur alone or with other blood cell disorders. This condition isn't common. When another disease or condition causes a high platelet count, the term \\"thrombocytosis\\" is preferred. This condition often is called secondary or reactive thrombocytosis. Secondary thrombocytosis is more common than primary thrombocythemia. Often, a high platelet count doesn't cause signs or symptoms. Rarely, serious or life-threatening symptoms can develop, such as blood clots and bleeding. These symptoms are more likely to occur in people who have primary thrombocythemia. Outlook People who have primary thrombocythemia with no signs or symptoms don't need treatment, as long as the condition remains stable. Other people who have this condition may need medicines or procedures to treat it. Most people who have primary thrombocythemia will live a normal lifespan. Treatment and outlook for secondary thrombocytosis depend on its underlying cause."},{"prompt":"What causes Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis ?","completion":"Primary Thrombocythemia In this condition, faulty stem cells in the bone marrow make too many platelets. What causes this to happen usually isn't known. When this process occurs without other blood cell disorders, it's called essential thrombocythemia. A rare form of thrombocythemia is inherited. (\\"Inherited\\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through the genes.) In some cases, a genetic mutation may cause the condition. In addition to the bone marrow making too many platelets, the platelets also are abnormal in primary thrombocythemia. They may form blood clots or, surprisingly, cause bleeding when they don't work well. Bleeding also can occur because of a condition that develops called von Willebrand disease. This condition affects the blood clotting process. After many years, scarring of the bone marrow can occur. Secondary Thrombocytosis This condition occurs if another disease, condition, or outside factor causes the platelet count to rise. For example, 35 percent of people who have high platelet counts also have cancermostly lung, gastrointestinal, breast, ovarian, and lymphoma. Sometimes a high platelet count is the first sign of cancer. Other conditions or factors that can cause a high platelet count are: Iron-deficiency anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh) Hemolytic (HEE-moh-lit-ick) anemia Absence of a spleen (after surgery to remove the organ) Inflammatory or infectious diseases, such as connective tissue disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, and tuberculosis Reactions to medicine Some conditions can lead to a high platelet count that lasts for only a short time. Examples of such conditions include: Recovery from serious blood loss Recovery from a very low platelet count caused by excessive alcohol use and lack of vitamin B12 or folate Acute (short-term) infection or inflammation Response to physical activity Although the platelet count is high in secondary thrombocytosis, the platelets are normal (unlike in primary thrombocythemia). Thus, people who have secondary thrombocytosis have a lower risk of blood clots and bleeding."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis? ?","completion":"Primary Thrombocythemia Thrombocythemia isn't common. The exact number of people who have the condition isn't known. Some estimates suggest that 24 out of every 100,000 people have primary thrombocythemia. Primary thrombocythemia is more common in people aged 50 to 70, but it can occur at any age. For unknown reasons, more women around the age of 30 have primary thrombocythemia than men of the same age. Secondary Thrombocytosis You might be at risk for secondary thrombocytosis if you have a disease, condition, or factor that can cause it. (For more information, go to \\"What Causes Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis?\\") Secondary thrombocytosis is more common than primary thrombocythemia. Studies have shown that most people who have platelet counts over 500,000 have secondary thrombocytosis."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis ?","completion":"People who have thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis may not have signs or symptoms. These conditions might be discovered only after routine blood tests. However, people who have primary thrombocythemia are more likely than those who have secondary thrombocytosis to have serious signs and symptoms. The signs and symptoms of a high platelet count are linked to blood clots and bleeding. They include weakness, bleeding, headache, dizziness, chest pain, and tingling in the hands and feet. Blood Clots In primary thrombocythemia, blood clots most often develop in the brain, hands, and feet. But they can develop anywhere in the body, including in the heart and intestines. Blood clots in the brain may cause symptoms such as chronic (ongoing) headache and dizziness. In extreme cases, stroke may occur. Blood clots in the tiny blood vessels of the hands and feet leave them numb and red. This may lead to an intense burning and throbbing pain felt mainly on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Other signs and symptoms of blood clots may include: Changes in speech or awareness, ranging from confusion to passing out Seizures Upper body discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or abdomen Shortness of breath and nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) In pregnant women, blood clots in the placenta can cause miscarriage or problems with fetal growth and development. Women who have primary thrombocythemia or secondary thrombocytosis and take birth control pills are at increased risk for blood clots. Blood clots are related to other conditions and factors as well. Older age, prior blood clots, diabetes, high blood pressure, and smoking also increase your risk for blood clots. Bleeding If bleeding occurs, it most often affects people who have platelet counts higher than 1million platelets per microliter of blood. Signs of bleeding include nosebleeds, bruising, bleeding from the mouth or gums, or blood in the stools. Although bleeding usually is associated with a low platelet count, it also can occur in people who have high platelet counts. Blood clots that develop in thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis may use up your body's platelets. This means that not enough platelets are left in your bloodstream to seal off cuts or breaks on the blood vessel walls. Another cause of bleeding in people who have very high platelets counts is a condition called von Willebrand Disease. This condition affects the blood clotting process. In rare cases of primary thrombocythemia, the faulty bone marrow cells will cause a form of leukemia (lu-KE-me-ah). Leukemia is a cancer of the blood cells."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. A hematologist also may be involved in your care. This is a doctor who specializes in blood diseases and conditions. Medical History Your doctor may ask you about factors that can affect your platelets, such as: Any medical procedures or blood transfusions you've had Any recent infections or vaccines you've had The medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines Your general eating habits, including the amount of alcohol you normally drink Any family history of high platelet counts Physical Exam Your doctor will do a physical exam to look for signs and symptoms of blood clots and bleeding. He or she also will check for signs of conditions that can cause secondary thrombocytosis, such as an infection. Primary thrombocythemia is diagnosed only after all possible causes of a high platelet count are ruled out. For example, your doctor may recommend tests to check for early, undiagnosed cancer. If another disease, condition, or factor is causing a high platelet count, the diagnosis is secondary thrombocytosis. Diagnostic Tests Your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to help diagnose a high platelet count. Complete Blood Count A complete blood count (CBC) measures the levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm. If you have thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis, the CBC results will show that your platelet count is high. Blood Smear A blood smear is used to check the condition of your platelets. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm. Some of your blood is put on a glass slide. A microscope is then used to look at your platelets. Bone Marrow Tests Bone marrow tests check whether your bone marrow is healthy. Blood cells, including platelets, are made in the bone marrow. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pih-RA-shun) and biopsy. Bone marrow aspiration might be done to find out whether your bone marrow is making too many platelets. For this test, your doctor removes a sample of fluid bone marrow through a needle. He or she examines the sample under a microscope to check for faulty cells. A bone marrow biopsy often is done right after an aspiration. For this test, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a needle. He or she examines the tissue to check the number and types of cells in the bone marrow. With thrombocythemia and thrombocytosis, the bone marrow has a higher than normal number of the very large cells that make platelets. Other Tests Your doctor may recommend other blood tests to look for genetic factors that can cause a high platelet count."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis ?","completion":"Primary Thrombocythemia This condition is considered less harmful today than in the past, and its outlook often is good. People who have no signs or symptoms don't need treatment, as long as the condition remains stable. Taking aspirin may help people who are at risk for blood clots (aspirin thins the blood). However, talk with your doctor about using aspirin because it can cause bleeding. Doctors prescribe aspirin to most pregnant women who have primary thrombocythemia. This is because it doesn't have a high risk of side effects for the fetus. Some people who have primary thrombocythemia may need medicines or medical procedures to lower their platelet counts. Medicines To Lower Platelet Counts You may need medicines to lower your platelet count if you: Have a history of blood clots or bleeding Have risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes Are older than 60 Have a platelet count over 1 million You'll need to take these medicines throughout your life. Hydroxyurea. This platelet-lowering medicine is used to treat cancers and other life-threatening diseases. Hydroxyurea most often is given under the care of doctors who specialize in cancer or blood diseases. Patients on hydroxyurea are closely monitored. Currently, hydroxyurea plus aspirin is the standard treatment for people who have primary thrombocythemia and are at high risk for blood clots. Anagrelide. This medicine also has been used to lower platelet counts in people who have thrombocythemia. However, research shows that when compared with hydroxyurea, anagrelide has worse outcomes. Anagrelide also has side effects, such as fluid retention, palpitations (pal-pih-TA-shuns), arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), heart failure, and headaches. Interferon alfa. This medicine lowers platelet counts, but 20 percent of patients can't handle its side effects. Side effects include a flu-like feeling, decreased appetite, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), diarrhea, seizures, irritability, and sleepiness. Doctors may prescribe this medicine to pregnant women who have primary thrombocythemia because it's safer for a fetus than hydroxyurea and anagrelide. Plateletpheresis Plateletpheresis (PLATE-let-fe-REH-sis) is a procedure used to rapidly lower your platelet count. This procedure is used only for emergencies. For example, if you're having a stroke due to primary thrombocythemia, you may need plateletpheresis. An intravenous (IV) needle that's connected to a tube is placed in one of your blood vessels to remove blood. The blood goes through a machine that removes platelets from the blood. The remaining blood is then put back into you through an IV line in one of your blood vessels. One or two procedures might be enough to reduce your platelet count to a safe level. Secondary Thrombocytosis Secondary thrombocytosis is treated by addressing the condition that's causing it. People who have secondary thrombocytosis usually don't need platelet-lowering medicines or procedures. This is because their platelets usually are normal (unlike in primary thrombocythemia). Also, secondary thrombocytosis is less likely than primary thrombocythemia to cause serious problems related to blood clots and bleeding."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis ?","completion":"You can't prevent primary thrombocythemia. However, you can take steps to reduce your risk for complications. For example, you can control many of the risk factors for blood clots, such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking. To reduce your risk, quit smoking, adopt healthy lifestyle habits, and work with your doctor to manage your risk factors. It's not always possible to prevent conditions that lead to secondary thrombocytosis. But, if you have routine medical care, your doctor may detect these conditions before you develop a high platelet count."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Hemochromatosis ?","completion":"Hemochromatosis (HE-mo-kro-ma-TO-sis) is a disease in which too much iron builds up in your body (iron overload). Iron is a mineral found in many foods. Too much iron is toxic to your body. It can poison your organs and cause organ failure. In hemochromatosis, iron can build up in most of your body's organs, but especially in the liver, heart, and pancreas. Too much iron in the liver can cause an enlarged liver, liver failure, liver cancer, or cirrhosis (sir-RO-sis). Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver, which causes the organ to not work well. Too much iron in the heart can cause irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs) and heart failure. Too much iron in the pancreas can lead to diabetes. If hemochromatosis isn't treated, it may even cause death. Overview The two types of hemochromatosis are primary and secondary. Primary hemochromatosis is caused by a defect in the genes that control how much iron you absorb from food. Secondary hemochromatosis usually is the result of another disease or condition that causes iron overload. Most people who have primary hemochromatosis inherit it from their parents. If you inherit two hemochromatosis genesone from each parentyou're at risk for iron overload and signs and symptoms of the disease. The two faulty genes cause your body to absorb more iron than usual from the foods you eat. Hemochromatosis is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States. However, not everyone who has hemochromatosis has signs or symptoms of the disease. Estimates of how many people develop signs and symptoms vary greatly. Some estimates suggest that as many as half of all people who have the disease don't have signs or symptoms. The severity of hemochromatosis also varies. Some people don't have complications, even with high levels of iron in their bodies. Others have severe complications or die from the disease. Certain factors can affect the severity of the disease. For example, a high intake of vitamin C can make hemochromatosis worse. This is because vitamin C helps your body absorb iron from food. Alcohol use can worsen liver damage and cirrhosis caused by hemochromatosis. Conditions such as hepatitis also can further damage or weaken the liver. Outlook The outlook for people who have hemochromatosis largely depends on how much organ damage they have at the time of diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment of the disease are important. Treatment may help prevent, delay, or sometimes reverse complications of the disease. Treatment also may lead to better quality of life. For people who are diagnosed and treated early, a normal lifespan is possible. If left untreated, hemochromatosis can lead to severe organ damage and even death."},{"prompt":"What causes Hemochromatosis ?","completion":"The two types of hemochromatosis are primary and secondary. Each type has a different cause. Primary Hemochromatosis Primary hemochromatosis is caused by a defect in the genes that control how much iron you absorb from food. This form of the disease sometimes is called hereditary or classical hemochromatosis. Primary hemochromatosis is more common than the secondary form of the disease. The genes usually involved in primary hemochromatosis are called HFE genes. Faulty HFE genes cause the body to absorb too much iron. If you inherit two copies of the faulty HFE gene (one from each parent), you're at risk for iron overload and signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis. If you inherit one faulty HFE gene and one normal HFE gene, you're a hemochromatosis \\"carrier.\\" Carriers usually don't develop the disease. However, they can pass the faulty gene on to their children. Estimates suggest that about 1 in 10 people in the United States are hemochromatosis carriers. If two parents are carriers of the faulty HFE gene, then each of their children has a 1 in 4 chance of inheriting two faulty HFE genes. Although less common, other faulty genes also can cause hemochromatosis. Researchers continue to study what changes to normal genes may cause the disease. Secondary Hemochromatosis Secondary hemochromatosis usually is the result of another disease or condition that causes iron overload. Examples of such diseases and conditions include: Certain types of anemia, such as thalassemias and sideroblastic anemia Atransferrinemia and aceruloplasminemiaboth are rare, inherited diseases Chronic liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis C infection, alcoholic liver disease, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis Other factors also can cause secondary hemochromatosis, including: Blood transfusions Oral iron pills or iron injections, with or without very high vitamin C intake (vitamin C helps your body absorb iron) Long-term kidney dialysis"},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Hemochromatosis? ?","completion":"Hemochromatosis is one of the most common genetic diseases in the United States. It's most common in Caucasians of Northern European descent. The disease is less common in African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians. Primary hemochromatosis is more common in men than in women. Also, older people are more likely to develop the disease than younger people. In fact, signs and symptoms usually don't occur in men until they're 40 to 60 years old. In women, signs and symptoms usually don't occur until after the age of 50 (after menopause). Young children rarely develop hemochromatosis. Inheriting two faulty HFE genes (one from each parent) is the major risk factor for hemochromatosis. However, many people who have two copies of the faulty gene don't develop signs or symptoms of the disease. Alcoholism is another risk factor for hemochromatosis.

Examples of such diseases and conditions include heart attack, liver disease, diabetes, arthritis, and erectile dysfunction (impotence)."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Hemochromatosis ?","completion":"Hemochromatosis can affect many parts of the body and cause various signs and symptoms. Many of the signs and symptoms are similar to those of other diseases. Signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis usually don't occur until middle age. Women are more likely to have general symptoms first, such as fatigue (tiredness). In men, complications such as diabetes or cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) often are the first signs of the disease. Signs and symptoms also vary based on the severity of the disease.

The disease sometimes is detected while checking for other diseases or conditions, such as arthritis, liver disease, diabetes, heart disease, or erectile dysfunction (impotence). Specialists Involved Family doctors and internal medicine specialists may diagnose and treat hemochromatosis. Other doctors also may be involved in diagnosing and treating the disease, including: Hematologists (blood disease specialists) Cardiologists (heart specialists) Endocrinologists (gland system specialists) Hepatologists (liver specialists) Gastroenterologists (digestive tract specialists) Rheumatologists (specialists in diseases of the joints and tissues) Medical and Family Histories To learn about your medical and family histories, your doctor may ask: About your signs and symptoms, including when they started and their severity. Whether you take iron (pills or injections) with or without vitamin C supplements (vitamin C helps your body absorb iron from food). If so, your doctor may ask how much iron you take. This information can help him or her diagnose secondary hemochromatosis. Whether other members of your family have hemochromatosis. Whether other members of your family have a history of medical problems or diseases related to hemochromatosis. Physical Exam Your doctor will do a physical exam to check for signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis. He or she will listen to your heart for irregular heartbeats and check for arthritis, abnormal skin color, and an enlarged liver. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures Your doctor may recommend one or more tests or procedures to diagnose hemochromatosis. Blood Tests In hemochromatosis, the amount of iron in your body may be too high, even though the level of iron in your blood is normal. Certain blood tests can help your doctor find out how much iron is in your body. During these tests, a sample of blood is taken from your body. It's usually drawn from a vein in your arm using a needle. The procedure usually is quick and easy, although it may cause some short-term discomfort. The blood tests you have may include transferrin saturation (TS), serum ferritin level, and liver function tests. Transferrin is a protein that carries iron in the blood. The TS test shows how much iron the transferrin is carrying. This helps your doctor find out how much iron is in your body. Your doctor may test your serum ferritin level if your TS level is high. A serum ferritin level test shows how much iron is stored in your body's organs. A buildup of iron may suggest hemochromatosis. You may have liver function tests to check for damage to your liver. Liver damage may be a sign of hemochromatosis. If you have hemochromatosis, liver function tests may show the severity of the disease. Blood tests alone can't diagnose hemochromatosis. Thus, your doctor may recommend other tests as well. Liver Biopsy During a liver biopsy, your doctor numbs an area near your liver and then removes a small sample of liver tissue using a needle. The tissue is then looked at under a microscope. A liver biopsy can show how much iron is in your liver. This procedure also can help your doctor diagnose liver damage (for example, scarring and cancer). Liver biopsies are less common now than in the past. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a safe test that uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create pictures of your organs. An MRI may be done to show the amount of iron in your liver. Superconducting Quantum Interference Device A superconducting quantum interference device (SQuID) is a machine that uses very sensitive magnets to measure the amount of iron in your liver. This machine is available at only a few medical centers. Genetic Testing Genetic testing can show whether you have a faulty HFE gene or genes. However, even if you do have two faulty HFE genes, the genetic test can't predict whether you'll develop signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis. Also, genetic testing may not detect other, less common faulty genes that also can cause hemochromatosis. There are two ways to do genetic testing. Cells can be collected from inside your mouth using a cotton swab, or a sample of blood can be drawn from a vein in your arm. People who have hemochromatosis (or a family history of it) and are planning to have children may want to consider genetic testing and counseling. Testing will help show whether one or both parents have faulty HFE genes. A genetic counselor also can help figure out the likelihood of the parents passing the faulty genes on to their children."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Hemochromatosis ?","completion":"Treatments for hemochromatosis include therapeutic phlebotomy (fleh-BOT-o-me), iron chelation (ke-LAY-shun) therapy, dietary changes, and treatment for complications. The goals of treating hemochromatosis include: Reducing the amount of iron in your body to normal levels Preventing or delaying organ damage from iron overload Treating complications of the disease Maintaining a normal amount of iron in your body for the rest of your life Therapeutic Phlebotomy Therapeutic phlebotomy is a procedure that removes blood (and iron) from your body. A needle is inserted into a vein, and your blood flows through an airtight tube into a sterile container or bag. The process is similar to donating blood; it can be done at blood donation centers, hospital donation centers, or a doctor's office. In the first stage of treatment, about 1 pint of blood is removed once or twice a week. After your iron levels return to normal, you may continue phlebotomy treatments. However, you may need them less oftentypically every 24 months. As long as treatment continues, which often is for the rest of your life, you'll need frequent blood tests to check your iron levels. Iron Chelation Therapy Iron chelation therapy uses medicine to remove excess iron from your body. This treatment is a good option for people who can't have routine blood removal. The medicine used in iron chelation therapy is either injected or taken orally (by mouth). Injected iron chelation therapy is done at a doctor's office. Oral iron chelation therapy can be done at home. Dietary Changes Your doctor may suggest that you change your diet if you have hemochromatosis. You may be advised to: Avoid taking iron, including iron pills, iron injections, or multivitamins that contain iron. Limit your intake of vitamin C. Vitamin C helps your body absorb iron from food. Talk with your doctor about how much vitamin C is safe for you. Avoid uncooked fish and shellfish. Some fish and shellfish contain bacteria that can cause infections in people who have chronic diseases, such as hemochromatosis. Limit alcohol intake. Drinking alcohol increases the risk of liver disease. It also can make existing liver disease worse.

Coughing helps clear your airways of lung irritants, such as smoke and mucus (a slimy substance). This helps prevent infections. A cough also can be a symptom of a medical problem. Prolonged coughing can cause unpleasant side effects, such as chest pain, exhaustion, light-headedness, and loss of bladder control. Coughing also can interfere with sleep, socializing, and work. Overview Coughing occurs when the nerve endings in your airways become irritated. The airways are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs. Certain substances (such as smoke and pollen), medical conditions, and medicines can irritate these nerve endings. A cough can be acute, subacute, or chronic, depending on how long it lasts. An acute cough lasts less than 3 weeks. Common causes of an acute cough are a common cold or other upper respiratory (RES-pi-rah-tor-e) infections. Examples of other upper respiratory infections include the flu, pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah), and whooping cough. A subacute cough lasts 3 to 8 weeks. This type of cough remains even after a cold or other respiratory infection is over. A chronic cough lasts more than 8 weeks. Common causes of a chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome (UACS); asthma; and gastroesophageal (GAS-tro-eh-so-fa-JE-al) reflux disease, or GERD. \\"UACS\\" is a term used to describe conditions that inflame the upper airways and cause a cough. Examples include sinus infections and allergies. These conditions can cause mucus to run down your throat from the back of your nose. This is called postnasal drip. Asthma is a long-term lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. GERD occurs if acid from your stomach backs up into your throat. Outlook The best way to treat a cough is to treat its cause. For example, asthma is treated with medicines that open the airways. Your doctor may recommend cough medicine if the cause of your cough is unknown and the cough causes a lot of discomfort. Cough medicines may harm children. If your child has a cough, talk with his or her doctor about how to treat it."},{"prompt":"What causes Cough ?","completion":"Coughing occurs when the nerve endings in your airways become irritated. Certain irritants and allergens, medical conditions, and medicines can irritate these nerve endings. Irritants and Allergens An irritant is something you're sensitive to. For example, smoking or inhaling secondhand smoke can irritate your lungs. Smoking also can lead to medical conditions that can cause a cough. Other irritants include air pollution, paint fumes, or scented products like perfumes or air fresheners. An allergen is something you're allergic to, such as dust, animal dander, mold, or pollens from trees, grasses, and flowers. Coughing helps clear your airways of irritants and allergens. This helps prevent infections. Medical Conditions Many medical conditions can cause acute, subacute, or chronic cough. Common causes of an acute cough are a common cold or other upper respiratory infections. Examples of other upper respiratory infections include the flu, pneumonia, and whooping cough. An acute cough lasts less than 3 weeks. A lingering cough that remains after a cold or other respiratory infection is gone often is called a subacute cough. A subacute cough lasts 3 to 8 weeks. Common causes of a chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). A chronic cough lasts more than 8 weeks. \\"UACS\\" is a term used to describe conditions that inflame the upper airways and cause a cough. Examples include sinus infections and allergies. These conditions can cause mucus (a slimy substance) to run down your throat from the back of your nose. This is called postnasal drip. Asthma is a long-term lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. GERD is a condition in which acid from your stomach backs up into your throat. Other conditions that can cause a chronic cough include: Respiratory infections. A cough from an upper respiratory infection can develop into a chronic cough. Chronic bronchitis (bron-KI-tis). This condition occurs if the lining of the airways is constantly irritated and inflamed. Smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis. Bronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-tah-sis). This is a condition in which damage to the airways causes them to widen and become flabby and scarred. This prevents the airways from properly moving mucus out of your lungs. An infection or other condition that injures the walls of the airways usually causes bronchiectasis. COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is a disease that prevents enough air from flowing in and out of the airways. Lung cancer. In rare cases, a chronic cough is due to lung cancer. Most people who develop lung cancer smoke or used to smoke. Heart failure. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Fluid can build up in the body and lead to many symptoms. If fluid builds up in the lungs, it can cause a chronic cough. Medicines Certain medicines can cause a chronic cough. Examples of these medicines are ACE inhibitors and beta blockers. ACE inhibitors are used to treat high blood pressure (HBP). Beta blockers are used to treat HBP, migraine headaches, and glaucoma."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Cough? ?","completion":"People at risk for cough include those who: Are exposed to things that irritate their airways (called irritants) or things that they're allergic to (called allergens).

Have certain conditions that irritate the lungs, such as asthma, sinus infections, colds, or gastroesophageal reflux disease. Smoke. Smoking can irritate your lungs and cause coughing. Smoking and/or exposure to secondhand smoke also can lead to medical conditions that can cause a cough. Take certain medicines, such as ACE inhibitors and beta blockers. ACE inhibitors are used to treat high blood pressure (HBP). Beta blockers are used to treat HBP, migraine headaches, and glaucoma. Women are more likely than men to develop a chronic cough.

Coughing helps clear the mucus in your airways from a cold, bronchitis, or other condition. Rarely, people cough up blood. If this happens, you should call your doctor right away. A cough may be a symptom of a medical condition. Thus, it may occur with other signs and symptoms of that condition. For example, if you have a cold, you may have a runny or stuffy nose. If you have gastroesophageal reflux disease, you may have a sour taste in your mouth. A chronic cough can make you feel tired because you use a lot of energy to cough. It also can prevent you from sleeping well and interfere with work and socializing. A chronic cough also can cause headaches, chest pain, loss of bladder control, sweating, and, rarely, fractured ribs."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Cough ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose the cause of your cough based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Medical History Your doctor will likely ask questions about your cough. He or she may ask how long you've had it, whether you're coughing anything up (such as mucus, a slimy substance), and how much you cough. Your doctor also may ask: About your medical history, including whether you have allergies, asthma, or other medical conditions. Whether you have heartburn or a sour taste in your mouth. These may be signs of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Whether you've recently had a cold or the flu. Whether you smoke or spend time around others who smoke. Whether you've been around air pollution, a lot of dust, or fumes. Physical Exam To check for signs of problems related to cough, your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs. He or she will listen for wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe) or other abnormal sounds. Diagnostic Tests Your doctor may recommend tests based on the results of your medical history and physical exam. For example, if you have symptoms of GERD, your doctor may recommend a pH probe. This test measures the acid level of the fluid in your throat. Other tests may include: An exam of the mucus from your nose or throat. This test can show whether you have a bacterial infection. A chest x ray. A chest x ray takes a picture of your heart and lungs. This test can help diagnose conditions such as pneumonia and lung cancer. Lung function tests. These tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. Lung function tests can help diagnose asthma and other conditions. An x ray of the sinuses. This test can help diagnose a sinus infection."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Cough ?","completion":"The best way to treat a cough is to treat its cause. However, sometimes the cause is unknown. Other treatments, such as medicines and a vaporizer, can help relieve the cough itself. Treating the Cause of a Cough Acute and Subacute Cough An acute cough lasts less than 3 weeks. Common causes of an acute cough are a common cold or other upper respiratory infections. Examples of other upper respiratory infections include the flu, pneumonia, and whooping cough. An acute cough usually goes away after the illness that caused it is over. A subacute cough lasts 3 to 8 weeks. This type of cough remains even after a cold or other respiratory infection is over. Studies show that antibiotics and cold medicines can't cure a cold. However, your doctor may prescribe medicines to treat another cause of an acute or subacute cough. For example, antibiotics may be given for pneumonia. Chronic Cough A chronic cough lasts more than 8 weeks. Common causes of a chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). \\"UACS\\" is a term used to describe conditions that inflame the upper airways and cause a cough. Examples include sinus infections and allergies. These conditions can cause mucus (a slimy substance) to run down your throat from the back of your nose. This is called postnasal drip. If you have a sinus infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. He or she also may suggest you use a medicine that you spray into your nose. If allergies are causing your cough, your doctor may advise you to avoid the substances that you're allergic to (allergens) if possible. If you have asthma, try to avoid irritants and allergens that make your asthma worse. Take your asthma medicines as your doctor prescribes. GERD occurs if acid from your stomach backs up into your throat. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to reduce acid in your stomach. You also may be able to relieve GERD symptoms by waiting 3 to 4 hours after a meal before lying down, and by sleeping with your head raised. Smoking also can cause a chronic cough. If you smoke, it's important to quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. Many hospitals have programs that help people quit smoking, or hospital staff can refer you to a program. The Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \\"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart\\" booklet have more information about how to quit smoking. Other causes of a chronic cough include respiratory infections, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and heart failure. Treatments for these causes may include medicines, procedures, and other therapies. Treatment also may include avoiding irritants and allergens and quitting smoking. If your chronic cough is due to a medicine you're taking, your doctor may prescribe a different medicine. Treating the Cough Rather Than the Cause Coughing is important because it helps clear your airways of irritants, such as smoke and mucus (a slimy substance). Coughing also helps prevent infections. Cough medicines usually are used only when the cause of the cough is unknown and the cough causes a lot of discomfort. Medicines can help control a cough and make it easier to cough up mucus. Your doctor may recommend medicines such as: Prescription cough suppressants, also called antitussives. These medicines can help relieve a cough. However, they're usually used when nothing else works. No evidence shows that over-the-counter cough suppressants relieve a cough. Expectorants. These medicines may loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up. Bronchodilators. These medicines relax your airways. Other treatments also may relieve an irritated throat and loosen mucus. Examples include using a cool-mist humidifier or steam vaporizer and drinking enough fluids. Examples of fluids are water, soup, and juice. Ask your doctor how much fluid you need. Cough in Children No evidence shows that cough and cold medicines help children recover more quickly from colds. These medicines can even harm children. Talk with your child's doctor about your child's cough and how to treat it."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Pulmonary Embolism ?","completion":"Pulmonary embolism (PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm), or PE, is a sudden blockage in a lung artery. The blockage usually is caused by a blood clot that travels to the lung from a vein in the leg. A clot that forms in one part of the body and travels in the bloodstream to another part of the body is called an embolus (EM-bo-lus). PE is a serious condition that can: Damage part of your lung because of a lack of blood flow to your lung tissue. This damage may lead to pulmonary hypertension (increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries). Cause low oxygen levels in your blood. Damage other organs in your body because of a lack of oxygen. If a blood clot is large, or if there are many clots, PE can cause death. Overview PE most often is a complication of a condition called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In DVT, blood clots form in the deep veins of the bodymost often in the legs. These clots can break free, travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, and block an artery. Deep vein clots are not like clots in veins close to the skin's surface. Those clots remain in place and do not cause PE. Outlook The exact number of people affected by DVT and PE isn't known. Estimates suggest these conditions affect 300,000 to 600,000 people in the United States each year. If left untreated, about 30 percent of patients who have PE will die. Most of those who die do so within the first few hours of the event. The good news is that a prompt diagnosis and proper treatment can save lives and help prevent the complications of PE."},{"prompt":"What causes Pulmonary Embolism ?","completion":"Major Causes Pulmonary embolism (PE) usually begins as a blood clot in a deep vein of the leg. This condition is called deep vein thrombosis. The clot can break free, travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, and block an artery.

Written and spoken explanations are provided with each frame. Use the buttons in the lower right corner to pause, restart, or replay the animation, or use the scroll bar below the buttons to move through the frames. Blood clots can form in the deep veins of the legs if blood flow is restricted and slows down. This can happen if you don't move around for long periods, such as: After some types of surgery During a long trip in a car or airplane If you must stay in bed for an extended time Blood clots are more likely to develop in veins damaged from surgery or injured in other ways. Other Causes Rarely, an air bubble, part of a tumor, or other tissue travels to the lungs and causes PE. Also, if a large bone in the body (such as the thigh bone) breaks, fat from the bone marrow can travel through the blood. If the fat reaches the lungs, it can cause PE"},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Pulmonary Embolism? ?","completion":"Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs equally in men and women. The risk increases with age. For every 10 years after age 60, the risk of having PE doubles. Certain inherited conditions, such as factor V Leiden, increase the risk of blood clotting and PE. Major Risk Factors Your risk for PE is high if you have deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a history of DVT. In DVT, blood clots form in the deep veins of the bodymost often in the legs. These clots can break free, travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, and block an artery. Your risk for PE also is high if you've had the condition before. Other Risk Factors Other factors also can increase the risk for PE, such as: Being bedridden or unable to move around much Having surgery or breaking a bone (the risk goes up in the weeks following the surgery or injury) Having certain diseases or conditions, such as a stroke, paralysis (an inability to move), chronic heart disease, or high blood pressure Smoking People who have recently been treated for cancer or who have a central venous catheter are more likely to develop DVT, which increases their risk for PE. A central venous catheter is a tube placed in a vein to allow easy access to the bloodstream for medical treatment. Other risk factors for DVT include sitting for long periods (such as during long car or airplane rides), pregnancy and the 6-week period after pregnancy, and being overweight or obese. Women who take hormone therapy pills or birth control pills also are at increased risk for DVT. The risk of developing blood clots increases as your number of risk factors increases."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Pulmonary Embolism ?","completion":"Major Signs and Symptoms Signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism (PE) include unexplained shortness of breath, problems breathing, chest pain, coughing, or coughing up blood. An arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) also may suggest that you have PE. Sometimes the only signs and symptoms are related to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). These include swelling of the leg or along a vein in the leg, pain or tenderness in the leg, a feeling of increased warmth in the area of the leg that's swollen or tender, and red or discolored skin on the affected leg. See your doctor right away if you have any signs or symptoms of PE or DVT. It's also possible to have PE and not have any signs or symptoms. Other Signs and Symptoms Some people who have PE have feelings of anxiety or dread, light-headedness or fainting, rapid breathing, sweating, or an increased heart rate."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Pulmonary Embolism ?","completion":"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is diagnosed based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Doctors who treat patients in the emergency room often are the ones to diagnose PE with the help of a radiologist. A radiologist is a doctor who deals with x rays and other similar tests. Medical History and Physical Exam To diagnose PE, the doctor will ask about your medical history. He or she will want to: Find out your deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE risk factors See how likely it is that you could have PE Rule out other possible causes for your symptoms Your doctor also will do a physical exam. During the exam, he or she will check your legs for signs of DVT. He or she also will check your blood pressure and your heart and lungs. Diagnostic Tests Many tests can help diagnose PE. Which tests you have will depend on how you feel when you get to the hospital, your risk factors, available testing options, and other conditions you could possibly have. You may have one or more of the following tests. Ultrasound Doctors can use ultrasound to look for blood clots in your legs. Ultrasound uses sound waves to check blood flow in your veins. For this test, gel is put on the skin of your legs. A hand-held device called a transducer is moved back and forth over the affected areas. The transducer gives off ultrasound waves and detects their echoes as they bounce off the vein walls and blood cells. A computer turns the echoes into a picture on a computer screen, allowing the doctor to see blood flow in your legs. If the doctor finds blood clots in the deep veins of your legs, he or she will recommend treatment. DVT and PE both are treated with the same medicines. Computed Tomography Scans Doctors can use computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scans, or CT scans, to look for blood clots in the lungs and legs. For this test, dye is injected into a vein in your arm. The dye makes the blood vessels in your lungs and legs show up on x-ray images. You'll lie on a table, and an x-ray tube will rotate around you. The tube will take pictures from many angles. This test allows doctors to detect most cases of PE. The test only takes a few minutes. Results are available shortly after the scan is done. Lung Ventilation/Perfusion Scan A lung ventilation/perfusion scan, or VQ scan, uses a radioactive substance to show how well oxygen and blood are flowing to all areas of your lungs. This test can help detect PE. Pulmonary Angiography Pulmonary angiography (an-jee-OG-rah-fee) is another test used to diagnose PE. This test isn't available at all hospitals, and a trained specialist must do the test. For this test, a flexible tube called a catheter is threaded through the groin (upper thigh) or arm to the blood vessels in the lungs. Dye is injected into the blood vessels through the catheter. X-ray pictures are taken to show blood flowing through the blood vessels in the lungs. If a blood clot is found, your doctor may use the catheter to remove it or deliver medicine to dissolve it. Blood Tests Certain blood tests may help your doctor find out whether you're likely to have PE. A D-dimer test measures a substance in the blood that's released when a blood clot breaks down. High levels of the substance may mean a clot is present. If your test is normal and you have few risk factors, PE isn't likely. Other blood tests check for inherited disorders that cause blood clots. Blood tests also can measure the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood. A clot in a blood vessel in your lungs may lower the level of oxygen in your blood. Other Tests To rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, your doctor may use one or more of the following tests. Echocardiography (echo). This test uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. Doctors use echo to check heart function and detect blood clots inside the heart. EKG (electrocardiogram). An EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. Chest x ray. This test creates pictures of your lungs, heart, large arteries, ribs, and diaphragm (the muscle below your lungs). Chest MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This test uses radio waves and magnetic fields to create pictures of organs and structures inside the body. MRI often can provide more information than an x ray."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Pulmonary Embolism ?","completion":"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is treated with medicines, procedures, and other therapies. The main goals of treating PE are to stop the blood clot from getting bigger and keep new clots from forming. Treatment may include medicines to thin the blood and slow its ability to clot. If your symptoms are life threatening, your doctor may give you medicine to quickly dissolve the clot. Rarely, your doctor may use surgery or another procedure to remove the clot. Medicines Anticoagulants (AN-te-ko-AG-u-lants), or blood thinners, decrease your blood's ability to clot. They're used to stop blood clots from getting larger and prevent clots from forming. Blood thinners don't break up blood clots that have already formed. (The body dissolves most clots with time.) You can take blood thinners as either a pill, an injection, or through a needle or tube inserted into a vein (called intravenous, or IV, injection). Warfarin is given as a pill. (Coumadin is a common brand name for warfarin.) Heparin is given as an injection or through an IV tube. Your doctor may treat you with both heparin and warfarin at the same time. Heparin acts quickly. Warfarin takes 2 to 3 days before it starts to work. Once warfarin starts to work, heparin usually is stopped. Pregnant women usually are treated with heparin only, because warfarin is dangerous for the pregnancy. If you have deep vein thrombosis, treatment with blood thinners usually lasts for 3 to 6months. If you've had blood clots before, you may need a longer period of treatment. If you're being treated for another illness, such as cancer, you may need to take blood thinners as long as PE risk factors are present. The most common side effect of blood thinners is bleeding. This can happen if the medicine thins your blood too much. This side effect can be life threatening. Sometimes the bleeding is internal, which is why people treated with blood thinners usually have routine blood tests. These tests, called PT and PTT tests, measure the blood's ability to clot. These tests also help your doctor make sure you're taking the right amount of medicine. Call your doctor right away if you're bruising or bleeding easily. Thrombin inhibitors are a newer type of blood-thinning medicine. They're used to treat some types of blood clots in people who can't take heparin. Emergency Treatment When PE is life threatening, a doctor may use treatments that remove or break up the blood clot. These treatments are given in an emergency room or hospital. Thrombolytics (THROM-bo-LIT-iks) are medicines that can quickly dissolve a blood clot. They're used to treat large clots that cause severe symptoms. Because thrombolytics can cause sudden bleeding, they're used only in life-threatening situations. Sometimes a doctor may use a catheter (a flexible tube) to reach the blood clot. The catheter is inserted into a vein in the groin (upper thigh) or arm and threaded to the clot in the lung. The doctor may use the catheter to remove the clot or deliver medicine to dissolve it. Rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the blood clot. Other Types of Treatment If you can't take medicines to thin your blood, or if the medicines don't work, your doctor may suggest a vena cava filter. This device keeps blood clots from traveling to your lungs. The filter is inserted inside a large vein called the inferior vena cava. (This vein carries blood from the body back to the heart). The filter catches clots before they travel to the lungs. This type of treatment can prevent PE, but it won't stop other blood clots from forming. Graduated compression stockings can reduce the chronic (ongoing) swelling that a blood clot in the leg may cause. Graduated compression stockings are worn on the legs from the arch of the foot to just above or below the knee. These stockings are tight at the ankle and become looser as they go up the leg. This causes gentle compression (pressure) up the leg. The pressure keeps blood from pooling and clotting."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Pulmonary Embolism ?","completion":"Preventing pulmonary embolism (PE) begins with preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Knowing whether you're at risk for DVT and taking steps to lower your risk are important. Exercise your lower leg muscles if you're sitting for a long time while traveling. Get out of bed and move around as soon as you're able after having surgery or being ill. The sooner you move around, the better your chance is of avoiding a blood clot. Take medicines to prevent clots after some types of surgery (as your doctor prescribes). Follow up with your doctor. If you've already had DVT or PE, you can take more steps to prevent new blood clots from forming. Visit your doctor for regular checkups. Also, use compression stockings to prevent chronic (ongoing) swelling in your legs from DVT (as your doctor advises). Contact your doctor right away if you have any signs or symptoms of DVT or PE."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Aneurysm ?","completion":"An aneurysm (AN-u-rism) is a balloon-like bulge in an artery. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to your body. Arteries have thick walls to withstand normal blood pressure. However, certain medical problems, genetic conditions, and trauma can damage or injure artery walls. The force of blood pushing against the weakened or injured walls can cause an aneurysm. An aneurysm can grow large and rupture (burst) or dissect. A rupture causes dangerous bleeding inside the body. A dissection is a split in one or more layers of the artery wall. The split causes bleeding into and along the layers of the artery wall. Both rupture and dissection often are fatal. Overview Most aneurysms occur in the aorta, the main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body. The aorta goes through the chest and abdomen. An aneurysm that occurs in the chest portion of the aorta is called a thoracic (tho-RAS-ik) aortic aneurysm. An aneurysm that occurs in the abdominal portion of the aorta is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Aneurysms also can occur in other arteries, but these types of aneurysm are less common. This article focuses on aortic aneurysms. About 13,000 Americans die each year from aortic aneurysms. Most of the deaths result from rupture or dissection. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent rupture and dissection. However, aneurysms can develop and grow large before causing any symptoms. Thus, people who are at high risk for aneurysms can benefit from early, routine screening. Outlook Doctors often can successfully treat aortic aneurysms with medicines or surgery if theyre found in time. Medicines may be given to lower blood pressure, relax blood vessels, and reduce the risk of rupture. Large aortic aneurysms often can be repaired with surgery. During surgery, the weak or damaged portion of the aorta is replaced or reinforced."},{"prompt":"What causes Aneurysm ?","completion":"The force of blood pushing against the walls of an artery combined with damage or injury to the arterys walls can cause an aneurysm. Many conditions and factors can damage and weaken the walls of the aorta and cause aortic aneurysms. Examples include aging, smoking, high blood pressure, and atherosclerosis (ath-er-o-skler-O-sis). Atherosclerosis is the hardening and narrowing of the arteries due to the buildup of a waxy substance called plaque (plak). Rarely, infectionssuch as untreated syphilis (a sexually transmitted infection)can cause aortic aneurysms. Aortic aneurysms also can occur as a result of diseases that inflame the blood vessels, such as vasculitis (vas-kyu-LI-tis). A family history of aneurysms also may play a role in causing aortic aneurysms. In addition to the factors above, certain genetic conditions may cause thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs). Examples of these conditions include Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (the vascular type), and Turner syndrome. These genetic conditions can weaken the bodys connective tissues and damage the aorta. People who have these conditions tend to develop aneurysms at a younger age than other people. Theyre also at higher risk for rupture and dissection. Trauma, such as a car accident, also can damage the walls of the aorta and lead to TAAs. Researchers continue to look for other causes of aortic aneurysms. For example, theyre looking for genetic mutations (changes in the genes) that may contribute to or cause aneurysms."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Aneurysm? ?","completion":"Certain factors put you at higher risk for an aortic aneurysm. These factors include: Male gender. Men are more likely than women to have aortic aneurysms. Age. The risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms increases as you get older. These aneurysms are more likely to occur in people who are aged 65 or older. Smoking. Smoking can damage and weaken the walls of the aorta. A family history of aortic aneurysms. People who have family histories of aortic aneurysms are at higher risk for the condition, and they may have aneurysms before the age of 65. A history of aneurysms in the arteries of the legs. Certain diseases and conditions that weaken the walls of the aorta. Examples include high blood pressure and atherosclerosis. Having a bicuspid aortic valve can raise the risk of having a thoracic aortic aneurysm. A bicuspid aortic valve has two leaflets instead of the typical three. Car accidents or trauma also can injure the arteries and increase the risk for aneurysms. If you have any of these risk factors, talk with your doctor about whether you need screening for aneurysms."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Aneurysm ?","completion":"The signs and symptoms of an aortic aneurysm depend on the type and location of the aneurysm. Signs and symptoms also depend on whether the aneurysm has ruptured (burst) or is affecting other parts of the body. Aneurysms can develop and grow for years without causing any signs or symptoms. They often don't cause signs or symptoms until they rupture, grow large enough to press on nearby body parts, or block blood flow. Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Most abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) develop slowly over years. They often don't cause signs or symptoms unless they rupture. If you have an AAA, your doctor may feel a throbbing mass while checking your abdomen. When symptoms are present, they can include: A throbbing feeling in the abdomen Deep pain in your back or the side of your abdomen Steady, gnawing pain in your abdomen that lasts for hours or days If an AAA ruptures, symptoms may include sudden, severe pain in your lower abdomen and back; nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and vomiting; constipation and problems with urination; clammy, sweaty skin; light-headedness; and a rapid heart rate when standing up. Internal bleeding from a ruptured AAA can send you into shock. Shock is a life-threatening condition in which blood pressure drops so low that the brain, kidneys, and other vital organs can't get enough blood to work well. Shock can be fatal if its not treated right away. Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms A thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) may not cause symptoms until it dissects or grows large. If you have symptoms, they may include: Pain in your jaw, neck, back, or chest Coughing and/or hoarseness Shortness of breath and/or trouble breathing or swallowing A dissection is a split in one or more layers of the artery wall. The split causes bleeding into and along the layers of the artery wall. If a TAA ruptures or dissects, you may feel sudden, severe, sharp or stabbing pain starting in your upper back and moving down into your abdomen. You may have pain in your chest and arms, and you can quickly go into shock. If you have any symptoms of TAA or aortic dissection, call 911. If left untreated, these conditions may lead to organ damage or death."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Aneurysm ?","completion":"If you have an aortic aneurysm but no symptoms, your doctor may find it by chance during a routine physical exam. More often, doctors find aneurysms during tests done for other reasons, such as chest or abdominal pain. If you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), your doctor may feel a throbbing mass in your abdomen. A rapidly growing aneurysm about to rupture (burst) can be tender and very painful when pressed. If you're overweight or obese, it may be hard for your doctor to feel even a large AAA. If you have an AAA, your doctor may hear rushing blood flow instead of the normal whooshing sound when listening to your abdomen with a stethoscope. Specialists Involved Your primary care doctor may refer you to a cardiothoracic or vascular surgeon for diagnosis and treatment of an aortic aneurysm. A cardiothoracic surgeon does surgery on the heart, lungs, and other organs and structures in the chest, including the aorta. A vascular surgeon does surgery on the aorta and other blood vessels, except those of the heart and brain. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures To diagnose and study an aneurysm, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests. Ultrasound and Echocardiography Ultrasound and echocardiography (echo) are simple, painless tests that use sound waves to create pictures of the structures inside your body. These tests can show the size of an aortic aneurysm, if one is found. Computed Tomography Scan A computed tomography scan, or CT scan, is a painless test that uses x rays to take clear, detailed pictures of your organs. During the test, your doctor will inject dye into a vein in your arm. The dye makes your arteries, including your aorta, visible on the CT scan pictures. Your doctor may recommend this test if he or she thinks you have an AAA or a thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA). A CT scan can show the size and shape of an aneurysm. This test provides more detailed pictures than an ultrasound or echo. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the organs and structures in your body. This test works well for detecting aneurysms and pinpointing their size and exact location. Angiography Angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your arteries. This test shows the amount of damage and blockage in blood vessels. Aortic angiography shows the inside of your aorta. The test may show the location and size of an aortic aneurysm."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Aneurysm ?","completion":"Aortic aneurysms are treated with medicines and surgery. Small aneurysms that are found early and arent causing symptoms may not need treatment. Other aneurysms need to be treated. The goals of treatment may include: Preventing the aneurysm from growing Preventing or reversing damage to other body structures Preventing or treating a rupture or dissection Allowing you to continue doing your normal daily activities Treatment for an aortic aneurysm is based on its size. Your doctor may recommend routine testing to make sure an aneurysm isn't getting bigger. This method usually is used for aneurysms that are smaller than 5 centimeters (about 2 inches) across. How often you need testing (for example, every few months or every year) is based on the size of the aneurysm and how fast it's growing. The larger it is and the faster it's growing, the more often you may need to be checked. Medicines If you have an aortic aneurysm, your doctor may prescribe medicines before surgery or instead of surgery. Medicines are used to lower blood pressure, relax blood vessels, and lower the risk that the aneurysm will rupture (burst). Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are the medicines most commonly used. Surgery Your doctor may recommend surgery if your aneurysm is growing quickly or is at risk of rupture or dissection. The two main types of surgery to repair aortic aneurysms are open abdominal or open chest repair and endovascular repair. Open Abdominal or Open Chest Repair The standard and most common type of surgery for aortic aneurysms is open abdominal or open chest repair. This surgery involves a major incision (cut) in the abdomen or chest. General anesthesia (AN-es-THE-ze-ah) is used during this procedure. The term anesthesia refers to a loss of feeling and awareness. General anesthesia temporarily puts you to sleep. During the surgery, the aneurysm is removed. Then, the section of aorta is replaced with a graft made of material such as Dacron or Teflon. The surgery takes 3 to 6 hours; youll remain in the hospital for 5 to 8 days. If needed, repair of the aortic heart valve also may be done during open abdominal or open chest surgery. It often takes a month to recover from open abdominal or open chest surgery and return to full activity. Most patients make a full recovery. Endovascular Repair In endovascular repair, the aneurysm isn't removed. Instead, a graft is inserted into the aorta to strengthen it. Surgeons do this type of surgery using catheters (tubes) inserted into the arteries; it doesn't require surgically opening the chest or abdomen. General anesthesia is used during this procedure. The surgeon first inserts a catheter into an artery in the groin (upper thigh) and threads it to the aneurysm. Then, using an x ray to see the artery, the surgeon threads the graft (also called a stent graft) into the aorta to the aneurysm. The graft is then expanded inside the aorta and fastened in place to form a stable channel for blood flow. The graft reinforces the weakened section of the aorta. This helps prevent the aneurysm from rupturing. Endovascular Repair The illustration shows the placement of a stent graft in an aortic aneurysm. In figure A, a catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin (upper thigh). The catheter is threaded to the abdominal aorta, and the stent graft is released from the catheter. In figure B, the stent graft allows blood to flow through the aneurysm. The recovery time for endovascular repair is less than the recovery time for open abdominal or open chest repair. However, doctors cant repair all aortic aneurysms with endovascular repair. The location or size of an aneurysm may prevent the use of a stent graft."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Aneurysm ?","completion":"The best way to prevent an aortic aneurysm is to avoid the factors that put you at higher risk for one. You cant control all aortic aneurysm risk factors, but lifestyle changes can help you lower some risks. For example, if you smoke, try to quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index (DCI) Smoking and Your Heart article. Another important lifestyle change is following a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products. A healthy diet is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site, \\"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart,\\" and \\"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH.\\" All of these resources include general information about healthy eating. Be as physically active as you can. Talk with your doctor about the amounts and types of physical activity that are safe for you. For more information about physical activity, go to the DCI Physical Activity and Your Heart article and the NHLBIs \\"Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.\\" Work with your doctor to control medical conditions such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol. Follow your treatment plans and take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes. Screening for Aneurysms Although you may not be able to prevent an aneurysm, early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent rupture and dissection. Aneurysms can develop and grow large before causing any signs or symptoms. Thus, people who are at high risk for aneurysms may benefit from early, routine screening. Your doctor may recommend routine screening if youre: A man between the ages of 65 and 75 who has ever smoked A man or woman between the ages of 65 and 75 who has a family history of aneurysms If youre at risk, but not in one of these high-risk groups, ask your doctor whether screening will benefit you."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Pulmonary Hypertension ?","completion":"Pulmonary hypertension (PULL-mun-ary HI-per-TEN-shun), or PH, is increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries. These arteries carry blood from your heart to your lungs to pick up oxygen. PH causes symptoms such as shortness of breath during routine activity (for example, climbing two flights of stairs), tiredness, chest pain, and a racing heartbeat. As the condition worsens, its symptoms may limit all physical activity. Overview To understand PH, it helps to understand how your heart and lungs work. Your heart has two sides, separated by an inner wall called the septum. Each side of your heart has an upper and lower chamber. The lower right chamber of your heart, the right ventricle (VEN-trih-kul), pumps blood to your pulmonary arteries. The blood then travels to your lungs, where it picks up oxygen. The upper left chamber of your heart, the left atrium (AY-tree-um), receives the oxygen-rich blood from your lungs. The blood is then pumped into the lower left chamber of your heart, the left ventricle. From the left ventricle, the blood is pumped to the rest of your body through an artery called the aorta. For more information about the heart and lungs, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Heart Works and How the Lungs Work articles. PH begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. As a result, the pressure in your arteries rises. Also, because your heart is working harder than normal, your right ventricle becomes strained and weak. Your heart may become so weak that it can't pump enough blood to your lungs. This causes heart failure. Heart failure is the most common cause of death in people who have PH. PH is divided into five groups based on its causes. In all groups, the average pressure in the pulmonary arteries is higher than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity. The pressure in normal pulmonary arteries is 820 mmHg at rest. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.) Other diseases or conditions, such as heart and lung diseases or blood clots, usually cause PH. Some people inherit the condition (that is, their parents pass the genes for PH on to them). In some cases, the cause isn't known. Outlook PH has no cure. However, research for new treatments is ongoing. The earlier PH is treated, the easier it is to control. Treatments include medicines, procedures, and other therapies. These treatments can relieve PH symptoms and slow the progress of the disease. Lifestyle changes also can help control symptoms."},{"prompt":"What causes Pulmonary Hypertension ?","completion":"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries.

At this point, other signs and symptoms may include: Feeling light-headed, especially during physical activity Fainting at times Swelling in your legs and ankles A bluish color on your lips and skin"},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Pulmonary Hypertension ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose pulmonary hypertension (PH) based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures. PH can develop slowly. In fact, you may have it for years and not know it. This is because the condition has no early signs or symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they're often like those of other heart and lung conditions, such as asthma. This makes PH hard to diagnose. Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask about your signs and symptoms and how and when they began. He or she also may ask whether you have other medical conditions that can cause PH. Your doctor will want to know whether you have any family members who have or have had PH. People who have a family history of PH are at higher risk for the condition. Physical Exam During the physical exam, your doctor will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. He or she also will check your ankles and legs for swelling and your lips and skin for a bluish color. These are signs of PH. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures Your doctor may recommend tests and procedures to confirm a diagnosis of PH and to look for its underlying cause. Your doctor also will use test results to find out the severity of your PH. Tests and Procedures To Confirm a Diagnosis Echocardiography. Echocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. This test can estimate the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. Echo also can show the size and thickness of your right ventricle and how well it's working. Chest x ray. A chest x ray takes pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test can show whether your pulmonary arteries and right ventricle are enlarged. The pulmonary arteries and right ventricle may get larger if the right ventricle has to work hard to pump blood through the pulmonary arteries. A chest x ray also may show signs of an underlying lung disease that's causing or contributing to PH. EKG (electrocardiogram). An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. This test also shows whether your heart's rhythm is steady or irregular. An EKG may show whether your right ventricle is enlarged or strained. Right heart catheterization. This procedure measures the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. It also shows how well your heart is pumping blood to the rest of your body. Right heart catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun) can find any leaks between the left and right side of the heart. During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your groin (upper thigh) or neck. The tube is threaded into the right side of your heart and into the pulmonary arteries. Through the tube, your doctor can do tests and treatments on your heart. Tests To Look for the Underlying Cause of Pulmonary Hypertension PH has many causes, so many tests may need to be done to find its underlying cause. Chest CT scan. A chest computed tomography (to-MOG-ra-fee) scan, or chest CT scan, creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. These pictures can show signs of PH or a condition that may be causing PH. Chest MRI. Chest magnetic resonance imaging, or chest MRI, shows how your right ventricle is working. The test also shows blood flow in your lungs. Chest MRI also can help detect signs of PH or an underlying condition causing PH. Lung function tests. Lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can help detect a lung disease that may be causing PH. Polysomnogram (PSG). This test records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure while you sleep. A PSG also measures the level of oxygen in your blood. A low oxygen level during sleep is common in PH, and it can make the condition worse. A PSG usually is done while you stay overnight at a sleep center. For more information about this test, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Sleep Studies article. Lung ventilation/perfusion (VQ) scan. A lung VQ scan measures air and blood flow in your lungs. This test can help detect blood clots in your lung's blood vessels. Blood tests. Blood tests are used to rule out other diseases, such as HIV, liver disease, and autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis). Finding Out the Severity of Pulmonary Hypertension Exercise testing is used to find out the severity of PH. This testing consists of either a 6-minute walk test or a cardiopulmonary exercise test. A 6-minute walk test measures the distance you can quickly walk in 6 minutes. A cardiopulmonary exercise test measures how well your lungs and heart work while you exercise on a treadmill or bicycle. During exercise testing, your doctor will rate your activity level. Your level is linked to the severity of your PH. The rating system ranges from class 1 to class 4. Class 1 has no limits. You can do regular physical activities, such as walking or climbing stairs. These activities don't cause PH symptoms, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Class 2 has slight or mild limits. You're comfortable while resting, but regular physical activity causes PH symptoms. Class 3 has marked or noticeable limits. You're comfortable while resting. However, walking even one or two blocks or climbing one flight of stairs can cause PH symptoms. Class 4 has severe limits. You're not able to do any physical activity without discomfort. You also may have PH symptoms while at rest. Over time, you may need more exercise tests to find out how well your treatments are working. Each time testing is done, your doctor will compare your activity level with the previous one."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Pulmonary Hypertension ?","completion":"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) has no cure. However, treatment may help relieve symptoms and slow the progress of the disease. PH is treated with medicines, procedures, and other therapies. Treatment will depend on what type of PH you have and its severity. (For more information, go to \\"Types of Pulmonary Hypertension.\\") Group 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) includes PH that's inherited, that has no known cause, or that's caused by certain drugs or conditions. Treatments for group 1 PAH include medicines and medical procedures. Medicines Your doctor may prescribe medicines to relax the blood vessels in your lungs and reduce excess cell growth in the blood vessels. As the blood vessels relax, more blood can flow through them. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that are taken by mouth, inhaled, or injected. Examples of medicines for group 1 PAH include: Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil Prostanoids, such as epoprostenol Endothelin receptor antagonists, such as bosentan and ambrisentan Calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem Your doctor may prescribe one or more of these medicines. To find out which of these medicines works best, you'll likely have an acute vasoreactivity test. This test shows how the pressure in your pulmonary arteries reacts to certain medicines. The test is done during right heart catheterization. Medical and Surgical Procedures If you have group 1 PAH, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following procedures. Atrial septostomy (sep-TOS-toe-me). For this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your leg and threaded to your heart. The tube is then put through the wall that separates your right and left atria (the upper chambers of your heart). This wall is called the septum. A tiny balloon on the tip of the tube is inflated. This creates an opening between the atria. This procedure relieves the pressure in the right atria and increases blood flow. Atrial septostomy is rarely done in the United States. Lung transplant. A lung transplant is surgery to replace a person's diseased lung with a healthy lung from a deceased donor. This procedure may be used for people who have severe lung disease that's causing PAH. Heartlung transplant. A heartlung transplant is surgery in which both the heart and lung are replaced with healthy organs from a deceased donor. Group 2 Pulmonary Hypertension Conditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as mitral valve disease, can cause group 2 PH. Treating the underlying condition will help treat PH. Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medicines, and surgery. Group 3 Pulmonary Hypertension Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial lung disease, can cause group 3 PH. Certain sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, also can cause group 3 PH. If you have this type of PH, you may need oxygen therapy. This treatment raises the level of oxygen in your blood. You'll likely get the oxygen through soft, plastic prongs that fit into your nose. Oxygen therapy can be done at home or in a hospital. Your doctor also may recommend other treatments if you have an underlying lung disease. Group 4 Pulmonary Hypertension Blood clots in the lungs or blood clotting disorders can cause group 4 PH. If you have this type of PH, your doctor will likely prescribe blood-thinning medicines. These medicines prevent clots from forming or getting larger. Sometimes doctors use surgery to remove scarring in the pulmonary arteries due to old blood clots. Group 5 Pulmonary Hypertension Various diseases and conditions, such as thyroid disease and sarcoidosis, can cause group 5 PH. An object, such as a tumor, pressing on the pulmonary arteries also can cause group 5 PH. Group 5 PH is treated by treating its cause. All Types of Pulmonary Hypertension Several treatments may be used for all types of PH. These treatments include: Diuretics, also called water pills. These medicines help reduce fluid buildup in your body, including swelling in your ankles and feet. Blood-thinning medicines. These medicines help prevent blood clots from forming or getting larger. Digoxin. This medicine helps the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. Digoxin sometimes is used to control the heart rate if abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, occur. Oxygen therapy. This treatment raises the level of oxygen in your blood. Physical activity. Regular activity may help improve your ability to be active. Talk with your doctor about a physical activity plan that's safe for you. Research is ongoing for better PH treatments. These treatments offer hope for the future."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Deep Vein Thrombosis ?","completion":"Espaol Deep vein thrombosis (throm-BO-sis), or DVT, is a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body. Blood clots occur when blood thickens and clumps together. Most deep vein blood clots occur in the lower leg or thigh. They also can occur in other parts of the body. A blood clot in a deep vein can break off and travel through the bloodstream. The loose clot is called an embolus (EM-bo-lus). It can travel to an artery in the lungs and block blood flow. This condition is called pulmonary embolism (PULL-mun-ary EM-bo-lizm), or PE. PE is a very serious condition. It can damage the lungs and other organs in the body and cause death. Blood clots in the thighs are more likely to break off and cause PE than blood clots in the lower legs or other parts of the body. Blood clots also can form in veins closer to the skin's surface.

He or she will identify your risk factors and rule out other causes of your symptoms. For some people, DVT might not be diagnosed until after they receive emergency treatment for pulmonary embolism (PE). Medical History To learn about your medical history, your doctor may ask about: Your overall health Any prescription medicines you're taking Any recent surgeries or injuries you've had Whether you've been treated for cancer Physical Exam Your doctor will check your legs for signs of DVT, such as swelling or redness. He or she also will check your blood pressure and your heart and lungs. Diagnostic Tests Your doctor may recommend tests to find out whether you have DVT. Common Tests The most common test for diagnosing deep vein blood clots is ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to create pictures of blood flowing through the arteries and veins in the affected leg. Your doctor also may recommend a D-dimer test or venography (ve-NOG-rah-fee). A D-dimer test measures a substance in the blood that's released when a blood clot dissolves. If the test shows high levels of the substance, you may have a deep vein blood clot. If your test results are normal and you have few risk factors, DVT isn't likely. Your doctor may suggest venography if an ultrasound doesn't provide a clear diagnosis. For venography, dye is injected into a vein in the affected leg. The dye makes the vein visible on an x-ray image. The x ray will show whether blood flow is slow in the vein, which may suggest a blood clot. Other Tests Other tests used to diagnose DVT include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee), or CT, scanning. These tests create pictures of your organs and tissues. You may need blood tests to check whether you have an inherited blood clotting disorder that can cause DVT. This may be the case if you have repeated blood clots that are not related to another cause. Blood clots in an unusual location (such as the liver, kidney, or brain) also may suggest an inherited clotting disorder. If your doctor thinks that you have PE, he or she may recommend more tests, such as a lung ventilation perfusion scan (VQ scan). A lung VQ scan shows how well oxygen and blood are flowing to all areas of the lungs. For more information about diagnosing PE, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Embolism article."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Deep Vein Thrombosis ?","completion":"Doctors treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with medicines and other devices and therapies. The main goals of treating DVT are to: Stop the blood clot from getting bigger Prevent the blood clot from breaking off and moving to your lungs Reduce your chance of having another blood clot Medicines Your doctor may prescribe medicines to prevent or treat DVT. Anticoagulants Anticoagulants (AN-te-ko-AG-u-lants) are the most common medicines for treating DVT. They're also known as blood thinners. These medicines decrease your blood's ability to clot. They also stop existing blood clots from getting bigger. However, blood thinners can't break up blood clots that have already formed. (The body dissolves most blood clots with time.) Blood thinners can be taken as a pill, an injection under the skin, or through a needle or tube inserted into a vein (called intravenous, or IV, injection). Warfarin and heparin are two blood thinners used to treat DVT. Warfarin is given in pill form. (Coumadin is a common brand name for warfarin.) Heparin is given as an injection or through an IV tube. There are different types of heparin. Your doctor will discuss the options with you. Your doctor may treat you with both heparin and warfarin at the same time. Heparin acts quickly. Warfarin takes 2 to 3 days before it starts to work. Once the warfarin starts to work, the heparin is stopped. Pregnant women usually are treated with just heparin because warfarin is dangerous during pregnancy. Treatment for DVT using blood thinners usually lasts for 6 months. The following situations may change the length of treatment: If your blood clot occurred after a short-term risk (for example, surgery), your treatment time may be shorter. If you've had blood clots before, your treatment time may be longer. If you have certain other illnesses, such as cancer, you may need to take blood thinners for as long as you have the illness. The most common side effect of blood thinners is bleeding. Bleeding can happen if the medicine thins your blood too much. This side effect can be life threatening. Sometimes the bleeding is internal (inside your body). People treated with blood thinners usually have regular blood tests to measure their blood's ability to clot. These tests are called PT and PTT tests. These tests also help your doctor make sure you're taking the right amount of medicine. Call your doctor right away if you have easy bruising or bleeding. These may be signs that your medicines have thinned your blood too much. Thrombin Inhibitors These medicines interfere with the blood clotting process. They're used to treat blood clots in patients who can't take heparin. Thrombolytics Doctors prescribe these medicines to quickly dissolve large blood clots that cause severe symptoms. Because thrombolytics can cause sudden bleeding, they're used only in life-threatening situations. Other Types of Treatment Vena Cava Filter If you can't take blood thinners or they're not working well, your doctor may recommend a vena cava filter. The filter is inserted inside a large vein called the vena cava. The filter catches blood clots before they travel to the lungs, which prevents pulmonary embolism. However, the filter doesn't stop new blood clots from forming. Graduated Compression Stockings Graduated compression stockings can reduce leg swelling caused by a blood clot. These stockings are worn on the legs from the arch of the foot to just above or below the knee. Compression stockings are tight at the ankle and become looser as they go up the leg. This creates gentle pressure up the leg. The pressure keeps blood from pooling and clotting. There are three types of compression stockings. One type is support pantyhose, which offer the least amount of pressure. The second type is over-the-counter compression hose. These stockings give a little more pressure than support pantyhose. Over-the-counter compression hose are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies. Prescription-strength compression hose offer the greatest amount of pressure. They also are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies. However, a specially trained person needs to fit you for these stockings. Talk with your doctor about how long you should wear compression stockings."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis ?","completion":"You can take steps to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). If you're at risk for these conditions: See your doctor for regular checkups. Take all medicines as your doctor prescribes.

However, some palpitations are signs of a heart problem. Sometimes the cause of palpitations can't be found. If you start having palpitations, see your doctor to have them checked. Causes Not Related to Heart Problems Strong Emotions You may feel your heart pounding or racing during anxiety, fear, or stress. You also may have these feelings if you're having a panic attack. Vigorous Physical Activity Intense activity can make your heart feel like its beating too hard or too fast, even though it's working normally. Intense activity also can cause occasional premature (extra) heartbeats. Medical Conditions Some medical conditions can cause palpitations. These conditions can make the heart beat faster or stronger than usual. They also can cause premature (extra) heartbeats. Examples of these medical conditions include: An overactive thyroid A low blood sugar level Anemia Some types of low blood pressure Fever Dehydration (not enough fluid in the body) Hormonal Changes The hormonal changes that happen during pregnancy, menstruation, and the perimenopausal period may cause palpitations. The palpitations will likely improve or go away as these conditions go away or change. Some palpitations that occur during pregnancy may be due to anemia. Medicines and Stimulants Many medicines can trigger palpitations because they can make the heart beat faster or stronger than usual. Medicines also can cause premature (extra) heartbeats. Examples of these medicines include: Inhaled asthma medicines. Medicines to treat an underactive thyroid. Taking too much of these medicines can cause an overactive thyroid and lead to palpitations. Medicines to prevent arrhythmias. Medicines used to treat irregular heart rhythms can sometimes cause other irregular heart rhythms. Over-the-counter medicines that act as stimulants also may cause palpitations. These include decongestants (found in cough and cold medicines) and some herbal and nutritional supplements. Caffeine, nicotine (found in tobacco), alcohol, and illegal drugs (such as cocaine and amphetamines) also can cause palpitations. Causes Related to Heart Problems Some palpitations are symptoms of arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. However, less than half of the people who have palpitations have arrhythmias. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. An arrhythmia happens if some part of the heart's electrical system doesn't work as it should. Palpitations are more likely to be related to an arrhythmia if you: Have had a heart attack or are at risk for one. Have coronary heart disease (CHD) or risk factors for CHD. Have other heart problems, such as heart failure, heart valve disease, or heart muscle disease. Have abnormal electrolyte levels. Electrolytes are minerals, such as potassium and sodium, found in blood and body fluids. They're vital for normal health and functioning of the body."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Heart Palpitations? ?","completion":"Some people may be more likely than others to have palpitations.

Even so, see your doctor again if your palpitations: Start to occur more often or are more noticeable or bothersome Occur with other symptoms, such as those listed above Your doctor will want to check whether your palpitations are the symptom of a heart problem, such as an arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Heart Palpitations ?","completion":"First, your doctor will want to find out whether your palpitations are harmless or related to a heart problem. He or she will ask about your symptoms and medical history, do a physical exam, and recommend several basic tests. This information may point to a heart problem as the cause of your palpitations. If so, your doctor may recommend more tests. These tests will help show what the problem is, so your doctor can decide how to treat it. The cause of palpitations may be hard to diagnose, especially if symptoms don't occur regularly. Specialists Involved Several types of doctors may work with you to diagnose and treat your palpitations. These include a: Primary care doctor Cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases and conditions) Electrophysiologist (a cardiologist who specializes in the heart's electrical system) Medical History Your doctor will ask questions about your palpitations, such as: When did they begin? How long do they last? How often do they occur? Do they start and stop suddenly? Does your heartbeat feel steady or irregular during the palpitations? Do other symptoms occur with the palpitations? Do your palpitations have a pattern? For example, do they occur when you exercise or drink coffee? Do they happen at a certain time of day? Your doctor also may ask about your use of caffeine, alcohol, supplements, and illegal drugs. Physical Exam Your doctor will take your pulse to find out how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is normal. He or she also will use a stethoscope to listen to your heartbeat. Your doctor may look for signs of conditions that can cause palpitations, such as an overactive thyroid. Diagnostic Tests Often, the first test that's done is an EKG (electrocardiogram). This simple test records your heart's electrical activity. An EKG shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). It also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart. Even if your EKG results are normal, you may still have a medical condition that's causing palpitations. If your doctor suspects this is the case, you may have blood tests to gather more information about your heart's structure, function, and electrical system. Holter or Event Monitor A standard EKG only records the heartbeat for a few seconds. It won't detect heart rhythm problems that don't happen during the test. To diagnose problems that come and go, your doctor may have you wear a Holter or event monitor. A Holter monitor records the hearts electrical activity for a full 24- or 48-hour period. You wear patches called electrodes on your chest. Wires connect the patches to a small, portable recorder. The recorder can be clipped to a belt, kept in a pocket, or hung around your neck. During the 24- or 48-hour period, you do your usual daily activities. You use a notebook to record any symptoms you have and the time they occur. You then return both the recorder and the notebook to your doctor to read the results. Your doctor can see how your heart was beating at the time you had symptoms. An event monitor is similar to a Holter monitor. You wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities. However, an event monitor only records your heart's electrical activity at certain times while you're wearing it. For many event monitors, you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms. Other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms. You can wear an event monitor for weeks or until symptoms occur. Holter or Event Monitor Echocardiography Echocardiography uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The picture shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working. The test also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow. Stress Test Some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. During stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you cant exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Heart Palpitations ?","completion":"Treatment for palpitations depends on their cause. Most palpitations are harmless and often go away on their own. In these cases, no treatment is needed. Avoiding Triggers Your palpitations may be harmless but bothersome. If so, your doctor may suggest avoiding things that trigger them. For examples, your doctor may advise you to: Reduce anxiety and stress. Anxiety and stress (including panic attacks) are a common cause of harmless palpitations. Relaxation exercises, yoga or tai chi, biofeedback or guided imagery, or aromatherapy may help you relax. Avoid or limit stimulants, such as caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol. Avoid illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines. Avoid medicines that act as stimulants, such as cough and cold medicines and some herbal and nutritional supplements. Treating Medical Conditions That May Cause Palpitations Work with your doctor to control medical conditions that can cause palpitations, such as an overactive thyroid. If you're taking medicine that's causing palpitations, your doctor will try to find a different medicine for you. If your palpitations are caused by an arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), your doctor may recommend medicines or procedures to treat the problem.

BPD mostly affects premature infants who need oxygen therapy (oxygen given through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube). Most infants who develop BPD are born more than 10 weeks before their due dates, weigh less than 2 pounds (about 1,000 grams) at birth, and have breathing problems. Infections that occur before or shortly after birth also can contribute to BPD. Some infants who have BPD may need long-term breathing support from nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) machines or ventilators. Overview Many babies who develop BPD are born with serious respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). RDS is a breathing disorder that mostly affects premature newborns. These infants' lungs aren't fully formed or aren't able to make enough surfactant (sur-FAK-tant). Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep them open so an infant can breathe in air once he or she is born. Without surfactant, the lungs collapse, and the infant has to work hard to breathe. He or she might not be able to breathe in enough oxygen to support the body's organs. Without proper treatment, the lack of oxygen may damage the infant's brain and other organs. Babies who have RDS are treated with surfactant replacement therapy. They also may need oxygen therapy. Shortly after birth, some babies who have RDS also are treated with NCPAP or ventilators (machines that support breathing). Often, the symptoms of RDS start to improve slowly after about a week. However, some babies get worse and need more oxygen or breathing support from NCPAP or a ventilator. If premature infants still require oxygen therapy by the time they reach their original due dates, they're diagnosed with BPD. Outlook Advances in care now make it possible for more premature infants to survive. However, these infants are at high risk for BPD. Most babies who have BPD get better in time, but they may need treatment for months or even years. They may continue to have lung problems throughout childhood and even into adulthood. There's some concern about whether people who had BPD as babies can ever have normal lung function. As children who have BPD grow, their parents can help reduce the risk of BPD complications. Parents can encourage healthy eating habits and good nutrition. They also can avoid cigarette smoke and other lung irritants."},{"prompt":"What causes Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia ?","completion":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) develops as a result of an infant's lungs becoming irritated or inflamed. The lungs of premature infants are fragile and often aren't fully developed. They can easily be irritated or injured within hours or days of birth. Many factors can damage premature infants' lungs. Ventilation Newborns who have breathing problems or can't breathe on their own may need ventilator support. Ventilators are machines that use pressure to blow air into the airways and lungs. Although ventilator support can help premature infants survive, the machine's pressure might irritate and harm the babies' lungs. For this reason, doctors only recommend ventilator support when necessary. High Levels of Oxygen Newborns who have breathing problems might need oxygen therapy (oxygen given through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube). This treatment helps the infants' organs get enough oxygen to work well. However, high levels of oxygen can inflame the lining of the lungs and injure the airways. Also, high levels of oxygen can slow lung development in premature infants. Infections Infections can inflame the lungs. As a result, the airways narrow, which makes it harder for premature infants to breathe. Lung infections also increase the babies' need for extra oxygen and breathing support. Heredity Studies show that heredity may play a role in causing BPD. More studies are needed to confirm this finding."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia? ?","completion":"The more premature an infant is and the lower his or her birth weight, the greater the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

Infections that occur before or shortly after birth also can contribute to BPD. The number of babies who have BPD is higher now than in the past. This is because of advances in care that help more premature infants survive. Many babies who develop BPD are born with serious respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). However, some babies who have mild RDS or don't have RDS also develop BPD. These babies often have very low birth weights and one or more other conditions, such as patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and sepsis. PDA is a heart problem that occurs soon after birth in some babies.

Infants who have severe BPD may have trouble feeding, which can lead to delayed growth. These babies also may develop: Pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH is increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries. These arteries carry blood from the heart to the lungs to pick up oxygen. Cor pulmonale. Cor pulmonale is failure of the right side of the heart. Ongoing high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries and the lower right chamber of the heart causes this condition."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia ?","completion":"Infants who are born earlyusually more than 10 weeks before their due datesand still need oxygen therapy by the time they reach their original due dates are diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD can be mild, moderate, or severe. The diagnosis depends on how much extra oxygen a baby needs at the time of his or her original due date. It also depends on how long the baby needs oxygen therapy. To help confirm a diagnosis of BPD, doctors may recommend tests, such as: Chest x ray. A chest x ray takes pictures of the structures inside the chest, such as the heart and lungs. In severe cases of BPD, this test may show large areas of air and signs of inflammation or infection in the lungs. A chest x ray also can detect problems (such as a collapsed lung) and show whether the lungs aren't developing normally. Blood tests. Blood tests are used to see whether an infant has enough oxygen in his or her blood. Blood tests also can help determine whether an infection is causing an infant's breathing problems. Echocardiography. This test uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. Echocardiography is used to rule out heart defects or pulmonary hypertension as the cause of an infant's breathing problems"},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia ?","completion":"Preventive Measures If your doctor thinks you're going to give birth too early, he or she may give you injections of a corticosteroid medicine. The medicine can speed up surfactant production in your baby. Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep the lungs open so your infant can breathe in air once he or she is born. Corticosteroids also can help your baby's lungs, brain, and kidneys develop more quickly while he or she is in the womb. Premature babies who have very low birth weights also might be given corticosteroids within the first few days of birth. Doctors sometimes prescribe inhaled nitric oxide shortly after birth for babies who have very low birth weights. This treatment can help improve the babies' lung function. These preventive measures may help reduce infants' risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which can lead to BPD. Treatment for Respiratory Distress Syndrome The goals of treating infants who have RDS include: Reducing further injury to the lungs Providing nutrition and other support to help the lungs grow and recover Preventing lung infections by giving antibiotics Treatment of RDS usually begins as soon as an infant is born, sometimes in the delivery room. Most infants who have signs of RDS are quickly moved to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). They receive around-the-clock treatment from health care professionals who specialize in treating premature infants. Treatments for RDS include surfactant replacement therapy, breathing support with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) or a ventilator, oxygen therapy (oxygen given through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube), and medicines to treat fluid buildup in the lungs. For more information about RDS treatments, go to the Health Topics Respiratory Distress Syndrome article. Treatment for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Treatment in the NICU is designed to limit stress on infants and meet their basic needs of warmth, nutrition, and protection. Once doctors diagnose BPD, some or all of the treatments used for RDS will continue in the NICU. Such treatment usually includes: Using radiant warmers or incubators to keep infants warm and reduce the risk of infection. Ongoing monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and temperature through sensors taped to the babies' bodies. Using sensors on fingers or toes to check the amount of oxygen in the infants' blood. Giving fluids and nutrients through needles or tubes inserted into the infants' veins. This helps prevent malnutrition and promotes growth. Nutrition is vital to the growth and development of the lungs. Later, babies may be given breast milk or infant formula through feeding tubes that are passed through their noses or mouths and into their throats. Checking fluid intake to make sure that fluid doesn't build up in the babies' lungs. As BPD improves, babies are slowly weaned off NCPAP or ventilators until they can breathe on their own. These infants will likely need oxygen therapy for some time. If your infant has moderate or severe BPD, echocardiography might be done every few weeks to months to check his or her pulmonary artery pressure. If your child needs long-term ventilator support, he or she will likely get a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-toe-me). A tracheostomy is a surgically made hole. It goes through the front of the neck and into the trachea (TRA-ke-ah), or windpipe. Your child's doctor will put the breathing tube from the ventilator through the hole. Using a tracheostomy instead of an endotracheal (en-do-TRA-ke-al) tube has some advantages. (An endotracheal tube is a breathing tube inserted through the nose or mouth and into the windpipe.) Long-term use of an endotracheal tube can damage the trachea. This damage may need to be corrected with surgery later. A tracheostomy can allow your baby to interact more with you and the NICU staff, start talking, and develop other skills. While your baby is in the NICU, he or she also may need physical therapy. Physical therapy can help strengthen your child's muscles and clear mucus out of his or her lungs. Infants who have BPD may spend several weeks or months in the hospital. This allows them to get the care they need. Before your baby goes home, learn as much as you can about your child's condition and how it's treated. Your baby may continue to have some breathing symptoms after he or she leaves the hospital. Your child will likely continue on all or some of the treatments that were started at the hospital, including: Medicines, such as bronchodilators, steroids, and diuretics. Oxygen therapy or breathing support from NCPAP or a ventilator. Extra nutrition and calories, which may be given through a feeding tube. Preventive treatment with a medicine called palivizumab for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This common virus leads to mild, cold-like symptoms in adults and older, healthy children. However, in infantsespecially those in high-risk groupsRSV can lead to severe breathing problems. Your child also should have regular checkups with and timely vaccinations from a pediatrician. This is a doctor who specializes in treating children. If your child needs oxygen therapy or a ventilator at home, a pulmonary specialist might be involved in his or her care. Seek out support from family, friends, and hospital staff. Ask the case manager or social worker at the hospital about what you'll need after your baby leaves the hospital. The doctors and nurses can assist with questions about your infant's care. Also, you may want to ask whether your community has a support group for parents of premature infants."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia ?","completion":"Taking steps to ensure a healthy pregnancy might prevent your infant from being born before his or her lungs have fully developed.

If the RDS isn't mild, BPD will likely develop."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Cardiomyopathy ?","completion":"Cardiomyopathy refers to diseases of the heart muscle. These diseases have many causes, signs and symptoms, and treatments. In cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle becomes enlarged, thick, or rigid. In rare cases, the muscle tissue in the heart is replaced with scar tissue. As cardiomyopathy worsens, the heart becomes weaker. It's less able to pump blood through the body and maintain a normal electrical rhythm. This can lead to heart failure or irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias. In turn, heart failure can cause fluid to build up in the lungs, ankles, feet, legs, or abdomen. The weakening of the heart also can cause other complications, such as heart valve problems. Overview The types of cardiomyopathy are: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Dilated cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Unclassified cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathy can be acquired or inherited. \\"Acquired\\" means you aren't born with the disease, but you develop it due to another disease, condition, or factor. \\"Inherited\\" means your parents passed the gene for the disease on to you.

Acquired means you arent born with the disease, but you develop it due to another disease, condition, or factor. Inherited means your parents passed the gene for the disease on to you. Researchers continue to look for the genetic links to cardiomyopathy and to explore how these links cause or contribute to the various types of the disease. Many times, the cause of cardiomyopathy isnt known. This often is the case when the disease occurs in children. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually is inherited. Its caused by a mutation or change in some of the genes in heart muscle proteins. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy also can develop over time because of high blood pressure, aging, or other diseases, such as diabetes or thyroid disease. Sometimes the cause of the disease isnt known. Dilated Cardiomyopathy The cause of dilated cardiomyopathy often isnt known. About one-third of the people who have dilated cardiomyopathy inherit it from their parents.

The extra iron is toxic to the body and can damage the organs, including the heart. Sarcoidosis: A disease that causes inflammation and can affect various organs in the body. Researchers believe that an abnormal immune response may cause sarcoidosis. This abnormal response causes tiny lumps of cells to form in the bodys organs, including the heart.

(Heart murmurs are extra or unusual sounds heard during a heartbeat.)"},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Cardiomyopathy ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose cardiomyopathy based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures. Specialists Involved Often, a cardiologist or pediatric cardiologist diagnoses and treats cardiomyopathy. A cardiologist specializes in diagnosing and treating heart diseases. A pediatric cardiologist is a cardiologist who treats children. Medical and Family Histories Your doctor will want to learn about your medical history. He or she will want to know what signs and symptoms you have and how long you've had them. Your doctor also will want to know whether anyone in your family has had cardiomyopathy, heart failure, or sudden cardiac arrest. Physical Exam Your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen to your heart and lungs for sounds that may suggest cardiomyopathy. These sounds may even suggest a certain type of the disease. For example, the loudness, timing, and location of a heart murmur may suggest obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A \\"crackling\\" sound in the lungs may be a sign of heart failure. (Heart failure often develops in the later stages of cardiomyopathy.) Physical signs also help your doctor diagnose cardiomyopathy. Swelling of the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen, or veins in your neck suggests fluid buildup, a sign of heart failure. Your doctor may notice signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy during a routine exam. For example, he or she may hear a heart murmur, or you may have abnormal test results. Diagnostic Tests Your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to diagnose cardiomyopathy. Blood Tests During a blood test, a small amount of blood is taken from your body. It's often drawn from a vein in your arm using a needle. The procedure usually is quick and easy, although it may cause some short-term discomfort. Blood tests give your doctor information about your heart and help rule out other conditions. Chest X Ray A chest x ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test can show whether your heart is enlarged. A chest x ray also can show whether fluid is building up in your lungs. EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a simple test that records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart. This test is used to detect and study many heart problems, such as heart attacks, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), and heart failure. EKG results also can suggest other disorders that affect heart function. A standard EKG only records the heartbeat for a few seconds. It won't detect problems that don't happen during the test. To diagnose heart problems that come and go, your doctor may have you wear a portable EKG monitor. The two most common types of portable EKGs are Holter and event monitors. Holter and Event Monitors Holter and event monitors are small, portable devices. They record your heart's electrical activity while you do your normal daily activities. A Holter monitor records the heart's electrical activity for a full 24- or 48-hour period. An event monitor records your heart's electrical activity only at certain times while you're wearing it. For many event monitors, you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms. Other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms. Echocardiography Echocardiography (echo) is a test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The picture shows how well your heart is working and its size and shape. There are several types of echo, including stress echo. This test is done as part of a stress test (see below). Stress echo can show whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart, a sign of coronary heart disease. Another type of echo is transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo, or TEE. TEE provides a view of the back of the heart. For this test, a sound wave wand is put on the end of a special tube. The tube is gently passed down your throat and into your esophagus (the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach). Because this passage is right behind the heart, TEE can create detailed pictures of the heart's structures. Before TEE, you're given medicine to help you relax, and your throat is sprayed with numbing medicine. Stress Test Some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. During stress testing, you exercise (or are given medicine if you're unable to exercise) to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. These tests may include nuclear heart scanning, echo, and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning of the heart. Diagnostic Procedures You may have one or more medical procedures to confirm a diagnosis or to prepare for surgery (if surgery is planned). These procedures may include cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-i-ZA-shun), coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee), or myocardial (mi-o-KAR-de-al) biopsy. Cardiac Catheterization This procedure checks the pressure and blood flow in your heart's chambers. The procedure also allows your doctor to collect blood samples and look at your heart's arteries using x-ray imaging. During cardiac catheterization, a long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to your heart. This allows your doctor to study the inside of your arteries for blockages. Coronary Angiography This procedure often is done with cardiac catheterization. During the procedure, dye that can be seen on an x ray is injected into your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study blood flow through your heart and blood vessels. Dye also may be injected into your heart chambers. This allows your doctor to study the pumping function of your heart. Myocardial Biopsy For this procedure, your doctor removes a piece of your heart muscle. This can be done during cardiac catheterization. The heart muscle is studied under a microscope to see whether changes in cells have occurred. These changes may suggest cardiomyopathy. Myocardial biopsy is useful for diagnosing some types of cardiomyopathy. Genetic Testing Some types of cardiomyopathy run in families. Thus, your doctor may suggest genetic testing to look for the disease in your parents, brothers and sisters, or other family members. Genetic testing can show how the disease runs in families. It also can find out the chances of parents passing the genes for the disease on to their children. Genetic testing also may be useful if your doctor thinks you have cardiomyopathy, but you don't yet have signs or symptoms. If the test shows you have the disease, your doctor can start treatment early, when it may work best."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Cardiomyopathy ?","completion":"People who have cardiomyopathy but no signs or symptoms may not need treatment. Sometimes, dilated cardiomyopathy that comes on suddenly may go away on its own. For other people who have cardiomyopathy, treatment is needed. Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy you have, the severity of your symptoms and complications, and your age and overall health. Treatments may include: Heart-healthy lifestyle changes Medicines Nonsurgical procedure Surgery and implanted devices The main goals of treating cardiomyopathy include: Controlling signs and symptoms so that you can live as normally as possible Managing any conditions that cause or contribute to the disease Reducing complications and the risk of sudden cardiac arrest Stopping the disease from getting worse Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes Your doctor may suggest lifestyle changes to manage a condition thats causing your cardiomyopathy including: Heart-healthy eating Maintaining a healthy weight Managing stress Physical activity Quitting smoking Heart-Healthy Eating Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include: Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as fat-free milk Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating: A lot of red meat Palm and coconut oils Sugary foods and beverages Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise: Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats such as stick margarine;baked goods such as, cookies, cakes, and pies, crackers, frostings, and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats. Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples: Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are: Avocados Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils Peanut butter Salmon and trout Tofu Sodium Try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt. The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH. Alcohol Talk to your doctor about how much alcohol you drink. Too much alcohol canraise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Your doctor may recommend that you reduce the amount of alcohol you drinkor stop drinking alcohol. Maintaining a Healthy Weight Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active. Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) onlineBMI calculatoror talk to your doctor.A BMI: Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range. Between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. Of 30 or more is considered obese. A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal. Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visitAssessing Your Weight and Health Risk. If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol. Managing Stress Research shows that the most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting eventparticularly one involving anger. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy. Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health.Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as: A stress management program Meditation Physical activity Relaxation therapy Talking things out with friends or family Physical Activity Routine physical activity can lower many risk factors for coronary heart disease, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease. Everyone should try to participate in moderate intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous intensity aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats fasterand you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time spread throughout the week. Read more about physical activity at: Physical Activity and Your Heart U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines forAmericans Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. Quitting Smoking If you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Read more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart. Medicines Many medicines are used to treat cardiomyopathy. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to: Balance electrolytes in your body. Electrolytes are minerals that help maintain fluid levels and acid-base balance in the body. They also help muscle and nerve tissues work properly. Abnormal electrolyte levels may be a sign of dehydration (lack of fluid in your body), heart failure, high blood pressure, or other disorders. Aldosterone blockers are an example of a medicine used to balance electrolytes. Keep your heart beating with a normal rhythm. These medicines, called antiarrhythmics, help prevent arrhythmias. Lower your blood pressure. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers are examples of medicines that lower blood pressure. Prevent blood clots from forming. Anticoagulants, or blood thinners, are an example of a medicine that prevents blood clots. Blood thinners often are used to prevent blood clots from forming in people who have dilated cardiomyopathy. Reduce inflammation. Corticosteroids are an example of a medicine used to reduce inflammation. Remove excess sodium from your body. Diuretics, or water pills, are an example of medicines that help remove excess sodium from the body, which reduces the amount of fluid in your blood. Slow your heart rate. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin are examples of medicines that slow the heart rate. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers also are used to lower blood pressure. Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. Surgery and Implanted Devices Doctors use several types of surgery to treat cardiomyopathy, including septal myectomy, surgically implanted devices, and heart transplant. Septal Myectomy Septal myectomy is open-heart surgery and is used to treat people who have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe symptoms. This surgery generally is used for younger patients and for people whose medicines arent working well. A surgeon removes part of the thickened septum thats bulging into the left ventricle. This improves blood flow through the heart and out to the body. The removed tissue doesnt grow back. If needed, the surgeon also can repair or replace the mitral valve at the same time. Septal myectomy often is successful and allows you to return to a normal life with nosymptoms. Surgically Implanted Devices Surgeons can place several types of devices in the heart to improve function and symptoms, including: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device. A CRT device coordinates contractions between the hearts left and right ventricles. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator(ICD). An ICD helps control life-threatening arrhythmias that may lead tosudden cardiac arrest. This small device is implanted in the chest or abdomen and connected to the heart with wires. If an ICD senses a dangerous change in heart rhythm, it will send an electric shock to the heart to restore a normal heartbeat. Left ventricular assist device (LVAD). This device helps the heart pump blood to the body. An LVAD can be used as a long-term therapy or as a short-term treatment for people who are waiting for a heart transplant. Pacemaker. This small device is placed under the skin of your chest or abdomen to help control arrhythmias. The device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. Heart Transplant For this surgery, a surgeon replaces a persons diseased heart with a healthy heart from a deceased donor. A heart transplant is a last resort treatment for people who have end-stage heart failure. End-stage means the condition has become so severe that all treatments, other than heart transplant, have failed. For more information about this treatment, go to the Heart Transplant Health Topic. Nonsurgical Procedure Doctors may use a nonsurgical procedure called alcohol septal ablation to treat cardiomyopathy. During this procedure, the doctor injects ethanol (a type of alcohol) through a tube into the small artery that supplies blood to the thickened area of heart muscle. The alcohol kills cells, and the thickened tissue shrinks to a more normal size. This procedure allows blood to flow freely through the ventricle, which improves symptoms."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Cardiomyopathy ?","completion":"You can't prevent inherited types of cardiomyopathy. However, you can take steps to lower your risk for diseases or conditions that may lead to or complicate cardiomyopathy. Examples includecoronary heart disease,high blood pressure, andheart attack. Your doctor may advise you to make heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as: Avoiding the use of alcohol and illegal drugs Getting enough sleep and rest Heart-healthy eating Physicalactivity Quitting smoking Managing stress Your cardiomyopathy may be due to an underlying disease or condition. If you treat that condition early enough, you may be able to prevent cardiomyopathy complications. For example, to control high blood pressure,high blood cholesterol, and diabetes: Follow your doctors advice about lifestyle changes. Get regular checkups with your doctor. Take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Aplastic Anemia ?","completion":"Aplastic anemia (a-PLAS-tik uh-NEE-me-uh) is a blood disorder in which the body's bone marrow doesn't make enough new blood cells. Bone marrow is a sponge-like tissue inside the bones. It makes stem cells that develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (PLATE-lets). Red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of your body. They also carry carbon dioxide (a waste product) to your lungs to be exhaled. White blood cells help your body fight infections. Platelets are blood cell fragments that stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. It's normal for blood cells to die. The lifespan of red blood cells is about 120 days. White blood cells live less than a day. Platelets live about 6 days. As a result, your bone marrow must constantly make new blood cells. If your bone marrow can't make enough new blood cells, many health problems can occur. These problems include irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), an enlarged heart, heart failure, infections, and bleeding. Severe aplastic anemia can even cause death. Overview Aplastic anemia is a type of anemia. The term \\"anemia\\" usually refers to a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). This iron-rich protein helps carry oxygen to your body. In people who have aplastic anemia, the body doesn't make enough red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This is because the bone marrow's stem cells are damaged. (Aplastic anemia also is called bone marrow failure.) Many diseases, conditions, and factors can damage the stem cells. These conditions can be acquired or inherited. \\"Acquired\\" means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it. \\"Inherited\\" means your parents passed the gene for the condition on to you. In many people who have aplastic anemia, the cause is unknown. Outlook Aplastic anemia is a rare but serious disorder. It can develop suddenly or slowly. The disorder tends to get worse over time, unless its cause is found and treated. Treatments for aplastic anemia include blood transfusions, blood and marrow stem cell transplants, and medicines. With prompt and proper care, many people who have aplastic anemia can be successfully treated. Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may offer a cure for some people who have aplastic anemia."},{"prompt":"What causes Aplastic Anemia ?","completion":"Damage to the bone marrow's stem cells causes aplastic anemia. When stem cells are damaged, they don't grow into healthy blood cells. The cause of the damage can be acquired or inherited. \\"Acquired\\" means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it. \\"Inherited\\" means your parents passed the gene for the condition on to you. Acquired aplastic anemia is more common, and sometimes it's only temporary. Inherited aplastic anemia is rare. In many people who have aplastic anemia, the cause is unknown. Some research suggests that stem cell damage may occur because the body's immune system attacks its own cells by mistake. Acquired Causes Many diseases, conditions, and factors can cause aplastic anemia, including: Toxins, such as pesticides, arsenic, and benzene. Radiation and chemotherapy (treatments for cancer). Medicines, such as chloramphenicol (an antibiotic rarely used in the United States). Infectious diseases, such as hepatitis, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus (si-to-MEG-ah-lo-VI-rus), parvovirus B19, and HIV. Autoimmune disorders, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Pregnancy. (Aplastic anemia that occurs during pregnancy often goes away after delivery.) Sometimes, cancer from another part of the body can spread to the bone and cause aplastic anemia. Inherited Causes Certain inherited conditions can damage the stem cells and lead to aplastic anemia. Examples include Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, dyskeratosis (DIS-ker-ah-TO-sis) congenita, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Aplastic Anemia? ?","completion":"Aplastic anemia is a rare but serious blood disorder. People of all ages can develop aplastic anemia. However, it's most common in adolescents, young adults, and the elderly. Men and women are equally likely to have it. The disorder is two to three times more common in Asian countries. Your risk of aplastic anemia is higher if you: Have been exposed to toxins Have taken certain medicines or had radiation or chemotherapy (treatments for cancer) Have certain infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, or inherited conditions For more information, go to \\"What Causes Aplastic Anemia?\\""},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Aplastic Anemia ?","completion":"Lower than normal numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets cause most of the signs and symptoms of aplastic anemia. Signs and Symptoms of Low Blood Cell Counts Red Blood Cells The most common symptom of a low red blood cell count is fatigue (tiredness). A lack of hemoglobin in the blood causes fatigue. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It helps carry oxygen to the body. A low red blood cell count also can cause shortness of breath; dizziness, especially when standing up; headaches; coldness in your hands or feet; pale skin; and chest pain. If you don't have enough hemoglobin-carrying red blood cells, your heart has to work harder to move the reduced amount of oxygen in your blood. This can lead to arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), a heart murmur, an enlarged heart, or even heart failure. White Blood Cells White blood cells help fight infections. Signs and symptoms of a low white blood cell count include fevers, frequent infections that can be severe, and flu-like illnesses that linger. Platelets Platelets stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. People who have low platelet counts tend to bruise and bleed easily, and the bleeding may be hard to stop. Common types of bleeding associated with a low platelet count include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, pinpoint red spots on the skin, and blood in the stool. Women also may have heavy menstrual bleeding. Other Signs and Symptoms Aplastic anemia can cause signs and symptoms that aren't directly related to low blood cell counts. Examples include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and skin rashes. Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria Some people who have aplastic anemia have a condition called paroxysmal (par-ok-SIZ-mal) nocturnal hemoglobinuria (HE-mo-glo-bi-NOO-re-ah), or PNH. This is a red blood cell disorder. Most people who have PNH don't have any signs or symptoms. If symptoms do occur, they may include: Shortness of breath Swelling or pain in the abdomen or swelling in the legs caused by blood clots Blood in the urine Headaches Jaundice (a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes) In people who have aplastic anemia and PNH, either condition can develop first."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Aplastic Anemia ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose aplastic anemia based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. Once your doctor knows the cause and severity of the condition, he or she can create a treatment plan for you. Specialists Involved If your primary care doctor thinks you have aplastic anemia, he or she may refer you to a hematologist. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in treating blood diseases and disorders. Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask questions about your medical history, such as whether: You've had anemia or a condition that can cause anemia You have shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, or other signs and symptoms of anemia You've been exposed to certain toxins or medicines You've had radiation or chemotherapy (treatments for cancer) You've had infections or signs of infections, such as fever You bruise or bleed easily Your doctor also may ask whether any of your family members have had anemia or other blood disorders. Physical Exam Your doctor will do a physical exam to check for signs of aplastic anemia. He or she will try to find out how severe the disorder is and what's causing it. The exam may include checking for pale or yellowish skin and signs of bleeding or infection. Your doctor may listen to your heart and lungs for abnormal heartbeats and breathing sounds. He or she also may feel your abdomen to check the size of your liver and feel your legs for swelling. Diagnostic Tests Many tests are used to diagnose aplastic anemia. These tests help: Confirm a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, look for its cause, and find out how severe it is Rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms Check for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) Complete Blood Count Often, the first test used to diagnose aplastic anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures many parts of your blood. This test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It carries oxygen to the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia. The normal range of these levels varies in certain racial and ethnic populations. Your doctor can explain your test results to you. The CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Abnormal results may be a sign of aplastic anemia, an infection, or another condition. Finally, the CBC looks at mean corpuscular (kor-PUS-kyu-lar) volume (MCV). MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells. The results may be a clue as to the cause of your anemia. Reticulocyte Count A reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count measures the number of young red blood cells in your blood. The test shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate. People who have aplastic anemia have low reticulocyte levels. Bone Marrow Tests Bone marrow tests show whether your bone marrow is healthy and making enough blood cells. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pi-RA-shun) and biopsy. Bone marrow aspiration may be done to find out if and why your bone marrow isn't making enough blood cells. For this test, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow fluid through a needle. The sample is looked at under a microscope to check for faulty cells. A bone marrow biopsy may be done at the same time as an aspiration or afterward. For this test, your doctor removes a small amount of bone marrow tissue through a needle. The tissue is checked for the number and types of cells in the bone marrow. In aplastic anemia, the bone marrow has a lower than normal number of all three types of blood cells. Other Tests Other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of aplastic anemia. Thus, other tests may be needed to rule out those conditions. These tests may include: X ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or an ultrasound imaging test. These tests can show enlarged lymph nodes in your abdomen. Enlarged lymph nodes may be a sign of blood cancer. Doctors also may use these tests to look at the kidneys and the bones in the arms and hands, which are sometimes abnormal in young people who have Fanconi anemia. This type of anemia can lead to aplastic anemia. Chest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray may be used to rule out infections. Liver tests and viral studies. These tests are used to check for liver diseases and viruses. Tests that check vitamin B12 and folate levels in the blood. These tests can help rule out anemia caused by vitamin deficiency. Your doctor also may recommend blood tests for PNH and to check your immune system for proteins called antibodies. (Antibodies in the immune system that attack your bone marrow cells may cause aplastic anemia.)"},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Aplastic Anemia ?","completion":"Treatments for aplastic anemia include blood transfusions, blood and marrow stem cell transplants, and medicines. These treatments can prevent or limit complications, relieve symptoms, and improve quality of life. Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may cure the disorder in some people who are eligible for a transplant. Removing a known cause of aplastic anemia, such as exposure to a toxin, also may cure the condition. Who Needs Treatment People who have mild or moderate aplastic anemia may not need treatment as long as the condition doesn't get worse. People who have severe aplastic anemia need medical treatment right away to prevent complications. People who have very severe aplastic anemia need emergency medical care in a hospital. Very severe aplastic anemia can be fatal if it's not treated right away. Blood Transfusions Blood transfusions can help keep blood cell counts at acceptable levels. A blood transfusion is a common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels. Transfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood. Blood transfusions help relieve the symptoms of aplastic anemia, but they're not a permanent treatment. Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplants A blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces damaged stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor). During the transplant, which is like a blood transfusion, you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein in your chest. Once the stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells. Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may cure aplastic anemia in people who can have this type of treatment. The transplant works best in children and young adults with severe aplastic anemia who are in good health and who have matched donors. Older people may be less able to handle the treatments needed to prepare the body for the transplant. They're also more likely to have complications after the transplant. If you have aplastic anemia, talk with your doctor about whether a blood and marrow stem cell transplant is an option for you. Medicines If you have aplastic anemia, your doctor may prescribe medicines to: Stimulate your bone marrow Suppress your immune system Prevent and treat infections Medicines To Stimulate Bone Marrow Man-made versions of substances that occur naturally in the body can stimulate the bone marrow to make more blood cells. Examples of these types of medicines include erythropoietin and colony-stimulating factors. These medicines have some risks. You and your doctor will work together to decide whether the benefits of these medicines outweigh the risks. If this treatment works well, it can help you avoid the need for blood transfusions. Medicines To Suppress the Immune System Research suggests that aplastic anemia may sometimes occur because the body's immune system attacks its own cells by mistake. For this reason, your doctor may prescribe medicines to suppress your immune system. These medicines allow your bone marrow to start making blood cells again. They also may help you avoid the need for blood transfusions. Medicines that suppress the immune system don't cure aplastic anemia. However, they can relieve its symptoms and reduce complications. These medicines often are used for people who can't have blood and marrow stem cell transplants or who are waiting for transplants. Three medicinesoften given togethercan suppress the body's immune system. They are antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporine, and methylprednisolone. It may take a few months to notice the effects of these medicines. Most often, as blood cell counts rise, symptoms lessen. Blood cell counts in people who respond well to these medicines usually don't reach normal levels. However, the blood cell counts often are high enough to allow people to do their normal activities. People who have aplastic anemia may need long-term treatment with these medicines. Medicines that suppress the immune system can have side effects. They also may increase the risk of developing leukemia (lu-KE-me-ah) or myelodysplasia (MI-e-lo-dis-PLA-ze-ah; MDS). Leukemia is a cancer of the blood cells. MDS is a condition in which the bone marrow makes too many faulty blood cells. Medicines To Prevent and Treat Infections If you have aplastic anemia, you might be at risk for infections due to low white blood cell counts. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotic and antiviral medicines to prevent and treat infections."},{"prompt":"What is (are) IronDeficiency Anemia ?","completion":"Espaol Iron-deficiency anemia is a common, easily treated condition that occurs if you don't have enough iron in your body. Low iron levels usually are due to blood loss, poor diet, or an inability to absorb enough iron from food. Overview Iron-deficiency anemia is a common type of anemia. The term \\"anemia\\" usually refers to a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen and remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Iron-deficiency anemia usually develops over time if your body doesn't have enough iron to build healthy red blood cells. Without enough iron, your body starts using the iron it has stored. Soon, the stored iron gets used up. After the stored iron is gone, your body makes fewer red blood cells. The red blood cells it does make have less hemoglobin than normal. Iron-deficiency anemia can cause fatigue (tiredness), shortness of breath, chest pain, and other symptoms. Severe iron-deficiency anemia can lead to heart problems, infections, problems with growth and development in children, and other complications. Infants and young children and women are the two groups at highest risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Outlook Doctors usually can successfully treat iron-deficiency anemia. Treatment will depend on the cause and severity of the condition. Treatments may include dietary changes, medicines, and surgery. Severe iron-deficiency anemia may require treatment in a hospital, blood transfusions, iron injections, or intravenous iron therapy."},{"prompt":"What causes IronDeficiency Anemia ?","completion":"Not having enough iron in your body causes iron-deficiency anemia. Lack of iron usually is due to blood loss, poor diet, or an inability to absorb enough iron from food. Blood Loss When you lose blood, you lose iron. If you don't have enough iron stored in your body to make up for the lost iron, you'll develop iron-deficiency anemia. In women, long or heavy menstrual periods or bleeding fibroids in the uterus may cause low iron levels. Blood loss that occurs during childbirth is another cause of low iron levels in women. Internal bleeding (bleeding inside the body) also may lead to iron-deficiency anemia. This type of blood loss isn't always obvious, and it may occur slowly. Some causes of internal bleeding are: A bleeding ulcer, colon polyp, or colon cancer Regular use of aspirin or other pain medicines, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (for example, ibuprofen and naproxen) Urinary tract bleeding Blood loss from severe injuries, surgery, or frequent blood drawings also can cause iron-deficiency anemia. Poor Diet The best sources of iron are meat, poultry, fish, and iron-fortified foods (foods that have iron added). If you don't eat these foods regularly, or if you don't take an iron supplement, you're more likely to develop iron-deficiency anemia. Vegetarian diets can provide enough iron if you eat the right foods. For example, good nonmeat sources of iron include iron-fortified breads and cereals, beans, tofu, dried fruits, and spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables. During some stages of life, such as pregnancy and childhood, it may be hard to get enough iron in your diet. This is because your need for iron increases during these times of growth and development. Inability To Absorb Enough Iron Even if you have enough iron in your diet, your body may not be able to absorb it. This can happen if you have intestinal surgery (such as gastric bypass) or a disease of the intestine (such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease). Prescription medicines that reduce acid in the stomach also can interfere with iron absorption."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for IronDeficiency Anemia? ?","completion":"Infants and Young Children Infants and young children need a lot of iron to grow and develop. The iron that full-term infants have stored in their bodies is used up in the first 4 to 6 months of life. Premature and low-birth-weight babies (weighing less than 5.5 pounds) are at even greater risk for iron-deficiency anemia. These babies don't have as much iron stored in their bodies as larger, full-term infants. Iron-fortified baby food or iron supplements, when used properly, can help prevent iron-deficiency anemia in infants and young children. Talk with your child's doctor about your child's diet. Young children who drink a lot of cow's milk may be at risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Milk is low in iron, and too much milk may take the place of iron-rich foods in the diet. Too much milk also may prevent children's bodies from absorbing iron from other foods. Children who have lead in their blood also may be at risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Lead can interfere with the body's ability to make hemoglobin. Lead may get into the body from breathing in lead dust, eating lead in paint or soil, or drinking water that contains lead. Teens Teens are at risk for iron-deficiency anemia if they're underweight or have chronic (ongoing) illnesses. Teenage girls who have heavy periods also are at increased risk for the condition. Women Women of childbearing age are at higher risk for iron-deficiency anemia because of blood loss during their monthly periods. About 1 in 5 women of childbearing age has iron-deficiency anemia. Pregnant women also are at higher risk for the condition because they need twice as much iron as usual. The extra iron is needed for increased blood volume and for the fetus' growth. About half of all pregnant women develop iron-deficiency anemia. The condition can increase a pregnant woman's risk for a premature or low-birth-weight baby. Adults Who Have Internal Bleeding Adults who have internal bleeding, such as intestinal bleeding, can develop iron-deficiency anemia due to blood loss. Certain conditions, such as colon cancer and bleeding ulcers, can cause blood loss. Some medicines, such as aspirin, also can cause internal bleeding. Other At-Risk Groups People who get kidney dialysis treatment may develop iron-deficiency anemia. This is because blood is lost during dialysis. Also, the kidneys are no longer able to make enough of a hormone that the body needs to produce red blood cells. People who have gastric bypass surgery also may develop iron-deficiency anemia. This type of surgery can prevent the body from absorbing enough iron. Certain eating patterns or habits may put you at higher risk for iron-deficiency anemia. This can happen if you: Follow a diet that excludes meat and fish, which are the best sources of iron. However, vegetarian diets can provide enough iron if you eat the right foods. For example, good nonmeat sources of iron include iron-fortified breads and cereals, beans, tofu, dried fruits, and spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables. Eat poorly because of money, social, health, or other problems. Follow a very low-fat diet over a long time. Some higher fat foods, like meat, are the best sources of iron. Follow a high-fiber diet. Large amounts of fiber can slow the absorption of iron."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of IronDeficiency Anemia ?","completion":"The signs and symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia depend on its severity. Mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia may have no signs or symptoms. When signs and symptoms do occur, they can range from mild to severe. Many of the signs and symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia apply to all types of anemia. Signs and Symptoms of Anemia The most common symptom of all types of anemia is fatigue (tiredness). Fatigue occurs because your body doesn't have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to its many parts. Also, the red blood cells your body makes have less hemoglobin than normal. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells. It helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Anemia also can cause shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, coldness in your hands and feet, pale skin, chest pain, weakness, and fatigue (tiredness). If you don't have enough hemoglobin-carrying red blood cells, your heart has to work harder to move oxygen-rich blood through your body. This can lead to irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), a heart murmur, an enlarged heart, or even heart failure. In infants and young children, signs of anemia include poor appetite, slowed growth and development, and behavioral problems. Signs and Symptoms of Iron Deficiency Signs and symptoms of iron deficiency may include brittle nails, swelling or soreness of the tongue, cracks in the sides of the mouth, an enlarged spleen, and frequent infections. People who have iron-deficiency anemia may have an unusual craving for nonfood items, such as ice, dirt, paint, or starch. This craving is called pica (PI-ka or PE-ka). Some people who have iron-deficiency anemia develop restless legs syndrome (RLS). RLS is a disorder that causes a strong urge to move the legs. This urge to move often occurs with strange and unpleasant feelings in the legs. People who have RLS often have a hard time sleeping. Iron-deficiency anemia can put children at greater risk for lead poisoning and infections. Some signs and symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia are related to the condition's causes. For example, a sign of intestinal bleeding is bright red blood in the stools or black, tarry-looking stools. Very heavy menstrual bleeding, long periods, or other vaginal bleeding may suggest that a woman is at risk for iron-deficiency anemia."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose IronDeficiency Anemia ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose iron-deficiency anemia based on your medical history, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures. Once your doctor knows the cause and severity of the condition, he or she can create a treatment plan for you. Mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia may have no signs or symptoms. Thus, you may not know you have it unless your doctor discovers it from a screening test or while checking for other problems. Specialists Involved Primary care doctors often diagnose and treat iron-deficiency anemia. These doctors include pediatricians, family doctors, gynecologists/obstetricians, and internal medicine specialists. A hematologist (a blood disease specialist), a gastroenterologist (a digestive system specialist), and other specialists also may help treat iron-deficiency anemia. Medical History Your doctor will ask about your signs and symptoms and any past problems you've had with anemia or low iron. He or she also may ask about your diet and whether you're taking any medicines. If you're a woman, your doctor may ask whether you might be pregnant. Physical Exam Your doctor will do a physical exam to look for signs of iron-deficiency anemia. He or she may: Look at your skin, gums, and nail beds to see whether they're pale Listen to your heart for rapid or irregular heartbeats Listen to your lungs for rapid or uneven breathing Feel your abdomen to check the size of your liver and spleen Do a pelvic and rectal exam to check for internal bleeding Diagnostic Tests and Procedures Many tests and procedures are used to diagnose iron-deficiency anemia. They can help confirm a diagnosis, look for a cause, and find out how severe the condition is. Complete Blood Count Often, the first test used to diagnose anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures many parts of your blood. This test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia. The normal range of these levels varies in certain racial and ethnic populations. Your doctor can explain your test results to you. The CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Abnormal results may be a sign of infection, a blood disorder, or another condition. Finally, the CBC looks at mean corpuscular (kor-PUS-kyu-lar) volume (MCV). MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells. The results may be a clue as to the cause of your anemia. In iron-deficiency anemia, for example, red blood cells usually are smaller than normal. Other Blood Tests If the CBC results confirm you have anemia, you may need other blood tests to find out what's causing the condition, how severe it is, and the best way to treat it. Reticulocyte count. This test measures the number of reticulocytes (re-TIK-u-lo-sites) in your blood. Reticulocytes are young, immature red blood cells. Over time, reticulocytes become mature red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout your body. A reticulocyte count shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate. Peripheral smear. For this test, a sample of your blood is examined under a microscope. If you have iron-deficiency anemia, your red blood cells will look smaller and paler than normal. Tests to measure iron levels. These tests can show how much iron has been used from your body's stored iron. Tests to measure iron levels include: Serum iron. This test measures the amount of iron in your blood. The level of iron in your blood may be normal even if the total amount of iron in your body is low. For this reason, other iron tests also are done. Serum ferritin. Ferritin is a protein that helps store iron in your body. A measure of this protein helps your doctor find out how much of your body's stored iron has been used. Transferrin level, or total iron-binding capacity. Transferrin is a protein that carries iron in your blood. Total iron-binding capacity measures how much of the transferrin in your blood isn't carrying iron. If you have iron-deficiency anemia, you'll have a high level of transferrin that has no iron. Other tests. Your doctor also may recommend tests to check your hormone levels, especially your thyroid hormone. You also may have a blood test for a chemical called erythrocyte protoporphyrin. This chemical is a building block for hemoglobin. Children also may be tested for the level of lead in their blood. Lead can make it hard for the body to produce hemoglobin. Tests and Procedures for Gastrointestinal Blood Loss To check whether internal bleeding is causing your iron-deficiency anemia, your doctor may suggest a fecal occult blood test. This test looks for blood in the stools and can detect bleeding in the intestines. If the test finds blood, you may have other tests and procedures to find the exact spot of the bleeding. These tests and procedures may look for bleeding in the stomach, upper intestines, colon, or pelvic organs."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for IronDeficiency Anemia ?","completion":"Treatment for iron-deficiency anemia will depend on its cause and severity. Treatments may include dietary changes and supplements, medicines, and surgery. Severe iron-deficiency anemia may require a blood transfusion, iron injections, or intravenous (IV) iron therapy. Treatment may need to be done in a hospital. The goals of treating iron-deficiency anemia are to treat its underlying cause and restore normal levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin, and iron. Dietary Changes and Supplements Iron You may need iron supplements to build up your iron levels as quickly as possible. Iron supplements can correct low iron levels within months. Supplements come in pill form or in drops for children. Large amounts of iron can be harmful, so take iron supplements only as your doctor prescribes. Keep iron supplements out of reach from children. This will prevent them from taking an overdose of iron. Iron supplements can cause side effects, such as dark stools, stomach irritation, and heartburn. Iron also can cause constipation, so your doctor may suggest that you use a stool softener. Your doctor may advise you to eat more foods that are rich in iron. The best source of iron is red meat, especially beef and liver. Chicken, turkey, pork, fish, and shellfish also are good sources of iron. The body tends to absorb iron from meat better than iron from nonmeat foods. However, some nonmeat foods also can help you raise your iron levels. Examples of nonmeat foods that are good sources of iron include: Iron-fortified breads and cereals Peas; lentils; white, red, and baked beans; soybeans; and chickpeas Tofu Dried fruits, such as prunes, raisins, and apricots Spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables Prune juice The Nutrition Facts labels on packaged foods will show how much iron the items contain. The amount is given as a percentage of the total amount of iron you need every day. Vitamin C Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron. Good sources of vitamin C are vegetables and fruits, especially citrus fruits. Citrus fruits include oranges, grapefruits, tangerines, and similar fruits. Fresh and frozen fruits, vegetables, and juices usually have more vitamin C than canned ones. If you're taking medicines, ask your doctor or pharmacist whether you can eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice. Grapefruit can affect the strength of a few medicines and how well they work. Other fruits rich in vitamin C include kiwi fruit, strawberries, and cantaloupes. Vegetables rich in vitamin C include broccoli, peppers, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, cabbage, potatoes, and leafy green vegetables like turnip greens and spinach. Treatment To Stop Bleeding If blood loss is causing iron-deficiency anemia, treatment will depend on the cause of the bleeding. For example, if you have a bleeding ulcer, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics and other medicines to treat the ulcer. If a polyp or cancerous tumor in your intestine is causing bleeding, you may need surgery to remove the growth. If you have heavy menstrual flow, your doctor may prescribe birth control pills to help reduce your monthly blood flow. In some cases, surgery may be advised. Treatments for Severe Iron-Deficiency Anemia Blood Transfusion If your iron-deficiency anemia is severe, you may get a transfusion of red blood cells. A blood transfusion is a safe, common procedure in which blood is given to you through an IV line in one of your blood vessels. A transfusion requires careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood. A transfusion of red blood cells will treat your anemia right away. The red blood cells also give a source of iron that your body can reuse. However, a blood transfusion is only a short-term treatment. Your doctor will need to find and treat the cause of your anemia. Blood transfusions are usually reserved for people whose anemia puts them at a higher risk for heart problems or other severe health issues. For more information, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article. Iron Therapy If you have severe anemia, your doctor may recommend iron therapy. For this treatment, iron is injected into a muscle or an IV line in one of your blood vessels. IV iron therapy presents some safety concerns. It must be done in a hospital or clinic by experienced staff. Iron therapy usually is given to people who need iron long-term but can't take iron supplements by mouth. This therapy also is given to people who need immediate treatment for iron-deficiency anemia."},{"prompt":"w to prevent IronDeficiency Anemia ?","completion":"Eating a well-balanced diet that includes iron-rich foods may help you prevent iron-deficiency anemia. Taking iron supplements also may lower your risk for the condition if you're not able to get enough iron from food. Large amounts of iron can be harmful, so take iron supplements only as your doctor prescribes. For more information about diet and supplements, go to \\"How Is Iron-Deficiency Anemia Treated?\\" Infants and young children and women are the two groups at highest risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Special measures can help prevent the condition in these groups. Infants and Young Children A baby's diet can affect his or her risk for iron-deficiency anemia. For example, cow's milk is low in iron. For this and other reasons, cow's milk isn't recommended for babies in their first year. After the first year, you may need to limit the amount of cow's milk your baby drinks. Also, babies need more iron as they grow and begin to eat solid foods. Talk with your child's doctor about a healthy diet and food choices that will help your child get enough iron. Your child's doctor may recommend iron drops. However, giving a child too much iron can be harmful. Follow the doctor's instructions and keep iron supplements and vitamins away from children. Asking for child-proof packages for supplements can help prevent overdosing in children. Because recent research supports concerns that iron deficiency during infancy and childhood can have long-lasting, negative effects on brain health, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends testing all infants for anemia at 1 year of age. Women and Girls Women of childbearing age may be tested for iron-deficiency anemia, especially if they have: A history of iron-deficiency anemia Heavy blood loss during their monthly periods Other risk factors for iron-deficiency anemia The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed guidelines for who should be screened for iron deficiency, and how often: Girls aged 12 to 18 and women of childbearing age who are not pregnant: Every 5 to 10 years. Women who have risk factors for iron deficiency: Once a year. Pregnant women: At the first prenatal visit. For pregnant women, medical care during pregnancy usually includes screening for anemia. Also, your doctor may prescribe iron supplements or advise you to eat more iron-rich foods.This not only will help you avoid iron-deficiency anemia, but also may lower your risk of having a low-birth-weight baby."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},I={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},H=["disabled"],L={key:0},N={key:1};function M(i,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",I,[(a(!0),o(w,null,x(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",E,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
