P(X ≥ 50) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 50 to 200 Calculating this sum directly can be computationally intensive. Instead, we can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring: P(X ≥ 50) = 1 - P(X < 50) Now we only need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 0, 1, ..., 49: P(X < 50) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 49 Using a cumulative binomial probability table or a statistical software, we can find the value of P(X < 50). Alternatively, you can use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, which is particularly useful for large values of n.

This means we need to find the probability for 8, 9, and 10 consumers preferring eco-friendly packaging and then add those probabilities together. First, let's find the probability of each individual case: 1. Probability of 8 consumers preferring eco-friendly packaging: n = 10, k = 8, p = 0.7 P(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * (0.7)^8 * (1-0.7)^(10-8) P(X = 8) = 45 * (0.7)^8 * (0.3)^2 2. Probability of 9 consumers preferring eco-friendly packaging: n = 10, k = 9, p = 0.7 P(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * (0.7)^9 * (1-0.7)^(10-9) P(X = 9) = 10 * (0.7)^9 * (0.3)^1 3.

Let X be the number of males who buy the product and Y be the number of females who buy the product. We want to find the probability P(X + Y >= 40). There are 50 males and 50 females in the market. We can calculate the probability of at least 40 customers buying the product by considering all possible combinations of males and females that satisfy the condition X + Y >= 40. We can start by calculating the probability of exactly 40 customers buying the product, then 41, 42, ..., up to 100 customers. Finally, we will sum up these probabilities to get the overall probability. The binomial probability formula is: P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k) where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success, and n is the total number of trials. For males, n = 50, p = 0.4 For females, n = 50, p = 0.6 We will use the formula for each combination of X and Y that satisfies X + Y >= 40 and sum up the probabilities.

Where λ (lambda) is the average number of successes (encountering road construction) in the given interval (500 kilometers), e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), and k! is the factorial of k. First, we need to find λ. Since we don't have a specific number of sections, we can assume that λ is the expected number of road constructions encountered in 500 kilometers. We can estimate this by multiplying the total distance (500 km) by the probability of encountering road construction (0.3): λ = 500 * 0.3 = 150 Now, we can find the probabilities of encountering road construction 0 or 1 times using the Poisson distribution formula: P(X=0) = (150^0 * e^(-150)) / 0! = e^(-150) P(X=1) = (150^1 * e^(-150)) / 1! = 150 * e^(-150) Now, we can find the complementary probability: P(X≥2) = 1 - P(X=0) - P(X=1) = 1 - e^(-150) - 150 * e^(-150) ≈ 1 The probability of encountering road construction at least twice during the entire trip is approximately 1, or almost certain. This is because the expected number of road constructions encountered (150) is much larger than 2, making it very likely that the student will encounter road construction at least twice."},{"prompt":"A student is planning a road trip from New York to Los Angeles, which will have a total of 10 stops.

Plugging in the values: P(2) = (10C2) * (0.05^2) * (0.95^8) First, we calculate 10C2: 10C2 = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = 10! / (2! * 8!) = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1) = 45 Now, we calculate the probabilities: (0.05^2) = 0.0025 (0.95^8) = 0.6634 (rounded to 4 decimal places) Now, we plug these values back into the formula: P(2) = 45 * 0.0025 * 0.6634 P(2) ≈ 0.0746 So, the probability that the car will break down exactly twice during the entire trip is approximately 0.0746 or 7.46%."},{"prompt":"Suppose there are 25 people planning to take a road trip together.

Each car can accommodate a maximum of 4 people including the driver. If the friends decide to divide themselves equally among the cars, what is the probability that at least one car will have only girls since there are 3 girls and 3 boys in the group?","completion":"To find the probability that at least one car will have only girls, we can first find the total number of ways to divide the 6 friends into 3 cars and then find the number of ways to divide them such that at least one car has only girls. Total number of ways to divide 6 friends into 3 cars with 2 people in each car: We can use the multinomial coefficient formula for this: (6!)/(2! * 2! * 2!) = 720 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90 ways Now, let's find the number of ways to divide them such that at least one car has only girls: Case 1: One car has only girls, and the other two cars have a mix of boys and girls. There are 3 ways to choose which car will have only girls. Then, there are 3! ways to arrange the girls in that car. For the remaining 3 boys and 1 girl, there are 4! ways to arrange them in the other two cars. However, we need to divide by 2! for each car since the order of the people within the cars doesn't matter. Number of ways for Case 1: 3 * (3!) * (4!) / (2! * 2!) = 3 * 6 * 24 / (2 * 2) = 108 Case 2: Two cars have only girls, and the third car has only boys. There are 3 ways to choose which car will have only boys. Then, there are 3! ways to arrange the boys in that car. For the remaining 3 girls, there are 3! ways to arrange them in the other two cars. However, we need to divide by 2! for each car since the order of the people within the cars doesn't matter. Number of ways for Case 2: 3 * (3!) * (3!) / (2! * 2!) = 3 * 6 * 6 / (2 * 2) = 27 Total number of ways with at least one car having only girls: 108 + 27 = 135 Now, we can find the probability: Probability = (Number of ways with at least one car having only girls) / (Total number of ways to divide 6 friends into 3 cars) Probability = 135 / 90 = 1.5 However, since the probability cannot be greater than 1, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's reevaluate the problem. When we calculated the number of ways for Case 1, we overcounted the arrangements. We need to account for the fact that there are 2 boys and 1 girl left to be distributed among the two remaining cars. There are 3 ways to choose which car the remaining girl will go in, and then there are 2! ways to arrange the boys in the other car. So, the corrected number of ways for Case 1: 3 * (3!) * 3 * (2!) = 3 * 6 * 3 * 2 = 108 Now, the total number of ways with at least one car having only girls is: 108 + 27 = 135 The corrected probability is: Probability = 135 / 90 = 3 / 2 = 1.5 Again, we have a probability greater than 1, which is not possible. We made another mistake in our calculations. Let's reevaluate the problem once more. We should consider the combinations instead of permutations for arranging the friends in the cars, as the order within the cars doesn't matter. Total number of ways to divide 6 friends into 3 cars with 2 people in each car: We can use the combinations formula for this: C(6,2) * C(4,2) = (6!/(2! * 4!)) * (4!/(2! * 2!)) = 15 * 6 = 90 ways Now, let's find the number of ways to divide them such that at least one car has only girls: Case 1: One car has only girls, and the other two cars have a mix of boys and girls. There are 3 ways to choose which car will have only girls. Then, there are C(3,2) ways to choose 2 girls out of 3 to be in that car. For the remaining 3 boys and 1 girl, there are C(4,2) ways to choose 2 people for one of the remaining cars. Number of ways for Case 1: 3 * C(3,2) * C(4,2) = 3 * 3 * 6 = 54 Case 2: Two cars have only girls, and the third car has only boys. There are 3 ways to choose which car will have only boys. Then, there are C(3,2) ways to choose 2 girls out of 3 to be in one of the girl-only cars. The remaining girl will be in the other girl-only car. Number of ways for Case 2: 3 * C(3,2) = 3 * 3 = 9 Total number of ways with at least one car having only girls: 54 + 9 = 63 Now, we can find the probability: Probability = (Number of ways with at least one car having only girls) / (Total number of ways to divide 6 friends into 3 cars) Probability = 63 / 90 = 7 / 10 = 0.7 So, the probability that at least one car will have only girls is 0.7 or 70%."},{"prompt":"Suppose that on a family trip, the probability of a car breaking down is 0.15 and the probability of encountering heavy traffic is 0.35.

We are given P(A) = 0.15 and P(B) = 0.35. However, we don't have the probability of both events happening simultaneously, P(A ∩ B). If we assume that the events are independent (meaning the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other), then we can calculate P(A ∩ B) as follows: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.15 * 0.35 = 0.0525 Now, we can find the probability of encountering heavy traffic or the car breaking down: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.15 + 0.35 - 0.0525 = 0.4475 So, the probability that the family encounters heavy traffic or their car breaks down is 0.4475 or 44.75%."},{"prompt":"A family is planning a road trip and wants to know the probability of encountering at least one construction zone on their 8-hour journey.

The complementary probability of experiencing at least one flat tire is the probability of not experiencing any flat tires during the entire trip. The probability of not experiencing a flat tire on any given mile is 1 - 0.002 = 0.998. For the entire 500-mile trip, the probability of not experiencing any flat tires is (0.998)^500, since the events are independent. Now, we can calculate this value: (0.998)^500 ≈ 0.367.

The binomial probability formula is: P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k) where: - P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rain) in n trials (activities) - C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k) - p is the probability of success (rain) in a single trial (activity) - n is the number of trials (activities) - k is the number of successes (rain) we want to find the probability for In this case, we have: - n = 5 (number of activities) - p = 0.4 (40% chance of rain) We want to find the probability that it will rain during at least 2 of the activities, so we need to find the probability for k = 2, 3, 4, and 5, and then sum these probabilities. P(X >= 2) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) Calculating each probability using the binomial probability formula: P(X = 2) = C(5, 2) * 0.4^2 * 0.6^3 = 10 * 0.16 * 0.216 = 0.3456 P(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * 0.4^3 * 0.6^2 = 10 * 0.064 * 0.36 = 0.2304 P(X = 4) = C(5, 4) * 0.4^4 * 0.6^1 = 5 * 0.0256 * 0.6 = 0.0768 P(X = 5) = C(5, 5) * 0.4^5 * 0.6^0 = 1 * 0.01024 * 1 = 0.01024 Now, summing these probabilities: P(X >= 2) = 0.3456 + 0.2304 + 0.0768 + 0.01024 = 0.66304 So, there is a 66.304% chance that it will rain during at least 2 of the 5 activities."},{"prompt":"Suppose that on a certain trip, there is a 60% chance of having sunny weather, and a 25% chance of encountering traffic.

According to the weather forecast, the probability of having at least one rainy day during her trip is 0.4. If her trip lasts for 7 days, what is the probability that she will have at least one day of rain during her trip?","completion":"To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability of having at least one rainy day is the probability of having no rainy days at all. Let P(rain) = 0.4, which means the probability of having rain on any given day is 0.4. Therefore, the probability of not having rain on any given day, P(no rain), is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Since the trip lasts for 7 days, the probability of having no rainy days at all during the trip is the product of the probabilities of not having rain on each day: P(no rain for 7 days) = P(no rain)^7 = (0.6)^7 ≈ 0.02799. Now, to find the probability of having at least one rainy day during the trip, we can use the complementary probability: P(at least one rainy day) = 1 - P(no rain for 7 days) = 1 - 0.02799 ≈ 0.97201.

Now, we can find the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes: Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 12/20 To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4: 12 ÷ 4 = 3 20 ÷ 4 = 5 So, the probability of selecting a rock band or a DJ is 3/5 or 0.6 (60%)."},{"prompt":"During a dance performance, there are 5 salsa dancers, 3 hip hop dancers, and 2 ballroom dancers. If a spectator randomly chooses one dancer to be their favorite, what is the probability that the chosen dancer is a ballroom dancer?","completion":"There are a total of 5 salsa dancers + 3 hip hop dancers + 2 ballroom dancers = 10 dancers in the performance. The probability of choosing a ballroom dancer as a favorite is the number of ballroom dancers divided by the total number of dancers. So, the probability is 2 ballroom dancers / 10 total dancers = 1/5 or 0.2. Therefore, the probability that the chosen dancer is a ballroom dancer is 1/5 or 20%."},{"prompt":"A magician performs a trick where they shuffle a deck of cards and then correctly guess the color of the top card.

Since the performance is 5 minutes long, each move will be performed for (1/10) * 5 = 1/2 minute. Now, we need to find the probability of the dancer performing a specific type of dance move during the 5-minute performance. Since each move is performed for an equal amount of time, the probability of performing any specific move at any given time is 1/10. Therefore, the probability of the dancer performing a specific type of dance move during the 5-minute performance is 1/10 or 10%."},{"prompt":"A theater performance has a total of 50 seats. The probability of each seat being occupied is 0.6. What is the probability that at least 30 seats will be occupied during the performance?","completion":"To find the probability that at least 30 seats will be occupied, we can use the binomial probability formula and sum the probabilities from 30 to 50 seats being occupied. The binomial probability formula is: P(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k) where n is the total number of seats (50), k is the number of occupied seats, p is the probability of a seat being occupied (0.6), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. We want to find the probability of at least 30 seats being occupied, so we need to sum the probabilities for k = 30 to k = 50: P(X ≥ 30) = Σ P(X=k) for k = 30 to 50 Calculating each term and summing them up, we get: P(X ≥ 30) ≈ 0.996 So, the probability that at least 30 seats will be occupied during the performance is approximately 0.996 or 99.6%."},{"prompt":"What is the probability that a magician will correctly guess the suit of a randomly chosen card from a standard deck of 52 cards, if he is given only one guess?","completion":"There are 4 suits in a standard deck of 52 cards: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards. If the magician has only one guess, he can choose one of the 4 suits. The probability that he will guess the correct suit is the number of successful outcomes (choosing the correct suit) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (all 4 suits). Probability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) Probability = 1 (correct suit) / 4 (total suits) Probability = 1/4 or 0.25 So, the probability that the magician will correctly guess the suit of a randomly chosen card from a standard deck of 52 cards with only one guess is 1/4 or 0.25 (25%)."},{"prompt":"Suppose there are 12 performers in a show, and each performer has a probability of 0.6 of hitting their cue correctly.

So, there are C(5,2) = 10 possible combinations of cards that the magician can select, where C(n,k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items. Now, we need to find the combinations that include card number 3 and another odd-numbered card. The other odd-numbered cards are 1 and 5. So, there are 2 possible combinations that meet the criteria: {1, 3} and {3, 5}. Therefore, the probability that the magician selects card number 3 and another odd-numbered card is the number of successful outcomes (2) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (10): Probability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 2 / 10 = 1 / 5 = 0.2 or 20%."},{"prompt":"a magic show, a magician has a pack of 52 cards, out of which 4 cards are Ace of Hearts.

However, since there is no overlap between heart cards and spade cards, we don't need to worry about subtracting any overlapping probabilities. So, the probability of selecting either a heart card or a spade card is: P(Heart or Spade) = P(Heart) + P(Spade) = 1/4 + 1/5 To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 20. So, we have: P(Heart or Spade) = 5/20 + 4/20 = 9/20 Therefore, the probability of the magician selecting either a heart card or a spade card from the deck is 9/20."},{"prompt":"A magician has 8 red balls, 5 green balls, and 7 blue balls.

P(X ≥ 7) = P(X = 7) + P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10) Let's calculate each probability: P(X = 7) = C(10, 7) * 0.7^7 * 0.3^3 P(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * 0.7^8 * 0.3^2 P(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * 0.7^9 * 0.3^1 P(X = 10) = C(10, 10) * 0.7^10 * 0.3^0 Calculating the combinations: C(10, 7) = 10! / (7!3!) = 120 C(10, 8) = 10! / (8!2!) = 45 C(10, 9) = 10! / (9!1!) = 10 C(10, 10) = 10! / (10!0!) = 1 Now, let's calculate the probabilities: P(X = 7) = 120 * 0.7^7 * 0.3^3 ≈ 0.2668 P(X = 8) = 45 * 0.7^8 * 0.3^2 ≈ 0.2335 P(X = 9) = 10 * 0.7^9 * 0.3^1 ≈ 0.1211 P(X = 10) = 1 * 0.7^10 * 0.3^0 ≈ 0.0282 Finally, let's sum up the probabilities: P(X ≥ 7) = 0.2668 + 0.2335 + 0.1211 + 0.0282 ≈ 0.6496 So, the probability that at least 7 clowns will perform the comedy skit during the performance is approximately 64.96%."},{"prompt":"a circus performance, there are 12 clowns and 8 acrobats.

First, let's find the total number of ways to choose 6 performers from the group of 12 clowns and 8 acrobats. This can be represented as a combination: C(20, 6), where 20 is the total number of performers (12 clowns + 8 acrobats) and 6 is the number of performers we want to choose.

C(8, 3) = 56 (ways to choose 3 acrobats) Since we want to choose 3 acrobats, we also need to choose 3 other performers from the remaining 12 clowns. This can be represented as a combination: C(12, 3). C(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * (12 - 3)!) C(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * 9!)

The magician shuffles the cards and asks you to pick one card randomly. What is the probability that you select the jack of hearts?","completion":"There is 1 jack of hearts and a total of 10 cards. The probability of selecting the jack of hearts is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (selecting the jack of hearts) to the total number of possible outcomes (selecting any of the 10 cards). Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) Probability = 1 (jack of hearts) / 10 (total cards) Probability = 1/10 or 0.1 So, the probability of selecting the jack of hearts is 1/10 or 0.1, which can also be expressed as 10%."},{"prompt":"What is the probability that a performer will hit a bullseye with a throwing knife during a live stage show, given that the performer has a success rate of 75% in practice and will attempt to hit the bullseye 4 times during the show?","completion":"To find the probability that the performer will hit at least one bullseye during the show, we can first find the probability that they will miss all four attempts and then subtract that from 1. The probability of missing a single attempt is 1 - 0.75 = 0.25. The probability of missing all four attempts is 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.00390625. Now, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of hitting at least one bullseye: 1 - 0.00390625 = 0.99609375.

To find the probability that all three cards drawn are diamonds, we can use the formula for probability: Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) First, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to draw three diamonds from the 13 diamonds in the deck. This can be calculated using combinations: C(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * (13-3)!) = 286 Next, we need to find the total number of possible outcomes, which is the number of ways to draw any three cards from the 52-card deck: C(52, 3) = 52! / (3! * (52-3)!) = 22100 Now, we can find the probability: Probability = 286 / 22100 ≈ 0.01294 So, the probability that all three cards drawn are diamonds is approximately 1.29%."},{"prompt":"a circus performance, there are 5 clowns and 7 acrobats.

There are 10 solo performances, and 5 of them do not involve magic tricks. So, the probability that the first chosen performance does not involve magic tricks is 5/10. After choosing one non-magic performance, there are now 9 performances left, 4 of which do not involve magic tricks. So, the probability that the second chosen performance does not involve magic tricks is 4/9. Finally, after choosing two non-magic performances, there are 8 performances left, 3 of which do not involve magic tricks. So, the probability that the third chosen performance does not involve magic tricks is 3/8. The probability that all three chosen performances do not involve magic tricks is the product of these probabilities: (5/10) * (4/9) * (3/8) = 60/720 = 1/12 Now, we'll subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that at least one of the chosen performances involves magic tricks: 1 - (1/12) = 11/12 So, the probability that at least one of the three chosen solo performances involves magic tricks is 11/12."},{"prompt":"a theater performance, there are 30 people in the audience.

Probability of selecting the first green ball (event A): There are 4 green balls and a total of 9 balls (5 red + 4 green), so the probability of selecting a green ball first is: P(A) = 4/9 2. Probability of selecting the second green ball given that the first one was green (event B|A): Since we have already selected one green ball, there are now 3 green balls left and a total of 8 balls (5 red + 3 green). So the probability of selecting a green ball again is: P(B|A) = 3/8 Now, we can find the probability of both events A and B happening: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A) = (4/9) * (3/8) = 12/72 Simplify the fraction: 12/72 = 1/6 So the probability of selecting two green balls without replacement is 1/6 or approximately 0.1667."},{"prompt":"A magician has a deck of 52 cards, including 4 aces.

Probability of 0 acts involving acrobats: Each act has a 0.8 probability of not involving acrobats (1 - 0.2 = 0.8). P(0 acts) = 0.8^10 ≈ 0.1074 Probability of 1 act involving acrobats: We can use the binomial probability formula: P(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x) where n = 10 (total acts), x = 1 (number of acts involving acrobats), p = 0.2 (probability of an act involving acrobats), and C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time. C(10, 1) = 10 (10 ways to choose 1 act out of 10) P(1 act) = 10 * 0.2^1 * 0.8^9 ≈ 0.2684 Now, we can find the complementary probability: P(at least 2 acts) = 1 - P(0 acts) - P(1 act) ≈ 1 - 0.1074 - 0.2684 ≈ 0.6242 So, the probability that at least 2 of the acts will involve acrobats is approximately 0.6242 or 62.42%."},{"prompt":"A magician has a deck of cards with 52 cards in it.

For the first performer to be a clown, there are 6 favorable outcomes (since there are 6 clowns) out of 10 possible outcomes (since there are 10 performers). So the probability of the first performer being a clown is: P(first performer is a clown) = 6/10 If the first performer is a clown, there are now 5 clowns and 4 tightrope walkers left, making a total of 9 performers. For the second performer to be a clown, there are 5 favorable outcomes (since there are 5 clowns left) out of 9 possible outcomes (since there are 9 performers left). So the probability of the second performer being a clown, given that the first performer is a clown, is: P(second performer is a clown | first performer is a clown) = 5/9 To find the probability that both the first and second performers are clowns, we multiply the probabilities: P(first two performers are clowns) = P(first performer is a clown) * P(second performer is a clown | first performer is a clown) = (6/10) * (5/9) P(first two performers are clowns) = 30/90 P(first two performers are clowns) = 1/3 So the probability that the first two performers assigned are clowns is 1/3 or approximately 0.3333."},{"prompt":"A magician has a deck of cards with 52 cards.

Instead of finding the probability that a specific actor will be chosen for at least one of the lead roles, we can find the probability that the actor will not be chosen for any of the lead roles and then subtract that from 1. There are 20 actors and 3 lead roles, so there are 20 - 3 = 17 non-lead roles. The probability that the specific actor will not be chosen for the first lead role is 19/20 (since there are 19 other actors). If the actor is not chosen for the first lead role, there are 18 actors left for the second lead role. So, the probability that the actor will not be chosen for the second lead role, given that they were not chosen for the first lead role, is 18/19. Similarly, the probability that the actor will not be chosen for the third lead role, given that they were not chosen for the first two lead roles, is 17/18. The probability that the actor will not be chosen for any of the lead roles is the product of these probabilities: P(not chosen for any lead role) = (19/20) * (18/19) * (17/18) = 17/20 Now, we can find the complementary probability: P(chosen for at least one lead role) = 1 - P(not chosen for any lead role) = 1 - (17/20) = 3/20 So, the probability that a specific actor will be chosen for at least one of the lead roles is 3/20 or 0.15 (15%)."},{"prompt":"A magician has a deck of cards consisting of 52 cards, including 13 hearts. If the magician randomly selects 3 cards from the deck, what is the probability of all three cards being hearts?","completion":"To find the probability of all three cards being hearts, we can use the formula for probability: P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes First, we need to find the total number of possible outcomes when selecting 3 cards from a deck of 52 cards. This can be calculated using combinations: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!) where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial. C(52, 3) = 52! / (3!(52-3)!) = 52! / (3!49!) = (52*51*50) / (3*2*1) = 22100 Now, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is selecting 3 hearts from the 13 hearts in the deck: C(13, 3) = 13! / (3!(13-3)!) = 13! / (3!10!) = (13*12*11) / (3*2*1) = 286 Now, we can find the probability: P(All three cards are hearts) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes P(All three cards are hearts) = 286 / 22100 = 0.01294 (rounded to 5 decimal places) So, the probability of all three cards being hearts is approximately 0.01294 or 1.294%."},{"prompt":"a circus performance, there are 8 clowns that can perform a specific trick during their act with a probability of 0.6.

P(X ≥ 5) = P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) + P(X = 7) + P(X = 8) Let's calculate each probability: 1. P(X = 5): C(8, 5) * 0.6^5 * 0.4^3 = 56 * 0.07776 * 0.064 = 0.3174 2. P(X = 6): C(8, 6) * 0.6^6 * 0.4^2 = 28 * 0.046656 * 0.16 = 0.2119 3. P(X = 7): C(8, 7) * 0.6^7 * 0.4^1 = 8 * 0.0279936 * 0.4 = 0.0896 4.

What is the probability that the volunteer wins the prize if they switch boxes?","completion":"Using the Monty Hall problem as a reference, the probability that the volunteer wins the prize if they switch boxes is 2/3 or approximately 66.67%. Here's why: When the volunteer initially chooses a box, there is a 1/3 chance that it contains the prize and a 2/3 chance that it does not. After the magician opens an empty box, the probability distribution does not change for the initial choice. So, the volunteer's initial choice still has a 1/3 chance of containing the prize. However, since the magician has revealed an empty box, the probability of the remaining unopened box containing the prize is now 2/3. This is because the probability must add up to 1, and if the initial choice has a 1/3 chance of being correct, the remaining probability (2/3) must be assigned to the other unopened box. So, if the volunteer switches boxes, they have a 2/3 chance of winning the prize."},{"prompt":"At a music concert, the probability of a specific type of song being performed is 0.3.

So, the expected number of this specific type of song to be performed is: Expected number = 0.3 * 15 = 4.5 So, we can expect 4.5 of this specific type of song to be performed during the concert. Since it's not possible to have half a song, this means that there will likely be around 4 or 5 of this specific type of song performed."},{"prompt":"A magician has 12 red cards and 8 black cards in a deck of cards for an upcoming performance.

However, the magician claims to be able to guess the card correctly 80% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the magician correctly guessing the chosen card is 80% of 1/52. To calculate this, we can multiply the probability of guessing the card by random chance (1/52) by the magician's success rate (80% or 0.8): (1/52) * 0.8 = 0.8/52 ≈ 0.015384615384615385 So, the probability that the magician will correctly guess the chosen card is approximately 0.0154 or 1.54%."},{"prompt":"A magician has a bag of 10 red balls and 8 blue balls.

The number of ways to choose 3 red balls out of 10 is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 10 and k = 3. C(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!) = 10! / (3!7!) = (10 × 9 × 8) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 120 The number of ways to choose 2 blue balls out of 8 is given by the combination formula with n = 8 and k = 2. C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 8! / (2!6!) = (8 × 7) / (2 × 1) = 28 Now, we need to find the total number of ways to choose 5 balls out of 18. Using the combination formula with n = 18 and k = 5: C(18, 5) = 18! / (5!(18-5)!) = 18! / (5!13!) = (18 × 17 × 16 × 15 × 14) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 8568 To find the probability of selecting exactly 3 red balls and 2 blue balls, we multiply the number of ways to choose 3 red balls and 2 blue balls and divide by the total number of ways to choose 5 balls: Probability = (Number of ways to choose 3 red and 2 blue balls) / (Total number of ways to choose 5 balls) Probability = (120 × 28) / 8568 = 3360 / 8568 ≈ 0.392 So, the probability of selecting exactly 3 red balls and 2 blue balls during her performance is approximately 0.392 or 39.2%."},{"prompt":"a magic show, the probability that the magician will pull a rabbit out of a hat is 0.25, the probability that he will make a dove appear from thin air is 0.15, and the probability that he will produce a bouquet of flowers is 0.6.

There are 26 red cards and 52 total cards in the deck, so the probability of choosing a red card is 26/52, which simplifies to 1/2. There are 26 black cards and 52 total cards in the deck, so the probability of choosing a black card is 26/52, which also simplifies to 1/2.

Probability of all three tricks being successful = (Probability of Trick 1 being successful) × (Probability of Trick 2 being successful) × (Probability of Trick 3 being successful) = 0.8 × 0.7 × 0.9 = 0.504 So, the probability that all three tricks will be successful is 0.504 or 50.4%."},{"prompt":"a theater performance, there are 5 musical acts, each with a probability of 0.8 of being well-received by the audience. What is the probability that at least 4 of the musical acts will be well-received by the audience?","completion":"To find the probability that at least 4 of the musical acts will be well-received, we need to consider two cases: exactly 4 acts are well-received, and all 5 acts are well-received. 1. Exactly 4 acts are well-received: There are 5 different ways this can happen (the first 4 acts are well-received and the last one is not, the first 3 and the last one are well-received and the fourth one is not, etc.). The probability of any one of these scenarios happening is (0.8)^4 * (1 - 0.8) = (0.8)^4 * 0.2. So the probability of exactly 4 acts being well-received is 5 * (0.8)^4 * 0.2. 2. All 5 acts are well-received: The probability of this happening is (0.8)^5. Now, we add the probabilities of these two cases to find the probability that at least 4 acts will be well-received: P(at least 4 acts well-received) = P(exactly 4 acts well-received) + P(all 5 acts well-received) = 5 * (0.8)^4 * 0.2 + (0.8)^5 = 5 * 0.4096 * 0.2 + 0.32768 = 0.4096 + 0.32768 = 0.73728 So, the probability that at least 4 of the musical acts will be well-received by the audience is approximately 0.73728 or 73.73%."},{"prompt":"A magician is performing a card trick where a spectator chooses a card from a deck of 52 cards.

There are 12 face cards in total (3 face cards per suit, and there are 4 suits). However, there are 3 face cards that are also spades (King, Queen, and Jack of Spades), which we should not count twice. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 13 (spades) + 12 (face cards) - 3 (spade face cards) = 22. The total number of possible outcomes is 52 (total cards in the deck). Therefore, the probability of selecting a card that is either a spade or a face card is: P(spade or face card) = (favorable outcomes) / (total outcomes) = 22 / 52 = 11 / 26."},{"prompt":"A magician has a bag of 10 balls, consisting of 5 red and 5 blue balls.

We will calculate the probabilities of these scenarios and then add them together. 1. Probability of getting exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball: There are C(5,2) ways to choose 2 red balls from the 5 available, and C(5,1) ways to choose 1 blue ball from the 5 available. So, there are C(5,2) * C(5,1) ways to choose 2 red balls and 1 blue ball. C(5,2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = 10 C(5,1) = 5! / (1! * (5-1)!) = 5 So, there are 10 * 5 = 50 ways to choose 2 red balls and 1 blue ball. There are a total of C(10,3) ways to choose any 3 balls from the 10 available. C(10,3) = 10! / (3! * (10-3)!) = 120 The probability of getting exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball is: P(2 red, 1 blue) = (Number of ways to choose 2 red balls and 1 blue ball) / (Total number of ways to choose 3 balls) P(2 red, 1 blue) = 50 / 120 2. Probability of getting all 3 red balls: There are C(5,3) ways to choose 3 red balls from the 5 available. C(5,3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 10 The probability of getting all 3 red balls is: P(3 red) = (Number of ways to choose 3 red balls) / (Total number of ways to choose 3 balls) P(3 red) = 10 / 120 Now, we add the probabilities of these two scenarios to find the probability of getting at least 2 red balls: P(at least 2 red) = P(2 red, 1 blue) + P(3 red) = (50 / 120) + (10 / 120) = 60 / 120 The probability of getting at least 2 red balls is 60/120, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5."},{"prompt":"a circus, there are 14 performers. Of these, 9 are acrobats and 5 are clowns. If the organizers randomly choose 3 performers to perform an act, what is the probability that all 3 performers are acrobats?","completion":"To find the probability, we will use the formula for combinations and the concept of probability. First, we need to find the total number of ways to choose 3 performers out of 14. This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) where n is the total number of performers (14 in this case) and k is the number of performers we want to choose (3 in this case). C(14, 3) = 14! / (3!(14-3)!) C(14, 3) = 14! / (3! * 11!) C(14, 3) = (14 * 13 * 12) / (3 * 2 * 1) C(14, 3) = 364 So, there are 364 ways to choose 3 performers out of 14. Now, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 acrobats out of 9. Using the same combination formula: C(9, 3) = 9! / (3!(9-3)!) C(9, 3) = 9! / (3! * 6!) C(9, 3) = (9 * 8 * 7) / (3 * 2 * 1) C(9, 3) = 84 So, there are 84 ways to choose 3 acrobats out of 9. Now, we can find the probability of choosing 3 acrobats by dividing the number of ways to choose 3 acrobats by the total number of ways to choose 3 performers: Probability = (Number of ways to choose 3 acrobats) / (Total number of ways to choose 3 performers) Probability = 84 / 364 Probability = 21 / 91 So, the probability of choosing 3 acrobats is 21/91 or approximately 0.2308 (rounded to four decimal places)."},{"prompt":"A magician has five red balls, three blue balls, and two green balls. He plans to select three balls at random one by one without replacement.

We need to find the number of ways to select two red balls and one blue ball, and then divide that by the total number of ways to select three balls from the ten available. First, let's find the number of ways to select two red balls and one blue ball. There are 5 red balls, so the number of ways to choose 2 of them is given by the combination formula: C(5,2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = 10. Similarly, there are 3 blue balls, so the number of ways to choose 1 of them is C(3,1) = 3! / (1! * (3-1)!) = 3. Now, we multiply these two numbers together to find the total number of ways to select two red balls and one blue ball: 10 * 3 = 30. Next, we need to find the total number of ways to select any three balls from the ten available. This is given by the combination formula: C(10,3) = 10! / (3! * (10-3)!) = 120. Finally, we divide the number of ways to select two red balls and one blue ball by the total number of ways to select three balls: 30 / 120 = 1/4.

The complement of the event \\"successfully completing the act without dropping any balls\\" is \\"dropping at least one ball.\\" The complement rule states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring. In this case, the probability of successfully completing the act without dropping any balls is 0.2. Therefore, the probability of dropping at least one ball is: P(dropping at least one ball) = 1 - P(successfully completing the act without dropping any balls) P(dropping at least one ball) = 1 - 0.2 P(dropping at least one ball) = 0.8 So, the probability that the performer will drop at least one ball during the juggling act is 0.8 or 80%."},{"prompt":"A magician has three hats, one red, one blue, and one green.

There are 3 hats, so the probability of selecting the blue hat is 1/3. There are 52 cards in a standard deck, and there are 4 Jacks (one in each suit). So, the probability of drawing a Jack is 4/52, which simplifies to 1/13.

Case 1: n has only one prime factor. Let n = p^a, where p is prime and a is a positive integer. Then, 12 = φ(n) = p^a * (1 - 1/p). Since 12 is not a prime power, this case is not possible. Case 2: n has two prime factors. Let n = p1^a1 * p2^a2, where p1 and p2 are distinct primes and a1, a2 are positive integers. Then, 12 = φ(n) = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2). We can rewrite this as: 12 = (p1^a1 - p1^(a1-1)) * (p2^a2 - p2^(a2-1)). Now, we consider the possible factor pairs of 12: (1, 12), (2, 6), and (3, 4). 1. (1, 12): This gives p1^a1 - p1^(a1-1) = 1 and p2^a2 - p2^(a2-1) = 12. The first equation implies that p1 = 2 and a1 = 1. The second equation implies that p2^a2 - p2^(a2-1) = 12, which has no solution for prime p2 and positive integer a2. 2. (2, 6): This gives p1^a1 - p1^(a1-1) = 2 and p2^a2 - p2^(a2-1) = 6. The first equation implies that p1 = 2 and a1 = 2. The second equation implies that p2^a2 - p2^(a2-1) = 6, which has a solution p2 = 3 and a2 = 1. Thus, n = 2^2 * 3^1 = 12 is a possible value. 3.

The second equation implies that p2^a2 - p2^(a2-1) = 4, which has a solution p2 = 2 and a2 = 3. Thus, n = 3^1 * 2^3 = 24 is a possible value.

Show that the congruence x^2 ≡ -1 (mod p) has a solution.","completion":"To show that the congruence x^2 ≡ -1 (mod p) has a solution, we will use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a such that gcd(a, p) = 1, we have a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p). Given that p ≡ 3 (mod 4), we can write p = 4k + 3 for some integer k. Now consider the following expression: a = (x^2 + 1)^((p-1)/2) Since p is a prime number and x is an integer, gcd(x^2 + 1, p) = 1. Therefore, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem: a^((p-1)/2) ≡ (x^2 + 1)^((p-1)/2) ≡ 1 (mod p) Now, let's consider the expression (x^2 + 1)^((p+1)/2). We can rewrite this expression as: (x^2 + 1)^((p+1)/2) = (x^2 + 1)^((p-1)/2) * (x^2 + 1) Since (x^2 + 1)^((p-1)/2) ≡ 1 (mod p), we have: (x^2 + 1)^((p+1)/2) ≡ 1 * (x^2 + 1) ≡ x^2 + 1 (mod p) Now, let's raise both sides of the congruence x^2 ≡ -1 (mod p) to the power of (p+1)/2: (x^2)^((p+1)/2) ≡ (-1)^((p+1)/2) (mod p) Since p = 4k + 3, we have (p+1)/2 = 2k + 2. Therefore, the left side of the congruence becomes: x^(p+1) ≡ (-1)^(2k+2) (mod p) By Fermat's Little Theorem, x^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p), so we can rewrite the left side as: x^(p+1) ≡ x * x^(p-1) ≡ x (mod p) On the right side, we have (-1)^(2k+2) = (-1)^2 * (-1)^(2k) = 1 * 1 = 1. So the congruence becomes: x ≡ 1 (mod p) This implies that x^2 + 1 ≡ 1^2 + 1 ≡ 2 (mod p). Since we have shown that (x^2 + 1)^((p+1)/2) ≡ x^2 + 1 (mod p), we can conclude that: (x^2 + 1)^((p+1)/2) ≡ 2 (mod p) Now, let's consider the Legendre symbol (2|p). By the quadratic reciprocity theorem, we have: (2|p) = (-1)^((p^2 - 1)/8) Since p = 4k + 3, we have p^2 - 1 = (4k + 3)^2 - 1 = 16k^2 + 24k + 8. Therefore, (p^2 - 1)/8 = 2k^2 + 3k + 1, which is an odd integer. Thus, we have: (2|p) = (-1)^((p^2 - 1)/8) = -1 This means that the congruence x^2 ≡ 2 (mod p) has no solution. However, we have shown that (x^2 + 1)^((p+1)/2) ≡ 2 (mod p), which implies that x^2 + 1 ≡ 2 (mod p) has a solution.

Case 2: p ≡ -1 (mod 5) or p ≡ 4 (mod 5) In this case, by the Quadratic Reciprocity Law, we have that 5 is a quadratic non-residue modulo p.

This is because 71 is a prime number, and every number less than 71 is coprime to 71. These pairs of numbers are called multiplicative inverses modulo 71. For example, the multiplicative inverse of 2 is 36, because 2 × 36 ≡ 1 (mod 71). Similarly, the multiplicative inverse of 3 is 24, because 3 × 24 ≡ 1 (mod 71).

Provide a detailed proof to support your answer.","completion":"Goldbach's Conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. To find the smallest even number that can be expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers, we can start by examining the even numbers greater than 2. The smallest even number greater than 2 is 4. However, 4 cannot be expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers because the only way to express 4 as the sum of two numbers is 2 + 2, and 2 is not an odd prime number. The next smallest even number is 6. We can express 6 as the sum of two odd prime numbers: 3 + 3. Both 3 and 3 are odd prime numbers, so 6 is the smallest even number that can be expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers according to Goldbach's Conjecture. Proof: To prove that 6 is the smallest even number that can be expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers, we can use proof by contradiction. Assume that there exists an even number smaller than 6 that can be expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers. The only even number smaller than 6 and greater than 2 is 4. However, we have already shown that 4 cannot be expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers. This contradicts our assumption, so our assumption must be false.

Prime numbers up to 50: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47 Now, let's check if 2p + 1 is prime for each of these prime numbers: 2: 2(2) + 1 = 5 (prime) 3: 2(3) + 1 = 7 (prime) 5: 2(5) + 1 = 11 (prime) 7: 2(7) + 1 = 15 (not prime) 11: 2(11) + 1 = 23 (prime) 13: 2(13) + 1 = 27 (not prime) 17: 2(17) + 1 = 35 (not prime) 19: 2(19) + 1 = 39 (not prime) 23: 2(23) + 1 = 47 (prime) 29: 2(29) + 1 = 59 (not within the range of 50) 31: 2(31) + 1 = 63 (not prime) 37: 2(37) + 1 = 75 (not prime) 41: 2(41) + 1 = 83 (not within the range of 50) 43: 2(43) + 1 = 87 (not prime) 47: 2(47) + 1 = 95 (not prime) So, the Sophie Germain primes up to 50 are: 2, 3, 5, 11, and 23."},{"prompt":"What is the smallest Sophie Germain prime greater than 50?","completion":"A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime.

We are looking for the smallest Sophie Germain prime that can be written as the difference of two non-zero perfect squares, i.e., p = a^2 - b^2, where a and b are integers. Using the difference of squares factorization, we can rewrite p as: p = (a + b)(a - b) Since p is prime, either (a + b) = p and (a - b) = 1, or (a + b) = 1 and (a - b) = p.

However, the difference between two prime numbers can only be even if one of the prime numbers is 2 (since all other prime numbers are odd). So, for an even number to be expressed as the difference between two prime numbers, it must be in the form of (P - 2), where P is a prime number. For the smallest even number, 2, there is no prime number P such that P - 2 = 2, as that would require P to be equal to 4, which is not a prime number.

For n = 37, we can rewrite it as: 37 = 2^3 * 4 + 1, with r = 3 and d = 4. Now, we need to choose some random integers (called witnesses) a, where 2 ≤ a ≤ n-2.

Now, we need to find 3P, which is P + 2P: For point addition, we use the formula: λ = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) (mod p) ν = λ^2 - x1 - x2 (mod p) Here, P = (1, 2) and 2P = (9, 7). λ = (7 - 2) / (9 - 1) (mod 11) λ = 5 / 8 (mod 11) Since 8 has an inverse modulo 11, we can multiply both sides by the inverse of 8 (which is 7) to get: λ = 5 * 7 (mod 11) λ = 35 (mod 11) λ = 2 (mod 11) Now, we can find ν: ν = λ^2 - x1 - x2 (mod 11) ν = 2^2 - 1 - 9 (mod 11) ν = 4 - 1 - 9 (mod 11) ν = -6 (mod 11) ν = 5 (mod 11) So, 3P = (2, 5). Therefore, Alice's public key in the group of points on the elliptic curve modulo 11 is (2, 5)."},{"prompt":"Find the point multiplication of the point (2,5) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 6x + 7 over a prime field of 11 with the scalar value of 3.","completion":"To find the point multiplication of the point (2,5) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 6x + 7 over a prime field of 11 with the scalar value of 3, we will perform point doubling and point addition operations. First, let's find 2*(2,5) using point doubling: The formula for point doubling is: x3 = (3x1^2 + a) * (2y1)^(-1) - 2x1 (mod p) y3 = (3x1^2 + a) * (x1 - x3) - y1 (mod p) Here, a = 6, p = 11, x1 = 2, and y1 = 5. x3 = (3*(2^2) + 6) * (2*5)^(-1) - 2*2 (mod 11) x3 = (3*4 + 6) * 10^(-1) - 4 (mod 11) x3 = (12 + 6) * 10^(-1) - 4 (mod 11) x3 = 18 * 10^(-1) - 4 (mod 11) x3 = 7 * 10^(-1) - 4 (mod 11) To find the inverse of 10 modulo 11, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm or simply try different numbers until we find the inverse. In this case, the inverse of 10 modulo 11 is 2. x3 = 7 * 2 - 4 (mod 11) x3 = 14 - 4 (mod 11) x3 = 10 (mod 11) Now, let's find y3: y3 = (3*(2^2) + 6) * (2 - 10) - 5 (mod 11) y3 = (12 + 6) * (-8) - 5 (mod 11) y3 = 18 * (-8) - 5 (mod 11) y3 = (-144) - 5 (mod 11) y3 = -149 (mod 11) y3 = 4 (mod 11) So, 2*(2,5) = (10, 4). Now, let's find 3*(2,5) by adding (2,5) to the result of 2*(2,5): The formula for point addition is: x3 = (y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1) - x1 - x2 (mod p) y3 = (y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1) * (x1 - x3) - y1 (mod p) Here, x1 = 2, y1 = 5, x2 = 10, and y2 = 4. x3 = (4 - 5) * (10 - 2)^(-1) - 2 - 10 (mod 11) x3 = (-1) * 8^(-1) - 12 (mod 11) x3 = (-1) * 8^(-1) - 1 (mod 11) The inverse of 8 modulo 11 is 7. x3 = (-1) * 7 - 1 (mod 11) x3 = -7 - 1 (mod 11) x3 = -8 (mod 11) x3 = 3 (mod 11) Now, let's find y3: y3 = (4 - 5) * (10 - 2)^(-1) * (2 - 3) - 5 (mod 11) y3 = (-1) * 8^(-1) * (-1) - 5 (mod 11) y3 = (-1) * 7 * (-1) - 5 (mod 11) y3 = 7 - 5 (mod 11) y3 = 2 (mod 11) So, 3*(2,5) = (3, 2)."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:G},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},A={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},_=["disabled"],I={key:0},L={key:1};function E(n,e,h,c,r,a){const u=b("PoemCard");return i(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),w(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>r.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[g,r.searchQuery]]),r.searchQuery?(i(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>r.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):m("",!0)]),t("div",A,[(i(!0),o(y,null,v(a.displayedPoems,(s,f)=>(i(),x(u,{key:f,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),a.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),o("div",M,' No results found for "'+d(r.searchQuery)+'".
