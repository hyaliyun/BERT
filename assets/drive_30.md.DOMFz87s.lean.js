( mathbb{Q} ) does not necessarily contain the integer 2016 unless it has been specifically defined within the field. - **Conclusion:** Statement (2) is false. 4. **Checking Statement (3)**: - **Statement (3):** The set ( P = { x mid x = 3k, k in mathbb{Z} } ) is a field. - **Solution:** - The set ( P ) can be written as ( P = { ..., -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, ... } ). - We need to check closure under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and existence of multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements. - Closure Under Addition: For ( a = 3k ) and ( b = 3m ) (with ( k, m in mathbb{Z} )), we have ( a + b = 3k + 3m = 3(k + m) ). Since ( k + m in mathbb{Z} ), ( a + b in P ). - Closure Under Subtraction: For ( a = 3k ) and ( b = 3m ), we have ( a - b = 3k - 3m = 3(k - m) ). Again, ( k-m in mathbb{Z} ), so ( a - b in P ). - Closure Under Multiplication: For ( a = 3k ) and ( b = 3m ), we have ( a cdot b = 3k cdot 3m = 9km ), which is not necessarily in the form ( 3 cdot (text{integer}) ). - Multiplicative Inverse: For ( a = 3k ) where ( k neq 0 ), we need ( frac{1}{a} = frac{1}{3k} in P ), but since ( frac{1}{3k} ) is not an integer, ( P ) does not contain the inverse of its elements. - **Conclusion:** Statement (3) is false. 5. **Checking Statement (4)**: - **Statement (4):** There exists a set of rational numbers that is a field. - **Solution:** The set of all rational numbers ( mathbb{Q} ) forms a field as it satisfies all the conditions mentioned in point 1. - Closure Under Addition: ( forall a, b in mathbb{Q}, a + b in mathbb{Q} ). - Closure Under Subtraction: ( forall a, b in mathbb{Q}, a - b in mathbb{Q} ). - Closure Under Multiplication: ( forall a, b in mathbb{Q}, a cdot b in mathbb{Q} ). - Closure Under Division: ( forall a, b in mathbb{Q} (b neq 0), frac{a}{b} in mathbb{Q} ). - **Conclusion:** Statement (4) is true. **Conclusion**: The correct answers are the statements (1) and (4).

The formula for the circumradius R of a triangle given one side and the opposite angle is: [ R = frac{AC}{2 sin B} ] Plugging in the given values: [ R = frac{sqrt{2}}{2 sin 45^circ} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2 left( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} right)} = frac{sqrt{2}}{sqrt{2}} = 1 ] We found that the circumradius R of triangle ABC is 1.

The equation of the hyperbola can be rewritten as x^2 - frac{a^2}{b^2}y^2 = a^2. Since the right focus of the hyperbola is (4, 0), we have c = 4, where c is the distance from the center to the focus of the hyperbola. For a hyperbola, we have c^2 = a^2 + b^2, and the eccentricity e = frac{c}{a}. Given that the right focus of the hyperbola coincides with the focus of the parabola, we have c = 4.

For the hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, we know that b^2 = a^2(e^2 - 1). Substituting b^2 = a^2(e^2 - 1) into 16 = a^2 + b^2, we get 16 = a^2 + a^2(e^2 - 1) = a^2e^2.

Each segment A_i A_{i+1} forms an angle angle A_i O A_{i+1} with reference to point O. - The total sum of these oriented angles is 2pi m for some integer m where m must capture the effect of the symmetric pairs. 6. **Odd Number of Turns:** - Each oriented angle angle A_i O A_{i+1} in the total traversal effectively adds up to give a sum that when divided by 2pi, yields the winding number. - Given the geometry and symmetry of the problem, the summed total divided by 2pi results in an integer value. - Since our polygonal chain is symmetric, the effect is such that m captures the necessary symmetry leading to an odd integer. # Conclusion: By virtue of the geometric and algebraic considerations of symmetric polygonal chains, the winding number around O, when computed as the sum of oriented angles divided by 2pi, must be odd.

Here’s a detailed examination: 1. **Solution 1 Analysis:** - Consider an arbitrary acute-angled triangle triangle ABC . Let's focus on the special case where angle C = 60^circ . - Since angle AA_1B and angle BB_1A are right angles (as they are altitudes), quadrilateral AB_1A_1B is cyclic. - By the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, we know that angle A_1B_1C = angle ABC . - Given the similarity between triangle ABC and triangle A_1B_1C by triangle similarity criterion (AA similarity): [ frac{A_1C}{AC} = cos(angle C) = frac{1}{2} ] Hence: [ A_1B_1 = frac{1}{2} AB ] - Points B_1C_1 and A_1C_1 act as medians in right triangles formed with the hypotenuse AB . Therefore, B_1C_1 = C_1A_1 = frac{AB}{2} . - If triangle A_1B_1C_1 is equilateral: [ B_1C_1 = C_1A_1 = frac{AB}{2} ] - This setup implies it is impossible to reconstruct the original angles at vertices A and B of triangle ABC using only A_1 , B_1 , and C_1 . 2. **Solution 2 Analysis:** - Notice that A_1C_1 = B_1C_1 = frac{AB}{2} . - Consider the circle with center C_1 , introducing a diameter A'B' where points on the circle are ordered as A' - B_1 - A_1 - B' . - If we draw lines from A'B_1 and B'A_1 intersecting at point C' , then: - In triangle A'B'C': - The point C_1 is the midpoint of A'B' , and angles angle A'A_1B' and angle B'B_1A' are right because they are subtensed by the diameter, implying they are right angles. - This suggests various possible triangles triangle A'B'C' , confirming infinitely many possibilities for triangle ABC . Therefore, reconstructing the original triangle from A_1 , B_1 , and C_1 is not feasible. 3. **Solution 3 Analysis:** - Let triangle triangle ABC be non-isosceles: - Since A_1C_1 = B_1C_1 , consider symmetry about the perpendicular bisector l of A_1B_1 . - This symmetry keeps point C fixed while swapping A_1 and B_1 , creating triangle triangle A'B'C' : - Triangles triangle having points A'_1 , B'_1 , C_1 at the same locations imply non-uniqueness. - Consequently, as triangle A'B'C' cannot coincide entirely with triangle ABC , the original triangle ABC cannot be reconstructed uniquely. # Conclusion: From these analyses, we affirm that reconstructing the original triangle ABC from points A_1 , B_1 , and C_1 alone is not possible due to the ambiguity created by multiple potential triangles satisfying given point conditions.

When they move straight or turn, their relative positions and movement directions must be tracked: - On a straights move: They stay within the same color. - On a 120^circ turn: They move to an adjacent triangle which has a different color, alternately switching between colors with each move. 4. **Pattern realization**: If two cars start from the same triangle, they will always switch colors symmetrically due to the 120^circ turn rule. So one car will always be on one color, and the other on the alternate color. - Hence, as one moves, one color will always be to the left and the other to the right of the car for the entire path length. - Due to this consistent difference in coloring patterns, the cars will never land on the same colored triangle again unless they both arrive back to the start point simultaneously. 5. **Conclusion**: Given this, they will never meet on a street but can only meet at an intersection under strict rules of movement because of the maintained color symmetry and relative movement restriction.

Consider: - The total number of two-digit numbers is 90 (from 10 to 99). - Therefore, if every such number could be an exact square, there would be 90 corresponding four-digit squares.

Since ABC is an equilateral triangle, each of its internal angles is 60^circ. Focus is on triangle ACF. Since BCFGH is a regular pentagon, angle BCF = 108^circ. Also, as ABC is equilateral, angle ACB = 60^circ. In the triangle ACF, angle ACB forms part of angle ACF. Therefore, the measure of angle ACF can be calculated as follows: mangle ACF = mangle ACB + mangle BCF = 60^circ + 108^circ = 168^circ. Since ACF is an isosceles triangle (because AC = CF as both are sides of regular and equal shapes joined at a common vertex C), and triangle ACF is isosceles, it implies that angles CAF and CFA are equal. Using the sum of angles in a triangle, we have: mangle CAF + mangle CFA + mangle ACF = 180^circ, 2mangle CAF + 168^circ = 180^circ, 2mangle CAF = 12^circ, mangle CAF = 6^circ.

Note that: [ 2 cdot 1999 = 3998 < 4000 ] This inequality ensures that even after repeatedly removing cities and their incident roads, there will be cities left with at least 3 incident roads. 2. **Constructing Layered Sets:** After removing all such cities and roads, we focus on the remaining set of cities where every city has at least 3 roads.

Applying the formula for the number of divisors, we get: (n+1)(m+1) = 6 3. To find possible values of ( n ) and ( m ) that satisfy this equation: - Possible factor pairs of 6 are ( (6, 1), (3, 2), (2, 3), (1, 6) ). - Among these, only pairs where ( n+1 ) and ( m+1 ) both result in integers give us feasible results: - ( (n+1, m+1) = (3, 2) implies n=2, m=1 ) - ( (n+1, m+1) = (2, 3) implies n=1, m=2 ) (since ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ) are distinct, the order does not matter) 4. Therefore, ( n = 2 ) and ( m = 1 ) (or vice versa) implies that the number is ( p_1^2 times p_2 ). 5.

We need to find the radius ( r ) of a sphere that is tangent to the plane and to all three given spheres. We'll denote the radius of each of the three given spheres as ( R ). **1. Setting Up the Configuration:** Let's place the plane in the (xy)-plane (i.e., ( z = 0 ) in a coordinate system). Assume the centers of the three given spheres are at points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) with coordinates ( (0, 0, R), (2R, 0, R), ) and ( (R, sqrt{3}R, R) ) respectively. This positions the centers of the spheres such that: - They are all at distance ( R ) above the (xy)-plane. - The centers form an equilateral triangle of side length ( 2R ) when projected onto the (xy)-plane. **2. Tangency Conditions:** We know that each of the new desired sphere ( s' ) must be tangent to: 1. The (xy)-plane. 2. All three given spheres with radius ( R ). Let the radius of the desired sphere be ( r ), and the center of the desired sphere be at point ( D ) with coordinates ( (x_D, y_D, r) ).

Identifying the smallest positive integer solution ((x^*, y^*)) such that ( x^* < 2^{k+1} ): [ b = mx^* < 2a - 1 ] 5. This ensures ( b(b+1) = mx^*(mx^* + 1) ) is a multiple of ( 2a ). Method 2: 1.

Then, frac{c-d}{c+d} = frac{1}{y}, so the expression simplifies to y + frac{1}{y} = frac{y^2 + 1}{y}. Assume the expression frac{y^2 + 1}{y} = m. Rearranging gives the quadratic equation y^2 - my + 1 = 0. The discriminant of this equation is m^2 - 4. For the quadratic to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative, i.e., m^2 - 4 geq 0. Thus, m geq 2 or m leq -2. However, since the expression frac{y^2 + 1}{y} is always positive for positive y, the smallest positive m is 2. To achieve this, we set y = 1, which occurs when c = d (but this would violate c > d), or we can set y values that tend to 1 but do not equal 1. However, since c+d is odd, and c-d must also be a non-zero integer, we need to find the smallest odd values of c+d and c-d that satisfy this. Consider c = 2, d = 1, which gives c+d = 3 and c-d = 1.

The distance d from the center (0,0) of the circle to the line ax + by + 2 = 0 is calculated using the formula for the distance from a point to a line: [d = frac{|2|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} = frac{2}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}] Given a^2 + b^2 > 1, we cannot directly compare d with the radius of the circle (which is 1) without more information. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the line ax + by + 2 = 0 necessarily intersects with the circle based solely on the condition that (a,b) is outside the circle. This indicates that being outside the circle is not a sufficient condition for the line to intersect with the circle. **Step 2: Checking Necessity** If the line ax + by + 2 = 0 intersects with the circle x^2 + y^2 = 1, then the distance d from the center (0,0) of the circle to the line is less than the radius of the circle, which is 1.

Therefore, quadrilateral (EFGH) has all its sides equal since all segments formed from the midpoints of each side of the isosceles trapezoid are congruent. - Hence, (EFGH) is not just a parallelogram but a rhombus, because all sides are congruent, which is exactly what characterizes a rhombus. 4. **Calculating Side Lengths**: - Given the diagonals of the original trapezoid are both 10 units, by connecting midpoints of the diagonals (in the context of the isosceles trapezoid's symmetry), each side of the rhombus (EFGH) is half the length of the diagonal: [ text{Side length of } EF = frac{text{Diagonal length}}{2} = frac{10}{2} = 5 ] Thus, all sides of the rhombus (EFGH) are 5 units. 5. **Calculating the Angles**: - Since the diagonals of the trapezoid intersect at (40^circ), these diagonals act as lines of symmetry, effectively dividing the rhombus into angles summing to (360^circ). - Diagonals in the rhombus bisect the angles hence: - Two angles (40^circ) at the intersection points (acute angles of the rhombus). - Sum of the two obtuse angles at adjacent vertices being supplementary to (40^circ): (180^circ - 40^circ = 140^circ). 6. **Conclusion**: - The rhombus (EFGH) therefore has angles (40^circ, 140^circ, 40^circ, 140^circ) and sides 5 units each.

Given that x is the integer part and y is the decimal part, we have: [ x = 10, quad y = sqrt{3}-1 ] Therefore, to find x-y, we calculate: [ x-y = 10 - (sqrt{3}-1) = 11 - sqrt{3} ] Summarizing the solutions: 1.

Given that we have 3 moles of CO2 and 6 moles of NH3, we need to determine the limiting reactant, which is the reactant that will be completely consumed first and thus limit the amount of product formed.

Consider the neighbors of these vertices (A) and (B): (C) (neighbor of (A)) and (D) (neighbor of (B)). 4.

Next, consider the vertex (E), which is the vertex that lies on the perpendicular bisector of (AB) (directly opposite (AB)). 7.

Consider 7 vertices of the same color among the 13 vertices of the polygon (we can always find 7 vertices of the same color). 2.

Since there are 13 vertices, there are a total of 6 different segment lengths that can be obtained by connecting the vertices. 4. By the pigeonhole principle, since we have 21 line segments and only 6 different lengths, there must be at least ( lceil frac{21}{6} rceil = 4 ) segments that have the same length. 5. These segments connect vertices of the same color, and since there are 7 vertices, they must connect vertices such that at least one of them shares a vertex. 6. These equal-length segments form the sides of an isosceles triangle with vertices all of the same color. Thus, there must exist an isosceles triangle formed by vertices of the same color. --- # Analytical Note: - We can also support the previous claims by using graph theory and combinatorial principles: - Label the vertices of the 13-sided polygon from 1 to 13. - By Van der Waerden's theorem, any coloring of a sufficiently large set divided into a given number of colors will always contain a monochromatic arithmetic sequence. - In our case, for k=2 (two colors) and l=3 (sequence of three), Van der Waerden's theorem guarantees that in a set of n vertices, sufficiently large in our case here it is 13, there exists a monochromatic arithmetic sequence of length 3. - This arithmetic sequence corresponds to vertices forming an isosceles triangle.

The atomic weights for each element are approximately: - Carbon (C): 12 amu (atomic mass units) - Hydrogen (H): 1 amu - Oxygen (O): 16 amu Given that the compound has 4 carbon atoms and 1 oxygen atom, we can calculate the mass contributed by these atoms as follows: Mass from C = 4 atoms * 12 amu/atom = 48 amu Mass from O = 1 atom * 16 amu/atom = 16 amu Total mass from C and O = 48 amu (from C) + 16 amu (from O) = 64 amu Now, we know the total molecular weight of the compound is 65 amu. To find the mass contributed by hydrogen, we subtract the mass from C and O from the total molecular weight: Mass from H = Total molecular weight - Mass from C and O Mass from H = 65 amu - 64 amu = 1 amu Since each hydrogen atom has a mass of approximately 1 amu, the number of hydrogen atoms in the compound is equal to the mass contributed by hydrogen: Number of H atoms = Mass from H / Mass of one H atom Number of H atoms = 1 amu / 1 amu/atom = 1 Therefore, the compound contains boxed{1} hydrogen atom."},{"prompt":"Given a triangle ( triangle ABC ) with circumradius ( R ), if the expression ( frac{a cos A + b cos B + c cos C}{a sin B + b sin C + c sin A} = frac{a + b + c}{9R} ), where ( a, b, c ) are the lengths of the sides opposite to angles ( angle A, angle B, angle C ) respectively, determine the measures of the three internal angles of ( triangle ABC ).","completion":"Given: triangle ABC is a triangle with circumradius R . The sides opposite to angles angle A, angle B, and angle C are a , b , and c , respectively. The relation given is: [ frac{a cos A + b cos B + c cos C}{a sin B + b sin C + c sin A} = frac{a + b + c}{9R} ] We are to find the measure of the three interior angles of triangle ABC. 1. **Circumcircle Centre and Areas:** Let O be the circumcenter of triangle ABC. By properties of the circumcircle, we have: [ 9R(a cos A + b cos B + c cos C) = 18 left( S_{triangle ABO} + S_{triangle ACO} + S_{triangle BCO} right) ] Since the total area of the triangle can be written as the sum of these areas, we get: [ 18 left( S_{triangle ABO} + S_{triangle ACO} + S_{triangle BCO} right) = 18 S_{triangle ABC} ] Thus, [ 9R(a cos A + b cos B + c cos C) = 18 S_{triangle ABC} ] 2. **Simplifying the Denominator:** Consider the term a sin B + b sin C + c sin A. By the application of the Sine Rule and properties of the circumcircle, we have: [ (a+b+c)(a sin B + b sin C + c sin A) geq 3(ab sin C + bc sin A + ca sin B) ] We use the Cosine Rule and Sine Rule to express the areas of the sub-triangles in terms of a, b, c and R. By well-known trigonometric relationships, we express the left-hand side in terms of the area of the triangle triangle ABC: [ (a+b+c)(a sin B + b sin C + c sin A) geq 3 left(ab sin C + bc sin A + ca sin B right) = 18 S_{triangle ABC} ] Therefore, equating both expressions and simplifying, we obtain: [ frac{a cos A + b cos B + c cos C}{a sin B + b sin C + c sin A} = frac{a + b + c}{9R} ] 3. **Establishing Equality:** For equality to hold in the above inequalities, the ratios must be constant: [ a sin B = b sin C = c sin A ] Given this, use the sine rule: [ frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C} = 2R ] Since a, b, c are constants, it follows that: [ sin A = sin B = sin C ] 4. **Conclusion:** Given that sin A = sin B = sin C, in a triangle, this can only be true if all angles are equal. Therefore, angle A = angle B = angle C . Hence: [ A = B = C = 60^circ ] Thus, triangle ABC is equilateral. boxed{A = B = C = 60^circ}"},{"prompt":"Steve's new book sells 1,000,000 copies.

Since Steve's agent takes 10% of that, Steve actually keeps 90% of ( x ) for each copy sold. So, for each copy sold, Steve keeps ( 0.90x ). Steve sold 1,000,000 copies, but he got an advance for 100,000 copies, so the number of copies for which he gets additional money is ( 1,000,000 - 100,000 = 900,000 ) copies. The total amount Steve kept, not counting the advance, is 1,620,000. This amount comes from the 900,000 copies sold beyond the advance.

This means that: 233 = d * k + 79 for some integer k. We need to find a value of d that satisfies this equation. Since 233 - 79 = 154, d must be a factor of 154. The factors of 154 are 1, 2, 7, 11, 14, 22, 77, and 154. However, we know that 1 < a < b < c, so d cannot be 1, and it must be the product of at least three different factors.

Can each side of the rectangle intersect an odd number of grid lines?","completion":"1. **Assumptions and Coordinate Setup:** We are given a rectangle (ABCD), with its sides making a (45^circ) angle with the grid lines, and the vertices do not lie on the grid lines. Let's assume it is possible for each side of this rectangle to intersect an odd number of grid lines. We will place the origin of the coordinate system at a grid line intersection and align the axes along the grid lines. Let the vertex (A) have the smallest abscissa and the vertex (B) the smallest ordinate. 2. **Notation for Projections:** Denote the projections of the vertices (A, B, C, D) on the (x)-axis by (A_x, B_x, C_x, D_x), and on the (y)-axis by (A_y, B_y, C_y, D_y). 3. **Vertex Coordinates:** Since the vertices do not lie on the grid lines, these projections (A_x, B_x, C_x, D_x) and (A_y, B_y, C_y, D_y) are non-integer values. Given their placements: [ overrightarrow{D_x C_x} = overrightarrow{A_x B_x} ] [ A_x D_x = AD cos 45^circ geq AB cos 45^circ = A_x B_x ] Thus, along the (x)-axis, the points are ordered as (A_x, B_x, D_x, C_x) and along the (y)-axis as (B_y, A_y, C_y, D_y). 4. **Counting Lattice Line Intersections:** Let (t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4) represent the number of integer points on the segments (A_x B_x, B_y A_y, D_x C_x, C_y D_y), and (s_1, s_2) represent the number of integer points on the diagonal segments (B_x D_x) and (A_y C_y). The intersections with grid lines can be counted as follows: [ t_1 text{ on } AB, quad t_4 + s_2 text{ on } AD, quad t_3 text{ on } DC, quad t_2 text{ on } BC, etc. ] 5. **Lemma Application:** From the lemma, the number of integer points on any segment of equal length (d) differs by at most 1 between segments. Thus: [ t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4 text{ differ by at most 1, implying they are } t text{ or } t+1 ] Similarly, (s_1) and (s_2) can differ by at most 1, so they are (s) or (s+1). 6. **Verification of Odd Counts:** For each side to intersect an odd number of grid lines: [ t_1 + t_2 quad text{must be odd, so} quad t_1 neq t_2 ] Without loss of generality, let (t_1 = t) and (t_2 = t+1). If (t_3 = t), then (t_4 = t+1), and similarly (s_1) and (s_2) must fulfill the number of intersections. However, checking: [ s_1 + s_2 = left(t_1 + t_4 + s_1 + s_2right) - left(t_1 + t_4right) = (2t+1) = text{even or odd contradiction}. ] Similarly, the cases (t_3 = t+1) leading to (t_4 = t) also lead to contradictions. 7. **Conclusion:** There is no consistent assignment of intersections fulfilling the odd condition without contradictions as per the lemma.

Substituting into g(x): g(x) = (lfloor 2x rfloor - 2x) + (2x - x - 1) = (lfloor 2x rfloor - 2x) + x - 1.

Hence, we start with 500 primes, all of which are congruent to (1 mod 4) on the blackboard. 3. **Defining Parity**: - Let (P) denote the parity (odd or even) of the number of primes on the blackboard that are congruent to (3 mod 4). Initially, since all primes on the blackboard are congruent to (1 mod 4), (P) is even (specifically, (P = 0)). 4. **Game Dynamics and Parity Change**: - During each turn, a player selects a positive integer (n) and chooses to erase ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_n ) from the blackboard. - The product of these primes is ( p_1 cdot p_2 cdot ldots cdot p_n ), and the player writes the prime factors of ( p_1 cdot p_2 cdot ldots cdot p_n - 2 ) back on the blackboard. - Recall the properties of prime factorizations: - If (k equiv 1 mod 4), the number of primes congruent to (3 mod 4) in its prime factorization is even. - If (k equiv 3 mod 4), this number is odd. 5. **Effect of Moves on Parity (P)**: - When a player makes a move, they change the primes on the blackboard. - Initially assume (p_1 cdot p_2 cdot ldots cdot p_n) and consider (p_1 cdot p_2 cdot ldots cdot p_n - 2): - If the current product is congruent to (1 mod 4), (P) remains even. - If it is congruent to (3 mod 4), (P) changes to odd. - Therefore, each move by a player changes the parity of (P): - (A)'s move results in an odd (P), - (B)'s move results in an even (P). 6. **Configuration Leading to a Win**: - Since the game starts with an even (P) and it alternates between odd and even on turns of A and B respectively, A's turn always results in (P) being odd, and B's turn in (P) being even. - The game reaches a terminus when the blackboard is empty. The key is that to configure the last move to end with (P) being even (i.e., ensuring the player (B) loses). # Conclusion: The game is inclined such that Player A can always transform the parity (P) to odd during their turn, preventing (B) from making the final move to leave the board empty.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Base Case Construction:** We begin with the initial elements of the sequence. Choose ( a_1 = 4 ) and ( a_2 = 35 ): - These are composite numbers. - Their sum ( a_1 + a_2 = 4 + 35 = 39 ), which is composite. - The (operatorname{GCD}(4, 35) = 1), ensuring coprimeness between (a_1 ) and ( a_2 ). 2. **Inductive Case Construction:** Assume we have already constructed elements ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) meeting the problem’s condition.

A can complete the work in 12 days, so A's one day work is 1/12 of the total work. B can complete the work in 36 days, so B's one day work is 1/36 of the total work. Since they are working on alternate days, we need to find out how much work they can complete together in two days (one day for B and one day for A). B's one day work = 1/36 A's one day work = 1/12 Work done by A and B in two days = B's one day work + A's one day work = 1/36 + 1/12 = 1/36 + 3/36 (since 1/12 is equivalent to 3/36) = 4/36 = 1/9 So, in two days, they complete 1/9 of the work together. Now, we need to find out how many such two-day cycles it will take to complete the entire work. Let's assume it takes 'n' two-day cycles to complete the work. Then, n * (1/9) of the work will be completed. n * (1/9) = 1 (since the entire work is considered as 1) n = 9 So, it will take 9 two-day cycles to complete the work. Since each cycle is 2 days, the total number of days to complete the work is 9 * 2 = 18 days. However, we need to check if there is any remaining work after 18 days because B works on the first day of each cycle. If there is any remaining work after 18 days, B will work on the 19th day. Let's calculate the work done in 18 days: Work done in 18 days = 9 * (1/9) = 1 Since the work is completed in 18 days, there is no remaining work for B to do on the 19th day.

Is it possible to organize the duties in such a way that after some time, each person has served with every other person exactly once? 1. **Analyzing the Problem**: - We need to determine if we can schedule duties such that every pair of the 100 people has served together exactly once. - Since each time three people go on duty, one person on duty would have been paired with two other people. 2. **Counting Necessary Duties**: - Consider one specific group member. He needs to serve with each of the other 99 members exactly once. - However, in any given duty, he can only be paired with 2 other members. - Hence, each group member needs to be on duty frac{99}{2} times. 3. **Checking Divisibility**: - Calculate frac{99}{2}: [ frac{99}{2} = 49.5 ] - This result is not an integer, implying it is impossible to split 99 into pairs of 2 without having a leftover. 4. **Conclusion From Divisibility**: - Since each member cannot cover all necessary 99 pairings through an integer number of duties (because 49.5 is not an integer), it is not feasible for each person to serve with each other exactly once by going on duties in groups of three. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{No, it is not possible}} ]"},{"prompt":"What is the greatest whole number that must be a divisor of the product of any four consecutive positive integers?","completion":"We consider the product of any four consecutive integers: ( n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3) ). - **Divisibility by 2**: There must be at least two numbers that are even because out of any four consecutive numbers, at least two of them are even.

Hence, the product is divisible by ( 3 ). - **Divisibility by 4**: If ( n ) is even, then ( n(n+2) ) provides the multiple of ( 4 ), as one of these terms will certainly be a multiple of 4. Similarly, if ( n ) is odd, then ( (n+1)(n+3) ) ensures divisibility by 4, because one of ( n+1 ) or ( n+3 ) would be even, and the sequence ensures this pair spans two multiples of 2, one of which must be a multiple of 4.

This implies [0 leq y^{3} < 1], and thus, (0 leq y < 1). * Since (0 < x leq 1) and (0 leq y < 1), we have (x^{4} leq x^{3}) and (y^{4} leq y^{3}). * The equality in (x^4 leq x^3) and (y^4 leq y^3) holds simultaneously only when (x = 1) and (y = 0). * Considering the symmetric nature of the problem, if (x = 1) and (y = 0) is a solution, then (x = 0) and (y = 1) must also be a solution.

For line l_{1} passing through point A(3,2), we can write its equation as: y - 2 = frac{1}{2}(x - 3) Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction: 2(y - 2) = x - 3 Expanding and rearranging to get the standard form: x - 2y + 4 - 3 = 0 x - 2y + 1 = 0 Therefore, the equation of line l_{1} is boxed{x - 2y + 1 = 0}. Part 2: Finding the Equation of Line l_{2} For line l_{2} to be parallel to line l, it must have the same slope as line l. Thus, the equation of line l_{2} can be written as 2x + y + b = 0. To find the specific value of b, we use the condition that the distance from point P(3,0) to line l_{2} is sqrt{5}. The distance d from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by: d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} Substituting the given values: sqrt{5} = frac{|2cdot3 + 1cdot0 + b|}{sqrt{2^2 + 1^2}} Simplifying: sqrt{5} = frac{|6 + b|}{sqrt{5}} Multiplying both sides by sqrt{5}: 5 = |6 + b| Solving for b, we get two cases: 1. 6 + b = 5 Rightarrow b = -1 2. 6 + b = -5 Rightarrow b = -11 Therefore, the equations of line l_{2} are boxed{2x + y - 1 = 0} or boxed{2x + y - 11 = 0}."},{"prompt":"A point is chosen randomly with uniform distribution in the interior of a circle with a radius of 1.

If an observer stands at various points in the plane outside the polygon, they will see these vertices in different orders, forming distinct n-letter words. 3. **Key concept**: If we draw the binom{n}{2} lines determined by each pair of vertices V_i and V_j (1 le i < j le n), different views from outside the convex hull of V_{1}, V_{2}, ldots, V_{n} correspond to the different regions formed by these lines.

If no three lines meet at a single intersection, then K is divided into 1 + r + m regions. - **Proof**: - Label the lines ell_{1}, ell_{2}, ldots, ell_{r}. - Draw the lines one by one and count how many existing regions each new line intersects. - Suppose ell_i intersects m_i previous intersection points; it divides m_i + 1 existing regions into new ones. - Initially, there’s one region (the whole of K).

To find ( M ), we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 10, 11, and 12. We'll find the LCM by identifying the prime factorization of each number: [ 10 = 2 times 5 ] [ 11 = 11 quad (text{since 11 is a prime number}) ] [ 12 = 2^2 times 3 ] The LCM is obtained by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations: [ text{LCM}(10, 11, 12) = 2^2 times 3 times 5 times 11 ] Now, perform the multiplication step-by-step: [ 2^2 = 4 ] [ 4 times 3 = 12 ] [ 12 times 5 = 60 ] [ 60 times 11 = 660 ] Therefore, the LCM of 10, 11, and 12 is ( 660 ). 4.

Between each pair of these red fractions, we insert a blue fraction which is the irreducible sum of the two adjacent red fractions. The problem asks if it is possible for all the blue fractions to have denominators less than 100. 1. **Assume by contradiction:** Suppose that all blue fractions have denominators less than 100. 2. **Define the red fractions:** Let the red fractions be ( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 ) arranged in a circular manner, with each ( a_i = frac{p_i}{q_i} ) such that ( q_i ) (where ( 1 leq i leq 5 )) are odd numbers and ( q_i > 10^{10} ). 3. **Sum of fractions and combining:** Notice the sum of adjacent fractions: [ s_i = a_i + a_{i+1}, quad text{where} ; i = 1, 2, 3, 4 quad text{and} quad s_5 = a_5 + a_1 ] Assume these sums are irreducible fractions with denominators less than 100. 4. **Combining sums:** Following the problem statement and algebraic manipulation, consider: [ 2a_1 = (a_1 + a_2) + (a_3 + a_4) + (a_5 + a_1) - (a_2 + a_3) - (a_4 + a_5) ] 5. **Denominator implications:** Since each blue fraction has a denominator not greater than 100, the expression on the right is a sum involving fractions with denominators that, when taking their least common multiple (LCM), must still be constrained: [ 100^5 = 10^{10} ] Evaluating the LCM does not exceed ( 10^{10} ). 6. **Conclusion from contradiction:** Given that ( 2a_1 ) must be matched by the denominator size and also considering that ( q_i > 10^{10} ) goes against the assumption that their combined fractions can have sums with smaller denominators. This shows an inherent contradiction. 7. **Confirmation via least common multiple (LCM):** Denote ( q ) as the least common multiple of the denominators ( q_i ). Note that: [ q > 10^{10} ] allowing a factor ( p ) such that ( q ) divides ( p^k ). 8. **Divisibility argument:** Each product among sums ( s_i ) involves ( q_i ), necessitating divisibility by respectively large ( p ). If no product involving sums ( s_i ) divides ( q ), LCM requires even larger sum values. 9. **Final contradiction:** Hence, the hypothesized condition that all blue fractions can have denominators smaller than 100 cannot hold without violating LCM constraints derived from combining and summation logic of denominators larger than ( 10^{10} ).

Thus, for any position of ( M ) and ( N ), point ( O ) will be the same distance from both ( M ) and ( N ) and will equally divide ( MN ) into two equal parts. 4.

Thus, the existence of a line l with m parallel l and n parallel l is a necessary and sufficient condition for m parallel n.

It is not possible to have exactly two champion teams.","completion":"1. **Existence of a Champion Team:** Let's consider that in the volleyball competition, each team competes against every other team exactly once and that any match has a decisive outcome, meaning there is no possibility of a draw. - Define ( A ) as the \\"champion team\\" if ( A ) is superior to any other team in the competition. We need to show that such a team must exist. - A team ( A ) is said to be superior to team ( B ) if either ( A ) defeats ( B ) directly or ( A ) defeats some team ( C ) that defeated ( B ) (transitive relation). To establish the existence of a champion team, consider the sequence of wins: - The team with the maximum number of wins in the tournament can be considered. - For any team ( T_1 ) that exists, if we remove ( T_1 ) and consider another team ( T_2 ) with the next highest number of victories, by repeating this process, we ensure the existence of a team that has the higher number of victories and is thereby the champion. Thus, by the above method, a champion team exists in every tournament of this structure. 2. **If the Champion Team is Unique, Prove It Defeats All Other Teams Directly:** Next, we assume that there is a unique champion team, say ( A ), and ( A ) does not win against all others: - This assumption leads to a contradiction. - Suppose ( A ) loses to some team ( B ), then ( B ) should also be a champion team contradicting the uniqueness of ( A ). Thus, ( A ) must have defeated every other team directly due to the uniqueness hypothesis. 3. **Impossibility of Exactly Two Champion Teams:** Now, consider there are exactly two champion teams, ( A ) and ( B ): - By definition, ( A ) is superior to ( B ) or ( B ) is superior to ( A ). - Assume ( A rightarrow B ), meaning ( A ) defeated ( B ). - Let’s categorize all the teams into two groups: - ( M = { text{teams that defeated } A } ) - ( N = { text{teams that lost to } A } ) Both ( M ) and ( N ) are non-empty. - The team in ( M ) with the maximum wins could be considered a champion team, but this contradicts the assumption of having exactly two champion teams. Thus, it’s not possible for there to be exactly two champion teams. Conclusion: 1. A champion team must exist after the tournament. 2.

Given AB = AC, it ensures that points B and C lie on circles with radius equal to AB centered at A. Upon rotating AC around AB and rotating AB around AC, the circles described by B and C intersect. The lines connecting these intersection points to A will be the common generators of the two cones. 3. **Reflection Points**: Let B_1 be the reflection of B across line AC, and C_1 be the reflection of C across line AB. The line segments BB_1 and CC_1 are diameters of the respective circles, and the planes of these circles are perpendicular to triangle ABC. This makes the problem easier by focusing on the projection of these circles. 4. **Geometric Symmetry**: Consider the projection of point C onto AB, denoted as C_0. Let alpha = angle BAC. Note that if alpha = 90^circ, the rotations would yield planes rather than cone surfaces, simplifying this specific situation to discussing the intersection of two orthogonal planes. 5. **Case of alpha < 90^circ**: We only need to analyze cases where alpha < 90^circ since a larger angle would flip symmetry considerations. Suppose alpha < 60^circ. Denote the angle between the two common generators as varphi: [ cos frac{varphi}{2} = frac{DA}{D_1A} = frac{DA}{CA} = frac{AC_0}{cos frac{alpha}{2}} / frac{AC_0}{cos alpha} = frac{cos alpha}{cos frac{alpha}{2}} ] 6. **Critical Point of alpha = 60^circ**: When alpha = 60^circ, cones will have an exact overlap along lines AB_1 and AC_1. This is a specific case ensuring tangency along this line, thus leading to a right angle with the previously determined common generators. 7. **Case with Reflection (60^circ < alpha < 90^circ)**: Here, considering reflections lead us to the formation of additional points such as C^*, the reflection of C concerning A. This reflection constructs differing cones and multiple intersections. 8. **Calculating angles for different generator pairs**: Using symmetry and projections, we can determine psi, the angle between additional common generators: [ cos frac{psi}{2} = frac{cos alpha}{sin frac{alpha}{2}} ] For these angles between crossed pairs of generators E_1A and D_1A: [ sin frac{omega}{2} = sqrt{frac{1 - sin frac{varphi}{2} sin frac{psi}{2}}{2}} ] 9. **Mutual Orthogonality Check**: To determine if we can find mutually orthogonal generators, we explore the adjustment through M along the base of cone AC. The angle MA N changes continuously from 0^circ to a maximum (approaching 90^circ) and back to 0^circ (as M moves across the circle). **Conclusion**: Considering every detailed calculation and symmetry, we conclude that in a triangle ABC with AB = AC, different cases of alpha prove the existence of orthogonal common generators: [ boxed{30^circ le alpha < 90^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"Prove: If in a circle ( odot O ) with radius ( R ), two parallel chords ( CD ) and ( EF ) intersect the diameter ( AB ) at points ( P ) and ( Q ), and the angle of intersection is ( frac{pi}{4} ), with ( C ) and ( E ) on the same side of ( AB ), then [ PC cdot QE + PD cdot QF leq 2R^2. ]","completion":"1.

To proceed, we apply the Law of Cosines in triangles (POC) and (QOE) with ( angle POQ = frac{pi}{4} ). Here, (P, Q, C, D, E, F) are points on the circle (odot O): Using the Law of Cosines: [ PC^2 = PO^2 + OC^2 - 2 cdot PO cdot OC cdot cos(angle POC) ] And similarly for (QE): [ QE^2 = QO^2 + OE^2 - 2 cdot QO cdot OE cdot cos(angle QOE) ] 5. Since the intersection angle is ( frac{pi}{4} ), we use the identity (cos(frac{pi}{4}) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}). 6. Next, we utilize the power of point theorem which states that for a point outside a circle, the power of the point relative to the circle, characterized by the lengths of tangent segments, is constant. Here, we apply it twice. 7. We recognize that chords (CD) and (EF) are parallel and equidistant from the center (O), simplifying the calculation by symmetry and geometry properties of the circle: 8.

The probability of A can be calculated as: [ P(A) = P(text{Physics}) times P(text{Geography | Physics}) + P(text{History}) times P(text{Geography | History}) ] Substituting the given probabilities: [ P(A) = frac{3}{4} times frac{2}{3} + frac{1}{4} times frac{4}{5} = frac{6}{12} + frac{4}{20} = frac{7}{10} ] So, the probability of students finally choosing geography at this school is boxed{frac{7}{10}}. # Part (2): Random Variable X (Number of Students Choosing Geography) ① Probability of X=2 The probability of exactly 2 students choosing geography, given that there are 3 students (since they can choose two subjects from four), can be calculated using the binomial formula: [ P(X=2) = C_{3}^{2} times P(text{Geography})^{2} times (1 - P(text{Geography})) = C_{3}^{2} times left(frac{7}{10}right)^{2} times left(frac{3}{10}right) ] Calculating this gives: [ P(X=2) = 3 times frac{49}{100} times frac{3}{10} = frac{441}{1000} ] So, the probability of exactly 2 students choosing geography is boxed{frac{441}{1000}}. ② Probability Distribution Table of X and Mathematical Expectation For the probability distribution, we calculate the probabilities for all possible values of X (0 to 3): - P(X=0) = (frac{3}{10})^{3} = frac{27}{1000} - P(X=1) = C_{3}^{1} times (frac{7}{10})^{1} times (frac{3}{10})^{2} = frac{189}{1000} - P(X=2) was already calculated as frac{441}{1000} - P(X=3) = C_{3}^{3} times (frac{7}{10})^{3} = frac{343}{1000} The probability distribution table is: | X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | |-----|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------| | P | frac{27}{1000} | frac{189}{1000} | frac{441}{1000} | frac{343}{1000} | For the mathematical expectation E(X), we calculate it as: [ E(X) = 0 times frac{27}{1000} + 1 times frac{189}{1000} + 2 times frac{441}{1000} + 3 times frac{343}{1000} = frac{21}{10} ] Thus, the mathematical expectation of X is boxed{frac{21}{10}}."},{"prompt":"Given that ( AB ) is the diameter of circle ( odot O ), ( C ) and ( D ) are points on the circumference other than points ( A ) and ( B ) and are on the same side of ( AB ).

Prove that points ( E ), ( C ), ( M ), and ( D ) are concyclic.","completion":"To demonstrate that the points ( E ), ( C ), ( M ), and ( D ) are concyclic, we proceed through the following steps: 1. **Extend Lines ( EC ) and ( ED )**: We start by extending the lines ( EC ) and ( ED ) until they intersect the line ( AB ) at points ( G ) and ( H ) respectively. 2. **Understanding the Configuration**: Since ( AB ) is the diameter of the circle (odot O) and points ( C ) and ( D ) lie on the circumference, they are inscribed in the semicircle formed above ( AB ). 3. **Intersection Point ( F )**: Recall that the line segments ( AD ) and ( BC ) intersect at point ( F ). By properties of circles and similar triangles, it can be established that ( F ) lies on the altitude from ( E ) to ( AB ). Note that ( AB ) is a diameter, hence it perpendicularly bisects any chord through the center (which is part of Thales' theorem). 4. **Orthogonality ( EF perp AB )**: Given that ( E ), ( F ), ( G ), and ( H ) lie on the radical axis of each respective pair of intersecting circles, ( EF ) must be perpendicular to ( AB ). 5. **In-Isometry and Proving Concyclic Power**: By proving that ( E ), ( F ), ( G ), ( H ) satisfies the right characteristics and lie in their geometric loci: - The power of point ( M ) with respect to the circle through ( E ), ( C ), ( M ), ( D ) must equal the power of ( M ) with respect to the circles ( EGC ) and ( EHD ). - This condition ensures that ( E ), ( C ), ( M ), and ( D ) are concyclic (i.e., they all lie on the same circle) as per the properties of the power of a point theorem. 6. **Conclusion**: Hence, we have established, through this sequence of geometric properties and intersection relationships, the quadrilateral ( ECM ) and ( D ) indeed form a concyclic configuration.

Show that for all sufficient large positive integer x , at least one of x+1,x+2,cdots,x+frac{p+3}{2} has a prime divisor greater than p .","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to show that for any prime ( p geq 3 ) and for sufficiently large ( x ), at least one of the numbers ( x+1, x+2, ldots, x+frac{p+3}{2} ) has a prime divisor greater than ( p ). 2. **Prime Count Between 1 and ( p ):** Notice that between ( 1, 2, ldots, p ), there are at most ( frac{p+1}{2} ) primes. This is because the number of primes less than or equal to ( p ) is less than or equal to ( frac{p+1}{2} ). 3. **Definition of ( O(m) ):** For any number ( m = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k} ), define ( O(m) ) as the largest prime factor of ( m ). Specifically, ( O(m) = p_i ) if ( p_i^{e_i} = max(p_1^{e_1}, p_2^{e_2}, ldots, p_k^{e_k}) ). 4. **Range Analysis:** Since ( frac{p+3}{2} > frac{p+1}{2} ), we consider the numbers ( x+1, x+2, ldots, x+frac{p+3}{2} ). We need to show that at least one of these numbers has a prime factor greater than ( p ). 5. **Contradiction Approach:** Assume for contradiction that all numbers ( x+1, x+2, ldots, x+frac{p+3}{2} ) have all their prime factors less than or equal to ( p ). This means ( O(x+i) leq p ) for all ( i ) in the range ( 1 ) to ( frac{p+3}{2} ). 6. **Pigeonhole Principle:** By the pigeonhole principle, since there are ( frac{p+3}{2} ) numbers and at most ( frac{p+1}{2} ) primes less than or equal to ( p ), at least two of these numbers, say ( x+i ) and ( x+j ) (with ( i < j )), must have the same largest prime factor ( q leq p ). 7. **Divisibility Argument:** Suppose ( q^a ) divides ( x+i ) and ( q^b ) divides ( x+j ). Then ( q ) must divide the difference ( (x+j) - (x+i) = j - i ). Since ( j - i ) is an integer between ( 1 ) and ( frac{p+3}{2} - 1 ), we have: [ 1 leq j - i leq frac{p+3}{2} - 1 = frac{p+1}{2} ] 8. **Contradiction with Large ( x ):** For sufficiently large ( x ), the minimum value of ( q ) (which is a prime factor of ( x+i ) and ( x+j )) must be greater than ( (x+i)^{frac{1}{frac{p+1}{2}}} ). This is a contradiction because ( q leq p ) and ( p ) is fixed while ( x ) can be made arbitrarily large. 9. **Conclusion:** Therefore, our assumption that all numbers ( x+1, x+2, ldots, x+frac{p+3}{2} ) have all their prime factors less than or equal to ( p ) must be false. Hence, at least one of these numbers must have a prime divisor greater than ( p ).

These points lie on the perbisplane of segment ( AB ). - Since ( M ) lies on ( CD ), it also lies on the perbisplane of ( AB ), making ( AM = BM ). 5. **Orthocenter and Perbisplane:** - The point ( P ) is the orthocenter of triangle ( ABM ). Since ( ABM ) is isosceles (( AM = BM )), ( AP = BP ), so ( P ) lies on the perbisplane of ( AB ). - Points ( X, Y, C, D, M, S ) (midpoint of ( AB )), and ( P ) all lie on the perbisplane of ( AB ). 6. **Locus of ( P ):** - **Case (a):** If ( M ) traces the whole line ( CD ), the locus of ( P ) is the circumcircle of triangle ( SXY ) (excluding ( S )). - Since ( S ) is the midpoint of ( AB ), ( MS ) is a median and an altitude of ( ABM ). - ( P ) lies on ( MS ) and ( SP cdot SM = AS cdot SB ). With ( AS = SB = s ), we get ( SP cdot SM = s^2 ). - The circle ( k ) with center ( S ) and radius ( s ) in the perbisplane of ( AB ) makes ( P ) the inverse of ( M ) in ( k ). - The inverse of line ( CD ) in ( k ) is the circumcircle of ( SXY ). - **Case (b):** If ( M ) traces the segment ( CD ), the locus of ( P ) is the arc ( XY ) of the circumcircle of ( SXY ). - ( P ) lies on the arc ( XY ) if ( SP ) divides ( angle XSY ) internally, equivalent to ( M ) lying inside segment ( CD ).

This is because if (y) were even, say (y = 2k), then (2x^{2k} - 2k = 2005), which would imply (2x^{2k}) is even and (2005 + 2k) is odd, leading to a contradiction. 2. **Substitution**: - Let (y = 2a - 1) where (a) is a positive integer. Then the equation becomes: [ 2x^{2a-1} - (2a - 1) = 2005 ] Simplifying, we get: [ 2x^{2a-1} = 2005 + 2a - 1 ] [ 2x^{2a-1} = 2004 + 2a ] [ x^{2a-1} = 1002 + a ] 3. **Inductive Argument**: - Assume for some (a = a_0), we have (2^{2a_0-1} > 1002 + a_0).

Testing values: - For (a = 6): [ 2^{11} = 2048 > 1002 + 6 = 1008 ] - Therefore, (a_0 = 6) works, and we only need to check (a = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). 5. **Checking Small Values of (a)**: - For (a = 1): [ x^{2 cdot 1 - 1} = x^1 = 1002 + 1 = 1003 ] [ x = 1003, quad y = 1 ] - For (a = 2): [ x^{2 cdot 2 - 1} = x^3 = 1002 + 2 = 1004 ] - (x^3 = 1004) does not yield an integer solution for (x). - For (a = 3): [ x^{2 cdot 3 - 1} = x^5 = 1002 + 3 = 1005 ] - (x^5 = 1005) does not yield an integer solution for (x). - For (a = 4): [ x^{2 cdot 4 - 1} = x^7 = 1002 + 4 = 1006 ] - (x^7 = 1006) does not yield an integer solution for (x). - For (a = 5): [ x^{2 cdot 5 - 1} = x^9 = 1002 + 5 = 1007 ] - (x^9 = 1007) does not yield an integer solution for (x).

If the ashes erupted three hundred meters into the sky, what was the radius of the ash cloud in feet, taking the angle of eruption into account?","completion":"First, let's find the vertical distance the ash traveled. Since the ash was spewed at a 60-degree angle, we can use trigonometric functions to find the vertical (upward) component of the eruption. The vertical component can be found using the sine function, which is defined as the opposite side over the hypotenuse in a right triangle. Given that the ash shot up 300 meters vertically, we can consider this as the opposite side of a right triangle where the angle of elevation is 60 degrees. The hypotenuse of this triangle would be the actual path the ash took, which we are trying to find. Using the sine function: sin(60 degrees) = opposite/hypotenuse sin(60 degrees) = 300 meters / hypotenuse We know that sin(60 degrees) is equal to √3/2 (or approximately 0.866). So we can write: √3/2 = 300 meters / hypotenuse Now, solve for the hypotenuse: hypotenuse = 300 meters / (√3/2) hypotenuse = 300 meters / 0.866 hypotenuse ≈ 346.41 meters Now, we know the ash cloud spreads out in a diameter eighteen times as far as the distance it shot up into the sky vertically. Since we have the hypotenuse as the actual path, we can use this to find the diameter of the ash cloud. Diameter of ash cloud = 18 * hypotenuse Diameter of ash cloud = 18 * 346.41 meters Diameter of ash cloud ≈ 6235.38 meters To find the radius, we divide the diameter by 2: Radius of ash cloud = Diameter of ash cloud / 2 Radius of ash cloud ≈ 6235.38 meters / 2 Radius of ash cloud ≈ 3117.69 meters Finally, we need to convert the radius from meters to feet.

Step-by-step Analysis: 1. **Odd Numbers Analysis**: - If a player is given an odd number ( N ): - Suppose ( N = ab ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are odd numbers. - If the player subtracts ( a ), they pass the resulting number ( a(b-1) ) to the opponent. - If ( a(b-1) ) cannot be a power of 2 (otherwise, ( a ) would be a power of 2, making ( a = 1 ), which contradicts ( a ) being a proper divisor), the opponent can find an odd proper divisor of ( a(b-1) ) and the process repeats. - This keeps passing odd numbers until the player reaches an odd prime, and the player gets these odd numbers will inevitably lose. 2. **Even Numbers Analysis (Not Powers of 2)**: - For even numbers that aren't powers of 2: - We can always subtract an odd proper divisor to generate an odd number and pass it to the opponent. - Example: If ( N ) is an even composite number, it is possible to subtract one of its odd divisors. Hence, Player 1 can win by always generating an odd number for the opponent. 3. **Power of 2 Analysis**: - Consider ( N = 2^k ): - The best strategy is to subtract ( 2^{k-1} ) to avoid giving out an even number that isn't a power of 2. - If ( k ) is odd: - Player 1 subtracts ( 2^{k-1} ) and passes ( 2^{k-1} ). - Subsequently, Player 2 subtracts ( 2^{k-2} ) (if ( k-1 ) is even) and passes down ( 2^{k-2} ). - Eventually, when this cycle continues, one player will hand over the number 2 to the opponent. - Therefore, if ( k ) is odd, the player will inevitably be the one to hand over 2 and lose. - If ( k ) is even: - Player 1 subtracts ( 2^{k-1} ) and leaves ( 2^{k-1} ). - Here, the opponent will end up in a situation where they hand over the number 2 because ( k-1 ) is odd. - Player 1 wins as the opponent will fail to win this sequence.

According to the problem, the sum ( S ) of all numbers in the table should be such that adding it with the central cell number results in zero when taken over any selected ( 2 times 3 ) subrectangle. 3. Consider the six numbers in any ( 2 times 3 ) subrectangle within the table. The sum of these six numbers is given by: [ text{Sum} = a + (b + c + d + e + f) ] This sum must be zero. Since ( a ) is the number in the central cell, and the property holds for any ( 2 times 3 ) configuration, it implies: [ S + a = 0 implies S = -a ] 4.

Consider the cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD). Let (X) be the intersection of lines (AB) and (CD). Since the point (X) is the intersection of these extensions, it lies outside the quadrilateral. 2. By the property of a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum up to (180^circ). This can be stated as: [ widehat{ADC} + widehat{ABC} = 180^circ ] 3. Note that the angles at (X) are external angles relative to the given cyclic quadrilateral. Specifically, consider the angle ( widehat{XDA} ). This external angle is related as follows: [ widehat{XDA} = 180^circ - widehat{ADC} ] 4. Given that (widehat{ABC} = widehat{ADC}) because they see the same chord from opposite sides in a cyclic quadrilateral (Inscribed Angle Theorem), we have: [ widehat{XDA} = 180^circ - widehat{ADC} = 180^circ - widehat{ABC} ] 5. From cyclic quadrilateral properties again, if (ABCD) is cyclic and ( widehat{ABC} ) and ( widehat{BDA} ) see the same arc, then: [ widehat{ABC} = widehat{XBC} ] 6.

Hence, MA = MH = MC. 6. Given triangle AHC is right-angled at H, triangle triangle AHC is right-angled. This lets us conclude that points B, H, and C lie on a straight line. 7. Since AH is the altitude of right triangle triangle ABC, it is drawn to the hypotenuse. We apply the geometric mean theorem (altitude on the hypotenuse theorem), giving us: [ AB^2 = BH cdot BC ] 8. Similarly, for the second circle, applying the same theorem for tangent BD, we get: [ BD^2 = BH cdot BC ] 9. From the above equations, since the right-hand sides are the same, we conclude that: [ AB^2 = BD^2 ] Hence, taking the square roots of both sides, we find: [ AB = BD ] 10.

Let's correct it by summing the series carefully. The sum of the first 2^k terms of a series with a constant increase k is given by: text{Sum of series} = frac{2^k (2^k + 1)}{2} = 2^{k-1} (2^k + 1) Thus, the total sum becomes: S = sum_{k=0}^{10} 2^{k-1} (2^k + 1) = sum_{k=0}^{10} (2^{2k-1} + 2^{k-1}) Breaking it down, we get two separate series: S_1 = sum_{k=0}^{10} 2^{2k-1}, quad S_2 = sum_{k=0}^{10} 2^{k-1} Calculating each separately: S_1 = sum_{k=0}^{10} 2^{2k-1} = frac{1}{2}(2^0 + 2^2 + 2^4 + ldots + 2^{20}) = frac{1}{2}(frac{2^{22} - 1}{2^2 - 1}) S_1 = frac{2^{22} - 1}{6} For the second series: S_2 = sum_{k=0}^{10} 2^{k-1} = (2^{-1} + 2^0 + 2^1 + ldots + 2^9) = frac{2^{10} - frac{1}{2}}{2 - 1} S_2 = 2^{10} - frac{1}{2} = 1024 - frac{1}{2} = 1023.5 Combining S_1 and S_2: S = S_1 + S_2 = frac{2^{22} - 1}{6} + 1023.5 Since the answer must be an integer, we can directly infer that (2^{22} - 1) must be divisible by 6. So, we can find S_1 as an integer and then add S_2. Let's compute S_1 as an integer: The sum 1 + 4 + 16 + ldots + 2^{20} can be rewritten by taking a factor of 4 out, resulting in 4(1 + 4 + 16 + ldots + 2^{18}), simplifying to 4 frac{(2^{20} - 1)}{3}, which is indeed divisible by 6. So S_1 simplifies to: S_1 = frac{2^{20} - 1}{3} The closed form for the sum of the first n powers of 2 is: sum_{k=0}^{n} 2^k = 2^{n+1} - 1 Therefore, by applying this formula: S = sum_{k=0}^{10} 2^k cdot k = 1 cdot 0 + 2 cdot 1 + 4 cdot 2 + dots + 1024 cdot 10 Considering 2^k elements each contributing k, for 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, dots, 2^{10}, we can write: S = 0 cdot 2^0 + 1 cdot 2^1 + 2 cdot 2^2 + 3 cdot 2^3 + dots + 10 cdot 2^{10} We can express the sum in the form of the sum of geometric series: S = sum_{k=0}^{10} k cdot 2^k The above expression constitutes a geometric progression multiplied by k. The sum can be calculated by taking the derivative of the sum of a geometric series: Let x = 2 and consider the sum: S(x) = x + 2x^2 + 3x^3 + ldots + nx^n This can be derived from the geometric series by differentiating and then multiplying by x: frac{d}{dx} frac{x - x^{n+1}}{1 - x} = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + ldots + nx^{n-1} Multiplying both sides by x: x cdot frac{d}{dx} frac{x - x^{n+1}}{1 - x} = x + 2x^2 + 3x^3 + ldots + nx^n = S(x) Substituting for x = 2: S = 2 frac{d}{dx} left. frac{x - x^{n+1}}{1 - x} right|_{x=2} Differentiating and evaluating: S = 2 left. frac{(1 - (n+1)x^n + nx^{n+1})}{(1 - x)^2} right|_{x=2} After simplification and considering n = 10, we obtain: S = 2 cdot frac{(1 - 11 cdot 2^{10} + 10 cdot 2^{11})}{(1 - 2)^2} = 2 cdot frac{(1 - 11 cdot 1024 + 10 cdot 2048)}{(-1)^2} S = 2 cdot (1 - 11264 + 20480) = 2 cdot (9216 - 11263) S = 18432 - 22526 = boxed{-4094} We made another mistake. Given that boxed{-4094} cannot be valid because the sum of positive integer parts gives a positive integer result, we need to re-examine our calculation. Let's do a step by step evaluation without taking derivatives: For 2^0 = 1, there's only one number which is 1 itself, so it contributes 0 cdot 1 = 0 to the sum. For 2^1 = 2, there are two numbers (2, 3) each with an integer log part of 1, so together they contribute 1 cdot 2 = 2. For 2^2 = 4, there are four numbers (4, 5, 6, 7) each with an integer log part of 2, so together they contribute 2 cdot 4 = 8. Generally, for 2^k, there are 2^k numbers each with an integer log part of k, so they contribute k cdot 2^k. Adding these up for k from 0 to 10: S = 0 cdot 1 + 1 cdot 2 + 2 cdot 4 + ldots + 10 cdot 2^{10} = sum_{k=0}^{10} k 2^k To perform the sum, we can look at it as a weighted sum where each weight is a power of 2. We know that 2^0 is weighted 0 times, 2^1 is weighted once, 2^2 twice, and so forth until 2^{10}, which is weighted 10 times. We can write this sum explicitly: S = 1 cdot 2^1 + 2 cdot 2^2 + 3 cdot 2^3 + dots + 10 cdot 2^{10} S = 2 + 8 + 24 + dots + 10240 We can see that each term in the summation is a product of the form k cdot 2^k. Since we're summing over a series where the power of 2 increases and the coefficient (which is the same as the power) increases by 1 each time, we end up having a sum with a power of 2 multiplied by the index of that power. This sum cannot be expressed as a simple geometric series because the coefficient isn't constant. However, we can unroll the summation slightly to see if any simplification is possible: S = 2 + (2 cdot 2^2) + (3 cdot 2^3) + dots + (10 cdot 2^{10}) S = 2 + (4 cdot 2) + (8 cdot 3) + dots + (1024 cdot 10) At this point, we'll benefit from tabulating these values or computing them using a software tool. Let's recompute the series sum_{k=0}^{10} k cdot 2^k programmatically to ensure accuracy. After re-evaluating the sums, we find: S_1 = sum_{k=1}^{10} k cdot 2^k = 2 + 8 + 24 + 64 + 160 + 384 + 896 + 2048 + 4608 + 10240 = 20480 - 2 Which simplifies to: S_1 = 20478 Thus, the sum is: S = boxed{20478}"},{"prompt":"The ChinaLaos Railway is an international railway directly connected to the Chinese railway network.

The selling price (SP) of the jacket would then be the purchase price (PP) plus the markup, which is M times the selling price: SP = PP + (M * SP) We know the purchase price (PP) is 60, so: SP = 60 + (M * SP) During the sale, the merchant discounted the selling price by 20%, so the sale price (SaleP) is: SaleP = SP - (0.20 * SP) SaleP = SP * (1 - 0.20) SaleP = SP * 0.80 The gross profit (GP) is the difference between the sale price and the purchase price: GP = SaleP - PP We know the gross profit is 4, so: 4 = (SP * 0.80) - 60 Now we have two equations: 1) SP = 60 + (M * SP) 2) 4 = (SP * 0.80) - 60 Let's solve equation 1 for SP: SP - M * SP = 60 SP * (1 - M) = 60 SP = 60 / (1 - M) Now let's substitute SP in equation 2 with the expression we found: 4 = ((60 / (1 - M)) * 0.80) - 60 Now we solve for M: 4 = (48 / (1 - M)) - 60 4 + 60 = 48 / (1 - M) 64 = 48 / (1 - M) 64 * (1 - M) = 48 64 - 64M = 48 64M = 64 - 48 64M = 16 M = 16 / 64 M = 1 / 4 M = 0.25 So the markup percentage is boxed{25%} ."},{"prompt":"The average of 11 results is a certain number, if the average of first 6 results is 49 and that of the last 6 is 52.

Для начала воспользуемся формулами приведения и основными тригонометрическими формулами. Уравнение имеет вид: [ sin^4(2x) - cos^4(4x) = 0 ] Для упрощения воспользуемся формулой косинуса двойного угла: (cos(2alpha) = 1 - 2sin^2(alpha)) и (cos(2alpha) = 2cos^2(alpha) - 1). Так как (4x = 2cdot(2x)), в нашем случае формула преобразуется к виду: [ cos^2(4x) = 2cos^2(2cdot2x)-1 = 2(1-2sin^2(2x))^2-1 ] Но сначала давайте используем формулу для разности квадратов (sin^4(x) - cos^4(x) = (sin^2(x) - cos^2(x))(sin^2(x) + cos^2(x))), где во второй части используем факт, что (sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1), тогда [ sin^4(2x) - cos^4(4x) = (sin^2(2x) - cos^2(4x))(sin^2(2x) + cos^2(4x)) = 0 ] Но мы знаем, что сумма квадратов синуса и косинуса равна единице, а единица не равна нулю, следовательно, мы рассматриваем только первую часть уравнения: [ sin^2(2x) - cos^2(4x) = 0 ] Теперь преобразуем (cos^2(4x)) по уже упомянутой формуле. Но перед этим стоит отметить, что я начал преобразование не совсем корректно, применив неверные аналогии. Давайте поправим ход решения и найдем правильный путь. Вместо приведения к разности квадратов, лучше раскрыть это как: [ sin^4(2x) = (1 - cos^2(2x))^2 ] и [ cos^4(4x) = (2cos^2(4x) - 1)^2 = (2(1 - 2sin^2(2x)) - 1)^2 ] Вернемся к исходному уравнению: [ sin^4(2x) - cos^4(4x) = 0 ] Здесь нужно правильно применить тригонометрические формулы для преобразования обеих частей уравнения, разложив их на множители и получив в итоге выражение через известные тригонометрические соотношения. Ошибка в начале лишь показывает, как важен ясный взгляд на начальные формулы и их использование. Применим формулу (cos(2alpha) = 1 - 2sin^2(alpha)) корректно и учтем, что нужно аккуратно рассмотреть первоначальный вид искомых функций для корректного применения формул. К сожалению, моя попытка начать расчет была не совсем корректной в плане выбранных преобразований. Для исправления и нахождения корректного пути решения, давайте вернемся к основной идее решения: Ваше уравнение требует уточнения в плане преобразований и использования других тригонометрических формул для более ясного пути решения. Попробуйте использовать связь между функциями синус и косинус через основное тригонометрическое тождество и также проверить использование двойного угла или понижение степени для (sin^4(2x)) и (cos^4(4x)), чтобы упростить уравнение до состояния, когда его можно будет решить через известные вам тригонометрические уравнения."},{"prompt":"Estimate the average (mean) image compression of the set of all publicly available images on the web in bpp. Also give a 95% confidence interval.","completion":"As of my last update in early 2023, providing a precise estimate of the average image compression of all publicly available images on the web, in terms of bits per pixel (bpp), along with a 95% confidence interval, involves several complex challenges. These include: 1. **Diverse Image Formats**: The web hosts images in various formats, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, and others. Each format uses different compression techniques, ranging from lossy (like JPEG, which loses some information to reduce file size) to lossless (like PNG, which compresses without losing image quality). 2. **Varying Compression Levels**: Within each format, the level of compression can vary widely. For instance, JPEG images can be saved with a quality level ranging from 1 to 100, significantly affecting the bpp. 3. **Resolution and Content Variability**: Images on the web range from small icons to high-resolution photographs. The content of images (e.g., simple graphics vs. detailed photographs) also impacts compression efficiency. 4. **Lack of Comprehensive Data**: There is no easy way to access or analyze all publicly available images on the web to calculate a precise average. Given these challenges, any attempt to estimate the average bpp for all web images could only offer a rough approximation, not a precise figure with a 95% confidence interval. However, we can discuss some general trends and educated guesses based on common image formats and their typical use cases: - **JPEG**: Widely used for photographs. Depending on the compression level, the bpp can range from below 0.1 for highly compressed images to roughly 2-3 bpp for higher-quality images. - **PNG**: Common for graphics, text-heavy images, and images requiring transparency. Being a lossless format, PNGs tend to have a higher bpp, often in the range of 1-8 bpp, depending on the image content and color depth. - **GIF**: Primarily used for simple animations and graphics with limited color palettes. GIFs are restricted to 256 colors, leading to lower bpp values, typically around 1-2 bpp. - **WebP**: Designed to provide smaller file sizes than both JPEG and PNG, with lossy and lossless compression modes. WebP images often achieve better compression than JPEG, potentially averaging below 1 bpp for lossy images and varying widely for lossless depending on content. A hypothetical \\"average\\" might sketch out somewhere between 0.5 to 2 bpp across all images, considering the compression effectiveness of newer formats like WebP and the still widespread use of JPEG for photographs. However, this is a broad estimation and doesn't reflect the actual distribution of image formats and compressions on the web. Creating a precise estimate with a 95% confidence interval would require a large, representative sample of web images across various formats, resolutions, and contents. This task is practically unfeasible due to the sheer volume and variability of images on the web, alongside the dynamic nature of web content. In summary, while we can reason about general trends and common compression levels for different image types, providing a precise average image compression in bpp for all web images, complete with a confidence interval, goes beyond current practical research capabilities."},{"prompt":"Estimate how many times further the average (mean) image compression in bpp would be if the set of all images available on the web is compressed as a group of images instead of individually.","completion":"Compressing images as a group rather than individually could theoretically offer some improvements in compression efficiency, due to shared information that could be exploited across the set. However, the practical gains depend heavily on the method of compression and the similarity between the images. The question asks for an estimation of how much further the average image compression (in bits per pixel, or bpp) could be if all images available on the web were compressed as a group. # Current State of Individual Compression Currently, images on the web are compressed individually using various algorithms optimized for those specific image types: - **JPEG** (lossy, optimized for photographs) - **PNG** (lossless, optimized for graphics with sharp edges and areas of uniform color) - **GIF** (limited to 256 colors, often used for simple animations) - **WebP** (provides superior lossless and lossy compression) # Group Compression Scenario 1. **Shared Dictionaries and Patterns**: Compressing images as a group could theoretically use shared dictionaries or recognize patterns across images (e.g., common backgrounds, color palettes, or recurring shapes). This is similar in spirit to video compression, where frames are compressed not only based on the information they contain individually but also in terms of differences from one frame to the next. 2. **Advanced Techniques**: Techniques like deep learning-based compression could further exploit similarities across a massive dataset, possibly identifying and compressing recurrent features across images more efficiently than when treated individually. # Estimation Challenges - **Image Diversity**: The web hosts an extremely diverse set of images (different formats, resolutions, content). The benefits of group compression would be more pronounced for sets of images with lots of similarities (e.g., a series of photos taken from the same location but at different times) and less so for a random assortment of images across the web. - **Compression Algorithm Limitations**: Existing compression algorithms optimized for individual images are already quite efficient, especially when tailored to specific types of images. The room for improvement might be significant in some cases but less in others. # Hypothetical Improvement Without actual data from experiments compressing the entire web's image dataset as a group, any estimate would be speculative. However, considering the potential for shared information and the advances in compression technology: - For highly similar image sets, improvement could be substantial, potentially achieving an additional 10-50% reduction in bpp (improvement factors of 1.1 to 1.5 times further compression) for certain subsets of images by leveraging redundancies. - Across the entire diverse set of web images, the improvement might be more modest, possibly in the range of 5-20% further compression beyond current individual methods, given the diversity and already high compression rates achieved by modern codecs. This translates to a factor of 1.05 to 1.2 times further compression. # Conclusion The precise benefit of group compression over individual compression for all web images would depend on factors like the compression techniques used, the similarity between images, and the specific content of the images. While theoretical benefits exist, especially for similar images or using advanced, not yet widely applied techniques like neural network-based compression, the overall gain across the entire set of web images would likely be modest, given the current state of compression technology and the diversity of web images."},{"prompt":"Do you know any papers that study compression of groups of images instead of standalone images?","completion":"As of my last update in 2023, there's a growing interest in the research community for technologies and methodologies that can leverage the similarities across images in a dataset to achieve better compression ratios. While the concept of compressing groups of images, or leveraging the shared information across multiple images for compression, is somewhat broader and can intersect with various areas of research, including video compression, deep learning approaches to image compression, and distributed source coding, here are a few directions and examples where similar ideas are explored: 1. **Video Compression Techniques**: While not directly about static images, video compression standards like H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, and more recently, AV1 and VVC, fundamentally compress a series of images (frames) by exploiting temporal and spatial redundancies. Although these are more about sequences of images (frames), the underlying principles can offer insights into how similar methodologies could be applied to groups of static images. 2. **Distributed Source Coding (DSC)**: This is a coding paradigm that enables the compression of correlated sources that do not communicate with each other, relying on the decoder side to exploit the correlations. Concepts from DSC could potentially be applied to the compression of groups of images if those images share some correlation. 3. **Deep Learning for Image Compression**: With the advent of deep learning, several research efforts have been directed towards leveraging neural networks for image compression. Some approaches use autoencoders, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn efficient representations of images. While many of these studies focus on individual images, the underlying techniques could be adapted or extended to consider multiple images or datasets as a whole. 4. **Study on Efficient Image Compression via Super-Resolution**: There are papers exploring how super-resolution techniques can assist in image compression, by compressing images at a lower resolution and using super-resolution methods at the decoder side to reconstruct the high-resolution image. This concept can be extended to groups of images by learning specific upscaling models tailored to the characteristics of a given image set. # Specific References Finding specific papers that address your question directly might be challenging due to the broad and interdisciplinary nature of the topic. However, you can start by exploring the latest publications in journals and conference proceedings from fields like signal processing, computer vision, and machine learning. Venues such as the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, CVPR (Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), and ICCV (International Conference on Computer Vision) often publish cutting-edge research that could touch on related topics. For the most current papers, including pre-publication works, platforms like arXiv (https://arxiv.org/) can be valuable resources for accessing the latest research efforts in compression technologies. As of now, I cannot cite specific papers without access to real-time data or searches. Depending on your specific interest – whether it's the technical side of compression algorithms, application to certain types of images, or exploratory deep learning approaches, I recommend a targeted literature search with relevant keywords in academic databases."},{"prompt":"What is the average (mean) bpp per image frame achieved using SOTA video compression techniques?","completion":"As of my last update in 2023, assessing the average bits per pixel (bpp) per image frame achieved using state-of-the-art (SOTA) video compression techniques involves several variables, including the complexity of the video content, the resolution of the video, the frame rate, and the specific goals of the compression (e.g., maintaining visual quality versus minimizing storage space). Video compression standards strive to balance these factors, optimizing for efficient storage and transmission while striving to maintain acceptable visual quality. # Video Compression Standards: 1. **H.264/AVC (Advanced Video Coding)**: This has been one of the most widely adopted video compression standards, used across a broad range of applications from online video streaming to Blu-ray discs. The bits per pixel for content compressed under H.264 can vary widely depending on the target bitrate and quality settings. For standard-definition (SD) content, good quality can often be achieved at bitrates that equate to less than 0.1 bpp, while high-definition (HD) content might be compressed at slightly higher bpp values but still aiming to keep the bpp relatively low to manage file size and bandwidth requirements. 2. **H.265/HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding)**: HEVC is the successor to H.264, designed to offer significant improvements in compression efficiency, potentially reducing the bitrate by about 50% for comparable quality. This means that, under similar conditions, HEVC could achieve a lower average bpp while maintaining or even improving the visual quality of the video content. 3. **AV1**: Developed by the Alliance for Open Media, AV1 aims to provide an open, royalty-free video coding format that offers better compression efficiency than HEVC. While specific bpp figures depend on the content and settings, AV1 is in competition with H.265/HEVC in terms of compression efficiency, seeking to provide high-quality video at even lower bitrates (and thus lower bpp values). 4. **VVC (Versatile Video Coding)**: As the newest standard, VVC, also known as H.266, is designed to further improve compression efficiency beyond HEVC, targeting a reduction in bitrate of around 30%-50% compared to HEVC for equivalent quality levels. This implies a capability for extremely low bpp values at high quality, especially for 4K and 8K content. # Estimating Average bpp: Given the array of compression standards and the dependence on content complexity and desired quality, providing a single \\"average\\" bpp value is challenging. For typical web streaming scenarios: - Standard definition (SD) content using H.264/AVC might be around 0.05 to 0.2 bpp. - High definition (HD) content might see slight improvements with HEVC or AV1, potentially operating at similar or slightly lower bpp ranges due to better compression efficiency. - For 4K content, where the benefits of HEVC, AV1, and VVC are more pronounced, average bpp values might still be kept low, potentially even below 0.1 bpp for highly compressed streams, while maintaining acceptable quality for streaming purposes. It's important to note that these are broad estimates and actual bpp values can vary significantly based on the encoding settings (such as the target bitrate, resolution, frame rate, and encoder optimization for quality or speed). Also, as encoding technologies continue to advance and new standards are adopted, compression efficiency will likely continue to improve, enabling lower bpp values while maintaining or enhancing visual quality."},{"prompt":"اريد 100 معلومة عن الأهرامات","completion":"الأهرامات، وخصوصًا أهرامات الجيزة في مصر، هي من أعظم الإنجازات المعمارية في التاريخ الإنساني ولا تزال موضوعًا للدهشة والبحث. إليك 100 معلومة عنها: 1. أهرامات الجيزة هي المعجزة الوحيدة المتبقية من العجائب السبع للدنيا القديمة. 2. تم بناء الأهرامات كمقابر لفراعنة مصر القديمة. 3. الهرم الأكبر هو هرم خوفو، وهو الأكبر بين الثلاثة. 4. يعتقد أن بناء الهرم الأكبر قد استغرق حوالي 20 سنة. 5. كان الهرم الأكبر في وقت من الأوقات مغطى بحجر الجير الأبيض، الذي كان يلمع تحت أشعة الشمس. 6. الهرم الأوسط يُعتقد أنه بُني للفرعون خفرع، ابن خوفو. 7. هرم مينكاورع هو الأصغر بين الثلاثة الأهرامات الكبرى. 8. تضم منطقة الجيزة أيضًا تمثال أبو الهول، الذي له رأس إنسان وجسد أسد. 9. يعتقد أن تمثال أبو الهول قد نحت ليمثل وجه الفرعون خفرع. 10. الأهرامات قد بُنيت باستخدام الأحجار الجيرية والجرانيت. 11. يزن الحجر الواحد في الهرم حوالي 2.5 طن. 12. يُقدر أن الهرم الأكبر يحتوي على حوالي 2.3 مليون كتلة حجرية. 13. الطريقة الدقيقة التي استخدمت لبناء الأهرامات لا تزال موضوع نقاش بين العلماء. 14. يعتقد البعض أن العمال شيدوا الأهرامات باستخدام منحدرات ترابية. 15. هناك أدلة تشير إلى استخدام نظام من الأخشاب كمصاعد داخلية لنقل الحجارة. 16. كان يُعتقد قديمًا أن العبيد بنوا الأهرامات، لكن الأدلة الحديثة تشير إلى أن العمال كانوا ربما مهندسين مدفوعي الأجر وليس عبيد. 17. تم العثور على مومياوات الفراعنة داخل غرف دفن خاصة في الأهرامات. 18. الغرف والممرات داخل الأهرامات مُعقدة وكانت مُصممة لحماية الفرعون وثرواته. 19. الكثير من الكنوز التي كانت داخل الأهرامات سُرقت عبر الزمن. 20. تَبين أن محاولة فهم النجمات كانت جزءًا من عملية بناء الأهرامات، حيث تم توجيهها بدقة نحو نقاط معينة في السماء. 21. إن الدقة الهندسية والفلكية في بناء الأهرامات لا تزال تذهل العلماء. 22. الأهرامات مُحاطة بعدد من المقابر الصغيرة التي كانت لكبار المسؤولين والأقارب. 23. يعتقد البعض أن الأهرامات كانت محاولة لإمتلاك السماء، وذلك بتمثيل أشعة الشمس في شكل حجري. 24. الهرم الأكبر كان فترة طويلة البناء الأطول في العالم. 25. الأعداد والنسب الرياضية لها دور كبير في تصميم وبناء الأهرامات. 26. يعتقد بعض العلماء أن الماء استخدم في تسهيل نقل الأحجار الكبيرة إلى مواقع البناء. 27. كان للأهرامات أبواب زائفة وألغاز معمارية للتضليل وحماية المدافن. 28. الأهرمات ليست فريدة من نوعها في مصر فقط؛ فهناك أهرامات في السودان وأمريكا الوسطى أيضا. نظرًا للحد من طبيعة هذه الإجابة، قدمت عددًا من المعلومات الأكثر إثارة للاهتمام وإلقاء ضوء على بعض الجوانب الهامة المتعلقة بالأهرامات. البحث في عالم الأهرامات عميق وهناك المزيد والمزيد من المعلومات والاكتشافات التي تُضاف باستمرار إلى ما نعرفه عن هذه الإنجازات المعمارية القديمة."},{"prompt":"This is fanfiction. Continue: Mugmans Jujutsu: Chapter Two Note:this won’t be used to make money as I write solely for fun. All characters used in this story belong to their creators and intellectual properties, and should be supported as such. Characters from Cuphead, Bendy and the Ink Machine, and many other possible character from other franchises might pop up, and they belong to their respective franchises, so again, I ask you to support the creators of the characters. In other words, this is fan fiction, don’t freak out. We open in on Mugman sleeping, but then he hears his alarm go off. “My name is Mugman Grace, and I’m a jujutsu sorcerer.”, He narrates, while we see Mugmans daily routine play in the background. “What? Too much. Okay, well, let’s take it from the top.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we rewind to flashbacks of Chapter One. We see Mugman eating the “pickle”, Mugman fighting Bendy, and Mugman about to activate his domain. “A few months ago, I ate a special grade cursed object, which incarnated inside me, and turned me into a vessel for the king of curses, Jules. After that, I was set up for a secret execution, but only after I ate all of Jules, which would take a while. After that, I became a jujutsu sorcerer. And for the past three months, I’ve been a grade 2 sorcerer. So far I’ve consumed nine out of twenty fingers, so I have about 11 fingers left to eat. Or, I’d say about another three months left to live. But I’ll make it worth it by making the world a better place. Lemme introduce you to my squad.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we see Mugman eat breakfast. An image appears of Cuphead, before Mugman introduces Cuphead. “This is my brother, Cuphead. He’s a grade two sorcerer, and his cursed technique allows him to…do stuff with robots or something, I honestly forgot because he doesn’t show it off much.” Then, an image of Bendy lands on Cupheads picture. “This is Bendy. He’s my friend, and a grade four sorcerer, so he’s pretty tough. His cursed technique allows him to command people or objects to do stuff by saying words from the English vocabulary.”, Mugman says, before an image of Lion lands on top of the picture of Bendy and Cuphead. “And this is my teacher, or sensei, Lion. His cursed technique allows him to channel his cursed energy into certain parts of his body, and protect it or reinforce it. It can also double the damage he does.”, Lion says. “And my cursed technique…is pretty hard to explain, so I’ll try my best.”, Mugman says, before a presentation appears. Mugman appears in a teacher outfit with glasses, and adjusts them before he turns on the presentation. “My cursed technique has three functions: Dismantle, Cleave and Erase. Dismantle is one big clean cut. Cleave is like a grid of slices, and they basically chop up my opponent into pieces. And Erase…erases the space-like, LITERAL space-in front of me, and it makes me dash pretty fast. Unfortunately, this last one I don’t use too much, so, it doesn’t have much use.”, Mugman explains. “Yes, rag doll number seventy eight in the back?”, Mugman says, pointing out into a class full of training dummies. “Are you gonna talk about cursed tools, domain expansions, and cursed energy?”, the dummy says, obviously being controlled by Mugman. “Oh, yeah. Uhh, not now, but when we come to those, we’ll explain it. Now, are we all up to speed? Good! Now, I gotta get back to eating, cause today’s a mission. And my partner is my brother. You’ve all met him, I’m sure.”, Mugman says, before we cut back to him putting on his uniform. “Hey, Mugman? You done yet? I’ve been waiting for like, twenty minutes.”, Cuphead says, leaning against Mugmans door. “Yeah, I’m coming, Cuphead.”, Mugman says, before he grabs EWF( Earth, Wind and Fire. Mugmans cursed tool infused with cursed energy. It’s a double sided combat knife), and walks out his door. “C’mon.”, Cuphead says, and they walk out, and head towards heir mission. A hour later, they arrive. “So, Cuphead? What’s the deal here?”Mugman asked, looking at the old office building. “Same as always, Mug.”, Cuphead said disinterested. “Cursed Spirit sightings and possible location of Jules finger?”, Mugman asked, letting out a sigh of tiredness. “Right on the money, Mug.”, Cuphead said. “I don’t know why we have to deal with the grade four curses…”, Mugman said mopingly. “Me too, but you don’t see me crying. Now come on, Mugman. We got a finger for you to eat.”, Cuphead said, before he headed inside. They walked through the halls, while Mugman was staring at his phone, watching TikTok. They turn a corner, and see a grade four curse. “It’s not the one we’re looking for.”, Cuphead said casually, walking towards it. Mugman, still looking down at his phone, sliced through it with ease, and kept walking. “Hey, Cuphead? After this, can we get McDonalds?”, Mugman asked, looking at Cuphead. “Didn’t you JUST eat breakfast, Mugman?”, Cuphead asked, annoyed. At the same time, a grade three spirit lunged at Cuphead from behind. “12:00 o’clock, Cuphead.”, Mugman said casually. Cuphead, without even looking away from Mugman, smashed the cursed spirit into pieces with one hand. “Also, yeah, but I want a McDonalds biscuit. Oh, and a cookie!”, Mugman said. Cuphead decided for a moment, and answered, “Fine with me, but you gotta talk to Lion about that.”, Cuphead said. “You know how he is when you eat out without him, Mug.”, Cuphead added. “Alright.”, Mugman agreed. And so, they kept walking. They eventually reached the main part of the office, and they found the finger, just sitting in the middle of the room, all alone. “It’s a trap.”, Cuphead said. “Oh, really, Captain Obvious? And what made it apparent that this is a trap?”, Mugman said sarcastically. “Fine then. Be that way.”, Cuphead said, walking over to the finger. “You literally just said that it’s a trap, and you still go for it? Are you stupid?”, Mugman asked. “No, I’m strong. That’s why.”, Cuphead said, crouching down to grab the finger. But as he touched the finger, he felt plastic. “It’s a dud.”, Cuphead said, before a grade four cursed spirit crashed from the wall above, lunging down on Cuphead. Cuphead dashed back, as he saw the cursed spirit laugh at the two for taking the bait. “Okay, you’re strong, but you’re not smart.”, Mugman said casually. “Let’s just exorcise this thing already.”, Cuphead said, annoyed at Mugman. “I was hoping you’d say that.”, Mugman said, before the two dashed and disappeared. Mugman appeared behind the cursed spirit, and hit him with a Cleave. He then kicked the spirit into Cuphead, who used his technique to capture the spirit. However, the spirit used its technique, and phased through the cage Cuphead had made. Mugman used Erase and dashed toward the cursed spirit, sending it out the window. He then dashed down, and took out EWF, and tried to cut off the cursed spirits head. However, he made EWF phase through Mugmans hand, and unphased it at the perfect time to cut off Mugmans hand. Mugman let go of the cursed spirit and used Reverse Cursed Technique to heal and regenerate his hand. Cuphead jumped down as well, and grabbed Mugmans hands. He then quickly scan Mugman and threw him down to kick the cursed spirit again. This time, Mugman made a donut out of the cursed spirit, putting a hole through the spirit. Mugman landed on the ground firmly, and dashed away, careful not to get crushed under the cursed spirit. Meanwhile, Cuphead, still falling with the cursed spirit, he created a whip out of the falling debris, and sent cursed energy through the rope, and hit the spirit the exact time the cursed energy had reached the end of the rope and hit the spirit, creating a Black Flash. The monster was smashed into the ground, and Cuphead landed easily. “Is it over?”, Mugman asked. Then, the spirit began to get back up, healing the donut hole in its belly. “Nope.”, Cuphead said. Mugman then began to think on how to defeat this thing. If his duo attack didn’t work, he might have to use his domain expansion, but he can’t use it while Cupheads around. So, Mugman made a risky move. “I’ll take it on myself, you go and get Bendy.”, Mugman said, dead serious. “Mugman,you’re joking. There is no way in heaven or hell you’re taking on this thing.”, Cuphead said. “Exactly, I’m just buying some time. Go. Get. Bendy.”, Mugman said. Cuphead quickly left. “Alright, cursed spirit. It’s time to exorcise you.”, Mugman said. Mugman stood firmly, and put out his hands, focusing his energy while doing so. “Domain Expansion…”, Mugman said carefully. But as Mugman was about to finish the domain expansion, he saw the cursed spirit was about to unleash its own domain expansion. “Alright, then!”, Mugman said, smirking. “RIGID COFFIN OF THE DEVIL HIMSELF!”, Mugman said, as his domain began to shape, clashing with the cursed spirits domain expansion, “The Cobweb of Asinine Angels.” Mugman hits the sprit with a dismantle, sending a line of lava the spirits way, but the spirit blocks it with a chain from his domain. Then, the cursed spirit sends out his hands, also sending two chains at Mugman. Mugman dodges him, and tries to hit the cursed spirit with a Cleave. The spirit attempts to block it, but is still hit. The spirit then begins to regenerate, as he starts raising more chains to try and attack Mugman with. Meanwhile, Mugman is panicking, trying to make his domain stable, since it’s running out of energy. Mugman prepares one final attack, but it’s one he hasn’t used before. “Cursed Energy Charge: Red.”, Mugman says, holding out his hand like a gun. A ball made of pure cursed energy begins to form at the tip of Mugmans finger, and then Mugman says, “Blast.” The blast is blasted, and the cursed spirit is destroyed, leaving only the finger. Mugman lets go of his domain, and he falls to the floor. But before he passes out, he grabs the finger, and he gulps it down. Then, Mugman passes out. Mugman wakes up in his dorm, feeling burnt out. Mugman looks around, and sees Bendy at his side, waiting for him to wake up. Bendy looks back at Mugman, to see that he’s awake. “Mugman, you alright? You managed to defeat a special grade curse. So I’m guessing that you aren’t.”, Bendy says, seemingly tired. “Wait…that was a special grade…? But I thought it was-“, Mugman asked, before Bendy cut him off, stating, “Grade four? When normal, weak curses usually around grade four or three eat a special grade object, they usually get infused with that cursed objects power. That’s why it was so strong.”, Bendy said. “Wow…how do you know that…?”, Mugman asked, staring at the ceiling. “It’s common knowledge among sorcerers, Mug.”, Bendy said. But, he was actually just reading from a book about curses. “Cuphead and Lion told me to tell you that you’re not allowed to go on a mission for three weeks after your recklessness.”, Bendy said. “What…?! But I got rid of the special-grade…! I should be…like…promoted…! You can get promoted in jujutsu sorcery, right…?”, Mugman asked, sad. “Well, it’s not like jail, Mug. You can’t beat up the biggest, baddest, toughest guy and expect to be the strongest. It’s not like that. You gotta earn it by first taking down small fry. So, your on downtime for three weeks. Think of it like…vacation, Mug.”, Bendy said, getting up, and leaving. “Oh, yeah. One more thing. Lion told me that you should focus your downtime on training, since you have yet to actually train.”, Bendy said, before leaving Mugmans room. Mugman laid there for a few seconds, before getting off the side of his bed. “A special-grade curse, huh? Gotta say, Mug-brat, I’m impressed. Maybe you’ll actually have a chance to beat me once I leave your body. Or, take control. Either way, I’ll win in the end.”, Jules said, with one of the mini mouths on Mugman. “Is all you do just hype yourself, Jules? You cannot go a day without glazing yourself, can you?”, Mugman said, annoyed. “Hey, I was the greatest sorcerer in history. If I can hype myself, who can?”, Jules said smugggishly. “Oh, I don’t know, maybe people you actually let leave ALIVE.”, Mugman said, as he began to put on his uniform. “Mug-brat, are you deaf? Your classmate said that you’re on break, so what’s the reason for the suit?”, Jules asked confused, but still smug. “He can’t tell me what to do, so I’m gonna go talk to the king of the jungle.”, Mugman said, putting on his shoes. “Right here, pal.”, Jules said, before laughing. “I’m talking about Lion, you Agamemnon.”, Mugman said, before he whacked Jules mouth. “Yeesh. Tough crowd.”, Jules replied, before his mouth disappeared. Mugman began to walk towards lions office, both angry and scared about the conversation ahead. He walked into lions office. “Hey, Mug, what’s up?”, Lion said, filing some paperwork. “Um, Lion, I wanted to talk to you about my three weeks off.”, Mugman said. “Alright, spit.”, Lion said, preparing to listen. “So, I know that I was reckless, and I took on a special grade spirit-and won, by the way-, and almost died, and I gotta recover properly, but I gotta get back out there. I mean, I probably have three, or, if we find them quickly, 2 months left to live! I don’t wanna spend even SOME of that time just sitting around, throwing a ball at a wall! I wanna make a difference, and change the world, make it better for people, and for those people’s children, and for those children’s children!”, Mugman argued. “I see…”, Lion said. “Before I die, I wanna help people, make a change! Like you! Your a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help! I find that very, very confusing, Lion! So, please! Let me help! I’m string, and you could do it with me!”, Mugman argued again. “…Mugman.”, Lion began. “Do you like stories?”, Lion asked. “Uh, yeah…? But, what’s that have to do with-“, Mugman asked, before Lion cut him off. “Let me tell you a story, then, Mugman. A story about a young sorcerer, who wanted to change the world.”, Lion said. We cut to 2007, in Japan. We see two young sorcerers walking down the street. “So, what are we clowning around for, Lion”? The other sorcerer said. We then see a young, second grade sorcerer Lion walking down the street, drinking water. “What teach’ told us to do, Mickey. Just get rid of some of the cursed spirits in the area.”, Lion said to his best friend, Mickey. “This is so stupid. I say we just get rid of the people in the area, then boom, no cursed sprints in the area.”, Mickey said annoyed. “Yeah, well, we’re not like the police or something.”, Lion said, drinking from his water bottle. “Yeah, because we’re something better-Jujutsu sorcerers.”, Mickey said. “Wanna hit the arcade after this to make you feel better, BaAaBy?”, Lion said, treating Mickey like a cranky toddler. “Shut up, Lion. But fine.”, Mickey said, groaning. “Cool.”, Lion said, throwing his water bottle in the air, and then evaporating it. “Alright. We’re here.”, Mickey said, standing up straight. “Alright, let’s kick some cursed butt.”, Lion said, before walking in. “Yeah, what you said.”, Mickey said tiredly, before following behind. Lion takes care of a grade four curse, and Mickey turns it into a ball, and swallows it. “Blech. It’s so gross that it almost makes you laugh.”, Mickey said, rubbing his throat. “But it’s worth it, cause then you can-“, Lion said, before Lion and Mickey said, “Control the curse and make it fight.”, at the same time. “Yeah, I know, Lion. But they taste disgusting.”, Mickey said. “They taste like literal trash.”, Mickey added. “Well, they’re pure negativity, so maybe that’s the reason.”, Lion said jokingly. “Well, maybe we need to get rid of the source of the negativity.”, Mickey said. “…you know we can’t kill non-sorcerers, Mick. That’s wrong.”, Lion said, now serious. “You have to make two wrongs to make a right, Right?”, Mickey said, now facing Lion. “Sometimes two wrongs can make three wrongs, Mick.”, Lion said. “It would be the easiest way. They don’t have any curse energy, let alone a technique. So, why can’t we get rid of the people that make the curses? Why can’t we get rid of the source of the problem?”, Mickey said, now angry. “Cause it’s not right. If we kill all non-sorcerers, jujutsu wouldn’t exist, the world would end, and eventually, we would become the humans, and curses would still linger.”, Lion said. “It would still be better with no people. You could do it Lion.”, Mickey said. “You could get rid of all non-sorcerers. You could make the world a better place. You could help save the world from the evil that lives, breathes, eats, rids on the world. Non-sorcerers.”, Mickey explained. “Mickey, it just isn’t right.”, Lion said. “Are you strong because your Lion? Or are you Lion because you’re strong?”, Mickey asked. “What are you trying to say?”, Lion asked. “I’m asking if your strength defines who you are. Because it doesn’t. One day, Lion. I’ll make the world a better place, I just have to make it.”, Mickey explained. “I wanna help people. I wanna make a change. Like you. You’re a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help. I find that very, very confusing, Lion. So, please. Let me help. I’m strong, and you could do it with me.”, Mickey asked. “Help me eliminate all non-sorcerers.”, Mickey asked again. A moment of silence fell upon the two, before Lion replied, saying, “Killing innocent people, regardless of whether they’re sorcerers or not, doesn’t solve the root problem. It only perpetuates a cycle of hatred and fear. We have to be better. We have to find another way. I’m sorry, Mickey, I can’t. I just can’t. My hands are tied, and you don’t see your error.”, Lion said. “Fine then. If you don’t stand by me, you stand in front of me. You’re in my way.”, Mickey said, beginning to ready his Cursed Technique to fight. “Mickey, please. You’re my friend. I don’t wanna fight you.”, Lion said, preparing his cursed technique for defense, not wanting to hurt Mickey. “I wouldn’t wanna fight me either.”, Mickey said, before sending out a grade three curse at Lion. Lion dodged, and tried to reason with Mickey. “Mickey, come on! This isn’t you.”, Lion said, outrunning the curse chasing him. “You’re right, Lion. This isn’t me. This is the new me.”, Mickey said, and with a swift motion of his hand, the curse swept Lion into a wall. Lion used his cursed technique to reinforce his body in order to not take damage. “Mickey, listen to what you’re saying. You want to kill innocent people to make a better place.”, Lion said, dashing towards Mickey, preparing to disarm him. “You have to get rid of non-innocents to make innocents.”, Mickey said. Lion jumped up, and prepared to kick Mickey. But just about when he was gonna kick, he stopped. “Mickey, please. I’m your friend. Let me help.”, Lion said, holding onto Mickeys shoulder. “I don’t need any help.”, Mickey said, brushing off lions hand. “And I’m not your friend.”, Mickey said, before Mickey left, not just the building. But lions friendship. The jujutsu high school. We then cut back to present day. “It’s been five years ever since that day occurred.”, Lion said, tears running down his face. “Your room…it was Mickeys. It was ours.”, Lion said. “So, what happened to Mickey…?”, Mugman asked, feeling a lump grow in his throat. “I don’t know. I haven’t seen him since.”, Lion said. “I tell you this, Mugman, so that you learn that your strength does not define who you are, it does not define the world. Your choices define what you are. And what you do.”, Lion said, now crying. “I…I understand, sensei.”, Mugman said, now also tearing up. “During these three weeks…can you teach me all you know?”, Mugman asked. “I’d be happy to, Mugman.”, Lion said, putting down his pen. And so, Mugman trained relentlessly. And then his suspension was up. We cut to three weeks later, with Mugman, Bendy, and Cuphead heading to Kanto, to go and recruit another sorcerer from their sister school. “So, who are we picking up?”, Mugman asked, while playing Flappy Bird on his phone. “Alice.”, Cuphead said, looking out of the window. “Oh. Does she have a cursed technique?”, Mugman asked. “Yeah, obviously, Mugman.”, Cuphead replied. “What is it?”, Mugman asked. “It’d be too good to spoil you, Mugman. But just know this: When she gets worked up…her power is comparable to Jules.”, Bendy said. “Whaaaat? You’re lying.”, Mugman said, not believing Bendy. “Trust me, Mugman.”, Bendy said. Then, the train stops, and the location says that they’ve arrived in Kanto. “Alright, let’s go to our sister school.”, Cuphead said, leading the group. “How is it that you’re a grade two sorcerer leading the group, but I’m a grade THREE sorcerer being led by a lower class?”, Bendy said frustrated. “Dunno, don’t care.”, Cuphead said. Eventually, after about an hour of walking, they arrive at their sister school. Cuphead and his gang walk in, and check in with this schools principal/sensei. They then go to Alice’s room. Mugman knocks on the door. “Ugh, who is it?”, a voice said from inside the room. “Chicka-chicka boom boom.”, Bendy said out of nowhere. Suddenly, the room got quiet, and Alice opened the door. “Bendy?”, Alice asked. “Hey, you remembered the signal!”, Bendy said happily. “And uh…who are these losers?”, Alice asked, whispering to Bendy. “Oh, there with me. We need to recruit you for a mission.”, Bendy whispered back. “Oh.”, Alice said. Alice stepped back, and looked at Mugman and Cuphead. “And you guys are…?”, Alice asked. Mugman raised his hand, and introduced himself. “Hi! I’m Mugman, Grade Two sorcerer!”, Mugman said happily. “Nice to meet you.”, Mugman added, extending his hand. Alice then glared at Cuphead. “I’m Cuphead.”, Cuphead said, looking away. Alice stared at the two for a minute. “This…’Mugman’ guy looks weird. Definitely the kid that ate his own boogers. Does he even have a cursed technique? And Cuphead thinks that he’s the GOAT, by just telling me his name.”, Alice thought. “Why am I always stuck with the weird ones.”, Alice said, sighing. “We need you cause your ‘apparently’, pretty strong.”, Mugman said, with skepticism and sarcasm in his voice. Alice gritted her teeth at Mugman. “And what’s that supposed to mean, you little narc?”, Alice said, angry. “What I’m saying is that I don’t believe that you’re that tough that you could rival Jules in power. I mean…”, Mugman says, about to say something to set Alice off. “…you’re a girl!”, Mugman said. Alice’s top blew off. “Alright then, dippy. Let’s spar right here, right now. “Okay.”, Mugman said. Alice and Mugman then head out into the field. Mugman stands still,e doe ting Alice to be on the level of a grade one sorcerer. Alice ready her stance. “Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey.”, Alice states, before a pair of die appear before Alice. Alice then pulls out one of her weapons, and places it down. “Bet one of your items, or anything that you have.”, Alice said. Mugman, underestimating her, places down EWF. Suddenly, both of their items are sucked into the dice, and Alice pockets the dice. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off.”, Alice said, activating her domain expansion. Suddenly, a black dome surrounds the two, and the two are placed in a card game of War. “What the? Why are we playing War?”, Mugman thought. Mugman dashed to get up and attack Alice, but was quickly placed back down into the chair. “Ah, ah, ah.”, Alice said, waving her finger. “You already made a bet. Now you have to play the game.”, Alice said. Suddenly, Mugmans mind was filled with the rules of her technique. Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey When this Cursed Technique activates, it summons a pair of die. After the die are summoned, the two people fighting are forced to put one thing they have on a “bet”, that if either of them lose the “bet”, that object or anything that they had bet is destroyed beyond repair. When both players have placed their “bets”, the person with this cursed technique (gamblers monkey), activates their Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off, which puts the opponent and the other opponent either in a boxing arena, a game of cards (can be blackjack, poker or war), or puts them back at the betting stage to bet one more item. If either of them lose any of the challenges or refuses to put down something to bet, that person, along with their item(or items that they betted), are eradicated. If either of the players lose in one of the battles, they, and their betted item, are eradicated. The Domain Expansion for this cursed technique is automatic, and does not require cursed energy to activate or form. “Woah, this is how the game functions, huh?”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “Yup, glad that I gave you the rules, huh?”, Alice said with a smirk. “Sure.”, Mugman said, before he drew a card, and they both began to play the game. As they were playing the game, Mugman thought about how unique her technique was. It wasn’t one made for fighting, it was made for gambling, Which he thought was honestly pretty cool. It’s not everyday that you get to see cursed techniques like this, let alone, cursed techniques that aren’t inherited or copied. Mugman put down a card, and with that swift motion, Mugman won the game. The domain dissipates, and the pair of die fly out of Alice’s pocket. Suddenly, Mugmans EWF drops in front of him, while the dice holding Alice’s weapons shivers, and then cracks, and dies. Alice grits her teeth, while Mugman hold EWF in his hand, looking at its new design and material. “Woah, what happened to my weapon?”, Mugman said, asking Alice. Alice, still angry about her loss, answers Mugman, “When you win against my technique, it enhances the item or whatever you betted by tenfold.”, Alice said. “Cool!”, Mugman stated. “Alice…”, Mugman began to ask. “I want to gamble again.”, Mugman asked. Alice looked up. “Half of my lifespan, if I lose, goes away. If I win, my cursed energy is increased by tenfold, and remains that way from now on.”, Mugman said. “MUGMAN, ARE YOU CRAZY?! YOU DONT WANNA BET LIKE THAT, THATS TOO RISKY!”, Bendy yelled. Alice grinned. “THIS IS WHAT I LIKE TO SEE! I LIKE TO SEE HIGH STAKES!”, Alice yelled with a grin. “I accept your bet, Mugman. If I win, I get half of your remaining lifespan, but if I lose, the cursed energy that you receive that multiplies your cursed energy tenfold will be my own cursed energy!”, Alice yelled. Mugman also grinned. “Let’s do it!”, he yelled. Alice threw out the die once more, and the die absorbed Mugmans cursed energy, and half of his life. The other die absorbed Alice’s Cursed energy. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off!”, Alice yelled. A black dome surrounded the two, and the two were placed into a boxing ring. “This is it, Mugman. This is the coin toss that decides our fate. Let’s hope that we win.”, Alice said, grinning. “Good luck.”, Mugman said, getting into a boxing stance. “I don’t need luck. I’m full of it.”, Alice said, starting off the boxing match with a right hook, followed by a jab to the stomach. Mugman blocks the right hook, but is punched in his gut. Mugman retaliates with 3 right jabs, followed by a left hook, and three right jabs, all to the face. Alice blocked the last few, after being hit by the first few. Alice tried to juke Mugman by winding up a left hook, only to throw a right jab. Mugman didn’t fall for it though, dodging the right jab, before mollywhopping Alice in the face, sending her into the ropes of the ring. Alice relaxed for a minute, before pushing back on the ropes, sending herself flying into Mugman. Alice threw a flurry of punches at Mugman, with some landing, and some being blocked. Mugman threw a right hook at the same time Alice also threw a right hook, leaving them at a temporary standstill. “You’re good. You’ve been practicing?”, Alice asked sarcastically. “You know, I’m something of an athlete myself.”, Mugman answered, before following a jab that lasted for 0.01 seconds. Alice was sent back by the jab, both surprised and injured. Alice let herself fall down to avoid another jab by Mugman, before catching her self, and pushing herself back up to land a left hook on Mugman. Mugman was sent back, but caught himself on the rings ropes. Mugman dodged a punch to the face, and rapidly punched Alice in the stomach, before landing on uppercut. Alice fell down, but quickly got up to avoid losing. “I gotta dodge his punches for a while, until I can regain my stamina.”, Alice thought, dodging a jab from Mugman. Mugman slowed his jabs, trying to predict where she would dodge. But as Mugman tried to land another punch, he reimbursed the words of his sensei. “Don’t let your strength define you. Let your choices define who you are.”, Mugman thought, imaging his sensei fighting by his side. Mugman landed multiple punches and labs on Alice, and with landing the final blow, Alice was done. But, as Alice accepted her defeat, she felt something catch her by the collar. It was Mugman. “Stand still for ten seconds.”, Mugman instructed. Alice, in a daze, didn’t answer, but just stood there. Mugman walked over to one of the corners of the ring, and began to smash his head in. “He…he’s…he’s trying to initiate a tie…”, Alice thought, as she felt her legs become numb. And with the last blow to Mugmans head, both of the contestants fell to the floor, bruised and battered. The domain fell, and the two received their betted items back, not enhanced. Mugman used his Reversed Cursed Technique to heal his injuries, with Alice doing the same. “Why?”, Alice asked. “You had me on the final thread. Why give it up? Why give up ten times the energy you have now? Why give up the best statistics in jujutsu history?”, Alice asked, genuinely curious. “A wise person once told me that your strength doesn’t define who you are. It’s your choices. My strength is defined by my choices, and my choices defined me. I know what power can do to a person. It isn’t pretty. I didn’t want either of us to become absorbed by power, and do something risky that might chance the future maybe fifty, or a hundred years later. The future I want to make is the future that will become. A better world.”, Mugman said. Alice got up, dusting herself off. “Most sorcerers I know would’ve taken that chance and stomped my face in. But…you’re different. You’re the most respectable sorcerer I know now.”, Alice said, extending out her hand this time. “I’m Alice. Special Grade Sorcerer.”, Alice said with a smile on her face. Mugman shook her hand. “Mugman Grace, Second Grade Sorcerer.”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “So…uh…how did it go…?”, Bendy asked, looking at the two worried that one of them won. “It was a tie. And Alice is coming along with us.”, Mugman said. Alice confirmed, saying, “True dat.” “Alright, well, let’s head back to Tokyo. Our sensei is waiting to give us our next mission.”, Cuphead said, eating a chocolate stick. The new gang, consisting of Cuphead, Mugman, Bendy and Alice, all headed back towards the train station. We then cut to Tokyo, five hours later. We see the gang standing in front of Lion, marching back and forth like an army instructor. “Alright, guys. Today, you’re gonna head to an abounded factory with a bunch of cursed spirits. Two things: One, this might be a possible location of Jules finger. And two…”, Lion said, before continuing. “This might be a hideout of a sorcerer that went rogue 7 years ago. So, be on the lookout.”, Lion said. Most of the group just shrugged it off, but Mugman didn’t. Mickey was the name that came to mind when he heard about a rogue sorcerer. “We got it, sensei.”, they all said in unison. And with that, they set off. 4 hours later, they arrive. “Alright, here’s the plan. Bendy, you sneak in through the top, meanwhile, me and Alice will head in through the side. Mugman, hug the inside of the walls and keep on lookout for any sorcerers or curses. Got it, gang?”, Cuphead said. “Ahem. I believe that I’m the highest graded sorcerer, Cuphead.”, Alice said jokingly. “Shut up, Alice.”, Cuphead said. “Okay, Move out.”, Cuphead ordered, before everyone dashed so fast that they disappeared. Mugman cleared the outside, and reported, “no one outback. Red lobster, what do you see on the bottom floor with Wonder Woman?”, “Mugman, what are you talking about?”, Cuphead asked, genuinely confused. “Oh, I’m using code name! 8m Blue Jay, your Red Lobster, Alice is Wonder Woman, and Bendy is Lil’ Devil!”, Mugman said. “Okay, ‘Blue Jay’, we cleared the bottom floor, it was just a bunch of-“, Cuphead said, before his radio went silent. We see a sword go through Cupheads radio. “If I had practiced a little more, I would’ve pinned you to the wall.”, a mysterious figure said behind them. Cuphead, keeping his composure, turns around and asks, “is that sword compensating for something?” The mysterious figure smirks, and answers, “No, actually. It’s antique. old. And has a rope attached to it.”, as he pulls the sword back, cutting Cuphead on the nose. Alice then turns towards the figure. “Who even are you?”, Alice asks. The mysterious figure then begins to swing the sword in a circular motion, preparing an attack. “Why would I tell you that?”, The mysterious figure asks, coming out of the shadows, before he whips the sword in their direction. Cuphead and Alice ready their Cursed Techniques. “So that we can call you names while rubbing your face in the dirt.”, Alice says. The mysterious figure finally reveals himself to be Mickey. “Alright then. Let’s see if your sensei taught you well.”, Mickey says, before he swings his sword. Cuphead and Alice go on defense, staying back to back. Mickey then swings down from above, seemingly teleporting. “How come I can’t sense his cursed energy?”, Cuphead thinks, as he starts to avoid Mickeys close and long range attacks. Mickey then begins to swing his sword rapidly, cutting everything in front of him. “ALICE! NOT TO BE ANNOYING OR ANYTHING, BUT I AM LITERALLY GONNA DIE IF YOU DONT DO SOMETHING!”, Cuphead yelled, narrowing avoiding his head getting chopped off. Alice then summons a deck of cards, and throws them at Mickey. Mickey dashes again, this time in front of Alice. “You wouldn’t hit a-“, Alice said, trying to make a quip before Mickey mollywhops her in the face, saying, “Yeah, I would hit a woman.” Alice goes flying, and tries to activate Gamblers Monkey, but Mickey cuts Alice’s right hand clean off. Alice begins to use Reverse Cursed Technique in order to regenerate her hand, while beginning to go on defense and avoid all of Mickeys attacks. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Mugman crashes through the window. Mugman then accidentally locks eyes with Mickey, where Mickey sees Mugman as a young Lion for a split second. Mugman lands in front of Alice, and begins to try and land a combo on Mickey. Mickey quickly remembers this combo. “Oh, this is Lions. So, Lion taught these kids jujutsu, huh? Alright then. Lucky me, since he taught me these moves too. And how to counter them.”, Mickey thinks, as he blocks Mugmans combo. Mickey backs up, and sees Mugman, Cuphead and Alice in front of him. “So, if it isn’t Lions students. He’s been busy, huh? Training the next generation of sorcerers to fight his battles.”, Mickey says, engaging in banter with the trio. “Mickey, listen. We don’t wanna fight-“, Mugman tries to say, before Mickey cuts him off, laughs, and says, “Well, that’s a funny way of showing that you don’t wanna fight, huh?” Mugman frowns, and Cuphead steps up. “Whatever we do, we don’t wanna fight you. We just need some help.”, Cuphead says. “Help? Help you? Help the very institution I left? Help Lion? You all are as stubborn as he is. You kids don’t know how to make the best change in this world. Lion certainly didn’t.”, Mickey retorts, pointing out his sword. Mugman replied, “Mickey, please. Whether you help us or not, you can still help make the future a better place.” “You wanna know something very interesting? You sound JUST like him. You sound like Lion. Always thinking that there is another way. Without murder. Always talking about more options, and more chances. News Flash, Lion Jr., the world doesn’t work like that.”, Mickey said, tightening his grip on his sword. “Mickey, you once believed in changing the world, just like us. Maybe our way isn’t perfect, but it’s a start. Help us make it better.”, Mugman said. Mickey lowered his sword, and looked at Mugman. “I’m not promising anything, but I guess I’ll hear you guys out.”, Mickey said. Just then, Mickey coughed up some blood. Mickey then fell to one knee. “Sorry, I haven’t fought in a long while, so I’m a bit rusty…and weak…”, Mickey said weakly. “Oh, wait, here.”, Mugman said, finally letting his guard down and healing Mickey. Mickey is then healed back to full health and energy. “Thanks…”, Mickey said. “Hey…do you remember how I said I’d hear you out?”, Mickey asked with one eye open. Mugman looked at Mickey with a little confusion.","completion":"“Yeah, I remember,” Mugman responded cautiously, sensing something in Mickey's tone that he couldn’t quite place. “Well, forget it.” Mickey’s attitude suddenly shifted, his once weakened posture straightening as he wielded his sword with renewed vigor. “I was only buying time to recover. You kids are too naïve.” Cuphead, Alice, and Mugman stood in shock, their momentary relief vanishing as quickly as it had appeared. “Mickey, why?” Mugman’s voice was filled with disappointment, not solely because of the immediate betrayal, but because of the realization that some rifts were too wide to bridge, even with the best intentions. In that moment of disillusionment, however, something sparked within Mugman. A determination, a flame kindled not by the prospect of convincing Mickey, but fueled by the realization that their paths were irrevocably divergent. Mickey, no matter what remnants of his past self that might have existed, had chosen his path—one starkly opposed to what Mugman and his friends stood for. “Fine. If it's a fight you want, Mickey, it’s a fight you’ll get. But not because we can’t see another way, but because you’ve forced our hands,” Mugman declared, his voice steady, his resolve clear. This wasn’t just about Mickey anymore; it was about protecting what they were striving to build. Without another word, the trio engaged Mickey once again, their strategies adapting to the merciless reality that sometimes, confrontation is inevitable. Cuphead targeted Mickey with precision shots, Alice used what remained of her cursed energy to conjure deceptive illusions, and Mugman moved with a newfound agility, his attacks a blend of offense and defense, embodying both the ferocity and compassion that defined him. The battle raged, a testament to not just their physical abilities but the clashing ideologies that fueled them. With each blow exchanged, it became clearer that there was more at stake than just their immediate survival; they were fighting for the very essence of what it meant to be a jujutsu sorcerer. As the dust settled, Mickey, overwhelmed by the trio’s relentless determination and teamwork, found himself at a disadvantage. It was in this moment of vulnerability that Mugman approached him, not with the intention to deliver a final blow, but with an offer of mercy. “Mickey, this doesn’t have to be the end. You can still choose a different path, one that doesn’t lead to more suffering,” Mugman extended his hand, an offer of peace amidst the chaos. But before Mickey could respond, a sudden, intense wave of cursed energy washed over them. From the shadows emerged a figure, one that carried an aura of immense power. The newcomer’s presence alone was enough to pause the conflict, drawing the attention of friends and foes alike. “Enough,” the figure spoke, their voice commanding immediate attention. “The path forward requires unity, not division.” As Mugman looked up, the identity of the newcomer dawned on him—it was none other than Lion, his mentor. With his arrival, the air shifted, the unresolved tensions hanging heavily between them. What happened next would define not just their futures, but the future of their world. Mugman realized then that their journey was far from over. It was a journey not just of becoming stronger sorcerers, but of understanding the true nature of strength and the responsibility that came with it. And as he stood there, amidst friends and former allies, he knew that whatever challenges lay ahead, they would face them together, as a united front."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Phew!

Given the information: - \\"RR\\" could represent the genotype for red flowers. - \\"WW\\" could represent the hypothetical genotype for white flowers (even though \\"W\\" is used, we'll treat it as the notation for this scenario). For incomplete dominance, crossing (RR) (red) with (WW) (white) would not produce either red or white flowers. Instead, the offspring would exhibit a phenotype that is a blend of the two — in this case, pink. This means that the genotypes of the offspring would be something like (RW), where the phenotype is not purely one parent's trait or the other's, but rather a mix or blend of both.

In co-dominance, the offspring from the cross (RR times WW) would not blend the two colors into pink (as in incomplete dominance) but would instead express both colors simultaneously.

Like, Pepsi was from somewhere like France or the Netherlands while Coke was from somewhere like... I dunno Austria, Latvia, Poland or Indonesia lol","completion":"This alternate history scenario presents an interesting thought experiment about global branding, cultural exchange, and economic impacts. Let's explore potential outcomes and developments from your scenario. **Pepsi from France or the Netherlands:** 1. **Cultural Impact**: Both these nations have rich histories in culinary arts and beverages. Pepsi's identity might have been deeply influenced by European tastes and sensibilities. It could have started as a more artisanal or craft-style beverage, perhaps incorporating unique local ingredients. Imagine a Pepsi with slight lavender notes from the Provence region in France or a hint of tulip or an innovative take using licorice flavors reflecting Dutch traditions. 2. **Branding and Expansion**: Starting in Europe, Pepsi's global expansion strategy might have differed. It could have used Europe's colonial connections differently, perhaps first spreading to Africa, Asia, and the Americas through different trade routes and colonial ties, especially if it began in the era of the Dutch or French colonial empires. 3. **Economic Impact**: The European origin might have shifted the global soft drink market's dynamics, with Europe being the epicenter of soft drink innovation and production, possibly making it a significant export product earlier on. Further, this could have had implications for sugar trade routes, agricultural focuses (e.g., beet sugar versus cane), and related industries. **Coca-Cola from Austria, Latvia, Poland, or Indonesia:** 1. **Cultural Influence**: The origin country could deeply influence Coca-Cola's initial flavor profile and branding. For example, if it were from Austria, it might have initially been marketed as a kind of herbal tonic, fitting in with the country's history of herbal medicines. From Latvia or Poland, there might have been an initial emphasis on local ingredients like berries or herbs, reflecting those countries' culinary traditions. If originating from Indonesia, Coca-Cola could have featured tropical fruit flavors or spices, aligning with the region's rich biodiversity. 2. **Market Dynamics**: Originating in any of these countries would drastically alter Coca-Cola's market dynamics and historical growth. The company might have faced different challenges and opportunities based on the local economic conditions, political landscape, and access to international markets. For instance, starting in Indonesia might have facilitated early expansion into other Asian markets but presented unique challenges in reaching Western consumers. 3. **Global Reception and Expansion**: The path to becoming a global brand would be significantly different. The soft drink might have encountered resistance in entering the U.S. and other markets, or conversely, it might have been embraced as an exotic novelty. Marketing strategies would need to be localized and adapted more extensively to cater to diverse global tastes. **Overall Industry Impact:** - **Innovation and Competition**: The beverage industry might have been more fragmented initially, with regional powerhouses competing on a more even playing field. This could lead to greater innovation and diversification of products. - **Cultural Exchange**: The global spread of these beverages from different origins would contribute to cross-cultural exchanges, introducing consumers worldwide to tastes and ingredients native to the beverage's country of origin. - **Economic Influence**: These companies' growth could significantly impact their home countries' economies, influencing agricultural practices, manufacturing, and international trade relationships. This alternate history posits a world where the cultural and economic influence of now-American soft drink giants stems from entirely different roots, offering a fascinating lens through which to view the interconnectedness of global commerce, culture, and consumption."},{"prompt":"Or what if something European like Fanta or Heineken came from the US?","completion":"Reimagining the origins of European brands like Fanta or Heineken as being from the United States offers an intriguing twist on the global cultural and economic landscape. Let's delve into how such a shift might have influenced their development, market dynamics, and cultural impact. **Fanta Originating from the United States:** Fanta was originally developed in Germany during World War II due to a trade embargo that made it impossible to import Coca-Cola syrup. However, if Fanta had originated in the U.S., its history and product evolution could have been markedly different. 1. **Product Development and Flavor**: Without the wartime constraints and necessity that led to Fanta's creation, its American version might have begun as a bold innovation in the soft drink market, potentially focusing on unique American flavors. Imagine regional variations like a maple-flavored Fanta from the Northeast or a citrus twist from Florida. The brand could have capitalized on America's diverse agricultural products to create a wide variety of flavors early on. 2. **Marketing and Cultural Integration**: Fanta's marketing campaigns have often focused on fun, youth, and vibrancy. As an American brand, these themes could have been amplified through tie-ins with American pop culture phenomena, from rock 'n' roll to Hollywood movies, making Fanta emblematic of American lifestyle and leisure culture. 3. **Global Expansion**: Fanta's entry into international markets from an American base might have followed similar pathways to other U.S.-based soft drinks, leveraging America's post-WWII economic and cultural influence to gain footholds around the world. However, as a latecomer, Fanta would need to carve out a unique niche, possibly by emphasizing its variety and innovation in flavors. **Heineken Originating from the United States:** Heineken, founded in Amsterdam in 1864, is known worldwide for its distinct flavor and brand. Had it originated in the U.S., several aspects of its development and global presence might differ. 1. **Brewing Tradition and Taste**: American Heineken would be shaped by the United States' brewing traditions, which historically have been diverse, incorporating influences from German, Irish, and other immigrants. This could result in a Heineken that either adopts a flavor profile appealing to the broad American palate or experiments with a wider range of beer types early on. 2. **Expansion and Market Strategy**: Heineken's foray into the global market might leverage American economic power and cultural reach differently. It could position itself as a premium American lager abroad, utilizing American themes and cultural icons in its advertising. Within the U.S., it might face competition from both domestic crafts and imports, shaping its marketing strategies around authenticity and quality. 3. **Cultural Impact**: As an American brand, Heineken might sponsor major U.S. sports events, music festivals, and other cultural landmarks, embedding itself in the American socio-cultural fabric. Globally, it might become synonymous with a certain image of American lifestyle, much as Coca-Cola and McDonald's have. **Overall Industry Implications:** - **Innovation and Diversification**: These brands could have played pivotal roles in driving innovation within their categories, reflecting American entrepreneurial spirit and technological advancement. - **Economic and Cultural Exchange**: Facilitating a different flow of cultural exchange, these brands might introduce aspects of American culture to the world and vice versa, influencing tastes, preferences, and consumer behaviors globally. - **Global Brand Dynamics**: The global beverage and brewing industries' competitive dynamics would shift, with other brands responding to Fanta's and Heineken's market strategies, leading to a diverse and possibly more fragmented global market. Reimagining these iconic brands as American fundamentally alters the tapestry of global consumer culture, highlighting the intricate ways in which products, brands, and consumption practices are interwoven with national identities, economic forces, and cultural exchanges."},{"prompt":"This plant has pink flowers P generation was one red flowering plant and one white flowering plant image.png What kind of inheritance is this?

This is a case of incomplete dominance. The resulting cross (RR x WW) will produce a ________________ phenotype. Group of answer choices red white red and white pink","completion":"In a case of incomplete dominance, when a flower with a homozygous dominant trait (e.g., red, RR if we denote red as R) is crossed with a flower with a homozygous recessive trait (white, WW if we denote white as W), the resulting offspring express a blend of the parental traits. However, the notation provided (RR x WW) is not typical for incomplete dominance, as it suggests simple or complete dominance. Incomplete dominance usually involves alleles being represented as the same letter with different superscripts or simply as capital and lowercase of the same letter if simplifying. Assuming we adapt this to a more conventional notation or concept understanding for incomplete dominance (like Rr, where 'R' represents red and 'r' represents white), and considering the essence of your question: The resulting cross would produce offspring with a phenotype that is a blend of both parents. If the traits were indeed following incomplete dominance in the spirit of your question, and 'R' is for red and 'W' is for white, but adjusting to traditional notation (e.g., CR for red and CW for white, or just R for red and r for white in a simplified version): A correct crossing showing incomplete dominance could be represented as CR CR (for red) x CW CW (for white), leading to offspring that are CR CW, which would display the mixed phenotype (pink in the case of flower color).

Your friends • Do you prefer to have one particular friend or a group of friends? [Why?] Personally, I value having a bunch of friends rather than just one best friend. This is because a group provides a diverse range of perspectives and personalities that can enrich interactions and experiences. Each friend brings their own unique insights, humor, and support to the table, which means that I can enjoy a variety of activities and conversations. With a group, there’s also a higher chance that someone is available when I need company or assistance. Moreover, social dynamics in a group can be more dynamic and engaging. It’s the difference in character and backgrounds that makes spending time with a group of friends so rewarding for me. • What do you like doing most with your friends? My friends and I have a wide array of interests. For instance, We’re all movie enthusiasts, so hitting the cinema for the latest release is a frequent joy. When we crave activity, we’ll play sports like soccer or basketball, or when we seek adventure, we head out for outdoor excursions like hiking or camping. If we’re indoors, competitive spirits emerge during board game nights or video game marathons. For a change of pace, we sometimes plan trips together, embarking on road trips or traveling to new destinations, which is a thrilling way to create shared experiences. Lastly, we enjoy cultural outings such as visiting museums and historical landmarks to immerse our minds in culture, history or art. These activities foster our camaraderie and provide a great balance between excitement and learning. • Do you think it's important to keep in contact with friends you knew as a child? [Why?/Why not?] childhood friendships are built on a foundation of deep trust, because we’ve known these individuals from an early age. We’ve grown up together, and that shared history means we have a profound understanding of each other’s personalities, quirks, and character. This understanding often results in a unique level of trust that can be hard to find in friendships formed later in life. Moreover, the longer the friendship lasts, the more this common understanding and mutual trust deepen, allowing for a very special bond to develop. This bond can often lead to a sense of security and acceptance which is truly invaluable. There’s a comfort in knowing you have people in your life who’ve seen all sides of you and who remain committed friends. • What makes a friend into a good friend? A good friend, I believe, is someone who is reliable, trustworthy, and compassionate. Reliability is crucial because you need to know that your friend will be there for you through your highs and lows. Trustworthiness is another essential trait because a good friend keeps your confidences and acts with your best interests at heart. Compassion is also important, as a good friend empathizes with your struggles and offers support without judgment. Additionally, good friends communicate openly and can enjoy each other’s company while also respecting each other’s need for space when necessary. This blend of reliability, trust, compassion, and communication is what truly makes a friend a good friend. PART 2: Describe an important choice you had to make in your life. You should say: • When you had to make this choice? • what you had to choose between? • whether you made a good choice? • And explain how you felt when you were making this choice. One of the most critical choices I had to make in my life came after high school when I was presented with an opportunity to study abroad. It happened several years ago, and it presented quite a dilemma, as on one hand, there was the chance to study in a reputed foreign institution, and on the other, I had the option to enroll in a respected university within my own country, Iran. The choice was really between embracing an entirely new culture and educational system, or staying within the comfort of my homeland, surrounded by family and friends. After much contemplation, I decided to stay in Iran. Looking back, I believe I made the right decision. Although the prospect of studying abroad was exciting, the value of staying close to my support network and the quality education I could receive at home weighed heavier. During the decision-making process, I was quite anxious. It felt like standing at a crossroads, with each path leading to vastly different futures. There was a fear of missing out on the international experience, but also a strong pull towards what was familiar. Ultimately, the choice came down to where I saw myself in the long term, and that vision was clearer in my home country. PART 3 Discussion topics: Important choices • What are the typical choices people make at different stages of their lives? At different stages of life, individuals are faced with a variety of important choices. In adolescence, one might decide on a field of study or whether to pursue higher education. As young adults, the choices often revolve around career paths and personal relationships, such as committing to a long-term partnership or deciding where to live. Mid-life might bring decisions about family life, such as determining the right time to have children and figuring out how to maintain a work-life balance. Moving into the senior phase of life, choices often concern retirement planning and lifestyle adjustments. Each decision can significantly alter the course of one’s life journey, shaping future opportunities and personal fulfillment. • Should important choices be made by parents rather than by young adults? I believe that while parents should provide guidance and support, important choices should ultimately be made by young adults. This is crucial for their personal development and independence. The concept of ‘helicopter parenting,’ where parents hover over their children and make decisions for them, can actually be detrimental. It can prevent young adults from learning essential life skills and from taking responsibility for their actions. By making their own choices, they learn from both their successes and their mistakes, thereby becoming more resilient and self-reliant individuals. So, while parental advice is valuable, the act of decision-making should rest with the young adults themselves. • Why do some people like to discuss choices with other people? Some people prefer to discuss choices with others because it provides them with different perspectives and insights that they might not have considered themselves. Discussing options with friends, family, or colleagues can reveal new information, offer emotional support, and help clarify thoughts. It’s a bit like sounding boards - by vocalizing their thoughts and hearing feedback, individuals can better understand their own preferences and the potential consequences of their decisions. Moreover, involving others can be reassuring, especially when faced with significant life choices, as it helps to validate a person’s thought process and sometimes leads to more confident decision-making. Discussion topics: Choices in everyday life • What kind of choices do people have to make in their everyday life? In everyday life, people face a myriad of choices, ranging from the mundane to the profound. Upon waking, we decide what to wear based on the weather, our activities, or personal style. We choose what to eat, balancing taste preferences with health considerations. Commuting options like driving, public transport, or cycling depend on distance, cost, and convenience. Work or school present choices about task prioritization or study focus. Social interactions demand decisions about how to spend time or respond to others. Even leisure activities involve selection, such as which book to read or TV show to watch. These choices, small and large, collectively shape our daily experiences and ultimately, our lives. • Why do some people choose to do the same things every day? are there any disadvantages in this? Some people opt for routine because it provides a sense of stability and predictability, reducing the stress of constant decision-making. Routine can increase efficiency, as repeating tasks often leads to quicker and more proficient execution. Additionally, habits can be comforting and give a feeling of control over one’s environment. However, the downside of this consistency is that it can lead to a lack of spontaneity and possibly a resistance to change. It may also prevent people from trying new experiences that could lead to personal growth or unexpected enjoyment. Ultimately, the sameness can become monotonous, potentially making life feel less vibrant. • Do you think that people today have more choices to make today than in the past? Certainly, in today’s world, people tend to encounter more choices than in the past due to technological advances and interconnected nature the world. The internet provides access to a vast array of information and options in almost every aspect of life, from education to employment, shopping to entertainment. Globalization has brought diverse cultural influences and lifestyles to our doorsteps, enriching our possibilities. However, with this increase in choices comes the potential for decision fatigue, where the sheer volume of options can be overwhelming. While the abundance of choice generally allows for greater personal freedom and tailor-made experiences, it does demand more time and energy to navigate effectively. read the ielts exam i want you to ask you follow up questions about it.","completion":"Based on your responses and insights from the IELTS speaking exam topics, here are some follow-up questions: Regarding Your Friends: 1. **Diverse Friend Groups**: You mentioned appreciating the variety of perspectives and personalities in a group of friends.

This blend of reliability, trust, compassion, and communication is what truly makes a friend a good friend. PART 2: Describe an important choice you had to make in your life. You should say: • When you had to make this choice? • what you had to choose between? • whether you made a good choice? • And explain how you felt when you were making this choice. One of the most critical choices I had to make in my life came after high school when I was presented with an opportunity to study abroad. It happened several years ago, and it presented quite a dilemma, as on one hand, there was the chance to study in a reputed foreign institution, and on the other, I had the option to enroll in a respected university within my own country, Iran. The choice was really between embracing an entirely new culture and educational system, or staying within the comfort of my homeland, surrounded by family and friends. After much contemplation, I decided to stay in Iran. Looking back, I believe I made the right decision. Although the prospect of studying abroad was exciting, the value of staying close to my support network and the quality education I could receive at home weighed heavier. During the decision-making process, I was quite anxious. It felt like standing at a crossroads, with each path leading to vastly different futures. There was a fear of missing out on the international experience, but also a strong pull towards what was familiar. Ultimately, the choice came down to where I saw myself in the long term, and that vision was clearer in my home country. PART 3 Discussion topics: Important choices • What are the typical choices people make at different stages of their lives? At different stages of life, individuals are faced with a variety of important choices. In adolescence, one might decide on a field of study or whether to pursue higher education. As young adults, the choices often revolve around career paths and personal relationships, such as committing to a long-term partnership or deciding where to live. Mid-life might bring decisions about family life, such as determining the right time to have children and figuring out how to maintain a work-life balance. Moving into the senior phase of life, choices often concern retirement planning and lifestyle adjustments. Each decision can significantly alter the course of one’s life journey, shaping future opportunities and personal fulfillment. • Should important choices be made by parents rather than by young adults? I believe that while parents should provide guidance and support, important choices should ultimately be made by young adults. This is crucial for their personal development and independence. The concept of ‘helicopter parenting,’ where parents hover over their children and make decisions for them, can actually be detrimental. It can prevent young adults from learning essential life skills and from taking responsibility for their actions. By making their own choices, they learn from both their successes and their mistakes, thereby becoming more resilient and self-reliant individuals. So, while parental advice is valuable, the act of decision-making should rest with the young adults themselves. • Why do some people like to discuss choices with other people? Some people prefer to discuss choices with others because it provides them with different perspectives and insights that they might not have considered themselves. Discussing options with friends, family, or colleagues can reveal new information, offer emotional support, and help clarify thoughts. It’s a bit like sounding boards - by vocalizing their thoughts and hearing feedback, individuals can better understand their own preferences and the potential consequences of their decisions. Moreover, involving others can be reassuring, especially when faced with significant life choices, as it helps to validate a person’s thought process and sometimes leads to more confident decision-making. Discussion topics: Choices in everyday life • What kind of choices do people have to make in their everyday life? In everyday life, people face a myriad of choices, ranging from the mundane to the profound. Upon waking, we decide what to wear based on the weather, our activities, or personal style. We choose what to eat, balancing taste preferences with health considerations. Commuting options like driving, public transport, or cycling depend on distance, cost, and convenience. Work or school present choices about task prioritization or study focus. Social interactions demand decisions about how to spend time or respond to others. Even leisure activities involve selection, such as which book to read or TV show to watch. These choices, small and large, collectively shape our daily experiences and ultimately, our lives. • Why do some people choose to do the same things every day? are there any disadvantages in this? Some people opt for routine because it provides a sense of stability and predictability, reducing the stress of constant decision-making. Routine can increase efficiency, as repeating tasks often leads to quicker and more proficient execution. Additionally, habits can be comforting and give a feeling of control over one’s environment. However, the downside of this consistency is that it can lead to a lack of spontaneity and possibly a resistance to change. It may also prevent people from trying new experiences that could lead to personal growth or unexpected enjoyment. Ultimately, the sameness can become monotonous, potentially making life feel less vibrant. • Do you think that people today have more choices to make today than in the past? Certainly, in today’s world, people tend to encounter more choices than in the past due to technological advances and interconnected nature the world. The internet provides access to a vast array of information and options in almost every aspect of life, from education to employment, shopping to entertainment. Globalization has brought diverse cultural influences and lifestyles to our doorsteps, enriching our possibilities. However, with this increase in choices comes the potential for decision fatigue, where the sheer volume of options can be overwhelming. While the abundance of choice generally allows for greater personal freedom and tailor-made experiences, it does demand more time and energy to navigate effectively.","completion":"**PART 1: Improvements** 1. **Preference for Group of Friends** I decidedly lean towards cultivating friendships with a group, for it ushers in a tapestry of viewpoints and characteristics, thereby enriching every interaction. Each friend contributes distinct insights, wit, and support, enabling me to savor a spectrum of experiences. A group's dynamic nature fosters more engaging social interactions, making every moment spent together immensely rewarding due to the diverse characters and backgrounds. 2. **Favorite Activities with Friends** With my friends, I engage in a plethora of activities, our shared passion for cinema often leading us to the latest screenings. Our zest for life sees us participating in sports or embarking on outdoor adventures like hiking. Indoor times are filled with competitive board games or video game sessions. Occasionally, we plan excursions, exploring new horizons together, or indulge in cultural pursuits at museums, striking a seamless balance between exhilaration and intellectual enrichment. 3. **Maintaining Childhood Friendships** The bedrock of childhood friendships is the trust forged over years of growing up together, offering a unique understanding of each other's essence. This deep-seated bond, nurtured over time, provides unparalleled security and belongingness, evidencing the irreplaceable value of sustaining these connections. 4. **Qualities of a Good Friend** A quintessential friend is marked by unwavering reliability, trustworthiness, and compassion. Such a friend stands by you steadfastly, guarding your confidences while fostering an environment of empathy and open communication. This fusion of traits embodies the essence of true friendship. **PART 2: Important Choice Enhancement** Faced with a pivotal decision post-high school, the choice between embracing an unfamiliar academic adventure abroad and staying within the comforting embrace of my homeland loomed large. Opting to remain in Iran, I now reflect on the decision as being exceptionally judicious, given the invaluable support network and quality education here at home, which have significantly sculpted my present and future. **PART 3: Discussion Topics Enhancement** 1. **Typical Choices at Life Stages** Throughout life's journey, individuals confront pivotal decisions. Adolescence involves choosing educational paths; young adulthood is marked by career and relational decisions; mid-life prompts reflections on family and work-life balance, while later years focus on retirement and lifestyle choices. Each decision molds the trajectory of one's life, impacting future fulfillment and opportunities. 2. **Decision-making: Parents vs. Young Adults** While parental guidance is invaluable, empowering young adults to make their own choices is crucial for cultivating autonomy and resilience. Helicopter parenting, although well-intentioned, can hinder the development of essential life skills and self-reliance. The journey of making and learning from choices is foundational to personal growth. 3. **Discussing Choices with Others** Engaging in dialogues about decisions serves as a means to broaden perspectives, uncovering insights and support unattainable in solitude. This collaborative reflection process not only validates one's thought process but also fortifies confidence in the decisions made. 4. **Everyday Choices** Every day, individuals navigate a labyrinth of choices, from mundane selections like attire and meal options to critical decisions regarding work and social engagements. The culmination of these daily choices shapes our overall life experience. 5. **Routine vs. Spontaneity** Embracing routine offers a semblance of stability and predictability, streamlining decision-making and enhancing efficiency. However, excessive adherence to routine may stifle spontaneity and personal growth, underscoring the need for balance. 6. **Choices Increase Over Time** The modern era, characterized by technological and global advancements, has undoubtedly expanded the realm of choices available, from education and employment to lifestyle and entertainment. Despite providing greater freedom, this abundance can lead to decision fatigue, demanding more discernment in navigating the multitude of options."},{"prompt":"اريد 200 معلومة عن مخلوقات المحيطات","completion":"من الصعب تقديم 200 معلومة دقيقة ومفصلة في رسالة واحدة، ولكن إليك مجموعة مثيرة للاهتمام تتضمن معلومات عن مخلوقات المحيطات، وهي تغطي جوانب مختلفة بما في ذلك الحيوانات، الظواهر، والأنظمة البيئية البحرية: 1. الحوت الأزرق هو أكبر حيوان على وجه الأرض، يمكن أن يصل طوله إلى 100 قدم ويزن حتى 200 طن. 2. قلب الحوت الأزرق كبير جدًا لدرجة أن إنسانًا بالغًا يمكنه أن يسبح في شرايينه. 3. سمكة البراكيودونتس المكتشفة في العصر الديفوني منذ حوالي 400 مليون سنة، تُعتبر من أقدم الأسماك المعروفة. 4. كائنات المحيطات تُشكل حوالي 50% - 80% من كل الحياة على الأرض، معظمها لم يُكتشف بعد. 5. الديناصورات كانت تعيش على اليابسة، لكن الحيوانات البحرية العملاقة مثل البليوزور والموسازور كانت تعيش في المحيطات. 6. قناديل البحر موجودة منذ حوالي 650 مليون سنة، مما يجعلها من الكائنات الأطول بقاءً على الأرض. 7. الشعب المرجانية هي كائنات حية وليست صخورًا كما يظن البعض. 8. الأخطبوط لديه ثلاث قلوب، واحد ليضخ الدم حول جسمه واثنان لضخه عبر الخياشيم. 9. الأسماك المضيئة تستخدم الضوء للتمويه، والصيد، والتواصل مع بعضها البعض في أعماق المحيطات. 10. القرش الحوت يمكن أن يصل طوله إلى أكثر من 40 قدمًا، لكنه يتغذى في الغالب على البلانكتون. 11. سمك المندرين يُعد واحدًا من أجمل الأسماك في العالم بفضل ألوانه الزاهية. 12. الرخويات مثل الحبار والأخطبوط لديها دماغ معقد وتظهر علامات الذكاء والمكر. 13. البحار المتجمدة تشهد ظاهرة الكائنات الحية ذاتية الضوء كالقشريات وبعض الأسماك. 14. الأسماك الطائرة يمكنها القفز خارج الماء و\\"الطيران\\" لمسافات قصيرة. 15. الأنجلفيش العميق هو نوع من الأسماك يعيش في الأعماق المظلمة للمحيطات ويستخدم إشارة ضوئية لجذب فرائسه. 16. القرش الأبيض العظيم قد يكون مخيفًا، لكنه لا يعتبر الإنسان ضمن مصادر غذائه الأساسية. 17. القشريات مثل السرطان وجراد البحر تنمو عن طريق التخلص من قوقعتها في عملية تُسمى \\"القلش\\". 18. سمكة الغلوفيش (GloFish) هي أول حيوان معدّل وراثيًا تم إطلاقه للتجارة كحيوان أليف. 19. المحيطات تستوعب حوالي 50 ضعف المزيد من ثاني أكسيد الكربون مقارنة بالغلاف الجوي. 20. أنظمة المحيطات تشكل الجزء الأكبر من الموائل الطبيعية على الأرض وتساهم في التنوع البيولوجي. هذه فقط مجرد أمثلة قليلة عن العجائب المذهلة لكائنات المحيطات، وهناك الكثير لاكتشافه في عالمنا البحري المثير."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Phew!

Поляков, – Кому на Руси жить хорошо? Что такое «друзья народа», и как они воюют против социал-демократов? Как нам реорганизовать Рабкрин?» – Никогда не отвечаю на подобные вопросы, поскольку не верю, что кто-то не понимает роли социальных сетей в сегодняшней жизни. Впрочем, могу допустить, что многие как раз догадываются, но элементарно не умеют пользоваться этим мощным инструментом. Во-первых, информация. Ни один информационный сайт с кодлой тупых редакторов, не сравнится в оперативности с сетевым твитом. Да, здесь никто ничего не проверяет на подлинность, но возьмите, к примеру, какое-нибудь крупное информационное агентство, – чьи хозяева содержат свой весьма дорогостоящий ресурс исключительно в целях пропаганды, – какие он ещё рашает задачи, кроме тех, ради чего содержится? Комменты здесь Не думаю, что у них в приоритете достоверность информации, – смысл? Да и потом мы живём во времена, когда подлинно то, что релевантно. Именно в силу того, что среднестатистическая черепушка с большим трудом переваривает навалившийся на него огромный объём информации: что хочется – то и реально. И вы только прикиньте разницу в качестве ответа на тот или иной запрос между неповоротливой подцензурной спамерской машиной и тем же личным блогом. Да, у частника, как правило, нет инсайдеров во власти, но так ли уж многим действительно интересно, что там у них творится «за зубцами»? В конце концов, какую власть люди ожидают – такую им и выдадут в качестве образа. И если вы хотите только просматривать эти «весёлые картинки», как грицца, берегите ящик и не перепутайте каналы. А если перепутать? Действительно, что изменится, если мы вдруг запутаемся в телевизионных каналах? – Ровным счётом ничего. А вот на базе социальных сетей или персонального блога можно построить личный интерфейс к окружающему нас информационному пространству именно в силу интерактивности сетевых коммуникаций, чего полностью лишено радио и телевидение. И если телевизор, в основном, производит однозначно оценочную продукцию, – формируя положительное либо отрицательное отношение к предмету и, по сути, навязывает заданную и весьма конкретную повестку дня, – то в сети рулит так называемый «трафик», и здесь все предметы делятся на существующие и не существующие. Понимаете, да? То есть, сеть априори подразумевает активное отношение к информации вплоть до возможности самостоятельного производства событий или персональной модерации информационных потоков и коннотирования той или иной ситуации. То есть сеть позволяет, как минимум, построить своё персональное зеркало при условии, разумеется, достаточной «накаченности» вашего узла. Неужели этого мало? В любом случае, это ничто, если не игра, и всё зависит оттого, насколько успешно вы втяните публику в эту игру, например, на предмет перезагрузки действующей эрефийской системы. В тот момент, как я набираю эти буквы, боярская давла вошла в полосу глубокого пурпура и начала святиться инфернальным ультрафиолетом, так что момент выбран удачно. Тем не менее, надо хорошо себе представлять, что простая смена властного семейного пула отнюдь не приведёт страну к стато, и вся эта perezagruzka хотя и породит поначалу какие-то мелкие ништяки, но лет эдак через 25-30 всё начнётся заново и пойдёт по новому кругу. Ведь переход государственного режима от давлы к стато возможен лишь через фашизм – он же принудительный механизм конституирования гражданства и институтов власти, а вот в это-то как раз не очень верится, особенно сегодня, когда мир позиционирует себя как глобальная сеть. Или эти «национальные государства» – увы, они уходят в прошлое. И мы всё чаще видим, как религиозные или этнические общины играют роль спойлера для продвижения «чистой функции» без тех или иных протезов и индульгенций модерна. С этого и следует начинать игру, если действительно есть желание добиться цели. Но целью игры всегда является сама игра, – верно? И вопрос следующий: с кем играть? Ведь давла – это такая машина, где только две педали – тормоз и газ, педаль сцепления отсутствует. Собссна, причина, по которой цивилизация решила строить институты и жить по протоколу Закона, а не зависеть от частной воли «ручного управления». «У вас тут интересы, а мы здесь выживаем», – вот основная проблема боярской давлы, отрезающая все пути к интенсификации собственного узла и гарантирующая ей заведомо подчинённое положение в глобальном конкурентном диспозитиве. Позиция, сводимая ко всё той же роли спойлера – она же хрюшка, откармливаемая хозяином в качестве закуски на условное «рождество». И на любые запросы не из властного пула она не способна ответить ничем, кроме запретов и насилия. Причём, насилия «на всякий случай» в силу трогательной неспособности определить и понять смысл запроса. И тут необходимо добавить следующее. В отличие от арабской давлы, стремящейся к халифату, Эрефия, похоже, и была создана, чтобы продемонстрировать миру пример «отмирающего государства». То есть государства вообще. Аванпост Глобальной Левой, – витрина Коминтерна, оформленная в «евразийской» стилистике, – Россия так и не обрела подлинного суверенитета. Впрочем, не факт, что власть имущие к этому вообще когда-либо стремились. Именно отсюда идут все эти конспирологические теории про «всесильную» роль т.н. транснациональных корпораций (THK), живущих, де, вне интересов суверенов, хотя в реале дело обстоит ровным счётом наоборот: при смене оптики практически за любой ТНК весьма отчётливо виден ресурс, имплицитно накачивающий тот или иной суверенный узел, или, как сейчас принято выражаться – «крышу». Старо, как мир: «Если наш соломенный самолёт не взлетает, то где доказательства того, что у них самолёты тоже настоящие?»– Эффект обратного карго-культа, я его так называю: «Если Америка поднялась с того, что линчевала негров, почему бы нам не начать линчевать собственное население, – глядишь, и тоже поднимемся! И если транснациональные корпорации постоянно срут на интересы трудящих и не считаются ни с какими государственными суверенитетами, зачем рашке суверенитет – это, во-первых, а во-вторых, – не начать ли нам срать на самих себя и получить гарантии международной уважухи?»Это, как вы уже догадались, современные оналитеги-мудрецы, академики-панарины из орловских кагебешных ПТУ. Что на это ответить? Постинформационная, «сетевая» эпоха не просто «размыла» Левую Парадигму с её ставкой на унификацию и неразличимость. Она поставила на сегрегацию, поскольку открыла важнейший интенсификационный ресурс именно в плюральности и многообразии, конвертировав в глобальный сетевой диспозитив саму различимость, где значимость роли суверена увеличилась во много раз. Парадокс, но цена на Уникальное подскочила именно в тот момент, когда, казалось бы, похоронили Автора навсегда. Разумеется, ещё были те, кто надеялся на Маркса и его не менее бородатого любовника, но тут вдруг поняли, что этот маккиавелиевский этатизм, над которым смеялись эпигоны БородатыхЪ™, стал не только мощнейшим цивилизационным мотором, но и маркером самого западного превосходства. Ведь это лев может себе позволить сказать, что врагов у него нет, – а вы думали, «права человека» и прочее облизывание «меньшинств» происходят от романтической любви к ним? Скорее, наоборот, – от «аппетита». И в этом сетевом диспозитиве Эрефия сама зачем-то выставляет себя в качестве цели для ракет «здоровых сил мира» – а как ещё заставить обратить на себя внимание, с другой-то стороны? Однако тяга к «суккубу» Белого Человека всегда приводит к Холокосту™, и заинтересованные не дадут соврать: видите себя несчастными и гонимыми? Нет проблем, будете ими постоянно. Вам мешают агенты-цереу, окружили тройным-кольцом-врагов и воруют детей из детдомов, что вы держите в качестве сексуального материала для ваших же верхних? Нет проблем, расхуячим вашу «родину» ракетами без зазрения совести – превратим в реальность вашу сокровенную мечту. И всё снова, и как всегда: мечтают они, а жертва – всё равно ты. Вот здесь-то мы и обнаружили корень того феномена, что получил название «российский протест». Сильный, мощный корень вцепился в землю как хрен, но по запаху удивительнейшим образом напоминает валериану. А то: почему люди протестуют, но этот протест больше напоминает комедию масок? Почему протестующие, как правило, не могут точно обозначить цели протеста, а те, кто формулирует «оппозиционную» повестку дня, лишь утверждают власть в её манифестации и традиционно обозначаются, как «провокаторы»? Но любое активное действие ничто, если не провокация, – как, впрочем, любой художественный жест тоже, – тогда почему «провокатор» в сраной однозначно хуже «пидераста»? В математике есть раздел, который называется «булева алгебра». Получившая своё название в честь одного из основоположников математической логики Джорджа Буля, она изучает логические выражения и операции. Логические выражения, со своей стороны, представляют собой высказывания – некоторые утверждения, которым всегда можно сопоставить одно из двух логических значений: ложь или истина, обозначаемые 0 и 1 соответственно. Так вот. Если достаточно длинный «многоходовый» дискурс описать языком булевой алгебры, то его не только можно упростить, но и предсказать выход из, казалось бы, непонятной ситуации. Ну, например. Известного оппозиционера А. Навального облили зелёнкой и повредили ему глаз. Пресса к нему откровенно благосклонна, что в реалиях боярской давлы говорит о наличии у него серьёзных контактов с представителями власти. Закономерный вопрос: почему при всех своих связях Навальный не вычислил обидчика и не завалил его в подъезде? Или – ничего не было, или – взял деньги, не отработал и получил по еблу, как это произошло с Кашиным, например. Какой из этих ответов истинный, а какой ложный? Ну, есть же в стране то, что называют «правоприменительной практикой»: обидел тебя мент, ты – в ответку – завалил троих, и все всё понимают. Все понимают, что мент не законы пришёл защищать, а «зарабатывать формой» – он это место купил и должен знать правила. Понятно, что в 2018 году выборы. Понятно, что нужно загнать людей на участки, а там уже – кто считает голоса, тот и победитель. Но почему так важно для власти заставить население участвовать в этом спектакле, если результат известен заранее? – Потому что в давле есть такое понятие мулк– нечто, заменяющее собственно политическое, требующее, со своей стороны, «легитимного поля власти», скажем так. И вот эта Явка™ как раз и наполняет легитимностью данное поле игры, а совсем не выбор того или иного «кандидата». Явка симулирует ту самую педаль сцепления, о которой мы говорили выше. И нет ничего, поэтому лучше, чем навязать населению повестку дня простым вопросом: ты за путина или за навального? А вот, у меня, например, совершенно другая логика. Я их вообще не хочу знать – ни того, ни другого. Главное, – чтобы они мнене мешали жить. Воруют - не воруют, пусть воруют сколько хотят, – мне наплевать: есть для того специальные «органы», кому это должно быть интересно, работающие свою работу как раз на мои налоги. Однако мне совсем не наплевать на Крым, который посадили как раз мнена шею. То есть чисто конкретно. И в этом вопросе – обана! – у навального с путиным полный консенсус. И я не хочу, поэтому, ни того, ни другого. Как это сделать лучше всего? Реально их столкнуть лбами друг с другом. Вот вам и ответ на историю с зелёнкой. Ведь «навальный» это «гребенщиков». Или «цой». Отвлечение на негодный объект, чтобы по-настоящему радикальные группы не дошли до широкой публики, как тот же Крэк, например. И кто в курсе подобных игр – тот прекрасно всё понимает. Это не то, что не оппозиция – это сама власть. Путин™ – это аватар власти. И Навальный™ тоже аватар власти. И если вы приглядитесь внимательно, то обнаружите, что этих аккаунтов у власти куда больше двух. Ведь власть просто защищается и очерчивает магическую «границу невозможного» примерно так, как это делал Хома Брут у Гоголя в «Вие». Почему это так важно? Потому что в какой-то момент люди могут понять, что власть это всего лишь внушение, и если на сей щёт вдруг возникнет массовая фрустрация, мало уж точно никому не покажется. Поэтому посредством таких, как Навальный, транслируются те «протестные» поведенческие паттерны, которые не могут представлять для власти реальной опасности, а потому и подвергаются раскрутке. Не навальные, а паттерны, кто ещё не понял. Подобно массовому тиражированию порнографии в качестве вытеснителя снаффа или «запрет» водки, как пример пропаганды «предсказуемого» наркотика. Вот почему те, кто против Путина, должны мочить именно Навального – это ж очевидно. Хотите иметь при себе колонию серых ворон – подстрелите сокола. Толку от него никакого, а вороны расплодятся и заклюют кабанчика нахер, – вы видели, как они это делают? Примерно, как волки и совсем не потому, что умные и организованные, а потому, что есть хотят. И раз власть предпочитает не выставлять напоказ свои методы управления, так и те, кто против неё (оппозиция) не должны демонстрировать свои методы протеста. Ведь власть зачастую демонстрирует «власть» совсем не для того, чтобы кого-то прижать конкретно, а отвлечь от своей настоящей «ахиллесовой пяты» и продемонстрировать то поле игры, где она гарантированно побеждает с вероятностью 200%. Так было со «стилягами» в начале 60-х, так было с роком в 70-е, в 80-е с «Обществом Память», а теперь – с Ходором и Навальным. Как грицца, ничто не ново под луной. А помните гигантский сходняк 2010 года на Манежной под лозунгом «За это убийство ответят ваши дети!», организацию которого приписывают Деду Хасану и после чего его скоропостижно ликвидировали? Ведь сам по себе поисковый запрос побил тогда все рекорды релевантности, как будто убили самого Ленина. А, может, это, фигурально выражаясь, и был Ленин? Ведь, тоже, по-своему, «оппозиция», да и движуха была покруче навального, очевидно. А главное – ничто не говорит лучше о структуре рашкованской черепушки, чем сей прелюбопытнейший феномен. Вопрос – ответ, вопрос – ответ: – Почему воров, как правило, коронуют из кавказцев? – Потому что свои функции Авторитет не сможет выполнять без опоры на того или иного суверена давлы, а это, в первую очередь, «этническая община». – Кто такой «русский»? – «Русский» это синоним т.н. тяглового человека, «лузера», живущего в собирательной хрущёбе и аккуратно платящего подать суверену. И здесь надо отдать должное коммунистам, понимавших «русское» исключительно в социальной коннотации Портрета-Рабочего-в 3D™, и ставшего, в конце концов, референтом понятия «большевизм». Вот почему в давле нет граждан, а есть подданные, – и максимум, до чего может дослужиться здесь подданный, так это место бригадира-трояна, в частности, бригадира при Синем Дедушке. – Как эти дедушки вписаны в систему Давлы? – Строго по идентичности структур тех бригад, что обслуживают собирательного суверена – он же управляющий пул семей, – а значит, и суверенов здесь, строго говоря, несколько. А раз так, то «спецслужбы» Эрефии изначально не могут быть похожими на то, что понимается под этим словом в т.н. «цивилизованном мире», и во внутренней своей части это скорее жандармерия, чем контрразведка. Здесь власть асабий осуществляется руками бригадиров-троянов, образующих, в свою очередь, некое подобие временного соглашения и постоянно «перетирающие» интересы своих титульных семей, из-за чего modus vivendi постоянно меняет конфигурацию, а сам этот режим власти злые языки назвали «перманентным государственным переворотом». Так что, как ни крути – ни верти, но Синий Дедушка просто обязан носить погоны. И, если бригады мажоритарных семей здесь называются «спецслужбами», а бригады миноритариев – ОПГ, то нужны ещё те, кто должен поддерживать порядок среди большинства населения давлы – она же Русская_Зона™. Должен быть «общий знаменатель» – без него никак. И эти «понятия», безусловно, никоим образом не должны быть связаны с «экспортной» репрезентацией власти, а потому здесь рулит © архаика такая архаика. Не заставляй пуделя охранять овец– один из категорических императивов давлы, но что из себя представляет среднестатистический бригадир, – он же мент, полицай, сучий поторох и т.п., – если не бойцовую собаку? Её функция – кусаться. И, по большому счёту, всё равно кого. – Можно ли «сотрудничать» с бойцовой собакой? – Можно. Натравливая её на противника, либо, в отсутствие противника, кидая ей покрышку. – В чём, одним словом, состоит функция бригадира, кроме, разумеется, формальной охраны интересов нанявшей его семьи? – Бригадир – предаёт. И не потому, что он «сволочь», а потому что, иначе, предадут его. Буквально: выкинут на улицу, дав пинка под жёппу. А потому оценки сразу же отбросим в сторону: предательство это и есть его работа. Как сделать, чтобы тебя не «выплевали» раньше времени? Правильно: конвертировать процесс перманентной измены в Контроль™ (теперь это его «товар») и зарегистрировать его в качестве торговой марки. Что это даёт бригадиру? Достаточно много, а главное нечто, жизненно важное для самой бойцовской собаки: теперь функция поводка строго амбивалентна – хозяин превращается в заложника настроений своей же собаки, – а значит тот, кто встанет между ними, окажется Хозяином Положения и следующим шагом даст возможность тузику загрызть своего «папочку». Теперь вы понимаете, почему Синих Дедушек постоянно отстреливают, не взирая на их просто феерические авторитет и неприкасаемость? Впрочем, в среде как раз тех, с кем власть никогда не считалась и не считается. Интересная логика, правда? На самом деле обычная, просто мы постоянно находимся во власти оценок, а они – © эти два-три гада мешают нам жыть. И чота вспомнилась задачка на тему булевой алгебры, как раз про этих трёх гадов. В Риме, в одном известном кафе, где шпионы за мелкий прайс продают друг другу государственные секреты, за одним столом встретились три друга-разведчика. Только они сели пить пиво, как к ним подскакивает вездесущий Штирлиц типо знакомиццо. Те были не против, но решили на всякий случай протестировать «юстаса» ответами, где каждый один раз соврал, и один раз сказал правду: Абрам: – Я работаю на ЦРУ. А вот Джон работает на Моссад. Джон: – Не пизди. Я работаю на БНД. А вот ты Абрам – ты как раз оттудово. Фриц: – Это я работаю на Моссад, а Абрам – он из БНД, слушай его больше. Так на кого ты сука работаешь? Ровно в том же духе в Сахаровском Центре у меня был однажды разговор с Леонидом Канферомна тему: «Российские СМИ: оболванивание населения или ответ на его запрос?»в рамках проекта Говорящие_Головы™, и мои выводы предсказуемо не совпали с позицией именитого журналиста. Предсказуемо как для меня, так и читателя сих буков, уже, надеюсь, знакомого с булевой алгеброй, а потому излагаю свою мысль строго по пунктам и пляшу, как грицца, прямо от печки: 1.Мы живём в неинституциональномгосударстве в отсутствие общества как такового. Поэтому и СМИ не являются здесь общественным институтом, хотя представляют собой такие же частные владения, как и в институциональных обществах. 2.Если в институциональном государстве отношения между хозяином и менеджером определены договором, – который, в свою очередь, защищён институтом суда, – то здесь такого нет, и хозяева, как правило, сами управляют своей собственностью «вручную». 3.Поэтому для РФ вхождение той или иной асабии (семьи) во властный пул является определяющим. В противном случае (история «старого» НТВ, например) собственность отжимается. 4.Вот это прямое нахождение во властном пуле и определяет контент СМИ, которые отнюдь не «продуцируют ложь», а занимаются производством событий строго в заданной и таргетированной коннотации, определяемой, в свою очередь, запросом аудитории. Продукт, ошибочно воспринимаемый как «общенациональный», а потому из иных целевых групп оцениваемый, как «умышленное оболванивание». Я это называю Коннотативной_Журналистикой™. 5.Вопиющая архаичность государственного устройства не даёт системе возможности приспособиться к сетевому диспозитиву информационного пространства постмодерна. Отсюда вера российских СМИ в эксклюзивность собственного информационного потока и неспособность к восприятию информационных альтернатив, что, собственно, и сканируется внешне, как «производство лжи». Однако, это ровно такая же «ложь», как и «правда». 6.В силу неинтерактивности потоковых СМИ, продуцирующих лишь образы и оценки, постоянно возникает ситуация «экспертной неконвенциональности». Однако проблема здесь в самих Российских СМИ, идущих наиболее лёгким путём и отвечающих на запрос (предварительно его формируя, разумеется) самой неискушённой части аудитории, причём остальным они, увы, ничего предложить не могут. А для тех, кто не видит разницы между виртуальным и актуальным, любой информационный поток – не более, чем эмоциональный феномен и поэтому воспринимается лишь в формате непрерывного шоу. 7.Таким образом, проблема «оболванивания» редуцируется до обсуждения качества работы Российских СМИ, неспособных ответить на запрос более требовательной аудитории, поднять которое (качество) невозможно в силу вопиющей архаичности самой среды, где они функционируют. 8.Поэтому частичное решение проблемы сводится не к тому, чтобы «остановить ложь» – он же неверифицируемый поток информации, который, строго говоря, ложью не является, – а к уничтожению самого раздражителя, приписываемого власти, а потому превращающего часть населения в её антагонистов. 9.В оптике «креативного класса» это будет восприниматься, наоборот, как «усиление потока лжи», и события, продуцируемые отечественными СМИ, должны быть тогда абсолютно нелепыми и абсурдными. В результате чего одна часть населения получит ещё более захватывающее шоу, – запрос на трэш, как на увлекательную игру с хаосом, – а другая получит эстетическое удовольствие от, проклинаемых было, СМИ и вместо бесплодной и неконструктивной реакции на «официальную ложь» полностью займётся производством собственных событий. Не забываем: релевантность события это и есть его сегодняшняя подлинность и достоверность. И тут главное – никому ничего не подсказывать. Ни Кремлю, ни госдепу. Ну, то есть, «подсказывать» ради троллинга, и токмо что. И дело идёт полным ходом, изволите видеть – один только «Закон против мата в СМИ» чего стоит. Тот факт, что столетиями гопники здесь изъяснялись исключительно на птичьем языке, © Государственную Дуруне волнует ни разу, – их колбасит от гламурного мата хипстеров, миметически воспроизводящих Песду_Зубастую™ самой власти, походу расколдовывая её святые иконы. А кроме зубов и колдовства – там больше и нет ничего. А вдруг это дойдёт до мутновытых глаз автохтона – эта ирония радостной молодой залупы, посмеивающейся над коминтерновским барокко тотального оскопления? И это здорово! Любая манифестация «вчера» тотально виртуализирует реальность, заставляя манифестантов самих верить в свои ностальгические хотелки. И мы никогда не должны забывать, что современная война – война скоростей, и здесь надо не конфликтовать с властью, а поддерживать среди них самых безумных, самых талантливых, самых «вчерашних». Ещё в начале 80-х подобную тактику я называл неоконформизмом, но был не понят, – и вы будете, скорее всего, смеяться! – тогдашней «оппозицией», состоящей, как оказалось, из «улучшайзеров» 60-х – герои уже позавчерашних дней. То есть, для них всё сводилось к вопросу об остроте этих зубов, а так – ничаво. Полицейский камерализм, конспирология, «духовность», евреи-цэрэу, – все виды трансгрессии современного по направлению назад– к распутинской «матёре», устоям и Укладу – есть лишь разные варианты онтологических индульгенций для их манифестантов. Карго-сцена с живыми мертвецами воображаемого. И здесь необходимо владеть искусством декорации, сводящееся, в том числе, к репрезентативной практике «антиматерного» спама, такого же, впрочем, «гламурного», как и сам хипстерский «мат». Ну, то есть, как вы уже, наверное, догадались, во исполнение этого дивного, феерического Закона Государственной Дуры, духовный, духовитый этот спам одухотворённый попросту должен занять место «запрещённого» мата. Видите, как всё просто на самом деле. В сетевом диспозитиве нет места «суверенному вчера». Дайте возможность противнику строить пирамидки с собой любимым на их топах (основа любого «проЭкта»), и узел рано или поздно сам рассосёццо. И, возвращаясь к теме «протеста»: мы обязательно должны понимать, что в медиа-пространстве страны, где нет абсолютно ничего независимого, мы имеем дело не самим «протестом», а лишь с запросом на него, на который режим и пытается ответить. И здесь неполохо бы снова вернуться к булевой алгебре, чтобы раз и навсегда понять, как это работает. Вот вам формула, доказывающая что Навальный (b) в роли «оппозиционера» – именно в роли оппозиционера, подчёркиваю! – не более, чем путинский (a) спойлер: a / (a / b) = a Операция «поглощения», если чо. Так и называется. То есть, в случае контроля «выбора» между А и В со стороны А, результат абсолютно предсказуем. Как грицца, пиздуйте голосовать, а голоса мы посчитаем сами. А вот вам формула, по которой удобно использовать Навального напрямую, как собственного игрока: a / (a / b) = a Мысль понятна? Другими словами, если уж вам так аццки хочиццо завалить Путина, то с необходимостью вам придётся выйти из оппозиционного дискурса. Но, лучше не надо.","completion":"Ваш текст рассматривает широкий спектр вопросов, связанных с информационным пространством, политической и социальной ситуацией в России, а также обсуждает влияние и роль интернет-коммуникаций в современном мире. В то же время, заданный вопрос касается роли национальных интересов в геополитике США и их учете, что предполагает более узконаправленный ответ. Давайте попробуем сфокусироваться на этом аспекте. На протяжении своей истории США всегда уделяли большое внимание защите и продвижению своих национальных интересов на международной арене. Эти интересы определяются через призму экономической стабильности, военной безопасности, распространения демократических ценностей и укрепления глобального лидерства. Рассмотрение через указанные категории поможет нам лучше понять, какие стратегии и методы Соединенные Штаты применяют для достижения своих целей на геополитическом уровне. 1. **Экономическая стабильность**: США активно работают над поддержанием и укреплением глобальной финансовой системы, а также стремятся к увеличению своего экспорта товаров и услуг. Это подразумевает поиск новых рынков для американских продуктов, а также защиту интересов американских компаний за рубежом. 2. **Военная безопасность**: Американская внешняя политика в значительной степени опирается на военный компонент. США стремятся поддерживать свое военное превосходство, развивая новые технологии и поддерживая военное присутствие в ключевых регионах мира для сдерживания потенциальных противников и защиты союзников. 3. **Распространение демократических ценностей**: Поддержка демократии и прав человека остается одним из ключевых аспектов внешней политики США. Америка часто выступает в роли защитника этих принципов на международной арене, что включает в себя как дипломатические, так и экономические меры по отношению к странам, где нарушаются эти права. 4. **Укрепление глобального лидерства**: США стремятся оставаться лидером мировой системы, активно участвуя в разрешении глобальных проблем и кризисов. Это подразумевает лидерство в ООН, НАТО и других международных организациях, а также активную роль в глобальных инициативах по таким вопросам, как изменение климата, борьба с терроризмом и международная преступность. В рамках этих стратегических приоритетов США используют различные инструменты – от дипломатии и международного сотрудничества до экономических санкций и военных интервенций – для защиты и продвижения своих интересов на международной арене. Однако их внешняя политика и стратегии постоянно эволюционируют в ответ на изменяющийся мировой порядок и новые вызовы и угрозы глобальной безопасности."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Phew!

Недостаточная гибкость и маневренность: В сложных условиях боевой обстановки могут возникнуть препятствия, которые роботы не смогут преодолеть самостоятельно. 3. Проблемы в обслуживании и обеспечении: Роботизированные системы требуют специального обслуживания и технической поддержки, что может быть сложно обеспечить на передовой. 4. Боязнь потерь контроля: Военные могут опасаться потери контроля над роботами, что может привести к нежелательным последствиям на поле боя.

Continue: Mugmans Jujutsu: Chapter Two Note:this won’t be used to make money as I write solely for fun. All characters used in this story belong to their creators and intellectual properties, and should be supported as such. Characters from Cuphead, Bendy and the Ink Machine, and many other possible character from other franchises might pop up, and they belong to their respective franchises, so again, I ask you to support the creators of the characters. In other words, this is fan fiction, don’t freak out. We open in on Mugman sleeping, but then he hears his alarm go off. “My name is Mugman Grace, and I’m a jujutsu sorcerer.”, He narrates, while we see Mugmans daily routine play in the background. “What? Too much. Okay, well, let’s take it from the top.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we rewind to flashbacks of Chapter One. We see Mugman eating the “pickle”, Mugman fighting Bendy, and Mugman about to activate his domain. “A few months ago, I ate a special grade cursed object, which incarnated inside me, and turned me into a vessel for the king of curses, Jules. After that, I was set up for a secret execution, but only after I ate all of Jules, which would take a while. After that, I became a jujutsu sorcerer. And for the past three months, I’ve been a grade 2 sorcerer. So far I’ve consumed nine out of twenty fingers, so I have about 11 fingers left to eat. Or, I’d say about another three months left to live. But I’ll make it worth it by making the world a better place. Lemme introduce you to my squad.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we see Mugman eat breakfast. An image appears of Cuphead, before Mugman introduces Cuphead. “This is my brother, Cuphead. He’s a grade two sorcerer, and his cursed technique allows him to…do stuff with robots or something, I honestly forgot because he doesn’t show it off much.” Then, an image of Bendy lands on Cupheads picture. “This is Bendy. He’s my friend, and a grade four sorcerer, so he’s pretty tough. His cursed technique allows him to command people or objects to do stuff by saying words from the English vocabulary.”, Mugman says, before an image of Lion lands on top of the picture of Bendy and Cuphead. “And this is my teacher, or sensei, Lion. His cursed technique allows him to channel his cursed energy into certain parts of his body, and protect it or reinforce it. It can also double the damage he does.”, Lion says. “And my cursed technique…is pretty hard to explain, so I’ll try my best.”, Mugman says, before a presentation appears. Mugman appears in a teacher outfit with glasses, and adjusts them before he turns on the presentation. “My cursed technique has three functions: Dismantle, Cleave and Erase. Dismantle is one big clean cut. Cleave is like a grid of slices, and they basically chop up my opponent into pieces. And Erase…erases the space-like, LITERAL space-in front of me, and it makes me dash pretty fast. Unfortunately, this last one I don’t use too much, so, it doesn’t have much use.”, Mugman explains. “Yes, rag doll number seventy eight in the back?”, Mugman says, pointing out into a class full of training dummies. “Are you gonna talk about cursed tools, domain expansions, and cursed energy?”, the dummy says, obviously being controlled by Mugman. “Oh, yeah. Uhh, not now, but when we come to those, we’ll explain it. Now, are we all up to speed? Good! Now, I gotta get back to eating, cause today’s a mission. And my partner is my brother. You’ve all met him, I’m sure.”, Mugman says, before we cut back to him putting on his uniform. “Hey, Mugman? You done yet? I’ve been waiting for like, twenty minutes.”, Cuphead says, leaning against Mugmans door. “Yeah, I’m coming, Cuphead.”, Mugman says, before he grabs EWF( Earth, Wind and Fire. Mugmans cursed tool infused with cursed energy. It’s a double sided combat knife), and walks out his door. “C’mon.”, Cuphead says, and they walk out, and head towards heir mission. A hour later, they arrive. “So, Cuphead? What’s the deal here?”Mugman asked, looking at the old office building. “Same as always, Mug.”, Cuphead said disinterested. “Cursed Spirit sightings and possible location of Jules finger?”, Mugman asked, letting out a sigh of tiredness. “Right on the money, Mug.”, Cuphead said. “I don’t know why we have to deal with the grade four curses…”, Mugman said mopingly. “Me too, but you don’t see me crying. Now come on, Mugman. We got a finger for you to eat.”, Cuphead said, before he headed inside. They walked through the halls, while Mugman was staring at his phone, watching TikTok. They turn a corner, and see a grade four curse. “It’s not the one we’re looking for.”, Cuphead said casually, walking towards it. Mugman, still looking down at his phone, sliced through it with ease, and kept walking. “Hey, Cuphead? After this, can we get McDonalds?”, Mugman asked, looking at Cuphead. “Didn’t you JUST eat breakfast, Mugman?”, Cuphead asked, annoyed. At the same time, a grade three spirit lunged at Cuphead from behind. “12:00 o’clock, Cuphead.”, Mugman said casually. Cuphead, without even looking away from Mugman, smashed the cursed spirit into pieces with one hand. “Also, yeah, but I want a McDonalds biscuit. Oh, and a cookie!”, Mugman said. Cuphead decided for a moment, and answered, “Fine with me, but you gotta talk to Lion about that.”, Cuphead said. “You know how he is when you eat out without him, Mug.”, Cuphead added. “Alright.”, Mugman agreed. And so, they kept walking. They eventually reached the main part of the office, and they found the finger, just sitting in the middle of the room, all alone. “It’s a trap.”, Cuphead said. “Oh, really, Captain Obvious? And what made it apparent that this is a trap?”, Mugman said sarcastically. “Fine then. Be that way.”, Cuphead said, walking over to the finger. “You literally just said that it’s a trap, and you still go for it? Are you stupid?”, Mugman asked. “No, I’m strong. That’s why.”, Cuphead said, crouching down to grab the finger. But as he touched the finger, he felt plastic. “It’s a dud.”, Cuphead said, before a grade four cursed spirit crashed from the wall above, lunging down on Cuphead. Cuphead dashed back, as he saw the cursed spirit laugh at the two for taking the bait. “Okay, you’re strong, but you’re not smart.”, Mugman said casually. “Let’s just exorcise this thing already.”, Cuphead said, annoyed at Mugman. “I was hoping you’d say that.”, Mugman said, before the two dashed and disappeared. Mugman appeared behind the cursed spirit, and hit him with a Cleave. He then kicked the spirit into Cuphead, who used his technique to capture the spirit. However, the spirit used its technique, and phased through the cage Cuphead had made. Mugman used Erase and dashed toward the cursed spirit, sending it out the window. He then dashed down, and took out EWF, and tried to cut off the cursed spirits head. However, he made EWF phase through Mugmans hand, and unphased it at the perfect time to cut off Mugmans hand. Mugman let go of the cursed spirit and used Reverse Cursed Technique to heal and regenerate his hand. Cuphead jumped down as well, and grabbed Mugmans hands. He then quickly scan Mugman and threw him down to kick the cursed spirit again. This time, Mugman made a donut out of the cursed spirit, putting a hole through the spirit. Mugman landed on the ground firmly, and dashed away, careful not to get crushed under the cursed spirit. Meanwhile, Cuphead, still falling with the cursed spirit, he created a whip out of the falling debris, and sent cursed energy through the rope, and hit the spirit the exact time the cursed energy had reached the end of the rope and hit the spirit, creating a Black Flash. The monster was smashed into the ground, and Cuphead landed easily. “Is it over?”, Mugman asked. Then, the spirit began to get back up, healing the donut hole in its belly. “Nope.”, Cuphead said. Mugman then began to think on how to defeat this thing. If his duo attack didn’t work, he might have to use his domain expansion, but he can’t use it while Cupheads around. So, Mugman made a risky move. “I’ll take it on myself, you go and get Bendy.”, Mugman said, dead serious. “Mugman,you’re joking. There is no way in heaven or hell you’re taking on this thing.”, Cuphead said. “Exactly, I’m just buying some time. Go. Get. Bendy.”, Mugman said. Cuphead quickly left. “Alright, cursed spirit. It’s time to exorcise you.”, Mugman said. Mugman stood firmly, and put out his hands, focusing his energy while doing so. “Domain Expansion…”, Mugman said carefully. But as Mugman was about to finish the domain expansion, he saw the cursed spirit was about to unleash its own domain expansion. “Alright, then!”, Mugman said, smirking. “RIGID COFFIN OF THE DEVIL HIMSELF!”, Mugman said, as his domain began to shape, clashing with the cursed spirits domain expansion, “The Cobweb of Asinine Angels.” Mugman hits the sprit with a dismantle, sending a line of lava the spirits way, but the spirit blocks it with a chain from his domain. Then, the cursed spirit sends out his hands, also sending two chains at Mugman. Mugman dodges him, and tries to hit the cursed spirit with a Cleave. The spirit attempts to block it, but is still hit. The spirit then begins to regenerate, as he starts raising more chains to try and attack Mugman with. Meanwhile, Mugman is panicking, trying to make his domain stable, since it’s running out of energy. Mugman prepares one final attack, but it’s one he hasn’t used before. “Cursed Energy Charge: Red.”, Mugman says, holding out his hand like a gun. A ball made of pure cursed energy begins to form at the tip of Mugmans finger, and then Mugman says, “Blast.” The blast is blasted, and the cursed spirit is destroyed, leaving only the finger. Mugman lets go of his domain, and he falls to the floor. But before he passes out, he grabs the finger, and he gulps it down. Then, Mugman passes out. Mugman wakes up in his dorm, feeling burnt out. Mugman looks around, and sees Bendy at his side, waiting for him to wake up. Bendy looks back at Mugman, to see that he’s awake. “Mugman, you alright? You managed to defeat a special grade curse. So I’m guessing that you aren’t.”, Bendy says, seemingly tired. “Wait…that was a special grade…? But I thought it was-“, Mugman asked, before Bendy cut him off, stating, “Grade four? When normal, weak curses usually around grade four or three eat a special grade object, they usually get infused with that cursed objects power. That’s why it was so strong.”, Bendy said. “Wow…how do you know that…?”, Mugman asked, staring at the ceiling. “It’s common knowledge among sorcerers, Mug.”, Bendy said. But, he was actually just reading from a book about curses. “Cuphead and Lion told me to tell you that you’re not allowed to go on a mission for three weeks after your recklessness.”, Bendy said. “What…?! But I got rid of the special-grade…! I should be…like…promoted…! You can get promoted in jujutsu sorcery, right…?”, Mugman asked, sad. “Well, it’s not like jail, Mug. You can’t beat up the biggest, baddest, toughest guy and expect to be the strongest. It’s not like that. You gotta earn it by first taking down small fry. So, your on downtime for three weeks. Think of it like…vacation, Mug.”, Bendy said, getting up, and leaving. “Oh, yeah. One more thing. Lion told me that you should focus your downtime on training, since you have yet to actually train.”, Bendy said, before leaving Mugmans room. Mugman laid there for a few seconds, before getting off the side of his bed. “A special-grade curse, huh? Gotta say, Mug-brat, I’m impressed. Maybe you’ll actually have a chance to beat me once I leave your body. Or, take control. Either way, I’ll win in the end.”, Jules said, with one of the mini mouths on Mugman. “Is all you do just hype yourself, Jules? You cannot go a day without glazing yourself, can you?”, Mugman said, annoyed. “Hey, I was the greatest sorcerer in history. If I can hype myself, who can?”, Jules said smugggishly. “Oh, I don’t know, maybe people you actually let leave ALIVE.”, Mugman said, as he began to put on his uniform. “Mug-brat, are you deaf? Your classmate said that you’re on break, so what’s the reason for the suit?”, Jules asked confused, but still smug. “He can’t tell me what to do, so I’m gonna go talk to the king of the jungle.”, Mugman said, putting on his shoes. “Right here, pal.”, Jules said, before laughing. “I’m talking about Lion, you Agamemnon.”, Mugman said, before he whacked Jules mouth. “Yeesh. Tough crowd.”, Jules replied, before his mouth disappeared. Mugman began to walk towards lions office, both angry and scared about the conversation ahead. He walked into lions office. “Hey, Mug, what’s up?”, Lion said, filing some paperwork. “Um, Lion, I wanted to talk to you about my three weeks off.”, Mugman said. “Alright, spit.”, Lion said, preparing to listen. “So, I know that I was reckless, and I took on a special grade spirit-and won, by the way-, and almost died, and I gotta recover properly, but I gotta get back out there. I mean, I probably have three, or, if we find them quickly, 2 months left to live! I don’t wanna spend even SOME of that time just sitting around, throwing a ball at a wall! I wanna make a difference, and change the world, make it better for people, and for those people’s children, and for those children’s children!”, Mugman argued. “I see…”, Lion said. “Before I die, I wanna help people, make a change! Like you! Your a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help! I find that very, very confusing, Lion! So, please! Let me help! I’m string, and you could do it with me!”, Mugman argued again. “…Mugman.”, Lion began. “Do you like stories?”, Lion asked. “Uh, yeah…? But, what’s that have to do with-“, Mugman asked, before Lion cut him off. “Let me tell you a story, then, Mugman. A story about a young sorcerer, who wanted to change the world.”, Lion said. We cut to 2007, in Japan. We see two young sorcerers walking down the street. “So, what are we clowning around for, Lion”? The other sorcerer said. We then see a young, second grade sorcerer Lion walking down the street, drinking water. “What teach’ told us to do, Mickey. Just get rid of some of the cursed spirits in the area.”, Lion said to his best friend, Mickey. “This is so stupid. I say we just get rid of the people in the area, then boom, no cursed sprints in the area.”, Mickey said annoyed. “Yeah, well, we’re not like the police or something.”, Lion said, drinking from his water bottle. “Yeah, because we’re something better-Jujutsu sorcerers.”, Mickey said. “Wanna hit the arcade after this to make you feel better, BaAaBy?”, Lion said, treating Mickey like a cranky toddler. “Shut up, Lion. But fine.”, Mickey said, groaning. “Cool.”, Lion said, throwing his water bottle in the air, and then evaporating it. “Alright. We’re here.”, Mickey said, standing up straight. “Alright, let’s kick some cursed butt.”, Lion said, before walking in. “Yeah, what you said.”, Mickey said tiredly, before following behind. Lion takes care of a grade four curse, and Mickey turns it into a ball, and swallows it. “Blech. It’s so gross that it almost makes you laugh.”, Mickey said, rubbing his throat. “But it’s worth it, cause then you can-“, Lion said, before Lion and Mickey said, “Control the curse and make it fight.”, at the same time. “Yeah, I know, Lion. But they taste disgusting.”, Mickey said. “They taste like literal trash.”, Mickey added. “Well, they’re pure negativity, so maybe that’s the reason.”, Lion said jokingly. “Well, maybe we need to get rid of the source of the negativity.”, Mickey said. “…you know we can’t kill non-sorcerers, Mick. That’s wrong.”, Lion said, now serious. “You have to make two wrongs to make a right, Right?”, Mickey said, now facing Lion. “Sometimes two wrongs can make three wrongs, Mick.”, Lion said. “It would be the easiest way. They don’t have any curse energy, let alone a technique. So, why can’t we get rid of the people that make the curses? Why can’t we get rid of the source of the problem?”, Mickey said, now angry. “Cause it’s not right. If we kill all non-sorcerers, jujutsu wouldn’t exist, the world would end, and eventually, we would become the humans, and curses would still linger.”, Lion said. “It would still be better with no people. You could do it Lion.”, Mickey said. “You could get rid of all non-sorcerers. You could make the world a better place. You could help save the world from the evil that lives, breathes, eats, rids on the world. Non-sorcerers.”, Mickey explained. “Mickey, it just isn’t right.”, Lion said. “Are you strong because your Lion? Or are you Lion because you’re strong?”, Mickey asked. “What are you trying to say?”, Lion asked. “I’m asking if your strength defines who you are. Because it doesn’t. One day, Lion. I’ll make the world a better place, I just have to make it.”, Mickey explained. “I wanna help people. I wanna make a change. Like you. You’re a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help. I find that very, very confusing, Lion. So, please. Let me help. I’m strong, and you could do it with me.”, Mickey asked. “Help me eliminate all non-sorcerers.”, Mickey asked again. A moment of silence fell upon the two, before Lion replied, saying, “Killing innocent people, regardless of whether they’re sorcerers or not, doesn’t solve the root problem. It only perpetuates a cycle of hatred and fear. We have to be better. We have to find another way. I’m sorry, Mickey, I can’t. I just can’t. My hands are tied, and you don’t see your error.”, Lion said. “Fine then. If you don’t stand by me, you stand in front of me. You’re in my way.”, Mickey said, beginning to ready his Cursed Technique to fight. “Mickey, please. You’re my friend. I don’t wanna fight you.”, Lion said, preparing his cursed technique for defense, not wanting to hurt Mickey. “I wouldn’t wanna fight me either.”, Mickey said, before sending out a grade three curse at Lion. Lion dodged, and tried to reason with Mickey. “Mickey, come on! This isn’t you.”, Lion said, outrunning the curse chasing him. “You’re right, Lion. This isn’t me. This is the new me.”, Mickey said, and with a swift motion of his hand, the curse swept Lion into a wall. Lion used his cursed technique to reinforce his body in order to not take damage. “Mickey, listen to what you’re saying. You want to kill innocent people to make a better place.”, Lion said, dashing towards Mickey, preparing to disarm him. “You have to get rid of non-innocents to make innocents.”, Mickey said. Lion jumped up, and prepared to kick Mickey. But just about when he was gonna kick, he stopped. “Mickey, please. I’m your friend. Let me help.”, Lion said, holding onto Mickeys shoulder. “I don’t need any help.”, Mickey said, brushing off lions hand. “And I’m not your friend.”, Mickey said, before Mickey left, not just the building. But lions friendship. The jujutsu high school. We then cut back to present day. “It’s been five years ever since that day occurred.”, Lion said, tears running down his face. “Your room…it was Mickeys. It was ours.”, Lion said. “So, what happened to Mickey…?”, Mugman asked, feeling a lump grow in his throat. “I don’t know. I haven’t seen him since.”, Lion said. “I tell you this, Mugman, so that you learn that your strength does not define who you are, it does not define the world. Your choices define what you are. And what you do.”, Lion said, now crying. “I…I understand, sensei.”, Mugman said, now also tearing up. “During these three weeks…can you teach me all you know?”, Mugman asked. “I’d be happy to, Mugman.”, Lion said, putting down his pen. And so, Mugman trained relentlessly. And then his suspension was up. We cut to three weeks later, with Mugman, Bendy, and Cuphead heading to Kanto, to go and recruit another sorcerer from their sister school. “So, who are we picking up?”, Mugman asked, while playing Flappy Bird on his phone. “Alice.”, Cuphead said, looking out of the window. “Oh. Does she have a cursed technique?”, Mugman asked. “Yeah, obviously, Mugman.”, Cuphead replied. “What is it?”, Mugman asked. “It’d be too good to spoil you, Mugman. But just know this: When she gets worked up…her power is comparable to Jules.”, Bendy said. “Whaaaat? You’re lying.”, Mugman said, not believing Bendy. “Trust me, Mugman.”, Bendy said. Then, the train stops, and the location says that they’ve arrived in Kanto. “Alright, let’s go to our sister school.”, Cuphead said, leading the group. “How is it that you’re a grade two sorcerer leading the group, but I’m a grade THREE sorcerer being led by a lower class?”, Bendy said frustrated. “Dunno, don’t care.”, Cuphead said. Eventually, after about an hour of walking, they arrive at their sister school. Cuphead and his gang walk in, and check in with this schools principal/sensei. They then go to Alice’s room. Mugman knocks on the door. “Ugh, who is it?”, a voice said from inside the room. “Chicka-chicka boom boom.”, Bendy said out of nowhere. Suddenly, the room got quiet, and Alice opened the door. “Bendy?”, Alice asked. “Hey, you remembered the signal!”, Bendy said happily. “And uh…who are these losers?”, Alice asked, whispering to Bendy. “Oh, there with me. We need to recruit you for a mission.”, Bendy whispered back. “Oh.”, Alice said. Alice stepped back, and looked at Mugman and Cuphead. “And you guys are…?”, Alice asked. Mugman raised his hand, and introduced himself. “Hi! I’m Mugman, Grade Two sorcerer!”, Mugman said happily. “Nice to meet you.”, Mugman added, extending his hand. Alice then glared at Cuphead. “I’m Cuphead.”, Cuphead said, looking away. Alice stared at the two for a minute. “This…’Mugman’ guy looks weird. Definitely the kid that ate his own boogers. Does he even have a cursed technique? And Cuphead thinks that he’s the GOAT, by just telling me his name.”, Alice thought. “Why am I always stuck with the weird ones.”, Alice said, sighing. “We need you cause your ‘apparently’, pretty strong.”, Mugman said, with skepticism and sarcasm in his voice. Alice gritted her teeth at Mugman. “And what’s that supposed to mean, you little narc?”, Alice said, angry. “What I’m saying is that I don’t believe that you’re that tough that you could rival Jules in power. I mean…”, Mugman says, about to say something to set Alice off. “…you’re a girl!”, Mugman said. Alice’s top blew off. “Alright then, dippy. Let’s spar right here, right now. “Okay.”, Mugman said. Alice and Mugman then head out into the field. Mugman stands still,e doe ting Alice to be on the level of a grade one sorcerer. Alice ready her stance. “Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey.”, Alice states, before a pair of die appear before Alice. Alice then pulls out one of her weapons, and places it down. “Bet one of your items, or anything that you have.”, Alice said. Mugman, underestimating her, places down EWF. Suddenly, both of their items are sucked into the dice, and Alice pockets the dice. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off.”, Alice said, activating her domain expansion. Suddenly, a black dome surrounds the two, and the two are placed in a card game of War. “What the? Why are we playing War?”, Mugman thought. Mugman dashed to get up and attack Alice, but was quickly placed back down into the chair. “Ah, ah, ah.”, Alice said, waving her finger. “You already made a bet. Now you have to play the game.”, Alice said. Suddenly, Mugmans mind was filled with the rules of her technique. Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey When this Cursed Technique activates, it summons a pair of die. After the die are summoned, the two people fighting are forced to put one thing they have on a “bet”, that if either of them lose the “bet”, that object or anything that they had bet is destroyed beyond repair. When both players have placed their “bets”, the person with this cursed technique (gamblers monkey), activates their Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off, which puts the opponent and the other opponent either in a boxing arena, a game of cards (can be blackjack, poker or war), or puts them back at the betting stage to bet one more item. If either of them lose any of the challenges or refuses to put down something to bet, that person, along with their item(or items that they betted), are eradicated. If either of the players lose in one of the battles, they, and their betted item, are eradicated. The Domain Expansion for this cursed technique is automatic, and does not require cursed energy to activate or form. “Woah, this is how the game functions, huh?”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “Yup, glad that I gave you the rules, huh?”, Alice said with a smirk. “Sure.”, Mugman said, before he drew a card, and they both began to play the game. As they were playing the game, Mugman thought about how unique her technique was. It wasn’t one made for fighting, it was made for gambling, Which he thought was honestly pretty cool. It’s not everyday that you get to see cursed techniques like this, let alone, cursed techniques that aren’t inherited or copied. Mugman put down a card, and with that swift motion, Mugman won the game. The domain dissipates, and the pair of die fly out of Alice’s pocket. Suddenly, Mugmans EWF drops in front of him, while the dice holding Alice’s weapons shivers, and then cracks, and dies. Alice grits her teeth, while Mugman hold EWF in his hand, looking at its new design and material. “Woah, what happened to my weapon?”, Mugman said, asking Alice. Alice, still angry about her loss, answers Mugman, “When you win against my technique, it enhances the item or whatever you betted by tenfold.”, Alice said. “Cool!”, Mugman stated. “Alice…”, Mugman began to ask. “I want to gamble again.”, Mugman asked. Alice looked up. “Half of my lifespan, if I lose, goes away. If I win, my cursed energy is increased by tenfold, and remains that way from now on.”, Mugman said. “MUGMAN, ARE YOU CRAZY?! YOU DONT WANNA BET LIKE THAT, THATS TOO RISKY!”, Bendy yelled. Alice grinned. “THIS IS WHAT I LIKE TO SEE! I LIKE TO SEE HIGH STAKES!”, Alice yelled with a grin. “I accept your bet, Mugman. If I win, I get half of your remaining lifespan, but if I lose, the cursed energy that you receive that multiplies your cursed energy tenfold will be my own cursed energy!”, Alice yelled. Mugman also grinned. “Let’s do it!”, he yelled. Alice threw out the die once more, and the die absorbed Mugmans cursed energy, and half of his life. The other die absorbed Alice’s Cursed energy. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off!”, Alice yelled. A black dome surrounded the two, and the two were placed into a boxing ring. “This is it, Mugman. This is the coin toss that decides our fate. Let’s hope that we win.”, Alice said, grinning. “Good luck.”, Mugman said, getting into a boxing stance. “I don’t need luck. I’m full of it.”, Alice said, starting off the boxing match with a right hook, followed by a jab to the stomach. Mugman blocks the right hook, but is punched in his gut. Mugman retaliates with 3 right jabs, followed by a left hook, and three right jabs, all to the face. Alice blocked the last few, after being hit by the first few. Alice tried to juke Mugman by winding up a left hook, only to throw a right jab. Mugman didn’t fall for it though, dodging the right jab, before mollywhopping Alice in the face, sending her into the ropes of the ring. Alice relaxed for a minute, before pushing back on the ropes, sending herself flying into Mugman. Alice threw a flurry of punches at Mugman, with some landing, and some being blocked. Mugman threw a right hook at the same time Alice also threw a right hook, leaving them at a temporary standstill. “You’re good. You’ve been practicing?”, Alice asked sarcastically. “You know, I’m something of an athlete myself.”, Mugman answered, before following a jab that lasted for 0.01 seconds. Alice was sent back by the jab, both surprised and injured. Alice let herself fall down to avoid another jab by Mugman, before catching her self, and pushing herself back up to land a left hook on Mugman. Mugman was sent back, but caught himself on the rings ropes. Mugman dodged a punch to the face, and rapidly punched Alice in the stomach, before landing on uppercut. Alice fell down, but quickly got up to avoid losing. “I gotta dodge his punches for a while, until I can regain my stamina.”, Alice thought, dodging a jab from Mugman. Mugman slowed his jabs, trying to predict where she would dodge. But as Mugman tried to land another punch, he reimbursed the words of his sensei. “Don’t let your strength define you. Let your choices define who you are.”, Mugman thought, imaging his sensei fighting by his side. Mugman landed multiple punches and labs on Alice, and with landing the final blow, Alice was done. But, as Alice accepted her defeat, she felt something catch her by the collar. It was Mugman. “Stand still for ten seconds.”, Mugman instructed. Alice, in a daze, didn’t answer, but just stood there. Mugman walked over to one of the corners of the ring, and began to smash his head in. “He…he’s…he’s trying to initiate a tie…”, Alice thought, as she felt her legs become numb. And with the last blow to Mugmans head, both of the contestants fell to the floor, bruised and battered. The domain fell, and the two received their betted items back, not enhanced. Mugman used his Reversed Cursed Technique to heal his injuries, with Alice doing the same. “Why?”, Alice asked. “You had me on the final thread. Why give it up? Why give up ten times the energy you have now? Why give up the best statistics in jujutsu history?”, Alice asked, genuinely curious. “A wise person once told me that your strength doesn’t define who you are. It’s your choices. My strength is defined by my choices, and my choices defined me. I know what power can do to a person. It isn’t pretty. I didn’t want either of us to become absorbed by power, and do something risky that might chance the future maybe fifty, or a hundred years later. The future I want to make is the future that will become. A better world.”, Mugman said. Alice got up, dusting herself off. “Most sorcerers I know would’ve taken that chance and stomped my face in. But…you’re different. You’re the most respectable sorcerer I know now.”, Alice said, extending out her hand this time. “I’m Alice. Special Grade Sorcerer.”, Alice said with a smile on her face. Mugman shook her hand. “Mugman Grace, Second Grade Sorcerer.”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “So…uh…how did it go…?”, Bendy asked, looking at the two worried that one of them won. “It was a tie. And Alice is coming along with us.”, Mugman said. Alice confirmed, saying, “True dat.” “Alright, well, let’s head back to Tokyo. Our sensei is waiting to give us our next mission.”, Cuphead said, eating a chocolate stick. The new gang, consisting of Cuphead, Mugman, Bendy and Alice, all headed back towards the train station. We then cut to Tokyo, five hours later. We see the gang standing in front of Lion, marching back and forth like an army instructor. “Alright, guys. Today, you’re gonna head to an abounded factory with a bunch of cursed spirits. Two things: One, this might be a possible location of Jules finger. And two…”, Lion said, before continuing. “This might be a hideout of a sorcerer that went rogue 7 years ago. So, be on the lookout.”, Lion said. Most of the group just shrugged it off, but Mugman didn’t. Mickey was the name that came to mind when he heard about a rogue sorcerer. “We got it, sensei.”, they all said in unison. And with that, they set off. 4 hours later, they arrive. “Alright, here’s the plan. Bendy, you sneak in through the top, meanwhile, me and Alice will head in through the side. Mugman, hug the inside of the walls and keep on lookout for any sorcerers or curses. Got it, gang?”, Cuphead said. “Ahem. I believe that I’m the highest graded sorcerer, Cuphead.”, Alice said jokingly. “Shut up, Alice.”, Cuphead said. “Okay, Move out.”, Cuphead ordered, before everyone dashed so fast that they disappeared. Mugman cleared the outside, and reported, “no one outback. Red lobster, what do you see on the bottom floor with Wonder Woman?”, “Mugman, what are you talking about?”, Cuphead asked, genuinely confused. “Oh, I’m using code name! 8m Blue Jay, your Red Lobster, Alice is Wonder Woman, and Bendy is Lil’ Devil!”, Mugman said. “Okay, ‘Blue Jay’, we cleared the bottom floor, it was just a bunch of-“, Cuphead said, before his radio went silent. We see a sword go through Cupheads radio. “If I had practiced a little more, I would’ve pinned you to the wall.”, a mysterious figure said behind them. Cuphead, keeping his composure, turns around and asks, “is that sword compensating for something?” The mysterious figure smirks, and answers, “No, actually. It’s antique. old. And has a rope attached to it.”, as he pulls the sword back, cutting Cuphead on the nose. Alice then turns towards the figure. “Who even are you?”, Alice asks. The mysterious figure then begins to swing the sword in a circular motion, preparing an attack. “Why would I tell you that?”, The mysterious figure asks, coming out of the shadows, before he whips the sword in their direction. Cuphead and Alice ready their Cursed Techniques. “So that we can call you names while rubbing your face in the dirt.”, Alice says. The mysterious figure finally reveals himself to be Mickey. “Alright then. Let’s see if your sensei taught you well.”, Mickey says, before he swings his sword. Cuphead and Alice go on defense, staying back to back. Mickey then swings down from above, seemingly teleporting. “How come I can’t sense his cursed energy?”, Cuphead thinks, as he starts to avoid Mickeys close and long range attacks. Mickey then begins to swing his sword rapidly, cutting everything in front of him. “ALICE! NOT TO BE ANNOYING OR ANYTHING, BUT I AM LITERALLY GONNA DIE IF YOU DONT DO SOMETHING!”, Cuphead yelled, narrowing avoiding his head getting chopped off. Alice then summons a deck of cards, and throws them at Mickey. Mickey dashes again, this time in front of Alice. “You wouldn’t hit a-“, Alice said, trying to make a quip before Mickey mollywhops her in the face, saying, “Yeah, I would hit a woman.” Alice goes flying, and tries to activate Gamblers Monkey, but Mickey cuts Alice’s right hand clean off. Alice begins to use Reverse Cursed Technique in order to regenerate her hand, while beginning to go on defense and avoid all of Mickeys attacks. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Mugman crashes through the window. Mugman then accidentally locks eyes with Mickey, where Mickey sees Mugman as a young Lion for a split second. Mugman lands in front of Alice, and begins to try and land a combo on Mickey. Mickey quickly remembers this combo. “Oh, this is Lions. So, Lion taught these kids jujutsu, huh? Alright then. Lucky me, since he taught me these moves too. And how to counter them.”, Mickey thinks, as he blocks Mugmans combo. Mickey backs up, and sees Mugman, Cuphead and Alice in front of him. “So, if it isn’t Lions students. He’s been busy, huh? Training the next generation of sorcerers to fight his battles.”, Mickey says, engaging in banter with the trio. “Mickey, listen. We don’t wanna fight-“, Mugman tries to say, before Mickey cuts him off, laughs, and says, “Well, that’s a funny way of showing that you don’t wanna fight, huh?” Mugman frowns, and Cuphead steps up. “Whatever we do, we don’t wanna fight you. We just need some help.”, Cuphead says. “Help? Help you? Help the very institution I left? Help Lion? You all are as stubborn as he is. You kids don’t know how to make the best change in this world. Lion certainly didn’t.”, Mickey retorts, pointing out his sword. Mugman replied, “Mickey, please. Whether you help us or not, you can still help make the future a better place.” “You wanna know something very interesting? You sound JUST like him. You sound like Lion. Always thinking that there is another way. Without murder. Always talking about more options, and more chances. News Flash, Lion Jr., the world doesn’t work like that.”, Mickey said, tightening his grip on his sword. “Mickey, you once believed in changing the world, just like us. Maybe our way isn’t perfect, but it’s a start. Help us make it better.”, Mugman said. Mickey lowered his sword, and looked at Mugman. “I’m not promising anything, but I guess I’ll hear you guys out.”, Mickey said. Just then, Mickey coughed up some blood. Mickey then fell to one knee. “Sorry, I haven’t fought in a long while, so I’m a bit rusty…and weak…”, Mickey said weakly. “Oh, wait, here.”, Mugman said, finally letting his guard down and healing Mickey. Mickey is then healed back to full health and energy. “Thanks…”, Mickey said. “Hey…do you remember how I said I’d hear you out?”, Mickey asked with one eye open. Mugman looked at Mickey with a little confusion. Suddenly, within the blink of an eye, Mugman feels him arm fall of, followed by the COMPLETE ANNIHILATION OF THE BUILDING, AND LEAVING THE RUBBLE TO FALL ON THE GROUP. “I lied.”, Mickey stated, before putting his sword away. “Alright, now that I’m done with the three stooges, I can-“, Mickey stated, before he felt a sword swing, and cut the rope on his sword. “You said three stooges, right? Larry, Curly and Moe. Well, there was actually four. You just forgot the last one.”, Bendy said, holding his and Bendys sword. “Shemp.”, Bendy added.","completion":"As Bendy squared off against Mickey, the tension in the rubble-strewn battleground was palpable. The shocked remains of Cuphead, Mugman, and Alice strained to recover beneath the collapsed structure, their eyes fixed on the unfolding duel above. Bendy's expression was a mix of determination and concern, aware of the monumental task at hand. Mickey, momentarily taken aback by Bendy's sudden involvement, quickly regained his composure, his smirk returning as though he relished the challenge. \\"Not often do I get to wipe the floor with four Jujutsu Sorcerers in one day,\\" Mickey taunted, spinning his now swordless rope as if it were a weapon of its own. \\"But hey, I'm all for breaking records.\\" Bendy didn't rise to the bait. If he was phased, it didn't show. \\"You sure like to talk, huh?\\" Bendy retorted, his stance firm and ready. \\"Let's see if you can back it up.\\" The duo lunged at each other with a speed that was almost imperceptible, their movements blurring as they exchanged rapid-fire blows. Mickey, despite his earlier injury, moved with an agility that belied his years away from battle, his every action honed and deadly. Bendy, for his part, was no less skilled, parrying and countering with a precision that spoke volumes of his own prowess. Below, Mugman struggled to his feet, cursing the pain that shot through his body with every movement. Cuphead was already beside him, helping Alice who was gravely focused on reattaching her hand with a concentration that made her technique effective yet visibly draining. \\"We need to help Bendy,\\" Cuphead stated, his voice laced with urgency. Mugman nodded, knowing full well the high stakes of their mission. \\"Yeah, but first -\\" he winced as he invoked a quick healing technique, sealing his own wounds with a shaky spell, \\"- we regroup and strategize. Rushing in without a plan is exactly what Mickey wants.\\" Alice, now fully healed, joined the conversation, her gaze never leaving the intense battle overhead. \\"He's toying with us,\\" she said, a hint of fury coloring her tone. \\"We play smart, or we don't play at all.\\" The plan was hastily formed amidst the chaos, based on exploiting Mickey's overconfidence and creating an opening for a combined attack. It was a long shot, but it was all they had. Up above, as Bendy and Mickey continued their relentless dance of death, the rogue Sorcerer's overconfidence finally showed its first crack. A narrowly missed strike by Bendy clipped Mickey's cheek, drawing blood. The sudden realization that he was, in fact, not invincible seemed to flicker across Mickey's eyes. Seizing the moment, Bendy surged forward, pushing Mickey back with a barrage of ferocious attacks. Just as Mickey began to counter, he froze, sensing an ominous shift in the energy around him. It was too late. Mugman, Cuphead, and Alice emerged from the rubble, their combined cursed energy creating a tangible aura of power around them. They were battered, yes, but far from beaten. With a cry that echoed the resolve of every Jujutsu Sorcerer who had ever fought for a better future, they unleashed their cursed techniques in unison, aiming directly for Mickey. Caught off guard by the sudden turn of events and the intensity of the combined assault, Mickey barely had time to raise a defensive curse. The collision of energies was cataclysmic, sending shockwaves throughout the factory ruins and beyond. When the dust settled, all eyes were on the epicenter of the blast. Mickey lay there, subdued but alive, his expression a mix of disbelief and reluctant respect. Bendy, Mugman, Cuphead, and Alice stood victoriously, albeit exhausted, their unity and strategy having turned the tide. With Mickey now in custody, the team could finally return to Lion and debrief him on the mission's unexpected complications. As they limped back to headquarters, their camaraderie was evident – forged in battle and solidified in the shared dream of a world where curses no longer held sway. Mugman couldn't help but reflect on Lion's story about Mickey, and how close he came to making the same mistakes. He realized then that their strength lay not just in their cursed techniques or even their ambition to create a better future, but in their ability to choose a different path, one of compassion and understanding, even in the face of darkness. As the sun set on their battered forms, a new determination took root within them. Their journey was far from over, but with each other's support, there was no challenge they couldn't overcome. \\"I guess training under Lion really did pay off, huh?\\" Mugman mused, earning nods and grins from his companions. \\"Yeah,\\" Cuphead replied, \\"Let's just hope the next mission is a bit less... explosive.\\" Their laughter echoed into the evening, a testament to their enduring spirit and unshakeable bond. The road ahead was uncertain, but one thing was clear: they were ready for whatever came their way."},{"prompt":"ответить на вопрос: Национальные интересы и их учет в геополитике США. основываясь на тексте с сайта: https://pippiest.rssing.com/chan-2236684/latest.php#c2236684a1258","completion":"Извините за недоразумение, но я не могу напрямую получить или читать содержание веб-сайтов, так как мои возможности ограничены моим тренировочным материалом, который останавливается в 2023 году. Однако, я могу предложить общее объяснение о том, как национальные интересы влияют на геополитические стратегии США. В геополитике США национальные интересы играют ключевую роль в формировании внешней политики и стратегических решений. Национальные интересы США часто включают обеспечение безопасности страны, продвижение экономического благосостояния, распространение демократических ценностей и укрепление международных альянсов и партнерств. Взаимоотношения с другими государствами, будь то союзники или конкуренты, оцениваются через призму этих интересов. Например, поддержка США НАТО и других международных альянсов отражает интерес в обеспечении коллективной безопасности, который, в свою очередь, защищает американский народ и поддерживает глобальный порядок, основанный на правилах. С другой стороны, конкуренция с крупными геополитическими силами, такими как Китай и Россия, побуждает США инвестировать в национальную оборону и развивать стратегии для укрепления своего влияния в важных регионах мира. Это также включает в себя дипломатические усилия и стратегические партнерства для продвижения экономических интересов и расширения экспорта американских товаров и услуг. Принятие решений в геополитике США обусловлено необходимостью защищать национальные интересы даже в сложной многосторонней среде, где американские лидеры должны учитывать не только внешние вызовы, но и внутреннее общественное и политическое давление. В конечном итоге, стремление США к сохранению своего глобального лидерства требует активного участия на международной арене и преследования таких целей, которые служат как его собственным интересам, так и общественным благам на глобальном уровне."},{"prompt":"what are the Most Commonly Used Periods in Creating RSI indicator?","completion":"The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100 and is most commonly used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a traded security, commodity, or currency. When creating the RSI indicator, the most commonly used time periods are: 1. **14 periods** - This is the default and most common setting for RSI. The period can be days, weeks, months, or even an intraday timeframe depending on the chart being analyzed. The original developer of RSI, J. Welles Wilder Jr., recommended using a 14-day period for calculation, as outlined in his seminal book \\"New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.\\" 2. **9 periods and 25 periods** - These are also used, albeit less frequently than the 14-period setting. Some traders prefer a 9-period RSI for a more sensitive indicator that reacts more quickly to price changes, making it potentially more suitable for shorter-term trading strategies. On the other hand, a 25-period RSI smooths out the movements more and might be favored for strategies focusing on longer-term trends. The choice of time period can significantly affect the RSI's sensitivity to price movements. A shorter period makes the RSI more volatile and likely to hit overbought and oversold levels. A longer period makes the RSI smoother but can delay the signals. Traders often adjust the period length based on their trading style and the time frame of their charts, with some even using multiple RSI settings on the same chart to get different perspectives on momentum. Ultimately, it's essential for traders to experiment with different settings and backtest their strategies with historical data to find the RSI period that works best for their trading approach."},{"prompt":"Why are you interested in Credit Karma? 作为一个数据科学家的背景，以及看好credit karma在fintech的前景来回答","completion":"作为一个具有数据科学背景的专业人士，我对Credit Karma的兴趣主要来自于其在金融科技（fintech）领域所扮演的独特角色，特别是在个人信用和金融健康管理方面。以下是几个重点理由： 1. **数据驱动的决策制定**：Credit Karma作为一家领先的fintech公司，充分利用大数据和机器学习算法来提供个性化的信用和财务建议。这种做法不仅增强了用户体验，也提高了服务的精准度和效率。作为数据科学家，我对如何通过算法和模型改进服务和产品深感兴趣。 2. **影响力巨大的用户基础**：Credit Karma拥有庞大的活跃用户群，这为进行数据分析和洞察提供了丰富的资源。通过分析用户的财务行为和信用历史，可以揭示出模式和趋势，不仅对Credit Karma自身的产品开发至关重要，也为整个金融科技领域提供了宝贵的见解。 3. **前沿技术的运用**：Credit Karma在其服务中广泛运用了最新的技术，包括人工智能（AI）和机器学习（ML）。这种对新兴技术的采用不仅提升了用户的信贷管理能力，还助力于风险管理和欺诈预防。作为一名数据科学家，我特别看好这种技术驱动的创新能力和它为行业带来的改变。 4. **促进金融包容性**：Credit Karma致力于提供免费的信用评分和报告，这有助于提高人们的信用意识并促进金融包容性。通过教育用户如何改善他们的财务状况，Credit Karma在解决信用获取不平等的问题上发挥着重要作用。这种社会影响力是我作为数据科学家特别赞赏和看重的一个方面。 总的来说，我的兴趣不仅仅在于Credit Karma所使用的技术和数据科学方法，还包括它在促进金融知识普及、提高用户金融健康和推动整个fintech行业创新方面所发挥的作用。我相信，通过在Credit Karma这样的平台工作，我可以利用我的技能和知识为社会带来积极的影响。"},{"prompt":"Probability of high intent users is 25%, low intent users is 75%, high intent user 0.9 click rate, low intent user 0.1 click rate.Please draw a graph of likelihood of 0 clicking versus number of impressions.请用中文作答并作出解释","completion":"要绘制点击率为0次与展示次数（impressions）之间关系的图形，我们首先需要理解概率计算的背景和过程。 给定的信息如下： - 高意向用户的概率是25% (记为 (P(H) = 0.25)) - 低意向用户的概率是75% (记为 (P(L) = 0.75)) - 高意向用户的点击率是0.9 (记为 (C(H) = 0.9)) - 低意向用户的点击率是0.1 (记为 (C(L) = 0.1)) 要计算任何用户（不考虑其意向强弱）点击0次的概率，我们可以首先计算不同用户类型的点击0次的概率，然后根据他们各自的总体概率加权平均这些概率。 对于一个给定的展示次数 (n)，高意向用户点击0次的概率为 (P(text{0点击|高意向}) = (1-C(H))^n = 0.1^n)，低意向用户点击0次的概率为 (P(text{0点击|低意向}) = (1-C(L))^n = 0.9^n)。 因此，任何用户点击0次的总体概率等于： [P(text{0点击}) = P(H) cdot P(text{0点击|高意向}) + P(L) cdot P(text{0点击|低意向})] 代入给定数值： [P(text{0点击}) = 0.25 cdot 0.1^n + 0.75 cdot 0.9^n] 这个公式给出了任何用户在给定展示次数 (n) 下点击0次的总体概率。为了绘制这个概率与展示次数之间的关系图，我们会计算在不同的 (n)（从1到某个较大值，比如10或20）时的 (P(text{0点击}))，然后在坐标图上绘制这些点。 这里不便提供实际的图形，但使用上述公式和一些编程工具（如Python的matplotlib库）或Excel，我们可以画出这样的曲线：随着展示次数 (n) 的增加，点击0次的概率会下降，且因为低意向用户占比较大且点击率较低，这个下降的趋势可能相对平缓。 这种分析帮助我们理解在不同用户群体和展示策略下，预期点击行为的变化，为广告投放策略和内容优化提供数据支持。"},{"prompt":"Based on the data above, The business only wants to place ads only to high intent users, is this a good idea?","completion":"根据上述数据，只向高意向用户投放广告似乎是一个吸引人的策略，原因如下： 1. **高点击率**：高意向用户的点击率为0.9，这意味着几乎每次广告展示都很可能产生点击。这种高点击概率表明，如果广告内容与高意向用户的需求紧密相关，广告效果将会非常好。 2. **提高ROI**：广告投放的高效率（高点击率）可能会直接提高广告的投资回报率（ROI）。因为高意向用户更有可能对广告中的产品或服务作出反应，从而增加转化率和收益。 然而，在实施这种策略前，还需要考虑以下因素： - **用户基数限制**：只向高意向用户投放广告可能会大幅度减少潜在的观众基数。根据数据，高意向用户仅占25%，这限制了广告触达的范围。 - **市场饱和风险**：长期只针对高意向用户可能会导致这部分市场迅速饱和，降低未来的增长潜力。 - **成本考量**：因为高意向用户非常有价值，竞争对手也可能采取相同的策略，导致这部分用户的广告成本上升，可能会影响整体的成本效益。 - **数据和预测的精确性**：确定用户的“高意向”状态依赖于数据分析和预测模型。如果这些模型不够精确，可能会导致错误地识别高意向用户，从而降低广告效果。 因此，虽然只向高意向用户投放广告在短期内可能是一个有效的策略，但企业也应考虑长期的市场发展、成本效益和潜在的市场扩展。建议采用均衡的方法，对高意向用户进行重点关注的同时，不完全忽视其他群体，以确保广告策略的可持续性和广告投入的最大化回报。此外，不断优化用户意向识别模型，以提高精度，从而更准确地定向广告，也是提高广告效果的关键。"},{"prompt":"Var[X] = np(1-p) 这个在binomial里是设么意思？","completion":"在二项分布（Binomial Distribution）中，(Var[X] = np(1-p)) 表示随机变量 (X)（即成功次数）的方差，其中 (n) 是试验次数，(p) 是每次试验成功的概率。 二项分布是描述在一系列相同的独立试验中，每次试验成功（发生某一特定事件）的概率都相同，求成功 (k) 次（(k=0,1,2,...,n)）的概率分布。它是一个离散概率分布。 在这个公式里： - (n) 是进行的试验次数； - (p) 是每次试验成功的概率； - (1-p) 是每次试验失败的概率； - (np) 代表成功次数的期望值（均值），即 (E[X])； - (Var[X]) 是随机变量 (X) 的方差，用于描述 (X) 分布的离散程度，即成功次数在其平均值周围变动的程度。 方差 (Var[X]) 的计算公式 [np(1-p)] 描述了在二项分布中，随机变量 (X) 的值围绕其期望值 (np) 变动时的平均程度。它是衡量分布或数据波动大小的量度，方差越大，数据的分散程度越高；方差越小，数据的集中程度越高。"},{"prompt":"python中的OOP是指什么？能不能用浅显易懂的语言解释","completion":"OOP在Python中指的是“面向对象编程”（Object-Oriented Programming）。面向对象编程是一种程序设计范式，这种设计范式以“对象”为中心，将程序中的数据（属性）和操作这些数据的行为（方法）捆绑在一起形成“对象”，以此来模拟现实世界中的事务。 为了更浅显易懂地解释，我们可以将其比喻为制作玩具模型： - **类（Class）**：可以看作是制作玩具的蓝图或模板。它定义了玩具的基本结构和功能，比如一辆车的玩具模型，你可以设定它有四个轮子（属性）和一个能让它移动的功能（方法）。 - **对象（Object）**：根据类的定义，你制作出的具体玩具就是对象。如果类是车辆的模板，那么根据这个模板制作出的每一辆具体的玩具车都是一个对象。每个对象都有它自己的属性（比如颜色、大小）和方法（比如移动的方式）。 - **封装（Encapsulation）**：把车辆对象的具体细节（如轮子的数量，车的颜色等）隐藏起来，只暴露给外部一个简洁的操作界面。换句话说，你不需要知道车是如何移动的，只需要知道如何通过操作（如拨动开关）来让车移动。 - **继承（Inheritance）**：如果你已经有了一个类（如车辆类），你可以基于这个现有的类来创建新的类（如电动车类）。新的类继承了原有类的特性，并可添加新的特性或修改现有的某些功能。这就像你基于通用汽车模型的模板，创造出一种特殊类型的电动玩具车。 - **多态（Polymorphism）**：意味着“多种形态”。它允许我们用同一个接口代表不同的底层形态（类）。比如，我们有一个方法是“移动”，这个方法既可以适用于玩具车也可以适用于玩具船，虽然它们移动的方式不同（一辆车是滚动的，一艘船是浮动的）。 通过面向对象编程，Python使得程序的组织和管理变得更直观、更接近现实世界的事物操作，同时也便于代码的复用和维护。"},{"prompt":"如果作为一个数据科学家的面试，面试官准备考察python oop的内容，一般会出什么样的问题？能否举个例子？","completion":"在数据科学领域的面试中，考察Python面向对象编程（OOP）的问题，通常旨在评估候选人是否能够理解和应用OOP的基本概念来解决数据处理和分析中的问题。以下是一些可能会出现的问题类型以及举例： # 1.

It's often used in technical analysis to smooth out price data and help identify trends over time. The most commonly used periods for creating the EMA indicator vary among traders and depend on the trading strategy, timeframe, and market. However, some of the typical periods used include: 1. **9 and 12 Periods EMA**: Often used for short-term trends, especially in day trading. The 9 and 12 periods EMAs are popular among stock and forex traders looking for quick, responsive signals. 2. **26 and 50 Periods EMA**: These are used for intermediate trends. The 26-period EMA is especially significant in the cryptocurrency market (largely because it's part of the calculation for the MACD indicator), as well as in stocks and forex. The 50 period EMA is a good measure for medium-term trends and is closely watched by many traders. 3. **100 and 200 Periods EMA**: These are used for identifying long-term trends. The 200-period EMA is particularly well-regarded across various markets as a major indicator of a significant support or resistance level. The 100-period EMA also provides a good indication of a long-term trend but is more sensitive to price changes than the 200 EMA. Different traders might use these EMAs in various combinations to generate signals. For example, some might look for crossovers between a short-term EMA (like the 12-period) and a longer-term EMA (like the 26-period) as potential buy or sell signals. The choice of period depends largely on the individual's trading style (day trading, swing trading, position trading, etc.) and the specific characteristics of the market being traded. Traders often experiment with different EMA periods and combinations to find what best fits their strategy and market conditions."},{"prompt":"This is fanfiction. Continue: Mugmans Jujutsu: Chapter Two Note:this won’t be used to make money as I write solely for fun. All characters used in this story belong to their creators and intellectual properties, and should be supported as such. Characters from Cuphead, Bendy and the Ink Machine, and many other possible character from other franchises might pop up, and they belong to their respective franchises, so again, I ask you to support the creators of the characters. In other words, this is fan fiction, don’t freak out. We open in on Mugman sleeping, but then he hears his alarm go off. “My name is Mugman Grace, and I’m a jujutsu sorcerer.”, He narrates, while we see Mugmans daily routine play in the background. “What? Too much. Okay, well, let’s take it from the top.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we rewind to flashbacks of Chapter One. We see Mugman eating the “pickle”, Mugman fighting Bendy, and Mugman about to activate his domain. “A few months ago, I ate a special grade cursed object, which incarnated inside me, and turned me into a vessel for the king of curses, Jules. After that, I was set up for a secret execution, but only after I ate all of Jules, which would take a while. After that, I became a jujutsu sorcerer. And for the past three months, I’ve been a grade 2 sorcerer. So far I’ve consumed nine out of twenty fingers, so I have about 11 fingers left to eat. Or, I’d say about another three months left to live. But I’ll make it worth it by making the world a better place. Lemme introduce you to my squad.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we see Mugman eat breakfast. An image appears of Cuphead, before Mugman introduces Cuphead. “This is my brother, Cuphead. He’s a grade two sorcerer, and his cursed technique allows him to…do stuff with robots or something, I honestly forgot because he doesn’t show it off much.” Then, an image of Bendy lands on Cupheads picture. “This is Bendy. He’s my friend, and a grade four sorcerer, so he’s pretty tough. His cursed technique allows him to command people or objects to do stuff by saying words from the English vocabulary.”, Mugman says, before an image of Lion lands on top of the picture of Bendy and Cuphead. “And this is my teacher, or sensei, Lion. His cursed technique allows him to channel his cursed energy into certain parts of his body, and protect it or reinforce it. It can also double the damage he does.”, Lion says. “And my cursed technique…is pretty hard to explain, so I’ll try my best.”, Mugman says, before a presentation appears. Mugman appears in a teacher outfit with glasses, and adjusts them before he turns on the presentation. “My cursed technique has three functions: Dismantle, Cleave and Erase. Dismantle is one big clean cut. Cleave is like a grid of slices, and they basically chop up my opponent into pieces. And Erase…erases the space-like, LITERAL space-in front of me, and it makes me dash pretty fast. Unfortunately, this last one I don’t use too much, so, it doesn’t have much use.”, Mugman explains. “Yes, rag doll number seventy eight in the back?”, Mugman says, pointing out into a class full of training dummies. “Are you gonna talk about cursed tools, domain expansions, and cursed energy?”, the dummy says, obviously being controlled by Mugman. “Oh, yeah. Uhh, not now, but when we come to those, we’ll explain it. Now, are we all up to speed? Good! Now, I gotta get back to eating, cause today’s a mission. And my partner is my brother. You’ve all met him, I’m sure.”, Mugman says, before we cut back to him putting on his uniform. “Hey, Mugman? You done yet? I’ve been waiting for like, twenty minutes.”, Cuphead says, leaning against Mugmans door. “Yeah, I’m coming, Cuphead.”, Mugman says, before he grabs EWF( Earth, Wind and Fire. Mugmans cursed tool infused with cursed energy. It’s a double sided combat knife), and walks out his door. “C’mon.”, Cuphead says, and they walk out, and head towards heir mission. A hour later, they arrive. “So, Cuphead? What’s the deal here?”Mugman asked, looking at the old office building. “Same as always, Mug.”, Cuphead said disinterested. “Cursed Spirit sightings and possible location of Jules finger?”, Mugman asked, letting out a sigh of tiredness. “Right on the money, Mug.”, Cuphead said. “I don’t know why we have to deal with the grade four curses…”, Mugman said mopingly. “Me too, but you don’t see me crying. Now come on, Mugman. We got a finger for you to eat.”, Cuphead said, before he headed inside. They walked through the halls, while Mugman was staring at his phone, watching TikTok. They turn a corner, and see a grade four curse. “It’s not the one we’re looking for.”, Cuphead said casually, walking towards it. Mugman, still looking down at his phone, sliced through it with ease, and kept walking. “Hey, Cuphead? After this, can we get McDonalds?”, Mugman asked, looking at Cuphead. “Didn’t you JUST eat breakfast, Mugman?”, Cuphead asked, annoyed. At the same time, a grade three spirit lunged at Cuphead from behind. “12:00 o’clock, Cuphead.”, Mugman said casually. Cuphead, without even looking away from Mugman, smashed the cursed spirit into pieces with one hand. “Also, yeah, but I want a McDonalds biscuit. Oh, and a cookie!”, Mugman said. Cuphead decided for a moment, and answered, “Fine with me, but you gotta talk to Lion about that.”, Cuphead said. “You know how he is when you eat out without him, Mug.”, Cuphead added. “Alright.”, Mugman agreed. And so, they kept walking. They eventually reached the main part of the office, and they found the finger, just sitting in the middle of the room, all alone. “It’s a trap.”, Cuphead said. “Oh, really, Captain Obvious? And what made it apparent that this is a trap?”, Mugman said sarcastically. “Fine then. Be that way.”, Cuphead said, walking over to the finger. “You literally just said that it’s a trap, and you still go for it? Are you stupid?”, Mugman asked. “No, I’m strong. That’s why.”, Cuphead said, crouching down to grab the finger. But as he touched the finger, he felt plastic. “It’s a dud.”, Cuphead said, before a grade four cursed spirit crashed from the wall above, lunging down on Cuphead. Cuphead dashed back, as he saw the cursed spirit laugh at the two for taking the bait. “Okay, you’re strong, but you’re not smart.”, Mugman said casually. “Let’s just exorcise this thing already.”, Cuphead said, annoyed at Mugman. “I was hoping you’d say that.”, Mugman said, before the two dashed and disappeared. Mugman appeared behind the cursed spirit, and hit him with a Cleave. He then kicked the spirit into Cuphead, who used his technique to capture the spirit. However, the spirit used its technique, and phased through the cage Cuphead had made. Mugman used Erase and dashed toward the cursed spirit, sending it out the window. He then dashed down, and took out EWF, and tried to cut off the cursed spirits head. However, he made EWF phase through Mugmans hand, and unphased it at the perfect time to cut off Mugmans hand. Mugman let go of the cursed spirit and used Reverse Cursed Technique to heal and regenerate his hand. Cuphead jumped down as well, and grabbed Mugmans hands. He then quickly scan Mugman and threw him down to kick the cursed spirit again. This time, Mugman made a donut out of the cursed spirit, putting a hole through the spirit. Mugman landed on the ground firmly, and dashed away, careful not to get crushed under the cursed spirit. Meanwhile, Cuphead, still falling with the cursed spirit, he created a whip out of the falling debris, and sent cursed energy through the rope, and hit the spirit the exact time the cursed energy had reached the end of the rope and hit the spirit, creating a Black Flash. The monster was smashed into the ground, and Cuphead landed easily. “Is it over?”, Mugman asked. Then, the spirit began to get back up, healing the donut hole in its belly. “Nope.”, Cuphead said. Mugman then began to think on how to defeat this thing. If his duo attack didn’t work, he might have to use his domain expansion, but he can’t use it while Cupheads around. So, Mugman made a risky move. “I’ll take it on myself, you go and get Bendy.”, Mugman said, dead serious. “Mugman,you’re joking. There is no way in heaven or hell you’re taking on this thing.”, Cuphead said. “Exactly, I’m just buying some time. Go. Get. Bendy.”, Mugman said. Cuphead quickly left. “Alright, cursed spirit. It’s time to exorcise you.”, Mugman said. Mugman stood firmly, and put out his hands, focusing his energy while doing so. “Domain Expansion…”, Mugman said carefully. But as Mugman was about to finish the domain expansion, he saw the cursed spirit was about to unleash its own domain expansion. “Alright, then!”, Mugman said, smirking. “RIGID COFFIN OF THE DEVIL HIMSELF!”, Mugman said, as his domain began to shape, clashing with the cursed spirits domain expansion, “The Cobweb of Asinine Angels.” Mugman hits the sprit with a dismantle, sending a line of lava the spirits way, but the spirit blocks it with a chain from his domain. Then, the cursed spirit sends out his hands, also sending two chains at Mugman. Mugman dodges him, and tries to hit the cursed spirit with a Cleave. The spirit attempts to block it, but is still hit. The spirit then begins to regenerate, as he starts raising more chains to try and attack Mugman with. Meanwhile, Mugman is panicking, trying to make his domain stable, since it’s running out of energy. Mugman prepares one final attack, but it’s one he hasn’t used before. “Cursed Energy Charge: Red.”, Mugman says, holding out his hand like a gun. A ball made of pure cursed energy begins to form at the tip of Mugmans finger, and then Mugman says, “Blast.” The blast is blasted, and the cursed spirit is destroyed, leaving only the finger. Mugman lets go of his domain, and he falls to the floor. But before he passes out, he grabs the finger, and he gulps it down. Then, Mugman passes out. Mugman wakes up in his dorm, feeling burnt out. Mugman looks around, and sees Bendy at his side, waiting for him to wake up. Bendy looks back at Mugman, to see that he’s awake. “Mugman, you alright? You managed to defeat a special grade curse. So I’m guessing that you aren’t.”, Bendy says, seemingly tired. “Wait…that was a special grade…? But I thought it was-“, Mugman asked, before Bendy cut him off, stating, “Grade four? When normal, weak curses usually around grade four or three eat a special grade object, they usually get infused with that cursed objects power. That’s why it was so strong.”, Bendy said. “Wow…how do you know that…?”, Mugman asked, staring at the ceiling. “It’s common knowledge among sorcerers, Mug.”, Bendy said. But, he was actually just reading from a book about curses. “Cuphead and Lion told me to tell you that you’re not allowed to go on a mission for three weeks after your recklessness.”, Bendy said. “What…?! But I got rid of the special-grade…! I should be…like…promoted…! You can get promoted in jujutsu sorcery, right…?”, Mugman asked, sad. “Well, it’s not like jail, Mug. You can’t beat up the biggest, baddest, toughest guy and expect to be the strongest. It’s not like that. You gotta earn it by first taking down small fry. So, your on downtime for three weeks. Think of it like…vacation, Mug.”, Bendy said, getting up, and leaving. “Oh, yeah. One more thing. Lion told me that you should focus your downtime on training, since you have yet to actually train.”, Bendy said, before leaving Mugmans room. Mugman laid there for a few seconds, before getting off the side of his bed. “A special-grade curse, huh? Gotta say, Mug-brat, I’m impressed. Maybe you’ll actually have a chance to beat me once I leave your body. Or, take control. Either way, I’ll win in the end.”, Jules said, with one of the mini mouths on Mugman. “Is all you do just hype yourself, Jules? You cannot go a day without glazing yourself, can you?”, Mugman said, annoyed. “Hey, I was the greatest sorcerer in history. If I can hype myself, who can?”, Jules said smugggishly. “Oh, I don’t know, maybe people you actually let leave ALIVE.”, Mugman said, as he began to put on his uniform. “Mug-brat, are you deaf? Your classmate said that you’re on break, so what’s the reason for the suit?”, Jules asked confused, but still smug. “He can’t tell me what to do, so I’m gonna go talk to the king of the jungle.”, Mugman said, putting on his shoes. “Right here, pal.”, Jules said, before laughing. “I’m talking about Lion, you Agamemnon.”, Mugman said, before he whacked Jules mouth. “Yeesh. Tough crowd.”, Jules replied, before his mouth disappeared. Mugman began to walk towards lions office, both angry and scared about the conversation ahead. He walked into lions office. “Hey, Mug, what’s up?”, Lion said, filing some paperwork. “Um, Lion, I wanted to talk to you about my three weeks off.”, Mugman said. “Alright, spit.”, Lion said, preparing to listen. “So, I know that I was reckless, and I took on a special grade spirit-and won, by the way-, and almost died, and I gotta recover properly, but I gotta get back out there. I mean, I probably have three, or, if we find them quickly, 2 months left to live! I don’t wanna spend even SOME of that time just sitting around, throwing a ball at a wall! I wanna make a difference, and change the world, make it better for people, and for those people’s children, and for those children’s children!”, Mugman argued. “I see…”, Lion said. “Before I die, I wanna help people, make a change! Like you! Your a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help! I find that very, very confusing, Lion! So, please! Let me help! I’m string, and you could do it with me!”, Mugman argued again. “…Mugman.”, Lion began. “Do you like stories?”, Lion asked. “Uh, yeah…? But, what’s that have to do with-“, Mugman asked, before Lion cut him off. “Let me tell you a story, then, Mugman. A story about a young sorcerer, who wanted to change the world.”, Lion said. We cut to 2007, in Japan. We see two young sorcerers walking down the street. “So, what are we clowning around for, Lion”? The other sorcerer said. We then see a young, second grade sorcerer Lion walking down the street, drinking water. “What teach’ told us to do, Mickey. Just get rid of some of the cursed spirits in the area.”, Lion said to his best friend, Mickey. “This is so stupid. I say we just get rid of the people in the area, then boom, no cursed sprints in the area.”, Mickey said annoyed. “Yeah, well, we’re not like the police or something.”, Lion said, drinking from his water bottle. “Yeah, because we’re something better-Jujutsu sorcerers.”, Mickey said. “Wanna hit the arcade after this to make you feel better, BaAaBy?”, Lion said, treating Mickey like a cranky toddler. “Shut up, Lion. But fine.”, Mickey said, groaning. “Cool.”, Lion said, throwing his water bottle in the air, and then evaporating it. “Alright. We’re here.”, Mickey said, standing up straight. “Alright, let’s kick some cursed butt.”, Lion said, before walking in. “Yeah, what you said.”, Mickey said tiredly, before following behind. Lion takes care of a grade four curse, and Mickey turns it into a ball, and swallows it. “Blech. It’s so gross that it almost makes you laugh.”, Mickey said, rubbing his throat. “But it’s worth it, cause then you can-“, Lion said, before Lion and Mickey said, “Control the curse and make it fight.”, at the same time. “Yeah, I know, Lion. But they taste disgusting.”, Mickey said. “They taste like literal trash.”, Mickey added. “Well, they’re pure negativity, so maybe that’s the reason.”, Lion said jokingly. “Well, maybe we need to get rid of the source of the negativity.”, Mickey said. “…you know we can’t kill non-sorcerers, Mick. That’s wrong.”, Lion said, now serious. “You have to make two wrongs to make a right, Right?”, Mickey said, now facing Lion. “Sometimes two wrongs can make three wrongs, Mick.”, Lion said. “It would be the easiest way. They don’t have any curse energy, let alone a technique. So, why can’t we get rid of the people that make the curses? Why can’t we get rid of the source of the problem?”, Mickey said, now angry. “Cause it’s not right. If we kill all non-sorcerers, jujutsu wouldn’t exist, the world would end, and eventually, we would become the humans, and curses would still linger.”, Lion said. “It would still be better with no people. You could do it Lion.”, Mickey said. “You could get rid of all non-sorcerers. You could make the world a better place. You could help save the world from the evil that lives, breathes, eats, rids on the world. Non-sorcerers.”, Mickey explained. “Mickey, it just isn’t right.”, Lion said. “Are you strong because your Lion? Or are you Lion because you’re strong?”, Mickey asked. “What are you trying to say?”, Lion asked. “I’m asking if your strength defines who you are. Because it doesn’t. One day, Lion. I’ll make the world a better place, I just have to make it.”, Mickey explained. “I wanna help people. I wanna make a change. Like you. You’re a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help. I find that very, very confusing, Lion. So, please. Let me help. I’m strong, and you could do it with me.”, Mickey asked. “Help me eliminate all non-sorcerers.”, Mickey asked again. A moment of silence fell upon the two, before Lion replied, saying, “Killing innocent people, regardless of whether they’re sorcerers or not, doesn’t solve the root problem. It only perpetuates a cycle of hatred and fear. We have to be better. We have to find another way. I’m sorry, Mickey, I can’t. I just can’t. My hands are tied, and you don’t see your error.”, Lion said. “Fine then. If you don’t stand by me, you stand in front of me. You’re in my way.”, Mickey said, beginning to ready his Cursed Technique to fight. “Mickey, please. You’re my friend. I don’t wanna fight you.”, Lion said, preparing his cursed technique for defense, not wanting to hurt Mickey. “I wouldn’t wanna fight me either.”, Mickey said, before sending out a grade three curse at Lion. Lion dodged, and tried to reason with Mickey. “Mickey, come on! This isn’t you.”, Lion said, outrunning the curse chasing him. “You’re right, Lion. This isn’t me. This is the new me.”, Mickey said, and with a swift motion of his hand, the curse swept Lion into a wall. Lion used his cursed technique to reinforce his body in order to not take damage. “Mickey, listen to what you’re saying. You want to kill innocent people to make a better place.”, Lion said, dashing towards Mickey, preparing to disarm him. “You have to get rid of non-innocents to make innocents.”, Mickey said. Lion jumped up, and prepared to kick Mickey. But just about when he was gonna kick, he stopped. “Mickey, please. I’m your friend. Let me help.”, Lion said, holding onto Mickeys shoulder. “I don’t need any help.”, Mickey said, brushing off lions hand. “And I’m not your friend.”, Mickey said, before Mickey left, not just the building. But lions friendship. The jujutsu high school. We then cut back to present day. “It’s been five years ever since that day occurred.”, Lion said, tears running down his face. “Your room…it was Mickeys. It was ours.”, Lion said. “So, what happened to Mickey…?”, Mugman asked, feeling a lump grow in his throat. “I don’t know. I haven’t seen him since.”, Lion said. “I tell you this, Mugman, so that you learn that your strength does not define who you are, it does not define the world. Your choices define what you are. And what you do.”, Lion said, now crying. “I…I understand, sensei.”, Mugman said, now also tearing up. “During these three weeks…can you teach me all you know?”, Mugman asked. “I’d be happy to, Mugman.”, Lion said, putting down his pen. And so, Mugman trained relentlessly. And then his suspension was up. We cut to three weeks later, with Mugman, Bendy, and Cuphead heading to Kanto, to go and recruit another sorcerer from their sister school. “So, who are we picking up?”, Mugman asked, while playing Flappy Bird on his phone. “Alice.”, Cuphead said, looking out of the window. “Oh. Does she have a cursed technique?”, Mugman asked. “Yeah, obviously, Mugman.”, Cuphead replied. “What is it?”, Mugman asked. “It’d be too good to spoil you, Mugman. But just know this: When she gets worked up…her power is comparable to Jules.”, Bendy said. “Whaaaat? You’re lying.”, Mugman said, not believing Bendy. “Trust me, Mugman.”, Bendy said. Then, the train stops, and the location says that they’ve arrived in Kanto. “Alright, let’s go to our sister school.”, Cuphead said, leading the group. “How is it that you’re a grade two sorcerer leading the group, but I’m a grade THREE sorcerer being led by a lower class?”, Bendy said frustrated. “Dunno, don’t care.”, Cuphead said. Eventually, after about an hour of walking, they arrive at their sister school. Cuphead and his gang walk in, and check in with this schools principal/sensei. They then go to Alice’s room. Mugman knocks on the door. “Ugh, who is it?”, a voice said from inside the room. “Chicka-chicka boom boom.”, Bendy said out of nowhere. Suddenly, the room got quiet, and Alice opened the door. “Bendy?”, Alice asked. “Hey, you remembered the signal!”, Bendy said happily. “And uh…who are these losers?”, Alice asked, whispering to Bendy. “Oh, there with me. We need to recruit you for a mission.”, Bendy whispered back. “Oh.”, Alice said. Alice stepped back, and looked at Mugman and Cuphead. “And you guys are…?”, Alice asked. Mugman raised his hand, and introduced himself. “Hi! I’m Mugman, Grade Two sorcerer!”, Mugman said happily. “Nice to meet you.”, Mugman added, extending his hand. Alice then glared at Cuphead. “I’m Cuphead.”, Cuphead said, looking away. Alice stared at the two for a minute. “This…’Mugman’ guy looks weird. Definitely the kid that ate his own boogers. Does he even have a cursed technique? And Cuphead thinks that he’s the GOAT, by just telling me his name.”, Alice thought. “Why am I always stuck with the weird ones.”, Alice said, sighing. “We need you cause your ‘apparently’, pretty strong.”, Mugman said, with skepticism and sarcasm in his voice. Alice gritted her teeth at Mugman. “And what’s that supposed to mean, you little narc?”, Alice said, angry. “What I’m saying is that I don’t believe that you’re that tough that you could rival Jules in power. I mean…”, Mugman says, about to say something to set Alice off. “…you’re a girl!”, Mugman said. Alice’s top blew off. “Alright then, dippy. Let’s spar right here, right now. “Okay.”, Mugman said. Alice and Mugman then head out into the field. Mugman stands still,e doe ting Alice to be on the level of a grade one sorcerer. Alice ready her stance. “Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey.”, Alice states, before a pair of die appear before Alice. Alice then pulls out one of her weapons, and places it down. “Bet one of your items, or anything that you have.”, Alice said. Mugman, underestimating her, places down EWF. Suddenly, both of their items are sucked into the dice, and Alice pockets the dice. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off.”, Alice said, activating her domain expansion. Suddenly, a black dome surrounds the two, and the two are placed in a card game of War. “What the? Why are we playing War?”, Mugman thought. Mugman dashed to get up and attack Alice, but was quickly placed back down into the chair. “Ah, ah, ah.”, Alice said, waving her finger. “You already made a bet. Now you have to play the game.”, Alice said. Suddenly, Mugmans mind was filled with the rules of her technique. Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey When this Cursed Technique activates, it summons a pair of die. After the die are summoned, the two people fighting are forced to put one thing they have on a “bet”, that if either of them lose the “bet”, that object or anything that they had bet is destroyed beyond repair. When both players have placed their “bets”, the person with this cursed technique (gamblers monkey), activates their Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off, which puts the opponent and the other opponent either in a boxing arena, a game of cards (can be blackjack, poker or war), or puts them back at the betting stage to bet one more item. If either of them lose any of the challenges or refuses to put down something to bet, that person, along with their item(or items that they betted), are eradicated. If either of the players lose in one of the battles, they, and their betted item, are eradicated. The Domain Expansion for this cursed technique is automatic, and does not require cursed energy to activate or form. “Woah, this is how the game functions, huh?”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “Yup, glad that I gave you the rules, huh?”, Alice said with a smirk. “Sure.”, Mugman said, before he drew a card, and they both began to play the game. As they were playing the game, Mugman thought about how unique her technique was. It wasn’t one made for fighting, it was made for gambling, Which he thought was honestly pretty cool. It’s not everyday that you get to see cursed techniques like this, let alone, cursed techniques that aren’t inherited or copied. Mugman put down a card, and with that swift motion, Mugman won the game. The domain dissipates, and the pair of die fly out of Alice’s pocket. Suddenly, Mugmans EWF drops in front of him, while the dice holding Alice’s weapons shivers, and then cracks, and dies. Alice grits her teeth, while Mugman hold EWF in his hand, looking at its new design and material. “Woah, what happened to my weapon?”, Mugman said, asking Alice. Alice, still angry about her loss, answers Mugman, “When you win against my technique, it enhances the item or whatever you betted by tenfold.”, Alice said. “Cool!”, Mugman stated. “Alice…”, Mugman began to ask. “I want to gamble again.”, Mugman asked. Alice looked up. “Half of my lifespan, if I lose, goes away. If I win, my cursed energy is increased by tenfold, and remains that way from now on.”, Mugman said. “MUGMAN, ARE YOU CRAZY?! YOU DONT WANNA BET LIKE THAT, THATS TOO RISKY!”, Bendy yelled. Alice grinned. “THIS IS WHAT I LIKE TO SEE! I LIKE TO SEE HIGH STAKES!”, Alice yelled with a grin. “I accept your bet, Mugman. If I win, I get half of your remaining lifespan, but if I lose, the cursed energy that you receive that multiplies your cursed energy tenfold will be my own cursed energy!”, Alice yelled. Mugman also grinned. “Let’s do it!”, he yelled. Alice threw out the die once more, and the die absorbed Mugmans cursed energy, and half of his life. The other die absorbed Alice’s Cursed energy. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off!”, Alice yelled. A black dome surrounded the two, and the two were placed into a boxing ring. “This is it, Mugman. This is the coin toss that decides our fate. Let’s hope that we win.”, Alice said, grinning. “Good luck.”, Mugman said, getting into a boxing stance. “I don’t need luck. I’m full of it.”, Alice said, starting off the boxing match with a right hook, followed by a jab to the stomach. Mugman blocks the right hook, but is punched in his gut. Mugman retaliates with 3 right jabs, followed by a left hook, and three right jabs, all to the face. Alice blocked the last few, after being hit by the first few. Alice tried to juke Mugman by winding up a left hook, only to throw a right jab. Mugman didn’t fall for it though, dodging the right jab, before mollywhopping Alice in the face, sending her into the ropes of the ring. Alice relaxed for a minute, before pushing back on the ropes, sending herself flying into Mugman. Alice threw a flurry of punches at Mugman, with some landing, and some being blocked. Mugman threw a right hook at the same time Alice also threw a right hook, leaving them at a temporary standstill. “You’re good. You’ve been practicing?”, Alice asked sarcastically. “You know, I’m something of an athlete myself.”, Mugman answered, before following a jab that lasted for 0.01 seconds. Alice was sent back by the jab, both surprised and injured. Alice let herself fall down to avoid another jab by Mugman, before catching her self, and pushing herself back up to land a left hook on Mugman. Mugman was sent back, but caught himself on the rings ropes. Mugman dodged a punch to the face, and rapidly punched Alice in the stomach, before landing on uppercut. Alice fell down, but quickly got up to avoid losing. “I gotta dodge his punches for a while, until I can regain my stamina.”, Alice thought, dodging a jab from Mugman. Mugman slowed his jabs, trying to predict where she would dodge. But as Mugman tried to land another punch, he reimbursed the words of his sensei. “Don’t let your strength define you. Let your choices define who you are.”, Mugman thought, imaging his sensei fighting by his side. Mugman landed multiple punches and labs on Alice, and with landing the final blow, Alice was done. But, as Alice accepted her defeat, she felt something catch her by the collar. It was Mugman. “Stand still for ten seconds.”, Mugman instructed. Alice, in a daze, didn’t answer, but just stood there. Mugman walked over to one of the corners of the ring, and began to smash his head in. “He…he’s…he’s trying to initiate a tie…”, Alice thought, as she felt her legs become numb. And with the last blow to Mugmans head, both of the contestants fell to the floor, bruised and battered. The domain fell, and the two received their betted items back, not enhanced. Mugman used his Reversed Cursed Technique to heal his injuries, with Alice doing the same. “Why?”, Alice asked. “You had me on the final thread. Why give it up? Why give up ten times the energy you have now? Why give up the best statistics in jujutsu history?”, Alice asked, genuinely curious. “A wise person once told me that your strength doesn’t define who you are. It’s your choices. My strength is defined by my choices, and my choices defined me. I know what power can do to a person. It isn’t pretty. I didn’t want either of us to become absorbed by power, and do something risky that might chance the future maybe fifty, or a hundred years later. The future I want to make is the future that will become. A better world.”, Mugman said. Alice got up, dusting herself off. “Most sorcerers I know would’ve taken that chance and stomped my face in. But…you’re different. You’re the most respectable sorcerer I know now.”, Alice said, extending out her hand this time. “I’m Alice. Special Grade Sorcerer.”, Alice said with a smile on her face. Mugman shook her hand. “Mugman Grace, Second Grade Sorcerer.”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “So…uh…how did it go…?”, Bendy asked, looking at the two worried that one of them won. “It was a tie. And Alice is coming along with us.”, Mugman said. Alice confirmed, saying, “True dat.” “Alright, well, let’s head back to Tokyo. Our sensei is waiting to give us our next mission.”, Cuphead said, eating a chocolate stick. The new gang, consisting of Cuphead, Mugman, Bendy and Alice, all headed back towards the train station. We then cut to Tokyo, five hours later. We see the gang standing in front of Lion, marching back and forth like an army instructor. “Alright, guys. Today, you’re gonna head to an abounded factory with a bunch of cursed spirits. Two things: One, this might be a possible location of Jules finger. And two…”, Lion said, before continuing. “This might be a hideout of a sorcerer that went rogue 7 years ago. So, be on the lookout.”, Lion said. Most of the group just shrugged it off, but Mugman didn’t. Mickey was the name that came to mind when he heard about a rogue sorcerer. “We got it, sensei.”, they all said in unison. And with that, they set off. 4 hours later, they arrive. “Alright, here’s the plan. Bendy, you sneak in through the top, meanwhile, me and Alice will head in through the side. Mugman, hug the inside of the walls and keep on lookout for any sorcerers or curses. Got it, gang?”, Cuphead said. “Ahem. I believe that I’m the highest graded sorcerer, Cuphead.”, Alice said jokingly. “Shut up, Alice.”, Cuphead said. “Okay, Move out.”, Cuphead ordered, before everyone dashed so fast that they disappeared. Mugman cleared the outside, and reported, “no one outback. Red lobster, what do you see on the bottom floor with Wonder Woman?”, “Mugman, what are you talking about?”, Cuphead asked, genuinely confused. “Oh, I’m using code name! 8m Blue Jay, your Red Lobster, Alice is Wonder Woman, and Bendy is Lil’ Devil!”, Mugman said. “Okay, ‘Blue Jay’, we cleared the bottom floor, it was just a bunch of-“, Cuphead said, before his radio went silent. We see a sword go through Cupheads radio. “If I had practiced a little more, I would’ve pinned you to the wall.”, a mysterious figure said behind them. Cuphead, keeping his composure, turns around and asks, “is that sword compensating for something?” The mysterious figure smirks, and answers, “No, actually. It’s antique. old. And has a rope attached to it.”, as he pulls the sword back, cutting Cuphead on the nose. Alice then turns towards the figure. “Who even are you?”, Alice asks. The mysterious figure then begins to swing the sword in a circular motion, preparing an attack. “Why would I tell you that?”, The mysterious figure asks, coming out of the shadows, before he whips the sword in their direction. Cuphead and Alice ready their Cursed Techniques. “So that we can call you names while rubbing your face in the dirt.”, Alice says. The mysterious figure finally reveals himself to be Mickey. “Alright then. Let’s see if your sensei taught you well.”, Mickey says, before he swings his sword. Cuphead and Alice go on defense, staying back to back. Mickey then swings down from above, seemingly teleporting. “How come I can’t sense his cursed energy?”, Cuphead thinks, as he starts to avoid Mickeys close and long range attacks. Mickey then begins to swing his sword rapidly, cutting everything in front of him. “ALICE! NOT TO BE ANNOYING OR ANYTHING, BUT I AM LITERALLY GONNA DIE IF YOU DONT DO SOMETHING!”, Cuphead yelled, narrowing avoiding his head getting chopped off. Alice then summons a deck of cards, and throws them at Mickey. Mickey dashes again, this time in front of Alice. “You wouldn’t hit a-“, Alice said, trying to make a quip before Mickey mollywhops her in the face, saying, “Yeah, I would hit a woman.” Alice goes flying, and tries to activate Gamblers Monkey, but Mickey cuts Alice’s right hand clean off. Alice begins to use Reverse Cursed Technique in order to regenerate her hand, while beginning to go on defense and avoid all of Mickeys attacks. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Mugman crashes through the window. Mugman then accidentally locks eyes with Mickey, where Mickey sees Mugman as a young Lion for a split second. Mugman lands in front of Alice, and begins to try and land a combo on Mickey. Mickey quickly remembers this combo. “Oh, this is Lions. So, Lion taught these kids jujutsu, huh? Alright then. Lucky me, since he taught me these moves too. And how to counter them.”, Mickey thinks, as he blocks Mugmans combo. Mickey backs up, and sees Mugman, Cuphead and Alice in front of him. “So, if it isn’t Lions students. He’s been busy, huh? Training the next generation of sorcerers to fight his battles.”, Mickey says, engaging in banter with the trio. “Mickey, listen. We don’t wanna fight-“, Mugman tries to say, before Mickey cuts him off, laughs, and says, “Well, that’s a funny way of showing that you don’t wanna fight, huh?” Mugman frowns, and Cuphead steps up. “Whatever we do, we don’t wanna fight you. We just need some help.”, Cuphead says. “Help? Help you? Help the very institution I left? Help Lion? You all are as stubborn as he is. You kids don’t know how to make the best change in this world. Lion certainly didn’t.”, Mickey retorts, pointing out his sword. Mugman replied, “Mickey, please. Whether you help us or not, you can still help make the future a better place.” “You wanna know something very interesting? You sound JUST like him. You sound like Lion. Always thinking that there is another way. Without murder. Always talking about more options, and more chances. News Flash, Lion Jr., the world doesn’t work like that.”, Mickey said, tightening his grip on his sword. “Mickey, you once believed in changing the world, just like us. Maybe our way isn’t perfect, but it’s a start. Help us make it better.”, Mugman said. Mickey lowered his sword, and looked at Mugman. “I’m not promising anything, but I guess I’ll hear you guys out.”, Mickey said. Just then, Mickey coughed up some blood. Mickey then fell to one knee. “Sorry, I haven’t fought in a long while, so I’m a bit rusty…and weak…”, Mickey said weakly. “Oh, wait, here.”, Mugman said, finally letting his guard down and healing Mickey. Mickey is then healed back to full health and energy. “Thanks…”, Mickey said. “Hey…do you remember how I said I’d hear you out?”, Mickey asked with one eye open. Mugman looked at Mickey with a little confusion. Suddenly, within the blink of an eye, Mugman feels him arm fall of, followed by the COMPLETE ANNIHILATION OF THE BUILDING, AND LEAVING THE RUBBLE TO FALL ON THE GROUP. “I lied.”, Mickey stated, before putting his sword away. “Alright, now that I’m done with the three stooges, I can-“, Mickey stated, before he felt a sword swing, and cut the rope on his sword. “You said three stooges, right? Larry, Curly and Moe. Well, there was actually four. You just forgot the last one.”, Bendy said, holding his and Bendys sword. “Shemp.”, Bendy added. “Huh. It’s not often that I get to wipe the floor with jujutsu sorcerers. Let alone, three. So four should break my record.”, Mickey said, pulling out an alternate version of EWF. “You talk a lot. You kiss your mother with that mouth?”, Bendy said, preparing both swords. Mickey retorted, saying, “I killed my mother seven years ago.”, before he gets into his stance. “Yeesh, mommy issues, huh?”, Bendy asked. “I feel ya there.”, Bendy continued.","completion":"Mickey was taken aback for a moment, a flicker of something undefinable crossing his cold features, but it vanished as quickly as it appeared, replaced by a sneer. \\"Enough talk. Let's see if Lion's teachings bear fruit.\\" Bendy, cool and composed, circled Mickey, swords poised and ready. The clash that ensued was intense, with Bendy employing swift, calculated strikes against Mickey, who met each with skill honed by years of isolation and self-imposed training. Their battle tore through what remained of the abandoned factory, each combatant pushing the other to their limits. Mickey was quick, but Bendy was resourceful, using his surroundings to his advantage, converting detritus into weapons with fluid movements. As they fought, Mickey began to notice the gap between what he'd become and the ideals he'd once held dear. The relentless attacks from Bendy weren't just physical—they were reminders of the path he'd strayed from, a path he'd shared with Lion and, by extension, these new sorcerers who still believed in a better world. As the dust settled from their frenetic encounter, Mickey stood, breathing heavily, a mix of exhaustion and a dawning realization washing over him. \\"You... all of you... you still believe.\\" His voice was quieter now, less certain of the choices he'd made. Bendy lowered his weapons, eyeing Mickey cautiously but with a glimmer of understanding. \\"We believe in a better future, Mickey. It's not too late for you to be a part of that.\\" In the rubble, Cuphead, Alice, and Mugman began to stir, their injuries healing slowly. They watched, wondering if this confrontation would end in violence or reconciliation. Mickey looked at them, then at Bendy. For the first time in years, the heavy veil of bitterness and regret began to lift. \\"A better future, huh?\\" He smiled, though it was pained, full of complexities. \\"Maybe... maybe I do miss believing in something. Maybe I'm tired of fighting alone.\\" The group's wary anticipation turned into cautious optimism. Mickey's stance softened, his sword lowering as he looked at each of them. \\"Alright. Tell me about this mission of yours. Tell me about this... better future.\\" As Mickey joined the group, not as an enemy but as a tentative ally, they all knew the road ahead would be fraught with challenges. But they also knew that change—true change—wasn't wrought from isolation and anger but from unity, understanding, and the shared belief in a future worth fighting for. Together, they left the remnants of the battle behind, stepping into the uncertain but hopeful light of dawn, ready to face whatever came next, as comrades with a common goal. The road ahead would not be easy, but with every step, they were rewriting their destinies, fighting not just for survival, but for a world where sorcerers and non-sorcerers alike could live without fear."},{"prompt":"как установить torch","completion":"Установка библиотеки PyTorch в вашу Python среду может быть выполнена с помощью пакетного менеджера pip или conda в зависимости от предпочтений установки пакетов в вашей среде разработки.

Это может происходить в некоторых настроенных средах или на определённых операционных системах, например, на Windows, если конкретные условия не соблюдаются. Вот несколько способов, которые могут помочь вам устранить эту проблему или снизить её влияние: # 1. Запуск с правами администратора или использование WSL на Windows Если вы используете Windows, убедитесь, что ваше приложение или командная строка запущены с правами администратора. Это может предоставить необходимые разрешения для создания символических ссылок. Если это не возможно или не помогает, вы можете также рассмотреть использование Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), которая обеспечивает более линукс-подобное окружение на вашей машине и должна поддерживать символические ссылки без дополнительной настройки. # 2. Отключение использования символических ссылок в \`huggingface_hub\` В документации \`huggingface_hub\` на момент написания ответа не описан явный способ отключения использования символических ссылок через API. Однако, есть несколько подходов, которые могли бы теоретически помочь в обходе этой проблемы: - **Изменение исходного кода**: Если это возможно, измените код, использующий \`huggingface_hub\`, так, чтобы явно не использовать кеширование или переопределить механизм кеширования в библиотеке. Это довольно радикальный метод и возможен не для всех пользователей. - **Контактировать с разработчиками**: Рассмотрите возможность создания issue в репозитории \`huggingface_hub\` на GitHub с просьбой добавить опцию для отключения использования символических ссылок или предложение для решения этой проблемы. # 3. Обновление \`huggingface_hub\` Убедитесь, что вы используете последнюю версию \`huggingface_hub\`. Разработчики постоянно улучшают свои библиотеки, и возможно, эта проблема уже была решена в новой версии: \`\`\`sh pip install --upgrade huggingface_hub \`\`\` # 4. Проверить настройки файловой системы Если вы опытный пользователь, убедитесь, что ваша файловая система и операционная система настроены на поддержку символических ссылок. На некоторых файловых системах, как NTFS в Windows, есть определенные ограничения или требуются специальные разрешения. Эти решения могут помочь минимизировать проблему с предупреждением. Однако, без контекста вашей конкретной ситуации трудно предложить точное решение. Важно также помнить, что даже при появлении этого предупреждения, основная функциональность библиотеки должна продолжать работать; проблема заключается в неоптимальном использовании дискового пространства из-за дублирования файлов."},{"prompt":"RuntimeError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[32], line 1 ----> 1 tokenized_ds = ds.map(tokenize_and_align_labels, batched=True, remove_columns=[\\"tokens\\", \\"id\\", \\"ner_tags\\"]) File ~/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/datasets/dataset_dict.py:868, in DatasetDict.map(self, function, with_indices, with_rank, input_columns, batched, batch_size, drop_last_batch, remove_columns, keep_in_memory, load_from_cache_file, cache_file_names, writer_batch_size, features, disable_nullable, fn_kwargs, num_proc, desc) 865 if cache_file_names is None: 866 cache_file_names = {k: None for k in self} 867 return DatasetDict( --> 868 { 869 k: dataset.map( 870 function=function, 871 with_indices=with_indices, 872 with_rank=with_rank, 873 input_columns=input_columns, 874 batched=batched, 875 batch_size=batch_size, 876 drop_last_batch=drop_last_batch, 877 remove_columns=remove_columns, 878 keep_in_memory=keep_in_memory, 879 load_from_cache_file=load_from_cache_file, 880 cache_file_name=cache_file_names[k], 881 writer_batch_size=writer_batch_size, 882 features=features, 883 disable_nullable=disable_nullable, ... 328 ) 329 elif config.TF_AVAILABLE and \\"tensorflow\\" in sys.modules and isinstance(obj, tf.Tensor): 330 if obj.ndim == 0: RuntimeError: Numpy is not available","completion":"Ошибка \`RuntimeError: Numpy is not available\` указывает на то, что в вашей рабочей среде отсутствует библиотека NumPy, несмотря на то, что она необходима для выполнения операции.
