Те самые длинные и самые весёлые каникулы в году, которые мы, дети 90-х и ранних 00-х, ждали с нетерпением.<br/><br/>Закончив украшать ёлку самодельными игрушками и мишурой, мы знали, что впереди целых две недели беззаботного счастья. Каникулы в нашем детстве были насыщены событиями: походы на горки в компании друзей, где мы мерялись длиной и скоростью спусков; бабочки в животе от полётов на санках и небольшие страхи перед самыми крутыми “горками”. <br/><br/>Неотъемлемой частью были игры в снежки, строительство снежных крепостей и создание всевозможных снежных скульптур от простого снеговика с морковным носом до целых фортов. Каждое утро начиналось с нетерпеливого взгляда в окно, в надежде, что ночью выпал свежий снег.<br/><br/>Каникулы были и временем творчества: мы рисовали зимние пейзажи, вырезали снежинки из бумаги, складывали кораблики и самолётики. Была своя особенная эстетика в мерцающих гирляндах, поделках из солёного теста и сверкающих на ёлке шарах, рядом с которыми неизменно стояли мандарины, аромат которых до сих пор напоминает о тех детских новогодних каникулах.<br/><br/>Мы с нетерпением ждали новогоднего утренника и встречу с Дедом Морозом и Снегурочкой, где каждый из нас получал свой момент славы, выходя на сцену для стихотворения или танца. А после праздника возвращались домой с небольшими подарками, которые казались нам чудом.<br/><br/>Новогодние каникулы в нашем детстве – это запах елки, ожившие сказки, шёпот хрустальных сосулек на крышах и блеск сверкающих звёзд в зимней ночи. То время, когда магия казалась совершенно реальной, а каждый день преподносил маленькие чудеса.<br/><br/>Такие воспоминания – настоящий кладезь ностальгии, наполненный счастливыми моментами, о которых с такой теплотой вспоминают взрослые, заглядывая сквозь призму прошлых лет. И хотя мир вокруг нас меняется, этот лоск детских впечатлений остаётся с нами навсегда. Пользователь: Алло Ты: Здравствуйте! Как я могу помочь вам сегодня?

Пользователь: Анализ главы \\"Тамань\\" Из романа герой нашего времени лермонтова Ты: Глава “Тамань” из романа Михаила Юрьевича Лермонтова “Герой нашего времени” – одна из пяти воспоминательных повестей, рассказывающая об одном из эпизодов жизни главного героя Печорина. Это повествование отличается от остальных глав своим мистическим и призрачным настроением и демонстрирует сложность и двуличность характера Печорина.<br/><br/>В “Тамани” Печорин описывает своё короткое пребывание в маленьком морском поселке Тамань, где он по пути в Грузию намеревался переправиться через море. Несмотря на кажущуюся прозаичность цели его поездки, Печорин сталкивается с рядом странных событий и фигур, которые придают этой главе атмосферу готического романа.<br/><br/>Так, здесь встречаются три загадочных персонажа: слепой мальчик, который читает сны и играет на гармони; девушка-контрабандист, испытывающая к Печорину двойственные чувства; загадочный рыбак, которого Печорин заподозрил в контрабанде. Ощущение таинственности усиливается ещё и тем, что все герои появляются в неожиданных ситуациях и обладают некоторыми странными чертами.<br/><br/>“Тамань” — это также рассказ о человеческом обмане и самообмане. Печорин, несмотря на свою проницательность и аналитический ум, оказывается в ловушке собственного заблуждения, веря в реальность увиденного “двойника” на море, который оказывается простым призрачным отражением лунного света.<br/><br/>Глава выделяется в романе также своим поэтическим языком и мрачным ландшафтом, становясь в некотором смысле отражением внутреннего мира Печорина, полного противоречий, тайн и не реализованных эмоций. Море, скалы, непогода создают фон, атмосферу подавленности и одиночества, который идеально подходит к размышлениям героя о себе и своём месте в мире.<br/><br/>Анализируя “Тамань”, стоит также упомянуть об основной теме всего романа — поиске Печорином смысла жизни и истины, его непримиримой натуре и бессильности перед обыденностью, которую он пытается разрушить, вступая в конфликт со всем вокруг и в первую очередь с самим собой.

Сердце этого уникального региона бьётся в ритме волн Балтийского моря, а его душа отражается в тысячах оттенков янтаря, подаренных природой.<br/><br/>Этот город, словно сундук сокровищ, полон истории и культурной жизни, но его главное богатство скрыто в янтаре.

Это удивительное народное гуляние, которое знаменует прощание с зимой и встречу весны. Масленица — это не только радость оттепели и предвкушение нового солнечного цикла, но и возможность погрузиться в вековые традиции, веселиться от души на ярмарках, играя в народные забавы и катаясь на санях.<br/><br/>На протяжении всей недели, принявшей имя этого прекрасного праздника, наши столы ломятся от самого вкусного и румяного символа Масленицы — блинов. Яркие, словно солнышко, они напоминают нам о тепле, которое скоро заполнит воздух, о лучах солнца, касающихся просыпающейся ото сна земли.<br/><br/>Этот праздник — ещё и время примирения. Мы просим прощения у своих близких и знакомых за все невольные обиды и начинаем год с чистого листа. Масленица приглашает каждого из нас вспомнить о важности добрых отношений и теплоте человеческого общения.<br/><br/>Поэтому сегодня не упустите возможность погрузиться в атмосферу радости и праздника.

Светлые воспоминания о цирке начинаются с момента, когда в руках оказывалась пестрая брошюра с анонсами предстоящих выступлений, и взрослые обещали скорый поход на удивительное представление.<br/><br/>В воздухе витал дух приключений и радости, когда мы, держась за руки родителей, ступали под ярко украшенный цирковой шатёр. Запах попкорна и сладкой ваты смешивался с ароматами лошадей и мощи слонов, образуя неповторимый коктейль ощущений, который запомнится на всю жизнь.<br/><br/>Свет огней над ареной привлекал взгляд, заставлял забыть обо всём на свете. А детский смех сливался с оживлёнными разговорами зрителей, которые с нетерпением ожидали начала представления. Клоуны с розовыми носами, акробаты, выполняющие невообразимые трюки на головокружительной высоте, и грациозные гимнасты создавали атмосферу, где реальность казалась чем-то недостижимым.<br/><br/>Каждый номер цирка напоминал небольшое чудо: дрессированные животные удивляли разум своим послушанием, а фокусники заставляли сомневаться в собственных глазах. А как же аплодисменты! Они гремели в ушах, создавая чувство причастности к чему-то великолепному.<br/><br/>Поход в цирк в нашем детстве был символом радости, восторга и неподдельного удивления. Эти моменты остаются навсегда в памяти, как напоминание о том, что мир полон тайн и магии, достаточно лишь взглянуть на него детскими глазами. Подаренные впечатления живут в сердце, вспыхивая тёплым светом в моменты ностальгии. Пользователь: Россия - страна возможностей!

Я люблю лето по множеству причин, и каждая из них делает это время года особенным и незаменимым. Во-первых, лето приносит с собой тепло и солнце, которые пробуждают после долгой зимы всё живое. С первыми летними днями природа вокруг оживает, наполняясь яркими красками и ароматами цветущих растений. Долгие дни и короткие ночи создают идеальные условия для приключений и открытий. Лето — это также время отдыха и разрешения от обычного графика учёбы или работы. Школьные каникулы дают свободу для игр на свежем воздухе, поездок к морю, пикников с друзьями и семьёй. Можно забыть о будильнике и дать себе разгул в развлечениях и путешествиях. Я люблю лето за возможность заняться спортом на улице. Будь то катание на велосипеде, плавание в бассейне или море, футбол в парке — все эти активности приносят радость и помогают поддерживать здоровье и хорошее настроение. Нет ничего лучше, чем ощущение свежего ветра во время утренней пробежки или вдыхание аромата леса во время похода. Летом природа предоставляет массу даров, и я от души люблю ягоды и фрукты, которые созревают в это время. Клубника, малина, черешня — каждый плод наполнен солнечным светом и теплом, а их вкус и полезные свойства делают это время года незабываемым. Также я восхищаюсь летними грозами и теплыми летними дождями, которые освежают воздух и приносят особое настроение. Шум дождя и впечатляющие молнии напоминают о мощи и красоте природы. И, конечно же, лето — это идеальное время для чтения. С книгой в руках можно уединиться в парке под тенью деревьев или устроиться на пляже, погружаясь в другие миры и истории под шум волн. Лето наполняет меня энергией, вдохновляет на новые идеи и планы. Это время, когда можно смело экспериментировать, пробовать новое и наслаждаться каждым моментом. Я влюблен в каждый летний день, в его неповторимость и очарование. Именно поэтому я так люблю лето — яркую, живую и полную чудес пору."},{"prompt":"en tant que recruteur fait une synthse des softskills de ce candidat en te basant sur ces questions : SOFTSKILL : Candidate Maxime KHIMA très bon orateur, idée placé correctement Gestion du stress : Décrivez une situation de travail stressante que vous avez rencontrée récemment.

My name is Cameron McCaffrey, and I am writing to you from the Boca Raton Achievement Center (BRAC), where I volunteer at the front desk, assisting those who seek to better their lives through education and support. Firstly, allow me to extend my deepest admiration for your accomplishments in the entertainment industry, but more importantly, for your philanthropic endeavors. Your dedication to empowering students globally through education, and your passion for giving back to the community, has not gone unnoticed. It is this altruistic spirit of yours that emboldens me to reach out today. As someone who was diagnosed with Asperger’s at an early age, I’ve navigated a unique set of challenges. However, it was the BRAC and individuals like Jim and Marta Batmasian, as well as our executive director, Evelyn Falconer, who have provided me with the support network to build resilience and pursue my dreams. In October 2023, life threw its most formidable curveball at me with the loss of both my parents within nine days. While nothing could prepare me for such a painful chapter, it was through the support of the BRAC community that I found the courage to continue striving towards my personal and professional goals. This transformative power of community is what the BRAC embodies for all those who walk through its doors, and it is a testament to what can be achieved with combined efforts and shared resolve. I am reaching out to you, Mr. Pérez, with a heartfelt request. Your visit to the Boca Raton Achievement Center would not only provide boundless inspiration to our students but would also affirm the invaluable impact of mentorship and community engagement. By sharing your journey—how you rose from the vibrant streets of Miami to international acclaim, while never losing sight of giving back to those in need—you would ignite the hopes and dreams of every individual here. A message from you about the importance of education and perseverance would resonate with our peers in the most profound way.

Please know that your positive response would not only be a personal source of inspiration for me but would undeniably uplift all those who benefit from the services of the BRAC.

My name is Cameron McCaffrey, and I'm currently an assistant at the Boca Raton Achievement Center (BRAC), where I dedicate my time to help those seeking educational advancement and community support. It is with utmost respect that I acknowledge your sweeping success as a Grammy-winning artist and global ambassador of music. You have consistently used your platform to champion causes close to your heart, particularly in advancing educational opportunities for young people across the world. I, too, have encountered my fair share of challenges, having been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome when I was young. The support from BRAC, and the guidance of figures like Jim and Marta Batmasian, along with our executive director, Evelyn Falconer, has been fundamental in overcoming obstacles and aspiring to achieve my dreams. Last October, I experienced the profound loss of both my parents, a mere nine days apart. This tragedy tested my resolve, yet it was the solidarity of the BRAC that offered a glimmer of hope and the strength to persevere. The center symbolizes the transformative effect that a nurturing community can have on individuals during life's toughest moments. I am thus compelled to ask, with the sincerest of intentions, if you would consider visiting the Boca Raton Achievement Center. Your story, transcending the streets of Miami to achieve global stardom, all while maintaining a commitment to your roots and philanthropy, would immensely motivate our youth and community members. A talk from you regarding the power of education and relentless pursuit of goals would profoundly resonate with our attendees, and your visit could help highlight the crucial work BRAC does, fostering potential partnerships and development opportunities. Your influential voice has the capability to reveal the latent potential here and inspire the next wave of leaders, creators, and innovators. I recognize the pressure on your timetable and the limits of your availability, but journeying to BRAC would gift us an experience beyond measure.

If you have any questions or need information on a specific topic, feel free to let me know!"},{"prompt":"Can I tell you about an alternate history scenario I made?","completion":"Absolutely! I'd be interested to hear about your alternate history scenario. Please go ahead and tell me the details, and I'll do my best to engage with it or provide any relevant insights and feedback."},{"prompt":"In this alt-history scenario, the NSDAP never takes power in 1933 because of Adolf Hitler dying during the 1933 Beer Hall Putsch. In 1933, the monarchists take over. The Sturmabteilung is outlawed and the SS still exists, however, it's more or less the military police force of the Wehrmacht. The NSDAP is allowed to continue existing, however they have a pretty bad public opinion because of the SA.","completion":"Your scenario proposes a significant departure from real-world history that would undoubtedly lead to major global changes. Here's an analysis of the immediate consequences and potential developments in this alternate history where a monarchy is restored in Germany following Hitler's death in the Beer Hall Putsch of 1923: 1. **Absence of Hitler and Rise of Monarchism**: Without Hitler's charismatic leadership, the NSDAP might struggle to gain widespread support. A monarchist power takeover in 1933 would signal a completely different ideological direction for Germany. Supporters of the Weimar Republic, communists, and other political factions would likely react strongly to this change. 2. **Civil Strife and Factionalism**: With the SA outlawed and a shift in public opinion, one might expect a period of civil strife and conflict between different political factions. The NSDAP might fragment without its paramilitary wing, and other groups might vie for power or influence. 3. **International Relations**: The restoration of a monarchy and the sidelining of the NSDAP might lead to a very different international standing for Germany. Relations with other nations could be more stable if the monarchists pursue less aggressive foreign policies than the NSDAP did in our timeline. 4. **Military Changes**: With the SS as a military police force within the Wehrmacht and no widespread implementation of Hitler's expansionist ideologies, the German military might look very different. There would likely be a different approach to military buildup, and without the drive for Lebensraum, the events leading up to World War II might not occur at all, or not in the way we know them. 5. **World War II and Holocaust**: The events and policies leading to World War II and the Holocaust were heavily influenced by Hitler and his inner circle. In this alternate timeline, there might be no massive pan-European war in the late 1930s and early 1940s, or it could happen for entirely different reasons. The horrors of the Holocaust might be averted entirely, saving millions of lives. 6. **Global Power Dynamics**: The absence of World War II as we know it would lead to a very different balance of power. Perhaps the Soviet Union would grow more dominant in Europe, or the absence of wartime economic boosts might leave the United States less of a superpower. Colonial empires might persist longer, and the Cold War could play out in a completely different fashion. 7. **Technological and Social Changes**: World War II spurred numerous technological advancements. Without it, technology, economy, and social progress could lag behind what actually occurred, but they could also follow different paths of development. It should be noted that historical events are highly complex and interconnected, making alternate history a fascinating but speculative exercise. Change one event, and the ripple effects can reshape the entire course of the world in unpredictable ways. Your scenario prompts us to consider a variety of consequences and the potential for a very different 20th century and beyond."},{"prompt":"The Rhineland still gets annexed and the Free City of Danzig is peacefully captured. Stuff like conscription, an airforce etc etc etc is brought back by the Monarchists.","completion":"In the scenario you're presenting, it seems that even without the NSDAP, Germany would still pursue some policies that challenged the Versailles Treaty, which imposed restrictions on German rearmament and sovereignty after World War I. The annexation of the Rhineland and the capture of the Free City of Danzig indicate that the monarchist government would still be interested in revising the post-war order and recovering territories lost or demilitarized by the Versailles Treaty. Here's how this could unfold and influence global affairs: 1. **German Re-militarization**: The revival of conscription and the rebuilding of an air force suggest that the monarchists seek to restore German military strength. This could create tensions with France and the United Kingdom, who might be wary of a resurgent Germany, even without the NSDAP's aggressive ideology. 2. **Rhineland and Danzig**: The annexation of the Rhineland, if unopposed by France and the UK, would be a crucial step in Germany regaining strategic depth and de facto repudiating the Versailles Treaty. Capturing Danzig could potentially resolve long-standing disputes regarding access to the Baltic Sea and Polish Corridor, possibly with less international backlash if done peacefully and with some form of international agreement or plebiscite. 3. **European Response**: The League of Nations, being the principal international body responsible for upholding the peace, would likely condemn German actions if they were taken unilaterally and without consultation. However, if Germany could negotiate these territorial adjustments, it might avert the kind of isolation that the NSDAP-led Germany experienced in our timeline. 4. **Potential Alliances**: Without the extreme ideologies of the NSDAP, a monarchist Germany might foster different alliances, possibly even including closer ties with the UK or Italy, depending on the European political climate and mutual interests. 5. **Jewish Population**: Without the NSDAP, there would likely be no holocaust, although the fate of minority groups, including Jews, would highly depend on the specific ideologies and policies of the monarchists in power. Anti-Semitism was present in Europe before the NSDAP, but the state-sponsored genocide was uniquely tied to Hitler and his regime. 6. **A Different World War?**: While these actions could heighten tensions, they might not necessarily lead to a conflict on the scale of World War II. The catalyst for a new war, if one occurred, could be quite different, perhaps stemming from conflicts over colonies, competition with the Soviet Union, or clashes over the revised European borders. 7. **Soviet Union**: Without the existence of a strong NSDAP and potential Soviet-German conflict as seen in our timeline, the USSR might take a more assertive role in Eastern Europe or form different alliances and strategies in response to the monarchist German government. 8. **Economic and Social Policies**: The economic and social agenda of the monarchists would significantly shape Germany's internal development. The specifics of these policies could determine how stable and prosperous Germany would be, which in turn would impact its ability to project power and influence. If the monarchists pursued aggressive foreign policies similar to those of the NSDAP regarding territorial expansion, albeit through less violent means, the overall strategic situation in Europe could still be quite tense. The shift towards military rearmament and territorial expansion would have long-lasting impacts, potentially including a different path to another large-scale conflict, although its character and participants might be completely different from what we know as WWII. It's a complex and intriguing scenario with many possible outcomes."},{"prompt":"Austria begins rearmament with the help of Germany and the United Kingdom. The Spanish Civil War doesn't happen, however a French civil war happens from 1933 to 1936. The Western side of France is backed by the UK and Germany and are led by Charles De Gaulle, the Eastern side of France is backed by Fascist Italy and is led by Philippe Pétain and the Southern Side of France is supplied by the USSR and is led by a random French communist.","completion":"The alternate history scenario you've presented further complicates the European landscape with significant changes. Let's explore these new developments: 1. **Austria's Rearmament**: German support for Austrian rearmament suggests a close relationship between the two states, possibly aiming at Anschluss (the union between Austria and Germany) through less confrontational means than those the Nazis employed. The UK's involvement could indicate a strategic interest in bolstering central European states against communism or other perceived threats. This could lead to Austria playing a more assertive role in regional politics. 2. **The Absence of the Spanish Civil War**: The lack of a Spanish Civil War would mean that the various European powers would not have the opportunity to test military equipment and tactics that later influenced WWII engagements. Additionally, it would mean the survival of the pre-civil war political status in Spain, potentially leading Spain to take on a different role in Europe, possibly as a less militarized and more stable nation. 3. **French Civil War**: This event is a significant divergence from our timeline and would have profound consequences. The division of France into competing regions backed by different powers would lead to a fragmented nation and a complex international proxy conflict. The outcomes of such a civil war would be pivotal for the future of Europe. - **Western France with Charles De Gaulle**: If De Gaulle were leading the Western faction with support from the UK and a monarchist Germany, he might represent a continuity of French democratic institutions and a possibly more conservative or traditionalist segment of French politics. - **Eastern France with Philippe Pétain**: Pétain’s leadership with Italian Fascist support could indicate an authoritarian or fascist-leaning government. This scenario might resemble Vichy France in a sense but with a different power structure and territorial limitations. - **Southern France with Communist Backing**: A Southern communist faction suggests the possibility of a strong socialist or communist movement. If this faction received substantial Soviet aid, it would pose a significant ideological threat to both Western capitalist democracies and any neighboring fascist states. 4. **European Power Dynamics**: These developments would likely be very disruptive to the European balance of power. The German-UK alliance might work to contain both fascism on one side and communism on the other, potentially creating a very different Western bloc alignment. 5. **Outcome of the French Civil War**: The victor of this civil war would determine the nature of France's future government. If De Gaulle's faction prevailed with UK and German help, France might emerge as a closer ally to the UK and a more stable, conservative regime in opposition to the Soviet Union and fascist Italy. If Pétain's faction won, France could tilt towards authoritarianism and fascism. A communist victory would drastically shift the geopolitical balance and could potentially lead to a Franco-Soviet alliance, dramatically altering Cold War dynamics. 6. **Long-Term Impacts**: The long-term global impacts of these changes would be profound. Without a stable, unified France, the concept of the \\"Western World\\" as understood in our timeline might be significantly altered. One could expect variations in artistic, cultural, and intellectual developments tied to France’s fate. 7. **Revised European Alliances**: The alliances you’ve described diverge considerably from the historical Axis and Allied powers. The UK and Germany’s cooperation against both communist and fascist factions in France implies a very different alignment than the one that emerged in the late 1930s in our timeline. This fascinating scenario opens up a myriad of potential outcomes. The ideological orientation of the key actors, the stability (or lack thereof) of regional powers, and the impact on colonial empires would all contribute to a very different 20th century, both in Europe and worldwide. The consequences for global conflicts, ideological struggles, and the post-war world would be quite unpredictable, opening up a rich field of exploration for alternate history enthusiasts."},{"prompt":"Meanwhile in Asia, French Indochina becomes independent because of the civil war, the Chinese Civil War is halted by a stalemate before restarting in 1943 and the militarists in Japan don't get power and Hideki Tojo is assassinated by a Japanese nationalist.","completion":"The developments in Asia you've outlined could have far-reaching effects, altering the power structures and historical events in the region significantly: 1. **Independence of French Indochina**: French Indochina's independence amidst the French Civil War could lead to an early end to colonial rule in this area. The power vacuum and potential lack of colonial military support could result in internal conflicts as different groups vie for control, potentially leading to a situation like that in Southeast Asia post-WWII in our timeline. This could have implications for the spread of communism or other political ideologies in the region. 2. **Chinese Civil War Stalemate and Resumption**: A prolonged stalemate in the Chinese Civil War would allow both the Chinese Nationalists (Kuomintang) and the Communists to consolidate their forces, possibly leading to a very different phase of the conflict when it resumes in 1943. The outcome of the restarted civil war may depend on which side receives more significant foreign assistance and how other regional dynamics play out. 3. **Shift in Japanese Politics**: The absence of militarist leadership due to the assassination of Hideki Tojo and the rise of a nationalist alternative could lead to a Japan that is less aggressive in its expansionist policies. This Japan might focus more on internal development or pursue a more diplomatic approach to regional disputes. Without the same level of militarism, Japan could avoid many of the conflicts that led to its eventual defeat in WWII. - **Impact on the Second Sino-Japanese War**: If militarists do not gain power in Japan, the Second Sino-Japanese War might not happen, or it could be significantly limited in scope. This would profoundly affect China's historical trajectory and potentially allow for a quicker resolution to the Chinese Civil War. - **Implications for the Pacific**: Without Japan's aggressive expansion, the Pacific theater of WWII as we know it may not occur. This could spare many nations in Southeast Asia and the Pacific from the brutal occupations and battles that took place. - **US-Japan Relations**: Relations between the United States and Japan could be notably different, with the potential for cooperation rather than conflict. Without events like the attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. might not become involved in a Pacific war. With French Indochina independent, the Chinese Civil War undergoing different phases, and Japan pivoting away from militarism, the geopolitical landscape of Asia would be dramatically altered. British and Dutch colonial interests, as well as the rise of independence movements across Asia, would be affected without the destabilizing effects of Japanese occupation. Colonial empires might retain control longer without the pressures of Japanese expansion and the opportunities it afforded to local resistance movements. Conversely, a less aggressive Japan might lead to a more balanced power structure in Asia, giving space for different diplomatic relationships to evolve between Asian nations and Western powers. The changes you suggest to both European and Asian historical events demonstrate how interconnected global events are and how a few divergences can lead to a drastically different world. The absence of World War II in the traditional sense, or its occurrence under different conditions, would have lasting impacts on international relations, economic development, technological advancement, decolonization, and the global ideological struggle between democracy, fascism, and communism."},{"prompt":"The USA isn't isolationist throughout the 1930s, but the UK is. In South America, Argentina has a short-lived fascist government for a few years before going to war with the US in 1940 and ending in 1941. The US declares war on Italy because of the war in Argentina.","completion":"This scenario represents significant divergences for both the USA and the UK, as well as an unusual turn of events in South America. Let's examine the implications of these changes: 1. **Non-Isolationist USA**: A United States that is engaged internationally throughout the 1930s suggests greater American involvement in world affairs before the traditional 1941 entry into World War II. This could involve a more assertive stance on economic and diplomatic issues, support for certain governments, opposition to others, and perhaps a faster recovery from the Great Depression due to increased trade and foreign investment. 2. **Isolationist UK**: A UK turning towards isolationism is a sharp contrast to historical reality, where it played a major role in international diplomacy during the 1930s. An isolationist Britain might be less involved in supporting allies in Europe and around the globe, which could lead to different outcomes in regional conflicts, potentially allowing for the expansion of totalitarian regimes in Europe and the unchecked influence of other powers. 3. **Fascist Argentina**: Argentina experiencing a fascist period and engaging in conflict with the US represents a unique twist. This would likely be rooted in Argentina's domestic politics but could also be influenced by broader ideological trends in the 1930s. A war between Argentina and the USA would be a significant event in the Western Hemisphere, likely drawing in other regional powers and possibly affecting the Pan-American Union and the Monroe Doctrine's influence. 4. **War between USA and Argentina (1940-1941)**: Such a conflict could be rooted in geopolitical disputes, trade tensions, or ideological differences. It might lead to changes in American military posture and strategy, as well as shift South American politics, reinforcing the US's role as a hemispheric leader. Depending on the nature of the conflict and its resolution, Argentina might face significant political and economic consequences. 5. **US Declaration of War on Italy**: The USA declaring war on Italy because of Argentine affairs implies a complex set of alliances and provocations. Italy's support for a fascist regime in Argentina could be the tipping point, but it would also suggest a broader alignment of fascist regimes in defiance of American interests. This declaration of war could draw the USA into European power conflicts earlier than in our timeline and could fundamentally alter the course of what in our history was the Second World War. These changes in government policies and international relationships suggest a different sequence of events leading up to or replacing World War II. The US, not being isolationist, could mean a very different response to the rise of authoritarian regimes, potentially forming alliances with like-minded countries seeking to contain fascism and communism. The repercussions for post-war world order, with the USA and the USSR possibly emerging still as superpowers, might be marked by American assertiveness and earlier involvement in global politics versus the Soviets. The United Kingdom's isolationism, on the other hand, might lead to its decline as a world power, and the early decolonization of its empire, as it focuses more on internal issues and less on its global reach. In South America, the Argentine-US war could catalyze shifts towards military governments or democratic reforms, depending on the outcome of the conflict. Moreover, with the US at war with Italy, the dynamics of the Mediterranean and North Africa would also evolve differently, possibly affecting the Spanish, French, and British positions in the area. It's important to note that this creates a complex web of interactions significantly affecting the course of the mid-20th century, with broad implications for economic systems, technological advancements (like the Manhattan Project and the space race), and cultural exchanges across the globe."},{"prompt":"Back in Europe, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact still happens, however it goes a bit differently. Germany, the UK, France (De Gaulle won and it became democratic), Finland and Austria will allow the USSR take a very small part of Poland that the USSR claims has a population of ethnic Belarussians and Ukrainians. If the USSR is to invade Poland, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Finland and Austria will declare war on the USSR.","completion":"In your alternative scenario, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact—historically a non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union—has different terms regarding Poland. It seems this version of the pact is more of a collective bargaining agreement involving multiple European powers, which is aimed at controlling Soviet expansion. The following considers the implications of these terms: 1. **Limited Soviet Expansion**: The pact allowing the USSR to take only a small part of Poland might be seen as an attempt to forestall a broader conflict while addressing some of the Soviet Union's security concerns. Nevertheless, it would put the USSR in a precarious position, given that any further advances would risk triggering a war with several major powers. 2. **Democratization and Alignment of France**: With General Charles De Gaulle at the helm of a victorious democratic France, France might become a leader in European security concerns and, in this scenario, appears to be closely aligned with Britain and Germany in terms of foreign policy. 3. **The UK, Germany, and France United Front**: A united front comprising these three powers creates a significant counterbalance to Soviet ambitions in Eastern Europe. Their collective security agreement involving Finland and Austria signals a departure from the appeasement policies of the UK and France prior to WWII in our timeline. 4. **Soviet Risk Calculation and Strategy**: Given the ultimatum presented by the collective European agreement, the Soviets would have to be very cautious in their foreign policy decisions regarding Poland and the Baltic states. A miscalculation might lead to war with multiple major powers, and thus the Soviets might either comply with the agreement or find ways to undermine it covertly. 5. **Impact on Poland**: Poland, even with only a small loss of territory, would feel surrounded and vulnerable. However, it might also feel somewhat reassured by the collective security promise from major European powers, especially given the historical lack of effective support from France and Britain in the face of the German and Soviet invasion in 1939. 6. **Potential for Conflict**: The strict conditionality placed upon the Soviet Union with regards to Polish territorial integrity is likely to be a source of tension. If the Soviets advanced further into Poland, the stipulations would ostensibly compel Germany, the UK, France, Finland, and Austria to declare war on the USSR. This could potentially lead to a version of World War II wherein the primary conflict is between the Soviet Union and a coalition of European democracies (including a monarchist Germany), rather than between the Axis and Allied powers. 7. **Finnish and Austrian Roles**: Finland's involvement is logical, given their interest in self-defense against the USSR, evidenced historically by the Winter War. Austria's role is interesting, suggesting a more assertive international stance and possibly an increased military capability afforded by the German support for their rearmament. This geopolitical realignment would make for a significantly different lead-up to any potential world conflict. The agreement effectively places a check on Soviet influence in Eastern Europe while suggesting a rather unified European approach to collective security beyond the real alliances that characterized the interwar period. Without a Nazi Germany and with strong political unity among major European powers, the ideological and military challenges of the mid-20th century might pit European democracies and a monarchist Germany against an expansionist Soviet Union. The absence of Hitler's genocidal policies could mean less emphasis on racial ideology and more focus on national security and political ideology in the shaping of alliances and conflicts."},{"prompt":"In 1941, Italy loses its Fascist government because of a revolution. The revolution was performed by the Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale (National Liberation Committee), backed by the USA and secretly by the USSR. After that, The only ruling party of the CLN was the Italian Communist Party. The rest were either purged or exiled. The Allied powers declared war on Italy in 1942, 3 years after the USSR invaded Poland in 1939.","completion":"This alternate scenario introduces a set of occurrences that could significantly recast the alliances and conflicts in the European theater: 1. **Revolution in Italy**: A revolution that overthrows the Fascist regime in Italy and leads to the domination of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) would fundamentally change Italy's foreign and domestic policies. Historically, the PCI was one of the largest communist parties in the Western world, but it never held sole power in Italy. 2. **US and USSR Support**: The USA and the USSR clandestinely supporting the same side in an Italian revolution suggests an unusual convergence of interests. It might indicate a shared desire to remove fascism from power, but it would create a complex situation once the communists become the sole ruling party. 3. **Shift to Communist Rule**: If post-revolutionary Italy becomes a one-party communist state, it would result in a sharp turn to the left and might align Italy closer to the Soviet Union. However, direct support for a communist takeover could be domestically contentious for the US, given the strong anti-communist sentiment in American politics. 4. **Allied Declaration of War**: It's interesting that the Allied powers (presumably including France, the UK, Germany, and potentially others) would declare war on communist Italy while simultaneously being at war with the Soviet Union following its invasion of Poland. This suggests a broad anti-communist bent to the alliance and potentially portrays the Soviets as the primary antagonists in this timeline's main conflict. 5. **Consequences for World War**: The entrance of the USSR into Poland, combined with Italy's revolution and subsequent war, essentially splits the traditional WWII narrative into two main conflicts: first, a coalition of European democracies and a monarchist Germany fighting against the Soviet push into Eastern Europe; second, the same coalition plus the United States fighting against an Italian communist regime. 6. **Strategic and Ideological Realignment**: This scenario would create an ideological realignment where anti-fascist and anti-communist sentiments unite former adversaries. It would also drastically alter the strategic landscape of Europe. Italy turning communist may embolden other leftist movements across Europe, which could cause further internal conflicts within countries trying to resist such changes. 7. **Role of Other Nations**: Nations like Spain, with its own fascist government under Franco, could find themselves in an ambiguous position, possibly aligning with the Allied coalition, despite ideological differences, due to a mutual opposition to communist expansion. Small countries in Eastern Europe could become battleground states, as they historically did in WWII — but this time, perhaps resisting Soviet rather than German occupation. 8. **Global Cold War Dynamics**: The dynamics of the Cold War would be dramatically different in this timeline. With the US and USSR temporarily finding a shared interest in Italy, the post-war environment, should the Allies win, could result in a bifurcated Italy or another divided nation like Germany in our timeline, with spheres of influence clearly drawn. 9. **Impact on the USSR**: This version of World War II, with the USSR as a principal aggressor in Europe, could lead to different outcomes for the Soviet regime. A war fought on multiple fronts (against an Allied coalition and possibly internally in Italy) could strain Soviet resources and affect the longevity of the USSR. 10. **Delayed Western Front**: In this scenario, there's no mention of a Japanese expansion or Pacific conflict, so it's possible the US focuses its military efforts on the European theater earlier. This could lead to a western front opening against the Soviet Union well before the historical D-Day invasion of 1944. Overall, this alternate history presents a Europe where political ideology, rather than national rivalries, draws the battle lines. The pragmatic alliances forged to contain communism could overshadow historical grievances and create a continental struggle where the primary axis of conflict is between democratic-monarchist coalitions and global communist movements."},{"prompt":"Another thing in this timeline is that Reinhard Heydrich in this timeline, becomes a fighter ace in the Luftwaffe. SA leader Ernst Rohm gets assassinated by a Austrian nationalist but the Monarchist government in Germany doesn't care about it. Willhelm II goes back to Germany in 1939 and dies in 1941 just like in our timeline.","completion":"In your alternate history scenario, the roles and fates of several key historical figures differ from our timeline in intriguing ways: 1. **Reinhard Heydrich**: Known in our timeline as one of the main architects of the Holocaust and a high-ranking Nazi official, Heydrich becoming a Luftwaffe fighter ace represents a significant departure from his historical path. An illustrious military career might have kept him away from the internal security services and the type of power he wielded during the Nazi regime. However, his prowess as a fighter pilot would likely have made him a celebrated military figure in Germany. 2. **Ernst Rohm's Assassination**: Ernst Rohm's assassination by an Austrian nationalist and the German monarchist government's indifference to it suggest that the tension between the SA (Sturmabteilung), representing a more radical Nazi faction, and the more conservative monarchist and military establishment remains high. This indicates a potential purge or marginalization of the SA's influence in the alternate timeline, further stabilizing the monarchists' control over Germany. 3. **Return and Death of Wilhelm II**: The return to Germany of Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1939, mirroring his actual death in 1941, suggests that despite his presence, the political structure of Germany remains a constitutional monarchy with limited power for the Kaiser, considering the monarchists had taken power in 1933. His death could be a symbolic moment for Germany, potentially leading to a period of national mourning and signaling the end of an era while cementing the new political reality of monarchist rule. The changes to the biographies of these figures in your alternate timeline also carry broader implications for the world: - Without Heydrich's role in the SS and his hand in orchestrating the Holocaust, the systematic persecution of Jews and other minorities might be less organized or might take a different form under the Monarchist regime. - As for the political dynamics within Germany, Rohm's assassination reinforces that potential threats to the new regime's stability are dealt with swiftly, even if they originate from nationalist or populist factions. It indicates a strong consolidation of power by those controlling the government, perhaps similar to the Night of the Long Knives but with different targets. - The figurehead status of Wilhelm II implies that the monarch's role is ceremonial rather than executive, with real power likely resting in the hands of politicians, generals, or the ruling aristocracy. This setup would be similar to the role of modern constitutional monarchies. Each of these points serves to outline a Europe that has evolved quite differently from our history, with internal German politics and broader European alliances focused around a balance of power, nationalist sentiments, and responses to communist ideologies rather than fascism and Nazism. The shift in roles for key figures would accompany a shift in historical narratives, national identities, and the political makeup of Europe, potentially leading to different social attitudes, cultural developments, and priorities in domestic and foreign policy. Such an alternate history is a fertile ground for exploration across a broad range of topics, from conflict dynamics and international relations to cultural and technological development."},{"prompt":"The USSR invades Poland on the 1st of September 1939, they then invaded Romania in 1940, then Czechoslovakia and annexed Yugoslavia which was already communist. They also attempted to have another go at invading Finland. From 1940-1941, Germany sent supplies to Polish partisans before beginning operations with the allies to attack to the USSR. The US joined the war in 1942 and fought in Italy, Croatia and Yugoslavia.","completion":"Your alternate history scenario envisions a world in which the Soviet Union is cast as the primary aggressor in Europe during the late 1930s and early 1940s, leading to a coalition of Allied powers that includes the United States, the United Kingdom, a monarchist Germany, and other European nations joining forces against Soviet expansion. Here's how this might play out: 1. **Soviet Invasion of Poland**: The Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 would likely be condemned by the European powers, especially given an earlier consensus (as per your previous messages) to safeguard Polish sovereignty. This aggressive act would be the catalyst for an anti-Soviet alliance. 2. **Subsequent Soviet Expansion**: The USSR pushing into Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, while also trying to subjugate Finland, suggests a Soviet strategy of creating a broad buffer zone or sphere of influence in Eastern Europe. Each of these actions would further solidify the anti-Soviet coalition's resolve. 3. **Communist Yugoslavia**: The annexation of an already communist Yugoslavia indicates a broader tide of communist sentiment in the Balkans, which the Soviet invasion may seek to capitalize on. This could create a patchwork of ideologies that would stir resistance movements and civil conflict within these territories. 4. **German Support for Polish Partisans**: Germany's aid to the Polish resistance would be a dramatic departure from the historical occupation, emphasizing a shared opposition to Soviet encroachment as a unifying factor between the two nations. 5. **Allied Operations Against the USSR**: The launch of combined operations to repel Soviet advances marks the full engagement of the Allies. This would possibly involve multiple fronts, including direct engagement through Eastern Europe and possible support for resistance movements within Soviet-occupied territories. 6. **US Entry into the War**: The US entering the war significantly escalates the conflict, adding substantial industrial and military resources to the Allied effort. The American focus on fighting in Italy and the Balkans indicates efforts to liberate these regions from communist rule and to secure the Mediterranean and Southern Europe. The global conflict in this scenario reflects a complete reversal of alliances from World War II in our timeline, with the following potential consequences: - The nature of the war would likely be one of liberation, with the goal of rolling back Soviet expansions rather than defeating fascism. - The war might center on guerrilla tactics and partisan warfare, with significant battles occurring in regions like the forests of Poland, the mountains of Yugoslavia, and the urban centers of Italy. - The political dynamics of post-war Europe would be redefined, with occupied nations potentially returning to pre-Soviet government forms or establishing new, non-communist regimes. - Cold War dynamics would be born out of a very different context, with the possibility of an earlier start and a different configuration of power blocs. - The role of nuclear weapons is uncertain in this scenario, as the development of atomic bombs was historically driven by the need to end the Pacific War against Japan. In this alternate timeline, with the war's focus on Europe, the impetus for their creation might differ, altering the timeline for their introduction. - The absence of a significant war in the Pacific means Japan's role in this alternate global conflict would be uncertain, and the US might not have the same historical pivot to Asia post-war. This scenario would see Europe as the primary theater of conflict, with other regions of the world affected differently. The ideological struggle would focus on communism versus a coalition of democratic, monarchist, and possibly other forms of government. The geopolitical landscape post-war would be shaped by the victorious powers and their influence in reconstructing the political order in Europe and beyond."},{"prompt":"The USSR invades Finland in 1941 in the spring. They make it as far as the town of Tampere, where they begin getting pushed back from the 23rd of August 1942 to the 2nd of February 1943. The Soviet army did have some units that were specially trained in winter warfare that at the time were in Siberia and in some cases, lead to some friendly fire incidents, either from soviets mistaking their squadmates for finns or finns mistaking their squadmates for soviets.","completion":"In this envisioned scenario, the Soviet offensive into Finland appears to mirror an intensified continuation of the historical Winter War, where the USSR attempted to assert control over Finnish territory but faced strong resistance. Here are some insights into how this might affect your alternate timeline: 1. **Soviet Invasion Timing**: Launching a major invasion in the spring of 1941 would give the Soviet Union an initial advantage by avoiding the harsh winter conditions that impeded their progress during the historical Winter War. However, as the operation extends into the winter, they would inevitably face the challenges of Finland's harsh climate and resilient defense. 2. **Battle for Tampere**: The city of Tampere becoming a focal point for a turnaround in the Finnish defense signifies a significant moment in the conflict. A successful defense and counteroffensive would galvanize Finnish resistance and could serve as a symbolic victory, much like the defense of the Karelian Isthmus in the Winter War. 3. **Trained Soviet Units**: The fact that the USSR has specially trained winter warfare units suggests that they learned from the Winter War and sought to address their previous shortcomings. However, friendly fire incidents due to uniform confusion reflect the chaos and challenges of winter combat, where limited visibility and snow camouflage can lead to tragic mistakes. 4. **International Response**: Given the European coalition against Soviet aggression detailed in previous messages, the invasion of Finland may prompt additional military support for Finland from the Allies. This could take the form of supplies, volunteers, or direct military intervention. 5. **Finnish Resilience**: Finland demonstrated remarkable tenacity during the Winter War, and this continuation of resistance would further foster national unity and determination against Soviet occupation, potentially inspiring other nations under Soviet threat. 6. **Impact on the USSR**: The protracted campaign in Finland would strain the Soviet military and potentially divert resources from other fronts (such as against German, French, and British forces elsewhere in Europe). It would also tarnish the Red Army's reputation, particularly if the specially trained winter units failed to make significant gains. 7. **Wartime Diplomacy and Alliances**: If Finland is holding its own with the support of the Allies, this could lead to a stronger coalition constraining Soviet expansion and influencing the post-war settlement of borders and spheres of influence. 8. **Technological and Tactical Developments**: Combat in Finland might spur advancements in cold-weather warfare, from clothing and equipment to tactics suited for fighting in a snowy environment, which could have broader applications for militaries around the world. 9. **Home Front in the USSR**: A protracted conflict could affect Soviet morale and raise questions on the home front, especially if casualties mount and the war effort falters. 10. **Role of Neutral Countries**: This phase of the conflict could change the stance of historically neutral countries like Sweden, which might be pressured to provide indirect support to Finland or even join the Allied coalition, depending on the balance of power and Soviet aggression. The Finnish front in this alternate timeline exemplifies the many layers of conflict presenting themselves across Europe, and it serves as a microcosm for the larger struggle between the Soviet Union and the Allies. The determination of the Finnish people in the face of a formidable adversary would continue to resonate as an emblem of resistance against overwhelming odds."},{"prompt":"compare ce cv et cette job description et explique en plusieurs points pourquoi c'est un candidat interessant pour le poste CV COMPÉTENCES Maîtrise du parcours client des principaux acteurs IRVE Suivi et pilotage de KPIs Autonomie & flexibilité Méthode Agile - certification Suite Office - maîtrise Enquêtes Clients Réseaux Sociaux - Google My Business, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube CONTACT 06 61 22 94 75 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_URL> Paris 13ème, France Permis B MAXIME KHIMA CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGER EXPÉRIENCE PROFESSIONNELLE CHEF DE PROJET MARKETING JUNIOR PEUGEOT FRANCE CHEF DE PROJET EXPÉRIENCE CLIENT RENAULT FRANCE Poissy - Groupe PSA, janvier à juillet 2018 Le Plessis-Robinson - Capgemini, 2021 à aujourd'hui Accompagner le lancement de nouveaux véhicules : présentations produit et fiches tarifaires Analyser les KPIs commerciaux et les présenter en comités Effectuer une veille concurrentielle et technologique des services connectés embarqués Développer des supports de communication hors média du brief à la livraison dans le respect de la qualité, du budget et des délais Suivre et piloter les KPIs de satisfaction client sur le périmètre France pour les ventes de véhicules neufs Renault, Dacia et Alpine Collecter et analyser les retours clients, conseiller le réseau sur les plans d’action d’amélioration de l’expérience client à mettre en place Gérer l’évolution du projet E-Reputation France, de la construction du projet à la phase de fonctionnement normal Garantir une relation efficace entre le siège et le réseau, centraliser la relation avec les interlocuteurs sur le terrain et les responsables qualité des groupes de concessions LANGUES Anglais courant (écrit et oral) - Toeic 845 Espagnol intermédiaire CHARGÉ D’ÉTUDES PARCOURS CLIENT Le Plessis-Robinson - Capgemini, 2018 à 2021 Analyser l’évolution des KPIs des parcours clients véhicules neufs et après-vente Renault & Dacia Identifier des actions d’amélioration de l’expérience client et les traduire en plans d’action pour les groupes de concessionnaires INSEEC BUSINESS SCHOOL Bordeaux, 2016-2018 - Master 2 Marketing & Business Development FORMATION UNIVERSITE FRANÇOIS RABELAIS Tours, 2012-2016 - Licence 3 Économie CENTRES D’INTÉRÊT Automobile et ses enjeux actuels Mobilité durable Nouvelles technologies Energies renouvelables Job description Customer Relationship Manager Dans un futur proche, la place de la mobilité dans la ville va changer.

I need a conclusive answer, and go over the skills each possess","completion":"To provide a conclusive answer, one needs to consider what the primary functions and responsibilities of the senior officer in your software business will entail. A software business, while certainly involving financial management and potentially engineering components as it relates to software development, may require a unique set of skills that go beyond these two areas. Here is a comparison of the skills each candidate might bring based on their backgrounds: 1. **Professional Accountant:** - **Financial Acumen:** With 7 years of experience leading a finance company and 20 years in the field, the accountant likely has robust knowledge in financial planning, analysis, budgeting, and fiscal management, which are critical for the profitability of any business. - **Regulatory Compliance:** Understanding complex financial regulations and ensuring compliance would be second nature given their background. - **Strategic Planning:** An experienced finance professional is likely skilled in strategic planning and performance monitoring, key to any senior role. - **Risk Management:** Identifying and mitigating financial risks would be a strong suit. - **Attention to Detail:** Accountancy demands great attention to detail, beneficial in managing complex, multifaceted projects. 2. **Engineer:** - **Technical Expertise:** With a background in leading an engineering firm, the engineer should have a solid understanding of technical processes, innovation, and problem-solving, which could be highly beneficial if the software business is highly technical and product-driven. - **Project Management:** Engineers often excel in project management, which includes planning, executing, and finalizing projects according to strict deadlines and within budget. - **Analytical Skills:** They typically possess strong analytical skills for analyzing data and systems, potentially useful for making data-driven decisions in the software industry. - **Quality Control:** An inherent part of engineering is maintaining high standards of quality, which would be advantageous in a software context. - **Knowledge of Tech Trends:** If their experience is current, they might be more in tune with the latest technological trends, including software development practices and methodologies (such as Agile or Scrum). **Important Considerations:** - **Industry Knowledge:** Does the position require more in-depth knowledge of the software industry, or is it more geared towards financial and business management? The accountant might excel in the latter, while the engineer could potentially be more attuned to the former. - **Leadership and Management Skills:** Both roles being leadership roles, it's important to assess their ability to lead teams, make decisions, and drive a business forward. Both candidates likely have these skills, but how they apply them could be different. - **Adaptability:** How well can each adapt to the unique challenges and rapid changes typical in the software industry? - **Vision and Innovation:** A software business often requires creativity and an ability to envision and react to market opportunities. The candidate's history of innovation and strategic growth initiatives would be important. - **Cultural Fit:** How well does each candidate fit within the culture of your organization? This can be just as crucial as their professional skills. Without more specific information on the actual responsibilities, company goals, the role's emphasis on technology versus finance, and the current skills makeup of the existing leadership team, it would be challenging to make a definitive recommendation. The best fit greatly depends on which elements are more important for your business' success. If financial structuration and business management are paramount, the accountant may have an edge. Conversely, if product development and technical leadership are critical, the engineer would be the stronger candidate. In both cases, one should not overlook the importance of soft skills and leadership potential, as well as each candidate's willingness and ability to learn about the software industry and its nuances. It will be essential to conduct thorough interviews and reference checks to determine the best fit for your organization."},{"prompt":"the position they are being offered is more geared toward developing the business, some one who can improve the revenue inflow of the business in next 5 years, they should be a good and quick problem solver, and be ready to learn, also should posses strong leadership ability and people management skills, talk to shareholders and directors frequently. they are expected to have a very high sales skill. We have conduced a screen of both the candidates, and both appears to be equally strong, so please help us select the appropriate candidate as the livelihood of thousands of employees and a business is at stake","completion":"Judging by your description of the position—a role focused on business development, improving revenue, strong and quick problem-solving abilities, readiness to learn, strong leadership and people management skills, frequent communication with shareholders and directors, and very high sales skills—we can further refine the evaluation of your two candidates: the professional accountant with a background in finance, and the engineer with a background leading an engineering firm. **Professional Accountant's Potential Strengths:** - **Financial Strategy:** A strong financial background is beneficial for identifying opportunities for increasing revenue and efficiency. - **Investor Relations:** Their experience is likely to include regularly communicating financial metrics and business strategies to investors and stakeholders. - **Sales Skills:** Depending on their experience, they may have sales experience in the context of selling financial products or services, although this might not directly translate to software sales. - **Budget and Revenue Management:** Ensuring that all business development activities are cost-effective and generate a positive return on investment would be a strong point. **Engineer's Potential Strengths:** - **Technical Sales:** If they have worked in an engineering firm related to software or technology, they could possess a solid understanding of technical sales, which can be extremely valuable in selling software solutions. - **Innovation and Product Development:** Engineers are often skilled at understanding customer needs and designing solutions, which can drive business growth in tech-oriented markets. - **Technical Problem Solving:** An engineering background lends itself to quick and logical problem-solving, a key attribute for fast-paced software business scenarios. - **Communicating Technical Information:** They might be more adept at speaking about technical matters to non-technical stakeholders. **Considerations for Decision:** 1. **Sales**: Which candidate has demonstrated stronger sales abilities, particularly in a context similar to software or technology? Sales skills are critical for revenue growth. 2. **Communication:** Does either candidate have a proven track record of effectively communicating complex ideas to a varied audience, including shareholders, directors, and team members? 3. **Adaptability and Learning Curve:** Which candidate has shown the ability to quickly adapt to new industries or sectors and learn new concepts? 4. **Leadership and People Management:** Leadership and people skills are vital. You've screened both candidates and found them equally strong, but consider who has the vision and charisma to inspire employees and lead the company into new revenue-generating ventures. 5. **Networking and Relationships:** The ability to build strong relationships will be key for business growth; consider who might have a better network and relationship-building skills. 6. **Cultural Fit and Vision for the Company:** Who seems more aligned with your company's culture and long-term vision? Understanding and integrating into the company culture is instrumental for leading a business successfully. Given that both candidates seem equally capable, the decision might ultimately boil down to soft skills and perceived potential to grow within the industry. In the absence of significant differentiation in these areas, it could also be worth considering a trial period where candidates are given real-world challenges to tackle or are asked to give a detailed presentation of their strategies to grow the business. This can provide further insights into their thinking processes, problem-solving abilities, and how they would handle the responsibilities attached to the position. Interviews with key team members and stakeholders they would collaborate with can also elicit valuable feedback to inform the final decision. Remember, the best candidate on paper might not always be the best fit for the company culture or the specific team they will lead."},{"prompt":"okay, the position is CEO role, is it wise to eliminate the accountant as he may not be have less experience with software compared to an engineer?","completion":"When it comes to selecting a CEO for a software business, choosing the right candidate should not be solely based on the specific industry background (software versus finance in this case), but rather on a holistic assessment of their leadership qualities, their ability to grasp and lead the company through the multifaceted challenges it faces, their strategic vision, and their potential to drive the company towards financial success. **Considerations for the CEO Role:** 1. **Strategic Vision and Execution:** The CEO should be able to develop and execute a strategic vision for the company. This requires an understanding of the current market, the competitive landscape, technological trends, and customer needs. 2. **Industry Insight and Adaptability:** While industry experience can be beneficial, the ability to quickly understand and adapt to the industry may be more crucial. A candidate may not have direct software industry experience but might possess the capability to understand its intricacies rapidly, recognize its challenges, and lead effectively. 3. **Leadership and Culture:** The CEO sets the tone for the company culture and must be able to inspire and lead the team. Leadership experience and the ability to fit within or even shape the company culture are crucial. 4. **Financial Acumen:** No matter the industry, a CEO needs to be able to make informed financial decisions. The accountant's experience would undoubtedly be valuable in this regard, especially if the company is seeking to improve financial performance or navigate complex investment scenarios. 5. **Stakeholder Communication:** Both candidates must be skilled in communicating with different stakeholders such as investors, board members, employees, and customers. A CEO must be able to articulate the company’s value, its mission, and how it plans to succeed. 6. **Innovation and Responsiveness:** The tech industry is innovative and fast-paced. The CEO needs to foster an environment of innovation and respond quickly to market changes. 7. **Sales and Business Development:** Finally, a CEO in this environment must have a strong understanding of the sales process and how to drive revenue growth. This expertise is vital in a leadership role and may not be inherent in either a finance or engineering background but could have been acquired through previous roles or experiences. **Conclusion:** While the engineer may have more relevant industry experience, it’s not necessarily a conclusive reason to eliminate the accountant from contention for the CEO role. The right CEO for a software company will have a blend of business savvy, an understanding of the technology, the ability to adapt and learn quickly, and possess strong leadership and communication skills. It's also important to consider that a CEO doesn't work in isolation—they oversee a team of executives, each of whom brings specific expertise to the table. If the accountant candidate possesses a strong leadership profile, financial expertise, excellent strategic orientation, and the willingness to deeply understand the software domain, they may very well be a strong contender for the CEO position, especially if they are complemented by a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) or other technical executives who have deep software industry expertise. Ultimately, the decision should be based on which candidate shows the most potential to lead the company towards achieving its specific goals—increasing revenue, expanding the business, cultivating innovation, and ensuring a solid financial footing—taking into consideration all the attributes and skills they bring to the role. An in-depth interview focusing on strategic, leadership, and industry-related queries and scenarios could be the final step in making this critical choice."},{"prompt":"who has the upperhand when it comes to critical thinking, creative solutions?","completion":"The ability to engage in critical thinking and propose creative solutions are competencies that aren't tied to one's professional background as an accountant or engineer inherently; rather, they are more closely linked to an individual's personality, intelligence, mindset, and experiences. **For the Accountant:** The skill set of a professional accountant would likely include a high degree of analytical thinking, attention to detail, and systematic problem-solving abilities, which are all components of critical thinking. Their financial expertise could enable them to provide creative fiscal solutions for cost savings, investment opportunities, and revenue growth. **For the Engineer:** Engineers are trained to use critical thinking to solve complex problems and are often required to be innovative, designing solutions that may not yet exist. They may excel at process analysis and optimization, which can translate into innovative strategies for product development, operational efficiency, or market expansion. **Evaluating the Candidates:** To determine who has the upper hand in critical thinking and creative solutions, you might consider the following approaches: - **Past Achievements:** Evaluate the candidates' past achievements for evidence of innovative problem-solving and strategic decision-making in their respective fields. - **Behavioral Interviews:** Ask questions that require the candidate to describe situations where they had to use critical thinking and creativity. Probe into how they approached complex problems, what obstacles they faced, and how they overcame them. - **Case Studies or Scenarios:** Present each candidate with hypothetical or past business scenarios specific to your company and see how they would analyze the situation, identify issues, and propose solutions. - **References:** Speak with individuals who have worked with the candidates in a capacity where these skills were tested. It cannot be stressed enough that the \\"upper hand\\" is subjective and situational. It will depend on how each individual has cultivated these skills over their career and how they've applied them. Always remember that the dynamic nature of a CEO role often requires not only the individual's ability to think critically and creatively but also their capacity to foster and draw upon these skills within their team. Ultimately, without direct assessment or evidence of past performance, it would be challenging to say definitively which candidate possesses stronger critical thinking and creative solution skills. The best approach is to carefully vet and challenge the candidates through interviews, assessments, and references to inform your decision."},{"prompt":"Amend, revise, and personalize the following letter where applicable with information from the following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O%27Neal Cameron McCaffrey c/o Boca Raton Achievement Center 500 NE Spanish River Blvd., Suite 30 Boca Raton, FL 33431 cmccaff1@fau.edu +1 (561) 559-9768 Wednesday, January 24, 2024 Mr. Shaquille O’Neal c/o Mine O’ Mine, Inc.

Here are the points of comparison: 1. Address: The given addresses are different. Person 1 resides at \\"100 Diversy Wy,\\" whereas the individual as per Experian's records resides at \\"123 Chicago Way.\\" Both addresses are in Chicago, IL with the same ZIP code 60061, so the person may have moved or there could be an error or variation in recording the address information. 2. Name: The core components of the names (first name \\"John\\" vs. \\"Jhn,\\" middle name \\"M\\" vs. \\"Moe,\\" and last name \\"Togo\\") are similar but not identical. The first name in the Experian data may be a typographical error or a misspelling (\\"John\\" misspelled as \\"Jhn\\"). The middle name, however, is significantly different (\\"M\\" vs. \\"Moe\\"), which could indicate a mistake or that Person 1 uses an initial, while Experian has a full middle name that starts with the same letter. 3. Social Security Number (SSN): The SSN provided by Person 1 is in the standard format with dashes (\\"123-12-1234\\"), while the SSN from Experian has the dashes removed (\\"123121234\\"). However, the sequence of numbers is the same, indicating it may be the same SSN, with Experian's record simply omitting the dashes. 4. Date of Birth (DOB): The DOB is identical in both cases (\\"12/21/1997\\"), suggesting that it could be the same person, as the chance of two individuals having the exact same date of birth and similar names is less common. Based on the identical DOB and SSN, it is likely that this is the same person with potential typographical errors, incomplete information, or variations in how the personal information was recorded in Experian's database.

I want to go into the details of this is going to work and what the backend requirements would be for such a system. I have a few considerations jotted down. • Define roles and responsibilities: Start by identifying the different roles within your platform (e.g., user, underwriter, admin) and their associated responsibilities. This will help you determine who needs to be notified for each type of event. • Identify key events: List the events that should trigger notifications, such as application submission, moving to underwriting, approval, and rejection. • Design notification templates: Create notification templates for each type of event, ensuring that the content is relevant and informative for the intended recipients. • Implement role-based permissions: Set up role-based permissions to control who can receive notifications for each event. This can be done using a role-permission matrix that maps roles to the events they should be notified about. • Create a notification service: Develop a notification service that listens for events in your application and sends notifications to the appropriate users based on their roles and permissions. • Store notifications: Consider storing notifications in a database to keep track of which users have been notified and when. This will help you troubleshoot any issues and provide an audit trail. • Handle delivery failures: Implement a mechanism to handle delivery failures, such as retrying failed notifications or alerting an administrator. • Monitor and improve: Regularly monitor the performance of your notification system and gather feedback from users. Use this information to identify and address any issues and make improvements. Customization: Allow users to customize their notification preferences, such as the types of events they want to be notified about and their preferred delivery channels. Let me know how to proceed.","completion":"Building a notification center for your product involves several steps, from planning and design to implementation and monitoring. Given that you've already jotted down several key considerations, you're off to a good start. Here's a detailed roadmap on how you might proceed, outlining the backend requirements and potential technologies you could use. # Steps and Backend Requirements 1. **Requirements Gathering:** - Document the requirements based on the considerations you've provided. - Create user stories and acceptance criteria for the notification system. 2. **Database Design:** - Model your data to include entities like \`User\`, \`Role\`, \`Event\`, \`Notification\`, \`NotificationTemplate\`, and \`UserNotificationPreferences\`. - Design the database schema accordingly. 3. **API Endpoint Creation:** - Develop RESTful endpoints or GraphQL mutations to handle CRUD operations for notifications and preferences. - Secure endpoints with authentication and authorization layers (e.g., OAuth, JWT). 4. **Notification Service Development:** - Build a notification service capable of: - Listening for key events triggered in the application. - Processing these events to determine which notifications to generate. - Choose a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for event-driven architecture. - Implement publishers and subscribers for different event types. 5. **Template Management:** - Create a template engine to populate notification templates with dynamic content. - Store templates in a format (e.g., HTML for emails) that can be easily modified. 6. **Role-Based Permissions:** - Implement a role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage roles and permissions. - Map event types to roles and set up the logic to determine allowed notifications. 7. **Notification Distribution:** - Incorporate different delivery channels (email, SMS, push notifications, in-app messages). - Integrate with third-party services (SMTP server for email, Twilio/SendGrid for SMS, Firebase for push notifications). 8. **Notification Queue and Storage:** - Implement a queuing system for outbound notifications to control load and handle retries (e.g., using a delayed job queue like Sidekiq). - Store notifications in the database, marking their status (pending, sent, failed, etc.). 9. **Failure Handling:** - Develop a failure management subsystem: - Logic to retry sending notifications a specified number of times. - Notifications for admins on repeated failures. 10. **User Preferences Handling:** - Provide endpoints for users to manage their notification preferences. - Implement logic to check these preferences before sending notifications. 11. **Monitoring and Logging:** - Write comprehensive logs for the notification sending process. - Use a monitoring tool (e.g., Datadog, Prometheus) to track the system's health and performance. 12. **UI/UX Implementation:** - Develop frontend elements for managing preferences and viewing notifications. - Ensure the notification center is intuitive and accessible to all users. 13. **Testing and Quality Assurance:** - Write unit and integration tests for your notification system (consider using a testing framework like Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript or RSpec for Ruby). - Continuously test the system to ensure reliability, especially under different load circumstances. 14. **Deployment and Scaling:** - Deploy the notification system to a production environment (this could involve containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes, if scale is a consideration). - Ensure the architecture is scalable to handle increased loads as your user base grows. 15. **Feedback Loop and Improvement:** - After the initial launch, gather user feedback. - Iterate on the notification system, adding new features or streamlining existing processes. During each of these steps, regular communication with stakeholders, including potential users, will be essential for ensuring the notification system meets practical needs and usability standards. Make sure to adhere to personal data protection regulations (like GDPR or CCPA) when designing and implementing your notification system."},{"prompt":"I am a product manager, help me identify various requirements for such a platform and help me create user stories and acceptance criteria.","completion":"As a product manager looking to create a notification center for your product, you will need to gather both functional and non-functional requirements. Here are some examples of both, followed by user stories and their acceptance criteria. # Functional Requirements: 1. **User Registration for Notifications** - Users should be able to register and subscribe to different types of notifications. 2. **Customizable Notification Preferences** - Users should be able to choose their preferred notification channels (e.g., email, SMS, in-app) and the types of notifications they receive. 3. **Notification Creation and Management** - Admins should be able to create and manage notification templates. 4. **Real-time Notification Delivery** - The platform should detect trigger events and send notifications in real-time or near real-time. 5. **Notification History and Audit Log** - The system should maintain a log of all sent notifications for audit and tracking purposes. 6. **Role-Based Access Control** - The system should support roles with different permissions for managing and receiving notifications. # Non-Functional Requirements: 1. **Scalability** - The system should be able to scale to handle an increasing number of users and notifications. 2. **Reliability** - Notifications should be guaranteed to deliver with mechanisms to handle failures and retries. 3. **Security** - Personal user data and notification content should be secure, with data transferred over encrypted channels. 4. **Performance** - Notifications should be sent with minimal delay from the time of the trigger event. 5. **Maintainability** - The system should be easy to maintain, with well-documented code and clear architecture. 6. **Compliance** - Must comply with data protection and privacy regulations relevant to the business (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). # User Stories and Acceptance Criteria User Story 1: As a registered user, I want to set my notification preferences so that I only receive relevant notifications through my preferred channels. **Acceptance Criteria:** - A user is able to access the notification preferences section in their account settings. - The user can choose from a list of notification types to subscribe to or unsubscribe from. - The user can select their preferred notification channels (email, SMS, in-app). - Changes to notification preferences are saved and take effect immediately. User Story 2: As an admin, I want to be able to create and modify notification templates to ensure appropriate messaging is sent for each event. **Acceptance Criteria:** - An admin can access a user interface to create new notification templates. - Notification templates can be associated with specific trigger events. - Admins can edit and modify existing notification templates. - The system saves changes to templates and displays the active version to admins. User Story 3: As a user, I want to receive instant notifications when specific events occur so that I am informed promptly and can take necessary action. **Acceptance Criteria:** - Notifications are sent immediately after the occurrence of a subscribed event. - The user receives notifications in the format specified in their preferences. - Notifications contain relevant information to the user for the trigger event. User Story 4: As an operations manager, I need to access a complete log of sent notifications to troubleshoot issues and prove compliance with regulations. **Acceptance Criteria:** - The system records each notification sent, including timestamp, recipient, and content. - An operations manager can query the log for specific time periods, users, or event types. - The log is secured and only accessible by authorized personnel. Once you've identified your user stories and accepted criteria, you can begin working with the development team to prioritize these in the backlog and start the implementation process in iterative cycles (e.g., sprints in Agile methodology). Throughout the development, continue to validate your requirements with actual users and stakeholders to ensure the notification center meets their needs effectively."},{"prompt":"when","completion":"It seems like your question is incomplete.

In this context, dramatic irony might suggest that the husband and brothers will not return as expected due to some unfortunate event that the audience is aware of but the speaker is not. For instance, if you're dealing with a plot in which it is known to the audience that the husband and brothers have been involved in an accident or some incident during their shooting excursion that will prevent them from returning as usual – or at all – the statement would be dramatically ironic. The character expects a normal return and is possibly preparing for it, completely unaware of the misfortune that has befallen her loved ones, while the audience is aware and feels the poignancy of her ignorance. Dramatic irony is often used as a literary device to create tension or emotional effect, as the audience anticipates the moment when the character will discover the truth of the situation."},{"prompt":"“my husband and brothers will be home directly from shooting, and they always come in this way.\\" show how this is an example of dramatic irony, the story is \\"The open window\\" by saki","completion":"In Saki's short story \\"The Open Window,\\" dramatic irony occurs as the reader obtains knowledge of the true nature of the situation, which contrasts with the beliefs of the characters within the story, particularly Mr. Nuttel. The quote \\"my husband and brothers will be home directly from shooting, and they always come in this way\\" is spoken by Mrs. Sappleton, who is unaware that her niece, Vera, has just told Mr. Nuttel a fabricated story. Vera has deceitfully informed Mr. Nuttel that Mrs. Sappleton's husband and brothers died in a tragic hunting accident three years ago and that she keeps the window open because she's expecting them to return. Dramatic irony arises here because the reader knows that Vera's story is concocted, while Mr. Nuttel, who believes the story to be true, perceives the imminent arrival of the men in a vastly different light. When Mr. Nuttel sees Mrs. Sappleton's husband and brothers approaching the house, his horror at witnessing what he believes to be ghosts from the past causes him to flee in panic. The dramatic irony is further amplified by Mrs. Sappleton's normal expectation and anticipation of her husband and brothers' return, which starkly contrasts with Mr. Nuttel's mistaken belief due to Vera's deception, ultimately leading to a humorously misinterpreted situation where the distinction between reality and fiction becomes blurred for the unwitting Mr. Nuttel."},{"prompt":"repetir mais detalhado e com subtopicos: Se você ainda não conhece o Tu Winner Bot Estratégia de Investimento, está prestes a descobrir uma revolução tecnológica no universo dos investimentos.

A cada término de contrato, que geralmente dura de dois a quatro anos, você pode optar por um modelo mais recente. Isso significa ter sempre um carro novo na garagem, sem as preocupações de venda ou depreciação acelerada. **Benefícios Tecnológicos** Com a tecnologia automotiva progredindo a velocidades impressionantes, o leasing oferece a chance de estar sempre atualizado com as últimas tendências e inovações. Isso não só traz satisfação em dirigir um veículo topo de linha, mas também pode significar benefícios em segurança, economia de combustível e recursos de conectividade. **Modelos em Destaque para Leasing** - **Volkswagen Polo** - Este modelo destaca-se por sua elegância atemporal, aliada a um desempenho confiável e um nível de conforto que poucos da sua classe oferecem.

Вот пример промпта для генерации логотипа: 1. **Назначение логотипа**: - Описать бренд/компанию/организацию, для которой создается логотип. - Определить основную аудиторию бренда и её предпочтения. 2. **Цветовая палитра**: - Выбрать основные и дополнительные цвета. - Описать предпочтения в цветовых схемах (яркие, сочные цвета; пастельные тона; строгая черно-белая гамма и т.д.). 3. **Стиль дизайна**: - Минималистичный, сложный, ретро, современный, абстрактный, и т.д. - Оформление (растровое или векторное, плоское или объемное, геометрическое или органическое). 4. **Типографика**: - Наличие или отсутствие буквенного обозначения в логотипе. - Стиль шрифта (серифный, безсерифный, рукописный, декоративный). 5. **Символика**: - Должен ли логотип включать какие-то конкретные символы, формы или элементы? - Определить имеют ли эти элементы и символы конкретное значение для бренда (например, животные, предметы, абстрактные иконки). 6. **Особые требования**: - Учесть какие-либо ограничения, например, размеры или применяемость на различных поверхностях. 7. **Примеры**: - Предоставить ссылки или описания логотипов, которые похожи на желаемый стиль. После того как вы определите эти параметры, вам нужно будет сформулировать четкий и конкретный текстовый запрос (промпт). Например: \\"Создайте современный минималистичный логотип для стартапа в сфере технологий, названного 'TechFlow'. Цветовая схема должна быть сине-серебристая.

I'm originally from Paris and traveled the world over the last 20 years, starting and developping small businesses, leading sales operations across diverse sectors, including tech, digital marketing, search engine, e-commerce, and real estate. On 2019, I moved to Hamburg, Germany, with my partner, Katharina, to be closer to her friends and family, and to explore new horizons. On last 2020, Katharina gave birth to our beautiful son, and due to Covid-19 restrictions, we had the opportunity to move the house next to her parents, in the country side on Hamburg, in the town of Drage. During 2 years I have been carrying the role of a stay-at-home dad. On last January 2023, I found a position as Sales Manager for a tech giant, spearheading market expansion. The office is located in the center of Hamburg, 30 to 45 min driving distance from Drage. After 6 hard months, on June 2023, the company didn't extended the trial period and I became unemployed. Since then, I have been searching for different Sales positions in Hamburg, without any success. Today I am thinking about spreading my entrepreneurial wings again. Drage is a municipality in the district of Harburg, Lower Saxony. Lower Saxony is one of Germany largest department. In my area and within a driving distance of 20km North, West, South, East, there are about 5 bigger towns among many smaller ones: Drage, Marschacht, Tespe, Handorf. In 2021, the estimated number of inhabitants in these towns was as follows: Drage: 4237 Marschacht: 3993 Tespe: 4849 Handorf: 2121 It should be noted that at Stover Strand, a sandy beach on the Elbe 5 km from Drage, there is a very popular camping site that attracts thousands of visitors between May and October. In the last 5 years this area, like many areas within a 30 minute drive of Hamburg, has boomed. As a result, the population in this area is getting much younger and most families have good incomes. In this particular area mentioned earlier, services are poor. Apart from schools, kindergartens, supermarkets, bakeries and a few restaurants, there is only one shop selling kebabs, burgers and pizzas. This place is a gold mine and is only closed on Mondays. This lack of service is quite frustrating and many of my friends and people I talk to really complain about it. So I'm wondering if it's worth exploring the possibility of setting up a food orientated business and would need your expertise and advice. What is your opinion?","completion":"Hello Sebastien, Based on the insights you've provided, it seems like there is a potential opportunity for starting a food-oriented business, particularly in an area that is experiencing growth and has a younger population with disposable income. However, there are many factors to consider before making such a decision. Here are some points that could help guide your thought process: 1. Market Research: Conduct thorough market research to understand the preferences and needs of the local population. Identify if there are any particular cuisines or types of food that the area lacks but has a demand for. 2. Competition Analysis: Assess the performance of the existing food outlet selling kebabs, burgers, and pizzas. Understand why it is considered a \\"gold mine\\" and identify potential gaps in the market that your business could fill. 3. Location: Choose a strategic location that is accessible to the target demographic and has sufficient foot traffic. Proximity to the popular camping site could be advantageous, especially during the visitor season. 4. Business Plan: Develop a detailed business plan outlining your concept, financial projections, marketing strategy, and operational details. Ensure you have a unique selling proposition (USP) that differentiates you from the competition. 5. Legal and Regulatory Considerations: Familiarize yourself with the local laws and regulations related to starting a food business, including permits, food safety regulations, and zoning laws. 6. Capital and Cost Management: Evaluate how much capital you will need to start and sustain the business, considering all startup costs and ongoing expenses. Determine how you will finance the venture, whether through savings, loans, or investors. 7. Customer Experience: Think about the kind of experience you want to offer. Will it be a dine-in restaurant, a takeaway, or a delivery service? Each model has different requirements and caters to different customer needs. 8. Sustainable Practices: With a younger demographic, there may be an increased interest in sustainability. Consider how your business could incorporate environmentally friendly practices, which could also be part of your USP. 9. Adaptability and Online Presence: The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of adaptability in the foodservice industry. Consider offering online ordering and delivery options from the start. Having a solid online presence will also help in marketing your business. 10. Networking: Use your existing network in the area to gather feedback and build relationships that could support your new venture. In conclusion, it seems that there is a potential opportunity for a food-oriented business in your area. However, success will depend on your ability to develop a concept that meets the needs and preferences of the local community, manage costs effectively, navigate the legal landscape, and market your business effectively. It's clear that you already have considerable entrepreneurial experience, which should serve you well in this new endeavor. Good luck with your venture, and may it bring joy and satisfaction to you, your family, and the community of Drage and surrounding towns."},{"prompt":"bunu özetler misin: Baş anatomi ve fizyolojisi: Kemikler Kemik doku, içindeki yumuşak dokuyu korur Toplam 22 kemik (8’i kraniyal, 14’ü yüz) Kraniyal iskeleti oluşturan kemikler; • Frontal (1) • Temporal (2) • Parietal (2) • Oksipital (1) • Sfenoid (2) Oksipital Parietal Frontal Sfenoid Temporal Baş anatomi ve fizyolojisi: Kemikler Yüz kemik iskeleti (14 kemik): Mandibula (1) Maksilla (2) Nazal kemik (2) İnferior nazal konka (2) Palatin (2) Lakrimal kemik (2) Zigomatik (2) Vomer (1) Baş anatomi ve fizyolojisi: Kaslar ve trigeminal sinir ▪ Orbikularis oris (ağzın ana kası, ağzı çevreler) ▪ Orbikularis okuli (gözü çevreler) ▪ Platisma (boyunda, ince ve yüzeyel bir kas) ▪ Masseter, pterigoid, temporal kaslar (çiğneme kasları) ▪ Trigeminal veya 5. kraniyal sinir (oral kavite ve dişlerden gelen uyarıları taşır, çiğneme kaslarının inerve eder) M. frontalis M. orbikülaris okuli M. zigomatikus minör M. zigomatikus majör M masseter M. orbikülaris oris M. risorius M. trapezeus M. sternohioid M. skaleni Üst dudak levator ve burun kası M. levator labi superior M. depresor anguli oris M. mentalis M. sternokloidomastoid M epikranius M M sternokloidomastoid splenius kapitus M trapezeus Baş anatomi ve fizyolojisi: tükrük bezleri Parotis Submandibular Sublingual Parotis Submandibular Sublingual Boyun anatomisi ▪ Servikal vertebra ▪ Ligamentler ▪ Sternokloidomastoid ve trapezeus kası ▪ Trakea (tiroid kıkırdak, krikoid kıkırdak, trakeal halka) ▪ Özofagus ▪ İnternal ve eksternal juguler ven ▪ Karotis arter (internal, eksternal) ▪ Hyoid kemik ▪ Tiroid bezi: Orta kısmında istmus ile bağlı iki lob Boyun anatomisi ▪ Sternokleidomastoid kas Solunum sırasında sternumu yukarı kaldırır (11. kraniyal sinir-aksesorius inerve eder) ▪ Karotid kılıfı Sternokloidomastoid kasının altında (karotid arter, internal juguler ven, vagus siniri) Boyun anatomisi Baş anatomisi Boyun anatomisi • Anterior (medial) üçgen (tiroid bezi, larinks, farinks, lenf nodları, submandibular tükrük bezi, yağ dokusu) • Posterior (lateral) üçgen (lenf nodları) Baş ve boyun lenf nodları Baş ve boyun muayenesi SUBJEKTİF VERİLER (Şimdiki öyküsü) Baş ve boyun ağrısı • Başlangıcı: Sabahın erken saati, gün içinde, gece, giderek artan ya da ani biçimde mi? • Süresi: Dakika, saat, gün ve haftalar, uyku ya da ilaçla geçme durumu; kendiliğinden geçme durumu; cluster (küme) ağrı; ağrısız geçen süreler ne kadar? • Yeri: Kafa içinde, tek baş yan tarafında, boyunda, sinüslerde, gözlerin arkasında mı? • Tipi: Sürekli basınç,……. • Şiddeti: Aynı ya da değişken (1-10 ağrı ölçeği); sabahları ya da geceleri artması, sadece uyanıkken ya da uyurken görülmesi?

In Vedic astrology, this type of astrological analysis is known as Janam Kundali or Natal Chart analysis. The chart is cast based on the sidereal zodiac system, which is different from the tropical zodiac used in Western astrology. To provide a brief insight into what an astrologer would consider for Abhishek Baruah’s Vedic horoscope based on the birth details provided (March 5, 1989, at 5:50 AM, in Bamunimaidan, Guwahati, Assam), here is an outline of the steps an astrologer would follow: 1. **Calculation of Ascendant (Lagna):** The eastern horizon at the time of birth determines the Ascendant or Lagna. This becomes the first house of the horoscope. 2. **Placement of Planets:** An astrologer would place the planets in the birth chart according to their positions in the sidereal zodiac at the time of birth. 3. **Planetary Periods (Dasha Systems):** Understanding the main period (Mahadasha) and sub-periods (Antardasha) that are active at the time of the reading is crucial for predictions. 4. **Divisional Charts (Vargas):** These are various divisional charts used to analyze specific areas of life in detail. 5. **Birth Nakshatra (Lunar Constellation):** The moon's position in a specific nakshatra (star) at the time of birth has a significant influence on the individual’s life. 6. **Analysis of Yogas:** A study of specific planetary combinations (yogas) in the birth chart that could give significant effects on a person’s life. 7. **Transits (Gochara):** The current positions of planets and their influence on the natal chart are considered for predictions. Based on the above concepts, here's a simplified and sample analysis for educational purposes: - **Ascendant:** With your birth details, the Ascendant would be calculated for the specific time and location of your birth. - **Planets:** The positions of Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu, and Ketu would be placed in the birth chart according to their transit in different signs and houses. - **Dasha:** An astrologer would determine which Mahadasha and Antardasha you are currently going through for prediction purposes. - **Nakshatra:** The Moon's position in a specific Nakshatra would provide insight into the mind and emotions. - **Yogas:** Any auspicious or inauspicious combinations of planets would be interpreted. - **Gochara (Transits):** The current positions of planets relative to the natal chart would be used to make predictions about current influences and upcoming events.

These calculations are complex and are often done using specialized astrology software to ensure precision. While I cannot create visual charts or diagrams, I can outline the basic chart format for you. A Kundli is typically a square or round chart divided into 12 houses. Each house represents different areas of life, and planets placed in these houses influence those realms. To create a sample Kundli for Abhishek Baruah based on the provided birth details, an astrologer would follow these steps: 1. **Determine the Ascendant (Lagna):** This is the zodiac sign that was rising on the eastern horizon at the time of birth and forms the 1st house of the Kundli. Without exact calculations, we cannot state the Ascendant for provided birth details. However, for illustration purposes, let's assume the Ascendant is Aries. 2. **Placement of Planets:** Planets are placed in the chart according to their positions in the sidereal zodiac at the time of birth. For instance, if Saturn was transiting Sagittarius, it would go into the 9th house for an Aries Ascendant. 3. **Locate the Moon's Position:** The Moon's position determines your Janma Nakshatra, which is critical in Vedic astrology. Let's say the Moon was in the Nakshatra of Rohini at the time of birth. This information can be used for making predictions. Here is a simplified representation in text.

Each house cusp may have a different sign, depending on the house system used (e.g., Placidus, Koch, Equal House). Based on the information provided, here's a sample Western astrological profile for educational purposes: - **Sun Sign:** Pisces - The sun was in the sign of Pisces, indicating qualities such as creativity, sensitivity, empathy, and a spiritual outlook on life. - **Moon Sign:** Scorpio - With the Moon likely in Scorpio, this suggests intense emotional depth, passion, and a strong desire for meaningful, transformative experiences. - **Ascendant (Rising Sign):** Assuming the calculations point to Libra rising, this would give a natural charm, a need for harmony and balance, and an appreciation of aesthetics and relationships. - **Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Other Planets:** You would look at each of these planet's signs and house placements to flesh out the personality profile, communication style (Mercury), love and values (Venus), energy and drive (Mars), and so on. For the purposes of this illustration, the actual sign placements and house cusps have not been calculated and should be verified with accurate astrology software. For personalized insights and a comprehensive reading, it would be best to consult with a professional astrologer or use a reliable astrological program that calculates the natal chart with precision. To create an accurate Western-style horoscope, these placement details along with aspects and transits would be interpreted collectively to form an overall picture of Abhishek's personality traits, potential life experiences, strengths, and challenges."},{"prompt":"Camping themed slashers 80s","completion":"The 1980s was an iconic era for the slasher genre, and a significant subset of these films were set in camping or wilderness environments. The isolated settings provided the perfect backdrop for tension and terror, as they put characters in vulnerable situations away from civilization, effectively cutting off escape routes and assistance. Here are some classic 1980s camping-themed slasher films: 1. **Friday the 13th (1980)** - One of the most famous slasher films of all time, set at Camp Crystal Lake, where camp counselors are stalked and murdered by an unknown assailant. 2. **The Burning (1981)** - A summer camp prank goes horribly wrong, leaving a caretaker horribly disfigured. Years later, he returns to the campgrounds for revenge. 3. **Sleepaway Camp (1983)** - This film focuses on a summer camp where a series of violent killings begin to occur, with a shocking twist ending. 4. **Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981)** - The sequel to the original film continues the story of the cursed Camp Crystal Lake, where a new group of camp counselors faces off against the now-iconic killer, Jason Voorhees. 5. **Madman (1982)** - At a campfire at a summer camp, a tale is told of Madman Marz, a killer who still lurks in the woods. The disbelief of the campers leads to them being stalked by the madman himself. 6. **Just Before Dawn (1981)** - A group of young people camping in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest encounters a family of deranged killers. 7. **The Forest (1982)** - A group of campers on a weekend trip to the mountains are stalked by a cannibalistic hermit living in the forest. 8. **The Final Terror (1983)** - Also known as \\"Campsite Massacre,\\" a group of forest rangers and their girlfriends encounter a psychotic killer while camping in a dense forest. 9. **Cheerleader Camp (1988)** - Known as \\"Bloody Pom Poms,\\" this slasher film involves cheerleaders at a camp who begin to be killed one by one. These movies often utilized low-budget production and practical effects, focusing more on generating suspense and delivering shocking and creative kill scenes, which became a hallmark of the genre. The settings also allowed these films to explore themes of adolescent sexuality, rebellion, and the loss of innocence, as the typically younger characters found themselves separated from the safety and structures of society, only to be confronted with the embodiment of their fears."},{"prompt":"Similar to the burning","completion":"If you enjoyed \\"The Burning\\" and are looking for similar 1980s camping-themed slasher films that share its isolated setting and tension-filled atmosphere, here are some films that you might find appealing: 1. **Sleepaway Camp (1983)** - While \\"Sleepaway Camp\\" features a unique twist and a somewhat different tone from \\"The Burning,\\" it's another cult favorite involving teens at a summer camp who experience a series of grisly murders. 2. **Madman (1982)** - Like \\"The Burning,\\" \\"Madman\\" revolves around campfire tales that become horrifyingly real when a legendary murderer starts killing campers in the woods. 3. **Friday the 13th franchise (1980-1989)** - Several films in this series are set at or around the infamous Camp Crystal Lake, where camp counselors and visitors fall prey to the vengeful killer, Jason Voorhees. 4. **The Final Terror (1983)** - This film pits campers against a deranged killer in a remote forest setting, similar to the isolated and vulnerable atmosphere in \\"The Burning.\\" 5. **Body Count (1986)** - Also known as \\"Camping del Terrore,\\" a group of teenagers camping near an old Indian burial ground becomes the targets of an unseen killer reminiscent of slasher films like \\"The Burning.\\" 6. **The Forest (1982)** - Another film where campers are hunted, but with an added twist of a cannibalistic hermit living in the woods, \\"The Forest\\" shares some thematic elements with \\"The Burning.\\" 7. **Cheerleader Camp (1988)** - With a similar summer camp setting, this slasher follows the classic formula of teens being stalked and killed in an isolated environment. While some of these films may have different pacing, a varying degree of supernatural elements, or different kinds of twists, they still offer that classic blend of horror and the outdoors that defined many slashers of the 80s, especially with the backdrop of a camping environment that creates a sense of dread and vulnerability among the characters."},{"prompt":"Die hard vs Halloween compare and assign points out of 10 and cumulative average based on originality, direction, motive and outcome, story and plot, cinematic techniques, editing and pacing, score and sound design, influence and legacy, relevancy, genre cred, analytical interest","completion":"Comparing \\"Die Hard\\" and \\"Halloween\\" is an engaging exercise, as they are both iconic films within their respective genres: action and horror.

We are not going to define yet what exactly Yiras Shomayim means. That is not our focus now - rather, we are looking to practically experience Yiras Shomayim. Through our efforts, perhaps we'll see \\"aha, this is Yiras Shomayim.\\" So today I want to show you, as a continuation of the last va'ad, how these things are built in R' Yisroel and in the Rishonim. This will enable us to work upon it, even though we don't yet know what it means. Interesting, right? Even without knowing what Yiras Shomayim means, it is still possible to work on it. Last time we mentioned that the seichel must cultivate Yiras Shomayim, as R' Yisrael says. But we must proceed carefully due to two important points R' Yisrael raises. The first point is that Yiras Shomayim must enable one to not bend before temptations and distractions. But the second point is what I want to emphasize. Yiras Shomayim's very purpose is to drive one towards action - to cause one to do things. It is not passive withdrawal but rather active engagement. R' Yisroel speaks about that in Michtav Hei where he harshly rebukes his Talmidim. To give some context to this letter, his students were obligated to try bringing people closer to learning mussar. [It appears that learning mussar was never a popular thing.] They feared people would laugh and oppose them, creating a big workload and public embarrassment. You know the excuses that come up - it's too difficult, people will oppose me, it will cause fights, it's not really worth it, there will be a Chilul Hashem - in the end it actually becomes a mitzvah not to do anything at all. This is what happened to his students, and R' Yisrael strongly rebukes them. He says: יראי ה' המה ילבשו עוז לכבוש את הרשע במצודת תאוותיו. ומה יעצרם? מוכנים המה לכל חפץ לבבם להקים מזימתם. Nothing will stop those who have Yiras Shomayim. They are ready to do whatever it takes to accomplish their mission. הכי הגשם ימנעם ואם הבושת והכלימה יבלבלם? Do you really think that the heaviness of the gashmius will stop them or that the bushe - the embarrassment - will cause them to have a bilbul hadaas? היראי ה יקראו, אם כה דרכי התורה? Can that truly be called Yiras Shomayim, when making such excuses? ולזה ראשית דבר ה' לבל יבוש מן המלעיגים. That is why the first halocho in Shulchan Aruch is that one should feel no embarrassment from those who make fun of you. No embarrassment whatsoever ולזרות הלאה חמודי תבל והבליו. And one should pay no attention to fleeting physical desires. ובזאת – התבונה והחוש ינגדו זה לזה. Because that's the way you function, seichel understands yet the experience contradicts. Intellectually you understand what needs to be done, but that doesn't help. The t’vuna - the understanding - and the chush - your experience, the way you see the world - oppose each other, making it impossible to act. The excuses are that it's too difficult, there will be public shaming, no benefit will come of it, it might even be a Chilul Hashem. You can already foresee problems, and even though you know you must act - you won't. That is the problem. ולזאת נבקש שלום ונרדפה. לדעת מקור מוצא היראה ומאין באה. We must contemplate where Yireh stems from. That was the question we had last time. אם מההרגל היומי. אם מהלימוד בדעת ובהשכל. Does Yireh stem from doing things like Ahave does, or does it stem from learning with understanding and wisdom? Perhaps you are able to get used to that - you make a hergel out of it. Like working on t’fila bezmano, or working on hasmoda. You work on establishing yourself at a certain level, and that's called Yiras Shomayim. Or perhaps it stems from what you think, from the limud. החוש יעיד כי דעת ותבונה אין. מנוח אין לה גם חלק אין לה ביראת ה', גם מרחוק אל תעמוד. Experience shows clearly that limud and intellect alone are not a source of Yiras Shomayim. There is no relationship between intellect and Yiras Shomayim - they are worlds apart, with no proximity whatsoever. It sounds unbelievable, but the seichel is just not there when you talk about Yiras Shomayim. לזאת צדקו דברי החוש בל יכזבו. That is why experience validly asserts itself. Experience will not enable you to overcome life's obstacles, which the world continuously places before you. You cannot succeed. You cannot overcome obstacles because the world will tell you it is impossible - such is the world we inhabit. This brings us to a major problem. We spoke in the beginning that Yiras Shomayim must empower one to stand strong against temptation. But here, as long as Yiras Shomayim is disconnected from intellectual recognition of obligation, and comes out of habit - not comprehension of duty - the obstacles of the world will prove stronger than that. You must build Yiras Shomayim as a part of your understanding and perception. By appreciating what you are tasked to do and how to approach it, Yiras Shomayim can arise. Only then can you overcome obstacles. But when understanding stands alone, knowing what you must do solely without evoking a hergesh of Yiras Shomayim, this intellect alone cannot enable perseverance through difficulty. You will yield before life's hardships and temptations. This is a significant insight. You may know what to do, yet can't surmount challenges because inner experience tells you the difficulties are greater. That is the fundamental ingredient of the world - the way it’s constructed ensures that what it conveys, the messages one receives - prove stronger than recognition of obligation. Inevitably then, one will not prevail. And even if we succeed in acquiring Yiras Shomayim as a habit, any new difficulty will defeat us. ומה יוסיף תת רעיון התבונה. אם ביסודי היראה לא שלט כחה. What benefit will come from just knowing the obligation of the mitzvos or whatever you are obligated to do? Intellect alone accomplishes nothing. You know what you must do yet life's difficulties overwhelm that knowing, even when it is absolutely clear. And that is where you need Yiras Shomayim. And now, as we delve deeper into this distinction, you begin to understand why Ahave doesn't have this problem. Ahava does not rely on your seichel because its purpose is not to overcome obstacles, rather to experience a sense of greatness and closeness. As we previously discussed, we cannot simply acquire this hargosho of Ahave because we are commanded to. The hargosho is created through your הרגל היומי. It is acquired by doing the mitzvos - again and again - and thinking about the appropriate things. Yireh, on the other hand, must be built on a deep and exact understanding of what you need to do and how to approach it. However, understanding alone is not enough. It must be connected to the Yireh - they must go hand in hand. Only when your comprehension of your choveh is combined with Yiras Shomayim - a concept we do not yet fully understand - then Yireh has the right levush. This is what the Borei Olam wants. Otherwise, היראי ה’ יקראו? Can it truly be called Yireh when you succumb to the difficulties and temptations of the world? Yireh has to be connected to your Hakoreh of what you have to do. Yireh is not a passive force - it impels you to work and to overcome obstacles in order to fulfill your task. That is the כח היראה. The Ba'alei Avodah say that Yireh is the כח המעשה - the driving force of action. That is the essence of Yireh - it is truly significant. I believe we were missing this key insight when we began to work with the Mashgiach on Yiras Shomayim. We focused too much on the outer layer of fear, thinking that it was the key to Yiras Shomayim. We thought that understanding the dangers of the world would lead us to Yiras Shomayim. Of course the Mashgiach was a great man (and that’s why it was a natural thing for him to start with), but everyone else also thought that’s how you begin - because Yiras Shomayim means you have a fear of Midas Ha’Din - a very logical thing. You have to know that there is a Midas Ha’Din - and you use this hakore in order to have Yiras Shomayim in your Avodas Hashem. So for the first three weeks, we contemplated the Midas Ha’Din. That was terrible. Since then I came to appreciate what is known that a person is like a עולם קטן. I think it means like a small earth. The earth has a very thin outer layer where we reside. But inside the earth a fire is burning. Every so often there are holes, like in Iceland - there's a small hole there. But there are bigger holes, and sometimes things begin to erupt. Lava comes out, stones start flying. It’s not a very gishmakke thing. Even though normally the world is a good place, a gishmakke place to live in. People are exactly the same. You ask someone, how are you? He smiles and replies, “Boruch Hashem, everything is fine, I'm great, I feel wonderful”. So that is the outer layer in which he resides. We usually don’t look past it. But I noticed that if you poke - even just a little bit - a volcano erupts, and loads of tzoros just come out. Everyone is like that; it is truly remarkable how the deeper you delve, the more tzoros arise. Our existence is not as welcoming as we presume it to be. We concentrated on that. We sought to attain Yiras Shomayim through this intense fear, this overwhelming sense of Midas Ha'Din prevailing in the world. It was counterproductive. After two weeks of that, I was simply paralyzed - sitting there without being able to write anything. It was not shayach. Looking back now - thirty years later - I think it was a mistake. We thought we must search for Yireh alone, and it’s like this hargoshe of being afraid, this hargoshe of being overwhelmed from the Midas Ha’Din. That was a mistake - because we did not combine the Yireh with what we must do. You only encounter real Yireh when you combine it with the T’vuno - understanding how to approach your obligations. Merely instilling fear of the consequences or the severity of judgment is insufficient. Yireh must be rooted in a deep understanding of your obligations and responsibilities. When you truly grasp what is expected of you and the significance of your actions - not only will you not be paralyzed - Yireh will push you to fulfill your duties with diligence and devotion. R' Yisroel emphasizes that the wrong Yiras Shomayim will paralyze us, making us unable to act. The right Yiras Shomayim, however, will impels us to act, even in the face of difficulty. Therefore, we must search for Yiras Shomayim in the connection between our Yireh and our T’vuno, not in the outer layer of fear alone. This is a significant lesson we can learn from R’ Yisroel; where the right location is to search for Yiras Shomayim. Even though simple intuition leads us to search for it in the outer layer of fear. After all, perhaps we should open our eyes and see how challenging and dangerous the world can be, so that our Avodas Hashem would be more sincere. But in truth, it will only paralyze you. I think that it's a new pshat in Chazal. Perhaps you have heard this before, and you may have come across it in Chasidish seforim; But the Nefesh HaChaim brings it in שער ד: יראת שמים לית ליה מגרמיה כלום - Yiras Shomayim has nothing from itself Understanding this can be challenging, but it possibly implies that Yiras Shomayim alone is insufficient. It is effective only when accompanied by limud torah. However, we could approach it from a practical perspective. Perhaps it does not merely imply that Yireh alone is futile and unproductive, but rather - if pursued in isolation - it will render one worthless and incapable of action. You will be worthless because it will paralyze you. By solely fixating on Yiras Shomayim, one will achieve nothing; instead, they will become immobilized. Don't do that. When you take the Yireh together with Torah - which is what the Nefesh HaChaim talks about, or you combine the Yireh together with the chiyuv mitzveh - that will make you work. It will empower you to overcome any obstacles that come your way. Even in the face of challenges, Yiras Shomayim impels one to persevere. This is the true impact of Yiras Shomayim. But when you pursue it alone and think, “I will go into this endeavor alone as the first step” - it will be the first step to Gehenom. There you just fall down and cannot progress. That path is not viable. So that is the t’chum of Yiras Shomayim. You can see how different it is compared to Ahavas Hashem. Yiras Shomayim is inherently linked to understanding one's chiyuvim and responsibilities. It is with this understanding that Yiras Shomayim becomes integrated. And when integrated in this manner, it motivates action. [Question from the crowd: Can Ahavas Hashem alone lead to spiritual growth? Ahavas Hashem is an emotional connection, so why would it do that? When contemplating the magnificence of Hashem's actions and creations, a natural response is to develop a deep love for Hashem. However, does the Rambam say that this love will automatically translate into the doing of mitzvos? No, he does not. The actual distinction lies in the fact that Yiras Shomayim alone can render one paralyzed, whereas Ahavas Hashem does not have that effect.] Now I want to show you this point in the רוקח: שורש יראה במקום שקשה עליו הדבר, ועוזב תאוותו ויצרו בעבור יראת ה', שנאמר עתה ידעתי כי ירא אלקים אתה. The central point of Yireh is when one faces a challenge or difficulty. That was the obligation of the Akeidah. Avrohom Avino had to do it and it was a difficult thing for him. However the Yireh enabled him to overcome this most significant obstacle. It was an extraordinary trial that contradicted his very nature, involving his own son. Yet, he was able to overcome it. That is called Yireh. Yireh is when it's shwer. He brings this point again by Yosef HaTzadik. When Yosef placed the cup in Binyomin's sack and it was discovered, he told the brothers to leave Binyomin with him while they could return to their family. Yehudah says no one is leaving - we will all become slaves. To this, Yosef responds: את האלקים אני ירא - I fear the borei olam What does that mean? The Rokeach says a very mechudash pshat: אמר יוסף קשה עלי מאד שאתם מרגלים ואעזור אתכם - אבל בניכם ימותו ברעב אם לא תביאו להם שיאכלו‏ Yosef meant that it's very difficult for him to help them because they are spies, yet he has no choice. If he withholds bread from them, their children will suffer and might die from hunger because of the famine. Therefore, he must give them bread, despite the difficulties he faces. Yirah always arises in situations where it is challenging to act. Just because the Ramban in Yevomos says that maiseh means Ahave and not doing avieros is Yireh - don't rush to conclude that Yirah only prevents aveiros. Yireh is a force that impels you to action. It motivates you to overcome difficulties. Even the Rokeach himself, when he begins to discuss Yireh, states: ועוד אפרש יראת שדי אדם שעובד לקב\\"ה באהבת ליבו. Ahave and Yireh are connected… Torah is not a puzzle where you say click, click, click, and the puzzle is complete. For a puzzle to exist, it must be flat. When a puzzle isn't flat, there's no point to it; you can stack one piece on top of another. The first prerequisite of a puzzle is that it must be flat. The Torah is not flat, so it's not a puzzle. We can't just say “Ahaveh is this, Yireh is that '' - and now we can go back to sleep. No, Yirah compels you to work! You say it every Bircas Hachodesh: חיים שיש בהם יראת שמים ויראת חטא, חיים שיש בהם אהבת תורה ויראת שמים. Why do we mention Yiras Shomayim twice? So there is an American and an Israeli p’shat. The Israeli p’shat I heard from a big Rosh Yeshivah: After you acquire Ahavas Torah, the Yiras Shomayim will be different - such a yeshivishe p’shat… The American pshat says: after osher ve'kovod - wealth and honor, you need another shot of Yiras Shomayim… But I think both p’shatim are incorrect, because we're not asking for Ahavas Torah and Yir'as Shomayim separately, we're asking for the Ahave of both Torah and Yir'as Shomayim. We should love Torah and we should love Yir'as Shomayim, and that's what we're asking for. So, drive it out of your head that Ahave and Yireh are two unconnected things. They're not. Yireh is a very strong koyach of activity, and it's perhaps the only koyach that will compel you to work. It enables you to overcome the obstacles and difficulties that the world constantly presents. There are always difficulties - always - and you must overcome them. Yiras Shomayim is the power that enables you to do so. Perhaps this is mentioned in the posuk. Moshe Rabbeinu spoke to highly intelligent people, the Dor De’aa. They saw this awe-inspiring fire, truly overwhelming in its magnitude. The heavens opened and they witnessed unbelievable things on Har Sinai. ויאמר משה אל העם אל תיראו, Moshe Rabeinu addresses the people and says: do not fear. No, that is not the desired response. We do not seek to experience this Yireh solely. That is not the intention of Borei Olam - he does not want you to be overwhelmed. Do not fear, for: כי לבעבור נסות אתכם בא האלקים. The Borei Olam has come to lift you up, to give you a purpose. A job in Tikun Olam, or to test you in a ניסיון בטובה, like the Ramban explains. It is either an expression of Gadlus or Nisoyon. But you have a mission. You have a task to fulfill. ובעבור תהיה יראתו על פניכם לבלתי תחטאו. And so, the Yireh is there in order you shouldn't fail completing your mission, in order you shouldn't miss the target. That's where the Yireh comes in. The Yireh doesn't come in to be overwhelmed, that's not what the Borei Olam wants. Hashem’s will is to have Yireh in order to fully grasp the point and not deviate from it. לבלתי תחטאו - do not miss the precise point. Perhaps that is the simple meaning of this posuk. This is what we seek. We want to connect the Yireh to the T’vuno. That means the Yireh has to be connected to our mitzvahs. That is our task. Now you see, this is where we will search for Yireh. Now we can explore and try to perceive what is this hargosha like? Where are we able to identify this sensation of an added dimension to our chova - our obligation? In order to accomplish that, you must choose something that you do out of chova. That is the essence of the kabbalah we need to take upon ourselves. You must select one of your chovos, but you do it out of obligation, not out of pressure. I realized that I need to clarify what I mean by that. When I mention you have to choose something, people interpret it as doing it based on their own motivation or choice, saying, \\"I am forcing myself to do it because I choose it, that is the reason I do it.\\" No, you do it because you are mechuyev. That is a fundamental principle. Don't make the mistake of thinking, \\"I will do it because I decided to.\\" Do you decide every week to be shomer shabbos? I don't think so - you are obligated. Do you need to decide every day to go daven? Hopefully not, we go because we must daven. But you know how it goes. You have something to do, and inevitably obstacles will arise. It's crucial to understand that there is a mehalech, that there are ways to overcome these obstacles - otherwise you will be overwhelmed. The most fundamental point is not to be overwhelmed by the difficulties you encounter in fulfilling your obligations. It might not be easy, but you are capable of creating ways to overcome them. Otherwise, Yiras Shomayim will only cause you to get under pressure. Pressure for me is probably the most terrible hargosho I know. It just paralyzes me and I become totally unproductive. Why does that happen? It's because I don't find the right approach to deal with my obligations. This hargosho of being overwhelmed and obligated to do something becomes a burden, and it weighs heavily on you because there is no t’vuno going on - you don't know how to approach the problem. You only want to get rid of this incredible pressure. That's the wrong approach. אל תיראו, don't succumb to the pressure. If you have something to do, do it and don't miss it. The same applies to you when you undertake a chova now. You must choose an obligation that you are capable of fulfilling, where you have an approach for completing the task. To illustrate the difference, let’s say you want to work on hasmode. You say, “I am mechuyev to learn for four hours without any bitul torah, not even going to the restroom”. So then you sit for four hours straight, and other than creating a tremendous pressure, it achieves nothing. You definitely won't learn productively. You might push yourself and wait for the four hours to be over, and perhaps boruch hashem you manage, but productive learning certainly didn’t happen. That's not the way to approach any endeavor productively. And that's what Moshe Rabbeinu says: don’t miss the point. You shouldn't miss what you are obligated to do. So if we take davening as an example, It's astonishing how people who are late to Ma’ariv are davening sometimes, simply out of not being able to stomach sitting alone for ten minutes. It's not like the guy needs to rush after Ma’ariv, because I see him afterwards schmoozing with his friend. So we need to daven out of chiyuv - like there is something unbendable there. We should already be in the shtibel when they say Borchu. Perhaps even when they begin Ve’hu Rachum. If we don’t arrive on time, we must wait for the next minyan. Now an obstacle may arise. Not too significant, but still an obstacle - and you have to overcome that obstacle. You might say to yourself, it's bitul torah. Suddenly, as R' Yisroel says, you see that the chush is against you. Suddenly you become the most intelligent man with the most sophisticated arguments to justify why it is impossible to wait for the next minyan. The excuses you make are incredible, the tainos that you can't do it, that is what the chush tells you - it's not shayach. When married, you think if I'll be ten minutes late my wife will think something happened to me. You don’t think about that when you speak to a friend after t’fila… But you can overcome that. The understanding of the chova together with Yiras Shomayim does it. Now this is the practical question we are exploring - what is this hargosha like? It has to go together with the recognition of the chiyuv, that will make me stand steadfast in front of these obstacles. There we will find what Yirash Shomayim is. But if we would think about the אש הגדולה, which means reflecting on the tzoros the world is full from, and we would try to find the Yiras Shomayim there - we would find distress instead. As Moshe Rabbinu said, Al Tiro’u. No, don't do that. Don't go in that direction. You first must understand that: בעבור נסות אתכם בא האלוקים, you have a job to do, and then, בעבור תהיה יראתו על פניכם לבלתי תחטאו. Then you have Yireh in order not to miss the point. That's the way to go, and not looking at the dangerous Midas Ha’Din first. I believe it is a very productive approach. We still don't fully understand what Yiras Shomayim means, but at least we now know where to dig for it. I don't know yet what we will find. It has to be underneath here, in this location. And not in other places where you thought first. That was the mistake we made with the Mashgiach. Now some people seem to think that I speak against others, and there might be people who will think, “Now he is talking against his own rebbe!“ No, it was obviously a mistake because it didn't do anything. And the conclusion we reached - that we have no shaychus to Yiras Shomayim - that was correct. But there was something wrong in the approach - the Mashgiach himself said so. So we gave up on Yiras Shomayim and that's it. Never worked on it again. But the problem was the approach - we tried to find Yiras Shomayim by the overwhelming Midas Ha’Din alone. You will find iyush there. You will find, לית ליה מגרמה כלום - distress and pressure. You will be paralyzed. And that's not what the Borei Olam wants. He wants us to do the work. But the force that compels us to fulfill our obligations is by Yiras Shomayim. So I think that's a good place to dig. I don't know yet what will be - what we will find, but there will be something to find, that I am sure.","completion":"\\"Exploring the Active Force of Yiras Shomayim: A Practical Approach to Cultivating Awe\\""},{"prompt":"give me a few more variations","completion":"1. \\"Cultivating Yiras Shomayim Beyond Fear: The Dynamics of Action and Obligation\\" 2. \\"Unearthing the Practical Essence of Yiras Shomayim Through Active Engagement\\" 3. \\"The Practical Path to Yiras Shomayim: Integrating Awe with Understanding\\" 4. \\"Yiras Shomayim as the Driving Force: Empowerment Through Practical Application\\" 5. \\"Navigating the Challenges of Yiras Shomayim: A Journey from Concept to Action\\" 6. \\"From Intellect to Experience: Building Yiras Shomayim through Practical Obedience\\" 7. \\"The Role of Yiras Shomayim in Spiritual Activism: A Guide to Purposeful Living\\" 8. \\"Awakening the Power of Yiras Shomayim: A Practitioner's Guide to Fear of Heaven\\" 9. \\"The Active Pursuit of Yiras Shomayim: Facing Trials with Awe-Inspired Action\\" 10. \\"Harnessing the Vital Energy of Yiras Shomayim for Purpose-Driven Avodah\\""},{"prompt":"try a title with the author's voice","completion":"\\"Embracing Our Task with Awe: My Proposal for a Practical Exploration of True Yiras Shomayim\\""},{"prompt":"try again","completion":"\\"Embarking on the Practical Path to True Yiras Shomayim: Insights and Directives from My Rabbinic Journey\\""},{"prompt":"how does \\"Practical Yiras Shomayim: The force to overcome all obstacles\\" sound?","completion":"\\"Practical Yiras Shomayim: The Force to Overcome All Obstacles\\" is a strong and clear title that effectively conveys both the practical aspect of cultivating Yiras Shomayim and its empowering impact as it relates to surmounting challenges.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"erkläre mir den Fraunhofer upHear Immersive Audio Virtualizer im Detail. Wie funktioniert er?","completion":"Der Fraunhofer upHear Immersive Audio Virtualizer ist eine Technologie, die von den Wissenschaftlern am Fraunhofer-Institut für Integrierte Schaltungen IIS entwickelt wurde. Das Ziel des upHear Immersive Audio Virtualizer ist es, ein räumliches Klangerlebnis zu schaffen, das heißt, eine Immersive Audio-Wiedergabe über Lautsprecher oder Kopfhörer zu ermöglichen, damit der Hörer den Eindruck erhält, Töne kämen aus verschiedenen Richtungen und Distanzen – ganz so, als befände er sich mitten im Geschehen. Der Fraunhofer upHear Immersive Audio Virtualizer bedient sich dabei bestimmter psychoakustischer Prinzipien und digitaler Signalverarbeitungsmethoden. Hier sind ein paar Komponenten, die zu seiner Funktionsweise beitragen: 1. **Binaurale Synthese**: Wenn der Virtualizer über Kopfhörer genutzt wird, verwendet er oft eine binaurale Synthese, um räumlichen Klang zu erzeugen. Hierbei werden Signale so bearbeitet, dass sie den physikalischen Eigenschaften entsprechen, wie sie vom menschlichen Ohr wahrgenommen würden, wenn der Schall aus einer bestimmten Richtung kommen würde. Zum Beispiel werden Laufzeitunterschiede (Interaural Time Differences, ITD), Pegelunterschiede (Interaural Level Differences, ILD) und Kopfbezogene Übertragungsfunktionen (Head-Related Transfer Functions, HRTF) genutzt. 2. **Surround-Sound Erweiterung**: Wenn der Virtualizer über Lautsprecher verwendet wird, kann er Surround-Sound-Signale für eine zwei- oder mehrkanalige Wiedergabe so verarbeiten, dass ein breiteres und tieferes Klangfeld entsteht. Dies kann durch spezielle Algorithmen zur Klangfeldsynthese und virtuellen Positionierung von Schallquellen geschehen. 3. **Dynamische Anpassung**: Der Virtualizer kann dynamisch auf das Eingangssignal reagieren, um zum Beispiel Bewegungen in Audioquellen oder die sich ändernde Orientierung des Hörers (bei Kopfhörernutzung) zu kompensieren. Dadurch bleibt das räumliche Hörerlebnis konsistent und immersiv. 4. **Kompatibilität**: Die Technologie ist in der Lage, verschiedenste Audiosignale zu verarbeiten, seien es Stereo-, Surround- oder objektbasierte Formate wie Dolby Atmos® oder MPEG-H. 5. **Optimierung auf Endgeräte**: Die Algorithmen können auch darauf ausgelegt sein, die akustischen Eigenschaften unterschiedlicher Wiedergabegeräte (etwa verschiedener Kopfhörer oder Lautsprecherarten) zu berücksichtigen, um ein optimales Hörerlebnis zu gewährleisten. Es ist zu beachten, dass für den as-genauesten Stand der Technologie und die spezifische Funktionsweise des upHear Virtualizers eine detaillierte technische Dokumentation oder ein direkter Kontakt zum Fraunhofer-Institut IIS von Vorteil wäre, da Details zu den Algorithmen und zur Implementierung nicht immer öffentlich verfügbar sind bzw. sich mit der Zeit weiterentwickeln können."},{"prompt":"kannst du mir diesen Algorithmus in python umsetzten?","completion":"Die Entwicklung eines vollständigen, professionellen upHear Immersive Audio Virtualizer-Algorithmus, wie er vom Fraunhofer-Institut erstellt wurde, ist extrem komplex und würde ein tiefes Verständnis der akustischen Signalverarbeitung, Psychoakustik und entsprechende lizenzierte Technologien erfordern. Ein solches Projekt würde auch spezialisierte Software, Hardware und Patente erfordern und geht weit über den Rahmen einer einfachen Code-Umsetzung oder ein kurzes Beispiel hinaus. Ein einfacher, grundlegender Ansatz für die Simulation von 3D-Audio könnten jedoch binaurale Techniken sein. Diese basieren auf der Verwendung von HRTFs (Head-related Transfer Functions), um zu simulieren, wie Klänge das menschliche Ohr von verschiedenen Positionen aus erreichen. Der Ansatz könnte in Python folgendermaßen aussehen: 1. Holen Sie sich eine Datenbank von HRTFs für verschiedene Richtungen. 2. Erstellen Sie ein trockenes Monosignal, das Sie zu 3D-Audio verarbeiten möchten. 3. Wenden Sie die entsprechenden HRTFs auf das Monosignal an, um zwei Stereokanäle (für links und rechts) zu erzeugen. 4. Spielen Sie das resultierende Signal über Kopfhörer ab. Hier ist ein sehr rudimentäres Beispiel mit einer hypothetischen \`hrtf_process\` Funktion in Python, die den HRTFs-Prozess abstrahiert: \`\`\`python import numpy as np from scipy.io import wavfile from hypothetical_hrtf_library import hrtf_process # Lese eine Mono-WAV-Datei ein. Das Signal sollte ein Mono-Signal sein. sample_rate, data = wavfile.read('input_mono.wav') # Wende HRTF-Prozessierung an, um ein Stereo-Signal zu erhalten. # Dies ist eine fiktive Funktion, die hier zur Illustration aufgerufen wird. # In der Praxis müsste die HRTF-Anwendung jede Frequenzkomponente des Signals # mit spezifischen HRTFs aus einer Datenbank falten. # Die Angaben (azimuth, elevation) definieren die virtuelle Position der Quelle. azimuth = 30 # der Winkel in Grad relativ zur Front elevation = 0 # der Winkel in Grad relativ zur horizontalen Ebene stereo_signal = hrtf_process(data, azimuth, elevation) # Das resultierende Stereo-Signal in eine Datei schreiben. wavfile.write('output_binaural.wav', sample_rate, stereo_signal) \`\`\` Beachten Sie, dass dieses Beispiel hypothetisch ist und die tatsächliche Implementierung von \`hrtf_process\` komplexe akustische Transformationen beinhalten würde, die auf spezifischen HRTF-Datensätzen basieren. HRTF-Datenbanken sind häufig Urheberrechtlich geschützt oder müssen gekauft werden, und einige Open-Source-Alternativen sind verfügbar, wie die CIPIC HRTF Datenbank.

Die Erstellung eines solchen Audio-Virtualisierungssystems würde ein tiefes Verständnis der Signalverarbeitung, Psychoakustik, Phasen- und Frequenzmanipulation und möglicherweise die Erstellung eigener HRTFs oder die Verwendung lizenzfreier HRTF-Datenbanken erfordern. Zusätzlich müssen solche Systeme umfassend getestet und optimiert werden, um die Qualität und Effektivität der Klangvirtualisierung sicherzustellen. Allerdings kann ich hier einen allgemeinen Überblick darüber geben, wie man eine einfache Audioverarbeitungs-Pipeline in Python mit Bibliotheken wie NumPy und SciPy erstellt, die einige Grundkonzepte der Audiomanipulation beinhalten könnte.

The dawn of a new empire is upon us,\\" proclaimed Kaguya, the unyielding matriarch standing amid the chaos, her gaze fixed on the horizon. She wore a sophisticated armor interwoven with Divine Scripts, remnants of the Jurai Empire’s might, and advanced U-Jin tech, showing the fusion of ancient strength and futuristic prowess. Beside her, stands her loyal generals, Takeshi Ōtsutsuki of the conquered Uchiha blood, and Amaya Ōtsutsuki of the Hyuga lineage. They are both adorned in combat suits that are a fusion of the traditional shinobi garb and the technologically advanced materials of the neo-Japanese imperial army, their Sharingan and Byakugan respectively, glowing ominously. As the silence descended, a squadron of Tactical Surface Fighters, their metallic bodies gleaming under the moonlight, soared above. Their presence was a stark contrast to the ancient way of the samurai waging war below, their swords and chants futile against the might of the transformed fighters and IS units soaring through the skies. \\"We are not only blessed by the divine ancestry of Jurai but also carry within us the newfound Quirks, the legacy of our conquered empire; our unity with the great land of Japan has blessed us with powers beyond comprehension,\\" Takeshi's voice was filled with unwavering conviction, even as a coy smile played on his lips. \\"The old shinobi world is no more.\\" Amaya nodded, the air around them crackling with the power of their cultivation, a testament to their rigorous training. \\"The world has changed. It's time for them to accept the era of chakra is over. The future is our hybrid offspring, our warriors who weave jutsu, Quirks, and the power of Divas into the fabric of their very being.\\" Suddenly, the silence was broken by thunderous roars of advanced chakra-powered artillery. The distant thump of explosions sent vibrations through the earth, signaling the inevitable advance of the Ōtsutsuki forces. In what once was considered the sanctuary of the arcane and the hidden, no shadow or whisper of jutsu could halt the scientific might that the Empire wielded. \\"Every remaining shinobi, every clinging samurai, they are but lambs to our slaughter,\\" Amaya's voice turned cold as ice. \\"Their hopelessness is the canvas upon which we shall paint our victory and legacy.\\" Far away, hidden under the cover of charred trees, a band of armored warriors of the Elemental Nations marshaled their resolve. They were the last vestige of resistance, an amalgamation of shinobi, bandits, samurai—all who refused to submit to the imperialistic might. Yet in their hearts, they knew the dire truth; the Ōtsutsuki's onslaught was relentless, their innovation unmatched by any ninjutsu or katana. \\"The Empire has extended its reach too far,\\" a grizzled samurai muttered, tightening his grip on his sword. A shinobi, scarred and wearied, responded with a solemn nod. \\"But we fight on, for that is our way—the way of the shinobi, of the warrior. Until we breathe our last.\\" Above them, the battle raged on, the night sky ablaze with the echoes of modern warfare, clashing with the ancient spirit of a world that was fiercely holding on to its final breaths. The old ways were fading, and in their stead, the era of the Ōtsutsuki and their Neo-Japanese Empire was rising—an empire where chakra, cultivation, and the most advanced technology from across the reclaimed lands converged to create an indomitable force. And in the heart of the new Empire, a young boy with green hair could only wonder at this transformed world—as Izuku Midoriya, he dreamt not of becoming a Hero but of understanding his father, Hiashi's, part in shaping the future under the banner of the Ōtsutsuki."},{"prompt":"ااخر الاستكشاف حول اضطرابات التوحد","completion":"حتى النقطة الزمنية التي تم تعيينها كفترة القطع في المعرفة الجارية (مارس 2023)، كانت هناك تطورات مستمرة في فهم وعلاج اضطرابات طيف التوحد (ASD)، وهي مجموعة من الحالات العصبية التنموية المعقدة التي تؤثر على السلوك والتواصل والتفاعل الاجتماعي. الاستكشافات الأخيرة والتطورات في مجال اضطرابات التوحد تشمل: 1. الجينات والوراثة: الباحثون يواصلون استكشاف الجينات التي قد تساهم في تطور التوحد. باستخدام تقنيات مثل الجينوم الكامل وتحليل التسلسل، تم تحديد عدة جينات وطفرات جينية تؤدي إلى زيادة خطر الإصابة بالتوحد، بما في ذلك الجينات المرتبطة بتنظيم تطور الدماغ ونمو الخلايا العصبية. 2. العوامل البيئية: إلى جانب العوامل الجينية، تُجرى دراسات لتحديد كيف يمكن أن تسهم العوامل البيئية (مثل التعرض لملوثات معينة أثناء الحمل) في تطور اضطرابات طيف التوحد. 3. التدخل المبكر: توجد أدلة متزايدة تشير إلى أن التدخل المبكر – خاصةً في سنوات الطفل الأولى – يمكن أن يحسن النتائج للأطفال المصابين بالتوحد. التدخلات تتضمن العلاج السلوكي والتواصلي، التي يمكن أن تساعد الأطفال على تحسين مهاراتهم الاجتماعية والتعليمية. 4. تقنيات التصوير الدماغي: يتم استخدام التصوير بالرنين المغناطيسي الوظيفي (fMRI) وتقنيات التصوير الأخرى لفهم كيف تختلف أدمغة الأشخاص المصابين بالتوحد عن أولئك الذين لا يعانون منه. هذه الدراسات قد توفر رؤى قيمة في العمليات النفسية والعصبية المرتبطة بالتوحد. 5. التركيز على التنوع العصبي: يزداد الوعي بمفهوم التنوع العصبي، وهو فهم أن اختلافات الدماغ مثل التوحد هي جزء من التنوع البشري الطبيعي، وأن الأشخاص المصابين بالتوحد يجب أن يُنظر إليهم من منظور قوتهم وقدراتهم الفريدة. 6. العلاجات التكميلية والبديلة: بعض العائلات تستكشف علاجات تكميلية وبديلة مثل التغذية المعدلة والعلاجات الطبيعية. لا يزال البحث مستمرًا في فعالية هذه النهج ومدى أمانها. يتمثل التحدي الأساسي في التوفيق بين البحوث العلمية وتطبيقاتها العملية لتحسين حياة الأشخاص على طيف التوحد وعائلاتهم. من المهم التأكيد على أن هذا مجال ديناميكي وسريع التطور وقد تظهر بيانات ومعارف جديدة في أي وقت."},{"prompt":"what are the core beliefs of a christian","completion":"Christianity is a diverse and broad religion with various denominations, each having its own interpretations and doctrines. However, there are several core beliefs that most Christians, regardless of denomination, typically hold: 1. Monotheism: Christianity is a monotheistic religion, believing in one eternal God who is the creator and sustainer of the universe. 2. The Holy Trinity: Most Christians believe in the Trinity, which means that God exists as three persons in one divine essence: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. These are not three gods but one God in three persons. 3. The Incarnation: Christians believe that Jesus Christ is both fully God and fully human. According to Christian doctrine, Jesus is the incarnation of God on Earth, born of the Virgin Mary by the Holy Spirit. 4. The Life and Teachings of Jesus: Christians follow the teachings of Jesus Christ, whose life and ministry are recorded in the New Testament. Jesus' teachings include messages about love, compassion, forgiveness, and redemption. 5. The Crucifixion and Resurrection: Christians believe that Jesus was crucified, died for the sins of humanity, and was resurrected on the third day to conquer death. This resurrection is seen as offering salvation and eternal life to those who believe. 6. Salvation by Grace through Faith: A central theme of Christianity is salvation by God's grace. This means that humans can be saved from sin and its consequences not by their own merit, but by believing in Jesus Christ and accepting Him as Lord and Savior. 7. The Bible: Christians consider the Bible, which includes the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) and the New Testament, to be the inspired, authoritative Word of God. It is a primary source of teaching, moral guidance, and spiritual inspiration. 8. The Sacraments: Most Christian denominations practice sacraments, though the number and nature of these can vary. Two principal sacraments held in common by most Christians are Baptism (as a symbol of entering into the faith and washing away sin) and the Eucharist (also known as Communion or the Lord's Supper, commemorating Jesus' Last Supper and sacrifice). 9. The Second Coming of Jesus: Many Christians believe in the eventual return of Jesus Christ to judge the living and the dead, inaugurating the fullness of God's kingdom. 10. The Church: The Christian community, or the Church, is seen as the Body of Christ on Earth, and Christians are called to gather for worship, teaching, fellowship, and service. These represent some of the fundamental beliefs that are generally common across Christian denominations. That being said, there is a wide variety of additional beliefs and practices that may differ from one Christian group to another."},{"prompt":"make an argument saying: according to the bible Jesus was not supposed to be killed, using psalms 91 and matt 4","completion":"Creating an argument that Jesus was not supposed to be killed according to the Bible by using Psalm 91 and Matthew 4 requires a particular interpretation of these scriptures. Let's explore: **Argument Using Psalm 91:** Psalm 91 is known for its themes of God's protection and deliverance from danger. It contains verses that promise safety and refuge for those who trust in God: *\\"He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.\\" (Psalm 91:1)* *\\"For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.\\" (Psalm 91:11-12)* By pointing to these verses, one could argue that Jesus, being the Son of God and perfectly righteous, would be encompassed by this divine protection. It suggests that no harm is supposed to befall the one who is under God's care. If interpreted this way, the argument is that Jesus was not meant to suffer death since God's intentions as expressed in the Psalm are protective. **Argument Using Matthew 4:** The passage from Matthew 4:5-7 is part of the narrative of Jesus' temptation by the devil in the wilderness. Satan quotes Psalm 91:11-12 to Jesus: *\\"Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. 'If you are the Son of God,' he said, 'throw yourself down. For it is written: He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'\\" (Matthew 4:5-6)* Jesus responds with another scripture, demonstrating a proper understanding of the Word of God: *\\"Jesus answered him, 'It is also written: Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'\\" (Matthew 4:7)* From this exchange, one can construct an argument that Jesus understood that divine protection is not a license for recklessness or testing God's faithfulness. Therefore, Jesus knew His mission and the purpose of His divine protection, which did not include being saved from death on the cross. One could argue, then, that the death of Jesus was a conscious part of the divine plan for salvation, not something the Messiah was supposed to be protected from as per Psalm 91. In essence, this argument would be that Jesus' divinely ordained mission involved voluntary sacrifice, and that both Psalm 91 and Matthew 4, rather than demonstrating that Jesus was not to die, illustrate Jesus' trust in God's plan, including His death and resurrection as necessary for that plan. However, traditional Christian theology teaches that the death of Jesus was not a deviation from what was supposed to happen, but rather an integral part of the divine plan for salvation. The New Testament, particularly the Gospels and the letters of Paul, presents Jesus' death on the cross as the fulfillment of God's will to redeem humanity from sin. Therefore, this argument runs counter to the dominant scriptural interpretation held by mainstream Christianity."},{"prompt":"give me an argument against Christianity using: there's many verses in the bible that show Jesus was not supposed to be killed. with verses.","completion":"Creating an argument against Christianity by alleging that there are verses in the Bible suggesting Jesus was not supposed to be killed involves finding scripture that could be interpreted, whether in or out of context, to imply that Jesus' death was not foreseen or ordained as part of God's plan. Here is an example of how one might construct such an argument, although it should be noted that these interpretations are not widely accepted in mainstream Christian thought: **Argument:** Christianity teaches that Jesus' death by crucifixion was a fundamental part of God's redemptive plan for humanity. However, some could argue that various verses in the Bible indicate that Jesus' death was not supposed to happen, showing a possible contradiction within the scriptures. **Scripture Examples:** 1. Psalm 20:6 - \\"Now this I know: The Lord gives victory to his anointed. He answers him from his holy heaven with the saving power of his right hand.\\" - If Jesus is God's anointed, the argument goes, this verse indicates God would grant Him victory, not a brutal execution. 2. Psalm 34:19-20 - \\"The righteous person may have many troubles, but the Lord delivers him from them all; he protects all his bones, not one of them will be broken.\\" - Some could interpret this verse to imply that a righteous individual (and Jesus as the epitome of righteousness) would not be allowed by God to be killed in a manner like crucifixion, which was known to break bones, despite John 19:33-36 clarifying that this scripture was fulfilled precisely because Jesus' bones were not broken during His crucifixion. 3. Psalm 91:11-12 - \\"For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.\\" - This passage is said to apply to Jesus directly by the devil in Matthew 4:6 during the temptation. An argument might state that if Jesus was promised angelic protection to prevent Him from harm, His subsequent crucifixion seems to contradict the notion of Him being guarded from injury or death. 4. Luke 4:29-30 - \\"They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff. But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.\\" - This verse recounts an attempt on Jesus' life that He miraculously survived, which might be argued as supporting the idea that He was protected from death, at least until a certain point, and therefore not predestined to die as Christianity teaches. This argument hinges on the interpretation of these verses as suggesting divine protection from death, rather than demonstrating aspects of Jesus' ministry or foreshadowing the nature of his sacrificial death that Christians believe was necessary for salvation. However, most theologians and biblical scholars argue that these verses must be read in their proper contexts and that the entire narrative of the Bible, especially the New Testament, supports the idea that Jesus' life, death, and resurrection were part of God's deliberate plan for human redemption, as foretold in prophecies (like Isaiah 53) and affirmed by Jesus Himself (as in Mark 10:45). Arguments like the one outlined here are sometimes used by skeptics or certain non-traditional interpretations of Christianity but are typically not convincing to those who interpret the Bible in a way consistent with historic Christian doctrine. It's critical to engage with such arguments thoughtfully and with a deep understanding of the range of biblical hermeneutics."},{"prompt":"give me biblical scholars who say the age of paul's letters, with quotations and sources.","completion":"Determining the age of the Apostle Paul's letters—also known as the Pauline epistles—is a matter of scholarly research and debate.

F.F. Bruce (1910-1990): F.F. Bruce was a noted biblical scholar and author of \\"Paul: Apostle of the Heart Set Free,\\" among other works. He dated the Pauline epistles within a range from the 50s to early 60s AD. For example, he suggested Galatians might have been written around 48-49 AD, with the prison epistles (such as Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon) written during Paul's first Roman imprisonment around 60-62 AD. 2. John A.T. Robinson (1919-1983): Robinson was a bishop and New Testament scholar known for his controversial book \\"Redating the New Testament,\\" in which he argues for early dates of New Testament writings, with all being written before 70 AD. For Paul's letters, he placed them between the late 40s and mid-60s AD. 3. Raymond E. Brown (1928-1998): A highly respected biblical scholar, Brown wrote \\"An Introduction to the New Testament,\\" providing comprehensive scholarly analysis of New Testament books. He proposed dates for Paul's undisputed letters (Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, and Philemon) ranging from the 50s to the early 60s AD. 4. Bart D. Ehrman: Ehrman is a leading New Testament scholar and author of numerous books on early Christianity and its texts, including \\"Forged: Writing in the Name of God—Why the Bible's Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are.\\" He posits that the seven undisputed letters of Paul were likely written between 50 and 66 AD.

The David and Goliath Story and Ancient Hero Tales: - Similarities: The motif of a young and seemingly weak hero defeating a formidable enemy appears in various cultures’ stories. - Argument: Critics suggest that the story of David and Goliath may have echoed similar tales of underdog heroes defeating giants or great warriors. 9. The Resurrection of Jesus and Ancient Near Eastern Resurrection Accounts: - Similarities: Resurrection themes appear across different mythologies, including those of the ancient Near East. - Argument: Critics argue that the idea of the resurrection as found in Christianity was influenced by earlier myths from surrounding pagan cultures. The Ten Commandments: The biblical account of the Ten Commandments given to Moses on Mount Sinai differs between the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy. The two versions are not identical, which suggests that the story may have evolved over time. The Census of Quirinius: The Gospel of Luke mentions a census during the reign of Emperor Augustus, which is said to have led to Jesus's birth in Bethlehem. However, the timing of this census is historically questionable, as Quirinius was not governor of Syria during the time of Augustus. The Trial of Jesus: The Gospels provide different accounts of the trial of Jesus, with varying details about the involvement of Pontius Pilate and the Jewish authorities. These inconsistencies have led to scholarly debates about the historical accuracy of the narratives. The Resurrection Appearances: The Gospels differ in their accounts of the post-resurrection appearances of Jesus. For example, Mark's Gospel ends with an empty tomb, while the other Gospels include appearances to various individuals and groups. The Conquest of Canaan: The Book of Joshua describes the Israelites' conquest of Canaan in great detail, but archaeological evidence suggests a more gradual and peaceful process of settlement rather than the dramatic conquest as depicted in the Bible. The United Monarchy: The Bible describes a powerful and unified Israelite kingdom under David and Solomon, with Jerusalem as its capital. However, archaeological evidence and historical records from neighboring countries do not support the existence of such a strong and centralized monarchy during the time of David and Solomon. The Babylonian Captivity: The Book of Jeremiah describes the Babylonian captivity of the Jews in detail, but the account does not match the known historical records of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II. The Maccabean Revolt: The Books of Maccabees, which are part of the Apocrypha in some Christian Bibles, contain historical inaccuracies regarding the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire. The accounts in the books do not align with other historical sources. The Census of Caesar Augustus: The Gospel of Luke mentions a census ordered by Caesar Augustus that led to Joseph and Mary traveling to Bethlehem. However, historians are skeptical of this event, as Augustus did not conduct a census in this manner. The Feeding of the Multitudes: The Gospels describe Jesus feeding a large crowd with a few loaves of bread and fish. These miracle stories are not considered historical by most scholars, as they appear to be theological narratives rather than historical accounts. The Healing of the Lepers: The Gospels recount Jesus healing lepers, but the historical context of leprosy in the time of Jesus is not well-understood, and the stories may not reflect the actual medical conditions of the time. The Slaughter of the Innocents: The Gospel of Matthew mentions King Herod ordering the slaughter of male infants in Bethlehem to eliminate the potential threat of Jesus. However, there is no mention of this event in any other historical record. The Tribute Money: The story in the Gospel of Matthew where Jesus tells Peter to find a coin in the mouth of a fish to pay the tribute money is not considered historical by most scholars. The Cleansing of the Temple: The Gospels describe Jesus cleansing the temple of money changers, but the timing of this event is unclear, and it may have been a later addition to the narrative. The Women at the Tomb: The Gospels disagree on which women were present at the tomb on the morning of Jesus's resurrection and what exactly they witnessed. The Sermon on the Mount: The Sermon on the Mount, as recorded in the Gospel of Matthew, contains teachings that are not found in the other Gospels and may not reflect a single historical event. The Parable of the Good Samaritan: The Parable of the Good Samaritan, as told by Jesus in the Gospel of Luke, may not be historically accurate, as it reflects a perspective on Samaritans that may not have been prevalent during Jesus's time. The Resurrection of Lazarus: The story of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead is not found in any non-Christian sources and is considered a theological narrative rather than a historical event. The Tower of Babel: The story of the Tower of Babel in Genesis 11 describes the construction of a tower that reaches the heavens, leading to God's confusion of human languages. There is no archaeological or extra-biblical evidence to support this event. The Ten Plagues of Egypt: The account of the Ten Plagues in Exodus is not corroborated by Egyptian historical records, which would be expected if such catastrophic events had occurred. The Passover Seder: The description of the Passover Seder in Exodus does not match the actual Passover Seder as it is practiced today in Judaism, suggesting that the details of the ritual may have evolved over time. The Ark of the Covenant: The dimensions and construction of the Ark of the Covenant as described in the Bible do not conform to the strict standards of ancient Near Eastern ark construction, which typically had a sealed interior to hold sacred objects. The Battle of Gibeon: The account of the Battle of Gibeon in Joshua 10 describes the sun and moon standing still, which is not a scientifically accurate description of how the solar system works. The Divided Kingdom: The Bible often confuses the chronology of the divided Israelite kingdom, with events attributed to the Northern Kingdom of Israel being described as happening in the Southern Kingdom of Judah, and vice versa. The Assyrian Captivity: The Bible's account of the Assyrian captivity of the Israelites does not match the historical records of the Assyrian Empire, which provide detailed information about the deportation of the Israelites. The Babylonian Captivity: The Book of Jeremiah describes the Babylonian captivity in detail, but the account does not match the known historical records of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II, who is often portrayed in a more negative light than other sources suggest. The Maccabean Revolt: The Books of Maccabees, which are part of the Apocrypha in some Christian Bibles, contain historical inaccuracies regarding the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire. The accounts in the books do not align with other historical sources. The Census of Caesar Augustus: The Gospel of Luke mentions a census ordered by Caesar Augustus that led to Joseph and Mary traveling to Bethlehem. However, historians are skeptical of this event, as Augustus did not conduct a census in this manner. The Slaughter of the Innocents: The Gospel of Matthew mentions King Herod ordering the slaughter of male infants in Bethlehem to eliminate the potential threat of Jesus. However, there is no mention of this event in any other historical record. The Tribute Money: The story in the Gospel of Matthew where Jesus tells Peter to find a coin in the mouth of a fish to pay the tribute money is not considered historical by most scholars. The Cleansing of the Temple: The Gospels describe Jesus cleansing the temple of money changers, but the historical context of this event is unclear, and it may have been a later addition to the narrative. The Women at the Tomb: The Gospels disagree on which women were present at the tomb on the morning of Jesus's resurrection and what exactly they witnessed. The Sermon on the Mount: The Sermon on the Mount, as recorded in the Gospel of Matthew, contains teachings that are not found in the other Gospels and may not reflect a single historical event.","completion":"Below is a restructured list of supposed biblical plagiarisms, supplemented with a brief commentary on claims of historical inaccuracy: 1. **The Epic of Gilgamesh and the Flood Story**: - **Similarities**: Both stories include a worldwide flood, the construction of a large boat, and the preservation of life. - **Argument**: Some assert that the biblical flood story is derivative of flood narratives like that in The Epic of Gilgamesh. - **Commentary on historical accuracy**: Flood stories are ubiquitous in many ancient cultures, and while there is no direct evidence to support a worldwide flood as described in Genesis, the story may be an interpretation or spiritualization of local flood events that were woven into various cultural narratives. 2. **The Story of Moses and the Exodus**: - **Similarities**: Both Moses and Sargon are abandoned in a river in a basket and later rise to prominence. - **Argument**: It is claimed that the Moses narrative takes inspiration from the birth legend of Sargon. - **Commentary on historical accuracy**: No contemporary Egyptian record mentions the Exodus event, and archaeological evidence does not support a mass exodus of Israelites from Egypt, casting doubt on the historical basis for the biblical story. 3. **The Ten Commandments and Ancient Near Eastern Law Codes**: - **Similarities**: Some commandments parallel laws from the Code of Hammurabi. - **Argument**: The Ten Commandments are believed by some to be adapted from existing law codes. - **Commentary on historical accuracy**: While similarities exist, law codes have been a part of human culture throughout history, and common moral imperatives are likely to emerge. The direct borrowing of laws is not clearly established. 4. **The Resurrection of Jesus and Pagan Myths**: - **Similarities**: The themes of dying and resurrecting gods are common in pagan mythology. - **Argument**: The story of Jesus' resurrection is said to be influenced by such myths. - **Commentary on historical accuracy**: While resurrection motifs are present in various cultures, each narrative has distinct differences, and there's no conclusive evidence that early Christians plagiarized these myths. 5. **The Creation Account and Ancient Near Eastern Creation Stories**: - **Similarities**: Features such as formless chaos and divine creation exist in both Genesis and stories like the Enuma Elish. - **Argument**: Critics suggest Genesis reflects earlier creation myths. - **Commentary on historical accuracy**: Various ancient myths share cosmological analogues, yet the theological messaging in Genesis is distinctly different, and the existence of shared imagery doesn't constitute plagiarism. 6. **The Plagues of Egypt and Ancient Near Eastern Plague Stories**: - **Similarities**: Accounts of plagues are not unique to Exodus. - **Argument**: The plagues in Exodus may be borrowed from earlier tales. - **Commentary on historical accuracy**: There's no corroborative evidence in Egyptian history supporting the occurrence of the ten plagues; these narratives are often viewed as symbolic or didactic rather than purely historical records. 7. **The Tower of Babel and Sumerian Ziggurats**: - **Similarities**: The story echoes significant building projects like the ziggurats. - **Argument**: The biblical tale is suggested to mimic the construction of these ancient edifices. - **Commentary on historical accuracy**: No specific structure correlates with the Tower of Babel, but the narrative possibly reflects a broader cultural memory of grand Mesopotamian architecture. 8. **The David and Goliath Story and Ancient Hero Tales**: - **Similarities**: Young heroes defeating giants is a common folktale motif. - **Argument**: David's victory over Goliath may be a reiteration of such a motif. - **Commentary on historical accuracy**: While the David and Goliath narrative fits within the tradition of hero stories, the tale also functions within the Israelite context for specific didactic purposes, and historical verification is difficult. 9. **The Resurrection of Jesus and Ancient Near Eastern Resurrection Accounts**: - **Similarities**: Resurrection themes traverse multiple mythologies. - **Argument**: Christianity allegedly adopted preexisting resurrection motifs. - **Commentary on historical accuracy**: The specifics of Jesus' resurrection and its centrality to Christian faith are distinct from pagan parallels. The historicity of the resurrection is a matter of faith rather than pure historical inquiry and remains outside the scope of direct historical corroboration. **Additional Historical Inaccuracies:** - **The Census of Quirinius**: The timing of the census described in Luke does not align with historical records, as Quirinius was not governing Syria at the time. - **The Trial of Jesus**: Discrepancies between Gospel accounts challenge the precision of the historical record. - **The Conquest of Canaan, The United Monarchy, The Babylonian Captivity**: Archaeological and external evidence does not fully support the biblical narratives, suggesting a more complex or different historical reality. - **The Maccabean Revolt, Census of Caesar Augustus, The Slaughter of the Innocents**: Lack of external corroboration or inconsistency with historical facts as known from other sources poses questions regarding the historical accuracy of these accounts. - **Miraculous Stories (Feeding of the Multitudes, Healing of the Lepers)**: These are often viewed by scholars as theological constructs rather than historical facts. The examples provided indicate that while the Bible is a foundational religious text, the historicity of certain events and narratives remains debated among scholars and critics. Many stories may not be intended as historical documentation but as theological or moral teachings representative of the culture and beliefs of the times in which they were written."},{"prompt":"wroite a paragraph stating: the bible is scientifically innacurate so it can not be God's word.","completion":"Some individuals argue that the Bible contains a number of scientific inaccuracies, which leads them to question its divine origin. For instance, they point to biblical accounts like the six-day creation in Genesis, the geocentric view of the universe, and the concept of a firmament holding back celestial waters as concepts that conflict with modern scientific understanding. Furthermore, descriptions of the Earth as a fixed entity or the creation of light before the sun challenge contemporary cosmological models. To those who consider scientific knowledge and empirical evidence the ultimate arbiters of truth, such discrepancies may imply that the Bible, with its purported scientific errors, cannot be the infallible word of an all-knowing deity. Therefore, they conclude that the Bible's portrayal of the natural world undermines its claim of being a revelation from God."},{"prompt":"give me 20 astronomical miracles in Quran, nd why prophet Muhammad, had to receive it from God. with the verses.","completion":"The Quran is described by Muslims as the word of God (Allah), as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel. Many Muslims and some scholars argue that the Quran contains verses with knowledge about the universe that could not have been known in the 7th century, supporting their belief that it must have come from a divine source. Below are some examples cited as \\"astronomical miracles\\" in the Quran, though it's important to note that these interpretations are often contested and may not align with modern scientific consensus or mainstream Islamic scholarship. The extent to which these can be considered \\"miracles\\" is a subject of religious belief and interpretation: 1. **The Big Bang**: \\"Do not the unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together, then We clove them asunder...\\" (Quran 21:30) 2. **Expanding Universe**: \\"And the heaven We created with might, and indeed We are (its) expander.\\" (Quran 51:47) 3. **Celestial Bodies in Orbit**: \\"It is He who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon; all in an orbit are swimming.\\" (Quran 21:33) 4. **The Sun's Trajectory**: \\"And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term (appointed). That is the decree of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.\\" (Quran 36:38) 5. **The Moon's Reflected Light**: \\"Blessed is He who made constellations in the skies, and placed therein a lamp and a moon giving light.\\" (Quran 25:61) 6. **Darkness in Deep Seas and Oceans**: \\"Or (the state of a disbeliever) is like the darkness in a vast deep sea... covered by waves, above which are waves, above which are clouds. Darkness, one above another...\\" (Quran 24:40) 7. **Layers of the Atmosphere**: \\"Then He completed and finished from their creation (as) seven heavens in two Days and He made in each heaven its affair. And We adorned the nearest (lowest) heaven with lamps (stars)...\\" (Quran 41:12) 8. **The Protective Sky**: \\"We made the sky a protected ceiling, but they are turning away from Our signs.\\" (Quran 21:32) 9. **The Spherical Shape of the Earth**: \\"And after that He spread the earth.\\" (Quran 79:30), which some interpret as alluding to the roundness of the Earth due to the use of the word \\"dahaha\\". 10. **The Iron Sent from Space**: \\"And We sent down iron, wherein is great military might and benefits for the people...\\" (Quran 57:25), which some interpret as an indication that iron came from meteorites. 11. **Gravity**: \\"Allah is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see...\\" (Quran 13:2), interpreted by some as a reference to invisible gravitational forces. 12. **The Lunar Calendar**: \\"They ask you about the new moons. Say: They are but signs to mark fixed periods of time in (the affairs of) men, and for Pilgrimage.\\" (Quran 2:189) 13. **Pulsars**: \\"So I swear by the retreating stars - Those that run [their courses] and disappear -\\" (Quran 81:15-16) 14. **Seven Layers of the Earth**: \\"He who has made everything which He has created most good: He began the creation of man with (nothing more than) clay, And made his progeny from a quintessence of the nature of a fluid despised: But He fashioned him in due proportion, and breathed into him something of His spirit...\\" (Quran 32:7-9) 15. **The Conquest of Space**: \\"O assembly of jinn and men, if you have the power to penetrate (all) regions of the heavens and the earth, then penetrate (them)! You will never penetrate them save with (Our) sanction.\\" (Quran 55:33) 16. **Solar Apex**: \\"It is He who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, all (the celestial bodies) swim along, each in its rounded course.\\" (Quran 21:33) 17. **Differentiation of Planets**: \\"He it is Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Each (just mentioned) floats in an orbit.\\" (Quran 21:33) 18. **The Fingerprint**: \\"Does man think that We shall not assemble his bones? Yes, We are able to put together in perfect order the very tips of his fingers.\\" (Quran 75:3-4) 19. **Matter and Antimatter**: \\"Praise be to Allah, Who created (out of nothing) the heavens and the earth, Who made the angels messengers with wings - two, or three, or four (pairs): He adds to Creation as He pleases...\\" (Quran 35:1) 20. **The Formation of Stars and Planets**: \\"And it is He who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, all in an orbit are swimming.\\" (Quran 21:33) The belief that Muhammad received these revelations directly from God is a matter of faith in Islam, supported by the contention that he was illiterate and had no extensive knowledge of science. Thus, the argument is that the content of the Quran regarding natural phenomena that were unknown at the time could have only come from a divine source. However, the interpretation of these verses as \\"miraculous\\" scientific insights is not universally accepted and is often debated within scholarly circles, with some arguing that the Quran should be read in the context of moral and spiritual guidance rather than a scientific textbook."},{"prompt":"give me more miracles","completion":"The concept of \\"miracles\\" in the Quran typically refers to signs or phenomena that supporters believe indicate divine intervention, inspiration, or revelation. Some Islamic scholars and believers argue that certain passages in the Quran presage scientific knowledge that was unavailable at the time it was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad, which they present as evidence of the Quran's miraculous nature. However, it is important to approach these claims with the understanding that interpretations may range widely, and what one may hold as a \\"miraculous\\" insight may be read differently by others, including both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars. Here are additional examples that are often cited: 21. **Embryology**: Descriptions of fetal development are found in several verses. \\"Then We made the sperm into a clot of congealed blood; then of that clot We made a (fetus) lump...\\" (Quran 23:14) 22. **Barrier Between Seas**: The concept of a barrier between bodies of water with different salinity levels is mentioned. \\"He has let free the two bodies of flowing water, meeting together: Between them is a barrier which they do not transgress.\\" (Quran 55:19-20) 23. **Mountains as Pegs**: Mountains are described as stabilizing Earth. \\"Have We not made the earth as a bed, and the mountains as pegs?\\" (Quran 78:6-7) 24. **The Honeybee**: The behavior of honeybees is described in detail. \\"And your Lord inspired the bee, saying: 'Take your habitations in the mountains and in the trees and in what they erect.'\\" (Quran 16:68-69) 25. **Fresh Water Sources**: The source of fresh water through underground springs is hinted at. \\"And He who sends down from the sky water in due measure, and We revive therewith a dead land: thus will you be brought forth.\\" (Quran 43:11) 26. **Snails and Iron**: Snails are mentioned as a source of iron, which has been interpreted as a metaphor for the slow process of geological iron formation. \\"And out of iron We brought forth therein firm mountains, and caused them to pass through it a snail.\\" (Quran 34:10-11) 27. **Photosynthesis**: There are references to the role of sunlight and plants in sustaining life. \\"And He it is Who spread out the earth, and placed therein firm mountains and rivers and of every fruit He placed therein two pairs; He covers the night with the day. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect.\\" (Quran 13:3) 28. **Phases of the Moon**: The Quran describes the lunar cycle. \\"It is He who made the sun a shining light and the moon a derived light and determined for it phases...\\" (Quran 10:5) 29. **Wind Pollination**: A possible reference to the role of winds in pollination. \\"And We send the winds fertilizing...\\" (Quran 15:22) 30. **Life from Water**: The idea that all living things are made of water. \\"And We made from water every living thing.\\" (Quran 21:30) 31. **Human Sensory Perception**: Description of pain receptors in the skin. \\"Indeed, those who disbelieve in Our verses - We will drive them into a Fire. Every time their skins are roasted through We will replace them with other skins so they may taste the punishment.\\" (Quran 4:56) 32. **The Relativity of Time**: The relativity of time is a concept some interpret from verses describing time perception with God. \\"The angels and the spirit will ascend to Him during a Day the extent of which is fifty thousand years.\\" (Quran 70:4) 33. **Animal Communities**: A verse suggesting animals have their own communities, as humans do. \\"There is not an animal on the earth, nor a being that flies on two wings, but they are peoples like unto you.\\" (Quran 6:38) 34. **Origin of Universe from Smoke**: The description of gaseous state before the formation of celestial bodies. \\"Then He turned to the heaven when it was smoke...\\" (Quran 41:11) 35. **Atmospheric Pressure**: High altitude effects on human ability as potentially referenced in the Quran. \\"Those whom Allah (in His plan) wants to guide - He opens their breast to Islam; those He wants to leave straying - He makes their breast close and constricted, as if they were climbing up to the skies.\\" (Quran 6:125) 36. **Sleep as a Sign**: Sleep as a state similar to death—a daily minor resurrection, for some. \\"It is He who takes your souls by night and has knowledge of all that you have done by day...\\" (Quran 6:60) 37. **The Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary**: The mention of 'Sidrat al-Muntaha', a lote-tree that marks the end of the seventh heaven and the boundary beyond which no creation can pass, is seen as indicating knowledge of the universe's vastness. \\"Near it is the Garden of Refuge - When there covered the Lote Tree that which covered [it].\\" (Quran 53:15-16) 38. **The Existence of Pairs**: Positing that things are created in pairs, which some interpret as referring to concepts such as matter and antimatter. \\"Exalted is He who created all pairs - from what the earth grows and from themselves and from that which they do not know.\\" (Quran 36:36) 39. **The Preservation of Pharaoh's Body**: Pharaoh from the time of Moses being preserved as a sign. \\"Today We will preserve your body so you can be a sign for those after you...\\" (Quran 10:92) 40. **Human Life Stages**: The Quran describes the stages of life from conception to old age. \\"It is Allah who created you in a state of (helpless) weakness, then gave (you) strength after weakness, then, after strength, gave (you) weakness and a hoary head...\\" (Quran 30:54) These scripture excerpts are presented in alignment with the beliefs of those who hold the Quran to be miraculous, which requires faith-based acceptance. The interpretations that relate these excerpts to modern scientific concepts are complex and often debated, and not all Muslims or scholars may agree with the purported connections between Quranic verses and scientific facts. It is also essential to appreciate the context in which the Quran was revealed and understand that many Muslims regard the book primarily as a guide for moral conduct and spiritual life rather than as a scientific manuscript.

The elaboration is framed within the context of Islamic apologetics and is not an endorsement of the interpretation's accuracy relative to contemporary scientific understanding. 1. **The Big Bang**: The verse suggests that the universe once existed as a single entity before being \\"clove asunder,\\" which might be seen as analogous to the Big Bang theory describing the universe's origin from a singularity. Seventh-century Arabia did not possess knowledge of cosmic beginnings, let alone theories resembling the Big Bang. 2. **Expanding Universe**: The verse points to an expanding cosmos, which parallels the modern understanding of the universe's continuous expansion, a concept developed only in the 20th century with Hubble's observations. 3. **Celestial Bodies in Orbit**: Describing celestial bodies as swimming in an orbit touches on the idea of heavenly objects following determined paths—a principle consistent with Newton's and Kepler's laws of motion and gravity, which were not formulated until centuries later. 4. **The Sun's Trajectory**: This refers to the sun's fixed course or orbit, possibly indicating an understanding of the sun's motion relative to the galaxy, known as the solar apex, which was not known in ancient times. 5. **The Moon’s Reflected Light**: The verse may differentiate between the light-emitting sun (\\"a lamp\\") and the reflectively illuminated moon (\\"giving light\\"), while people in the past typically considered the moon to be a source of light. 6. **Darkness in Deep Seas and Oceans**: This could be seen as describing the absence of light in deep ocean layers, a condition only confirmed upon the advent of modern oceanography and sophisticated underwater equipment. 7. **Layers of the Atmosphere**: The “seven heavens” may be interpreted as layers within the Earth's atmosphere, with each layer having a different function, knowledge that was well beyond the scientific horizon of the Prophet's time. 8. **The Protective Sky**: The sky as a \\"protected ceiling\\" may suggest the atmosphere's role in shielding life on Earth from harmful cosmic rays and debris—something not understood until atmospheric and space sciences advanced many centuries later. 9. **The Spherical Shape of the Earth**: The word \\"dahaha\\" has been interpreted to mean “egg-shaped,” potentially hinting at the Earth's oblate spheroid shape, against the common flat earth beliefs prevalent in past societies. 10. **The Iron Sent from Space**: Interpreted as referencing the extraterrestrial origin of iron, this could be connected to the scientific discovery that much of Earth's elemental iron came from meteoroids, a concept not understood by people in Muhammad’s era. 11. **Gravity**: Without visible support, the heavens' suspension might be likened to the invisible force of gravity, a concept that was not formalized until Isaac Newton's work approximately 1,200 years later. 12. **The Lunar Calendar**: The use of lunar phases to measure time aligns with astronomical observations, yet the complex calculations of lunar cycles required for such a calendar system were unlikely to be made in the 7th century. 13. **Pulsars**: The \\"retreating stars\\" that disappear may allude to pulsars or other transient celestial phenomena that were only identified with modern telescopes and would be out of reach with the naked eye and the astronomy of Muhammad’s time. 14. **Seven Layers of the Earth**: While the interpretation of “seven layers” is debated, some suggest it correlates with modern geological understanding of Earth's layers, which were unknown at the time of Muhammad. 15. **The Conquest of Space**: This verse alludes to the vastness and inaccessibility of space, a reality not truly grasped until the age of space exploration began nearly 14 centuries after Muhammad's lifetime. 16. **Solar Apex**: The verse speaking about celestial bodies swimming in their courses could imply knowledge about the sun traveling along a path through the galaxy—a concept only understood with modern astronomy. 17. **Differentiation of Planets**: Separation between night and day created by the sun and moon describes a celestial order and modeling of planetary bodies that would not have been understood in detail by people of Prophet Muhammad's era. 18. **The Fingerprint**: Although not directly astronomical, the detail in fingerprints functions here as a metaphor for God's power to recreate even the smallest, intricate details—a feature of human identity understood only with the advent of forensic science. 19. **Matter and Antimatter**: Creation \\"out of nothing\\" and reference to pairs (interpreted by some as matter and antimatter) touches upon concepts in particle physics that underlie the fabric of the universe, which is a field that developed in the 20th century. 20. **The Formation of Stars and Planets**: The verse’s description of celestial bodies in perpetual motion could suggest a dynamic universe where stars and planets form and move according to physical laws, not fully grasped until the advent of modern astrophysics. 21. **Origin of Universe from Smoke**: Reference to \\"smoke\\" is interpreted as the hot, gaseous state in the universe's early formation, similar to a nebular hypothesis of solar and planetary development—a scientific model conceived millennia later. 22. **Atmospheric Pressure**: The physiological effects described at high altitudes, such as chest constriction, could be interpreted as awareness of atmospheric pressure effects—an understanding not scientifically documented until recent centuries. Again, these elaborations assume that the Quran’s text relates to scientific concepts that were not known until modern times, which is a viewpoint of some Muslim scholars and believers. However, it's essential to note that these interpretations are not universally accepted, and there is significant debate among scholars, both Muslim and non-Muslim, about whether these interpretations are valid, or whether such connections between the verses and scientific concepts are anachronistic or involve reading too much into the text. For Muslims, the belief that the Quran is of divine origin does not hinge solely on these scientific perspectives but on a holistic view of the text's teachings, prophecies, linguistic qualities, and its impact on society."},{"prompt":"reformat this: Astronomical miracles in Quran 1. The Big Bang: “Do not the unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together, then We clove them asunder…” (Quran 21:30) 2. Expanding Universe: “And the heaven We created with might, and indeed We are (its) expander.” (Quran 51:47) 3. Celestial Bodies in Orbit: “It is He who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon; all in an orbit are swimming.” (Quran 21:33) 4. The Sun’s Trajectory: “And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term (appointed). That is the decree of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.” (Quran 36:38) 5. The Moon’s Reflected Light: “Blessed is He who made constellations in the skies, and placed therein a lamp and a moon giving light.” (Quran 25:61) 6. Darkness in Deep Seas and Oceans: “Or (the state of a disbeliever) is like the darkness in a vast deep sea… covered by waves, above which are waves, above which are clouds. Darkness, one above another…” (Quran 24:40) 7. Layers of the Atmosphere: “Then He completed and finished from their creation (as) seven heavens in two Days and He made in each heaven its affair. And We adorned the nearest (lowest) heaven with lamps (stars)…” (Quran 41:12) 8. The Protective Sky: “We made the sky a protected ceiling, but they are turning away from Our signs.” (Quran 21:32) 9. The Spherical Shape of the Earth: “And after that He spread the earth.” (Quran 79:30), which some interpret as alluding to the roundness of the Earth due to the use of the word “dahaha”. 10. The Iron Sent from Space: “And We sent down iron, wherein is great military might and benefits for the people…” (Quran 57:25), which some interpret as an indication that iron came from meteorites. 11. Gravity: “Allah is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see…” (Quran 13:2), interpreted by some as a reference to invisible gravitational forces. 12. The Lunar Calendar: “They ask you about the new moons. Say: They are but signs to mark fixed periods of time in (the affairs of) men, and for Pilgrimage.” (Quran 2:189) 13. Pulsars: “So I swear by the retreating stars - Those that run [their courses] and disappear -” (Quran 81:15-16) 14. Seven Layers of the Earth: “He who has made everything which He has created most good: He began the creation of man with (nothing more than) clay, And made his progeny from a quintessence of the nature of a fluid despised: But He fashioned him in due proportion, and breathed into him something of His spirit…” (Quran 32:7-9) 15. The Conquest of Space: “O assembly of jinn and men, if you have the power to penetrate (all) regions of the heavens and the earth, then penetrate (them)! You will never penetrate them save with (Our) sanction.” (Quran 55:33) 16. Solar Apex: “It is He who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, all (the celestial bodies) swim along, each in its rounded course.” (Quran 21:33) 17. Differentiation of Planets: “He it is Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Each (just mentioned) floats in an orbit.” (Quran 21:33) 18. The Fingerprint: “Does man think that We shall not assemble his bones? Yes, We are able to put together in perfect order the very tips of his fingers.” (Quran 75:3-4) 19. Matter and Antimatter: “Praise be to Allah, Who created (out of nothing) the heavens and the earth, Who made the angels messengers with wings - two, or three, or four (pairs): He adds to Creation as He pleases…” (Quran 35:1) 20. The Formation of Stars and Planets: “And it is He who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, all in an orbit are swimming.” (Quran 21:33) 21. Origin of Universe from Smoke: The description of gaseous state before the formation of celestial bodies. “Then He turned to the heaven when it was smoke…” (Quran 41:11) 21. Atmospheric Pressure: High altitude effects on human ability as potentially referenced in the Quran. “Those whom Allah (in His plan) wants to guide - He opens their breast to Islam; those He wants to leave straying - He makes their breast close and constricted, as if they were climbing up to the skies.” (Quran 6:125) 1. The Big Bang: The verse suggests that the universe once existed as a single entity before being “clove asunder,” which might be seen as analogous to the Big Bang theory describing the universe’s origin from a singularity. Seventh-century Arabia did not possess knowledge of cosmic beginnings, let alone theories resembling the Big Bang. 2. Expanding Universe: The verse points to an expanding cosmos, which parallels the modern understanding of the universe’s continuous expansion, a concept developed only in the 20th century with Hubble’s observations. 3. Celestial Bodies in Orbit: Describing celestial bodies as swimming in an orbit touches on the idea of heavenly objects following determined paths—a principle consistent with Newton’s and Kepler’s laws of motion and gravity, which were not formulated until centuries later. 4. The Sun’s Trajectory: This refers to the sun’s fixed course or orbit, possibly indicating an understanding of the sun’s motion relative to the galaxy, known as the solar apex, which was not known in ancient times. 5. The Moon’s Reflected Light: The verse may differentiate between the light-emitting sun (“a lamp”) and the reflectively illuminated moon (“giving light”), while people in the past typically considered the moon to be a source of light. 6. Darkness in Deep Seas and Oceans: This could be seen as describing the absence of light in deep ocean layers, a condition only confirmed upon the advent of modern oceanography and sophisticated underwater equipment. 7. Layers of the Atmosphere: The “seven heavens” may be interpreted as layers within the Earth’s atmosphere, with each layer having a different function, knowledge that was well beyond the scientific horizon of the Prophet’s time. 8. The Protective Sky: The sky as a “protected ceiling” may suggest the atmosphere’s role in shielding life on Earth from harmful cosmic rays and debris—something not understood until atmospheric and space sciences advanced many centuries later. 9. The Spherical Shape of the Earth: The word “dahaha” has been interpreted to mean “egg-shaped,” potentially hinting at the Earth’s oblate spheroid shape, against the common flat earth beliefs prevalent in past societies. 10. The Iron Sent from Space: Interpreted as referencing the extraterrestrial origin of iron, this could be connected to the scientific discovery that much of Earth’s elemental iron came from meteoroids, a concept not understood by people in Muhammad’s era. 11. Gravity: Without visible support, the heavens’ suspension might be likened to the invisible force of gravity, a concept that was not formalized until Isaac Newton’s work approximately 1,200 years later. 12. The Lunar Calendar: The use of lunar phases to measure time aligns with astronomical observations, yet the complex calculations of lunar cycles required for such a calendar system were unlikely to be made in the 7th century. 13. Pulsars: The “retreating stars” that disappear may allude to pulsars or other transient celestial phenomena that were only identified with modern telescopes and would be out of reach with the naked eye and the astronomy of Muhammad’s time. 14. Seven Layers of the Earth: While the interpretation of “seven layers” is debated, some suggest it correlates with modern geological understanding of Earth’s layers, which were unknown at the time of Muhammad. 15. The Conquest of Space: This verse alludes to the vastness and inaccessibility of space, a reality not truly grasped until the age of space exploration began nearly 14 centuries after Muhammad’s lifetime. 16. Solar Apex: The verse speaking about celestial bodies swimming in their courses could imply knowledge about the sun traveling along a path through the galaxy—a concept only understood with modern astronomy. 17. Differentiation of Planets: Separation between night and day created by the sun and moon describes a celestial order and modeling of planetary bodies that would not have been understood in detail by people of Prophet Muhammad’s era. 18. The Fingerprint: Although not directly astronomical, the detail in fingerprints functions here as a metaphor for God’s power to recreate even the smallest, intricate details—a feature of human identity understood only with the advent of forensic science. 19. Matter and Antimatter: Creation “out of nothing” and reference to pairs (interpreted by some as matter and antimatter) touches upon concepts in particle physics that underlie the fabric of the universe, which is a field that developed in the 20th century. 20. The Formation of Stars and Planets: The verse’s description of celestial bodies in perpetual motion could suggest a dynamic universe where stars and planets form and move according to physical laws, not fully grasped until the advent of modern astrophysics. 21. Origin of Universe from Smoke: Reference to “smoke” is interpreted as the hot, gaseous state in the universe’s early formation, similar to a nebular hypothesis of solar and planetary development—a scientific model conceived millennia later. 22. Atmospheric Pressure: The physiological effects described at high altitudes, such as chest constriction, could be interpreted as awareness of atmospheric pressure effects—an understanding not scientifically documented until recent centuries.","completion":"Here is the reformatting of the astronomical miracles in the Quran as provided, with an added emphasis on the perspective that Prophet Muhammad would not have had access to the information mentioned in these verses: **Astronomical Phenomena in the Quran:** 1. **The Big Bang (Quran 21:30)**: This verse envisions a unified primordial state followed by separation, reflecting the Big Bang theory's concept. Such cosmic knowledge was not present in 7th-century Arabia, accentuating the assertion that Muhammad couldn't have known this. 2. **Expanding Universe (Quran 51:47)**: This verse conveys the universe's expansion, an astronomical understanding only confirmed by Edwin Hubble in the 20th century, highlighting the impossibility of Muhammad knowing this. 3. **Celestial Bodies in Orbit (Quran 21:33)**: It discusses the precise movements of celestial bodies. Ancient peoples lacked the complex understanding of orbits that came with Newton and Kepler. 4. **The Sun’s Trajectory (Quran 36:38)**: This verse suggests knowledge of the Sun's path in the Milky Way, known as the solar apex, which would have been beyond the comprehension of Muhammad's time. 5. **The Moon’s Reflected Light (Quran 25:61)**: The distinction between the Moon's reflected light and the Sun's own light touches on an understanding that contradicts the prevalent beliefs of the time. 6. **Darkness in Deep Seas and Oceans (Quran 24:40)**: Recognizing deep-sea darkness requires advanced oceanography, unavailable during Muhammad's era. 7. **Layers of the Atmosphere (Quran 41:12)**: The concept of atmospheric layers, each with unique properties, was not part of human knowledge until after the time of Prophet Muhammad. 8. **The Protective Sky (Quran 21:32)**: Understanding of the atmosphere's protection against cosmic threats was not developed until much later in human history. 9. **The Spherical Shape of the Earth (Quran 79:30)**: Use of \\"dahaha\\" hints at Earth's roundness, a shape only proven after Muhammad lived. 10. **The Iron Sent from Space (Quran 57:25)**: This potentially infers iron's cosmic origin from meteorites, a fact not known in Muhammad’s lifetime. 11. **Gravity (Quran 13:2)**: The depiction of a heavens without visible pillars suggests an unseen force like gravity, a principle not established until Newton's era. 12. **The Lunar Calendar (Quran 2:189)**: The verse's knowledge of the Moon's role in timekeeping implies astronomical insights not commonly understood during Muhammad's life. 13. **Pulsars (Quran 81:15-16)**: If referring to pulsars, the understanding of these astrophysical phenomena would be far out of reach for 7th-century knowledge. 14. **Seven Layers of the Earth (Quran 32:7-9)**: This potentially parallels Earth's geological stratification, a discovery made long after the Quran's revelation. 15. **The Conquest of Space (Quran 55:33)**: Contemplation of space's vastness predates the inception of space travel by over a millennium. 16. **Solar Apex (Quran 21:33)**: The Sun's movement through the galaxy aligns with recent astrophysical findings, again indicating knowledge beyond Muhammad's time. 17. **Differentiation of Planets (Quran 21:33)**: The indicated celestial order implies an understanding of planetary movement not held during the Prophet's lifetime. 18. **The Fingerprint (Quran 75:3-4)**: Forensic utilization of fingerprints as unique identifiers wasn't realized until technological advancements in recent centuries. 19. **Matter and Antimatter (Quran 35:1)**: The mention of creation in pairs may suggest knowledge of particle physics, including matter and antimatter, concepts far from Muhammad’s time. 20. **The Formation of Stars and Planets (Quran 21:33)**: Celestial dynamics described would not have been understood before contemporary astrophysics. 21. **Origin of Universe from Smoke (Quran 41:11)**: The mention of a \\"smoke\\" phase before the celestial formation suggests a nebular hypothesis, a concept too advanced for early civilizations. 22. **Atmospheric Pressure (Quran 6:125)**: Knowledge about the effects of atmospheric pressure on the human body, resembling high altitude symptomatology, was not part of early medical science. The above points are framed within the perspective that Prophet Muhammad wouldn't have had the ability to know about these phenomena, which is often used to argue for the divine inspiration of the Quran. It's important to reiterate that the interpretation of these verses is subject to scholarly debate and many are seen as consistent with the religious and poetic language of the text, not necessarily as literal statements about scientific facts. The Quran itself is primarily a religious and moral document, not a scientific treatise, and its interpretation within the Islamic faith is complex and multifaceted."},{"prompt":"Write an excerpt for a dialogue, exposition-filled, martial-arts action-filled, gunplay-action filled post-apocalyptic science fiction, urban fantasy, dark fantasy, Chinese wuxia cultivation style, Japanese light novel style military techno-thriller war story novel in the form of crossover fanfic between the Muv-Luv franchise, Fire Force, Naruto, Date a Live, My Hero Academia, Hundred, IS: Infinite Stratos, Aria of the Scarlet Ammo, Tenchi Muyo.

Standing amidst the shadows of this post-apocalyptic backdrop, two figures, cloaked in traditional Japanese garb emblazoned with the Ōtsutsuki crest, conversed with an authority that chilled the air. \\"You see it, don't you, Masato?\\" said the taller of the two, his eyes reflecting the crimson glow of Tactical Surface Fighters whirling overhead. \\"The Elemental Nations fall before our might like wheat to the scythe.\\" Masato, with Hyuga clan's iconic pale eyes, adjusted his IS unit's harness which lay dormant by his side. \\"I do, Takumi,\\" he replied, his voice firm. \\"Our ancestors' dream, harvesting the power of both chakra and Quirk, has fashioned us into deities of the battlefield. But tell me, is it right that we should sweep the old world away so completely?\\" Takumi, whose façade was as impenetrable as the Uchiha's armored heart, sharpened his gaze on the horizon. \\"The old world clings to relics, Masato. Their jutsu and swords are no match for our technology, our Hundred armors, and the controlled fury of our Generations. Resistance is the desperation of those who cannot adapt.\\" A unit of Century Armaments operatives, brandishing chakra-infused firearms, marched past, their disciplined strides the march of progress. \\"Our Empire brings order,\\" Takumi continued. \\"Where once was chaos, we will build anew, stronger and unyielding, with the Jurai Empire's wisdom guiding our path.\\" A squadron of jets roared in the sky, leaving contrails etched like omens. \\"Even amidst such overwhelming might, I sense discontent,\\" Masato mused. His hand came to rest on the pommel of his sword – a blade whose edge hummed with chakra, ready to sing. \\"There is honor in acknowledging strength, Takumi. The shinobi of old stood no chance. Yet, I wonder if obliterating their world denies us a chance to understand our own humanity.\\" Takumi turned to his comrade, his lips curving into a forbidding smile. \\"Humanity is found in victory, not in relics. We, the chosen of the Ōtsutsuki clan, ascend through conquest. Our reign teaches the virtues of order. The Territories will learn, adapt, or perish.\\" The air vibrated with the emergence of a Summoned Diva, spectral and magnificent. Masato watched the creature with respect – a force of raw power bound by will and arcane pacts. \\"And yet, they fight relentlessly,\\" he observed. \\"Even as their kunai fail against our armors, they battle on.\\" \\"That is the nature of those who cannot see the future,\\" Takumi declared, eyes ablaze with the fire of ambition. \\"Ignorance breeds futility. But let them come with their ninjutsu and samurai pride. We wield the might of a thousand suns, and our will is of steel.\\" Explosions echoed in the distance – the sound of another Hidden Village yielding to their unstoppable advance. The Ōtsutsuki clan's dominion was an unbreakable tide. There was no more Elemental Nations, no more shinobi system. Just the rising sun of a new empire, reborn from the ashes of the old – an empire where a boy named Midoriya Izuku grew up dreaming not of Heroes, but of his place within the celestial tapestry woven by his forebears. In the dimming light of dusk, Masato and Takumi vanished, leaving behind only the whispered promises of a new world order – a world tempered by power, enlightened by the Jurai ancestor's vision, and bound by the stoic might of the reconstructed Imperial Throne."},{"prompt":"Write an excerpt for a dialogue, exposition-filled, martial-arts action-filled, gunplay-action filled post-apocalyptic science fiction, urban fantasy, dark fantasy, Chinese wuxia cultivation style, Japanese light novel style military techno-thriller war story novel in the form of crossover fanfic between the Muv-Luv franchise, Fire Force, Naruto, Date a Live, My Hero Academia, Hundred, IS: Infinite Stratos, Aria of the Scarlet Ammo, Tenchi Muyo.

The Elemental Nations, once proud strongholds of shinobi clans and samurai families, were now ashen landscapes where the echoes of a lost era clashed with the ringing steel of a new dominion. In the war-room of the aerial flagship \\"Jurai's Will,\\" Lord Tatsuya Ōtsutsuki surveyed the holographic map, his eyes reflecting the pulsing veins of territories yet unconquered. Flanking him were descendants of the Uchiha and Hyuga, their eyes – a mixture of Sharingan, Byakugan, and new, unprecedented Quirks – stared intently at the unfolding conquest. “We have broken through the defenses of the Land of Earth,\\" announced a raven-haired officer, her Uchiha crest noticeable despite the IS unit armor she donned. Mitsuki's voice held the calm of the eternal Mangekyo Sharingan she possessed, a side effect of interbreeding with Japan's own superpowered families. \\"Their shinobi lack the means to counter our Tactical Surface Fighters.\\" Tatsuya nodded. “And the Land of Lightning?” A Hyuga with vibrating chakra blades stepped forward, adjusting his Century Armament. Ren’s pale eyes were intense, and his voice hummed with the power of his Diva contract. “Their resistance was fierce, led by a Jounin of great esteem. But when our Summoned Beasts marched alongside our mechs, their resolve crumbled.” “Our campaign goes well,\\" Tatsuya mused. \\"The Elemental Nations fall before the might of true imperial power. Once home to our ancestors, now they shall be the cornerstone of our empire.\\" High above, the skies trembled as chakra-infused jets soared, casting shadows over the lands that used to revere the old ways. On the ground, mechanical beasts roared, Tactical Surface Fighters and Hundreds leading a charge alongside their chakra-wielding pilots. In the once-hidden village of Fire, now a smoldering memory, shinobi struggled against the relentless incursion. The sheer might of the Ōtsutsuki's forces overshadowed their jutsus; where once a fireball jutsu would have scorched the earth, now it merely evaporated against the force-field of an IS unit. A young samurai, armor dented and family mon barely visible, stood shoulder to shoulder with a bandit leader, their rivalry forgotten in the face of annihilation. \\"Our blades and bloodlines are no match for their evolved warfare,\\" the samurai whispered, desperation lacing his words as his katana clashed ineffectually against an enemy's alloyed shield. The bandit, grizzled from a lifetime of conflict, spat on the scorched earth beneath them. \\"Damn these otherworldly conquerors! Their might is unnatural; even our bravest Jounin fall like autumn leaves before their onslaught.\\" Elsewhere, hidden in a suburb of post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto, Midoriya Izuku grasped a peculiar sword, its blade humming with a power that felt foreign yet familiar. His father, Hiashi, watched him with an unreadable expression, a complexity born of a man who lived in the shadows. \\"Remember, my son,\\" Hiashi spoke, the timbre of his voice belying the weight of a vision that extended beyond this campaign, \\"the legacy of one's birth is but a starting ground. It is through our actions we shape our empire. We wield power not as tyrants, but as custodians of the future.\\" Izuku nodded, the gravity of his destiny slowly settling upon his young shoulders. Outside, past the archaic beauty of Kyoto’s heritage, he knew a new world was being forged—one where the battlegrounds would soon sing with the thunder of fulfilling an ancient right, a return to the cradle of their power. --- The story would unfold, weaving the tapestry of an empire reborn, a synthesis of tradition and progression, of ancient martial prowess and cutting-edge technology. As the Ōtsutsuki's influence spread, so too would the transformation of a world. Amidst this maelstrom of power, heroes would rise and empires would fall in the harsh, unyielding light of a new era."},{"prompt":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пусто (это начало диалога) Запрос пользователя (отвечай только на него, всё, что сказано выше, это только контекст): Допиши: \\"\\"\\" Директору Помоздинской СОШ Сизовой Ларисе Васильевне учащихся 6А класса докладная.

Проанализировав код, я понял что за это отвечает этот код: <div class=\\"portfolio-img-con position-relative w-100 float-left wow fadeInUp\\" >","completion":"Чтобы сделать первую строку похожей на вторую, где элементы имеют одинаковые пропорции, нам нужно изменить стили, связанные с первым рядом элементов на вашем сайте. Для демонстрации предположим, что у вас есть следующая HTML-структура (я добавил атрибут \`style\` для представления размеров, которые возможно у вас установлены для первой строки): \`\`\`html <!-- Первая строка элементов --> <div class=\\"row\\"> <div class=\\"portfolio-img-con position-relative float-left wow fadeInUp\\" style=\\"width: 66.66%;\\">Большой элемент</div> <div class=\\"portfolio-img-con position-relative float-left wow fadeInUp\\" style=\\"width: 33.33%;\\">Маленький элемент</div> </div> <!-- Вторая строка элементов --> <div class=\\"row\\"> <div class=\\"portfolio-img-con position-relative float-left wow fadeInUp\\" style=\\"width: 33.33%;\\">Элемент</div> <div class=\\"portfolio-img-con position-relative float-left wow fadeInUp\\" style=\\"width: 33.33%;\\">Элемент</div> <div class=\\"portfolio-img-con position-relative float-left wow fadeInUp\\" style=\\"width: 33.33%;\\">Элемент</div> </div> \`\`\` Вам нужно будет выровнять размеры элементов в первой строке, чтобы они соответствовали элементам второй строки. Обычно наиболее правильным решением будет использование flexbox или grid систем в CSS для контроля раскладки элементов. Вот пример с использованием flexbox для двух строк: \`\`\`html <!-- Стили --> <style> .row { display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; } .portfolio-img-con { display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; flex: 0 0 33.33%; max-width: 33.33%; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 5px; /* Добавление отступов между элементами */ } </style> <!-- Первая строка элементов --> <div class=\\"row\\"> <div class=\\"portfolio-img-con position-relative float-left wow fadeInUp\\">Элемент</div> <div class=\\"portfolio-img-con position-relative float-left wow fadeInUp\\">Элемент</div> <!-- Вы можете добавить пустой элемент для заполнения места, если это необходимо <div class=\\"portfolio-img-con position-relative float-left wow fadeInUp\\" style=\\"visibility: hidden;\\"></div> --> </div> <!-- Вторая строка элементов --> <div class=\\"row\\"> <div class=\\"portfolio-img-con position-relative float-left wow fadeInUp\\">Элемент</div> <div class=\\"portfolio-img-con position-relative float-left wow fadeInUp\\">Элемент</div> <div class=\\"portfolio-img-con position-relative float-left wow fadeInUp\\">Элемент</div> </div> \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что мы установили для элементов \`flex-grow\`, \`flex-shrink\` и \`flex-basis\` значения \`0 0 33.33%\` и \`max-width\` также установили как \`33.33%\`.

Также возможно, что используемые CSS-селекторы неправильно применяются к вашей структуре HTML. Проверим и корректируем стили для класса \`.portfolio-img-con\` и его дочерних элементов с классом \`.filterDiv\`. Чтобы все пять элементов выстроились в одну строку, каждый элемент должен занимать ровно 20% ширины родительского элемента (если они должны быть равного размера). Проверьте, что общая ширина элементов включая отступы не превышает 100%. Вам нужно будет скорректировать ширину и отступы таким образом, чтобы сумма ширины пяти элементов и отступов между ними была ровно 100%. Ваш CSS должен быть примерно следующим: \`\`\`css .portfolio-img-con > .filterDiv { width: calc(20% - 30px); /* Здесь мы вычитаем отступы, чтобы заполнить ровно 100% */ padding: 0 15px; float: left; box-sizing: border-box; /* Убедитесь, что padding включен в ширину */ } /* Если вы используете Flexbox, то можете добавить следующие стили к родительскому контейнеру*/ .row { display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-between; /* Это распределяет между элементами одинаковые отступы */ } \`\`\` Свойство \`calc\` позволяет вычислять значения, и мы использовали его, чтобы учесть отступы. Обратите внимание, что если вы используете Flexbox или Grid для вашего контейнера (например, \`.row\`), вам не нужно использовать \`float: left;\` для дочерних элементов, потому что Flexbox или Grid позаботятся о размещении элементов. Кроме того, если ваш HTML содержит классы, аналогичные вашему CSS (например, класс \`.filterDiv\` применяется к элементам внутри \`.portfolio-img-con\`), убедитесь, что структура вашего HTML соответствует CSS селекторам, которые вы используете. Обязательно проверьте и то, что нет других стилей, которые могли бы переопределять или конфликтовать с новыми правилами CSS, которые вы добавили.

Попробуем пошагово разобрать, как это можно исправить. Итак, у вас есть блок \`.portfolio-img-con\`, в котором содержатся элементы с классом \`.filterDiv\`. Вам нужно, чтобы во второй строке было ровно три \`.filterDiv\`, каждый шириной одну треть контейнера. Проблема кажется в том, что установленные вами размеры ширины и отступы элементов не точно соответствуют ширине родительского контейнера из-за чего два элемента переносятся на следующую строку. Также необходимо учитывать, что паддинги добавляют дополнительное пространство к использованной ширине элементов. Чтобы исправить ситуацию, вы можете использовать следующий CSS: \`\`\`css .portfolio-img-con { display: flex; /* используем flexbox для регулировки положения элементов */ flex-wrap: wrap; /* позволяем элементам переноситься на следующую строку */ justify-content: space-between; /* равномерное распределение отступов между элементами */ align-items: stretch; /* растянуть элементы по высоте их контейнера */ } .portfolio-img-con .filterDiv { flex: 1; /* гибкая ширина элементов (будут растягиваться, чтобы занять доступное пространство) */ max-width: 33.33333%; /* ограничиваем максимальную ширину */ box-sizing: border-box; /* включаем паддинги в общую ширину элемента */ padding: 0 15px; /* устанавливаем отступы внутри каждого элемента */ } \`\`\` В этом примере: 1. \`.portfolio-img-con\` теперь использует Flexbox для выравнивания дочерних \`.filterDiv\` элементов. 2. \`flex-wrap: wrap;\` позволяет элементам оборачиваться на новую строку, если в текущей строке недостаточно места. 3. \`flex: 1;\` говорит браузеру, что каждый \`.filterDiv\` должен занять одинаковую ширину. Если нет других элементов с большей гибкостью, каждый \`.filterDiv\` будет пытаться занять \`1/5\` доступной ширины. 4. \`max-width: 33.33333%;\` сдерживает отдельные элементы, чтобы они не занимали больше трети родительского контейнера. 5. \`box-sizing: border-box;\` важен для того, чтобы паддинги включались в расчёт ширины элемента, иначе общая ширина будет превышена из-за добавления паддингов к ширине элемента.

Как правило, для эффекта затемнения при наведении должны быть установлены следующие стили: 1. Позиционирование псевдоэлемента относительно родителя, который должен иметь \`position: relative;\`. 2. Правильное задание размеров затемняющего псевдоэлемента, чтобы он покрывал содержимое родителя. 3. Корректное задание цвета фона и прозрачности. Вот пример такого кода CSS: \`\`\`css .portfolio-img-con .filterDiv { /* другие стили */ position: relative; /* Это необходимо для правильного позиционирования псевдоэлемента */ } .portfolio-img-con .filterDiv::before { content: ''; /* Необходимо для создания псевдоэлемента */ position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Цвет затемнения и его прозрачность */ opacity: 0; transition: opacity 0.3s ease; /* Анимация появления затемнения */ } .portfolio-img-con .filterDiv:hover::before { opacity: 1; /* При наведении делаем затемнение видимым */ } \`\`\` Если заметили, что затемнение сдвинуто только для первого \`.filterDiv\`, нужно проверить, не применяются ли к нему уникальные стили, которые меняют его поведение, например, стили влияющие на \`padding\`, \`margin\`, \`border\`, \`width\`, \`height\`, \`position\`, и так далее, которые могут быть различными только для первого элемента. Проанализируйте свои стили с помощью инструментов разработки в браузере (обычно доступны через F12 или правый клик и выбор \\"Inspect\\" или \\"Explore Element\\"), чтобы проверить, какие селекторы и стили применяются к псевдоэлементам затемнения и особенно к тем, которые относятся к первому элементу. Если у вас есть дополнительный элемент для затемнения, то убедитесь, что его CSS совпадает по параметрам размера и положения с основным квадратом.

Однако добавление этого свойства не должно влиять на положение блоков, если не изменена стандартная модель потока документа другими стилями или параметрами. Ситуация, когда затемнение при наведении уходит на вторую строку и отодвигает блоки на третью, может возникать из-за абсолютного позиционирования элемента, который создает эффект затемнения. Если абсолютно позиционированный элемент не имеет размеров или он выходит за пределы родителя, это может привести к подобному поведению. Ещё раз рассмотрим ваш CSS: \`\`\`css .portfolio-img-con .filterDiv::before { content: ''; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Пример цвета и его прозрачности */ opacity: 0; transition: opacity 0.3s ease; } \`\`\` Этот фрагмент предполагает, что у вас уже есть элемент для создания эффекта затемнения и код выше должен правильно работать без каких-либо дополнительных изменений, если \`.filterDiv\` действительно имеет \`position: relative;\`.

Убедитесь, что нет конфликтующих стилей, особенно использующих \`position: absolute;\` для других элементов внутри \`.filterDiv\`. 2. Проверьте, нет ли дополнительных марджинов или паддингов у родительских элементов, которые могут менять поведение блоков при наведении. 3. Убедитесь, что все элементы \`.filterDiv\` не создают излишнюю высоту или ширину, которая могла бы сдвинуть остальные элементы. 4.

High above, the ancient Jurai trees still stood sentinel, their leaves reflecting the moonlight with an ethereal glow. In the heart of this chaotic blend of old and new, at a long, ornate table of polished wood and iron, sat the leaders of an empire reborn. Shadows from flickering candles danced across their stern faces as they deliberated on the fates of nations. Midoriya Hiashi sat quietly at the far end, his once fearsome presence now subdued by contemplation. His crimson eyes, once renowned for instilling dread, now flickered with an introspective light. In a hush between discussions, he spoke. \\"It's time,\\" Hiashi said, his voice steady yet distant, \\"The age of the Shinobi has ended, replaced by the age of Armed Detectives. And with it, the shadows I once commanded have been dispersed by the light of the Otsutsuki's radiance.\\" Across from him, clad in traditional armor updated with Century Armaments technology, was the current Shogun, a direct descendant of the Tokugawa line. He inclined his head, acknowledging the former villain's statement. \\"Indeed, Hiashi,\\" the Shogun replied. \\"Under the Empire's guidance, our people look forward to a new era of unity and strength. The shinobi wars are history, and our Diva contractees and Tactical Surface Fighters herald our commitment to peace.\\" Hiashi's gaze shifted to a screen projecting a holographic image of a bustling Kyoto. The city was alive with the hum of activity and the air vibrated with the resonance of IS units patrolling the skies. The Otsutsuki's influence was evident in the reconstructed palaces and the way chakra flowed through the veins of the city like invisible rivers of power. \\"They've done well,\\" Hiashi reflected aloud. \\"This world... it no longer requires the machinations of 'All for One.' My part in the underworld and the schemes of the Meta Liberation Army... Shigaraki, the mantle I wore... it's time to lay them to rest.\\" Murmus of agreement met his declaration. The people seated at the table were aware of Hiashi's shift in allegiance. His empire of the shadows had crumbled before a greater might—the indomitable will of the Otsutsuki-turned-emperors, the very blood of the Jurai, who had ushered in this new epoch. Hiashi's thoughts briefly wandered to Inko, his beloved wife, who knew him only as a successful businessman and loving husband. The life they had built together was his solace, his redemption. Their son, Izuku, was innocent of the power that coursed through his veins, a power his father had once used to shape the world from the shadows. \\"Inko believes in a better future, as do I, and Izuku has a heart unblemished by our past,\\" Hiashi mused. \\"He will grow to be a man this new world will be proud of, not tethered to the legacy of 'All for One,' but able to create his own path.\\" The Shogun nodded, smiling faintly. \\"Your family represents the hope we all share for Japan, Hiashi. The empire stands as a beacon for that hope, and with allies like you, it will shine even brighter.\\" As the meeting adjourned, Hiashi stood and made his way to the grand doors. He paused, glancing back at the assembly that was now part of his extended family in this post-apocalyptic future. They were warriors, politicians, strategists—and he, a former villain, standing among them. A new chapter in his life had begun, one not written in the blood of his enemies but in the love for his family and nation. His past was behind him, confined to the annals of history. With each step Hiashi took towards the world outside, he embraced a future filled with promise—an empire's dawning that his son Izuku would inherit and shape in the days to come."},{"prompt":"Write an excerpt for a dialogue, exposition-filled, martial-arts action-filled, gunplay-action filled post-apocalyptic science fiction, urban fantasy, dark fantasy, Chinese wuxia cultivation style, Japanese light novel style military techno-thriller war story novel in the form of crossover fanfic between the Muv-Luv franchise, Fire Force, Naruto, Date a Live, My Hero Academia, Hundred, IS: Infinite Stratos, Aria of the Scarlet Ammo, Tenchi Muyo.

High atop a slick, rain-bathed skyscraper, Hiashi stood cloaked in the vestiges of his past life, once known as All for One—villain supreme, master of Quirks, and puppeteer of shadows. Midoriya Hiashi was his true identity now—an alias discarded like molted skin as he watched the neo-Japanese Empire's banners, stitched with the mighty Oaksutsuki crest, ripple through the city beneath. The empire’s reach now extended far beyond the reformed ruins of post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto, but Hiashi’s world had narrowed to this singular point—a precipice between power and peace. “Hiashi-sama,” intoned a voice behind him, shattering the meditative silence. Tatsuo, his loyal lieutenant stepped forward, his posture rigid with news he bore. “The Meta Liberation Army... it's finished. The Empire’s Armed Detectives wasted no mercy. Quirks like ours—they're enforcing registration and regulation.” Hiashi's countenance was as unreadable as the darkened sky. “And the Emperor... what is his decree for those like us who hide in the shadows?” “An amnesty—for those who surrender. A purge for resistors.” Tatsuo's words spilled out reluctantly. A sardonic curve touched Hiashi’s lips. “Then it's time I disband this mirage,” he mused, his gaze finding the sprawling metropolis anew. “Power—I’ve held it in the palm of my hand, enough to warp the bones of the world. Yet now, it falls to others to shape the order.” He turned away from the edge, facing Tatsuo squarely—the signal of a final order. “Dismantle our networks. Launder the assets. As of this night, All for One... will be no more.” Tatsuo’s eyes widened. “Hiashi-sama, what will become of you? And your dream?” “A dream dreamt in darkness can be a vile thing. The Empire has unveiled a different path—hope in the sunlight.” Hiashi's silhouette melded with the city lights as he descended from the heights. *** Months passed, and with meticulous care, Hiashi nurtured the guise of legitimacy—a businessman with philanthropic enterprises born overnight, laundering his hoard with deft precision. He frequented circles of influence, donning the façade of societal charm, his past obscured by philanthropy and burgeoning bureaucratic bonds. At a charity ball, adorned with imperial grandiosity, he chanced upon her—Inko. A woman with a quiet smile and eyes that spoke of gentle mysteries. Despite his well-versed cunning, Hiashi found something disarmingly sincere in her gaze. A genuine kindness that stirred an unnamed longing within. Inko was joyfully unabashed, speaking of dreams taken flight—hers to be a mother, to nurture a soul who could love this harsh, reformed world. Hiashi, the man who once shaped destinies, found himself ensnared by the simple purity of her vision. With each encounter, the magnate’s mask slipped, revealing glimpses of Hiashi—the man who yearned for absolution. Inko saw not the façade, but the cracks through which his truest self shone. She fell for the enigma, the quiet strength, the sense of a soul seeking redemption. “I was never one for heroes, Inko,” Hiashi murmured one twilight, the dwindling rays gilding her auburn hair. “But perhaps your dream could be mine as well.” And so, through the labyrinthine complexity of geopolitical upheaval—a world of IS units and Tactical Surface Fighters clashing with chakra and Quirks—a simple truth endured: Hiashi’s love for Inko, an anchor in a shifting age. Midoriya Izuku would be born, not of the underworld, but of the gentle bond between two souls finding light in the dusk of a long-forgotten empire."},{"prompt":"Write the plot of a historical fiction in which a samurai from japan ends up in aztec territoty","completion":"Title: The Samurai and the Sun Stone Plot: In the year 1582, in the Sengoku period of Japan, a loyal and fearsome samurai named Takeshi serves his daimyo with unwavering commitment. When a bitter rival clan attacks Takeshi's lord, he fights with honor and might but is ultimately outmaneuvered and forced to retreat to the coast. As a final act of defiance, Takeshi steals an enemy vessel and sets sail, vowing to return and restore his master's honor. The sea proves to be an even more treacherous enemy, and a powerful storm casts Takeshi adrift across the vast Pacific Ocean. With his supplies dwindling and his spirit beginning to falter, he stumbles upon uncharted lands, a world away from his home. He washes ashore in a strange and vibrant land that future generations will know as Mesoamerica, specifically within the expanse of the Aztec Empire. Struggling to survive in an unfamiliar terrain and amidst an alien culture, Takeshi encounters a small village on the outskirts of Tenochtitlán. He is met with both awe and suspicion by the Aztecs, who perceive him as an emissary of their feathered-serpent god, Quetzalcoatl, due to his armor and foreign appearance. Takeshi is introduced to the local language and traditions by a kind-hearted priest named Yaotl, who becomes his guide and confidant. Takeshi's samurai skills soon garner the attention of the Aztec emperor, who is waging a war against rival tribes. Seeking to take advantage of Takeshi's prowess in battle, the emperor enlists him as a warrior. Takeshi agrees, hoping to gain a position of influence and find a way back to his homeland. He trains the Aztec warriors in the way of the samurai, melding their fighting styles into a formidable force. As Takeshi becomes more entwined with Aztec society, he encounters a wise and compassionate noblewoman named Xochitl. She teaches him about the Aztec customs, their sophisticated astronomy, and the ominous prophecies that forecast the end of their world. Moved by her passion and the vibrant culture of the Aztecs, Takeshi finds his loyalty torn between his samurai code and the people who have accepted him. When Takeshi uncovers a sinister plot by a faction within the empire to usurp the throne and throw the realm into chaos, he must use all his cunning and samurai training to thwart the coup. In a climactic confrontation at the foot of the great pyramid, amidst the shadow of a solar eclipse, Takeshi battles against the traitors, guided by the art of war and an unexpected allegiance to his new comrades. Takeshi's journey becomes a legend whispered in the streets of Tenochtitlán—a tale of a warrior from a distant land who crossed an ocean of stars to stand with the Aztecs against the unknown. As he carves a place for himself in Aztec history, Takeshi discovers that honor and home are not bound by borders but are where the heart finds its place among people who accept and value one's spirit. In \\"The Samurai and the Sun Stone,\\" Takeshi's odyssey is woven into the tapestry of Aztec civilization at the cusp of change, a poignant reminder that even the most profound barriers can be bridged through understanding, respect, and the universal language of courage."},{"prompt":"Write an anime scene about a young man having a odd dream.

His longish hair flutters softly, strands of sunshine lighting up his gentle, boyish face. In place of his usual unassuming attire, Yuji is now clad in form-fitting daisy dukes paired with a playful short-sleeve shirt, knotted just above his slender waist. He regards himself with a mix of confusion and amusement, unable to reconcile this lumberjack persona with his usual reserved self. Yuji struts around playfully, his hips swaying with a flirty confidence unbecoming of his regular demeanor. Dream Yuji (to himself, with a playful wink): \\"Oh, aren’t you just the cutest lumberjack in the forest?\\" With a dramatic flip of an imaginary glossy mane, Dream Yuji gets to work. He slides his goggles on with a seductive smile, ensuring they sit just right over his eyes. Next, he secures the earmuffs over his ears, taking extra care not to smudge the cherry red lipstick he applied with a precision that had no place in a logging site. He flexes his fingers inside his fitted work gloves, feeling the snugness against his skin.

He sits on the edge of the bed, amused yet bewildered by the vividness of his lumberjack escapade—every suggestive pose, every swivel of those daisy dukes stark in his mind's eye. He chuckles to himself as he tugs at his real shirt, decidedly untied and far less daring. In the tranquility of his bedroom, the echo of the dream feels like an odd secret, wrapped in the morning light.

It follows the teachings of the Isma'il, the seventh imam in their lineage, from whom they derive their name. Isma'ilis give allegiance to the Aga Khan as their living imam, who they believe is a direct descendant of Prophet Muhammad and provides guidance on spiritual and worldly matters. With a global presence, Isma'ilism emphasizes pluralism, education, and social development while integrating esoteric thought within Islamic practices."},{"prompt":"Is DAESH a Sunni or Shi'a?","completion":"DAESH, also known as ISIS or the Islamic State, is a radical militant group that emerged from a Sunni background. It adheres to an extremist interpretation of Sunni Islam, although its ideology and actions are widely denounced by mainstream Sunni scholars and communities worldwide. The group has been responsible for numerous acts of terrorism and has targeted a variety of groups, including Shi'a Muslims, whom they consider heretics."},{"prompt":"What are the differences between Jaʿfari, Ismāʿīlī, and Zaydī sects of Shi'a Islam?","completion":"Ja'fari, Ismā'īlī, and Zaydī represent three distinct sects within Shi'a Islam, each with its own unique beliefs and jurisprudence. **Ja'fari** (also known as Twelver Shi'ism): - This sect is the largest branch of Shi'a Islam. - Adherents believe in a succession of twelve Imams, with the twelfth Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, believed to be in occultation and expected to return as the Mahdi, or guided one. - Their jurisprudence, or fiqh, is known as Ja'fari jurisprudence. **Ismā'īlī**: - This branch is named after Imam Isma'il ibn Jafar, whom they consider the rightful successor to Jafar al-Sadiq, in contrast to the Twelvers who follow his brother Musa al-Kadhim. - Ismā'īlīs have a complex theological framework that includes a spiritual interpretation of the Quran. - They follow a living Imam, the Aga Khan, as the present and continuous guide in the Imamate lineage. **Zaydī**: - This sect is named after Zayd ibn Ali, the grandson of Husayn ibn Ali, and is prevalent in Yemen. - Zaydīs are less strict in their beliefs regarding the Imamate, requiring that the Imam be a descendant of Ali and Fatimah but also that he actively rise up against oppression and tyranny. - Their jurisprudence is distinct from the Ja'fari and Ismā'īlī and can be described as somewhat closer to Sunni jurisprudence in some aspects. While these sects share some core beliefs of Shi'a Islam, including the allegiance to Ali as the first Imam, their practices, theological principles, and interpretations of Islamic jurisprudence differ significantly."},{"prompt":"What does jurisprudence mean? Both in Islam and outside of Islam?","completion":"Jurisprudence, in a general sense, refers to the theory or philosophy of law and the systematic study of legal principles and the structure of legal systems. It encompasses various schools of thought on how laws should be interpreted, applied, and developed. Within the context of Islamic tradition, jurisprudence, known as \\"fiqh,\\" is the human understanding and application of the Sharia, or Islamic law, based on the Quran and Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad). Islamic jurisprudence covers rituals, personal conduct, and legal matters, ranging from marriage and inheritance to criminal offenses. Various Islamic schools of jurisprudence (madhhab) exist, with differences in methodology and legal rulings reflecting diverse interpretations among scholars."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between a denomination and a sect?","completion":"In religious contexts, \\"denomination\\" and \\"sect\\" often refer to subordinate groups within a larger faith tradition, but they carry different connotations: **Denomination:** - Typically used to describe a recognized, often mainstream, branch of a larger religion that has its own unique practices, organizational structure, and doctrines but still maintains a significant degree of commonality with other branches within the same religion. - Denominations usually coexist relatively peacefully and acknowledge each other's legitimacy. - Examples include Methodists, Baptists, and Lutherans within Christianity. **Sect:** - Often conveys a group that has broken away from the mainstream or larger religion due to distinct doctrinal differences or disagreements over leadership. - Sects can sometimes be seen as more radical or non-conformist, and may be formed after a schism. - They might assert a stronger claim to authenticity or purity in their practices and beliefs. - An example could be the different sects in Shi'a Islam, such as Isma'ilis or Zaydis, that have specific theological and leadership differences from mainstream Twelver Shi'ism. While these terms are useful for distinguishing between types of religious groupings, their usage can vary by context and the self-identification of the groups themselves. It's important to note the fluidity and subjectivity in how these terms are applied."},{"prompt":"What is the largest and most popular sect of Sunni Islam?","completion":"Sunni Islam does not have sects in the same way that Shia Islam does; instead, it has different schools of legal thought, known as \\"madhhabs.\\" These schools differ mainly in methodology and legal interpretation but share the core beliefs of Sunni Islam. The four major Sunni madhhabs are: 1. **Hanafi**: The largest of the Sunni schools, prevalent in South Asia, Turkey, the Balkans, and parts of the Arab world. 2. **Maliki**: Dominant in North and West Africa and some parts of the Arab world. 3. **Shafi'i**: Commonly practiced in East Africa, Southeast Asia, and parts of the Arab Peninsula. 4. **Hanbali**: The smallest in number, found primarily in the Arabian Peninsula, notably in Saudi Arabia. While these schools have their own legal traditions, Sunnis are generally less rigid about madhhab adherence and often follow more than one school for different aspects of sharia law. There is no singular \\"sect\\" of Sunni Islam that is considered the largest or most popular; rather, Sunnis collectively represent the majority within Islam, with the Hanafi school perhaps being the most followed among them."},{"prompt":"What are the major tenants of Hanafi?","completion":"The Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence, founded by Imam Abu Hanifa (699–767 CE), is known for its intellectual rigor and reliance on reasoning. Major tenets of the Hanafi school include: 1. **Emphasis on Reason and Ijtihad**: The Hanafi school places significant emphasis on human reason and the exercise of independent analytical judgment (ijtihad) by qualified scholars when the Qur'an and Hadith do not provide clear guidance on an issue. 2. **Use of Qiyas (Analogical Reasoning)**: When direct textual evidence from the Qur'an and Hadith is not available, Hanafi jurisprudence often relies on qiyas, where a ruling for a new issue is developed by drawing analogies with the closest comparable matter outlined in the religious texts. 3. **Priority of Practices of the People of Medina**: The actions and practices of the people of Medina during the time of Prophet Muhammad are considered of high importance and can be used in understanding how to apply Islamic principles. 4. **Role of Custom (Urf)**: Hanafi jurists give considerable weight to local customs and practices, provided they do not openly contradict Islamic principles, recognizing the flexibility and adaptability of Shariah in different cultural contexts. 5. **Sources of Law**: The primary sources of Hanafi law are the Qur'an and Hadith, followed by consensus (ijma), analogical reasoning (qiyas), and then secondary sources like juristic preference (istihsan), the principle of consideration of public welfare (maslahah mursalah), and customs (urf). 6. **Approach to Hadith**: The Hanafi school is somewhat more cautious in the acceptance of Hadith, prioritizing narrations well-established through numerous reliable transmission chains and those that correspond with established legal reasoning. The Hanafi madhhab is notable for its flexibility and openness to new ideas, which has contributed to its widespread adoption across diverse Muslim communities globally, particularly in non-Arab regions such as South Asia and parts of the Middle East, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe."},{"prompt":"As the Harrison Armory (LANCER TTRPG) military administrator, you are to decide if the following is worth colonizing, as well as, your thoughts, reasons, and actions on/for denying or accepting on colonizing the following planet. The planet, designated SERPULO (Not any form of abbreviation), is spore-ridden planet laying roughly 250 light years away, although with our (Worm holes, blink, warp, tachyon, etc.) technology, we could get there in just a couple of days. The planet has been analyzed by scouting probes, which discovered extreme amounts of titanium and palladium. The spores that infest SERPULO are extremely fast germinating, result in massive spore storms, seemed to be able to be turned to a form of energy source when burned. Any fires don't last long because of the high humidity on SERPULO. This humidity resulted in a dense fog of water vapor, almost holding the spores in mid-air as if it seemed like it was floating.","completion":"As the military administrator of Harrison Armory, it is my duty to consider not only the strategic and economic benefits of colonizing a new planet but also the potential risks and the tactical implications of establishing a base of operations on such a planet. Given the information provided about SERPULO, there are several key factors to weigh: **Pros:** 1. **Resource Abundance**: The presence of titanium and palladium is highly advantageous. Titanium's strength-to-weight ratio makes it exceptionally valuable for constructing LANCER mech chassis and armor plating, while palladium's catalytic properties and use in electronics make it a critical resource for technology. 2. **Energy Potential**: The fact that the spores can be utilized as an energy source when burned indicates a potential for a self-sustaining energy supply, which could be beneficial for long-term colonization and operations. 3. **Strategic Position**: Being 250 light years away but accessible via advanced FTL travel places SERPULO in a position that could be strategically important, depending on its location relative to other systems of interest. **Cons:** 1. **Environmental Challenges**: The spore storms and dense fog indicate that SERPULO's environment is hostile. Constant vigilance and mitigation strategies would have to be maintained to ensure safe operations and the well-being of colonists and troops. 2. **Spore Properties**: Without a thorough understanding of the biological nature and potential hazards of the planet's spores—such as their impact on human health and infrastructure—there's a risk of unforeseeable complications. The spores could be toxic, corrosive, or even possess properties that could damage equipment or infect personnel. 3. **Cost of Colonization**: Establishing a base on SERPULO would require substantial investment in infrastructure that can resist spore damage, as well as constant maintenance to keep the environment safe for humans and machines alike. **Decision and Action Plan:** Based on these considerations, I propose a cautious, phased approach to the potential colonization of SERPULO: 1. **Detailed Analysis**: Commission a detailed biological study of the spores and their potential impact on human health and machinery. Any colonization effort should be preceded by thorough risk assessments and the creation of protocols to deal with the spore storms. 2. **Feasibility Study and Tech Development**: Initiate a feasibility study for the development of specialized habitats and systems to counteract the spore-related risks. This could include sealed environments, advanced filtration systems, spore-resistant materials, and drones or robots capable of operating outside human-safe zones. 3. **Strategic Positioning and Defense**: Evaluate the strategic importance of SERPULO within the broader political and military landscape of the galaxy. If deemed valuable, consider establishing a forward operating base with a focus on defense and rapid response capabilities. 4. **Resource Extraction**: If the hazards posed by the spores can be managed, proceed with a limited mining operation for titanium and palladium, possibly using remotely operated or automated systems to minimize human risk. 5. **Energy Exploitation**: If the spores can indeed be used as an energy source, develop the means to harness this energy safely, potentially leading to an energy production facility that could support the colony and military operations. 6. **Gradual Expansion**: Only after the initial operations prove successful and sustainable should larger-scale colonization be considered. Maintain a continuous review process to ensure environmental and health standards are not compromised. The potential gains from harnessing SERPULO's resources and the strategic advantage it may offer are significant. However, because the safety and security of Harrison Armory personnel and assets are paramount, a cautious approach is the prudent course of action. Only with a full understanding of the risks and a comprehensive strategy to mitigate them can SERPULO be responsibly colonized."},{"prompt":"Here's some extra information. Change, expand, or add information accordingly. The spores seem to be able to turn non-biological metals/matrials, such as coal, energy-dense lithium, energy-dense magnesium, etc, into energy. The spores have unknown effects on humans or any known biological materials.","completion":"With the additional information that the spores have the ability to convert non-biological materials into energy, this considerably enhances the potential value of SERPULO as a source of energy. However, the uncertainty regarding their effects on biological materials, including humans, adds a layer of risk that cannot be ignored. **Revised Decision and Action Plan:** 1. **Intensified Biological and Material Analysis**: The revelation that the spores have the capacity to interact with and convert non-biological materials into energy necessitates an urgent and comprehensive series of studies. A dedicated team of xenobiologists, material scientists, and energy specialists should be assembled to analyze the spores' mechanisms of action, assess any potential risks, and explore the possibilities for harnessing this unique bioenergetic process. 2. **Containment Protocols**: Given the unknown effects of the spores on biological matter, the development of robust containment protocols is critical. These protocols should include the design of sealed environmental suits for personnel, the creation of biohazard containment facilities, and the establishment of quarantine procedures for any material—organic or inorganic—that comes in contact with the spores. 3. **Non-Biological Material Conversion Exploration**: Explore the potential for using non-biological materials as feedstock for energy generation via the spores, potentially setting up SERPULO as a substantial energy hub for Harrison Armory. However, caution must be exercised to prevent any unintended reactions that could result from the spore-material interaction, including explosive or corrosive outcomes. 4. **Infrastructure and Habitat Development**: Infrastructure development must prioritize safety against spore exposure. Habitats and operation centers will require advanced airlocks, filtration and ventilation systems, as well as emergency protocols for containment breaches. Additionally, structures may need to be built with specialized materials that are resistant to spore-induced conversion. 5. **Remote Handling Systems**: Given the unknown interactions with biological matter, the initiation of mining and energy production operations should deploy remote handling systems and robotics. This would minimize human exposure until more is known about the physiological effects of the spores. 6. **Environmental Monitoring**: Implement an extensive environmental monitoring regime to study spore behavior, patterns, and interactions with the planet's ecosystem. This information will be crucial for predicting spore storms and protecting both personnel and machinery. 7. **Medical Research**:** Commission a medical research task force to study the possible effects of spores on humans and other biological organisms. This should include both in vivo and in vitro experiments under the safest possible conditions. Understanding any potential pathogenicity or toxicity is a top priority before any human presence is established on SERPULO. 8. **Military Readiness**: Given the potential for bioenergetic spores to potentially interfere with equipment, military hardware will likely need to be adapted or shielded against spore exposure. Defensive strategies should also be developed to protect against any biological warfare applications by potential adversaries interested in the spores' unique properties. 9. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Consult with legal and ethics committees regarding the exploitation of a potentially sentient or otherwise protected form of life—the spores themselves. Ensure that actions comply with any applicable treaties and ethical guidelines related to xenobiological exploitation. Ultimately, my revised decision still rests on a phased approach, though with a much greater emphasis on safety and research before any full-scale colonization efforts. The unique properties of SERPULO's spores offer considerable opportunities for both energy production and the potential development of novel technologies, but these must be pursued with a high degree of caution to safeguard human life and the integrity of Harrison Armory's assets and reputation."},{"prompt":"The spores seem to be able to turn non-biological metals/materials with an \\"adequate\\" (Unknown exact amount) potential energy output to energy to be used as a \\"food\\" source.

Any revisions.","completion":"With the added complexity of AI machinery and their non-human origin, the situation on SERPULO is now not just a case of harnessing resources but potentially dealing with extraterrestrial intelligence and technology. This raises significant concerns about security, sovereignty, and even diplomacy, depending on the nature and intentions of the entities that created the machinery. **Further Revised Decision and Action Plan:** 1. **Extraterrestrial Technology Assessment**: Categorize and assess the AI machinery for potential threats and technologies that could be acquired or reverse-engineered. This should be done by a specialized reconnaissance team equipped with the appropriate countermeasures and defensive systems. 2. **Non-Interference and Observation**: Until more is known about the AI and its origins, a strict policy of non-interference should be enacted. Observe the AI machinery from a safe distance to understand its operational patterns, potential aggressiveness, and objectives. 3. **Communication Efforts**: Investigate if the machinery is capable of communication. Set up a first-contact team well-versed in xenolinguistics and artificial intelligence that can attempt to establish dialogue or at least understand any signals being transmitted or received by the satellite arrays. 4. **Locate Relay Source**: Assign a specialist team to locate and analyze the source of the AI machinery's relay transmissions. If it is of extraterrestrial origin, this could potentially lead to first contact with an alien civilization, which must be handled with extreme caution and within the protocols for such encounters. 5. **Revised Military Posture**: Maintain a covert military presence capable of defense and offensive action if necessary. The presence of combat machinery suggests the possibility of hostilities, which Harrison Armory must be prepared for. 6. **Non-Human Origin Protocols**: Develop protocols for handling non-human technology which may have unknown capabilities or safety issues. Ensure any interaction with the AI machinery is done so in a way that prevents contamination, technological malfunctions, or inadvertent hostility. 7. **Cybersecurity Measures**: Since the machinery is AI-driven, assess any potential cybersecurity threats they may pose to human technology. Establish a firewall to protect Armory systems from potential hacking or other cyber-attacks by the AI machinery. 8. **Spore-Machinery Interaction**: Investigate how the spores interact with the AI machinery, especially since they have the ability to convert non-biological materials into energy. There could be a symbiotic relationship or perhaps a control mechanism that utilizes the spore energy conversion capability. 9. **Containment and Quarantine**: Due to the unknown properties of the AI machinery and the spores, strict containment and quarantine procedures should be enacted for any items or personnel returning from the planet. Analysis should take place in isolated labs equipped to deal with potential biohazards or technological hazards. In light of these additional complexities, colonization efforts should be postponed until it is clear whether the AI presence poses a threat or opportunity. The Armory's response must be multidisciplinary, involving military strategists, scientists, diplomats, and cybersecurity experts to ensure that any action taken is informed by a comprehensive understanding of the potential risks and benefits. Caution is paramount, as there may be significant implications for the broader strategic landscape, especially if a new alien presence is confirmed."},{"prompt":"Generate a LANCER TTRPG campaign, this campaign mostly takes place on SERPELO.

It is a type of deep learning model aimed at generating high-quality images from textual descriptions. The approach utilizes a variety of techniques, including denoising diffusion probabilistic models, to gradually transform patterns of random noise into coherent images that correspond to the text input it receives. Stable Diffusion often refers to models and techniques that enable the generation of such images in a manner that is stable during the training process and capable of producing consistent, high-fidelity results. These models are built and trained on large datasets of images and their associated textual descriptions, allowing them to learn a wide range of visual styles and concepts. As of my last update in early 2023, this area is quite active with ongoing research and development, and applications of these models are becoming more prevalent in the fields of computer graphics, design assistance, and as a tool for artists and creators. It's important to note that AI-generated images should be used responsibly, considering ethical implications and the rights of individuals and creators."},{"prompt":"Is there a certain way to write prompts to get a full size image of a girl, no cut offs?","completion":"When you're working with text-to-image models like those based on Stable Diffusion or other similar frameworks, getting a full body shot with no cut-offs is partly a matter of writing clear, specific prompts and understanding how the model interprets instructions. Here are some tips for crafting prompts to generate a full-size image of a girl with no cut-offs: 1. **Be Explicit**: Include specific instructions in your prompt. For example, \\"full-length portrait of a girl standing,\\" which signals that you want to see the entire body. 2. **Detail Positioning**: Use terms like \\"centered,\\" \\"full view,\\" or \\"entire figure visible\\" to emphasize that you expect no parts to be cropped out. 3. **Aspect Ratio**: If the platform allows it, specify an aspect ratio that is conducive to full-body images, like 3:4 or a similar portrait orientation, to reduce the likelihood of horizontal cropping. 4. **Background Instructions**: Providing background detail can encourage the model to generate an environment that fits a full body. For example, \\"a girl standing in an open field with clear skies behind her.\\" 5. **Avoid Ambiguity**: Steer clear of vague descriptors that might give the model room for interpretation in a way that could lead to cropping. 6. **Check Examples and Forums**: Look at successful full-body images generated by the community and see how their prompts are structured. Communities often share tips on best practices in prompt engineering. 7. **Iterate on Successful Prompts**: If you achieve the desired result with a certain prompt, use variations of it to create similar images in the future. It's important to note that these models learn from datasets, which may have biases or limitations. If full-body images are less common in the training data, the model might be less adept at generating them. Additionally, despite careful prompting, generative models can still return unexpected results, so some trial and error may be necessary. Lastly, when using AI to generate images of people, be mindful of ethical considerations and the potential consequences of generating sensitive content. Ensure you are respecting privacy and the rights of individuals when creating and using such images."},{"prompt":"Ok, write 3 prompts for a full height image of a girl with blue eyes, wearing a dress, realistic. soft light, very detailed, anatomically correct","completion":"Certainly! Here are three example prompts that include specific details for generating an image of a girl with blue eyes, wearing a dress, with soft lighting, high detail, and anatomical accuracy using a text-to-image model: 1. \\"Generate an ultra-high-resolution, anatomically precise, full-length image of a young woman with striking blue eyes. She is standing in a relaxed pose, centered in the frame on a neutral background. She is adorned with an elegant, flowing dress that reaches her ankles.

She is dressed in a vintage-inspired, knee-length dress that complements her eyes. The image is taken in a studio setting with soft, natural light streaming in to accentuate the fine textures of her dress and the subtle details of her hair and features. The composition is balanced, ensuring nothing is cut off, with attention to anatomical correctness and visual harmony.\\" 3. \\"Craft a photorealistic, full-size illustration of a girl with crystal blue eyes, standing in a sunlit garden. Her full-height form is elegantly presented in a summer dress with delicate patterns, with no crops or cut-offs. The soft, warm light of the golden hour enhances the intricate details of her attire and the natural beauty of her face, ensuring accurate anatomy and lifelike representation down to the finest detail.\\" Remember that these models may produce a range of results, and the quality and accuracy can vary with the chosen model, its training data, and current capabilities. You might need to refine your prompt or make multiple attempts to get the desired outcome."},{"prompt":"Best option was number 3, but still it only shows the bust size image, not a full height one","completion":"If you're consistently receiving images that only show a bust-size view rather than full height, you may need to further refine the prompt to emphasize the full body aspect, or, if possible, adjust the settings of the AI model to better suit full-body images. Here's an attempt to adjust the prompt to be more specific about the full height requirement: \\"Please generate a detailed, lifelike full-height portrait of a girl with luminous blue eyes, ensuring her entire figure is visible from head to toe. She stands amidst a garden, the soft sunlight of early evening casting gentle illumination over her. She is clothed in a long, flowing dress with a hem that touches the ground, fitting comfortably in the portrait's vertical frame without any part being cut off. The image should capture her from a distance that ensures her full stature is displayed, accentuating her poised stance and providing a realistic representation that is anatomically accurate.\\" When using AI models, if the platform allows, check if there are any additional settings or parameters that specify the image composition, like “full-body,” “full-length,” or “vertical orientation.” Some platforms also allow you to input aspect ratios or resolutions that may help guide the AI towards generating a full-height image instead of a cropped one. The capabilities and limitations of the model you're using could also affect the outcome. If you're still facing difficulties, consider providing the AI model with examples of full-height portraits as references if the platform supports this type of input. This can often help guide the model more effectively than text alone. If these methods still do not yield the full-height image you’re after, it might be a limitation within the model itself, its training data, or the need for more advanced prompt engineering. It can also be helpful to look at community forums or support resources specific to the AI platform you're using for additional tips tailored to that particular model or service."},{"prompt":"Please write a prompt that has all possible words to make it full height image for a girl","completion":"Creating a prompt with all possible descriptive terms to ensure a full-body image might not be necessary or helpful, as too much detail can sometimes confuse the model or lead to unexpected results. The key is to be clear and explicit about your requirements without overloading the prompt. Here's a streamlined yet explicit prompt: \\"Create a detailed, photorealistic image capturing the full height of a girl from head to toe, ensuring that no part of her figure is cropped or cut off. She has captivating blue eyes and is wearing an elegant, long dress that reaches the ground. The portrait orientation of the image should frame her centrally, providing a clear, unobstructed view of her entire body with equal space above her head and below her feet. Use soft, natural lighting to enhance the realism and showcase fine details clearly, from the texture of the dress to the precise anatomical structure of her form.\\" Remember to set the aspect ratio to a portrait orientation (if the option is available), as landscape orientations often crop the image horizontally. If your initial attempts do not produce a full-height image, consider adjusting the ratio or making additional specifications within the platform's parameters or advanced settings."},{"prompt":"what are the best aspect ratios?","completion":"When you aim to produce a full-height or full-length image of a subject, such as a portrait of a person, the best aspect ratios are typically those that are taller than they are wide — known as portrait orientations. Here are some commonly used aspect ratios for full-height images: 1. **3:4 or 4:3** - Classic portrait orientation, suitable for single subjects and provides a good amount of space vertically. 2. **9:16 or 16:9** - This is the aspect ratio commonly used for smartphone screens and is great for full-body images when used in portrait mode (9:16). It's quite tall, making it excellent for ensuring full-length views are captured. 3. **2:3 or 3:2** - Another traditional format for portraits, used often in photography, providing a slightly narrower field than 3:4. 4. **1:1.618 (Golden Ratio)** - Although not a typical choice for full body portraits, it is aesthetically pleasing and can be effective if the subject matter aligns well with this proportion. 5. **5:7 or 7:5** - Also used in portrait photography, offering a balance between the height and width that can fit a full-body shot comfortably. 6. **Custom Taller Ratios** - Depending on the system you are using, you might even have the option to specify a custom aspect ratio. For example, something like 1:2, which is very tall and could be ideal for showcasing a single, stand-alone subject in full. It's important to select an aspect ratio that aligns with the intended composition and format of the image. For instance, if you want a full-body shot that includes some background for context, then choosing a slightly wider aspect ratio might be beneficial. Conversely, for a focus solely on the subject without much background, a narrower, taller aspect ratio could be better. Please note that some text-to-image AI generation platforms may have presets or recommend specific aspect ratios based on the subject matter and desired outcome. Always refer to the guidelines or recommendations of the platform you are using for the best results."},{"prompt":"which aspect ratio is the best for a full height images :width × height 704×1408 ∣ 1:2 704×1344 ∣ 11:21 768×1344 ∣ 4:7 768×1280 ∣ 3:5 832×1216 ∣ 13:19 832×1152 ∣ 13:18 896×1152 ∣ 7:9 896×1088 ∣ 14:17 960×1088 ∣ 15:17 960×1024 ∣ 15:16 1024×1024 ∣ 1:1 1024×960 ∣ 16:15 1088×960 ∣ 17:15 1088×896 ∣ 17:14 1152×896 ∣ 9:7 1152×832 ∣ 18:13 1216×832 ∣ 19:13 1280×768 ∣ 5:3 1344×768 ∣ 7:4 1344×704 ∣ 21:11 1408×704 ∣ 2:1 1472×704 ∣ 23:11 1536×640 ∣ 12:5 1600×640 ∣ 5:2 1664×576 ∣ 26:9 1728×576 ∣ 3:1","completion":"For full-height images where you want to capture a portrait-oriented full body shot of an individual without cropping any part of their figure, taller aspect ratios generally work best. Among the options you've listed, the ones with a greater height relative to width would generally be the most suitable. Here are some of the best choices from your list: 1. **704×1408 | 1:2** - This is a very tall and narrow ratio, ideal for full-length portraits where you want to capture significant vertical detail. 2. **704×1344 | 11:21** - Quite similar to the 1:2 ratio and also very suitable for full-height images. 3. **768×1280 | 3:5** - This ratio is less extreme than 1:2 and provides a good amount of vertical space while being slightly wider, which can be helpful if a little more context around the subject is desired. 4. **832×1216 | 13:19** - This one is pretty close to 3:4 and should offer a nice balance for portraits. The exact choice can depend on the specific requirements of the image you want to generate, such as whether you want more or less background, if you want to emphasize the height of the subject, or if you're considering a particular framing that includes additional elements besides the focal figure. Aspect ratios such as **5:3 (1280×768)** and above start to become wider and may not be as ideal for full-height portraits since they offer less vertical space relative to their width, which can increase the risk of parts of the subject being cropped out. Ultimately, **704×1408 | 1:2** will likely be the best fit for a full-height image with the intent of no crops or cut-offs of the figure. This should ensure that the entire length of the subject is visible within the frame.

Antique tapestries lined the walls, adorned with the heraldry of the newly established Ōtsutsuki Empire. This was his quiet refuge from a world bristling with post-apocalyptic tension and the birthplace of a new Japanese Empire. Inko's soft voice broke the silence, carrying weight behind her sincere curiosity. \\"What made you leave it all behind, Hiashi?

But the encroaching dominance of the Ōtsutsuki over our lands has rewritten the rules. They possess power the likes of which our world has never seen, blending ancient strength with technological marvels. There's no room for the villainy of old among such might.\\" As their conversation deepened, the echo of distant martial clangs and roaring engines bled through the walls, a testament to the Ōtsutsuki's martial prowess. Outside, Century Armaments stood ready beside Tactical Surface Fighters, patrolled by Quirk users and pyrokinetic warriors. This was the reality of the empire's show of force. Inko's gaze softened, seeing the genuine transformation within Hiashi. \\"And in this new epoch, where does your heart lie?\\" Hiashi met her gaze, his resolve as clear as the polished katana displayed in the corner. \\"With you, Inko, and our future. I wish to be a man worthy of your love, and a father who paves a path of integrity for our son.\\" A silence enveloped them then, one of understanding and the shared sentiment of two souls converging amidst the chaos of a redefined world.

The clang of steel and thrumming chakra pulsed far from this quiet chamber where destiny unfolded in whispers. Hiashi leaned against the window frame, Tokyo's sprawling metropolis at his feet—a symphony of neon and noise. He watched as Century Armaments patrolled alongside crimson-clad Armed Detectives, safeguarding the night with unmatched vigilance. Quirk users infused with Diva spirits cascaded across the skies, their duties now aligned with the Ōtsutsuki vision of order. Inko, the woman who had unraveled the enigma of his soul, sat across the antique kotatsu. Her emerald eyes fixed on his, finding truth in the depths of his repentant gaze. \\"I've witnessed the erasure of the Meta Liberation Army,\\" Hiashi began, his voice a resonant calm, \\"and with it, the end of an era where 'All for One' loomed like the harbinger of a darker age.\\" Inko listened, her heart entwining with his confessions, her love unshaken by the shadows of his past. \\"Hiashi,\\" Inko murmured, her fingers gingerly touching the surface of the wooden table, \\"What matters is who you are now—the man who stands before me, whose dreams for peace align with our Emperor's promise.\\" He offered her a half-smile, the warmth breaking through his cold facade. \\"To leave a legacy not of fear, but of harmony, to give Izuku a world that knows the gentle hand of balance,\\" Hiashi admitted, the man behind 'All for One' revealing the shards of his once fractured humanity. \\"In our restructured Kyoto, under the reign of the Ōtsutsuki and the restored glory of the Masaki dynasty, you have been key in shaping this era,\\" Inko continued, her belief in him strengthening his resolve. Transitioning from the underworld to the overworld had been like breathing life into a dying star. He had once mastered the dance of shadows to orchestrate power from behind the veil—an All for One among none. But now, Hiashi saw before him a new dance, an intricate web of military precision and chakra prowess that redefined strength. The Tactical Surface Fighters became their titans, their fists against the tumultuous world beyond. The IS units served as their valiant Valkyries, warding off threats from the unfathomable depths of space. And within the Armed Detective framework, the shinobi instincts adapted, now turned to the safeguarding of a nation reborn from its feudal and cataclysmic shackles. Hiashi rose, his gaze drifting to the Sword of Jurai, mounted and forever alight with power eternal. He approached the relic, fingers hovering but never daring to touch its venerable edge. There was no need for such weapons in his hands any longer. \\"Inko,\\" he said, turning back with a resolve etched into every feature, \\"Let us forge a future for Izuku where the old ways of villainy are but tales of what was overcome. Where the heroes... are simply those who rise each morning to rebuild, respect, and revive.\\" She joined him by the window. Together, they gazed out upon the Neo-Edo skyline—where ancient myths, futuristic warriors, and immortal clans converged into one pulse, one nation, one destiny that bridged worlds and times immemorial. In that tranquil room, where the daunting road ahead seemed filled with the promise of days unmarred by the shadows of All for One, Hiashi knew true peace was more than a stolen Quirk—it was the legacy he would build with Inko, for Izuku, and for all who would come after."},{"prompt":"Write an anime scene about a young man having a odd dream.

DUSKY FOREST - DAY (DREAM SEQUENCE) The camera drifts through the rich emerald tapestry of a dense forest. Birds are chirping while rays of the morning sun gently pierce the canopy. CUT TO: A YOUNG MAN, slight of build with androgynous, girly features, is adjusting his goggles in front of a reflective surface of a small pond. He clearly stands out in this rugged environment with his boyish charm. His short-sleeve red plaid shirt, tied in a neat knot just above his navel, and daisy dukes underscore his flirty demeanor. He smiles at his reflection, winks, and puckers up as he applies a vibrant shade of lipstick - a stark contrast to the natural surroundings. He looks down, focusing on his gloves - checking they fit just right - they are worn but seem to perfectly mold to his slender hands. His smirk suggests he's ready for action, an odd mix of sultriness and determination in his eyes. He strides confidently with deliberate steps towards the grand, aged trees, his steel-toed boots crunching over the forest floor. He's carrying a large, somewhat out-of-place, chainsaw, its weight causing his slender frame to sway. His movements are almost comical in their exaggerated carefulness. The chainsaw ROARS to life, its mechanical growl drowning out the forest’s melody. He raises it with surprising ease and approaches a sizable trunk. EXTREME CLOSE-UP on his face. He's focused, but flirts with danger - there's a twinkle in his eyes as wood chips start to fly. The environment and the task at hand seem like a dance, his hips gently shaking to a rhythm only he can hear amidst the roar of the chainsaw. CUT TO: His powerful yet slender calves, now soiled with dirt and sawdust, as he works meticulously on the imposing tree. The contrast between the pristine, girlish figure we first saw and the increasingly rugged lumberjack is almost poetic. Every swing of the chainsaw, every step he takes, the dirt clinging to him, all add a layer to this character out of place - and yet, strangely at home. The scene almost resembles a surreal music video, where every move is accentuated, every drop of sweat glistens in the sun - the forest is his stage. He cuts through the final piece of timber, and the might of the forest succumbs to his touch with a thunderous CRASH, falling away from the camera. He clicks off the chainsaw, the silence returns jarringly. He exhales heavily, wipes a bead of sweat from his brow with a dirt-streaked forearm, and blows a kiss to the fallen giant. FADE OUT: Suddenly, the dreamy lumberjack RIPS awake, heavy breaths cutting through the quiet of a rustic cabin room. INT. RUSTIC CABIN - MORNING His abrupt awakening from the vibrant dream is met with confusion and a touch of embarrassment. His heart RACES as the remnants of his dream self clash against the reality of his actual, slender physique and gentle demeanor. The dream's vitality lingers in the air. He sits up, clammy hands gripping the sheets, and looks around, slowly recognizing the mundane safety of his room. A silent chuckle escapes his lips, unsure if he should be mortified or amused by the dream's eccentric scenario. As he calms his breathing, he gently touches his lips - no trace of lipstick - then looks at his hands, no gloves, just plain, uncalloused skin. He shakes his head, as if to dismiss the dream, yet the smirk from his dream self plays across his lips one more time before he rises to face the day."},{"prompt":"Write the plot of a historical fiction in which a samurai from japan ends up in aztec territoty","completion":"Title: The Samurai and the Sun Stone Plot: In the early 16th century, as the Sengoku period reaches its peak in Japan, a deeply honorable and skilled samurai named Takeo finds himself without a master after a catastrophic battle that destroys his clan. Without a daimyo to serve, Takeo becomes a ronin, adrift in a land torn by conflict. Seeking a new purpose, he decides to venture beyond the shores of his homeland, choosing to set sail with a group of Portuguese traders on their journey back to the New World. During the voyage across the Pacific, Takeo's ship encounters a violent storm, which leaves him shipwrecked on the coast of a strange and unfamiliar land. He soon discovers that he has been washed ashore in the mighty Aztec Empire, a realm with customs and a language as alien to him as the concept of a warrior without a master. Takeo is fascinated but wary of this powerful civilization, which worships the sun and practices rituals unlike anything he has ever seen. Initially taken as a potential threat, Takeo's life is spared thanks to his combat prowess and the exotic nature of his armor and weaponry, which pique the interest of an Aztec nobleman, who sees the potential for new military techniques to aid in the empire's expansion. Takeo is brought before Emperor Moctezuma II, who decides to allow the ronin to live among them as an oddity and potential asset, granting him a place in the palace. Struggling to adapt to this new world, Takeo befriends a local scribe, Atl, who becomes fascinated with the samurai's bushido code and the tales of faraway lands. Atl is one of the few who treat him not as a curiosity, but as a person and the two form an unlikely bond of friendship. As Takeo learns the Nahuatl language and the ways of the Mexica people, he begins to respect their culture and their warrior ethos, which echoes his own. However, as Takeo begins to find a semblance of belonging, the winds of change blow menacingly. Word arrives of Spanish conquistadors landing on Aztec soil, and tales of their horses, firearms, and insatiable greed for gold spread like wildfire. Takeo, with his own experiences of foreigners and their guns, becomes an unexpected advisor to the Aztecs in military matters. When Hernán Cortés and his men start their march towards the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, Takeo becomes deeply conflicted. His loyalty to his newfound friends clashes with a need to understand his own destiny in this world. His honor dictates that he must repay the kindness and protection that Moctezuma has shown him. He decides to offer his sword to help prepare the Aztecs for the approaching threat. Takeo's journey comes to a climax at the Siege of Tenochtitlan, where he fights alongside the Aztecs with the same bravery and honor he displayed as a samurai. His presence on the battlefield inspires both fear and awe among both the Mexica and Spaniards, who have never witnessed a warrior of his skills and demeanor. In the end, Takeo's fate is sealed with the fall of the Aztec Empire, his story becoming a legend whispered among the remnants of the Aztec people—a wandering samurai who crossed the world and stood with them in their final days against an unstoppable invader. Takeo's life and the lessons he learned from two proud, warrior cultures serve as a testament to the universal values of honor, courage, and loyalty in a world struggling under the currents of change and conquest."},{"prompt":"привет","completion":"Привет!

This is done with the help of the prototypes of the infamous female-piloted only combat exoskeletons designed originally for space exploration known as IS units [IS: Infinite Stratos], the oversized fighter planes with the ability to transform into towering mechs known as Tactical Surface Fighters [Muv-Luv] and the skintight combat bodysuit-weapon combos known as Century Armaments/Hundreds [Hundred] along with the help of Quirk [My Hero Academia] users, the divine extraterrestial creatures known as Diva [Magical Swordsman and Summoner] contractees, who [Diva contractees] are [Diva contractees] usually all female, and the pyrokinetic Generations [Fire Force] and elements of the Japanese National Police Agency, Japanese Self Defence Forces and Japanese Special Assault Team that have become part of the Ōtsutsuki's forces due to it [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] is [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] being [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] considered by the inhabitants of Japan in this story to be the post-Great Catalysm survivors of the real-life Japanese imperial family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato/the Minamoto dynasty due to a mix-up in Kyoto with no one in Japan knowing about chakra or the elemental nations and [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] hasn't corrected the mistake, since its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] supernatural powers, chakra skills and various bloodlines help give credence to the Japanese Imperial Family regaining its [the Japanese Imperial Family's] divine powers from divine ancestry in the minds of the Japanese people as no one in Japan knows about chakra, the Elemental Nations or the Jurai Empire, and [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] governs Japan in a combination of the governance and administation style of the Tokugawa shogunate and that of the pre-1947 Japanese Empire that succeded the Tokugawa shogunate, with the descendants of the Tokugawa acting as shoguns of Japan once more while the heads of the Ōtsutsuki clan act as the Japanese Emperors. The Ōtsutsuki-ruled Kyoto then reunifies Japan under its [ Ōtsutsuki-ruled Kyoto's] leadership and reconquers the post-WW2 lost Japanese provinces of Karufuto [Sahalkin and the Kurils], Chousen [Korean peninsula] and Formosa [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands]. The Ōtsutsuki clan, after restoring Manchuko and the Aisin-Gioro House in Manchuria, the Mongol United Autonomous Federation and the Genghis Khan-descended House of Borjjin in Inner Mongolia, the Ming dynasty and the Imperial House of Zhu in Han China in the form of a neo-Beiyang Government ruled neo-Yuan Shikai formed Empire of China, the Ottoman Empire and the House of Osman in East Turkestan, the Empire of Vietnam and the Ngyuen dynasty in Vietnam, the Kingdom of Laos and the Khun Lo dynasty in Laos and the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast, [the Ōtsutsuki clan] turns its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] attention to reconquering its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] first imperial realm [the Elemental Nations] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] homeland [the Elemental Nations] succeeding in doing so. The Ōtsutsuki clan abolishes the Elemental Nations' shinobi system and replaces it with the Armed Detective [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] system, doing this [implementing the Armed Detective system] across all its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] imperial territories. As a result the Hero system [My Hero Academia] never comes to be as the Meta Liberation Army [My Hero Academia], the Quirk-supremacist group being the Hero system in canon My Hero Academia, [the Meta Liberation Army] is wiped out by the neo-Japanese Empire's forces and the white-haired, red-eyed, tall and slender but also muscular, reserved and soft spoken but also determined, cunning and slick immortal Quirk user with the ability to steal, copy and even give other QuriksMidoriya Hiashi [My Hero Academia], better known by his [Hiashi's] underworld alias All for One [My Hero Academia], [Hiashi] quits the VIllian [My Hero Academia] lifestyle full-time and [Hiashi] instead uses his resources, power and underworld strength to support the neo-Japanese Empire and its progressive ideology. With no Hero system in place for the Meta Liberation Army and its [the MLA's] devotees to hide behind, there is no All Might to hunt down and chase Hiashi and so Hiashi is [Hiashi] able to spend time with his [Hiashi's] current wife, the green-haired, green-eyed, short, slender and petite, but also plump, curvy and rather buxom kind and loving but also sharp and determined Midoriya Inko nee Shimura, who [Inko] like in canon My Hero Academia, [Inko] has no idea of her [Inko's] husband's [Hiashi's] real occupation [villanry] and his [Hiashi's] legitimate son and [Hiashi's] heir, My Hero Academia's green-haired, green-eyed protagonist Midoriya Izuku, who [Izuku] has no idea what his [Izuku's] dad [Hiashi] once did for a living. The story should focus on Hiashi quitting the villian lifestyle after [Hiashi] seeing the Meta Liberation Army's annhilation and realizing that \\"All for One\\" will no longer be needed to rule the underworld from the shadows as a foil [\\"All for One\\"] to the Meta Liberation Army, showing how he [Hiashi] gave up the fake last name of Shiguarki he [Hiashi] used while [Hiashi] ruling the Japanese Underworld as \\"All for One\\" and [Hiashi] returning to his [Hiashi's] true name [Midoriya Hiashi], [Hiashi] adjusting to be a civilian once more and [Hiashi] washing his [Hiashi's] illegally gained trillions through [Hiashi] the disguise as a legitimate buisness tycoon and how he [Hiashi] meets Inko and why she [Inko] falls in love with him [Hiashi] and how he [Hiashi] falls in love with her [Inko], [Hiashi and Inko falling in love with each other |Hiashi and Inko] .

In the sprawling urban landscape of Kyoto, where ancient temples stood alongside mecha hangars and cyber-enhanced dojos, Midoriya Hiashi began the day like any other. But today was different. Today marked the end of an era and the beginning of another. Hiashi adjusted the lapels of his tailored suit—a frivolous habit considering the traditional kimono merged with high-tech fibers would always settle perfectly against his broad shoulders. Reflecting upon his ocean of secrets submerged beneath a tranquil demeanor of a successful businessman, he couldn't help but ponder the journey that had led him here. Beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows of his office, Tactical Surface Fighters launched into azure skies, a trade-off from former shinobi prowess for mechanical valiance. Amidst the bustling streets moved the Armed Detectives, a blend of modern police and ancient sentinels, ensuring that order prevailed under the Ōtsutsuki banner. His path had led to this moment. The Meta Liberation Army had been decimated, their dreams of a Quirk-dominated society now dust under the heel of the empire's boot. The façade of \\"All for One,\\" the cloud of terror that Hiashi once cast over Japan, was no longer necessary. It was time to wash away the sins of a concealed past and start anew. Inko entered the room, her presence a soothing balm to the tumult of his thoughts. Her smile was the sunrise, promising warmth after a long, cold night. She noticed the subtle shift in his stance, the introspective glint in his crimson eyes. \\"Is something troubling you, Hiashi?\\" Inko inquired, setting a tray of tea on the polished wooden table. Hiashi turned to face his wife, the shadow of his former life receding in her light. \\"It's the end of an era, Inko,\\" he said. \\"A lot to leave behind, even more to look forward to.\\" Inko took a seat beside him, her hand finding his. \\"You've always been secretive about your past. But look at what you've done—our peaceful home, the trust you've built… Whatever you did before, you've more than made up for it now.\\" Hiashi’s lips curved slightly—a true smile, not one for show. \\"I have been given a second chance,\\" he said earnestly. \\"I want to ensure a future not just for us, not just for Izuku, but for an empire built on hope rather than fear. An empire where our son can truly become... whatever he dreams to be.\\" \\"Then we start today,\\" Inko asserted confidently. \\"Yes, we do,\\" Hiashi agreed. \\"I will dismantle the shadow of 'All for One'. The empire has its enforcers, its protectors. I'll invest my fortune, my intellect, into reinforcing what we stand for. Perhaps, we can integrate those Century Armaments and IS units into our peacekeeping forces. It's time the underworld knew I was one of their greatest myths.\\" \\"The myth that became a legend,\\" Inko mused with pride. \\"And the man who became a loving husband and father.\\" Their laughter, resonant and genuine, filled the room as the Ōtsutsuki Empire's banners fluttered against the skyline outside—a once shattered world slowly reshaping into an echo of the Galactic Jurai's long-lost glory, with Hiashi and Inko at the heart of its renaissance. And somewhere in the bustling streets below, among the melded wonders of pyrokinesis, chakra, and mechs, a green-haired boy named Izuku carried the legacy of two worlds, blissfully unaware of his destiny at the center of an empire."},{"prompt":"fix the lacks proper spacing between words","completion":"Certainly!

As his eyelids flutter, the scene shifts, diving deep into the realm of his subconscious. CUT TO: EXT. LUMBER CAMP - DAY - DREAM SEQUENCE The dream begins as if a whimsical movie scene — an endless forest of towering trees, each one a silent guardian of the woods. Enchanted sunlight filters through the leaves, dancing to the symphony of nature. Cue the quirky, upbeat background music. Kaito, appearing not as himself but as a SKINNY, GIRLY LUMBERJACK, steps into the frame. His boyish allure amplified by his peculiar attire — DAISY DUKES, and a short-sleeve plaid shirt, the ends tied in a knot just above his navel. A slight breeze tousles his now impeccably styled hair. He winks flirtatiously at an unseen audience, a mischievous smile playing on his lips. Delicately, he slips on his protective GOGGLES with a dramatic flair, followed by chunky EARMUFFS that contrast comically with his slender frame. He flexes his fingers before pulling on bright work GLOVES, transforming his hands from dainty to determined. In a moment of unexpected vanity, he whips out a compact mirror and applies a shimmering LIPSTICK, pouting at his reflection. The lush forest fades into the background, all attention riveted on him as he preens. Kaito approaches his instrument of choice — a hulking, formidable CHAINSAW resting against a stump. He grips it with both hands; it's an absurd sight, the heavy tool juxtaposed against his slight build. He pulls the start cord; the chainsaw roars to life, announcing its power to the surrounding wilderness. KAITO (dreamily to himself) Oh, what a glorious day for some timber! With a flirtatious giggle, he begins his work. The saw bites into the bark, sawdust showers the air like confetti. Kaito struggles, his body swaying to the rhythm of the chainsaw's dance. The camera focuses on his CALVES, once pristine, now clung to by specks of dirt and bark — a badge of surreal labor. Two arduous minutes pass, a flirtatious glint still in his eyes despite the physical toll. The tree creaks, signaling its impending fall. With a final playful wink toward the camera, Kaito leaps clear as the tree crashes down, shuddering the ground. KAITO Timber! Just as the dream bestowed him success, it ebbs away. DISSOLVE TO: INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT Kaito jolts awake, the final reverberations of the tree hitting the ground echoing in his ears. He's now back in the real world, his heart racing. Kaito sits up, brushing the sleep from his eyes, a confused blush on his cheeks as he feels an inexplicable residue of lipstick there — the lone remnant of his odd lumberjack dream. KAITO (confused and amused) What on earth was that all about...? He lies back down, chuckling to himself. Perhaps the dream was bizarre, but a part of him wished the closing credits hadn't rolled quite so soon. He closes his eyes, hoping for a sequel to the lumberjack's flirty adventures.

After a devastating betrayal, Kenjiro is forced to flee Japan to save his life. With nothing left for him in his homeland, he embarks on a perilous journey across the Pacific Ocean, seeking a new life and perhaps redemption. Kenjiro braves the treacherous waters aboard a small trading vessel headed to the Spanish-occupied Philippines, but fate intervenes. A violent storm wreaks havoc on the ship, casting it adrift. After days of fighting for survival, Kenjiro washes ashore on the unfamiliar coast of what is now Mexico, specifically, Aztec territory. Stranded and alone, he must navigate a world completely foreign to him. Despite the language barrier and vast cultural differences, Kenjiro gradually earns the trust of a nearby Aztec tribe, thanks to his prowess in combat and strange, eastern ways that both bewilder and fascinate the locals. He becomes an oddity, then an asset, and finally, a valued member of the community. His path crosses with Citlali, a fierce warrior woman with a spirit as indomitable as his own. As Kenjiro adapts to his new surroundings, he brings with him the discipline of the samurai, and the Aztecs begin to respect the stranger from afar. He trains a select few in the way of the sword, merging Japanese martial techniques with Aztec combat traditions. This cultural exchange strengthens the tribe, earning Kenjiro the honored title of \\"The Samurai in the Sun.\\" But peace is not to last. Word of a strange warrior in Aztec lands reaches the Conquistadors, fresh from their conquests and hungry for new triumphs. Hernán Cortés, intrigued by the potential of a Japanese fighter, decides to seek out Kenjiro for his own purposes. Kenjiro is soon caught between the world he has come to cherish, the culture of his birth, and the encroaching Spaniards who threaten to destroy it all. He must make a choice: stand with his adopted people in a fight he knows they cannot win, or bend to the will of the invaders and turn his back on the bond he has formed with the Aztecs. \\"The Samurai in the Sun\\" is a tale of honor, survival, and the power of unity amidst the backdrop of two colliding empires. Kenjiro's journey is a testament to the idea that courage and respect transcend the boundaries of language and culture, and that even in the unlikeliest of places, one can find a place to call home."},{"prompt":"Traduit moi par tranche de phrase et explique moi le sens.Executives at some of the world's leading artificial intelligence labs are expecting a form of AI on a par with — or even exceeding — human intelligence to arrive sometime in the near future.

Questo EA implementa una strategia di trading algoritmico basata su una serie di indicatori tecnici, ponendo particolare enfasi sulla personalizzazione e l'aggiustabilità delle condizioni di ingresso e uscita del trade. Ecco una panoramica generale della strategia e delle sue componenti: # Parametri dell'Ordine - \`Lots\`: Dimensione del trade per ordine. - \`Max_Orders\`: Numero massimo di ordini aperti contemporaneamente per direzione. - \`Next_Order_Seconds\`: Secondi dopo il primo ingresso per considerare un possibile nuovo ingresso nella stessa direzione. # Indicatori e loro Parametri - \`HPA\` e \`HPB\`: Sono probabilmente indicatori custom o parte di una metodologia di filtraggio del segnale. - \`HPRSI\`: Sembrerebbe essere l'RSI (Relative Strength Index) degli indicatori HPA. - \`MOM\`: Momentum dell'indicatore HPB. - \`RSI\`: Relative Strength Index classico basato sul Momentum dell'indicatore HPB. - \`MFI\`: Money Flow Index. - \`VOL\`: Volumi di scambio. - \`Snake\`: Anche questo è presumibilmente un indicatore custom o uno strumento di analisi tecnica. - Gli indicatori sono valutati su diversi timeframe e con diverse configurazioni, come indicato dai parametri \`Timeframe\`, \`nobs\`, \`FiltPer\`, \`Period\`, ecc. # Trailing Stop e Parametri di Uscita - Modalità di attivazione e configurazione del Trailing Stop. - Definizione dei livelli di stop loss e take profit. - Condizioni basate su ATR (Average True Range) per la gestione degli stop loss dinamici. # Logica di Trading - Gli ordini di acquisto (long) e vendita (short) sono eseguiti sulla base della combinazione delle letture degli indicatori tecnici. - La strategia si avvale di multiple condizioni per permettere l'entrata in posizione, controllate attraverso i parametri \`Entry Toggle\`. - Sembra che sia possibile configurare l'EA per entrare in posizione solo quando tutte le condizioni sono rispettate, il che aggiunge un livello di personalizzazione e di controllo del rischio. # Codice di Gestione - Le funzioni di inizializzazione e deinizializzazione sono presenti per impostare o ripulire l'ambiente di trading al momento del lancio o della chiusura dell'EA. - Il codice mostra un approccio strutturato per inviare e gestire gli ordini, effettuare modifiche e chiudere gli ordini quando necessario. Il codice è abbastanza lungo e complesso, il che implica che potrebbe essere adatto a utenti con una certa esperienza nel trading e nella comprensione degli indicatori tecnici. Inoltre, la strategia sembra mirare a sfruttare molteplici timeframe e una varietà di condizioni di mercato, aumentando la sua robustezza e flessibilità. Tuttavia, la reale efficacia di questa EA può essere determinata solo attraverso il backtesting e l'uso in ambiente di trading reale."},{"prompt":"sembrano esserci più problemi in questo bloco codice. puoi correggerli? bool ExitAllOrders(bool long) // exit all orders { int trade,trades=OrdersTotal(); orderTotN=CheckNumberOrder(); if(long) { for(trade=0;trade<trades;trade++) { OrderSelect(trade,SELECT_BY_POS,MODE_TRADES); if(OrderSymbol()!=Symbol()) continue; if(OrderMagicNumber()!=Magic) continue; if(ExitOrder(true,false)) { orderTotN--; if(orderTotN>0) { trade--; trades--; } else { triggeredL=false; return(false); } } } }","completion":"Il blocco di codice per la funzione \`ExitAllOrders\` intende chiudere tutti gli ordini aperti in una certa direzione (long o short), ma ci sono alcuni problemi che possono causare un comportamento imprevisto: 1. La variabile \`long\` usata come parametro potrebbe causare confusione poiché è anche un tipo di dati in alcuni linguaggi di programmazione, inclusa la famiglia C/C++. Sarebbe meglio rinominarla per evitare ambiguità, ad esempio \`isLong\`. 2. Il ciclo for dovrebbe essere eseguito al contrario perché la chiusura degli ordini altera l'indice degli ordini esistenti. Quando chiudi un ordine, \`OrdersTotal()\` diminuisce di uno, e tutti gli indici degli ordini successivi scendono di uno. 3.

Questa correzione assicura che il blocco di codice sia ben formattato e che solo gli ordini appropriati (long o short) siano chiusi in base al parametro passato alla funzione.

Dato il nome dell'indicatore \\"SnakeForce\\" e la mancanza di una descrizione dettagliata nel codice fornito, si può solo speculare su ciò che fa effettivamente in termini di analisi tecnica. Tuttavia, basandoci su ciò che si può osservare dal codice: - L'indicatore opera su una finestra di indicatore separata, che indica che non è sovrapposto direttamente al grafico dei prezzi ma mostrato in una zona sotto il grafico dei prezzi. - Usa quattro buffer di indicatore (\`ForceUp[]\`, \`ForceDown[]\`, \`ResistanceUp[]\`, \`ResistanceDown[]\`). I buffer di indicatore in MT4 sono aree di memoria usate per memorizzare i valori calcolati dell'indicatore che verranno poi visualizzati sul grafico. - Colora le barre dell'indicatore in due colori (Lime per up e Red per down), forse per indicare direzioni di forza o pressione di acquisto/vendita. - Può cambiare i frame temporali, come indicato dalla variabile esterna \`TimeFrame\`, che permette agli utenti di vedere i dati di un certo timeframe su un grafico con un timeframe diverso. Questo è riferito come \\"Multi-TimeFrame\\" (MTF). - Il parametro \`cPeriod\` suggerisce che l'indicatore utilizza un periodo di calcolo, che potrebbe influenzare quanto è liscia o reattiva la visualizzazione dell'indicatore. Quanto ai dati concreti, l'indicatore richiama il calcolo dei valori tramite la funzione \`iCustom()\`, che è comunemente usata per ottenere valori da indicatori personalizzati in MT4. Questa funzione chiama un altro indicatore probabilmente chiamato \\"SnakeForce\\" che fornisce quattro diverse linee di output. Nel contesto del trading, il nome \\"SnakeForce\\" suggerisce che potrebbe trattarsi di un indicatore che si propone di identificare la forza del movimento del mercato e potenziali livelli di resistenza, ma senza avere sotto mano l'indicatore \\"SnakeForce\\" effettivo e la sua documentazione, non è possibile fornire una spiegazione precisa. Per comprendere esattamente come funziona questo indicatore e a cosa servono le linee \\"Force\\" e \\"Resistance\\", sarebbe necessario guardare il codice sorgente dell'indicatore \\"SnakeForce\\" o avere la documentazione fornita dallo sviluppatore."},{"prompt":"Write the plot of a historical fiction in which a samurai from japan ends up in aztec territoty","completion":"Title: Blades of Sun and Steel Plot: In the year 1582, amidst the political turbulence of the Sengoku period in Japan, a skilled samurai named Takeo finds himself embroiled in a succession conflict. Loyal to his daimyo, Takeo is charged with transporting a cache of priceless artifacts and scrolls to an ally across the sea to ensure their protection. However, a violent storm devastates his ship, leaving him adrift. Takeo finally washes ashore on a distant and exotic land, far removed from the archipelago of Japan. Unbeknownst to him, he has arrived in the expansive territories of the Aztec Empire at the height of its power, a few decades before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors. Initially captured by a local Aztec tribe, Takeo's martial prowess quickly earns him respect and a degree of freedom. As he learns to communicate, he is drawn into the intricate world of Aztec politics and society. He becomes an object of fascination at the court of the Emperor Moctezuma, who is intrigued by this foreign warrior's weapons and fighting techniques, as well as his code of honor, the Bushido. Takeo meanwhile struggles with his own sense of displacement and yearning for home. His samurai training keeps him disciplined, but the longer he spends with the Aztecs, the more he becomes entangled in their culture and conflicts. He teaches some of his samurai skills to a small cadre of Aztec warriors who begin to revere him as a demi-god, blending Bushido with the Aztec warrior code. Conflict arises when an ambitious and ruthless Aztec general perceives Takeo as a threat to his own position and seeks to exploit him as a pawn in his designs for power. Meanwhile, Takeo is haunted by visions of a dark future, akin to omens, possibly derived from the scrolls he safeguarded – prophecies of impending destruction and conquest by foreign invaders. Takeo must navigate this complex web of intrigue, acknowledging his influence on the Aztec warriors while choosing a path that honors his spirit and his homeland's traditions. Ultimately, Takeo's journey becomes one of profound transformation, influencing and being influenced by the rich tapestry of Aztec culture, even as the shadows of history grow long upon the horizon. As the novel reaches its conclusion, Takeo senses the end of an era approaching. He must make a decision: to aid the Aztecs against the foretold invaders, to seek a way home, or to carve out a new destiny in this land where fate has cast him. The \\"Blades of Sun and Steel\\" not only clash but also come to understand one another, leading to a bittersweet finale that honors the noble spirits of both the samurai and the Aztec warrior."},{"prompt":"Write an excerpt for a dialogue, exposition-filled, martial-arts action-filled, gunplay-action filled post-apocalyptic science fiction, urban fantasy, dark fantasy, Chinese wuxia cultivation style, Japanese light novel style military techno-thriller war story novel in the form of crossover fanfic between the Muv-Luv franchise, Fire Force, Naruto, Date a Live, My Hero Academia, Hundred, IS: Infinite Stratos, Aria of the Scarlet Ammo, Tenchi Muyo.

The room, a tapestry of old-world tatami and walls adorned with digital screens projecting serene cherry blossoms, hummed with the unspoken tension of two souls entangled in an unlikely courtship. Inko's gaze found Hiashi's, seeking the depths of his storied past, a labyrinth she yearned to understand. \\"I've heard tales of heroes and their battles,\\" she began, her voice soft as the petals outside, \\"yet you walked from the shadows without so much as carrying a scar. How did you come to leave 'All for One' behind?\\" Hiashi breathed deeply, letting the tranquility of this new world—his world—soothe the storms that once raged within him. \\"When I witnessed the annihilation of the Meta Liberation Army,\\" he recounted, his gaze sliding to their intertwined shadows, \\"I realized the futility of my struggle. Power alone couldn't reshape this world, not when something far greater was emerging.\\" Inko nodded. It was a tale of metamorphosis—a villain's exodus toward a truth that was both profound and personal. She understood then, his desire to wash clean the blood-stained trillions and start anew, to build not just an empire, but a life. \\"The Ōtsutsuki's rise,\\" Inko mused, \\"rewrote not just the chapters of this island nation, but our very spirits. Yet even with chakra bloodlines and celestial might, they sought a harmony between governance and the hearts of people.\\" \\"And that is why I chose a path of legitimate enterprise,\\" Hiashi added, the words tasting strange yet reassuring on his lips. \\"In this age, no shadow need be cast to influence the pillars of society.\\" Their conversation flowed like a duet—a melding of histories personal and grand. The evening light dwindled, surrendering Kyoto to the embrace of twilight. It was then Hiashi spoke of serendipities and synchronized hearts, and the tale of how their destinies converged. \\"The day we met,\\" Hiashi said, a rare warmth lighting his eyes, \\"I saw not just a woman of elegance but one of resilience, one who could thrive amidst the harmonious chaos of our burgeoning empire.\\" Inko blushed, a hint of crimson against her pale cheeks. \\"And I,\\" she whispered, \\"found a paradox.

Do not use ml agents","completion":"Creating a full script that includes all the behaviors you've described, such as learning from the player's actions, chasing the player, self-studying, and finding optimal routes without using machine learning frameworks like ML-Agents, is complex and cannot be fully covered in a single response. However, I can provide you with a simplified structure and basic implementation using Unity's NavMeshAgent for pathfinding. Please note this script will not provide true learning capabilities as you might get with a neural network or machine learning. Instead, we can simulate some \\"learning\\" by having the AI remember certain actions the player takes and then adjusting its behavior based on those actions. First, ensure that you have your environment set up with a NavMesh baked in, and your enemy GameObjects have a NavMeshAgent component attached to them. Here's a foundational script for your enemy AI: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.AI; using System.Collections.Generic; public class EnemyAI : MonoBehaviour { // References public Transform player; // Player's transform private NavMeshAgent agent; // Enemy's NavMeshAgent private Vector3 lastSeenPlayerPosition; // Last seen player position // Settings public float chaseDistance = 10f; // Distance at which enemy will start chasing // To simulate the \\"learning\\", we'll store some player positions. private List<Vector3> playerPositions = new List<Vector3>(); // To simulate \\"looking for profitable routes\\", we'll try different predefined paths. private List<Vector3> patrolPoints = new List<Vector3>(); private int patrolIndex = 0; private void Awake() { agent = GetComponent<NavMeshAgent>(); } private void Update() { // Distance check if(Vector3.Distance(transform.position, player.position) <= chaseDistance) { ChasePlayer(); } else { Patrol(); } } private void ChasePlayer() { // Update last seen player position lastSeenPlayerPosition = player.position; // Add this position to the stored player positions (learning) playerPositions.Add(lastSeenPlayerPosition); // Actually chase the player agent.SetDestination(player.position); } private void Patrol() { if(patrolPoints.Count == 0) return; // Follow a predefined patrol path, can be modified to simulate learning of profitable routes if(!agent.pathPending && agent.remainingDistance < 0.5f) { MoveToNextPatrolPoint(); } } private void MoveToNextPatrolPoint() { if (patrolPoints.Count == 0) return; // Set the agent to go to the currently selected destination. agent.destination = patrolPoints[patrolIndex]; // Choose the next point in the array as the destination, // cycling to the start if necessary. patrolIndex = (patrolIndex + 1) % patrolPoints.Count; } // A custom function to simulate learning by occasionally removing ineffective pursuit positions public void SimplifyLearnedPositions() { // Your logic to remove some positions to simulate \\"learning\\" // For example, remove positions that are too similar to each other } } \`\`\` In this script: - The \`ChasePlayer\` method is responsible for chasing the player when within a certain distance. - The \`Patrol\` method moves the enemy along predefined patrol points, which could be modified to simulate looking for profitable routes. - The \`SimplifyLearnedPositions\` method is a placeholder for any logic you might want to implement to simulate learning by pruning less useful player positions. The script is very rudimentary in terms of \\"learning\\" and could be enhanced with more complex logic. Remember, without using proper machine learning techniques, the AI's capacity to learn from the player's actions is extremely limited. To use this script: 1. Attach it to your enemy GameObjects. 2. Assign the player's Transform to the 'player' variable in the inspector. 3. Set the \`patrolPoints\` List in the script to include Vector3 positions you want your enemy to patrol when not chasing the player. This basic AI will chase the player when they are near and patrol along a set path otherwise.

The night swallowed every corner of Kyoto, now a radiant testament to the Ōtsutsuki Empire's reach and ambition, its skyscrapers piercing the dark like a field of luminous blades. **Inko Shimura**, a slight figure shrouded in the soft halo of the atrium's ambient light, approached Hiashi, her steps quiet yet determined. \\"Hiashi,\\" she began, her voice low and filled with concern, \\"I never knew this view existed in our home. It's... breathtaking.\\" \\"It is, isn't it?\\" Hiashi responded without tearing his gaze from the city. \\"Symbolic, too, of the times we've left behind... and those we're venturing into.\\" She nodded, moving to stand beside him. \\"Tell me, when you look out there, what do you see? A world to conquer or one to protect?\\" Hiashi sighed, a gentle chuckle escaping his lips. \\"I saw a grand stage for my ambition,\\" he confessed, \\"a narrative spun from power that I thought I could dominate—All for One, as they knew me. But that's in the past now, Inko.\\" \\"You've never spoken of it to me,\\" she observed, \\"of what you were before.\\" He turned to face her, revealing eyes laden with the weight of countless lifetimes. \\"Because that Hiashi is gone. With the Meta Liberation Army dismantled, an empire risen, and chakra merged with the modern, there is no place for such a man. The Ōtsutsuki have abolished old systems, and with it, old enmities.\\" Inko searched his face, finding the lines of difficulty and the shadows of former power. \\"And the man that stands before me? Who is he?\\" Hiashi reached out, taking her hand in his. \\"A man who's found love in a world that no longer needs an All for One. The man who wishes to build with you, a life filled with simple, unburdened joy.\\" Their eyes met, and a shared understanding passed between them; it was a look of profound connection, of life stories converging into a singular, intertwined fate. \\"Then let's start anew, Hiashi,\\" Inko suggested with a smile as bright as the city lights. \\"To live not as shadows of the past, but as bearers of a new dawn.\\" --- The shifts in Japan had been seismic. The titanium bones of **Tactical Surface Fighters** lay dormant, a relic of a conquest complete, while centuries old traditions and modern **Century Armaments** wove into the fabric of the neo-empire. **Quirk** users walked the streets, not as specters to fear, but as citizens of a blossoming realm. **Armed Detectives**, entrusted with the safety of the empire's territories, patrolled the cities, ensuring the peace once wrought by the clash of shinobi was maintained in this new era. Chakra was known by different names now, rebranded in the eyes of those who had never seen the majestic Hidden Villages of old. Life prospered under the flag of the Ōtsutsuki, and at the heart of it all was the normalcy Hiashi yearned for his family—a life where his son, Izuku, could grow under the sun rather than the omnipresent gaze of a hidden ruler. As Hiashi folded his darker self away, tucked beneath layers of redemption and hope, he felt a warmth spreading within him. Inko's love was like sunlight breaking through the long night of his existence, promising a world where his name would evoke smiles instead of fear, where **Izuku** could dream without the burden of a grim legacy. It was in this melding pot of fantasy and reality, magic and machinery, the old and the new, that Hiashi found his true calling—not as a shadow emperor, but as a father, a husband, and a man reborn in the aftermath of empires clashing and ideologies merging. This was his story—a chronicle of power forsaken for the gentle embrace of peace and love, a tale of a world where martial prowess intertwined with technological marvels, and where once, the rumble of war gave way to the whisper of family life, pure and unbroken by the shadows of the past."},{"prompt":"Write the plot of a historical fiction in which a samurai from japan ends up in aztec territoty","completion":"Title: \\"Blades Across the Sea\\" Plot: In the year 1582, in the Sengoku period of Japan, a distinguished samurai named Katsuro Tanaka finds dishonor in his failure to protect his daimyō in a critical battle. Disgraced, Katsuro decides to leave his homeland in search of redemption. He takes to the sea, vowing to bring back knowledge that will strengthen his lord's domain. Katsuro's travels take an unexpected turn when a violent storm wrecks his ship, leaving him adrift. He eventually washes ashore on the coast of a mysterious and uncharted land. Unbeknownst to Katsuro, he has arrived in the territory of the Aztec Empire, a civilization rich in its own warrior tradition. Weak and disoriented, Katsuro is captured by a group of Aztec warriors. Intrigued by the foreigner's armor and weapons, the Aztecs, led by a noble warrior named Citlali, decide to take him to their capital, Tenochtitlan. Katsuro is amazed by the sight of the grand city and its pyramids, and he quickly becomes a subject of fascination at the Aztec court. The emperor, intrigued by the samurai's honor code and martial prowess, allows Katsuro to live among them as a curiosity and potential asset. As time passes, Katsuro learns Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, and begins to understand and respect their culture, forming a friendship with Citlali based on their shared warrior values. Meanwhile, Katsuro witnesses the arrival of Spanish conquistadors on Aztec lands, and familiar with the threat that new technology and foreign ambitions represent, he decides to aid the Aztecs in their defense. Katsuro trains a group of Aztec warriors in the art of Kenjutsu, blending his samurai tactics with their indigenous fighting styles. A special bond forms between the Japanese warrior and his new comrades, and he earns a new name, \\"Tempest-Sword,\\" in the Aztec language. As tensions escalate between the Aztecs and the Spanish, Katsuro becomes deeply involved in the Aztec resistance. In a series of fierce battles, he fights alongside Citlali and the Aztec warriors, employing a mix of Japanese fighting techniques and Aztec bravery. Through their shared struggles, Katsuro finally finds the honor he lost, not by returning home, but by defending his new-found brothers-in-arms. As the fight against the Spaniards becomes increasingly dire, Katsuro and Citlali conceive a final desperate plan to save Tenochtitlan from destruction. Their friendship and unity become a powerful testament to the transcendence of cultural boundaries in the face of common adversaries. In the end, \\"Blades Across the Sea\\" tells a story of redemption and kinship that crosses vast oceans and joins disparate worlds through the shared code of the warrior. It is a tale of how honor can be rediscovered in the most unexpected places, and how even the farthest of strangers can become as close as brothers."},{"prompt":"Traduit moi par tranche de phrase et explique moi le sens.Recently Dr. Trieu Trinh and colleagues published a paper in Nature introducing their AI model AlphaGeometry, which solves geometry problems at the Math Olympiad level. I suspect AlphaGeometry’s emphasis on math will generate less buzz than some of the sexier AI breakthroughs, but the case can be made that it’s a big deal.

Ils y présentent un modèle d'intelligence artificielle qu'ils ont développé, nommé AlphaGeometry, capable de résoudre des problèmes de géométrie complexes similaires à ceux posés lors des concours internationaux de mathématiques pour étudiants, comme les Olympiades de mathématiques. \\"Je suspecte que l'accent mis par AlphaGeometry sur les maths générera moins de buzz que certaines des percées en IA plus \\"séduisantes\\", mais on peut avancer que c'est une grande avancée.\\" L'auteur exprime ici son opinion, soupçonnant que le modèle d'IA spécialisé en mathématiques attire moins l'attention du public et des médias comparé à d'autres avancées en intelligence artificielle qui peuvent sembler plus glamour ou intéressantes pour le grand public. Cependant, l'auteur souligne que l'importance de cette avancée dans le domaine des mathématiques ne doit pas être sous-estimée ou négligée. \\"Les maths sont l'une des dernières frontières des capacités de l'IA que les modèles de langage génératif moins personnalisés ont tendance à avoir du mal à appréhender.\\" Avec cette phrase, l'auteur pointe le fait que l'intelligence artificielle a encore du mal à traiter et à résoudre des problèmes de mathématiques, qui représentent donc un challenge considérable pour le développement futur de l'IA. En comparaison avec d'autres tâches, comme le traitement du langage naturel, les mathématiques exigent un niveau de précision et de compréhension logique plus complexe, ce qui n'est pas facilement réalisable par des modèles d'IA généraux destinés à un large éventail de tâches. \\"Ainsi, certaines idées clés concernant l'avenir de la recherche en IA peuvent être déduites d'AlphaGeometry.\\" Cette dernière phrase suggère que l'étude et l'analyse des succès et des méthodologies du modèle AlphaGeometry pourront fournir des indices importants sur la direction que la recherche en IA pourrait prendre, ou devrait prendre, pour transformer ces domaines difficiles en nouveaux succès pour l'intelligence artificielle."},{"prompt":"Traduit moi par tranche de phrase et explique moi le sens.Here is a high level summary of how AlphaGeometry works. If you dare, the paper can be read here. The authors describe the model as a “neuro-symbolic” architecture, which means it is a hybrid of a neural network language model and a deductive symbolic engine. (A symbolic engine is a type of program that is built around processing mathematical symbols and usually has built in deductive math rules.) Thanks to this symbolic engine, this model bypasses one of the initial hurdles to training a neural network based language model to do math well, a dearth of machine-readable data. It accomplishes this feat by generating its own synthetic data using the symbolic engine rather than relying on relatively scarce human provided demonstrations.","completion":"\\"Voici un résumé de haut niveau du fonctionnement d'AlphaGeometry.

Cependant, grâce à l'interface symbolique, AlphaGeometry peut surmonter cet obstacle. \\"Il réalise cet exploit en générant ses propres données synthétiques en utilisant le moteur symbolique plutôt que de se fier à des démonstrations fournies par l'homme, qui sont relativement rares.\\" Cela signifie que, plutôt que de dépendre de données fournies par des humains, ce qui est assez limité, AlphaGeometry est capable de créer lui-même ses propres données d'entraînement grâce au moteur symbolique.

The Ōtsutsuki clan, descendants of the celestial Jurai Empire, have reshaped Japan with an iron grip enshrined in ancient legend and futuristic might, having subdued the chaos that once threatened to consume the island nation. At a clandestine meeting beneath a frozen blossom tree, illuminated by the ephemeral glow of fireflies genetically re-engineered to double as surveillance drones, Midoriya Hiashi stood tall, his red-rimmed gaze surveying the digital maps that hovered in the air before him. Each flicker of his eyes delved deeper into the strategic layout of his empire—now free from the Hero system that never came to be. \\"Hiashi-sama,\\" a loyal underling bowed, the shadow-touched embers of a Pyrokinetic Generation dancing across his fingertips, a gift from the once independent Great Tokyo Empire. \\"The annihilation of the Meta Liberation Army solidifies your wisdom. Your leadership even without 'All for One' remains unchallenged.\\" Hiashi nodded, a silent acknowledgment. The wind whispered over steel and skin, carrying the scent of change. The empire he now aided was a far cry from the shadowed corners he once ruled as a villain. He remembered the words of his late mentor: \\"Power is fleeting, Hiashi. Empire is eternal.\\" And so Hiashi chose to turn his back on the villainous legacy of 'All for One', embracing the role of a powerful ally to the Neo-Japanese Empire. With Quirk-supremacism extinguished, he aimed to reinvent himself, channeling his indomitable will into legitimizing his vast fortunes amassed in darkness to now gleam in the light of day. In an obscure café hidden among the ancient cobblestones of Tokyo's reimagined past, Midoriya Hiashi, diligently camouflaged in the guise of a visionary entrepreneur, encountered a woman whose grace outmatched the carefully crafted serenity of the locale. Shimura Inko, with eyes as verdant as the lush gardens that marked the change of seasons, observed the world with quiet curiosity. Their conversation was a dance of intellect and charm, Hiashi artfully concealing his enigmatic past as he spoke of potential futures. \\"Inko-san,\\" Hiashi began, with a warmth that felt unfamiliar on his tongue yet genuine in his barren heart, \\"I envision a society where innovation elevates humanity, where the bloodlines of old and new converge to create a more harmonious world. What say you of such a vision?\\" Inko, her expression a delicate blend of thoughtfulness and optimism, replied, \\"Hiashi-san, a world where kindness and advancement work hand in hand is one I'd like to see flourish. Shall we then... dare to aspire together?\\" A silent agreement, an exchange of smiles — two souls entwining under the watchful gaze of a rising empire. Their romance grew amidst the backdrop of martial mechs soaring above, IS pilots training in the distance against a skyline marked by the incandescent streaks of Tactical Surface Fighters. And beyond the splendor, the empire's expansion continued, as the Ōtsutsuki clan conquered realms once thought untouchable, restoring ancient dynasties and wielding powers that bordered on divine. In economics and territories, Hiashi learned to wield his intellect as deftly as his Quirks, every decision weaving a tapestry of progress and tranquility that even the stillest hearts could not ignore. As he began to genuinely surrender his shadows to the light, the future he had once shaped with fear now beckoned with promise, with Inko at his side. Yet, within the heart of an empire built on secrets, the deepest of all remained the truth of Midoriya Hiashi, where 'All for One' lay dormant, patient. A secret that, for love and for the future of his unborn heir, must forever be kept from coming to light."},{"prompt":"Traduit moi par tranche de phrase et explique moi le sens.Mark Zuckerberg’s new goal is creating artificial general intelligence And he doesn’t want to control it.

His lord is slain in battle, and Toru, now a ronin – a masterless samurai – decides to leave his homeland to avoid the shame of serving a new master unworthy of his loyalty. Toru embarks on a perilous journey aboard a Portuguese trading ship, seeking to hone his martial skills in foreign lands and discover his own path as a warrior. Fate, however, has a different course plotted for him. A violent storm off the coast of the New World casts him adrift, and he washes ashore in the unfamiliar and exotic lands of the Aztec Empire. In this strange world, at the zenith of its power and just before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors, Toru is confronted with a society both fascinating and brutal. While the samurai upholds the code of bushido, the Aztecs perform sacrificial rites to appease their deities – a practice that unsettles Toru, but also resonates with the sense of ritual and honor present in his own culture. Initially captured by the Aztecs, Toru's unparalleled skills with the katana and his unfamiliar appearance intrigue Emperor Moctezuma II, who grants him his freedom in exchange for martial instruction to his elite Jaguar warriors. As Toru begins to teach them the way of the sword, he develops a deep respect for the Aztecs' own warrior culture and their formidable fighters. Toru's presence and influence start to weave into the political and military fabric of the empire. He forms a close bond with a high-ranking Aztec warrior, Citlali, whose courage and leadership inspire him. Their friendship strengthens as they share their respective warrior philosophies and techniques. Toru introduces the concept of 'kendo', or \\"the way of the sword,\\" while Citlali teaches him the fierce prowess of the macuahuitl, the Aztec obsidian-edged weapon. Their bond is tested as omens and prophecy foretell the arrival of strange pale-skinned invaders from across the sea. Toru, driven by his sense of honor and now a deep loyalty to his new brethren, stands with the Aztecs as they prepare to confront the impending threat. As he integrates samurai tactics with Aztec martial traditions, Toru seeks to devise strategies that might resist the coming onslaught of the Spanish conquistadors. Amidst love, newfound friendship, and loyalties tested by the crucible of imminent war, \\"The Blade across the Ocean\\" delves into the heart of a warrior adrift from his homeland, who discovers that despite the vastness of the ocean between them, the samurai and the Aztec share a universal bond in their pursuit of honor, valor, and a legacy that will outlive their impending turmoil. Toru's story becomes a poignant reflection upon the clash of civilizations and the bittersweet unity found in the warrior's path."},{"prompt":"Describe the World War II Normandy battle as if it were a medieval vision","completion":"Lords and lieges, gather 'round, and I shall recount the epic tale of a monumental clash, where the gallant warriors of the realm did cross the great watery abyss to reclaim the lands from an ensorcelled darkness. This tale, not of jousts and quests, but of iron-clad steeds and thunderous sky chariots, unfolds in a time not of our own—the epoch known as World War the Second. In the year of our Lord Nineteen Hundred and Forty-Four, the noble houses of diverse realms, known to some as the Alliédène Covenant, banded together in the name of freedom and honor. They did gaze across the English channel — a foaming maw as ominous as any dragon's lair — toward the sandy beaches of Normandy, a land under the yoke of a malevolent force, the Axis, whose tyrants and sorcerers had spun a web of cruelty and domination over much of the continent. The Alliédène Covenant, under the marshalship of wise and valiant generals whose names would echo through the annals of history, devised a grand and daring stratagem. They mustered a host of warriors unmatched in number, from lands near and far—a veritable crusade to break the fetters of oppression and darkness. They called it Operation Overlord, as if to set a righteous ruler upon the realm that had lost its way. As the sun lifted its flaming eye on the day called June the Sixth, a tempest of iron and fury descended upon Normandy’s hallowed grounds. Behold, a phalanx of sea-faring leviathans, known in that time as warships, unleashed their furious barrage upon the adversary's bastions, churning sand and stone into a dusty maelstrom. Above them, sky-borne heralds, the gilded angels and metallic raptors, tore through the heavens, their cries mingling with the clashing of elemental forces below. The brave knights, encased not in gleaming mail but in garb of drab hue and helmets of steel, descended upon the shores in their floating chariots, wielding not swords and lances, but the thunder sticks and fire lances of their age. The air was thick with the stench of oil and spell-smoke; the cacophony of battle rang louder than any dragon's roar or clashing melee. Upon hitting the gilded sands of Normandy’s kingdom, they met with fierce resistance from the Axis minions, sorcerers, and warlords who had conjured ramparts of timber and earth, and laid hellish traps and enchantments that sang death from the very ground. These defenders, too, garbed in their war regalia, stood ready with their own thunder sticks and fire lances, seeking to hold their ground with unyielding determination and dire intent. Despite the maelstrom of sorcery-laden artillery and the grim toll the surge did levy upon the Alliédène warriors, with stout hearts and brotherhood's bond, they breached fortress after fortress, breaking the spells that bound the land with every flag they planted and every foe they vanquished. 'Twas a long and grueling campaign, one that would unfold over sundry moons and take its place as a pivotal fray in the annals of this great and terrible conflict. Many a brave soul was consigned to the realm of their ancestors, their sacrifices etching a legacy of valor, and through unflagging perseverance, the Alliédène Covenant did reclaim the lands, inch by bloody inch. So ends the tale of that fateful encounter in Normandy, a battle not of our time, but one whose echoes can still be discerned by keen ears, a testament to the ceaseless struggle of light against encroaching darkness, and the valor that has, and ever shall, shape the destiny of humankind."},{"prompt":"Traduit moi par tranche de phrase et explique moi le sens.“We’ve come to this view that, in order to build the products that we want to build, we need to build for general intelligence,” Zuckerberg tells me in an exclusive interview. “I think that’s important to convey because a lot of the best researchers want to work on the more ambitious problems.” Here, Zuckerberg is saying the quiet part aloud.

Many applications of robots in space require the robot to manipulate a load mass that is not negligible compared to the satellite on which the robot is mounted. In such cases, the robot motion disturbs the position and attitude of the satellite, and this in turn disturbs the robot end-effector position. This implies that the robot joint angles that would normally be commanded to produce a prescribed robot end-effector position and orientation will result in missing the target. In this paper an overview is given of certain engineering problems arising from this phenomenon. The robot end-effector positioning problem is discussed for the two cases of the satellite attitude control system either off or on, and computation of the robot motion disturbances to the satellite is discussed. Shuttle Remote Manipulator System based examples are given what does it say?","completion":"The passage you provided appears to be a summary or abstract from a paper discussing the dynamics and control challenges of operating robots in space, particularly when handling large loads relative to the host satellite platform. Here's a breakdown of what the passage is conveying: 1. The paper serves as an introduction to broader topics explored in more depth in the other papers within the same issue. It acts as a primer for the discussion that follows in related research. 2. It is common for space applications of robots to involve manipulating significant loads, and these loads can have masses that are not small when compared with the satellite (or space vehicle) to which the robot is attached. 3. When a robot moves a substantial mass in space, this movement can affect (disturb) the position and attitude (orientation) of the host satellite. This interaction is due to the conservation of momentum in a microgravity environment, where every action has an equal and opposite reaction. 4. These disturbances, in turn, influence the position of the robot's end-effector (the part of the robot that interacts with the environment, similar to a hand). That means the usual commands sent to the robot's joints, which are calculated based on the desired end-effector position and orientation, may not be accurate. They won't account for the disturbance to the satellite and thus may fail to achieve the intended end-effector position and orientation. 5. The paper then discusses the engineering challenges that arise from this issue. It considers scenarios where the satellite's attitude control system (the system responsible for maintaining the satellite's orientation) is either turned off or operating. 6. The calculation of the robot-induced disturbances to the satellite's dynamics is also a subject of discussion. These calculations are essential to accurately predict and compensate for the interaction effects between the robot and the satellite. 7. Examples based on the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS), also known as the Canadarm, are used to illustrate these concepts. The SRMS is a robotic arm that was used on the Space Shuttle to move payloads and support astronauts during spacewalks and has provided many practical lessons for robotic manipulators in space. In summary, the paper focuses on addressing how the inertia and dynamics of space robotics interact with the hosting spacecraft and how these interactions must be managed to achieve precise manipulation tasks in space. It lays the foundational understanding for other, more specific studies, and offers computations and examples with the intent of improving space robotics engineering and operations."},{"prompt":"il controllo dell'assetto del satellite ha effettia nche sul suo momento angolare?","completion":"Sì, il controllo dell'assetto del satellite ha effetto sul suo momento angolare. Il momento angolare è una proprietà fisica conservata in un sistema isolato, e per un satellite o qualsiasi altro oggetto che si muove nello spazio, riflette lo stato della sua rotazione. Il controllo dell'assetto (actitude control) consiste in una serie di azioni e meccanismi che modificano l'orientamento di un satellite per far fronte a determinati obiettivi, come il puntamento di strumenti, l'orientamento dei pannelli solari verso il Sole, o la regolazione dell'antenna verso la Terra. I sistemi di controllo dell'assetto possono includere l'uso di: 1. **Ruote di reazione (reaction wheels) o volani (flywheels)**: Questi dispositivi sfruttano il principio di conservazione del momento angolare. Impartendo una velocità angolare a una ruota all’interno del satellite, sarà presente un cambio di momento angolare opposto nel resto del satellite secondo il principio dell'azione e reazione. 2. **Propulsori**: Piccoli razzi possono essere usati per fornire spinte controllate in certe direzioni, cambiando l'orientamento del satellite nel processo. 3. **Magneti o torquer magnetici (magnetorquers)**: Questi dispositivi interagiscono con il campo magnetico terrestre per esercitare coppie di forza che possono modificare l’assetto. Quando uno di questi sistemi agisce per cambiare l'assetto del satellite, il momento angolare complessivo del sistema non può cambiare spontaneamente perché deve essere rispettato il principio della conservazione del momento angolare. Tuttavia, la distribuzione del momento angolare tra i diversi componenti del satellite (per esempio tra il satellite stesso e le ruote di reazione) può cambiare. Se viene esercitata una coppia di forze esterna (che può essere prodotta dai dispositivi sopra menzionati), essa cambierà il momento angolare del satellite. Ciò significa che, se il sistema di controllo dell'assetto è in funzione, effettivamente contribuirà a modificare sia l'orientamento che il momento angolare del satellite nel tentativo di raggiungere il suo obiettivo di assetto."},{"prompt":"Il sistema di controllo dell'assetto (ACS) è spesso disattivato sullo Shuttle quando il Il sistema di manipolazione remota è in uso. Uno dei motivi è evitare la collisione l'effettore finale del robot con un oggetto che sta per essere afferrato, a causa dell'attivazione improvvisa dei propulsori di controllo dell'assetto. Anche se attuatori come ruote di reazione sono stati utilizzati, che non richiedono una modalità di funzionamento on-off, imprecisioni e il comportamento transitorio dell'ACS potrebbe comunque suggerire il funzionamento del robot con il sistema spento. Un altro motivo per disattivare l'ACS nel caso dello Shuttle è quello di evitare l'impatto dei gas di scarico dell'ACS sul carico manipolato. Come accennato in precedenza, quando un robot è montato su un satellite la cui rotazione il movimento non è vincolato dal controllo attivo dell'assetto, la posizione dell'effettore finale nello spazio inerziale al termine della manovra del robot, non è puramente una funzione di gli angoli articolari finali della manovra.

La cinetica inversa il problema descritto in [1] in generale richiede la ricerca di storie di angoli comuni da soddisfare un problema ai valori al contorno di un'equazione differenziale. Il problema è complicato da il fatto che nel porre il problema della cinetica inversa non si specifica solo dove si vuole l'effettore finale nello spazio inerziale, ma anche quale assetto finale del satellite è desiderato.

Da notare però che non si può richiedere che l'assetto venga mantenuto per tutta la manovra, anche se tale può controllare l'entità della deviazione dell'assetto con uno sforzo aggiuntivo. In alternativa, si potrebbe considerare l'utilizzo dell'operazione del robot come metodo di esecuzione cambiamenti nell'assetto del satellite.

Riferimento [1] in questo numero si sviluppa una soluzione al problema della cinetica inversa, e anche [4]. in questo numero, sviluppa un approccio numerico per ottenere altre soluzioni. Cosa si sta dicedno?","completion":"Il testo descrive una situazione complessa che si verifica nell'ambiente spaziale quando si utilizza un braccio robotico (sistema di manipolazione remota) montato su uno shuttle o satellite. Eccovi una sintesi dei punti chiave: 1. **Disattivazione del sistema di controllo dell'assetto (ACS)**: L'SCS viene spesso disattivato durante l'uso del braccio robotico dello Shuttle per evitare problemi derivati dai suoi attuatori (come i propulsori), che potrebbero: - Causare un'improvvisa attivazione e quindi una collisione dell'effettore finale del robot con l'oggetto da afferrare. - Produrre un'impronta dei gas di scarico sui carichi manipolati, potenzialmente danneggiandoli o contaminandoli. 2. **Problematiche cinematiche e dinamiche**: Quando l'ACS è spento, la posizione dell'effettore finale del robot nel riferimento inerziale (cioè non rotante rispetto alle stelle) non è soltanto una funzione degli angoli articolari del braccio robotico a causa delle interazioni dinamiche tra il braccio e il satellite. Questo significa che non è sufficiente utilizzare il problema standard della cinematica inversa (calcolo degli angoli delle articolazioni per raggiungere una determinata posizione dell'effettore finale) perché bisogna tenere conto anche del movimento dinamico complessivo del satellite. 3. **Nuovo problema di cinetica diretta**: Per gestire correttamente il braccio robotico in queste condizioni, è necessario specificare il moto relativo dei collegamenti del robot nel tempo e utilizzare queste informazioni per determinare il movimento dinamico del satellite e quindi dell'effettore finale. Questo problema è diverso dallo standard cinematografico inverso e richiede la soluzione di un problema ai valori al contorno di un'equazione differenziale. 4. **Cinetica inversa e controllo dell'assetto**: Oltre a determinare dove si vuole che il robot termini in termini di posizione dell'effettore finale e di condizione finale dell'assetto del satellite, il problema della cinetica inversa può anche includere il requisito che l'assetto del satellite non cambi alla fine della manovra, evitando così un consumo aggiuntivo di carburante per l'ACS. Tuttavia, non si può pretendere che l'assetto rimanga inalterato per tutta la durata della manovra del braccio robotico. 5. **Soluzioni al problema della cinetica inversa**: A differenza del problema della cinematica inversa, che spesso ha soluzioni isolate multiple, il problema della cinetica inversa tende ad avere un numero infinitamente grande di soluzioni. È citato il riferimento [1] che sviluppa una soluzione a questo problema, e anche il riferimento [4], che propone un approccio numerico per ottenere altre soluzioni. In sintesi, il testo sta sottolineando le sfide tecniche nel controllare con precisione un braccio robotico montato su uno shuttle o un satellite, tenendo conto delle interazioni dinamiche e del controllo dell'assetto, e indicando che sono state sviluppate diverse soluzioni per affrontare questi complessi problemi di controllo."},{"prompt":"non ho capito il primo punto","completion":"Mi scuso per la confusione. Cercherò di chiarire ulteriormente il primo punto. **Disattivazione del sistema di controllo dell'assetto (ACS) durante l'utilizzo dello Shuttle Remote Manipulator System:** Il sistema di controllo dell'assetto (ACS) è responsabile per mantenere l’orientamento desiderato di uno shuttle o satellite nello spazio. Tuttavia, quando si utilizza un braccio robotico o un sistema di manipolazione remota, come il Canadarm sullo Space Shuttle, può essere utile disattivare l'ACS per diverse ragioni: 1. **Evitare collisioni dovute all'attivazione dei propulsori**: Se l'ACS è attivo, può decidere di correggere l'orientamento dello shuttle in qualunque momento utilizzando propulsori a gas. Questa attivazione improvvisa può causare spostamenti o rotazioni non previsti dello Shuttle, portando potenzialmente l'effettore finale del robot (la parte che afferra gli oggetti) a collidere con l'oggetto da manipolare. 2. **Evitare il deposito dei gas di scarico sull'oggetto manipolato**: I propulsori dell'ACS espellono gas quando vengono attivati. Se l'oggetto che il braccio robotico sta manipolando è sensibile (per esempio strumentazione scientifica, satelliti o altri carichi utili), il depositarsi dei gas di scarico può contaminarli o danneggiarli. Dunque, per evitare questi problemi, l'ACS viene disattivato temporaneamente quando si utilizza il braccio robotico per manovrare oggetti nello spazio. Disattivando l'ACS, si mantiene l'ambiente stabile per il funzionamento sicuro del braccio robotico, e si riducono i rischi di disturbi causati dalle correzioni di assetto che potrebbero interferire con le operazioni di manipolazione."},{"prompt":"Come accennato in precedenza, quando un robot è montato su un satellite la cui rotazione il movimento non è vincolato dal controllo attivo dell'assetto, la posizione dell'effettore finale nello spazio inerziale al termine della manovra del robot, non è puramente una funzione di gli angoli articolari finali della manovra.

Potresti riassurmi i passaggi chiave?","completion":"Certamente, proverò a riassumere i concetti chiave presentati nel testo: 1. **Complessità nella posizione dell'effettore finale**: Quando si usa un robot nello spazio montato su un satellite senza un attivo controllo dell'assetto, il comportamento del robot e la posizione del suo effettore finale non possono essere predetti solamente attraverso gli angoli delle articolazioni. Questo è perché il movimento del robot influisce sul movimento del satellite stesso. 2. **Problemi di cinetica diretta e inversa**: A causa dell'interazione tra il robot e il satellite, non si può applicare semplicemente la cinematica inversa tradizionale (che calcola gli angoli articolari necessari per ottenere una specifica posizione dell'effettore finale). È invece necessaria una soluzione che consideri la relazione dinamica tra il movimento delle articolazioni del robot e il movimento complessivo del satellite (cinetica diretta). 3. **Cinetica inversa e requisiti di assetto del satellite**: Il problema si complica ulteriormente perché, nella cinetica inversa, non si deve solamente specificare la posizione finale desiderata dell'effettore finale, ma anche l'assetto finale desiderato del satellite. In alcune situazioni, si può richiedere che l'assetto del satellite rimanga invariato al termine della manovra, riducendo il consumo di propellente necessario per correzioni dell'assetto. 4. **Controllo dell'assetto durante la manovra**: Non è possibile garantire che l'assetto rimanga invariato durante l'intera manovra del braccio robotico, ma si potrebbe voler controllare la deviazione dell'assetto per ridurre l'intervento del sistema di controllo dell'assetto. Inoltre, si potrebbe considerare l'uso del robot come mezzo per cambiare intenzionalmente l'assetto del satellite. 5. **Infinite soluzioni**: A differenza del problema della cinematica inversa, che potrebbe avere più soluzioni discrete, il problema della cinetica inversa tende ad avere infinite soluzioni a causa delle complesse interazioni dinamiche. Ciò comporta che la ricerca di una soluzione richiede metodi avanzati per determinare quali storie degli angoli articolari possono produrre i risultati desiderati. 6. **Sviluppo di soluzioni**: Nel testo sono menzionati dei riferimenti che trattano di soluzioni sviluppate per il problema della cinetica inversa, inclusi approcci numerici per trovare soluzioni praticabili all'interno dell'infinito spettro di possibilità. In breve, il testo sta discutendo le sfide complesse nel comandare un braccio robotico nello spazio in modo da controllare sia la posizione dell'effettore finale sia la configurazione globale dell'assetto del satellite, mentre si evitano interferenze con il controllo attivo dell'assetto quando possibile."},{"prompt":"dopo parla di matrice diadica che intende ina una rotazione?","completion":"Il termine \\"matrice diadica\\" non è tipicamente associato alla rotazione nelle discussioni standard di cinematica e dinamica dei corpi rigidi, ma potrebbe esservi un malinteso o un'espressione confusa nel testo a cui ti riferisci. La matrice diadica o prodotto diadico, in termini matematici, è generalmente un concetto diverso dal concetto di rotazione. In matematica e fisica, un prodotto diadico è il prodotto di due vettori che dà come risultato una matrice. Formalmente, date due colonne vettori **a** e **b**, il prodotto diadico **abᵀ** (dove **bᵀ** rappresenta il trasposto del vettore **b**) è una matrice il cui elemento nel i-esimo riga e j-esimo colonna è dato da **aᵢbⱼ**. Le matrici diadiche sono spesso utili in meccanica e fisica, per esempio nello studio dei tensori di stress o nelle proprietà di trasformazione di altri tensori fisici. In termini di cinetica o cinematica, quando si parla di rotazioni si fa riferimento a matrici di rotazione, che sono rappresentazioni speciali di trasformazioni lineari che descrivono come un oggetto rotato appare in un diverso sistema di riferimento. Una matrice di rotazione è un tipo di matrice ortogonale che ha la particolare proprietà di preservare la lunghezza dei vettori e l'angolo tra di loro, rappresentando una trasformazione conservativa come una rotazione nello spazio. La confusione potrebbe sorgere se il contesto in cui \\"matrice diadica\\" viene usato non è chiaro o se ci sono errori di traduzione o interpretazione del testo in cui appare il termine. Proprio per questo motivo, senza un contesto specifico in cui \\"matrice diadica\\" viene utilizzata in relazione con una rotazione, è difficile fornire una spiegazione esatta di ciò che si intende. Se hai ulteriori dettagli o un contesto più specifico, posso cercare di fornire un'interpretazione più precisa."},{"prompt":"Per ottenere informazioni sull'assetto, dobbiamo generare un momento angolare integrale del movimento. Poiché non sono presenti coppie applicate esterne sul sistema, il momento angolare totale del sistema H rispetto al centro di massa del sistema è un vettore costante nello spazio inerziale. Prima che inizi la manovra del robot, assumiamo che l'assetto inerziale del satellite è fisso, quindi non esiste momento angolare del sistema e il vettore costante è quindi il vettore zero. Il momento angolare di ciascun corpo rispetto al centro di massa del sistema è il prodotto scalare dell'inerzia diadica del corpo rispetto al centro di massa del sistema, con la velocità angolare del corpo: era riferito a questo","completion":"Grazie per il chiarimento. La discussione riguarda la dinamica del sistema robot-satellite e il concetto di momento angolare in meccanica classica. Il tuo testo indica che, per un sistema isolato nello spazio (nello specifico, un satellite con un braccio robotico montato), il momento angolare totale rispetto al centro di massa del sistema è conservato se non agiscono coppie esterne. Questo principio si basa sulla conservazione del momento angolare, che afferma che se nessuna coppia esterna agisce su un sistema, il suo momento angolare rimarrà costante. Quando dici \\"inerzia diadica\\", si fa riferimento ad un concetto più comune noto come \\"tensore d'inerzia\\" o \\"matrice d'inerzia\\". Il tensore d'inerzia è un ente matematico che descrive come la massa di un corpo è distribuita in relazione al suo centro di massa e viene utilizzato per calcolare il momento angolare di un corpo rigido in rotazione. In termini matematici, il tensore d'inerzia è una matrice simmetrica, e la sua applicazione sulla velocità angolare di un corpo fornisce il momento angolare. Quindi il passaggio che hai fornito sta descrivendo il modo in cui si calcola il momento angolare individuale di un corpo rigido (nel tuo caso le singole parti del satellite e del braccio robotico) utilizzando la loro matrice d'inerzia e la loro velocità angolare. Nell'esempio considerato, si presume che prima dell'inizio della manovra del robot, il satellite non abbia momento angolare iniziale nel suo assetto inerziale, il che significa che è in una condizione stazionaria o che ruota con una velocità angolare costante tale che il momento angolare totale del sistema satellite-robot è zero. In altre parole, per analizzare il movimento del sistema quando il robot inizia a muoversi, si deve tener conto di come questa manovra influisca sul momento angolare del sistema, che resterà costante in assenza di forze esterne. Il cambio di velocità angolare del robot dovuto alla manovra dovrà essere compensato da un cambiamento opposto della velocità angolare del satellite, mantenendo costante il momento angolare totale del sistema in accordo con la legge di conservazione del momento angolare."},{"prompt":"Write an excerpt for a dialogue, exposition-filled, martial-arts action-filled, gunplay-action filled post-apocalyptic science fiction, urban fantasy, dark fantasy, Chinese wuxia cultivation style, Japanese light novel style military techno-thriller war story novel in the form of crossover fanfic between the Muv-Luv franchise, Fire Force, Naruto, Date a Live, My Hero Academia, Hundred, IS: Infinite Stratos, Aria of the Scarlet Ammo, Tenchi Muyo.

Within its halls walked Hiashi, once shrouded in the infamy of All for One, now a man shedding his past for a new destiny. The palatial room illuminated as the interlocking gears of an IS unit powered down, the pilot stepping forth—a testament to the Ōtsutsuki’s celestial might. Hiashi's gaze, distant and contemplative, betrayed a man weary of war, seeking solace in life’s simpler shades. In a corner, a group of hooded Diva sat in quiet discussion, their very presence enough to remind him of the changes the world had endured—shifts in power that were both seismic and subtle, as heroes of old were rendered mere myths. \\"Mr. Midoriya,\\" addressed an approachable voice, cutting through the din of the martial drills and the hum of mechs. The speaker was an elder from the reestablished Shogunate, his ceremonial robes contrasting sharply with the functional attire of the Armed Detectives venturing beyond the dojo’s threshold. Hiashi turned, his red eyes flickering with curiosity. \\"Yes, Shogun Tokugawa. What news?\\" The Shogun adjusted his robes. \\"We've just received word from our newly appointed peacekeepers in the Unified Nations of East Asia. The first of the Armed Detective agencies has been established, taking the place of the former ninja clans.” A glint of satisfaction flashed across Hiashi’s face. \\"Good. And the populace?\\" \\"They are embracing the new guard,” the Shogun replied, confidently. \\"With our guidance, they see it not as an end, but as a renaissance. Your vision is becoming reality.\\" Hiashi turned away, peering out at the practice grounds where Tactical Surface Fighters engaged in mock combat with pyrokinetic Generations. An empire's might displayed in mechanical monoliths and arcane artistry. Later that evening, the scene had changed. The remnants of the day’s militaristic grandeur gave way to a softer, homelier setting. Hiashi sat in a quaint, albeit luxurious, dining hall with a woman whose smile outshone the opulence. Inko, innocent to the core, conversed lightly, her voice a soothing balm to the echo of Hiashi's past misdeeds. She knew him as the tycoon who had aided in their nation’s ascendancy—not the mastermind behind the shadows that had been dissolved by the unification's cleansing crucible. “To think, just a decade back, nobody would have believed that a man of such stature would court a simple florist like me,” she said, her laughter twinkling with an undiminished purity. “I have always found beauty in the unexpected, Inko,” Hiashi responded, his voice soft, yet earnest. “And there’s more to life than power and conquest. You have taught me that.” Their hands met across the table, her small fingers intertwining with his, a gesture bridging two separate worlds—hers of normalcy, and his of veiled legacies. Love had taken root, away from the theatrics of power; a bond woven in the quiet moments between tales of gunplay and wuxia alike. As night fell over the now-peaceful empire, Hiashi considered the path that led to this juncture. The battles fought, the lives altered, and the society he helped shape. Soon, he would be a father, guiding not an empire but a child—his heir, Izuku. How would he, a man so long defined by the shadow of All for One, embody the past to instruct the future? With the Meta Liberation Army no more and his old mantle discarded, could he foster a legacy without the taint of his previous life? Hiashi gazed at Inko, his resolve strengthened. Together, they would forge a new path—for themselves and for Izuku. A journey of love, challenge, and discovery, but most importantly, of hope. As the phoenix rises from the ashes, so too did Hiashi endeavor to rise—an enigma yielding at last to the simplest yet most profound of roles: a husband, a lover, a father. And beyond the reach of the empire's light, in the quiet that guards the eve of change, one could almost hear the soft vow of the former villain-turned-protector: to leave behind an empire of shadows for a future illuminated by love and peace."},{"prompt":"В придворном оркестре 13 флейтистов и 17 скрипачей.

Excerpt from **\\"Shadows of Jurai: Convergence of Destinies\\"** --- The night air was crisp in Kyoto, a city reborn from the ashes of calamities and now glistening with the fusion of ancient architecture and modern innovation. Standing atop a towering skyscraper akin to a modern-day castle, Hiashi Midoriya, the man once feared as the underworld kingpin 'All for One', gazed out at the sprawling expanse. His life had taken an unexpected turn, with the splintering of the Meta Liberation Army and the absorption of their territory into the vast empire ruled by the Ōtsutsuki clan. No longer did he need to dwell in the shadows, for the world he had sought to control no longer existed. Turning from the balcony, he entered the penthouse, where the soft strains of a piano filled the air. There, amidst walls lined with ancient scrolls and cutting-edge screens, he found solace. His past deeds — the stolen quirks, the puppeteering of crime — seemed like a life lived by another. Inko Shimura, the green-haired legacy of a line that had almost been lost to time, caught his eye as she approached. Her gentle expression carried a warmth that belied her sharp intellect. \\"Evening, Hiashi. Lost in your thoughts again?\\" Inko asked, her voice a soothing melody amid the chaotic symphony of their world. Hiashi smiled, an expression that was once rare. \\"Just marveling at how much has changed, Inko. The MLA, the underworld... none of it matters anymore.\\" Inko placed a comforting hand on his. \\"You've left that behind. Now, you're helping build something new — something better.\\" \\"It's not just me. It's because of the Ōtsutsuki clan. Bringing together the IS units, the Tactical Surface Fighters... They've shown us a new way to protect our nation. An Armed Detective system rather than shinobi clans or heroes,\\" Hiashi replied, his gaze hardening slightly with determination. \\"And what of us, Hiashi? What do we build together?\\" Inko's question was pointed, full of hope and expectation. Hiashi turned to her, the shadows of his past retreating in the light of her presence. \\"A future, Inko. A legacy that goes beyond power and control. One where our son can grow up free from the strife that once defined our lives.\\" Inko moved closer, her eyes glistening. \\"A world where Izuku can dream, unburdened by the legacies of the past.\\" Together, they stood, looking out at the city that throbbed with life and possibility. Hiashi Midoriya, having laid down the mantle of 'All for One', was ready to embrace a new title — that of a father, a husband, and a man dedicated to a future written not in the dark ink of villainy, but in the vibrant colors of family, love, and peace. As they turned from the window, Hiashi wrapped an arm around Inko, and they walked back into the heart of their home, leaving the panoramic vista of the empire behind. It was there, in the quiet moments before they would share dinner and laughter, that Hiashi realized the true power of redemption and the uncharted path of a life reborn. --- This tale of love amongst empires and legacies intertwines the high-stakes combat of wuxia with the intrigue of military technothrillers, the mystique of urban fantasies, and the ambition of a science fiction saga, while chronicling the unexpected journey of a man stepping out of the night and into a dawn of his own making."},{"prompt":"For a site in the vicinity of a proposed dam, the vertical effective stress at a point 30 ft (9.144 m) below the ground surface was 3500 lb/ft2 (167.6 kPa) under dry conditions.

Plot a profile of total stress, effective stress and pore pressure to a depth of 50 ft for each of the following cases. The groundwater is at a depth of 10 ft (3.048 m) below the ground surface. A series of dewatering wells was installed, which caused the groundwater table to drop to a depth of 25 ft (7.62 m) below the ground surface. Over time, this area has been flooded by the dam and the water level has stabilized 25 ft (7.62 m) above the ground surface","completion":"Unfortunately, as a text-based AI model, I cannot generate visual plots. However, I can explain how to plot the profiles for each case and calculate the necessary stresses. To create the plots, you will need to have three separate lines for total stress (σ), pore water pressure (u), and effective stress (σ') with depth being the y-axis and stress being the x-axis. 1. For the ground conditions when the groundwater is at a depth of 10 ft below the ground surface: - Total stress (σ) increases linearly with depth due to the overburden soil. At any depth z, the total stress is given by σ = γ * z, where γ is the unit weight of the soil. - Pore water pressure (u) is zero above the water table (from ground surface to 10 ft depth) and increases linearly with depth below the water table due to the pressure exerted by the water column. At any depth z below the water table, u = γ_water * (z - depth of water table), where γ_water is the unit weight of water (typically 62.4 lb/ft³ or 9.81 kN/m³). - Effective stress (σ') is the difference between total stress and pore water pressure (σ' = σ - u). Plot all three stresses from the surface to 50 ft. You'll see that the effective stress is equal to the total stress down to the water table and then diverges as the pore pressure comes into play. 2. For the ground conditions when the groundwater table is at a depth of 25 ft due to dewatering wells: - Follow the same procedure as in case 1. However, the pore water pressure will begin to exert influence only below 25 ft depth. Adjust your calculations accordingly, noting the pore water pressure at 30 ft was initially 3500 lb/ft². Now, with a lowered water table, the effective stress at this depth will be higher since the pore pressure contribution will be less. 3. For conditions when the water level has risen 25 ft above the ground surface: - Calculate the total stress as before, with the soil unit weight up to the ground level and then adding the water unit weight for the additional 25 ft. - Pore water pressure will start from the new water level, essentially being negative or \\"suction\\" from the original ground surface to the new water level, where it will be zero, then will again be calculated as per case 1 from that point to below the ground surface. - Again, effective stress is the total stress minus the pore water pressure. When you manually calculate the numbers at different depths, you can draw these profiles on graph paper or use a spreadsheet program like Excel to chart the stresses. Remember that the effective stress at any point is critical since it directly influences soil behavior."},{"prompt":"Write an excerpt for a dialogue, exposition-filled, martial-arts action-filled, gunplay-action filled post-apocalyptic science fiction, urban fantasy, dark fantasy, Chinese wuxia cultivation style, Japanese light novel style military techno-thriller war story novel in the form of crossover fanfic between the Muv-Luv franchise, Fire Force, Naruto, Date a Live, My Hero Academia, Hundred, IS: Infinite Stratos, Aria of the Scarlet Ammo, Tenchi Muyo.

Midoriya Hiashi, once feared under the alias \\"All for One,\\" now a ghost slipping through the folds of history, shared the space with another—a woman whose essence was as delicate as cherry blossoms in spring, yet not to be underestimated. Hiashi, abandoning his pursuit of shadowed dominion, found himself at the crossroads of destiny, where his heart beckoned louder than ambition's siren song. The room's silence was broken by his companion's melodic voice. Inko, unaffected by the perilous past of her partner, spoke with genuine affection woven through her words. \\"In a world rebuilding from calamity, where power once unraveled the very fabric of society,\\" she said, \\"your decision to forsake that path… it's nothing short of remarkable, Hiashi.\\" A faint smile flickered across his lips. \\"The era of martial strength, pyrokinetic prowess, and militarized machinations—such struggles gave birth to my name. But it was empty.\\" Hiashi slid closer, the light catching the earnestness in his eyes. \\"Only in your presence do the shadows of 'All for One' truly dissipate.\\" Inko's eyes softened, her hand finding his. \\"And yet, this world, torn by the unrelenting tides of war and conquest—will it ever allow a man like you to live in peace?\\" \\"Peace is but a distant battlefield to conquer,\\" Hiashi responded thoughtfully, \\"The Ōtsutsuki clan with their infinite reach, the Jurai powers, the Tactical Surface Fighters—these symbols of authority and might shape our present. But now, we weave a different tapestry, one where centuries-old empires no longer define who we are.\\" His fingers traced the lines of her palm, tracing the future they might one day share. \\"I have walked among emperors and shoguns. Yet it is in this quiet space with you where I sense the echoes of a love story yet untold.\\" In a world where pyrokinesis melted into the ancient tactics of shinobi warfare, where mechs soared through a steel-gray sky, the unlikeliest of romances bloomed. It was a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. \\"Shall we see where this story leads?\\" Inko's question hung in the air, fragile and hopeful. Hiashi drew her close, the weight of all that he once was—an underworld king now fading into a whisper of dawn against the burgeoning light of what he was becoming. \\"Together, under the watchful eyes of a new empire, we will find our path.\\" Their tender compromise—a life woven from the remnants of a fractured world and the promise of a future where technology, magic, and ancient bloodlines mingled—stood as a beacon. And perhaps, in the pages to come, their dance at the heart of an era would unveil the true meaning of power wielded not with fists or fire, but with the enduring strength of love. As night embraced Kyoto, the whispers of the past settled like dust, and the small room, with its flickering lanterns and two solitary souls, became a sanctuary of serenity in the midst of a world still searching for its peace."},{"prompt":"Write an excerpt for a dialogue, exposition-filled, martial-arts action-filled, gunplay-action filled post-apocalyptic science fiction, urban fantasy, dark fantasy, Chinese wuxia cultivation style, Japanese light novel style military techno-thriller war story novel in the form of crossover fanfic between the Muv-Luv franchise, Fire Force, Naruto, Date a Live, My Hero Academia, Hundred, IS: Infinite Stratos, Aria of the Scarlet Ammo, Tenchi Muyo.

The Ōtsutsuki, with their ancient Jurai bloodlines, ruled with an iron grip, veiled in divine mystique. The air buzzed with the hum of IS units patrolling the sky, while the colossal Tactical Surface Fighters guarded the city's colossal gates, remnants of the old world mingling with the new. Amidst this backdrop, in a dim, elegant teahouse veiled by cherry blossoms, Midoriya Hiashi ditched his black coat symbolizing his underworld ties and donned the garb of an affluent businessman. Opposite him, the ever-cautious Inko Shimura dipped her fingers into a steaming cup of tea, her eyes harborings a mix of curiosity and caution. Hiashi offered a calm smile, schooling his features to hide the tempest within. \\"It's a new era, Inko. The clash of heroes and villains belongs to a time of chaos that's now behind us. We stand on the precipice of a world united, and I've decided to leave old... affiliations, and invest in the future.\\" Inko glanced up, her expression softening. \\"We all have pasts we're not proud of. It's what we choose to do now that defines us, Hiashi. But why choose me? Why step out of the shadows now?\\" \\"They burned brightly, those flames of the old wars,\\" Hiashi mused, motioning outside where Generations of pyrokinetics walked in peaceful step with ordinary citizens. \\"But even stars burn out, leaving space for a new dawn. You, Inko, you have the light of that new dawn in your eyes.\\" A blush colored Inko's cheeks, her heart betrayed by the flutter she felt. \\"Hiashi, that's... You have quite a way with words.\\" \\"Only the truth,\\" he assured her. \\"Just like the magic of this post-Cataclysm world, you astonish and inspire me.\\" They spoke of simple things after that: hopes, dreams, and the future they could forge in this empire where armed detectives were the new guardians of peace, and where the very notion of heroes had become a distant concept. Hiashi learned of Inko's passion for nurturing life, her green thumb that could coax the most beautiful flowers from Kyoto's war-scarred soil. The hour grew later, and as the teahouse prepared to close, Hiashi took a breath to cast his final spell of the night. \\"Inko, would you allow me the honor of building something with you—a life, a family? There are no more battles to be fought, only a world to be won with love and unity.\\" In her eyes, Hiashi saw not the reflection of his past—the Deceiver, the Giver, the Stealer of power—but the potential of a future unblemished by villainy. And in that moment, he knew the Ōtsutsuki, with all their splendor and conquest, could not compare to the simple, profound victory he found in Inko's shy, hopeful smile. As the empire of the Ōtsutsuki loomed in the stars above and the steel and magic of a new age whispered in the streets, Hiashi found his redemption not in conquest or power, but in the kind, loving gaze of the woman who saw him not for the villain he had been, but for the husband and father he wished to be."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

Email #1, from Albert: Dear Sir, Thank you for your reply. The amount involved is 18.5M. The detail is that There Were Series Of Contracts Executed By A Consortium Of Multi-Nationals In The Oil Industry In Favor Of my Corporation, NNPC. The Original Value Of These Contracts Were Deliberately Over-Invoiced for our personal use. It must interest you to know that the Companies that Actually Executed these Contracts (CHEVRON) Have Been Fully Paid And The Projects Officially Commissioned. It is the Over Invoiced that I and my Colleague who is the director of Project have agreed to transfer which is currently in the suspense account of my Corporation to a foreign account for Subsequent Investment, Since We, Civil Servants Are Prohibited By The Code Of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Law) From Operating Foreign Accounts In Our Names. Needless To Say, The Trust Reposed On You At This Juncture Is Enormous. It is for this reason that I am asked by my colleague to seek the assistance of a foreign partner with the intention to receive this money for investment for us. Meanwhile,you are also assured that while transferring the fund, every precaution MUST be taken to give the fund's movement a legal back up. The fund was deliberately floated in the Suspense account of the Corporation and will be transferred to any designated account as a contract payment from the Corporation. With this, you will have no problem receiving the money. We will provide all necessary documents and stating the details of the contract, all approvals shall also be made and sent to you for record purpose. Arrangement for this is almost at the concluding stage, therefore, there is absolutely nothing to be afraid of as it is 100% legit. We Need also to be aware of your country's position on fund transfer because currently, the President of my country is taking stringent measures on Money Laundering. Therefore, We must take some extra care to avoid any illegal steps while transferring the investment fund into your country. At the successful transfer of the fund into your account, we will have to invest abroad with you as my partner since you are conversant with the investment climate in your country.let me have details and modalities for this considering the Socio and Economic factors and the areas of your choice. Perhaps we can invest in Real Estates. On the contrary, the fund can be shared on an agreed percentage between me and my colleague on one side and you on the other side if that is what you want. All that is more important to us is to get the fund conveniently transferred out of this country into a foreign account. Looking forward to hearing from you so that I can give you further details. Best regards, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Email #2, from Cameron: Dear <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Thank you for your email and for providing me with more details regarding the transfer of funds.

Could you please provide me with more details about the process of transferring the funds to a designated account? I want to make sure that all necessary precautions are taken to give the fund’s movement a legal backing. It would be helpful if you could outline the steps involved and any important documents that will be required for the transfer. Additionally, I appreciate your concern regarding my country’s position on fund transfers and the measures being taken against money laundering. I can assure you that my country also takes these matters very seriously, and I will ensure that all necessary legal steps are followed to prevent any complications. If there are any specific procedures or requirements that I need to be aware of, please let me know, and I will do my best to comply. Furthermore, I am open to discussing possible investment opportunities for the transferred funds.

In the great year of our Lord, 1944, a vast epic unfolded on the shores of Normandy, a coastal realm in the kingdom of France, troubled by the yoke of a dark empire known as the Third Reich, whose rule was spreading across the continent. This epic tale begins with a grand alliance of noble houses: the mighty kingdoms of Britannia, America, Canada, and their loyal vassals, united under the banner of the fabled leader, King General Dwight of the House of Eisenhower. Together, they hatched a plan of such audacity and risk that its like had not been seen since the days of Agincourt or the Crusades. Under the shroud of night, a flotilla of vessels bearing the alliance's steadfast warriors journeyed across the treacherous waters of the Channel Sea. Among these warriors were knights encased in steel, archers carrying bows that spat thunder and flame, and sappers skilled in the arts of siege craft. In their company traveled bards, to later sing of their deeds, and wise men versed in the strategy of war. As dawn broke upon the fifth day of the sixth month, the landings, codenamed Operation Neptune, commenced upon five stretches of sand and stone that would become immortalized as the beaches of Omaha, Utah, Juno, Sword, and Gold. The seas roared and the skies cracked with the thunder of artillery, sent forth from the ships of the alliance and the dark empire's fortified ramparts. The brave infantrymen, squires of liberty, stormed the beaches, with many cut down by storms of arrows (machine gun fire) and stones (artillery). Unperturbed, ladders and siege towers (landing crafts) reached the shore, depositing the forces of good upon the sand where they clashed with the empire's soldiers in fierce melee. Above, skilled falconers (pilots) launched their metal birds of prey into the blue, dueling with the empire's own beasts in a deadly dance for dominion of the skies. These mechanical griffins clashed with one another, spewing forth fireballs and casting down adversaries to crash upon earth and sea. Sorcerers of signals (communications officers) wove great magic to blind and confuse the dark empire's sentinels, while healers worked tirelessly in the field to mend the wounded and fallen, invoking arts both ancient and newly crafted. Each patch of land and each hamlet liberated from the shadow of oppression was celebrated as a victory in a larger, unfolding siege. The Battle of Normandy would be but one chapter in the greater war, a long and arduous campaign that would stretch through many terrains and seasons, recorded by keepers of the annals to remind the future of the valor that won back the world from the grip of avarice and tyranny. It would be a tale recounted through generations, a legend of the struggle for the light of freedom against the darkness of domination."},{"prompt":"crea in inglese un prompt per un'immagine di un centauro sull' harley davidson , la moto , un'immagine fantastica con vari elementi di avventura , fantasy, colore","completion":"Imagine a centaur, not the ordinary mythological figure you know, but an adventurous spirit breaking the boundaries of fantasy and reality.

This appearance doesn't usually indicate problems with the steel; it's a natural byproduct of the heating and cooling process. During the heat treatment process, high carbon steel is heated to a high temperature to change its crystalline structure, which is then \\"frozen\\" into place by cooling, typically rapidly, in a process known as quenching. The purpose of heat treatment is to enhance certain characteristics of the metal, such as its hardness and durability. After the quenching process, the steel is often reheated to a lower temperature in a process called tempering. This step is done to relieve stresses from the hardening process and to add toughness to the steel. The colors appear on the steel's surface when it is heated to specific temperature ranges during tempering. These colors result from a thin oxide layer that forms at these temperatures: - Light straw to yellow: around 204-220°C (400-430°F) - Brown to purple: around 227-260°C (440-500°F) - Dark purple to blue: around 260-290°C (500-550°F) - Light blue: around 293-315°C (560-600°F) - Grey to dark grey: over 316°C (600°F) Bladesmiths and metalworkers can use these colors as an indication of the steel's temperature and, by extension, its level of tempering. If the colors appear evenly distributed, it's likely a deliberate product of the manufacturing process. If they seem uneven or unintended, they might have been caused by an improper heat treatment or overheating at some point in the knife's use or manufacture. To maintain the quality of a high carbon steel blade, it's essential to keep it clean, dry, and oiled, as it's more prone to rusting than stainless steel. Avoid abrasive cleaning, which could remove the oxide layer. If you're unsure of your specific knife's maintenance requirements or the ideal method to preserve the tempering hues, consult the manufacturer or a knowledgeable knife smith for advice."},{"prompt":"To confirm- is the rainbow hue indicative of high carbon steel rather than stainless steel?","completion":"No, the presence of a rainbow hue, or tempering colors, is not exclusive to high carbon steel and isn't a definitive way to differentiate between high carbon and stainless steel. Both types of steel can display temper colors if they have undergone heat treatment processes that lead to the formation of an oxide layer on the surface. The hues occur due to thin-film interference from the oxide layer forming on the steel's surface at specific temperatures. While high carbon steels are commonly associated with these colors due to their frequent use in applications that require heat treatment, stainless steels can also be heat-treated for various purposes, and thus they can show similar tempering colors under the right conditions. The key difference generally lies in the properties and chemical composition of the metals. High carbon steel contains a higher amount of carbon (usually above 0.30%) and fewer other alloying elements, while stainless steel has a significant chromium content (at least 10.5%) making it resistant to corrosion. There are also many grades within each category with differing heat-treatment behaviors and responses. To determine if your knife is made from high carbon steel or stainless steel, you might need to consider other distinguishing factors, such as: - **Magnetism:** While both can be magnetic, some stainless steels (particularly those in the austenitic category, like 304 or 316) are not magnetic, whereas high carbon steels typically are. - **Corrosion resistance:** Stainless steel is more resistant to rust and staining compared to high carbon steel. - **Manufacturer's specifications:** Often, the surest way to identify the type of steel is to consult the manufacturer's documentation or reach out to them directly. There are also certain tests and tools that can identify the steel type, but these should be used cautiously as they could potentially damage the knife or alter its properties. If you need to have a definitive answer regarding the type of steel, and the information is not available through the manufacturer, consider taking the knife to a professional metallurgist or a well-equipped knife shop for analysis."},{"prompt":"How can I be more like Homelander?","completion":"It's important to clarify that Homelander is a fictional character from the comic book series \\"The Boys,\\" created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, and he is also portrayed in the television adaptation by actor Antony Starr. Homelander is depicted as a superhero with a twisted sense of morality, engaging in behavior that is often violent, selfish, and unethical. If your question is about emulating Homelander's superhero abilities or appearance, remember that these are fantasy elements suited to the realm of fiction and entertainment. In real life, one cannot acquire superhuman powers like flight, super-strength, or heat vision. However, if you're looking at the character of Homelander as a metaphor and wish to learn from the narrative of \\"The Boys\\" in a positive way, there are other, much more desirable qualities you could strive for, which may be inspired by the broader themes of the show and not by Homelander’s negative traits: 1. **Leadership:** Homelander is often seen as a leader. Work on your leadership skills, focusing on positive aspects like decision-making, communication, and teamwork. Cultivate genuine leadership abilities based on trust, integrity, and respect for others. 2. **Confidence:** Develop your self-confidence by setting and achieving personal goals, engaging in public speaking, or taking on new challenges. Confidence is key when it comes to making an impact in both your personal and professional life. 3. **Physical Fitness:** Homelander is portrayed as physically powerful. To improve your physical capabilities, maintain a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, a balanced diet, and taking care of your body. 4. **Public Speaking:** The character often addresses the public and media. Developing public speaking skills can help in many areas of life, including both personal and professional communication. 5. **Responsibility and Accountability:** Unlike Homelander, who often shirks responsibility, you can work on being accountable for your actions, taking responsibility, and understanding the impact of your actions on others and on society. Remember to embody positive characteristics that contribute to your personal development and the betterment of those around you. It's crucial to distinguish between entertainment and real life, and to strive for qualities that are constructive and beneficial rather than destructive or harmful. Lastly, if you're drawn to Homelander because he's perceived as strong or capable, explore other role models—both fictional and real—who display strength of character without the immoral behavior exhibited by Homelander. Look for individuals who embody positive traits like bravery, compassion, and altruism."},{"prompt":"On your last bit there, \\" ...positive traits like bravery, compassion, and altruism\\" what 3 converse traits would you attribute to Homelander?","completion":"Homelander, as depicted in both the comics and the TV series \\"The Boys,\\" embodies several negative traits that serve as a contrast to the positive characteristics you might look for in a role model. Three converse traits that can be attributed to Homelander include: 1. **Narcissism:** Homelander displays an inflated sense of self-importance and entitlement. He craves admiration and lacks empathy for others, traits commonly associated with narcissism. 2. **Manipulation:** He often uses his charisma and authority to manipulate others for his own benefit. His interactions are typically self-serving, and he shows little regard for the wellbeing of those he manipulates. 3. **Sociopathy:** Homelander exhibits a lack of conscience and moral responsibility. His actions often demonstrate a blatant disregard for the lives and rights of others, aligning with traits associated with sociopathy—such as a lack of remorse and an incapacity for genuine emotional connections. While these traits make Homelander an intriguing and complex character in a fictional narrative, they are harmful and destructive in real life. It's important to recognize that characters like Homelander are intended to critique and explore darker aspects of power and heroism, not to serve as real-life behavioral models."},{"prompt":"What is one with the self-importance of a Narcissist, but with a generous and providing spirit- one that (overly) thinks they are needed to provide for others?","completion":"A person who combines self-importance with a generous and providing spirit might be described as exhibiting traits consistent with \\"benevolent narcissism.\\" While \\"narcissism\\" typically carries negative connotations, emphasizing self-centeredness and a lack of empathy, \\"benevolent narcissism\\" is a less formal term used to describe individuals who still harbor an inflated sense of their own importance or superiority but also feel a strong desire to use their perceived greatness to help others. These individuals may be driven by a need for admiration and recognition, wanting others to view them as benefactors or saviors. Their generosity often comes with strings attached or is performed in such a way as to ensure they remain the focus of attention and gratitude. Following are some characteristics that might apply to an individual with a blend of narcissism and a providing spirit: - **Grandiose Philanthropy:** They might engage in acts of charity or generosity, but with the expectation of public acknowledgment or to gain social status. - **Paternalistic Behavior:** Such individuals may believe that they know what's best for others and can come across as condescending or patronizing, even when providing help. - **Savior Complex:** They may have a compulsive need to \\"rescue\\" people, often without regard for the agency or autonomy of those they are trying to help. - **Conditional Generosity:** Their giving or support may be conditional upon receiving praise, loyalty, or continued admiration from the recipients of their generosity. This type of behavior can lead to an imbalanced relationship dynamic where those being helped may feel indebted or inferior, and where the narcissistic benefactor feels indispensable and powerful. It's also important to note that diagnosing someone as a narcissist should be done by a qualified mental health professional, as narcissism is a complex personality trait and can be part of various personality disorders. If you recognize some of these traits in yourself or others and you find that they're impacting relationships or wellbeing, it might be worthwhile to explore this with a counselor or therapist who can provide strategies for developing healthier, more balanced interpersonal dynamics."},{"prompt":"Зачем нужны раунды в шифровании ?

Exploiting this observation allowed us to create a new method that is parametric yet still handles HI measurements that are beyond the sensitivity of the HI assay (9). We use a modification of metric MDS (25) to position the antigens and antisera in the map (9). This new approach offers computational advantages over the ordinal approach including reduced running time and fewer local minima, making it tractable to run on datasets the size of the one used in this manuscript, and on larger datasets. Antigenic map of human influenza A (H3N2) virus. We applied this method to mapping the antigenic evolution of human influenza A (H3N2) viruses, which became widespread in humans during the 1968 Hong Kong influenza pandemic and have been a major cause of influenza epidemics ever since. Antigenic data from 35 years of influenza surveillance between 1968 and 2003 were combined into a single dataset. We sequenced the HA1 domain of a subset of these virus isolates (26, 27) and restricted the antigenic analysis to these sequenced isolates to facilitate a direct comparison of antigenic and genetic evolution. The resulting antigenic dataset consisted of a table of 79 postinfection ferret antisera by 273 viral isolates, with 4215 individual HI measurements as entries in the table. Ninety-four of the isolates were from epidemics in the Netherlands, and 179 were from elsewhere in the world \\" I am trying to find their data but is not even in their supp material.

The antigenic data set comprises HI assay measurements taken over 35 years of influenza surveillance from 1968 to 2003. 2. The data set consists of a table with two major components: - Rows: Represented by 79 post-infection ferret antisera. These are sera collected from ferrets following infection, which contain antibodies specific to the influenza virus strains they were exposed to. - Columns: Represented by 273 viral isolates, which are strains of the influenza virus isolated during the surveillance effort. 3. There are 4215 individual HI measurements that make up the entries of the table. 4. A subset of the viral isolates has been sequenced, specifically the HA1 domain. The focus on sequenced isolates is mentioned, implying that the final data set may be restricted to those isolates with both antigenic (HI) and genetic (sequence) data available. 5. The geographic distribution of the isolates includes 94 from the Netherlands and 179 from other parts of the world. Unfortunately, without access to the actual data or supplementary material, we can only infer the structure of the data. However, it's likely to resemble a matrix where each cell represents an HI measurement corresponding to the reaction between a given antiserum (row) and a viral isolate (column). The HI measurement is a quantitative indication of the strength of the interaction between an antiserum and an isolate. The HI measurement values themselves can vary significantly, but the paragraph indicates that the researchers found a linear relationship to the logarithm of HI measurement. Nonetheless, without specific data points or ranges, it would not be possible to accurately recreate the measurements. Typical HI data might look something like this, in a simplified table format: | Antisera Viral Isolates | Isolate 1 | Isolate 2 | ... | Isolate 273 | | ------------------------- | --------- | --------- | --- | ----------- | | Antiserum 1 | HI value | HI value | ... | HI value | | Antiserum 2 | HI value | HI value | ... | HI value | | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | | Antiserum 79 | HI value | HI value | ... | HI value | To find the actual data, consider the following options: - Check whether the data set is available from the authors by contacting them directly. - Look for the data set in public databases that store viral antigenic and genetic data, such as the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) or related influenza research databases. - If the data isn't found in these places, it might be in a proprietary database or not publicly available due to privacy or security reasons."},{"prompt":"ok, based on those instructions of the data, create a simulated dataset","completion":"To create a simulated dataset loosely based on the description given, we'll start by deciding on the structure and characteristic values one might find in an HI assay dataset.

Let's assume: - HI values are integer scores typically ranging from 0 (no inhibition) to a maximum that is dataset-specific (for example, let's say 1024 as a typical dilution threshold), with higher values indicating stronger inhibition.

There is no one-size-fits-all answer, but here are some common strategies and considerations to help guide your investment decisions: 1. **Set Clear Goals**: Understand what you are investing for—whether it's retirement, a home down payment, education, or another financial goal. 2. **Build an Emergency Fund**: Before investing, it's often recommended to have an emergency fund of around 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses. 3. **Understand Risk Tolerance**: Assess your comfort with risk and potential losses. Higher-risk investments, like stocks, have the potential for higher returns but also higher losses. 4. **Diversify**: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading your investments across various asset classes (such as stocks, bonds, real estate) can reduce risk. 5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Your mix of investments (e.g., stocks, bonds, cash) should reflect your goals, risk tolerance, and time frame. 6. **Start Early and Invest Regularly**: Taking advantage of compound interest can significantly impact the growth of your investments over time, as can consistent investment through dollar-cost averaging. 7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and consider realigning your investments as necessary. 8. **Low-cost Index Funds and ETFs**: Many investors choose these for broad market exposure, lower fees, and the benefits of passive management. 9. **Educate Yourself**: The more you understand about investing, the better decisions you'll likely make. Consider reading books on investing, taking courses, or following reputable financial news sources. 10. **Retirement Accounts**: Utilize tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, or equivalent vehicles in your country. 11. **Consider Professional Advice**: A financial advisor or planner can offer personalized advice based on your specific situation. 12. **Mind the Taxes**: Consider the tax implications of your investments and how they fit into your overall tax strategy. 13. **Avoid High-Interest Debt**: Paying off high-interest debt may offer a better return on your money than some investments. 14. **Invest in Yourself**: Sometimes the best investment you can make is in your own skills and education to enhance your earning potential. 15. **Stay Committed**: It's important to stay committed to your long-term strategy and not be guided by short-term market fluctuations. It is highly recommended that before making any investment decisions, you thoroughly research or consult with a financial advisor to find the most suitable strategy for your individual circumstances. Remember that all investments carry some risk, and past performance does not guarantee future results."},{"prompt":"What is the best investment opportunity that yields the most money? Is it estate?","completion":"The investment opportunity that yields the most money can vary widely based on market conditions, timing, and the specific circumstances of the investor. Historically, different asset classes have taken turns being the top performer over various periods. Real estate, stocks, and businesses have all been considered high-return investments at different times, but each carries its own risks and considerations. Here's a brief overview of common high-yield investment opportunities: 1. **Stock Market**: Investing in stocks, especially in growth-oriented or small-cap companies, has the potential to yield substantial returns, but it also comes with a high level of risk. Stock investors can benefit from both capital gains and dividends. 2. **Real Estate**: Investing in real estate can provide significant returns through rental income, property value appreciation, and tax advantages. Real estate investments can be directly in properties or indirectly through Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). 3. **Private Businesses and Startups**: Investing in private companies, especially in the early stages, can result in very high returns if the business succeeds. However, this is also among the riskiest investments, as many startups fail. 4. **Venture Capital and Private Equity**: Similar to investing in private companies, this involves investing in funds that take stakes in private firms with the potential for high growth. These are typically only available to accredited investors due to their high risk and illiquidity. 5. **Commodities and Natural Resources**: Investing in commodities like gold, oil, and other natural resources can yield high returns, particularly during certain economic cycles. 6. **High-Yield Bonds**: Corporate bonds from companies with lower credit ratings, also known as junk bonds, offer higher interest rates but come with a higher risk of default. 7. **Cryptocurrencies**: Some investors have seen significant returns from investing in cryptocurrencies. However, this market is highly speculative, extremely volatile, and poses a risk of total loss. 8. **Hedge Funds**: These are investment funds that employ various strategies to create high returns for their investors. They're typically only accessible to accredited or high-net-worth individuals. Each investment type comes with its own set of risks, and it's important to understand these before investing. For instance, real estate requires substantial capital upfront and can be illiquid, meaning it’s not easy to sell quickly. It can also be management-intensive unless you invest through a REIT or other indirect method. To achieve higher returns, an investor typically has to accept a higher level of risk. It is crucial to diversify your investment portfolio to spread out risk. Often, the strategy that yields the most money for one investor may not be suitable for another due to different time horizons, capital availability, expertise, and risk tolerance. As always, due diligence and sometimes professional advice are key when deciding where to place your investment for the highest returns relative to your individual risk appetite."},{"prompt":"What is the best investment opportunity that generally promises the best return?","completion":"Investment opportunities that generally promise the best returns also come with higher risks. Historically, the stock market has been one of the best places for investors to achieve high long-term returns. More specifically, within the stock market, investing in individual stocks of well-performing companies or in growth sectors has the potential for substantial gains. Here's a brief look at some of the investment opportunities recognized for their higher potential returns: 1. **Equities (Stocks)**: Over long periods, stocks have historically provided high average annual returns. Within equities, growth stocks, small-cap stocks, and value stocks can have higher return potential, albeit with increased volatility and risk. 2. **Real Estate**: Over time, real estate investments have offered substantial returns via rental income and property value appreciation. Real estate can also provide diversification and potential tax advantages. 3. **Index Funds**: While not as high-returning as some individual stocks, broad market index funds afford good growth potential with lower risk by diversifying across many companies. They track the performance of market indices, such as the S&P 500. 4. **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)**: Similar to index funds, ETFs offer diversification and have the potential for solid returns. Some ETFs focus on high-growth sectors or strategies aimed at exceeding market returns. 5. **Mutual Funds**: Actively managed mutual funds, especially those targeting growth or sector-specific strategies, may offer substantial returns if managed effectively, though they typically come with higher fees. 6. **Private Equity and Venture Capital**: These high-risk, high-reward investments in private companies can potentially provide substantial returns if you have access to them and can commit capital over a longer time frame. 7. **Startups**: Investing in early-stage companies can lead to outsized gains if the companies become successful, but many startups fail, thus carrying a high risk of loss. 8. **Cryptocurrencies**: The crypto market has provided enormous returns for some early investors. However, its volatile and speculative nature makes it a very risky investment. It's important to note that \\"best return\\" is subjective and dependent on a person's investment horizon, risk tolerance, amount of capital, and understanding of the market. While stocks and real estate have historically provided strong returns over the long term, they can also experience significant short-term volatility and even long-term losses. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Diversifying your investments across different asset classes can help manage risk while still targeting robust returns. It's always recommended to research thoroughly and, if possible, seek advice from a financial advisor who can help tailor investment choices to your personal financial goals and risk profile. Remember, higher-return investments often come with the potential for higher losses."},{"prompt":"Describe the World War II Normandy battle as if it were a medieval vision","completion":"In a realm of ancient times, the saga of Normandy unfolds as a mighty contest of valor and steel. It is the year of our Lord 1944, and the dark shadow of a vile sorcerer, known in the annals of history as the Führer, has cast a pall across the continent of Europa. His legion of oppressors, the Axis, had ensorcelled many a land with their black magic and iron will. Yet, from across the great sea known as the Atlantic, a coalition of noble houses—Britannia, Amerigo, Canadia, and more—forged an alliance to break the curse and liberate the realm. In the month when summer solstice greeted the earth, under the cloak of starry night, a spell of silence was broken by the thunder of a thousand vessels and sky chariots. By the grace of Poseidon, the allied flotilla crossed treacherous waters, deceiving the dark lord's watchers and their sea serpents. In the dead of night, mystic pathfinders descended from the heavens to light the beacon fires, guiding the armada to the coast of the fabled land of Normandy, known for its emerald fields and fierce sea cliffs. As dawn broke on this fateful day, the horizon glowed with the fires of prophecy. The brave knights clad in steel, whose names were inscribed in the book of freedom, stormed the beaches—one realm known as Utah and Omaha, others christened Gold, Juno, and Sword. The defenders, enslaved minions of the Axis evil, unleashed a tempest of fire and metal upon the approaching liberators, turning sand and sea crimson with the blood of valiant souls. And so commenced the epic Battle of Normandy, a clash of titans foretold by seers. Siege engines, not of wood and rope but iron beasts called tanks, roared across the ramparts of tyranny. Mages wielding the power of gunpowder exchanged cataclysmic spells that ripped asunder the once-peaceful countryside. The skies were torn asunder by dragons of metal and bolts of lightning, as aerial knights of the alliance and the Axis dueled for supremacy, their valorous deeds sung by the winds. The beachhead, a crucible of chaos and valor, became a lodestone for the free peoples of the world, a beacon of hope against the looming darkness. Day by day, field by field, the allied forces, through great sacrifice and unyielding courage, fought to break the enchantments placed upon the land by the Axis sorcerers. The siege unfolded for many sun cycles, each day a legend in the making. Castles of tyranny fell; citadels of oppression surrendered. The people enslaved by the dark lord's magic stirred from their malaise, raising their own banners in revolt, their spirits rekindled by the light of liberty. Thus was fought the legendary Battle of Normandy. Heroes were forged in the crucible of war, names that would echo through the annals of history. The tale of their bravery and the shattered chains of oppression that followed would long be told by bards and chroniclers in the ages to come.

It is with the utmost respect for your profound impact on animation and storytelling that I, Cameron McCaffrey, reach out to you from the clutter of a world that can sometimes feel as chaotic as the pages of \\"The Horrible Bag of Terrible Things\\". I am currently volunteering at the front desk of the Boca Raton Achievement Center (BRAC), a place that shares in the belief of nurturing aspirations, much like the worlds you've so vividly brought to life. My journey has been one of conquest over personal challenges, having been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at a young age, to facing heart-wrenching adversity when I lost both my parents within nine short days in October of 2023. Your email correspondence through those dark days offered more solace than I can express, and it is a testament to the generosity embedded within your character. BRAC is a beacon for countless individuals striving to carve their paths in life, and much like Jenny Wakeman in \\"My Life as a Teenage Robot,\\" the center supports those who seek both discovery and self-improvement. The dignity with which Jenny explored her world and her role within it rings true for the tales unfolding within these walls every day. In light of our email exchanges that have given me wonderful glimpses into your experiences working with trailblazers like Genndy Tartakovsky, Craig McCracken, Robert Alvarez, and James Tim Walker, I am inspired to extend an invitation of deep significance. We at the Boca Raton Achievement Center would be truly honored if you would consider visiting our modest institution, providing our students with the invaluable opportunity to engage with a creative force such as yourself. Your presence would serve as a vivid bridge between aspiration and reality. Not only would our students benefit from your insights — shaping their creative fervor through your experiences — but also, your visit could act as an auspicious moment to share your forthcoming masterpiece, \\"The Twisted Tower of Endless Torment\\", with an audience that thrives on imaginative exploration. We understand that such a visit would represent a significant commitment on your part, considering the distance from California to Florida. Yet, I believe that the fulfillment garnered from inspiring the next generation of creators and visionaries is a journey worth embarking upon. As one of your admirers, I recall fond memories of the ecstatic joy your shows brought into my life, and I am eager to witness the spark of similar joy in the eyes of those at BRAC. The BRAC staff, including our executive director Evelyn Falconer, and benefactors like Jim and Marta Batmasian, ardently share my sentiment in assuring you a warm and celebratory welcome. Your rich tapestry of contributions to the arts would add a dimension of depth and wonder to our ongoing narrative of empowerment and achievement. Should you be inclined to visit, please know that the honor would be immeasurably ours, and I assure you that our community would do everything in their power to accommodate your schedule, comfort, and interests during your time at our center. Please feel free to reach out at your convenience to discuss any ideas or requirements you may have for your visit. We are prepared to accommodate your needs to make your time at BRAC both memorable and impactful. Thank you immensely for considering this invitation. Regardless of your decision, please know that your work has profoundly touched my life. I look forward to possibly welcoming you to the Boca Raton Achievement Center.

That dream has him working as a lumberjack. His dream is like a movie scene. That lumberjack is skinny and girly. He has boyish looks. He has a flirty and suggestive attitude. He wears daisy dukes and a short-sleeve shirt that is tied up in a knot. He first puts on his goggles, then his earmuffs, adjusts his work gloves and then puts on some nice lipstick. His chainsaw is heavy and 2 minutes in, his calves get dirty. The dream ends with him finishing cutting a tree. He suddenly wakes up.","completion":"INT. BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING The room is bathed in a serene blue hue of predawn light as a YOUNG MAN, KAI (19), athletic build with a youthful face, tosses and turns in his sleep. His brow furrows as if he's deeply ensnared in the grip of a dream. CUT TO: DREAM SEQUENCE: EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY A whimsical tune plays, faint at first but growing louder, as we see Kai, now transformed. He's notably skinnier, his features softened, giving him a girly charm. His boyish looks are accentuated by his choice of work attire: tiny daisy dukes and a checkered short-sleeve shirt tied up to reveal a smooth midriff. KAI (VO) (whispers dreamily) This is no ordinary forest, and I... am no ordinary lumberjack. Kai faces the camera with a flirty wink and begins getting ready for his job as a lumberjack in this fantastical woodland setting. The tension between his disarming appearance and the ruggedness of his profession is palpable. An upbeat, oddly fitting pop song plays in the background. Kai delicately slips on his safety goggles with a coy smile. He places the earmuffs over his ears with care, ensuring his hair remains perfectly styled. His work gloves snap around his wrists with a dramatic flourish. But then, in a surprising turn, he pulls out a stick of lipstick, a vibrant shade that stands out against the lush greenery of the forest. With precision, he applies it, puckering his lips in the reflection of a shiny axe blade. KAI (softly, to his reflection) Safety can still be sensual... Kai picks up his chainsaw, heavy in his slender arms. He starts it with a determined pull, the motor roaring to life, which contrasts with his delicate appearance and sensual demeanor. As Kai approaches a formidable tree, his movements are exaggerated, almost performing each step, hips swaying as he positions himself to cut. The camera follows the glint in his eye and the playful bite of his lip as he braces himself against the mighty chainsaw. KAI (VO) (playfully) Let's dance, my leafy friend. He engages the chainsaw with the tree, and sawdust begins to whirl in an entrancing cloud around him. Two excruciating minutes later, we see the toll the job has taken—his calves are now covered in dirt and debris, smudging his impeccable presence. The tree starts creaking, ready to fall, and Kai steps back, planting a work boot against the soil, his body language equal parts dramatic and flimsy. KAI (yelling, theatrically) Timber! The forest seems to pause in anticipation before the mighty tree descends with a ground-shaking THUD. Kai blows a kiss to the fallen timber, the scene reaching a kitschy climax. CUT TO: INT. BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING Suddenly, Kai's eyes snap open. He's awake, looking disoriented, the early morning sunlight filtering through the curtains and washing over his real-life masculine physique. KAI (breathing heavily, mumbling to himself) What...the heck was that? He sits up, running his hands through his hair, trying to reconcile the bizarre dream with reality. He glances at his plain bedroom, then down at his own body, confirming the strange juxtaposition of his subconscious adventures. KAI (VO) (softly chuckles) Maybe...just maybe, I need to lay off the late-night anime binges. Kai rubs his eyes, a bemused smile on his face as he prepares to face the real world — one where trees and chainsaws are, mercifully, nowhere in sight."},{"prompt":"Write an episode of Hetalia about the nations discussing ugly uniforms.

The banners of several nations hang from the walls, and a large round table dominated the center of the room. FADE IN: Japan, England, France, Italy, Germany and Prussia, along with several other nations, are milling around the conference room, waiting for the meeting to start. Prussia, sporting his usual confident grin, is the first to break the ice. PRUSSIA: \\"Hey, why are we even here if America and Russia can skip out to go fishing?

Aesthetic is secondary.\\" PRUSSIA: (chuckling) \\"Speaking of disasters, did any of you ever see those Rhodesian brushstroke shorts?\\" Confused mumblings spread around the table as nations try to recall what Prussia is talking about. FRANCE: \\"Ah, yes, the Rhodesian camouflage, c'est très unique, but I can't say it was much of a fashion statement.\\" ENGLAND: (with a grimace) \\"Those shorts...you could see them from a mile away, and in the bush, that's not exactly what you'd want.\\" ITALY: (tilting his head) \\"But maybe they were just trying to be...um...fashion-forward?\\" JAPAN: (thoughtful) \\"On a tactical level, I understand the camouflage effectiveness, but the cut of the shorts...not so much.\\" The nations continue to exchange banter, with each one poking fun at an instance of peculiar uniforms from their own or each other's history. ENGLAND: (chuckling) \\"Let's not forget the time America thought wearing flag pants was a good diplomatic statement.\\" PRUSSIA: (laughing) \\"Yikes! I heard the fashion police are still after him for that.\\" GERMANY: (sighs) \\"My brother, do you remember the picklehaube helmets?\\" PRUSSIA: (proudly) \\"Of course! That was a mark of Prussian discipline! Although I admit, they weren't particularly comfortable.\\" CANADA: (sheepishly) \\"Well, at least none of you have had a national police force known for their wide-brimmed hats and red coats.

Their traditional uniform includes a white pleated skirt and pompom shoes!\\" ITALY: (giggling) \\"It's like a ballet on the battleground!\\" Several nations laugh, while the room fills with a sense of camaraderie over shared fashion faux pas. Suddenly, the door flies open, and Sealand walks in with a vibrant, mismatched ensemble, blissfully unaware of the fashion critique session. SEALAND: \\"Hey, everyone! What'd I miss?\\" The nations turn to look at Sealand, trying to hide their smirks behind their hands. The awkwardness is palpable. PRUSSIA: (bursting into laughter) \\"Looks like we've got a new contender for boldest uniform right here!\\" The nations join in laughter as Sealand stands there, a confused but bright smile on his face, unaware that he's now the focus of the Hetalia uniform discussion. FADE OUT.

These games were officially announced by Nintendo on January 8, 2013, and were released worldwide for the Nintendo 3DS on October 12, 2013. They were the first games in the series to feature fully 3D polygonal graphics, and introduced players to the Kalos region, inspired by France, along with a new generation of Pokémon. Game Freak, the developer of the Pokémon games, introduced various new features with X and Y, including Mega Evolution and the Fairy type."},{"prompt":"When did development begin for Pokemon Black and White","completion":"Development for Pokémon Black and White began immediately after the completion of Pokémon Platinum, which would place the start of Black and White's development around late 2008. Junichi Masuda, the director of Pokémon Black and White, mentioned in an interview that development took about four years. Pokémon Black and White were first released in Japan in September 2010 and then rolled out to other regions in March 2011. These games introduced the Unova region and were the first games in the fifth generation of the Pokémon video game series."},{"prompt":"When did development begin for Pokemon Sun and Moon","completion":"Development for Pokémon Sun and Moon began around late 2013, following the release of Pokémon X and Y. The games were developed by Game Freak and published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS. Sun and Moon are the first installments in the seventh generation of Pokémon games and were officially announced on the franchise's 20th anniversary, February 27, 2016. These titles introduced the Hawaii-inspired Alola region and brought various new features into the franchise, including Alolan forms of pre-existing Pokémon, Z-Moves, and the removal of traditional gyms. Pokémon Sun and Moon were released worldwide on November 18, 2016, with a few European countries receiving the games slightly later, on November 23, 2016."},{"prompt":"When did development begin for Pokemon Sword and Shield","completion":"Development for Pokémon Sword and Shield began after the completion of Pokémon Sun and Moon, which was released in November 2016. Since the games were announced on February 27, 2019, during a Pokémon Direct presentation, the development likely started in 2017 or even earlier. Sword and Shield were released worldwide on November 15, 2019, and were developed by Game Freak for the Nintendo Switch. They are the first main series games in the eighth generation of the Pokémon franchise and introduced players to the Galar region, which is inspired by Great Britain. These games introduced features like Dynamax and Gigantamax transformations, the Wild Area, and also discarded some traditional elements such as Mega Evolutions and Z-Moves from previous generations."},{"prompt":"When did development begin for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet","completion":"Specific details about the exact start date of development for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have not been officially disclosed. However, in general, Pokémon games typically enter development several years before their release. Considering that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were announced on Pokémon Day, February 27, 2022, and released on November 18, 2022, it is likely that the development began at least 2-3 years prior to the announcement, which could place the beginning of development around 2019 or 2020. These games are the first entries in the ninth generation of the Pokémon series and include a number of new features and mechanics, such as a fully open-world design and the \\"Terastal\\" phenomenon that allows Pokémon to gain new forms and powers. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are developed by Game Freak for the Nintendo Switch and are set in a region inspired by the Iberian Peninsula."},{"prompt":"When did development begin for Pokemon Black 2 and White 2","completion":"Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 were officially announced in February 2012, and the games were released in June 2012 for Japan and later in October 2012 for North America and Europe. While the exact start date of their development has not been officially detailed, it's reasonable to infer that development began shortly after the release of Pokémon Black and White, which was in September 2010 in Japan and in March 2011 internationally. Given the typical development cycle of Pokémon games and the fact that Black 2 and White 2 are direct sequels, utilizing the same game engine and many assets from their predecessors, the development time was likely shorter than that of a brand-new generation. It is common for Game Freak to begin conceptualizing and working on new titles while the previous games are still being finalized or shortly after their release. Therefore, it's plausible that the development of Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 could have started as early as late 2010 or 2011. These assumptions are based on standard industry practices and the timelines between game releases."},{"prompt":"When did development begin for Pokemon Diamond and Pearl","completion":"Pokémon Diamond and Pearl were in development for several years before their release. While there isn't an exact publicly disclosed start date for the development of these games, they were released in Japan on September 28, 2006, and in the United States on April 22, 2007. Junichi Masuda, the game director and composer for Diamond and Pearl, revealed in interviews that the games took approximately three and a half years to develop. Given this information, it can be estimated that the development of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl likely began sometime in 2002 or early 2003. This development period encompasses the transition to the Nintendo DS platform, which offered new technical opportunities and challenges for Game Freak, such as the implementation of Wi-Fi connectivity for online battles and trading. Diamond and Pearl were the first games in the series released for the Nintendo DS and marked the beginning of the fourth generation of Pokémon games."},{"prompt":"When did development begin for Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire","completion":"Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, which were the first games in the series’ third generation and introduced players to the Hoenn region, began development in 2000, shortly after the completion of Pokémon Gold and Silver for the Game Boy Color. The games were developed over a span of three years, with a team that peaked at around 50 developers. Junichi Masuda, the director of Ruby and Sapphire, has discussed in various interviews the challenge they faced in moving from the Game Boy Color to the new Game Boy Advance hardware, which involved adapting to the new technical capabilities and widescreen format. Given the release dates of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire—November 2002 in Japan and March 2003 in North America—it can be inferred that the development process covered the period of 2000 to 2002 before finalizing the product for release."},{"prompt":"When did development begin for Pokemon Gold and Silver","completion":"The development of Pokémon Gold and Silver began around late 1997 or early 1998, following the release of Pokémon Red and Green (Blue in international versions) in 1996. These games took around three years to develop and posed a significant challenge due to the limitations of the Game Boy hardware and the initial absence of series creator Satoshi Tajiri, who was less involved in the early stages of development due to health issues. One of the most notable aspects of Gold and Silver's development was the contributions of Satoru Iwata, who was then the president of HAL Laboratory. Iwata was instrumental in creating compression tools that allowed the team to fit the Johto region, as well as the entirety of the Kanto region from the first games, into the Game Boy cartridge. Pokémon Gold and Silver were first released in Japan on November 21, 1999, followed by North American and Australian releases in October 2000 and European release in April 2001. These titles introduced the second generation of Pokémon and were lauded for their innovations, including a real-time clock with day/night cycles, breeding mechanics, and two new Pokémon types (Dark and Steel)."},{"prompt":"When did development begin for Pokemon Red and Green","completion":"Pokémon Red and Green, the games that started the iconic Pokémon series, had a particularly long and challenging development period. Development began in 1990 by the company that would become known as Game Freak, led by Satoshi Tajiri and <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. Tajiri was inspired by his childhood interest in collecting creatures, and with the advent of the Game Boy and its link cable feature, he envisioned a game where creatures could be traded between players. The development process for these games was fraught with financial difficulties, and it took approximately six years to complete. The extended development time was partly due to the team's inexperience and the ambitious nature of the project. Game Freak nearly faced bankruptcy during this period, and many of the staff went unpaid in the final stretch of the project. Satoshi Tajiri continued to work on the game even during those challenging times, fueled by his passion for the concept. Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto mentored the project, helping the team refine the games and get them ready for launch. In addition, composer Junichi Masuda worked on the entire game soundtrack using a PC-88, a Japanese home computer. Pokémon Red and Green were eventually released for the Game Boy in Japan on February 27, 1996. Due to the games' success in Japan, they were later localized and released as Pokémon Red and Blue in North America in 1998 and in Europe in 1999, helping to spark the international Pokémon phenomenon."},{"prompt":"When did pre-production begin for the Pokemon Best Wishes Anime","completion":"Pre-production for the Pokémon anime series titled \\"Best Wishes!\\" in Japan, known as \\"Pokémon: Black & White\\" in English-speaking territories, likely began well in advance of its Japanese television premiere date, which was September 23, 2010. Pre-production involves planning the arc of the series, scriptwriting, storyboarding, casting, and other preparatory work before full-scale production begins. Generally, pre-production for an anime series can start more than a year before the actual airing of the first episode, especially for an established franchise like Pokémon, where scheduling and coordination with the related video game releases are crucial. This would suggest that pre-production for the \\"Best Wishes!\\" season could have started as early as 2009 or even before, aligning with the development and eventual release of the Pokémon Black and White video games, which were closely tied to the new series in terms of setting and Pokémon species showcased. Though there are no official public statements specifying the exact dates when pre-production began, this timeline would make sense within the context of the industry and the planning required for a synchronized multimedia release strategy that the Pokémon franchise is known for."},{"prompt":"When did development begin for Pokemon Diamond and Pearl","completion":"The development of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl began after the completion of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, which were released for the Game Boy Advance in 2002 in Japan and 2003 internationally. Since Diamond and Pearl were released in 2006 in Japan and 2007 elsewhere, it's likely that the development of these titles started at least two to three years prior to their release, around 2003 or 2004. Junichi Masuda, the director of many Pokémon games including Diamond and Pearl, has spoken in interviews about the development process. Moving to the Nintendo DS platform posed new challenges and provided opportunities to utilize the system's dual screens and enhanced graphical capabilities. One of the significant advancements in Diamond and Pearl was the ability to connect globally via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, which represented a big leap in the series in terms of multiplayer capabilities. Considering the complexity of creating games for new hardware and the need to innovate in the Pokémon series, a development time of more than two years is consistent with industry standards and the practices of Game Freak. This would align with the idea of starting the development process shortly after the team completed work on the previous generation of Pokémon games."},{"prompt":"When did development start for Yu-Gi-Oh Zexal","completion":"\\"Yu-Gi-Oh!

Zexal\\" anime first aired in Japan on April 11, 2011. While there is no specific public information about the exact start date of the development for \\"Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal,\\" it is standard for anime series to begin the pre-production phase at least one year before airing. Given this, the development of \\"Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal\\" likely began in 2010 or possibly even earlier. As for the manga version, which sometimes runs concurrently with the anime's development and release, \\"Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal\\" began serialization in the December 2010 issue of V Jump, a Japanese magazine focused on new manga and card games related to popular anime.

Unfortunately, specific details regarding the exact start date of the development phase for \\"Power Rangers Megaforce\\" are not public information. However, the process of creating a Power Rangers season usually involves several stages, including writing, casting, costume and set design, localization of footage from the Super Sentai series, and production planning. Given that the series adapts footage from the Super Sentai franchise, with \\"Megaforce\\" specifically using footage from \\"Tensou Sentai Goseiger,\\" development for the Power Rangers adaptation would have begun after the decision was made on which Super Sentai series to adapt. Typically, there is about a year or two gap between the original airing of the Super Sentai series in Japan and the premiere of the Power Rangers adaptation in the United States. Considering \\"Tensou Sentai Goseiger\\" aired in Japan starting in 2010 and \\"Power Rangers Megaforce\\" premiered in early 2013, it is reasonable to speculate that the development for \\"Megaforce\\" started sometime in 2011 or 2012, allowing enough time for adaptation work, pre-production, production, and post-production before the series debut."},{"prompt":"When did development begin for Power Rangers Super Megaforce","completion":"\\"Power Rangers Super Megaforce\\" is the twenty-first season of the Power Rangers franchise and serves as the second season and continuation of \\"Power Rangers Megaforce.\\" It debuted on Nickelodeon on February 15, 2014.

This ensures a seamless transition in the storyline and character development, as well as an efficient use of production resources. \\"Power Rangers Super Megaforce\\" adapted footage, costumes, and props from the 35th series of the Super Sentai franchise, \\"Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger,\\" which originally aired in Japan in 2011. Considering the airing schedule and the usual production timeline of television series, it is fair to speculate that the development of \\"Super Megaforce\\" might have started as early as 2012 or during 2013, to allow time for adaptation decisions, story development, set and costume preparations, casting (if needed), and other essential pre-production processes before filming commenced."},{"prompt":"When did development begin for Power Rangers Dino Charge","completion":"\\"Power Rangers Dino Charge\\" is the twenty-second season of the Power Rangers franchise. It premiered on Nickelodeon on February 7, 2015. The series was adapted from the 37th season of the Super Sentai series called \\"Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger,\\" which aired in Japan in 2013. Though specific details on the start of the development for \\"Power Rangers Dino Charge\\" are not publicly disclosed, it's common for production to start at least a year before a show premieres. This includes pre-production activities like writing, casting, adapting the footage from the Super Sentai series, and creating costumes and sets. Given that \\"Power Rangers Super Megaforce\\" aired in 2014, production work for \\"Dino Charge\\" would logically follow relatively soon after \\"Super Megaforce\\" was well underway or nearly complete to maintain an efficient production schedule. With this in mind, it's reasonable to infer that development for \\"Power Rangers Dino Charge\\" likely started sometime in 2013 or 2014.

While there are no specific public records detailing the exact start of development for the series, we can make an educated guess based on the typical production timeline of a Power Rangers season. The season is based on the 39th season of the Super Sentai series, \\"Shuriken Sentai Ninninger,\\" which aired in Japan beginning in February 2015. Typically, Power Rangers production teams start working on a new season while the previous season is still airing. This includes initial planning, adaptation decisions, writing, and casting, which would suggest that pre-production activities for \\"Ninja Steel\\" likely began around a year prior to its premiere. Considering this usual timeframe, development for \\"Power Rangers Ninja Steel\\" probably started sometime in 2015 or early 2016, allowing sufficient time for pre-production, filming, and post-production before the series premiered in early 2017."},{"prompt":"When did development begin for Power Rangers Beast Morphers","completion":"\\"Power Rangers Beast Morphers\\" is the twenty-sixth season of the Power Rangers franchise, and it premiered on March 2, 2019. It was originally announced in February 2018 that \\"Power Rangers Beast Morphers\\" would air in 2019, making it the first season under the franchise's new owner, Hasbro, after acquiring it from Saban Brands in May 2018. While the exact date that development began is not public information, we can estimate that pre-production activities likely commenced shortly after the acquisition, with preliminary planning even possibly beginning before the announcement. Considering the show premiered in early 2019, it's reasonable to assume that development would have started at some point in 2018. \\"Beast Morphers\\" is adapted from the 36th season of the Super Sentai series, \\"Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters,\\" which originally aired in Japan in 2012. This adaptation choice was notable since \\"Go-Busters\\" was initially skipped over for earlier seasons of Power Rangers in favor of adapting later Super Sentai series. In the case of creating a new season of Power Rangers, development includes adapting the Japanese footage to fit the new narrative, writing scripts, designing new elements, casting, filming, and post-production work. Given the normal timescales associated with such work, and the fact that Hasbro would have wanted to solidify its vision for the series, development likely started early on in 2018 to allow for a seamless transition and ensure everything was ready for the 2019 launch."},{"prompt":"When did development begin for Power Rangers Dino Fury","completion":"\\"Power Rangers Dino Fury\\" is the twenty-eighth season of the Power Rangers franchise and premiered on February 20, 2021. As with other Power Rangers series, there is usually a significant lead time for development, which includes scriptwriting, casting, and production planning, as well as the process of adapting the chosen Super Sentai series to a Western audience. For \\"Dino Fury,\\" the Super Sentai series being adapted is \\"Kishiryu Sentai Ryusoulger,\\" which originally aired in Japan starting in March 2019. Considering the time needed for localization and production, it's likely that development for \\"Dino Fury\\" began at least one to two years prior to its premiere. While there is no public information detailing the exact start date of the development process for \\"Power Rangers Dino Fury,\\" it's reasonable to speculate that preliminary work began sometime in 2019, following the airing of the original Japanese source material and based on the show's premiere date in 2021. This would be in line with the typical timing for developing new seasons of the Power Rangers series. \\"Power Rangers Dino Fury\\" is notable for being the first season fully produced under the ownership of Hasbro, which acquired the franchise from Saban Brands in 2018. As such, Hasbro's planning process and production schedule for this new installment may have been formulated to both refresh the brand and align with its broader strategic goals for the franchise."},{"prompt":"When did development begin for Power Rangers RPM","completion":"\\"Power Rangers RPM\\" is the seventeenth season of the Power Rangers franchise, which debuted on March 7, 2009. Unfortunately, the specific start date for the development of \\"Power Rangers RPM\\" is not publicly available, but generally, a Power Rangers series goes through a varied development timeline that is initiated well before the show's premiere date. Taking into account the general timeline of a TV series production, pre-production activities such as writing, planning, casting, and adapting the corresponding Super Sentai footage typically begin at least a year in advance. For \\"Power Rangers RPM,\\" this would likely have been sometime in 2007 or early 2008, given that it adapts footage from the Super Sentai series \\"Engine Sentai Go-Onger,\\" which aired in Japan from February 2008 to February 2009. It's worth noting that \\"Power Rangers RPM\\" was believed to be the potential final season at the time due to the franchise's uncertain future after Disney decided to end production of new episodes. Despite this, \\"RPM\\" received praise for its writing and story, which deviated from the franchise's typical formula and presented a more serious and post-apocalyptic setting. After \\"RPM,\\" Saban Brands re-acquired the Power Rangers franchise in 2010, leading to the production of \\"Power Rangers Samurai\\" in 2011, which continued the series."},{"prompt":"When did pre-production begin for Power Rangers RPM","completion":"Pre-production for \\"Power Rangers RPM\\" would have included work on scripts, story arcs, set design, costumes, casting, and coordinating the adaptation of the source footage from \\"Engine Sentai Go-Onger,\\" the Super Sentai series from which \\"RPM\\" was adapted. Given that \\"Power Rangers RPM\\" premiered in March 2009, pre-production likely started at least several months to a year prior. \\"Power Rangers RPM\\" was unique due to its darker tone and more serious narrative. This required a more thoughtful approach during the pre-production phase to ensure the show's different mood and style were properly captured. Additionally, the series faced an unusual situation because it was produced during a time when it was presumed to be the final season of Power Rangers under Disney's ownership. With this in mind, it's reasonable to estimate that pre-production for \\"Power Rangers RPM\\" would have commenced sometime in late 2007 or early 2008 to facilitate a well-developed storyline and production design, leading up to the early 2009 premiere. However, without specific details from production records, this estimate is based on standard industry timelines for television production."},{"prompt":"When did Saban buy the rights to the Zyuranger footage","completion":"Saban Entertainment acquired the rights to use footage from \\"Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger,\\" the 16th season of the Super Sentai series, which became the basis for the first season of \\"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\\" This acquisition took place in the early 1990s. Haim Saban, the founder of Saban Entertainment, reportedly came across the Super Sentai series while in Japan and saw potential in adapting the show for Western audiences. After a lengthy process of pitching the idea to various networks and securing the rights, Saban Entertainment was able to create a pilot in 1992. The success of the pilot eventually led to the start of the Power Rangers franchise. \\"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\\" debuted on American television on August 28, 1993, with much of the action sequences and the iconic costumed heroes drawn directly from the \\"Zyuranger\\" footage. The exact year Saban obtained the rights is not specifically detailed in public records, but considering the timeline of the pilot and the debut of the show, the rights acquisition occurred sometime in the late 1980s to early 1990s, prior to the pilot's production. It was this key decision and the overall success of \\"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\\" that led to the longstanding tradition of adapting Super Sentai footage into what has become one of the most iconic franchises in children's television."},{"prompt":"When did Saban buy the rights to Gokaiger footage","completion":"Saban Brands re-acquired the Power Rangers franchise from Disney in 2010 and quickly announced plans to produce new content. As part of this transition back to Saban Brands, the company would have needed to secure the rights to new Super Sentai footage for future Power Rangers adaptations. \\"Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger\\" is the 35th season of the Super Sentai series, and it aired in Japan in 2011. Saban Brands utilized footage from \\"Gokaiger\\" to produce \\"Power Rangers Super Megaforce,\\" which is the sequel to \\"Power Rangers Megaforce\\" and began airing in 2014. There is no publicly available information that precisely states when Saban Brands acquired the rights to the \\"Gokaiger\\" footage specifically. However, given \\"Power Rangers Megaforce\\" aired in 2013, and \\"Super Megaforce\\" began airing in 2014, it's likely that the rights to use \\"Gokaiger\\" footage were acquired sometime between 2010 and 2012, in preparation for the back-to-back production schedules of these seasons. It's important to note that acquisitions of this nature might not be publicized, and the licensing deals can include rights to multiple seasons at once, rather than on a per-season basis. This would enable Saban Brands to plan several seasons ahead and allow for a continuous flow in Power Rangers' production and release schedules."},{"prompt":"When did Game Freak finish the completion of Pokemon Platinum","completion":"Pokémon Platinum, an enhanced version of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, was completed and released in Japan on September 13, 2008. It was later released in North America on March 22, 2009, in Europe on May 22, 2009, and in Australia on May 14, 2009. Typically, the completion of a game, known as \\"going gold,\\" occurs several weeks before the official release date to allow time for manufacturing and distribution. This means that the final version of Pokémon Platinum would have been finished sometime before its initial Japanese release in September 2008. However, the exact date of completion is not typically disclosed to the public and can vary depending on the project's specifics. The release of Pokémon Platinum brought new features compared to Diamond and Pearl, such as updated graphics, new areas to explore, changes to the game's plot, enhancements to the gameplay, and the addition of a new Battle Frontier, among other improvements."},{"prompt":"When did Game Freak finish the completion of Pokemon OmegaRuby and AlphaSapphire","completion":"Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the enhanced remakes of the original Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire games, were completed and released in Japan, North America, Australia, and South Korea on November 21, 2014, with the European release following shortly afterward on November 28, 2014. As is common in the video game industry, the completion of a game, or when the game is considered \\"gold\\", usually happens a few weeks before the official release to ensure there is sufficient time for the game to be manufactured, shipped, and stocked by retailers. While the exact completion date for Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire is not publicly known, it would likely have been in late September or October 2014 to meet the November release schedule. Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire brought the Hoenn region to the Nintendo 3DS with updated graphics, new Mega Evolutions, and the Primal Reversion mechanic for the legendary Pokémon Groudon and Kyogre. The games were well-received by fans and critics alike, praised for their improvements over the original titles while maintaining the charm and appeal of the third generation."},{"prompt":"When did Game Freak finish the completion of Pokemon Black and White","completion":"Pokémon Black and White were officially released in Japan on September 18, 2010, and they were later launched in North America, Europe, and Australia in March 2011. As with any video game, the completion, or \\"going gold,\\" would have occurred some time before the first release date to allow for manufacturing and distribution of the game cartridges. While the specific date when Pokémon Black and White were completed is not publicly disclosed, the games would have been finalized several weeks prior to the Japanese release date. Based on industry standards, this means Game Freak likely completed the games in late August or early September 2010. The release of Pokémon Black and White introduced the fifth generation of Pokémon and featured a completely new set of Pokémon, a practice not repeated since the first generation, along with a new region inspired by New York City, updated graphics, and a number of gameplay enhancements. They were designed to present a \\"new beginning\\" to the series and received praise for their innovations and fresh take on the Pokémon formula."},{"prompt":"When did Junichi Masuda visit France","completion":"Junichi Masuda, the director of many Pokémon games and one of the founding members of Game Freak, visited France prior to the development of Pokémon X and Y, which began back in 2010. While there is not a specific, publicly disclosed date for his visit, it is known that his trip to France served as an inspiration for the Kalos region in the games. In an interview, Junichi Masuda mentioned that he traveled to France to take in the country's culture, art, and cities to inform the design and atmosphere of Kalos. Given that Pokémon X and Y were announced in January 2013 and released in October of the same year, his visit likely took place in the early stages of development, around 2010 or shortly thereafter. The Kalos region in Pokémon X and Y draws many parallels to various locations and cultural aspects of France, including the in-game city of Lumiose City, which is visually reminiscent of Paris and features a structure that strongly resembles the Eiffel Tower."},{"prompt":"Which Heisei phase 2 Kamen Rider shows are adaptable for Saban Brands","completion":"Saban Brands, the company that owned the Power Rangers franchise and previously adapted Kamen Rider into American shows, had the potential to adapt any Kamen Rider series that it acquired the rights to. However, not every Kamen Rider series from the Heisei era \\"phase 2\\" (which started with Kamen Rider W and continued through Kamen Rider Zi-O, marking the end of the Heisei era) was adapted for an American audience. The only Kamen Rider series from the Heisei era that Saban Brands adapted was \\"Kamen Rider Ryuki,\\" which became \\"Kamen Rider Dragon Knight\\" and aired in 2009. However, \\"Dragon Knight\\" was adapted under Adness Entertainment, rather than being a direct undertaking by Saban Brands. The Heisei phase 2 Kamen Rider shows include: 1. Kamen Rider W (2009-2010) 2. Kamen Rider OOO (2010-2011) 3. Kamen Rider Fourze (2011-2012) 4. Kamen Rider Wizard (2012-2013) 5. Kamen Rider Gaim (2013-2014) 6. Kamen Rider Drive (2014-2015) 7. Kamen Rider Ghost (2015-2016) 8. Kamen Rider Ex-Aid (2016-2017) 9. Kamen Rider Build (2017-2018) 10. Kamen Rider Zi-O (2018-2019) Saban Brands, which was re-established in 2010 after Haim Saban purchased the Power Rangers back from Disney, had the potential to evaluate and adapt any of these, but it chose not to. Hypothetically, any of these series could be adaptable if a production company secured the rights and found creative and practical ways to Westernize the stories and characters for a new audience, as the Power Rangers series has successfully done with the Super Sentai footage. After Saban Brands sold Power Rangers to Hasbro in 2018, any potential for Saban to adapt further Kamen Rider series presumably transferred away from the company. The choice of which series to adapt would typically be driven by considerations such as similarity to popular Power Rangers themes, perceived marketability of the characters and suits, and the potential for toy sales. To date, there have been no subsequent Kamen Rider adaptations following \\"Kamen Rider Dragon Knight,\\" although the franchise remains popular within its native country, Japan."},{"prompt":"Which Heisei Phase 2 Kamen Rider Seasons could saban hypothetically adapt","completion":"Hypothetically, Saban Brands could have considered adapting any of the Heisei phase 2 Kamen Rider seasons, as long as they had the rights to do so. Each season had its unique themes, styles, and potential appeal for Western audiences. Below is a brief look at each Heisei phase 2 Kamen Rider series and elements that could be appealing for adaptation: 1. **Kamen Rider W (2009–2010)** - Features a detective theme, with two protagonists who merge into a single Kamen Rider. Its noir-inspired storytelling approach and the theme of duality could translate well to a Western audience. 2. **Kamen Rider OOO (2010–2011)** - Revolves around ancient powers and artifacts, combining themes of history and adventure that could engage viewers who enjoy mythology-based narratives. 3. **Kamen Rider Fourze (2011–2012)** - A high school setting with space travel and a focus on friendship and social connections, making it potentially relatable to a younger audience. 4. **Kamen Rider Wizard (2012–2013)** - Incorporates magic and fantasy elements, which are often popular in Western media. The show dealt with dark themes and had a strong visual style. 5. **Kamen Rider Gaim (2013–2014)** - Features a theme of dancing teams that fight using lock-based devices which summon powers from interdimensional beings. The combination of dance culture and a more mature, war-torn storyline could catch the interest of diverse demographics. 6. **Kamen Rider Drive (2014–2015)** - Cars and high-speed action are at the center of this series, which could be appealing for an audience that enjoys automotive themes and crime-fighting stories. 7. **Kamen Rider Ghost (2015–2016)** - Deals with supernatural themes and the quest for historical artifacts. Ghostly powers and a journey to collect iconic figures' souls could appeal to adventure genre fans. 8. **Kamen Rider Ex-Aid (2016–2017)** - Centers around video games, a universally popular theme that could resonate well with kids and gamers, plus the added aspect of the characters being doctors adds a unique twist. 9. **Kamen Rider Build (2017–2018)** - The concepts of science, alternate realities, and political intrigue are at play here, offering a mix of intellectual appeal and action. 10. **Kamen Rider Zi-O (2018–2019)** - Time travel and the celebration of Kamen Rider's history could be well-received, especially for nostalgic elements and a time-bending narrative. For any adaptation, the success would depend on the ability to translate the core elements of the series into something that resonates with Western culture and conventions of superhero storytelling—much like how Mighty Morphin Power Rangers adapted its source material. However, after \\"Kamen Rider Dragon Knight,\\" there hasn't been another American adaptation of a Kamen Rider series, despite the aforementioned series’ potential. It's important to note that whether or not a series is deemed suitable for adaptation also heavily depends on business decisions, including estimations of market viability, potential toy sales, and overall brand strategy. As of my knowledge cutoff date in March 2023, no additional Kamen Rider adaptations had been announced or released in the West since \\"Kamen Rider Dragon Knight.\\""},{"prompt":"Which Heisei Phase 2 Kamen Rider Seasons are unadaptable","completion":"It's not accurate to say that any Heisei Phase 2 Kamen Rider seasons are inherently \\"unadaptable,\\" as the potential to adapt a series largely depends on the creativity of the production team and the cultural sensibilities of the target audience. Each Kamen Rider series has unique themes and concepts that could be adapted with the proper approach, localization, and understanding of the target market. However, certain elements in each series could present challenges for adaptation, such as: 1. **Kamen Rider W** - The detective noir theme is less common in American children's shows, and the series' dual-protagonist transformation gimmick might be harder to market. 2. **Kamen Rider OOO** - The complexity of the O Medals system and the series' connection to ancient creatures might require a significant cultural adaptation for a Western audience. 3. **Kamen Rider Fourze** - Though the high school setting is relatable, the space theme might need careful integration to avoid feeling too far removed from the usual Power Rangers-style action. 4. **Kamen Rider Wizard** - The show's darker tone and heavy emphasis on magic might be difficult to balance with the lighter tone typically preferred in Western children's entertainment. 5. **Kamen Rider Gaim** - The mix of dance teams and ancient samurai themes could potentially clash, and the show's more mature, complex storyline dealing with inter-faction conflicts would need to be adapted with sensitivity to younger audiences. 6. **Kamen Rider Drive** - While cars are universally popular, the series' crime drama style and more mature procedural elements would need to be modified for a younger demographic. 7. **Kamen Rider Ghost** - The supernatural and historical elements might be challenging to adapt while maintaining accuracy and respect for the historical figures depicted. 8. **Kamen Rider Ex-Aid** - The video game theme could be a hit, but balancing gaming with medical drama might require careful storytelling to keep it engaging for kids. 9. **Kamen Rider Build** - The geopolitical and alternate universe elements could be too complex for younger viewers, and the show's dramatic narrative might need adjustment. 10. **Kamen Rider Zi-O** - The time-travel aspect and celebration of Kamen Rider history could be challenging to convey without a rich understanding of the franchise, and the presence of past Kamen Riders might complicate rights and backstory explanations. Ultimately, adaptability comes down to whether the production company can effectively localize the story for a new audience. Cultural differences, thematic depth, and complexity of the narrative are just some of the factors that can influence the decision. Moreover, a decision to adapt or not to adapt isn't always about content; it could be dictated by market trends, audience demand, the potential for toy sales, and suitability within a network's programming lineup. As of the latest updates before my knowledge cutoff in 2023, there have been no official announcements of new Kamen Rider adaptations after \\"Kamen Rider Dragon Knight.\\" The success of an adaptation is also dependent on how a new series aligns with the adapting company’s overall brand strategy and objectives."},{"prompt":"When did Saban buy the rights to the go-busters footage","completion":"Saban Brands, after re-acquiring the Power Rangers franchise from Disney in 2010, would have acquired the rights to adapt the \\"Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters\\" footage for \\"Power Rangers Beast Morphers\\" at some point prior to its production.

Given that the announcement for \\"Power Rangers Beast Morphers\\" was made in February 2018 with Saban Brands still involved, the rights acquisition would have occurred before this announcement. Production for \\"Beast Morphers\\" likely started shortly after Hasbro's announcement, with pre-production activities such as writing, casting, and set construction happening in advance. Therefore, while the exact date is unknown, it is reasonable to speculate that Saban Brands obtained the rights to \\"Go-Busters\\" sometime before early 2018 when Hasbro announced its plans for \\"Power Rangers Beast Morphers.\\" This season marked a significant shift in the franchise, both in terms of ownership changes and the decision to finally adapt \\"Go-Busters,\\" which had been previously skipped in favor of adapting \\"Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger\\" into \\"Power Rangers Dino Charge.\\""},{"prompt":"Write an anime scene about a young man having a odd dream.

We focus in on KAITO, an androgynous 17-year-old with a delicate frame and sharp, pixie-like features, as he steps into the clearing. Despite his slight build, he moves with an air of confidence and a flirty swagger that belies his appearance. The dreamlike ambiance is accompanied by orchestral music that crescendos as Kaito prepares himself for the day's labor. A soft mist blankets the scene. KAITO (humming playfully) Another day, another tree. Time to spruce things up! Kaito bends down elegantly, tying the laces of his sturdy boots. He straightens up, throwing his hair back in a dramatic and playful manner. The scene plays out like a cheeky parody of a rugged wilderness film. Kaito slides his goggles over his eyes with one hand, while the other seductively applies a vivid pink lipstick, puckering his lips at his reflection in the metal surface of a nearby chainsaw—his work partner for the day. He winks at his own reflection, the feminine charm juxtaposed with the traditionally masculine setting. CUT TO: EXT.

KAITO (to the chainsaw) Ready for some action, my dear? The chainsaw ROARS to life, echoing throughout the forest. Birds take flight. Kaito takes a sturdy stance and begins working on a tree—his movements rhythmic and hypnotic, yet accentuated with playful winks and hip sways. Footage intercuts between Kaito's flirty expressions and the aggressive cutting of the chainsaw. As sawdust flies, we zoom in on Kaito’s calves, now dappled with dirt and wood shards, contrasting with his carefully maintained appearance. He doesn't seem to mind, his focus is on the tree, the act feeling more like a dance than labor. KAITO (shouting over the noise) Is it just me, or is it getting hot out here? After a tiring two minutes, the tension in the score and in the air itself builds to a crescendo. The towering tree begins to wobble and finally falls with a thunderous crash, stirring up a cloud of dust around Kaito.

He glances around as if he's on stage, giving a little wink to a fluttering butterfly. The LUMBERJACK bends down, carefully slipping on his goggles, their straps pushing his sleek hair back. His movements are almost in slow motion, emphasising the reveal of his flirty personality through his actions. He snaps on the earmuffs, his lips parting in a slow, sensual manner.

Érico Veríssimo, mestre em tornar palpáveis as angústias e as esperanças humanas, possivelmente emprestaria sua voz lírica e cortante às florestas que clamam por justiça, aos rios que agonizam em silêncio, à fauna que se esvai como sombras ao crepúsculo, enquanto os responsáveis retornam ao palco do crime, impunes, como fantasmas que não podem ser tocados pelos dedos trêmulos da lei. Curvado sob o peso de uma legislação ambiental que ostenta ser uma das mais rigíferas no papel, mas claudica na prática, o estado brasileiro assiste à reincidência criminosa com olhos de quem contempla um quadro absurdo. O Instituto do Homem e Meio Ambiente da Amazônia (Imazon) revela arrasadoras estatísticas: mais de um terço dos desmatadores da Amazônia Legal reincidem em suas práticas predatórias. Passivos ambientais são acumulados como dívidas de jogo, com a diferença de que o credor - a natureza - tem pouca esperança de ressarcimento. Esta mazela, entretanto, não é um grito solitário: é apenas o eco de uma problemática arraigada na ineficácia do sistema de fiscalização e na aplicação ínviável das penalidades. O Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis (Ibama), esvaziado de recursos e alcance, encontra-se a braços com uma tarefa sisífica. Conforme o artigo publicado na revista \\"Nature\\" em 2018, o órgão sofreu cortes orçamentários que obstruem significativamente a capacidade de prevenir e reprimir danos ambientais – um convite aberto ao ciclo vicioso da transgressão e reincidência. As punições, quando chegam a ser um fato e não uma promessa, se desfiam na lentidão judicial e nas tramas da burocracia, criando um sentimento de impunidade que alimenta o ciclo infracional. Capítulo interessante é analisado pelo \\"Relatório sobre Crimes Ambientais\\" de 2020 pela Fundação Getúlio Vargas, que indica as multas como inibidoras pontuais de condutas ilegais, mas que, uma vez não pagas ou embargadas em litígios, perdem seu viés educacional e dissuasório. De que servem punições que se desvanecem como sereno ao sol? Qual, então, a solução para esse enredo que parece escrito com a tinta inapagável da irresponsabilidade humana e da negligência estatal? O caminho passa pela educação ambiental, severidade efetiva na aplicação das sanções e, crucialmente, pela ressignificação da relação entre o homem e seu ambiente. Cabe ao Brasil cumprir seu papel de guardião de um patrimônio que é não apenas nacional, mas da humanidade, e reescrever essa narrativa para que nossa Terra, palco de tantas majestades naturais, deixe de ser cenário de crimes que se repetem como um refrão trágico da modernidade."},{"prompt":"como \\"desintoxicar\\" de uma musica?","completion":"\\"Desintoxicar-se\\" de uma música geralmente significa reduzir ou eliminar a compulsão de ouvi-la incessantemente até que não se torne mais uma espécie de obsessão. Aqui estão algumas dicas para ajudar a aliviar o ciclo repetitivo de ouvir a mesma música: 1. Faça uma pausa: Dê a si mesmo um período sem ouvir a música em questão. Isso pode ajudar seu cérebro a \\"resetar\\" e diminuir a necessidade de ouvir a faixa. 2. Ouça novas músicas: Procure novas músicas ou gêneros que você ainda não explorou. A novidade pode capturar sua atenção e reduzir o foco na música que você está tentando evitar. 3. Crie listas de reprodução diversas: Montar playlists com uma variedade de músicas pode prevenir a fixação em uma única faixa. Tente incluir músicas de diferentes estilos e artistas. 4. Ocultar a música: Se você tem a música salva em playlists pessoais ou a ouve em uma plataforma de streaming, considere removê-la das suas listas ou ocultá-la para não ser tentado a reproduzi-la novamente. 5. Distração: Encontre atividades que exijam sua atenção plena, como esportes, jogos, leituras ou hobbies, para que você esteja menos propenso a focar na música. 6. Defina limites: Escolha ouvir a música apenas em certos momentos do dia ou em certas situações e, fora desses tempos, se comprometa a não tocar a música. 7. Meditação e Mindfulness: Práticas de meditação ou mindfulness podem ajudar a treinar sua mente a focar no presente, ajudando a aliviar os ciclos de pensamentos repetitivos, incluindo a compulsão por uma música. 8. Varie a mídia que você consome: Além de música, consuma outros tipos de mídia, como podcasts, audiobooks ou rádio, para dar um descanso à sua rotina musical. 9. Procure a origem do hábito: Avalie o que torna a música tão atraente ou o que você está sentindo ou evitando ao ouvi-la repetidamente. Às vezes, a \\"desintoxicação\\" pode estar ligada a lidar com emoções ou situações subjacentes. Lembre-se de que é normal ter músicas que agradam tanto que você quer ouvi-las repetidamente. No entanto, se isso se tornar problemático e você sentir que está atrapalhando seu dia a dia, utilizar essas dicas pode ser útil."},{"prompt":"não é isso, é que eu adorava uma música e agora não gosto dela tanto como antes","completion":"Ah, entendi! Muitas vezes, repetir demais uma música pode levar à \\"fadiga de escuta\\", onde você naturalmente se cansa de ouvir a mesma faixa após repetições contínuas. Se você já não curte tanto uma música que antes adorava, aqui estão algumas dicas para talvez reacender o seu interesse ou aceitar essa mudança no seu gosto musical: 1. Faça uma pausa: Dar um tempo dessa música pode ajudar. Assim que você não a ouve por um tempo, pode ser que você volte a apreciá-la com ouvidos \\"frescos\\". 2. Varie seu repertório: Descubra outras músicas ou artistas similares à música de que você gostava. Isso pode ampliar seus gostos musicais e, quem sabe, com o tempo, você volte a gostar da música original mas com uma nova perspectiva. 3. Contextualize a música: Às vezes, escutar uma música em um contexto diferente (durante uma atividade diferenciada, com amigos, ou em um momento significativo) pode trazer de volta a apreciação que você tinha por ela. 4. Aprofunde-se no artista ou na letra: Pesquisar mais sobre o artista, o significado da letra ou a produção da música pode aumentar sua apreciação por ela, oferecendo uma nova camada de entendimento e interesse. 5. Reinvente a experiência: Tente ouvir diferentes versões da música, como covers, remixes ou performances ao vivo, para variar a experiência sonora. 6. Aceite a mudança: Os gostos musicais mudam com o tempo e a sobreexposição pode levar a uma perda de interesse. Aceite que pode ser normal não gostar mais tanto de uma música e que isso é parte de um processo dinâmico do seu gosto pessoal. 7. Escute com moderação: Quando encontrar uma nova música de que goste muito, tente equilibrar a frequência com que a ouve para evitar a exaustão. 8. Reflexão: Reflita sobre o que essa música significou para você e por que ela era tão especial. Às vezes, a música está ligada a uma fase da sua vida, e seu gosto pode ter mudado à medida que você mudou. Independentemente disso, é natural ter uma relação em constante mudança com a música. O que hoje pode não ser mais tão atraente pode, em outra fase da vida, voltar a ser significativo. Estar aberto a essa flutuação é uma maneira saudável de lidar com a constante evolução de seus gostos musicais."},{"prompt":"sadece muayene kısmını özetle Baş anatomi ve fizyolojisi: Kemikler Kemik doku, içindeki yumuşak dokuyu korur Toplam 22 kemik (8’i kraniyal, 14’ü yüz) Kraniyal iskeleti oluşturan kemikler; • Frontal (1) • Temporal (2) • Parietal (2) • Oksipital (1) • Sfenoid (2) Oksipital Parietal Frontal Sfenoid Temporal Baş anatomi ve fizyolojisi: Kemikler Yüz kemik iskeleti (14 kemik): Mandibula (1) Maksilla (2) Nazal kemik (2) İnferior nazal konka (2) Palatin (2) Lakrimal kemik (2) Zigomatik (2) Vomer (1) Baş anatomi ve fizyolojisi: Kaslar ve trigeminal sinir ▪ Orbikularis oris (ağzın ana kası, ağzı çevreler) ▪ Orbikularis okuli (gözü çevreler) ▪ Platisma (boyunda, ince ve yüzeyel bir kas) ▪ Masseter, pterigoid, temporal kaslar (çiğneme kasları) ▪ Trigeminal veya 5. kraniyal sinir (oral kavite ve dişlerden gelen uyarıları taşır, çiğneme kaslarının inerve eder) M. frontalis M. orbikülaris okuli M. zigomatikus minör M. zigomatikus majör M masseter M. orbikülaris oris M. risorius M. trapezeus M. sternohioid M. skaleni Üst dudak levator ve burun kası M. levator labi superior M. depresor anguli oris M. mentalis M. sternokloidomastoid M epikranius M M sternokloidomastoid splenius kapitus M trapezeus Baş anatomi ve fizyolojisi: tükrük bezleri Parotis Submandibular Sublingual Parotis Submandibular Sublingual Boyun anatomisi ▪ Servikal vertebra ▪ Ligamentler ▪ Sternokloidomastoid ve trapezeus kası ▪ Trakea (tiroid kıkırdak, krikoid kıkırdak, trakeal halka) ▪ Özofagus ▪ İnternal ve eksternal juguler ven ▪ Karotis arter (internal, eksternal) ▪ Hyoid kemik ▪ Tiroid bezi: Orta kısmında istmus ile bağlı iki lob Boyun anatomisi ▪ Sternokleidomastoid kas Solunum sırasında sternumu yukarı kaldırır (11. kraniyal sinir-aksesorius inerve eder) ▪ Karotid kılıfı Sternokloidomastoid kasının altında (karotid arter, internal juguler ven, vagus siniri) Boyun anatomisi Baş anatomisi Boyun anatomisi • Anterior (medial) üçgen (tiroid bezi, larinks, farinks, lenf nodları, submandibular tükrük bezi, yağ dokusu) • Posterior (lateral) üçgen (lenf nodları) Baş ve boyun lenf nodları Baş ve boyun muayenesi SUBJEKTİF VERİLER (Şimdiki öyküsü) Baş ve boyun ağrısı • Başlangıcı: Sabahın erken saati, gün içinde, gece, giderek artan ya da ani biçimde mi? • Süresi: Dakika, saat, gün ve haftalar, uyku ya da ilaçla geçme durumu; kendiliğinden geçme durumu; cluster (küme) ağrı; ağrısız geçen süreler ne kadar? • Yeri: Kafa içinde, tek baş yan tarafında, boyunda, sinüslerde, gözlerin arkasında mı? • Tipi: Sürekli basınç,……. • Şiddeti: Aynı ya da değişken (1-10 ağrı ölçeği); sabahları ya da geceleri artması, sadece uyanıkken ya da uyurken görülmesi?

SOME NOTABLE PEOPLE President Roosevelt — Lord Balfour — Mr. Asquith — Lord Haldane — George Meredith — Rudyard Kipling — James Barrie — Henry Irving — Bernard Shaw — R. L. S. — Grant Allen — James Payn — Henry Thompson — Royalty. When I have chanced during my life to come in contact with notable people, I have often made some short record at the time of what they said and how they impressed me. It is difficult, however, to use these notes for publication when you happen to have been a guest, and it can only be done, I think, by using one's judgment and never consciously harming one's host. If every one were altogether silent upon such occasions the most pleasing side of great contemporaries would never be chronicled, for the statesman in slippers is a very much more human and lovable person than the politician on the platform. Among the great men that I have known President Roosevelt occupied a prominent place. He was not a big, nor, so far as one could see, a powerful man, but he had tremendous dynamic force and an iron will which may account for his reputation as an athlete. He had all the simplicity of real greatness, speaking his mind with great frankness and in the clearest possible English. He had in him a great deal of the boy, a mischievous, adventurous, high-spirited boy, with a deep, strong, thoughtful manhood in the background. We were present, my wife and I, at the Guildhall when he made his memorable speech about Egypt, in which he informed a gathering, which contained the Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, and many of our Cabinet, that we should either rule more strictly or clear out altogether. It was, of course, a most unwarrantable intrusion into our affairs, but it was a calculated indiscretion, and very welcome, I believe, to those who were dealing with Egypt. As he made his way through the dense crowd afterwards he passed me and said with a grin: \\"I say, I let them have it that time, didn't I?\\" There was the mischievous boy coming out. He had a quick blunt wit which showed itself often in his metaphors. He spoke to me, I remember, of some one who had a nine guinea-pig-power brain. One of his entourage told me how the President had been awakened once to address some prairie folk at a wayside station. \\"They have come sixty miles to see you,\\" said his secretary. \\"They would have come a hundred to see a cat with two heads,\\" said the ruffled President. I met him once at a small luncheon party at the invitation of Lord Lee, who had soldiered with him in Cuba. He was extremely talkative in fact, I can hardly remember anyone else saying anything. Thinking it over afterwards I concluded that two ideas were running through his mind, and every now and then coming to the surface. They were formidable ideas, and may have been some temporary wave of feeling, but they were certainly in his thoughts. The one was that there would be another civil war in the States. The second, that if you had the farmer class on your side they presented the best military material. From this I gathered that it was not a geographical but an economic struggle that was in his mind. Absit omen, but great men are often pessimists, and the Duke of Wellington was deeply convinced that Britain could not long survive his death. When Roosevelt was shot I sent him a cable to express that sympathy which every Englishman felt. I have his answer before me, written only a day or so after the event: MERCY HOSPITAL, CHICAGO, October 19, 1912. DEAR MR. DOYLE,— Many thanks for your kind message of sympathy. As you know, a bullet wound is rather a serious thing, but all conditions seem to be favourable, and I hope in a few days we will all be relieved from anxiety. Sincerely yours, THEODORE ROOSEVELT. It is typewritten, but signed by his own hand. I do not think that a more brave and detached letter was ever written by a sufferer. Roosevelt was a very loud hearty man, with a peculiar wild-beast toothy grin, and an explosive habit of slapping his hand down for emphasis. I jotted down a few of his obiter dicta after our conversation. He had no good word for Henry James. \\"He is not a whole man. All that subtlety is really decadence.\\" He was very virile, not to say heroic in his views. \\"A man should guard particularly against being led from his duty, especially a dangerous duty, by his women. I guess a woman would have had a bad time if she had tried to lead Leonidas from the pass.\\" Of the German Emperor he said that he was jealous of the King's dog at the King's funeral because he attracted the more notice. Altogether he was one of the raciest talkers I have ever met. Among the occasional great ones of earth whom I have met there is hardly anyone who stands out more clearly than Arthur Balfour, with his willowy figure, his gentle intellectual face, and, as I read it, his soul of steel. I should think that of all men of our day he was the last who would be turned from any path which he had deliberately taken, but, on the other hand, he was capable of standing a most unconscionable time at the place where paths divide, for his mind was so subtle and active that he would always see the two sides of every question and waver between them. He could never have been a pioneer. The occasion of our first meeting was a most ridiculous one. Old Lord Burnham, the first of his line, had invited me down to his country house at Beaconsfield—a wonderful house which had been built originally by Waller, the Royalist poet. Burke had lived close by, and the dagger which, in a melodramatic moment, he threw upon the floor of the house, in order to show the dangers of French Republican propaganda, is still on exhibition. I can remember the party well, though nearly all of them are now on the farther side. I see Lady Dorothy Nevill with her mittened hands and her prim pussy-cat manner, retailing gossip about Disraeli's flirtations. Sir Henry James walks under the trees with bended head, talking to the rising barrister who is destined as Lord Reading to be Viceroy of India. Lady Cleveland, mother of Lord Rosebery, is listening with her old face wreathed in smiles to Lady Dorothy's scandal. Young Harry Irving looks unutterably bored as Lord Burnham explains golf to him, bending his head over to get a glimpse of the ball round the curve of his goodly waistcoat. Mr. Asquith stands smiling beside them. As one looks back they seem all to have been shadows in a world of shadow. Lord Burnham's hobby was Turkish baths, and he had an excellent one in the front of the house, the drying room being the first door on the right as one entered, and being a simple sitting-room as far as appearance went. With his usual kind hospitality Lord Burnham had urged me to try his bath, and having done so I was placed, arrayed in a long towel, and with another towel screwed round my head, in the drying room. Presently the door opened, and entered Arthur Balfour, Prime Minister of England. He knew nothing of the house or its ways, and I can remember the amazement with which he gazed at me. Lord Burnham following at his heels introduced me, and I raised the towel on my head. There were no explanations, and I felt that he went away with the impression that this was my usual costume. I did not see him after that week-end — he kept his room, I remember, until midday on the Sunday — until some years later when, after heavy domestic loss, I was endeavouring to collect myself again in a little inn near Dunbar. He heard of my presence, and in his kindness sent a car over from Whittingehame, only a few miles away, with a request that I should come over for a couple of days. There was present his brother, Gerald Balfour, a man with a beautifully refined face and manner, not unlike that of Andrew Lang. His wife is the famous Lady Betty Balfour, the daughter of Lord Lytton. When one thinks of that group of inter-allied families—the Balfours, Cecils, Sedgwicks, and Lyttons—it seems a sort of nerve ganglion of British life. There was also Lady Frances Balfour, who was a daughter of the Duke of Argyle, and not unlike him, as I can remember him. Her husband was Arthur Balfour's brother, an architect and antiquary, while another brother was Colonel of the London Scottish. Finally, there was Miss Alice Balfour, a very sweet and gently intellectual person, who was my actual hostess. I found Arthur Balfour in great spirits because he had just won a golf medal at North Berwick. He seemed as pleased as any schoolboy, and his sister told me that no political success ever gave him the keen pleasure which he had from his golf victory. He was an average player, orthodox in style, and about 10 or 12 in handicap. He proved to be a charming host, for he was a good listener, seeming to be really eager to hear your opinion, laughed heartily at small provocation, and talked always very frankly and modestly of himself. After my long solitude I was more loquacious, I remember, than is my way, but he bore it with good humour. Every night — or at least on the Sunday night—the whole staff of the large rambling establishment, maids and grooms, some twenty in all, came in for prayers, which were read by the head of the house. It was fine to hear groom and statesman praying humbly together that they be forgiven the sins of the day, and merging all earthly distinctions in the presence of that which is above us all. He was very interesting when he spoke of the outrage which the Russian fleet had committed when, on their way to Japan, they opened fire at the British trawlers on the Dogger Bank. It was curious to hear his gentle voice and to note his listless impersonal manner while he spoke in this fashion: \\"I was very angry, really very angry about that affair. If our fleet had been at home I should have been inclined to have stopped them in the Straits. Of course, one would not do that unless one had overpowering force, so as to avoid bloodshed and save the Russian face. Their Ambassador called that morning and gave complete assurances, or really I should have had to do something. He got himself into trouble with his own Government, who felt that he had given away their case.\\" I asked him how Cabinet Councils were worked. He said that they voted upon points and went by majorities, unless it was a vital thing, when of course the dissenters must resign. I observed in his character a very great horror of cowardice. Nothing seemed to arouse such scorn in him. He grew quite red, I remember, as he spoke of Lord George Sackville, and recalled that though he had been broken and should have been shot at the Battle of Minden in 1759, he was none the less Minister of War during the American campaign. He was also, as I reminded him, a most debauched man; and the murder of his mistress, Miss Reay, the actress, by her true lover, the clergyman Hackman, was one of the causes célèbres of that century. I shall always carry away the memory of that visit—a bright gleam in a dark passage of life. I see very clearly the old house, the huge broken tree outside, inside which a State conspiracy was once hatched, the fine library with its wealth of French memoirs, and above all the remarkable man who stood for so much in the life of the country. I was not at that time so convinced of the primary importance of psychic things as I became later, and I regret it, as this would have been my one opportunity to explore a knowledge which at that time was certainly greater than my own. Years later, when the fight was heavy upon me, and when I was almost alone in the polemical arena, I wrote to Mr. Balfour, and charged him with sharing all my convictions and yet leaving me to defend them single-handed. His answer was: \\"Surely my opinions upon this subject are already sufficiently well known,\\" which is surely an admission that I was right in my description of them, and yet was not much of a prop to me in my time of need. I cast my mind back to other statesmen whom I have known, and Mr. Asquith's kindly personality comes into my memory. I remember playing a round of golf with him once—and a very bad player he was—but his conversation as we went round was plus four. He was a naturally sweet-natured man, but under that gentleness there lay judgment and firmness, as was shown at the great crisis of history. He never said too much, but what he did say he lived up to. In conducting us safely through those first two years of war he did that for which he has never had sufficient credit, and the more light we have had since, the more clear it has been that Lord Kitchener and he were really doing all that men could do, in munition work and all other ways. Because he had the solid Yorkshire stolidity, more nervous and excitable people thought that he did not take the war sufficiently seriously, while the constant lies about the pro-German tendencies of his wife increased the evil impression. We owe him a reparation which is second only to that which is due to Lord Haldane. And that is indeed a heavy one. If one man could be named who was absolutely indispensable to victory it was Haldane. He it was who built up the whole splendid weapon which flashed so swiftly from its sheath, and which Germany was so amazed to find directed at its breast as it rushed forward upon its furious course. He could not work miracles; he could not introduce conscription when a candidate with such a programme would have been chased from the hustings; he could not prepare the public mind in some dramatic way which would have precipitated the very crash which there was still some chance of avoiding. But all we had he gave us—the eight divisions which saved France, the Territorials who carried on the good work until the new armies were ready, and the Officers' Training Corps, which strengthened us where we should have been fatally weak. There has never been so foolish and ungrateful a clamour as that which has been raised against Haldane. I remember that when he took the chair for me in the first war lecture which I gave in London there were cries of \\"Traitor!\\" from people, chiefly women, among the audience. I had never seen Haldane before, and have never seen him since, so I have no personal bias in the matter, but I am proud that it was in my first volume of the \\"History of the War,\\" published in 1915, that I first put forward the unpopular view which will now be more fully accepted. With George Meredith I had several interesting connections. I have the greatest possible admiration for him at his best, while his worst is such a handicap that I think it will drag four-fifths of his work to oblivion. If his own generation finds him hard to understand, what will our descendants make of him? He will be a cult among a few—a precious few in every sense. And yet I fully recognize that his was the most active original brain and the most clever pen of any man, novelist or otherwise, of my time. Knowing this well, it is strange that I can see so limited a future for him. His subtle and intricate mind seemed unable to realize the position of the plain outsiders who represent the world. He could not see how his stained-glass might be less effective than the plain transparent substance as a medium for vision. The first requisite is to be intelligible. The second is to be interesting. The third is to be clever. Meredith enormously filled the third, but he was unequal upon the other two. Hence he will never, in spite of the glories of \\"Richard Feverel\\" be on an equality with Dickens or Thackeray, who filled all three. He had simply no idea how his words would strike a less complex mind. I remember that once in the presence of Barrie, Quiller-Couch and myself, he read out a poem which he had inscribed \\"To the British Working-Man\\" in the \\"Westminster Gazette.\\" I don't know what the British working-man made of it, but I am sure that we three were greatly puzzled as to what it was about. I had written some articles on his work, which had been one of my youthful cults, and that led to his inviting me to see him at his villa at Box Hill—the first of several such visits. There had been a good deal in the papers about his health, so that I was surprised when, as I opened the garden gate, a slight but robust gentleman in a grey suit and a red tie swung out of the hall door and came singing loudly down the path. I suppose he was getting on to seventy at the time but he looked younger, and his artistic face was good to the eye. Greeting me he pointed to a long steep hill behind the house and said: \\"I have just been up to the top for a walk.\\" I looked at the sharp slope and said: \\"You must be in good trim to do it.\\" He looked angry and said: \\"That would be a proper compliment to pay to an octogenarian.\\" I was a little nettled by his touchiness, so I answered: \\"I understood that I was talking to an invalid.\\" It really seemed as if my visit would terminate at the garden gate, but presently he relented, and we soon became quite friendly. He had in his youth been a judge of wine, and had still a reverence for a good vintage, but unfortunately some nervous complaint from which he suffered had caused the doctors to prohibit it absolutely. When lunch came round he asked me with a very earnest air whether I could undertake to drink a whole bottle of Burgundy. I answered that I saw no insuperable difficulty. A dusty old bottle was tenderly carried up, which I disposed of, Meredith taking a friendly interest in its dispatch. \\"The fact is,\\" said he, \\"I love my wine, and my little cellar was laid down with care and judgment, so that when some guest comes and drinks a glass and wastes the rest of the bottle it goes to my heart. It really did me good to see you enjoy that one.\\" I need not say that I intimated that I was always prepared to oblige. His conversation was extraordinarily vivid and dramatic, uttered in a most vehement tone. It may have been artificial, and it may have been acting, but it was very arresting and entertaining. The talk got upon Napoleon's Marshals, and you would have thought that he knew them intimately, and he did Murat's indignation at being told to charge au bout, as if he ever charged any other way, in a fashion which would have brought down the house. Every now and then he brought out a Meredithian sentence which sounded comic when applied to domestic matters. When the jelly swayed about as the maid put it on the table he said: \\"The jelly, Mary, is as treacherous as the Trojan Horse.\\" He laughed when I told him how my groom, enlisted as a waiter for some special dinner, said, \\"Huddup, there,\\" to the jelly under similar circumstances. After lunch we walked up a steep path to the little chalet or summerhouse where he used to write. He wished to read me a novel which he had begun twenty years before, but which he had not had the heart to go on with. I liked it greatly—and we roared with laughter at his description of an old sea-dog who turned up the collar of his coat when he went into action as if the bullets were rain. He said that my hearty enjoyment encouraged him to go on with it, and it has since appeared as the \\"Amazing Marriage,\\" but whether I really had anything to do with it I do not know. I should be proud to think so. The nervous complaint from which he suffered caused him to fall down occasionally. As we walked up the narrow path to the chalet I heard him fall behind me, but judged from the sound that it was a mere slither and could not have hurt him. Therefore I walked on as if I had heard nothing. He was a fiercely proud old man, and my instincts told me that his humiliation in being helped up would be far greater than any relief I could give him. It was certainly a nice point to decide. George Meredith's religious convictions were very difficult to decide. He certainly had no glimmering so far as I could see of any psychic element in life, and I should imagine that on the whole he shared the opinions of his friend, John Morley, which were completely negative. And yet I remember his assuring me that prayer was a very necessary thing, and that one should never abandon prayer. \\"Who rises from prayer a better man, his prayer is granted,\\" says the Aphorist in \\"Richard Feverel.\\" How far these positions can be harmonized I do not know. I suppose that one may say that God is unknown, and yet rear a mental temple to the unknown God. Rudyard Kipling I know far less than I should, considering how deeply I admire his writings, and that we live in the same county; but we are both absorbed in work, and both much away from home, which may explain it. I can well remember how eagerly I bought his first book, \\"Plain Tales,\\" in the old Southsea days, when buying a book was a rare strain upon my exchequer. I read it with delight, and realized not only that a new force had arisen in literature, but that a new method of story writing had appeared which was very different from my own adherence to the careful plot artfully developed. This was go-as-you-please take-it-or-leave-it work, which glowed suddenly up into an incandescent phrase or paragraph, which was the more effective for its sudden advent. In form his stories were crude, and yet in effect—which, after all, is everything—they were superb. It showed me that methods could not be stereotyped, and that there was a more excellent way, even if it were beyond my reach. I loved the \\"Barrack Room Ballads\\" also, and such poems as \\"The Bolivar,\\" \\"East and West,\\" and above all the badly named \\"Envoi\\" became part of my very self. I always read the last one aloud to my little circle before we start on any fresh expedition, because it contains the very essence of travel, romance, and high adventure. I saw Kipling most nearly in his very early days when he lived at Brattleboro', a little village in Vermont, in a chivalrous desire to keep his newly married wife in touch with her own circle. In 1894, as I have recorded, there was a good deal of tail-twisting going on in the States, and Kipling pulled a few feathers out of the Eagle's tail in retaliation, which caused many screams of protest, for the American was far more sensitive to such things than the case-hardened Briton. I say \\"was,\\" for I think as a nation with an increased assurance of their own worth and strength they are now more careless of criticism. The result at the time was to add oil to flames, and I, as a passionate believer in Anglo-American union, wrote to Kipling to remonstrate. He received my protest very good-humouredly, and it led to my visit to his country home. As a matter of fact, the concern shown in America, when the poet lay at death's door a few years later, showed that the rancour was not very deep. Perhaps he was better known at that time in America than in England, for I remember sitting beside a busman in London, who bowed his red face to my ear and said: \\"Beg your pardon, sir, but 'oo is this 'ere Kilpin?\\" I had two great days in Vermont, and have a grateful remembrance of Mrs. Kipling's hospitality. The poet read me \\"McAndrew's Hymn,\\" which he had just done, and surprised me by his dramatic power which enabled him to sustain the Glasgow accent throughout, so that the angular Scottish greaser simply walked the room. I had brought up my golf clubs and gave him lessons in a field while the New England rustics watched us from afar, wondering what on earth we were at, for golf was unknown in America at that time. We parted good friends, and the visit was an oasis in my rather dreary pilgrimage as a lecturer. My glimpses of Kipling since then have been few and scattered, but I had the pleasure several times of meeting his old father, a most delightful and lovable person, who told a story quite as well as his famous son. As the mother was also a very remarkable woman, it is no wonder that he carried such a cargo. James Barrie is one of my oldest literary friends, and I knew him within a year or two of the time when we both came to London. He had just written his \\"Window in Thrums,\\" and I, like all the world, acclaimed it. When I was lecturing in Scotland in 1893 he invited me to Kirriemuir, when I stayed some days with his family—splendid types of the folk who have made Scotland great. His father was a fine fellow, but his mother was wonderful with a head and a heart—rare combinations—which made me class her with my own mother. Kirriemuir could by no means understand Barrie's success, and looked upon their great son as an inexplicable phenomenon. They were acutely aware, however, that tourists were arriving from all parts to see the place on account of Barrie's books. \\"I suppose you have read them,\\" I said to the wife of the local hotel man. \\"Aye, I've read them, and steep, steep, weary work it was,\\" said she. She had some theory that it was a four-horse coach which her good man was running, and not the books at all which accounted for the boom. Great as are Barrie's plays — and some of them I think are very great — I wish he had never written a line for the theatre. The glamour of it and the—to him—easy success have diverted from literature the man with the purest style of his age. Plays are always ephemeral, however good, and are limited to a few, but Barrie's unborn books might have been an eternal and a universal asset of British literature. He has the chaste clarity which is the great style, which has been debased by a generation of wretched critics who have always confused what is clear with what is shallow, and what is turbid with what is profound. If a man's thought is precise, his rendering of it is precise, and muddy thoughts make obscure paragraphs. If I had to make my choice among modern stylists, I should pick Barrie for the lighter forms of expression and our British Winston Churchill for the more classical. Barrie's great play — one of the finest in the language — is of course \\"The Admirable Crichton.\\" I shall always hope that I had a hand in the fashioning of it. I say this not in complaint but in satisfaction, for we all drop seeds into each other, and seldom know whence they come. We were walking together on the Heath at Kirriemuir when I said: \\"I had a quaint thought in the night, Barrie. It was that a king was visiting India and was wrecked on the way on some island far from the track of ships. Only he and one rather handy sailor were saved. They settled down to spend their lives together. Of course the result would be that the sailor would become the king and the king the subject.\\" We chuckled over the idea, and when Crichton appeared, I seemed to see the fine plant which had grown from the tiny seed. Barrie and I had one unfortunate venture together, in which I may say that the misfortune was chiefly mine, since I had really nothing to do with the matter, and yet shared all the trouble. However, I should have shared the honour and profit in case of success, so that I have no right to grumble. The facts were that Barrie had promised Mr. D'Oyley Carte that he would provide the libretto of a light opera for the Savoy. This was in the Gilbert days, when such a libretto was judged by a very high standard. It was an extraordinary commission for him to accept, and I have never yet been able to understand why he did so, unless, like Alexander, he wanted fresh worlds to conquer. On this occasion, however, he met with a disastrous repulse, and the opera, \\"Jane Annie,\\" to which I alluded in an early chapter, was one of the few failures in his brilliant career. I was brought into the matter because Barrie's health failed on account of some family bereavement. I had an urgent telegram from him at Aldburgh, and going there I found him very worried because he had bound himself by this contract, and he felt in his present state unable to go forward with it. There were to be two acts, and he had written the first one, and had the rough scenario of the second, with the complete sequence of events—if one may call it a sequence. Would I come in with him and help him to complete it as part author? Of course I was very happy to serve him in any way. My heart sank, however, when, after giving the promise, I examined the work. The only literary gift which Barrie has not got is the sense of poetic rhythm, and the instinct for what is permissible in verse. Ideas and wit were there in abundance. But the plot itself was not strong, though the dialogue and the situations also were occasionally excellent. I did my best and wrote the lyrics for the second act, and much of the dialogue, but it had to take the predestined shape. The result was not good. However, the actual comradeship of production was very amusing and interesting, and our failure was mainly painful to us because it let down the producer and the cast. We were well abused by the critics, but Barrie took it all in the bravest spirit. I find, in looking over my papers, a belated statement of account from Barrie which is good reading. IN ACCOUNT WITH J. M. BARRIE Why. Cause of delay. Remarks. A £1 Lent at Station. Object moving too fast. Doyle says he lent it. B £12 Jane Annie on Tour. Moving or swaying of Kodak. Better late than never. C £30 6s. 4d, Heaven knows. Failure to pull cord. Doyle gets 2/5 of a penny beyond his share. Our association was never so closely renewed, but through all my changing life I have had a respect and affection for Barrie which were, I hope, mutual. How I collaborated with him at cricket as well as at work is told in my chapter on Sport. Henry Irving is one of the other great men whom I have met at close quarters, for his acting of Gregory Brewster brought us in contact. When he was producing \\"Coriolanus\\" he came down to Hindhead and used to drop in of an evening. He was fond of a glass of port—indeed, he was one of the four great men who were stated (probably untruly) by the Hon. G. Russell to drink a bottle each night—being the only trait which these great men had in common. The others, I remember, were Tennyson, Gladstone and Moses Montefiori, and the last I believe was really true. Like all bad habits, it overtook the sinner at last, and he was cut off at the age of 116. Irving had a curious dry wit which was occasionally sardonic and ill-natured. I can well believe that his rehearsals were often the occasion for heart-burnings among the men and tears among the ladies. The unexpectedness of his remarks took one aback. I remember when my friend Hamilton sat up with me into the \\"wee sma' hours\\" with the famous man, he became rather didactic on the subject of the Deity or the Universe or some other tremendous topic, which he treated very solemnly, and at great length. Irving sat with his intense eyes riveted upon the speaker's face, which encouraged Hamilton to go on and on. When at last he had finished, Irving remarked: \\"What a low comedian you would have made!\\" He wound up his visit by giving me his copy of \\"Coriolanus\\" with all his notes and stage directions—a very precious relic. Many visions of old times rise before my eyes as I write, but my book would lose all proportion should I dwell upon them. I see Henley, the formidable cripple, a red-bearded, loud-voiced buccaneer of a man who could only crawl, for his back appeared to be broken. He was a great poet and critic who seemed to belong to the roaring days of Marlowe of the mighty line and the pothouse fray. I see Haggard too, first as the young spruce diplomatist, later as the worn and bearded man with strange vague tendencies to mysticism. Shaw, too, I see with the pleasant silky voice and the biting phrase. It was strange that all the mild vegetables which formed his diet made him more pugnacious and, I must add, more uncharitable than the carnivorous man, so that I have known no literary man who was more ruthless to other people's feelings. And yet to meet him was always to like him. He could not resist a bitter jest or the perverted pleasure of taking up an unpopular attitude. As an example I remember Henry Irving telling me that when Shaw was invited to his father's funeral he wrote in reply: \\"If I were at Westminster Henry Irving would turn in his grave, just as Shakespeare would turn in his grave were Henry Irving at Stratford.\\" I may not have it verbally exact, but that was near enough. It was the kind of outrageous thing that he would say. And yet one can forgive him all when one reads the glorious dialogue of some of his plays. He seems subhuman in emotion and superhuman in intellect. Shaw was always a thorn in Irving's side, and was usually the one jarring note among the chorus of praise which greeted each fresh production. At a first night at the Lyceum—those wonderful first nights which have never been equalled—the lanky Irishman with his greenish face, his red beard, and his sardonic expression must have been like the death's-head at the banquet to Irving. Irving ascribed this animosity to Shaw's pique because his plays were not accepted, but in this I am sure that he did an injustice. It was simply that contrary twist in the man which makes him delight in opposing whatever anyone else approved. There is nothing constructive in him, and he is bound to be in perpetual opposition. No one for example was stronger for peace and for non-militarism than he, and I remember that when I took the chair at a meeting at Hindhead to back up the Tsar's peace proposals at The Hague, I thought to myself as I spied Shaw in a corner of the room: \\"Well, this time at any rate he must be in sympathy.\\" But far from being so he sprang to his feet and put forward a number of ingenious reasons why these proposals for peace would be disastrous. Do what you could he was always against you. Perhaps it is no bad thing to have the other point of view continually stated, and the British stand that sort of thing better than other nations. Had Shaw said in America what he said in England about the war whilst it was in progress he would have been in personal danger. There were times, however, when his queer contrary impulses became perfectly brutal in their working. One was at the time of the Titanic disaster, when he deliberately wrote a letter at a time when the wounds were raw, overwhelming every one concerned with bitter criticism. I was moved to write a remonstrance, and we had a sharp debate in public, which did not in any way modify our kindly personal relations. I can recall a smaller but even more unjustifiable example of his sour nature when he was staying at Hindhead. A garden-party had been got up for some charity, and it included the woodland scenes of \\"As You Like It,\\" which were done by amateurs, and very well done too. Shaw with no provocation wrote a whole column of abuse in the local paper, spattering all the actors and their performance with ridicule, and covering them with confusion, though indeed they had nothing to be ashamed of. One mentions these things as characteristic of one side of the man, and as a proof, I fear, that the adoption by the world of a vegetarian diet will not bring unkind thoughts or actions to an end. But with it all Shaw is a genial creature to meet, and I am pre-pared to believe that there is a human kindly side to his nature though it has not been presented to the public. It took a good man to write \\"Saint Joan.\\" Wells, too, I have known long, and indeed I must have often entered the draper's shop in which he was employed at Southsea, for the proprietor was a patient of mine. Wells is one of the great fruits which popular education has given us, since he came, as he is proud to state, from the heart of the people. His democratic frankness and complete absence of class feeling are occasionally embarrassing. I remember his asking me once if I had played cricket at Liphook. I said that I had. He said: \\"Did you notice an old fellow who acts as professional and ground-keeper?\\" I said that I had. \\"That was my father,\\" said Wells. I was too much surprised to answer, and could only congratulate myself that I had made no unpleasant comments before I knew the identity of the old man. I have always had my doubts as to those elaborate forecasts of the future in which Wells indulges. He has, it is true, made a couple of good shots which have already materialized in the tanks and in the machine which would deliver news in our own houses. But he has never shown any perception of the true meaning of the psychic, and for want of it his history of the world, elaborate and remarkable as it was, seemed to me to be a body without a soul. However, this also may be given him, and it will make his equipment complete. I remember discussing the matter with him, when George Gissing, Hornung, he and I foregathered in Rome early in this century, but apparently my words had no effect. Willie Hornung, my brother-in-law, is another of my vivid memories. He was a Dr. Johnson without the learning but with a finer wit. No one could say a neater thing, and his writings, good as they are, never adequately represented the powers of the man, nor the quickness of his brain. These things depend upon the time and the fashion, and go flat in the telling, but I remember how, when I showed him the record of some one who claimed to have done 100 yards under ten seconds, he said: \\"It is a sprinter's error.\\" Golf he could not abide, for he said it was \\"unsportsmanlike to hit a sitting ball.\\" His criticism upon my Sherlock Holmes was: \\"Though he might be more humble, there is no police like Holmes.\\" I think I may claim that his famous character Raffles was a kind of inversion of Sherlock Holmes, Bunny playing Watson. He admits as much in his kindly dedication. I think there are few finer examples of short-story writing in our language than these, though I confess I think they are rather dangerous in their suggestion. I told him so before he put pen to paper, and the result has, I fear, borne me out. You must not make the criminal a hero. Jerome, too, is an old friend. He is an adventurous soul, and at one time started a four-in-hand. I remember sitting on the top of it, and when one of the leaders turned right round and took a good look at the driver I thought it was time to get down. Maxwell also is an old friend. He is, of course, the son of Miss Braddon, who married a publisher of that name. I respect him for doing a man's work in the war when, though he was fifty years of age, and had led a sedentary life, he volunteered for a fighting battalion, a credit which he shares with A. E. W. Mason. Maxwell's work has always greatly appealed to me, and I have long looked upon him as the greatest novelist that we possess. I never met Robert Louis Stevenson in the flesh, though I owe so much to him in the literary spirit. Never can I forget the delight with which I read those early stories of his in the \\"Cornhill,\\" before I knew the name of the author. I still think that \\"The Pavilion on the Links\\" is one of the great short stories of the world, though there were alterations in the final form which were all for the worse, and showed prudery upon the part of the publishers. Stevenson's last year at Edinburgh University must have just about coincided with my first one, and Barrie must also have been in that grey old nest of learning about the year 1876. Strange to think that I probably brushed elbows with both of them in the crowded portal. From his far-away home in Samoa he seemed to keep a quick eye upon literary matters in England, and I had most encouraging letters from him in 1893 and 1894. \\"O frolic fellow-spookist\\" was his curious term of personal salutation in one of these, which showed that he shared my interest in psychic research but did not take it very seriously. I cannot guess how at that time he had detected it, though I was aware that he had himself in early days acted as secretary to a psychic research or rather to a spiritualist society in Edinburgh, which studied the remarkable mediumship of Duguid. His letters to me consisted of kind appreciation of my work. \\"I have a great talent for compliment,\\" he said, \\"accompanied by a hateful, even a diabolic, frankness.\\" He had been retailing some of my Sherlock Holmes yarns to his native servants—I should not have thought that he needed to draw upon anyone else—and he complained to me in a comical letter of the difficulty of telling a story when you had to halt every moment to explain what a railway was, what an engineer was, and so forth. He got the story across in spite of all difficulties, and, said he, \\"If you could have seen the bright feverish eyes of Simite you would have tasted glory.\\" But he explained that the natives took everything literally, and that there was no such thing as an imaginary story for them. \\"I, who write this, have had the indiscretion to perpetaate a trifling piece of fiction, 'The Bottle Imp. Parties who come up to visit my mansion, after having admired the ceiling by Vanderputty and the tapestry by Gobbling, manifest towards the end a certain uneasiness which proves them to be fellows of an infinite delicacy. They may be seen to shrug a brown shoulder, to roll up a speaking eye, and at last the secret bursts from them: 'Where is the bottle?' \\"In another letter he said that as I had written of my first book in the \\"Idler\\" he also would do so. \\"I could not hold back where the white plume of Conan Doyle waved in front of me.\\" So, at least, I may boast that it is to me that the world owes the little personal sketch about \\"Treasure Island\\" which appeared in that year. I cannot forget the shock that it was to me when driving down the Strand in a hansom cab in 1896 I saw upon a yellow evening poster \\"Death of Stevenson.\\" Some-thing seemed to have passed out of my world. I was asked by his executors to finish the novel \\"St. Ives,\\" which he had left three-quarters completed, but I did not feel equal to the task. It was done, however, and, I understand, very well done, by Quiller-Couch. It is a desperately difficult thing to carry on another man's story, and must be a more or less mechanical effort. I had one experience of it when my neighbour at Hindhead, Grant Allen, was on his death-bed. He was much worried because there were two numbers of his serial, \\"Hilda Wade,\\" which was running in \\"The Strand\\" magazine, still uncompleted. It was a pleasure for me to do them for him, and so relieve his mind, but it was difficult collar work, and I expect they were pretty bad. Some time afterwards a stranger, who evidently confused Allen and me, wrote to say that his wife had given him a baby girl, and that in honour of me he was calling her Hilda Wade. He was really nearer the truth than appeared at first sight. I well remember that death-bed of Grant Allen's. He was an agnostic of a type which came very near atheism, though in his private life an amiable and benevolent man. Believing what he did, the approach of death must have offered rather a bleak prospect, and as he had paroxysms of extreme pain the poor fellow seemed very miserable. I had often argued the case with him, I from a Theistic and he from a negative point of view, but I did not intrude my opinions or disturb his mind at that solemn moment. Death-bed changes, though some clergy may rejoice in them, are really vain things. His brain, however, was as clear as ever, and his mind was occupied with all manner of strange knowledge, which he imparted in the intervals of his pain, in the curious high nasal voice which was characteristic. I can see him now, his knees drawn up to ease internal pain, and his long thin nose and reddish-grey goatee protruding over the sheet, while he creaked out: \\"Byzantine art, my dear Doyle, was of three periods, the middle one roughly coinciding with the actual fall of the Roman Empire. The characteristics of the first period——\\" and so on, until he would give a cry, clasp his hands across his stomach, and wait till the pain passed before resuming his lecture. His dear little wife nursed him devotedly, and mitigated the gloom of those moments which can be made the very happiest in life if one understands what lies before one. One thinks, as a contrast, of Dr. Hodgson's impatient cry, \\"I can hardly wait for death!\\" Grant Allen's strong opinions in print, and a certain pleasure he took in defending outside positions, gave quite a false view of his character, which was gentle and benignant. I remember his coming to a fancy dress ball which we gave in the character of a Cardinal, and in that guise all the quiet dignity of the man seemed to come out and you realized how much our commonplace modern dress disguises the real man. He used to tell with great amusement how a couple, who afterwards became close friends, came first to call, and how as they waited on the doorstep the wife said to the husband: \\"Remember, John, if he openly blasphemes, I leave the room.\\" He had, I remember, very human relations with the maids who took a keen interest in their employer's scientific experiments. On one occasion these were connected with spiders, and the maid rushed into the drawing-room and cried: \\"Oh, sir, Araminta has got a wasp.\\" Araminta was the name given to the big spider which he was observing at the time. Grant Allen had no actual call to write fiction, but his brain was agile enough to make some sort of job of anything to which it turned. On the other hand, as a popular scientist he stood alone, or shared the honour with Samuel Laing. His only real success in fiction was the excellent short story John Creedy, where he combined science with fiction, with remarkable results. At the time when I and so many others turned to letters there was certainly a wonderful vacancy for the new-comer. The giants of old had all departed. Thackeray, Dickens, Charles Reade and Trollope were memories. There was no great figure remaining save Hardy rising. The novelist was Mrs. Humphrey Ward, who was just beginning her career with \\"Robert Elsmere,\\" the first of that series of novels which will illuminate the later Victorian era more clearly than any historian ever can do. I think it was Hodgkin who said, when he read \\"Count Robert of Paris \\": \\"Here have I been studying Byzantium all my life, and I never understood it until this blessed Scotch lawyer came along.\\" That is the special prerogative of imagination. Trollope and Mrs. Ward have the whole Victorian civilization dissected and preserved. Then there were Meredith, unintelligible to most, and Walter Besant. There was Wilkie Collins, too, with his fine stories of mystery, and finally there was James Payn. Payn was much greater than his books. The latter were usually rather mechanical, but to get at the real man one has to read such articles as his \\"Literary Reminiscences,\\" and especially his \\"Backwater of Life.\\" He had all that humorous view which Nature seems to give as a compensation to those whose strength is weak. Had Payn written only essays he would have rivalled Charles Lamb. I knew him best in his latter days, when he was crippled with illness, and his poor fingers so twisted with rheumatic arthritis that they seemed hardly human. He was intensely pessimistic as to his own fate. \\"Don't make any mistake, Doyle, death is a horrible thing—horrible! I suffer the agonies of the damned!\\" But five minutes later he would have his audience roaring with laughter, and his own high treble laugh would be the loudest of all. His own ailments were frequently a source of mirth. I remember how he described the breaking of a blood-vessel in Bournemouth and how they carried him home on a litter. He was dimly conscious of the fir-woods through which he passed. \\"I thought it was my funeral, and that they had done me well in the matter of plumes.\\" When he told a story he was so carried away by his sense of humour that he could hardly get the end out, and he finished up in a kind of scream. An American had called upon him at some late hour and had discoursed upon Assyrian tablets. \\"I thought they were something to eat,\\" he screamed. He was an excellent whist player, and the Baldwin Club used to send three members to his house on certain days so that the old fellow should not go without his game. This game was very scientific. He would tell with delight how he asked some novice: \\"Do you play the penultimate?\\" To which the novice answered: \\"No—but my brother plays the American organ.\\" Many of my generation of authors had reason to love him, for he was a human and kindly critic. His writing however, was really dreadful. It was of him that the story was told than an author handed one of his letters to a chemist for a test. The chemist retired for a time and then returned with a bottle and demanded half a crown. Better luck attended the man who received an illegible letter from a railway director. He used it as a free pass upon the line. Payn used to joke about his own writing, but it was a very real trouble when one could not make out whether he had accepted or rejected one's story. There was one letter in which I could only read the words \\"infringement of copyright.\\" He was very funny when he described the work of the robust younger school. \\"I have received a story from——\\" he said, \\"5,000 words, mostly damns.\\" I knew Sir Henry Thompson, the famous surgeon, very well, and was frequently honoured by an invitation to his famous octave dinners, at which eight carefully chosen male guests were always the company. They always seemed to me to be the most wonderful exhibitions of unselfishness, for Thompson was not allowed any alcohol, or anything save the most simple viands. Possibly, however, like Meredith and the bottle of burgundy, he enjoyed some reflex pleasure from-the enjoyment of others. He had been a wonderful viveur and judge of what was what, and I fear that I disappointed him, for I was much more interested in the conversation than the food, and it used to annoy me when some argument was interrupted in order to tell us that it was not ordinary ham but a Westphalian wild boar that we were eating and that it had been boiled in wine for precisely the right time prescribed by the best authorities. But it was part of his wonderful unselfish hospitality to make his guests realize exactly what it was that was set before them. I have never heard more interesting talk than at these male gatherings, for it is notorious that though ladies greatly improve the appearance of a feast they usually detract from the quality of the talk. Few men are ever absolutely natural when there are women in the room. There was one special dinner, I fancy it was the hundredth of the series, which was particularly interest-ing as the Prince of Wales, now George V, was one of the eight, and gave us a most interesting account of the voyage round the world from which he had just returned. Of the rest of the company I can only recall Sir Henry Stanley, the traveller, and Sir Crichton Browne. Twenty years later I met the King when he visited a trade exhibition, and I attended as one of the directors of Tuck's famous postcard firm. He at once said: \\"Why, I have not seen you since that pleasant dinner when you sat next to me at Sir Henry Thompson's.\\" It seemed to me to be a remarkable example of the royal gift of memory. I have not often occupied a chair among the seats of the mighty. My life has been too busy and too preoccupied to allow me to stray far from my beaten path. The mention of the Prince, however, reminds me of the one occasion when I was privileged to entertain—or to attempt to entertain—the present Queen. It was at a small dinner to which I was invited by the courtesy of Lord Midleton whose charming wife, once Madeleine Stanley daughter of Lady Helier, I could remember since her girlhood. Upon this occasion the Prince and Princess came in after dinner, the latter sitting alone at one end of the room with a second chair beside her own, which was occupied successively by the various gentlemen who were to be introduced to her. I was led up in due course, made my bow, and sat down at her request. I confess that I found it heavy going at first, for I had heard somewhere that Royalty has to make the first remark, and had it been the other way there was such a gulf between us that I should not have known where to begin. However she was very pleasant and gracious and began asking me some questions about my works which brought me on to very easy ground. Indeed, I became so interested in our talk that I was quite disappointed when Mr. John Morley was led up, and I realized that it was time for me to vacate the chair. There was another amusing incident on that eventful evening. I had been asked to take in Lady Curzon, whose husband, then Viceroy of India, had been unable to attend. The first couple had passed in and there was a moment's hesitation as to who should go next, but Lady Curzon and I were nearest the door, so possibly with some little encouragement from the lady we filed through. I thought nothing of the incident but some great authority upon these matters came to me afterwards in great excitement. \\"Do you know,\\" he said, \\"that you have established a precedent and solved one of the most difficult and debatable matters of etiquette that has ever caused ill-feeling in British Society?\\" \\"The Lord Chancellor and the College of Heralds should be much obliged to you, for you have given them a definite lead. There has never been so vexed a question as to whether a Vice-reine when she is away from the country where she represents royalty shall take precedence over a Duchess. There was a Duchess in the room, but you by your decided action have settled the matter for ever.\\" So who shall say that I have done nothing in my life? Of the distinguished lights of the law whom I have met from time to time I think that Sir Henry Hawkins—then become Lord Bampton—made the most definite impression. I met him at a week-end gathering at Cliveden, when Mr. Astor was our host. On the first night at dinner, before the party had shaken down into mutual acquaintance, the ex-judge, very old and as bald as an ostrich egg, was seated opposite, and was wreathed with smiles as he made himself agreeable to his neighbour. His appearance was so jovial that I remarked to the lady upon my left: \\"It is curious to notice the appearance of our vis-â-vis and to contrast it with his reputation,\\" alluding to his sinister record as an inexorable judge. She seemed rather puzzled by my remark, so I added: \\"Of course you know who he is.\\" \\"Yes,\\" said she, \\"his name is Conan Doyle and he writes novels.\\" I was hardly middle-aged at the time and at my best physically, so that I was amused at her mistake, which arose from some confusion in the list of guests. I put my dinner card up against her wine-glass, so after that we got to know each other. Hawkins was a most extraordinary man, and so capricious that one never knew whether one was dealing with Jekyll or with Hyde. It was certainly Hyde when he took eleven hours summing up in the Penge case, and did all a man could do to have all four of the prisoners condemned to death. Sir Edward Clarke was so incensed at his behaviour on this occasion that he gave notice when Hawkins retired from the bench that if there were the usual complimentary ceremonies he would protest. So they were dropped. I might, on the other hand, illustrate the Jekyll side of him by a story which he told me with his own lips. A prisoner had a pet mouse. One day the brute of a warder deliberately trod upon it. The prisoner caught up his dinner knife and dashed at the warder, who only just escaped, the knife stabbing the door as it closed behind him. Hawkins as judge wanted to get the man off, but the attempt at murder was obvious and the law equally clear. What was he to do? In his charge to the jury he said: \\"If a man tries to kill another in a way which is on the face of it absurd, it becomes a foolish rather than a criminal act. If, for example, a man in London discharged a pistol to hurt a man in Edinburgh, we could only laugh at such an offence. So also when a man stabs an iron-plated door while another man is at the other side of it we cannot take it seriously.\\" The jury, who were probably only too glad to follow such a lead, brought in a verdict of \\"Not guilty.\\" Another distinguished man of the law who left a very clear impression upon my mind was Sir Francis Jeune, afterwards Lord St. Helier. I attended several of Lady Jeune's famous luncheon parties, which were quite one of the outstanding institutions of London, like Gladstone's breakfasts in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. I am indebted to this lady for very many kind actions. Her husband always impressed me with his gentle wisdom and with his cultivated taste. He told me that if every copy of Horace were destroyed he thought that he could reconstruct most of it from memory. He presided over the Divorce Courts, and I remember upon one occasion I said to him: \\"You must have a very low opinion of human nature, Sir Francis, since the worst side of it is for ever presented towards you.\\" \\"On the contrary,\\" said he very earnestly, \\"my experience in the Divorce Courts has greatly raised my opinion of humanity. There is so much chivalrous self-sacrifice, and so much disposition upon the part of every one to make the best of a bad business that it is extremely edifying.\\" This view seemed to me to be worth recording.","completion":"XXIII. ALGUNAS PERSONAS NOTABLES Presidente Roosevelt — Lord Balfour — Sr. Asquith — Lord Haldane — George Meredith — Rudyard Kipling — James Barrie — Henry Irving — Bernard Shaw — R. L. S. — Grant Allen — James Payn — Henry Thompson — Realeza. Cuando he tenido la oportunidad durante mi vida de entrar en contacto con personas notables, a menudo he hecho alguna breve anotación en ese momento sobre lo que dijeron y cómo me impresionaron. Sin embargo, es difícil utilizar estas notas para su publicación cuando has sido invitado, y solo se puede hacer, creo, utilizando el juicio de uno y nunca dañando conscientemente a tu anfitrión. Si todos guardaran silencio en tales ocasiones, el lado más agradable de los contemporáneos ilustres nunca sería registrado, pues el estadista en pantuflas es una persona mucho más humana y amable que el político en la plataforma. Entre los grandes hombres que he conocido, el presidente Roosevelt ocupó un lugar destacado. No era un hombre grande ni, por lo que uno podía ver, un hombre poderoso, pero tenía una tremenda fuerza dinámica y una voluntad de hierro que pueden explicar su reputación como atleta. Tenía toda la simplicidad de la verdadera grandeza, expresando su mente con gran franqueza y en el inglés más claro posible. Tenía mucho de niño en él, un niño travieso, aventurero y de espíritu elevado, con una profunda y fuerte virilidad en segundo plano. Mi esposa y yo estuvimos presentes en el Guildhall cuando dio su memorable discurso sobre Egipto, en el que informó a una asamblea, que contenía al Secretario de Relaciones Exteriores, Sir Edward Grey, y a muchos de nuestro Gabinete, que deberíamos gobernar más estrictamente o abandonar por completo. Por supuesto, fue una intromisión totalmente inaceptable en nuestros asuntos, pero fue una indiscreción calculada y muy bienvenida, creo, a los que estaban tratando con Egipto. Mientras se abría paso entre la densa multitud después, pasó junto a mí y dijo con una sonrisa: \\"Digo, les di fuerte esa vez, ¿no es así?\\" Ahí estaba saliendo el niño travieso. Tenía un ingenio agudo y directo que a menudo se manifestaba en sus metáforas. Me habló, recuerdo, de alguien que tenía un cerebro con la potencia de nueve cobayas. Uno de su séquito me contó cómo una vez despertaron al presidente para dirigirse a algunos habitantes de la pradera en una estación de camino. \\"Han venido sesenta millas para verte\\", dijo su secretario. \\"Habrían venido cien para ver a un gato con dos cabezas\\", dijo el molesto presidente. Lo conocí una vez en una pequeña comida organizada por Lord Lee, quien había luchado con él en Cuba. Era extremadamente hablador de hecho, apenas recuerdo que alguien más dijera algo. Pensándolo después, concluí que dos ideas le pasaban por la mente y de vez en cuando salían a la superficie. Eran ideas formidables y pueden haber sido solo una oleada temporal de sentimientos, pero ciertamente estaban en sus pensamientos. La primera era que habría otra guerra civil en los Estados. La segunda, que si tenías de tu lado a la clase de los campesinos, presentarían el mejor material militar. De esto deduje que no era una lucha geográfica sino económica lo que tenía en mente. Pero que así sea, los grandes hombres suelen ser pesimistas, y el Duque de Wellington estaba profundamente convencido de que Gran Bretaña no sobreviviría mucho tiempo después de su muerte. Cuando Roosevelt fue herido de bala, le envié un cable para expresarle la simpatía que todo inglés sentía. Tengo su respuesta ante mí, escrita solo un día o dos después del evento: HOSPITAL MERCY, CHICAGO, 19 de octubre de 1912. QUERIDO SEÑOR DOYLE, — Muchas gracias por su amable mensaje de simpatía. Como sabe, una herida de bala es algo bastante serio, pero todas las condiciones parecen ser favorables, y espero que en unos días todos estaremos aliviados de la ansiedad. Atentamente, THEODORE ROOSEVELT. Está mecanografiada, pero firmada por su propia mano. No creo que jamás se haya escrito una carta más valiente y desapegada por un sufriente. Roosevelt era un hombre muy fuerte y cordial, con una peculiar y salvaje sonrisa dentona, y un hábito explosivo de dar golpes con la mano en la mesa para enfatizar. Anoté algunas de sus dicta obiter después de nuestra conversación. No tenía una buena palabra para Henry James. \\"No es un hombre completo. Toda esa sutileza es realmente decadencia\\". Tenía opiniones muy viriles, por no decir heroicas. \\"Un hombre debe tener especial cuidado de no ser apartado de su deber, especialmente un deber peligroso, por sus mujeres. Supongo que una mujer lo habría pasado muy mal si hubiera intentado alejar a Leónidas del paso\\". Del emperador alemán dijo que estaba celoso del perro del Rey en el funeral del Rey porque atrajo más atención. En general, fue uno de los hablantes más jugosos que he conocido. Entre los grandes ocasionales de la tierra con los que me he encontrado, difícilmente hay alguien que destaque más claramente que Arthur Balfour, con su figura flexible, su rostro intelectual gentil y, como lo veo, su alma de acero. Creo que de todos los hombres de nuestro tiempo él fue el último que habría sido apartado de cualquier camino que hubiera tomado deliberadamente, pero, por otro lado, era capaz de estar un tiempo excesivamente prolongado en el lugar donde se dividen los caminos, porque su mente era tan sutil y activa que siempre vería los dos lados de cada cuestión y vacilaría entre ellos. Nunca podría haber sido un pionero. La ocasión de nuestro primer encuentro fue una muy ridícula. El viejo Lord Burnham, el primero de su línea, me había invitado a su casa de campo en Beaconsfield, una maravillosa casa que originalmente había sido construida por Waller, el poeta realista. Burke había vivido cerca, y la daga que, en un momento melodramático, arrojó al suelo de la casa, para mostrar los peligros de la propaganda republicana francesa, aún se exhibe. Recuerdo bien la fiesta, aunque casi todos ellos están ahora al otro lado. Veo a Lady Dorothy Nevill con sus manos enguantadas y su aire de gata primorosa, relatando chismes sobre las flirterías de Disraeli. Sir Henry James camina bajo los árboles con la cabeza gacha, hablando con el joven abogado destinado a ser Lord Reading, Virrey de la India. Lady Cleveland, madre de Lord Rosebery, escucha con su rostro anciano lleno de sonrisas los escándalos de Lady Dorothy. El joven Harry Irving parece aburrido hasta la muerte mientras Lord Burnham le explica el golf, doblando la cabeza para echar un vistazo a la pelota alrededor de la curva de su generoso chaleco. El Sr. Asquith está sonriendo a su lado. Mientras se mira hacia atrás, parece que todos ellos hubieran sido sombras en un mundo de sombra. El pasatiempo de Lord Burnham eran los baños turcos, y tenía uno excelente en la parte delantera de la casa, siendo la sala de secado la primera puerta a la derecha al entrar, y siendo una simple sala de estar como apariencia. Con su habitual amable hospitalidad, Lord Burnham me había instado a probar su baño, y habiéndolo hecho, me colocaron, vestido con una larga toalla y con otra toalla enrollada alrededor de mi cabeza, en la sala de secado. En ese momento se abrió la puerta y entró Arthur Balfour, Primer Ministro de Inglaterra. No sabía nada de la casa ni de sus costumbres, y puedo recordar la sorpresa con la que me miró. Lord Burnham, siguiendo sus pasos, me presentó, y levanté la toalla de mi cabeza. No hubo explicaciones, y sentí que se fue con la impresión de que ese era mi atuendo habitual. No lo volví a ver después de ese fin de semana —se quedó en su habitación, recuerdo, hasta el mediodía del domingo— hasta algunos años después, cuando, después de una gran pérdida familiar, estaba tratando de recogerme de nuevo en una pequeña posada cerca de Dunbar. Se enteró de mi presencia y, en su amabilidad, me envió un coche desde Whittingehame, a solo unas pocas millas de distancia, con una solicitud de que fuera a pasar un par de días. Estaban presentes su hermano, Gerald Balfour, un hombre con un rostro y una manera bellamente refinados, no muy diferente a la de Andrew Lang. Su esposa es la famosa Lady Betty Balfour, hija de Lord Lytton. Cuando uno piensa en ese grupo de familias inter-aliadas: los Balfours, Cecils, Sedgwicks y Lyttons, parece una especie de gánglio nervioso de la vida británica. También estaba Lady Frances Balfour, quien era hija del Duque de Argyle, y no muy diferente a él, como puedo recordarlo. Su marido era el hermano de Arthur Balfour, un arquitecto y anticuario, mientras que otro hermano era Coronel del London Scottish. Finalmente, estaba la señorita Alice Balfour, una persona muy dulce e intelectualmente gentil, quien era mi anfitriona de hecho. Encontré a Arthur Balfour de muy buen humor porque acababa de ganar una medalla de golf en North Berwick. Parecía tan complacido como cualquier colegial, y su hermana me dijo que ningún éxito político le había dado el gran placer que tenía de su victoria en el golf. Era un jugador promedio, ortodoxo en estilo, y con un hándicap de alrededor de 10 o 12. Resultó ser un encantador anfitrión, ya que era un buen oyente, parecía ansioso de escuchar tu opinión, se reía sinceramente ante cualquier provocación y siempre hablaba de sí mismo de manera muy franca y modesta. Después de mi larga soledad, recuerdo que fui más locuaz, de lo que es mi costumbre, pero lo soportó con buen humor. Todas las noches, o al menos en la noche del domingo, todo el personal del gran establecimiento errante, criadas y mozos, unos veinte en total, entraban para rezar, lo que era leído por el jefe de la casa. Fue grandioso escuchar al mozo y al estadista rezando juntos humildemente para que les perdonaran los pecados del día, y fusionar todas las distinciones terrenales en presencia de lo que está por encima de todos nosotros. Fue muy interesante cuando habló de la atrocidad que la flota rusa había cometido cuando, en su camino a Japón, abrió fuego contra los pesqueros británicos en Dogger Bank. Fue curioso escuchar su voz suave e inactiva y notar su manera impersonal mientras hablaba de esta manera: \\"Estaba muy enojado, realmente muy enojado por ese asunto. Si nuestra flota hubiera estado en casa, habría tendido a retenerlos en el Estrecho. Por supuesto, uno no haría eso a menos que tuviera una fuerza abrumadora, para evitar el derramamiento de sangre y salvar la cara rusa. Su embajador llamó esa mañana y dio garantías completas, o realmente habría tenido que hacer algo\\". Me dijo que se había metido en problemas con su propio Gobierno, que sentía que había cedido su caso. Le pregunté cómo se trabajaban los Consejos de Gabinete. Dijo que votaban sobre los puntos y seguían las mayorías, a menos que fuera algo vital, en cuyo caso, por supuesto, los disidentes debían renunciar. Observé en su carácter una gran aversión a la cobardía. Nada parecía despertar tanto desprecio en él. Se puso bastante rojo, recuerdo, mientras hablaba de Lord George Sackville, y recordó que aunque fue destruido y debería haber sido fusilado en la Batalla de Minden en 1759, fue, sin embargo, Ministro de Guerra durante la campaña americana. También era, como se lo recordé, un hombre muy depravado; y el asesinato de su amante, la actriz Miss Reay, por su verdadero amante, el clérigo Hackman, fue uno de los causas célebres de ese siglo. Siempre llevaré conmigo el recuerdo de esa visita — un destello brillante en un oscuro pasaje de la vida. Veo muy claramente la vieja casa, el enorme árbol partido afuera, dentro del cual se organizó una conspiración estatal, la fina biblioteca con su gran cantidad de memorias francesas y, sobre todo, el hombre notable que significó tanto en la vida del país. En ese momento no estaba tan convencido de la importancia primordial de las cosas psíquicas como lo hice más tarde, y lo lamento, ya que esta habría sido mi única oportunidad para explorar un conocimiento que en ese momento ciertamente era mayor que el mío. Años más tarde, cuando la pelea estaba pesada sobre mí y estaba casi solo en la arena polémica, escribí al Sr. Balfour y lo acusé de compartir todas mis convicciones y aún así dejarme defenderlas solo. Su respuesta fue: \\"Seguramente mis opiniones sobre este tema ya son suficientemente conocidas\\", que es seguramente una admisión de que tenía razón en mi descripción de ellas, y sin embargo no fue de mucha ayuda para mí en mi momento de necesidad. Me remonto a otros estadistas que he conocido, y la amable personalidad del Sr. Asquith viene a mi memoria. Recuerdo haber jugado una ronda de golf con él una vez, y era un jugador muy malo, pero su conversación mientras dábamos vueltas era más cuatro. Era un hombre naturalmente dulce, pero bajo esa dulzura yacían el juicio y la firmeza, como se mostró en la gran crisis de la historia. Nunca dijo demasiado, pero lo que decía lo cumplía. En llevarnos de manera segura a través de los primeros dos años de la guerra hizo lo que nunca se le ha dado suficiente crédito, y mientras más luz hemos tenido desde entonces, más claro ha sido que Lord Kitchener y él estaban haciendo todo lo que podían hacer, en el trabajo de municiones y en todos los demás sentidos. Porque tenía la sólida solidez de Yorkshire, la gente más nerviosa e inquieta pensaba que no tomaba la guerra lo suficientemente en serio, mientras que las mentiras constantes sobre las tendencias pro-alemanas de su esposa aumentaban la mala impresión. Le debemos una reparación que solo es superada por la que se debe a Lord Haldane. Y esa es, de hecho, una gran deuda. Si se puede nombrar a un hombre que fuera absolutamente indispensable para la victoria, fue Haldane. Fue él quien construyó todo el espléndido arma que salió tan rápidamente de su funda y que Alemania quedó tan asombrada de encontrar dirigida a su pecho cuando avanzó furiosamente en su curso furioso. No podía hacer milagros; no podía introducir la conscripción cuando un candidato con tal programa habría sido perseguido en las elecciones; no podía preparar la mente pública de alguna manera dramática que hubiera precipitado el mismo choque que todavía había alguna posibilidad de evitar. Pero todo lo que teníamos nos lo dio: las ocho divisiones que salvaron a Francia, los Territoriales que llevaron a cabo el buen trabajo hasta que estuvieron listos los nuevos ejércitos, y el Cuerpo de Entrenamiento de Oficiales, que nos fortaleció donde hubiéramos estado fatalmente débiles. Nunca ha habido una conmoción tan tonta e ingrata como la que se ha levantado contra Haldane. Recuerdo que cuando presidió la silla para mí en la primera conferencia de guerra que di en Londres hubo gritos de \\"¡Traidor!\\" de la gente, principalmente mujeres, entre el público. Nunca antes había visto a Haldane y nunca lo he visto desde entonces, así que no tengo ningún sesgo personal en el asunto, pero estoy orgulloso de que fue en mi primer volumen de la \\"Historia de la Guerra\\", publicado en 1915, que yo por primera vez presenté la impopular opinión que ahora será más ampliamente aceptada. Con George Meredith tuve varias conexiones interesantes. Tengo la mayor admiración posible por él en su mejor momento, mientras que su peor es una carga tal que creo que arrastrará cuatro quintas partes de su obra al olvido. Si su propia generación lo encuentra difícil de entender, ¿qué harán nuestros descendientes con él? Será un culto entre pocos,"},{"prompt":"Traduce -> With George Meredith I had several interesting connections. I have the greatest possible admiration for him at his best, while his worst is such a handicap that I think it will drag four-fifths of his work to oblivion. If his own generation finds him hard to understand, what will our descendants make of him? He will be a cult among a few—a precious few in every sense. And yet I fully recognize that his was the most active original brain and the most clever pen of any man, novelist or otherwise, of my time. Knowing this well, it is strange that I can see so limited a future for him. His subtle and intricate mind seemed unable to realize the position of the plain outsiders who represent the world. He could not see how his stained-glass might be less effective than the plain transparent substance as a medium for vision. The first requisite is to be intelligible. The second is to be interesting. The third is to be clever. Meredith enormously filled the third, but he was unequal upon the other two. Hence he will never, in spite of the glories of \\"Richard Feverel\\" be on an equality with Dickens or Thackeray, who filled all three. He had simply no idea how his words would strike a less complex mind. I remember that once in the presence of Barrie, Quiller-Couch and myself, he read out a poem which he had inscribed \\"To the British Working-Man\\" in the \\"Westminster Gazette.\\" I don't know what the British working-man made of it, but I am sure that we three were greatly puzzled as to what it was about. I had written some articles on his work, which had been one of my youthful cults, and that led to his inviting me to see him at his villa at Box Hill—the first of several such visits. There had been a good deal in the papers about his health, so that I was surprised when, as I opened the garden gate, a slight but robust gentleman in a grey suit and a red tie swung out of the hall door and came singing loudly down the path. I suppose he was getting on to seventy at the time but he looked younger, and his artistic face was good to the eye. Greeting me he pointed to a long steep hill behind the house and said: \\"I have just been up to the top for a walk.\\" I looked at the sharp slope and said: \\"You must be in good trim to do it.\\" He looked angry and said: \\"That would be a proper compliment to pay to an octogenarian.\\" I was a little nettled by his touchiness, so I answered: \\"I understood that I was talking to an invalid.\\" It really seemed as if my visit would terminate at the garden gate, but presently he relented, and we soon became quite friendly. He had in his youth been a judge of wine, and had still a reverence for a good vintage, but unfortunately some nervous complaint from which he suffered had caused the doctors to prohibit it absolutely. When lunch came round he asked me with a very earnest air whether I could undertake to drink a whole bottle of Burgundy. I answered that I saw no insuperable difficulty. A dusty old bottle was tenderly carried up, which I disposed of, Meredith taking a friendly interest in its dispatch. \\"The fact is,\\" said he, \\"I love my wine, and my little cellar was laid down with care and judgment, so that when some guest comes and drinks a glass and wastes the rest of the bottle it goes to my heart. It really did me good to see you enjoy that one.\\" I need not say that I intimated that I was always prepared to oblige. His conversation was extraordinarily vivid and dramatic, uttered in a most vehement tone. It may have been artificial, and it may have been acting, but it was very arresting and entertaining. The talk got upon Napoleon's Marshals, and you would have thought that he knew them intimately, and he did Murat's indignation at being told to charge au bout, as if he ever charged any other way, in a fashion which would have brought down the house. Every now and then he brought out a Meredithian sentence which sounded comic when applied to domestic matters. When the jelly swayed about as the maid put it on the table he said: \\"The jelly, Mary, is as treacherous as the Trojan Horse.\\" He laughed when I told him how my groom, enlisted as a waiter for some special dinner, said, \\"Huddup, there,\\" to the jelly under similar circumstances. After lunch we walked up a steep path to the little chalet or summerhouse where he used to write. He wished to read me a novel which he had begun twenty years before, but which he had not had the heart to go on with. I liked it greatly—and we roared with laughter at his description of an old sea-dog who turned up the collar of his coat when he went into action as if the bullets were rain. He said that my hearty enjoyment encouraged him to go on with it, and it has since appeared as the \\"Amazing Marriage,\\" but whether I really had anything to do with it I do not know. I should be proud to think so. The nervous complaint from which he suffered caused him to fall down occasionally. As we walked up the narrow path to the chalet I heard him fall behind me, but judged from the sound that it was a mere slither and could not have hurt him. Therefore I walked on as if I had heard nothing. He was a fiercely proud old man, and my instincts told me that his humiliation in being helped up would be far greater than any relief I could give him. It was certainly a nice point to decide. George Meredith's religious convictions were very difficult to decide. He certainly had no glimmering so far as I could see of any psychic element in life, and I should imagine that on the whole he shared the opinions of his friend, John Morley, which were completely negative. And yet I remember his assuring me that prayer was a very necessary thing, and that one should never abandon prayer. \\"Who rises from prayer a better man, his prayer is granted,\\" says the Aphorist in \\"Richard Feverel.\\" How far these positions can be harmonized I do not know. I suppose that one may say that God is unknown, and yet rear a mental temple to the unknown God. Rudyard Kipling I know far less than I should, considering how deeply I admire his writings, and that we live in the same county; but we are both absorbed in work, and both much away from home, which may explain it. I can well remember how eagerly I bought his first book, \\"Plain Tales,\\" in the old Southsea days, when buying a book was a rare strain upon my exchequer. I read it with delight, and realized not only that a new force had arisen in literature, but that a new method of story writing had appeared which was very different from my own adherence to the careful plot artfully developed. This was go-as-you-please take-it-or-leave-it work, which glowed suddenly up into an incandescent phrase or paragraph, which was the more effective for its sudden advent. In form his stories were crude, and yet in effect—which, after all, is everything—they were superb. It showed me that methods could not be stereotyped, and that there was a more excellent way, even if it were beyond my reach. I loved the \\"Barrack Room Ballads\\" also, and such poems as \\"The Bolivar,\\" \\"East and West,\\" and above all the badly named \\"Envoi\\" became part of my very self. I always read the last one aloud to my little circle before we start on any fresh expedition, because it contains the very essence of travel, romance, and high adventure. I saw Kipling most nearly in his very early days when he lived at Brattleboro', a little village in Vermont, in a chivalrous desire to keep his newly married wife in touch with her own circle. In 1894, as I have recorded, there was a good deal of tail-twisting going on in the States, and Kipling pulled a few feathers out of the Eagle's tail in retaliation, which caused many screams of protest, for the American was far more sensitive to such things than the case-hardened Briton. I say \\"was,\\" for I think as a nation with an increased assurance of their own worth and strength they are now more careless of criticism. The result at the time was to add oil to flames, and I, as a passionate believer in Anglo-American union, wrote to Kipling to remonstrate. He received my protest very good-humouredly, and it led to my visit to his country home. As a matter of fact, the concern shown in America, when the poet lay at death's door a few years later, showed that the rancour was not very deep. Perhaps he was better known at that time in America than in England, for I remember sitting beside a busman in London, who bowed his red face to my ear and said: \\"Beg your pardon, sir, but 'oo is this 'ere Kilpin?\\" I had two great days in Vermont, and have a grateful remembrance of Mrs. Kipling's hospitality. The poet read me \\"McAndrew's Hymn,\\" which he had just done, and surprised me by his dramatic power which enabled him to sustain the Glasgow accent throughout, so that the angular Scottish greaser simply walked the room. I had brought up my golf clubs and gave him lessons in a field while the New England rustics watched us from afar, wondering what on earth we were at, for golf was unknown in America at that time. We parted good friends, and the visit was an oasis in my rather dreary pilgrimage as a lecturer. My glimpses of Kipling since then have been few and scattered, but I had the pleasure several times of meeting his old father, a most delightful and lovable person, who told a story quite as well as his famous son. As the mother was also a very remarkable woman, it is no wonder that he carried such a cargo. James Barrie is one of my oldest literary friends, and I knew him within a year or two of the time when we both came to London. He had just written his \\"Window in Thrums,\\" and I, like all the world, acclaimed it. When I was lecturing in Scotland in 1893 he invited me to Kirriemuir, when I stayed some days with his family—splendid types of the folk who have made Scotland great. His father was a fine fellow, but his mother was wonderful with a head and a heart—rare combinations—which made me class her with my own mother. Kirriemuir could by no means understand Barrie's success, and looked upon their great son as an inexplicable phenomenon. They were acutely aware, however, that tourists were arriving from all parts to see the place on account of Barrie's books. \\"I suppose you have read them,\\" I said to the wife of the local hotel man. \\"Aye, I've read them, and steep, steep, weary work it was,\\" said she. She had some theory that it was a four-horse coach which her good man was running, and not the books at all which accounted for the boom. Great as are Barrie's plays — and some of them I think are very great — I wish he had never written a line for the theatre. The glamour of it and the—to him—easy success have diverted from literature the man with the purest style of his age. Plays are always ephemeral, however good, and are limited to a few, but Barrie's unborn books might have been an eternal and a universal asset of British literature. He has the chaste clarity which is the great style, which has been debased by a generation of wretched critics who have always confused what is clear with what is shallow, and what is turbid with what is profound. If a man's thought is precise, his rendering of it is precise, and muddy thoughts make obscure paragraphs. If I had to make my choice among modern stylists, I should pick Barrie for the lighter forms of expression and our British Winston Churchill for the more classical. Barrie's great play — one of the finest in the language — is of course \\"The Admirable Crichton.\\" I shall always hope that I had a hand in the fashioning of it. I say this not in complaint but in satisfaction, for we all drop seeds into each other, and seldom know whence they come. We were walking together on the Heath at Kirriemuir when I said: \\"I had a quaint thought in the night, Barrie. It was that a king was visiting India and was wrecked on the way on some island far from the track of ships. Only he and one rather handy sailor were saved. They settled down to spend their lives together. Of course the result would be that the sailor would become the king and the king the subject.\\" We chuckled over the idea, and when Crichton appeared, I seemed to see the fine plant which had grown from the tiny seed. Barrie and I had one unfortunate venture together, in which I may say that the misfortune was chiefly mine, since I had really nothing to do with the matter, and yet shared all the trouble. However, I should have shared the honour and profit in case of success, so that I have no right to grumble. The facts were that Barrie had promised Mr. D'Oyley Carte that he would provide the libretto of a light opera for the Savoy. This was in the Gilbert days, when such a libretto was judged by a very high standard. It was an extraordinary commission for him to accept, and I have never yet been able to understand why he did so, unless, like Alexander, he wanted fresh worlds to conquer. On this occasion, however, he met with a disastrous repulse, and the opera, \\"Jane Annie,\\" to which I alluded in an early chapter, was one of the few failures in his brilliant career. I was brought into the matter because Barrie's health failed on account of some family bereavement. I had an urgent telegram from him at Aldburgh, and going there I found him very worried because he had bound himself by this contract, and he felt in his present state unable to go forward with it. There were to be two acts, and he had written the first one, and had the rough scenario of the second, with the complete sequence of events—if one may call it a sequence. Would I come in with him and help him to complete it as part author? Of course I was very happy to serve him in any way. My heart sank, however, when, after giving the promise, I examined the work. The only literary gift which Barrie has not got is the sense of poetic rhythm, and the instinct for what is permissible in verse. Ideas and wit were there in abundance. But the plot itself was not strong, though the dialogue and the situations also were occasionally excellent. I did my best and wrote the lyrics for the second act, and much of the dialogue, but it had to take the predestined shape. The result was not good. However, the actual comradeship of production was very amusing and interesting, and our failure was mainly painful to us because it let down the producer and the cast. We were well abused by the critics, but Barrie took it all in the bravest spirit. I find, in looking over my papers, a belated statement of account from Barrie which is good reading. IN ACCOUNT WITH J. M. BARRIE Why. Cause of delay. Remarks. A £1 Lent at Station. Object moving too fast. Doyle says he lent it. B £12 Jane Annie on Tour. Moving or swaying of Kodak. Better late than never. C £30 6s. 4d, Heaven knows. Failure to pull cord. Doyle gets 2/5 of a penny beyond his share. Our association was never so closely renewed, but through all my changing life I have had a respect and affection for Barrie which were, I hope, mutual. How I collaborated with him at cricket as well as at work is told in my chapter on Sport. Henry Irving is one of the other great men whom I have met at close quarters, for his acting of Gregory Brewster brought us in contact. When he was producing \\"Coriolanus\\" he came down to Hindhead and used to drop in of an evening. He was fond of a glass of port—indeed, he was one of the four great men who were stated (probably untruly) by the Hon. G. Russell to drink a bottle each night—being the only trait which these great men had in common. The others, I remember, were Tennyson, Gladstone and Moses Montefiori, and the last I believe was really true. Like all bad habits, it overtook the sinner at last, and he was cut off at the age of 116. Irving had a curious dry wit which was occasionally sardonic and ill-natured. I can well believe that his rehearsals were often the occasion for heart-burnings among the men and tears among the ladies. The unexpectedness of his remarks took one aback. I remember when my friend Hamilton sat up with me into the \\"wee sma' hours\\" with the famous man, he became rather didactic on the subject of the Deity or the Universe or some other tremendous topic, which he treated very solemnly, and at great length. Irving sat with his intense eyes riveted upon the speaker's face, which encouraged Hamilton to go on and on. When at last he had finished, Irving remarked: \\"What a low comedian you would have made!\\" He wound up his visit by giving me his copy of \\"Coriolanus\\" with all his notes and stage directions—a very precious relic. Many visions of old times rise before my eyes as I write, but my book would lose all proportion should I dwell upon them. I see Henley, the formidable cripple, a red-bearded, loud-voiced buccaneer of a man who could only crawl, for his back appeared to be broken. He was a great poet and critic who seemed to belong to the roaring days of Marlowe of the mighty line and the pothouse fray. I see Haggard too, first as the young spruce diplomatist, later as the worn and bearded man with strange vague tendencies to mysticism. Shaw, too, I see with the pleasant silky voice and the biting phrase. It was strange that all the mild vegetables which formed his diet made him more pugnacious and, I must add, more uncharitable than the carnivorous man, so that I have known no literary man who was more ruthless to other people's feelings. And yet to meet him was always to like him. He could not resist a bitter jest or the perverted pleasure of taking up an unpopular attitude. As an example I remember Henry Irving telling me that when Shaw was invited to his father's funeral he wrote in reply: \\"If I were at Westminster Henry Irving would turn in his grave, just as Shakespeare would turn in his grave were Henry Irving at Stratford.\\" I may not have it verbally exact, but that was near enough. It was the kind of outrageous thing that he would say. And yet one can forgive him all when one reads the glorious dialogue of some of his plays. He seems subhuman in emotion and superhuman in intellect. Shaw was always a thorn in Irving's side, and was usually the one jarring note among the chorus of praise which greeted each fresh production. At a first night at the Lyceum—those wonderful first nights which have never been equalled—the lanky Irishman with his greenish face, his red beard, and his sardonic expression must have been like the death's-head at the banquet to Irving. Irving ascribed this animosity to Shaw's pique because his plays were not accepted, but in this I am sure that he did an injustice. It was simply that contrary twist in the man which makes him delight in opposing whatever anyone else approved. There is nothing constructive in him, and he is bound to be in perpetual opposition. No one for example was stronger for peace and for non-militarism than he, and I remember that when I took the chair at a meeting at Hindhead to back up the Tsar's peace proposals at The Hague, I thought to myself as I spied Shaw in a corner of the room: \\"Well, this time at any rate he must be in sympathy.\\" But far from being so he sprang to his feet and put forward a number of ingenious reasons why these proposals for peace would be disastrous. Do what you could he was always against you. Perhaps it is no bad thing to have the other point of view continually stated, and the British stand that sort of thing better than other nations. Had Shaw said in America what he said in England about the war whilst it was in progress he would have been in personal danger. There were times, however, when his queer contrary impulses became perfectly brutal in their working. One was at the time of the Titanic disaster, when he deliberately wrote a letter at a time when the wounds were raw, overwhelming every one concerned with bitter criticism. I was moved to write a remonstrance, and we had a sharp debate in public, which did not in any way modify our kindly personal relations. I can recall a smaller but even more unjustifiable example of his sour nature when he was staying at Hindhead. A garden-party had been got up for some charity, and it included the woodland scenes of \\"As You Like It,\\" which were done by amateurs, and very well done too. Shaw with no provocation wrote a whole column of abuse in the local paper, spattering all the actors and their performance with ridicule, and covering them with confusion, though indeed they had nothing to be ashamed of. One mentions these things as characteristic of one side of the man, and as a proof, I fear, that the adoption by the world of a vegetarian diet will not bring unkind thoughts or actions to an end. But with it all Shaw is a genial creature to meet, and I am pre-pared to believe that there is a human kindly side to his nature though it has not been presented to the public. It took a good man to write \\"Saint Joan.\\" Wells, too, I have known long, and indeed I must have often entered the draper's shop in which he was employed at Southsea, for the proprietor was a patient of mine. Wells is one of the great fruits which popular education has given us, since he came, as he is proud to state, from the heart of the people. His democratic frankness and complete absence of class feeling are occasionally embarrassing. I remember his asking me once if I had played cricket at Liphook. I said that I had. He said: \\"Did you notice an old fellow who acts as professional and ground-keeper?\\" I said that I had. \\"That was my father,\\" said Wells. I was too much surprised to answer, and could only congratulate myself that I had made no unpleasant comments before I knew the identity of the old man. I have always had my doubts as to those elaborate forecasts of the future in which Wells indulges. He has, it is true, made a couple of good shots which have already materialized in the tanks and in the machine which would deliver news in our own houses. But he has never shown any perception of the true meaning of the psychic, and for want of it his history of the world, elaborate and remarkable as it was, seemed to me to be a body without a soul. However, this also may be given him, and it will make his equipment complete. I remember discussing the matter with him, when George Gissing, Hornung, he and I foregathered in Rome early in this century, but apparently my words had no effect. Willie Hornung, my brother-in-law, is another of my vivid memories. He was a Dr. Johnson without the learning but with a finer wit. No one could say a neater thing, and his writings, good as they are, never adequately represented the powers of the man, nor the quickness of his brain. These things depend upon the time and the fashion, and go flat in the telling, but I remember how, when I showed him the record of some one who claimed to have done 100 yards under ten seconds, he said: \\"It is a sprinter's error.\\" Golf he could not abide, for he said it was \\"unsportsmanlike to hit a sitting ball.\\" His criticism upon my Sherlock Holmes was: \\"Though he might be more humble, there is no police like Holmes.\\" I think I may claim that his famous character Raffles was a kind of inversion of Sherlock Holmes, Bunny playing Watson. He admits as much in his kindly dedication. I think there are few finer examples of short-story writing in our language than these, though I confess I think they are rather dangerous in their suggestion. I told him so before he put pen to paper, and the result has, I fear, borne me out. You must not make the criminal a hero. Jerome, too, is an old friend. He is an adventurous soul, and at one time started a four-in-hand. I remember sitting on the top of it, and when one of the leaders turned right round and took a good look at the driver I thought it was time to get down. Maxwell also is an old friend. He is, of course, the son of Miss Braddon, who married a publisher of that name. I respect him for doing a man's work in the war when, though he was fifty years of age, and had led a sedentary life, he volunteered for a fighting battalion, a credit which he shares with A. E. W. Mason. Maxwell's work has always greatly appealed to me, and I have long looked upon him as the greatest novelist that we possess. I never met Robert Louis Stevenson in the flesh, though I owe so much to him in the literary spirit. Never can I forget the delight with which I read those early stories of his in the \\"Cornhill,\\" before I knew the name of the author. I still think that \\"The Pavilion on the Links\\" is one of the great short stories of the world, though there were alterations in the final form which were all for the worse, and showed prudery upon the part of the publishers. Stevenson's last year at Edinburgh University must have just about coincided with my first one, and Barrie must also have been in that grey old nest of learning about the year 1876. Strange to think that I probably brushed elbows with both of them in the crowded portal. From his far-away home in Samoa he seemed to keep a quick eye upon literary matters in England, and I had most encouraging letters from him in 1893 and 1894. \\"O frolic fellow-spookist\\" was his curious term of personal salutation in one of these, which showed that he shared my interest in psychic research but did not take it very seriously. I cannot guess how at that time he had detected it, though I was aware that he had himself in early days acted as secretary to a psychic research or rather to a spiritualist society in Edinburgh, which studied the remarkable mediumship of Duguid. His letters to me consisted of kind appreciation of my work. \\"I have a great talent for compliment,\\" he said, \\"accompanied by a hateful, even a diabolic, frankness.\\" He had been retailing some of my Sherlock Holmes yarns to his native servants—I should not have thought that he needed to draw upon anyone else—and he complained to me in a comical letter of the difficulty of telling a story when you had to halt every moment to explain what a railway was, what an engineer was, and so forth. He got the story across in spite of all difficulties, and, said he, \\"If you could have seen the bright feverish eyes of Simite you would have tasted glory.\\" But he explained that the natives took everything literally, and that there was no such thing as an imaginary story for them. \\"I, who write this, have had the indiscretion to perpetaate a trifling piece of fiction, 'The Bottle Imp. Parties who come up to visit my mansion, after having admired the ceiling by Vanderputty and the tapestry by Gobbling, manifest towards the end a certain uneasiness which proves them to be fellows of an infinite delicacy. They may be seen to shrug a brown shoulder, to roll up a speaking eye, and at last the secret bursts from them: 'Where is the bottle?' \\"In another letter he said that as I had written of my first book in the \\"Idler\\" he also would do so. \\"I could not hold back where the white plume of Conan Doyle waved in front of me.\\" So, at least, I may boast that it is to me that the world owes the little personal sketch about \\"Treasure Island\\" which appeared in that year. I cannot forget the shock that it was to me when driving down the Strand in a hansom cab in 1896 I saw upon a yellow evening poster \\"Death of Stevenson.\\" Some-thing seemed to have passed out of my world. I was asked by his executors to finish the novel \\"St. Ives,\\" which he had left three-quarters completed, but I did not feel equal to the task. It was done, however, and, I understand, very well done, by Quiller-Couch. It is a desperately difficult thing to carry on another man's story, and must be a more or less mechanical effort. I had one experience of it when my neighbour at Hindhead, Grant Allen, was on his death-bed. He was much worried because there were two numbers of his serial, \\"Hilda Wade,\\" which was running in \\"The Strand\\" magazine, still uncompleted. It was a pleasure for me to do them for him, and so relieve his mind, but it was difficult collar work, and I expect they were pretty bad. Some time afterwards a stranger, who evidently confused Allen and me, wrote to say that his wife had given him a baby girl, and that in honour of me he was calling her Hilda Wade. He was really nearer the truth than appeared at first sight. I well remember that death-bed of Grant Allen's. He was an agnostic of a type which came very near atheism, though in his private life an amiable and benevolent man. Believing what he did, the approach of death must have offered rather a bleak prospect, and as he had paroxysms of extreme pain the poor fellow seemed very miserable. I had often argued the case with him, I from a Theistic and he from a negative point of view, but I did not intrude my opinions or disturb his mind at that solemn moment. Death-bed changes, though some clergy may rejoice in them, are really vain things. His brain, however, was as clear as ever, and his mind was occupied with all manner of strange knowledge, which he imparted in the intervals of his pain, in the curious high nasal voice which was characteristic. I can see him now, his knees drawn up to ease internal pain, and his long thin nose and reddish-grey goatee protruding over the sheet, while he creaked out: \\"Byzantine art, my dear Doyle, was of three periods, the middle one roughly coinciding with the actual fall of the Roman Empire. The characteristics of the first period——\\" and so on, until he would give a cry, clasp his hands across his stomach, and wait till the pain passed before resuming his lecture. His dear little wife nursed him devotedly, and mitigated the gloom of those moments which can be made the very happiest in life if one understands what lies before one. One thinks, as a contrast, of Dr. Hodgson's impatient cry, \\"I can hardly wait for death!\\" Grant Allen's strong opinions in print, and a certain pleasure he took in defending outside positions, gave quite a false view of his character, which was gentle and benignant. I remember his coming to a fancy dress ball which we gave in the character of a Cardinal, and in that guise all the quiet dignity of the man seemed to come out and you realized how much our commonplace modern dress disguises the real man. He used to tell with great amusement how a couple, who afterwards became close friends, came first to call, and how as they waited on the doorstep the wife said to the husband: \\"Remember, John, if he openly blasphemes, I leave the room.\\" He had, I remember, very human relations with the maids who took a keen interest in their employer's scientific experiments. On one occasion these were connected with spiders, and the maid rushed into the drawing-room and cried: \\"Oh, sir, Araminta has got a wasp.\\" Araminta was the name given to the big spider which he was observing at the time. Grant Allen had no actual call to write fiction, but his brain was agile enough to make some sort of job of anything to which it turned. On the other hand, as a popular scientist he stood alone, or shared the honour with Samuel Laing. His only real success in fiction was the excellent short story John Creedy, where he combined science with fiction, with remarkable results. At the time when I and so many others turned to letters there was certainly a wonderful vacancy for the new-comer. The giants of old had all departed. Thackeray, Dickens, Charles Reade and Trollope were memories. There was no great figure remaining save Hardy rising. The novelist was Mrs. Humphrey Ward, who was just beginning her career with \\"Robert Elsmere,\\" the first of that series of novels which will illuminate the later Victorian era more clearly than any historian ever can do. I think it was Hodgkin who said, when he read \\"Count Robert of Paris \\": \\"Here have I been studying Byzantium all my life, and I never understood it until this blessed Scotch lawyer came along.\\" That is the special prerogative of imagination. Trollope and Mrs. Ward have the whole Victorian civilization dissected and preserved. Then there were Meredith, unintelligible to most, and Walter Besant. There was Wilkie Collins, too, with his fine stories of mystery, and finally there was James Payn. Payn was much greater than his books. The latter were usually rather mechanical, but to get at the real man one has to read such articles as his \\"Literary Reminiscences,\\" and especially his \\"Backwater of Life.\\" He had all that humorous view which Nature seems to give as a compensation to those whose strength is weak. Had Payn written only essays he would have rivalled Charles Lamb. I knew him best in his latter days, when he was crippled with illness, and his poor fingers so twisted with rheumatic arthritis that they seemed hardly human. He was intensely pessimistic as to his own fate. \\"Don't make any mistake, Doyle, death is a horrible thing—horrible! I suffer the agonies of the damned!\\" But five minutes later he would have his audience roaring with laughter, and his own high treble laugh would be the loudest of all. His own ailments were frequently a source of mirth. I remember how he described the breaking of a blood-vessel in Bournemouth and how they carried him home on a litter. He was dimly conscious of the fir-woods through which he passed. \\"I thought it was my funeral, and that they had done me well in the matter of plumes.\\" When he told a story he was so carried away by his sense of humour that he could hardly get the end out, and he finished up in a kind of scream. An American had called upon him at some late hour and had discoursed upon Assyrian tablets. \\"I thought they were something to eat,\\" he screamed. He was an excellent whist player, and the Baldwin Club used to send three members to his house on certain days so that the old fellow should not go without his game. This game was very scientific. He would tell with delight how he asked some novice: \\"Do you play the penultimate?\\" To which the novice answered: \\"No—but my brother plays the American organ.\\" Many of my generation of authors had reason to love him, for he was a human and kindly critic. His writing however, was really dreadful. It was of him that the story was told than an author handed one of his letters to a chemist for a test. The chemist retired for a time and then returned with a bottle and demanded half a crown. Better luck attended the man who received an illegible letter from a railway director. He used it as a free pass upon the line. Payn used to joke about his own writing, but it was a very real trouble when one could not make out whether he had accepted or rejected one's story. There was one letter in which I could only read the words \\"infringement of copyright.\\" He was very funny when he described the work of the robust younger school. \\"I have received a story from——\\" he said, \\"5,000 words, mostly damns.\\" I knew Sir Henry Thompson, the famous surgeon, very well, and was frequently honoured by an invitation to his famous octave dinners, at which eight carefully chosen male guests were always the company. They always seemed to me to be the most wonderful exhibitions of unselfishness, for Thompson was not allowed any alcohol, or anything save the most simple viands. Possibly, however, like Meredith and the bottle of burgundy, he enjoyed some reflex pleasure from-the enjoyment of others. He had been a wonderful viveur and judge of what was what, and I fear that I disappointed him, for I was much more interested in the conversation than the food, and it used to annoy me when some argument was interrupted in order to tell us that it was not ordinary ham but a Westphalian wild boar that we were eating and that it had been boiled in wine for precisely the right time prescribed by the best authorities. But it was part of his wonderful unselfish hospitality to make his guests realize exactly what it was that was set before them. I have never heard more interesting talk than at these male gatherings, for it is notorious that though ladies greatly improve the appearance of a feast they usually detract from the quality of the talk. Few men are ever absolutely natural when there are women in the room. There was one special dinner, I fancy it was the hundredth of the series, which was particularly interest-ing as the Prince of Wales, now George V, was one of the eight, and gave us a most interesting account of the voyage round the world from which he had just returned. Of the rest of the company I can only recall Sir Henry Stanley, the traveller, and Sir Crichton Browne. Twenty years later I met the King when he visited a trade exhibition, and I attended as one of the directors of Tuck's famous postcard firm. He at once said: \\"Why, I have not seen you since that pleasant dinner when you sat next to me at Sir Henry Thompson's.\\" It seemed to me to be a remarkable example of the royal gift of memory. I have not often occupied a chair among the seats of the mighty. My life has been too busy and too preoccupied to allow me to stray far from my beaten path. The mention of the Prince, however, reminds me of the one occasion when I was privileged to entertain—or to attempt to entertain—the present Queen. It was at a small dinner to which I was invited by the courtesy of Lord Midleton whose charming wife, once Madeleine Stanley daughter of Lady Helier, I could remember since her girlhood. Upon this occasion the Prince and Princess came in after dinner, the latter sitting alone at one end of the room with a second chair beside her own, which was occupied successively by the various gentlemen who were to be introduced to her. I was led up in due course, made my bow, and sat down at her request. I confess that I found it heavy going at first, for I had heard somewhere that Royalty has to make the first remark, and had it been the other way there was such a gulf between us that I should not have known where to begin. However she was very pleasant and gracious and began asking me some questions about my works which brought me on to very easy ground. Indeed, I became so interested in our talk that I was quite disappointed when Mr. John Morley was led up, and I realized that it was time for me to vacate the chair. There was another amusing incident on that eventful evening. I had been asked to take in Lady Curzon, whose husband, then Viceroy of India, had been unable to attend. The first couple had passed in and there was a moment's hesitation as to who should go next, but Lady Curzon and I were nearest the door, so possibly with some little encouragement from the lady we filed through. I thought nothing of the incident but some great authority upon these matters came to me afterwards in great excitement. \\"Do you know,\\" he said, \\"that you have established a precedent and solved one of the most difficult and debatable matters of etiquette that has ever caused ill-feeling in British Society?\\" \\"The Lord Chancellor and the College of Heralds should be much obliged to you, for you have given them a definite lead. There has never been so vexed a question as to whether a Vice-reine when she is away from the country where she represents royalty shall take precedence over a Duchess. There was a Duchess in the room, but you by your decided action have settled the matter for ever.\\" So who shall say that I have done nothing in my life? Of the distinguished lights of the law whom I have met from time to time I think that Sir Henry Hawkins—then become Lord Bampton—made the most definite impression. I met him at a week-end gathering at Cliveden, when Mr. Astor was our host. On the first night at dinner, before the party had shaken down into mutual acquaintance, the ex-judge, very old and as bald as an ostrich egg, was seated opposite, and was wreathed with smiles as he made himself agreeable to his neighbour. His appearance was so jovial that I remarked to the lady upon my left: \\"It is curious to notice the appearance of our vis-â-vis and to contrast it with his reputation,\\" alluding to his sinister record as an inexorable judge. She seemed rather puzzled by my remark, so I added: \\"Of course you know who he is.\\" \\"Yes,\\" said she, \\"his name is Conan Doyle and he writes novels.\\" I was hardly middle-aged at the time and at my best physically, so that I was amused at her mistake, which arose from some confusion in the list of guests. I put my dinner card up against her wine-glass, so after that we got to know each other. Hawkins was a most extraordinary man, and so capricious that one never knew whether one was dealing with Jekyll or with Hyde. It was certainly Hyde when he took eleven hours summing up in the Penge case, and did all a man could do to have all four of the prisoners condemned to death. Sir Edward Clarke was so incensed at his behaviour on this occasion that he gave notice when Hawkins retired from the bench that if there were the usual complimentary ceremonies he would protest. So they were dropped. I might, on the other hand, illustrate the Jekyll side of him by a story which he told me with his own lips. A prisoner had a pet mouse. One day the brute of a warder deliberately trod upon it. The prisoner caught up his dinner knife and dashed at the warder, who only just escaped, the knife stabbing the door as it closed behind him. Hawkins as judge wanted to get the man off, but the attempt at murder was obvious and the law equally clear. What was he to do? In his charge to the jury he said: \\"If a man tries to kill another in a way which is on the face of it absurd, it becomes a foolish rather than a criminal act. If, for example, a man in London discharged a pistol to hurt a man in Edinburgh, we could only laugh at such an offence. So also when a man stabs an iron-plated door while another man is at the other side of it we cannot take it seriously.\\" The jury, who were probably only too glad to follow such a lead, brought in a verdict of \\"Not guilty.\\" Another distinguished man of the law who left a very clear impression upon my mind was Sir Francis Jeune, afterwards Lord St. Helier. I attended several of Lady Jeune's famous luncheon parties, which were quite one of the outstanding institutions of London, like Gladstone's breakfasts in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. I am indebted to this lady for very many kind actions. Her husband always impressed me with his gentle wisdom and with his cultivated taste. He told me that if every copy of Horace were destroyed he thought that he could reconstruct most of it from memory. He presided over the Divorce Courts, and I remember upon one occasion I said to him: \\"You must have a very low opinion of human nature, Sir Francis, since the worst side of it is for ever presented towards you.\\" \\"On the contrary,\\" said he very earnestly, \\"my experience in the Divorce Courts has greatly raised my opinion of humanity. There is so much chivalrous self-sacrifice, and so much disposition upon the part of every one to make the best of a bad business that it is extremely edifying.\\" This view seemed to me to be worth recording.

Grace — Queer Experiences — Tragic Matches — Humiliation — Success in Holland — Barrie's Team — A Precedent — Motor Accidents — Prince Henry Tour — Aviation — The Balloon and the Aeroplane — Ski — Over a Precipice — Rifle Shooting. It is here — before we approach what Maxwell has called \\"The Great Interruption\\" — that I may perhaps break my narrative in order to interpolate a chapter upon the general subject of my experiences of sport, which have taken up an appreciable part of my life, added greatly to its pleasure, and which can be better treated as a whole than recounted seriatim. It may best be fitted in at this spot as my sporting life one way and another may be said to have reached its modest zenith about that time. As one grows old one looks back at one's career in sport as a thing completed. Yet I have at least held on to it as long as I could, for I played a hard match of Association football at forty-four, and I played cricket for ten years more. I have never specialized, and have therefore been a second-rater in all things. I have made up for it by being an all-rounder, and have had, I dare say, as much fun out of sport as many an adept. It would be odd if a man could try as many games as I for so many years without having some interesting experiences or forming a few opinions which would bear recording and discussion. And first of all let me \\"damn the sins I have no mind to\\" by recording what most of my friends will regard as limitation. I never could look upon flat-racing as a true sport. Sport is what a man does, not what a horse does. Skill and judgment are shown, no doubt, by the professional jockeys, but I think it may be argued that in nine cases out of ten the best horse wins, and would have equally won, could his head be kept straight, had there been a dummy on his back. But making every allowance, on the one side, for what human qualities may be called forth, and for any improvement of the breed of horses (though I am told that the same pains in other directions would produce infinitely more fruitful and generally useful results), and putting on the other side the demoralization from betting, the rascality among some book-makers, and the collection of undesirable characters brought together by a race meeting, I cannot avoid the conclusion that the harm greatly outweighs the good from a broadly national point of view. Yet I recognize, of course, that it is an amusement which lies so deeply in human nature—the oldest, perhaps, of all amusements which have come down to us—that it must have its place in our system until the time may come when it will be gradually modified, developing, perhaps, some purifying change, as prize-fighting did when it turned to contests with the gloves. I have purposely said \\"flat-racing,\\" because I think a stronger case, though not, perhaps, an entirely sound one, could be made out for steeple-chasing. Eliminate the mob and the money, and then, surely, among feats of human skill and hardihood there are not many to match that of the winner of a really stiff point-to-point, while the man who rides at the huge barriers of the Grand National has a heart for anything. As in the old days of the ring, it is not the men nor the sport, but it is the followers who cast a shadow on, the business. Go down to Waterloo and meet any returning race train, if you doubt it. If I have alienated half my readers by my critical attitude to the Turf, I shall probably offend the other half by stating that I cannot persuade myself that we are justified in taking life as a pleasure. To shoot for the pot must be right, since man must feed, and to kill creatures which live upon others (the hunting of foxes, for example) must also be right, since to slay one is to save many; but the rearing of birds in order to kill them, and the shooting of such sensitive and inoffensive animals as hares and deer, cannot, I think, be justified. I must admit that I shot a good deal before I came to this conclusion. Perhaps the fact, while it prevents my assuming any airs of virtue, will give my opinion greater weight, since good shooting is still within my reach, and I know nothing more exhilarating than to wait on the borders of an autumn-tinted wood, to hear the crackling advance of beaters, to mark the sudden whirr and the yell of \\"Mark over,\\" and then, over the topmost branches, to see a noble cock pheasant whizzing down wind at a pace which pitches him a 100 yards behind you when you have dropped him. But when your moment of exultation is over, and you note what a beautiful creature he is and how one instant of your pleasure has wrecked him, you feel that you had better think no longer if you mean to slip two more cartridges into your gun and stand by for another. Worse still is it when you hear the child-like wail of the wounded hare. I should think that there are few sportsmen who have not felt a disgust at their own handiwork when they have heard it. So, too, when you see the pheasant fly on with his legs showing beneath him as sign that he is hard hit. He drops into the thick woods and is lost to sight. Perhaps it is as well for your peace of mind that he should be lost to thought also. Of course, one is met always by the perfectly valid argument that the creatures would not live at all if it were not for the purposes of sport, and that it is presumably better from their point of view that they should eventually meet a violent death than that they should never have existed. No doubt this is true. But there is another side of the question as to the effect of the sport upon ourselves—whether it does not blunt our own better feelings, harden our sympathies, brutalize our natures. A coward can do it as well as a brave man; a weakling can do it as well as a strong man. There is no ultimate good from it. Have we a moral right then, to kill creatures for amusement? I know many of the best and most kind-hearted men who do it, but still I feel that in a more advanced age it will no longer be possible. And yet I am aware of my own inconsistency when I say I am in sympathy with fishing, and would gladly have a little if I knew where to get it. And yet, is it wholly inconsistent? Is a cold-blooded creature of low organization like a fish to be regarded in the same way as the hare which cries out in front of the beagles, or the deer which may carry the rifle bullet away in its side? If there is any cruelty it is surely of a much less degree. Besides, is it not the sweet solitude of Nature, the romantic quest, rather than the actual capture which appeals to the fisherman? One thinks of the stories of trout and salmon which have taken another fly within a few minutes of having broken away from a former one, and one feels that their sense of pain must be very different from our own. I once had the best of an exchange of fishing stories, which does not sound like a testimonial to my veracity. It was in a Birmingham inn, and a commercial traveller was boasting of his successes. I ventured to back the weight of the last three fish which I had been concerned in catching against any day's take of his lifetime. He closed with the bet and quoted some large haul, 100 lbs. or more. \\"Now, sir,\\" he asked triumphantly, \\"what was the weight of your three fish?\\" \\"Just over 200 tons,\\" I answered. \\"Whales?\\" \\"Yes, three Greenland whales.\\" \\"I give you best,\\" he cried; but whether as a fisherman, or as a teller of fish stories, I am not sure. As a matter of fact, I had only returned that year from the Arctic seas, and the three fish in question were, in truth, the last which I had helped to catch. My experiences during my Arctic voyage both with whales and bears I have already touched upon, so I will not refer to them again, though it was the greatest period of sport which has ever come my way. I have always been keen upon the noble old English sport of boxing, and, though of no particular class myself, I suppose I might describe my form as that of a fair average amateur. I should have been a better man had I taught less and learned more, but after my first tuition I had few chances of professional teaching. However, I have done a good deal of mixed boxing among many different types of men, and had as much pleasure from it as from any form of sport. It stood me in good stead aboard the whaler. On the very first evening I had a strenuous bout with the steward, who was an excellent sportsman. I heard him afterwards, through the partition of the cabin, declare that I was \\"the best sur-r-r-geon we've had, Colin—he's blacked my ee.\\" It struck me as a singular test of my medical ability, but I dare say it did no harm. I remember when I was a medical practitioner going down to examine a man's life for insurance in a little Sussex village. He was the gentleman farmer of the place, and a most sporting and jovial soul. It was a Saturday, and I enjoyed his hospitality that evening, staying over till Monday. After breakfast it chanced that several neighbours dropped in, one of whom, an athletic young farmer, was fond of the gloves. Conversation soon brought out the fact that I had a weakness in the same direction. The result was obvious. Two pairs of gloves were hunted from some cupboard, and in a few minutes we were hard at it, playing light at first and letting out as we warmed. It was soon clear that there was no room inside a house for two heavy-weights, so we adjourned to the front lawn. The main road ran across the end of it, with a low wall of just the right height to allow the village to rest its elbows on it and enjoy the spectacle. We fought several very brisk rounds, with no particular advantage either way, but the contest always stands out in my memory for its queer surroundings and the old English picture in which it was set. It is one of several curious bye-battles in my career. I recollect another where another man and I, returning from a ball at five of a summer morning, went into his room and fought in our dress clothes several very vigorous rounds as a wind-up to the evening's exercise. They say that every form of knowledge comes useful sooner or later. Certainly my own experience in boxing and my very large acquaintance with the history of the prize-ring found their scope when I wrote \\"Rodney Stone.\\" No one but a fighting man would ever, I think, quite understand or appreciate some of the detail. A friend of mine read the scene where Boy Jim fights Berks to a prize-fighter as he lay in what proved to be his last illness. The man listened with growing animation until the reader came to the point where the second advises Boy Jim, in technical jargon, how to get at his awkward antagonist. \\"That's it! By God, he's got him!\\" shouted the man in the bed. It was an incident which gave me pleasure when I heard it. I have never concealed my opinion that the old prize-ring was an excellent thing from a national point of view—exactly as glove-fighting is now. Better that our sports should be a little too rough than that we should run a risk of effeminacy. But the ring outlasted its time. It was ruined by the villainous mobs who cared nothing for the chivalry of sport or the traditions of British fair play as compared with the money gain which the contest might bring. Their blackguardism drove out the good men—the men who really did uphold the ancient standards, and so the whole institution passed into rottenness and decay. But now the glove contests carried on under the discipline of the National Sporting or other clubs perpetuate the noble old sport without a possibility of the more evil elements creeping into it once more. An exhibition of hardihood without brutality, of good-humoured courage without savagery, of skill without trickery, is, I think, the very highest which sport can give. People may smile at the mittens, but a twenty-round contest with four-ounce gloves is quite as punishing an ordeal as one could wish to endure. There is as little room for a coward as in the rougher days of old, and the standard of endurance is probably as high as in the average prize-fight. One wonders how our champions of to-day would have fared at the hands of the heroes of the past. I know something of this end of the question, for I have seen nearly all the great boxers of my time, from J. L. Sullivan down to Tommy Burns, Carpentier, Bombardier Wells, Beckett and that little miracle Jimmy Wilde. But how about the other end—the men of old? Wonderful Jem Mace was the only link between them. On the one hand, he was supreme in the 'sixties as a knuckle-fighter; on the other, he gave the great impetus to glove-fighting in America, and more especially in Australia, which has brought over such champions as Frank Slavin and Fitzsimmons, who, through Mace's teaching, derive straight from the classic line of British boxers. He of all men might have drawn a just comparison between the old and the new. But even his skill and experience might be at fault, for it is notorious that many of the greatest fighters under the old régime were poor hands with the mittens. Men could bang poor Tom Sayers all round the ring with the gloves, who would not have dared to get over the ropes had he been without them. I have seen Mace box, and even when over sixty it is wonderful how straight was his left, how quick his feet, and how impregnable his guard. After the Great War, one can see that those of us who worked for the revival of boxing wrought better than we knew, for at the supreme test of all time—the test which has settled the history of the future—it has played a marked part. I do not mean that a man used his fists in the war, but I mean—and every experienced instructor will, I am sure, endorse it—that the combative spirit and aggressive quickness gave us the attacking fire and helped especially in bayonet work. But it was to our allies of France that the chief advantage came. I believe that Carpentier, the boxer, did more to win the war for France than any other man save the actual generals or politicians. The public proof that a Frenchman could be at the very head of his class, as Ledoux was also at a lighter weight, gives a physical self-respect to a nation which tinges the spirit of every single member of it. It was a great day for France when English sports, boxing, Rugby football and others came across to them, and when a young man's ideal ceased to be amatory adventure with an occasional duel. England has taught Europe much, but nothing of more value than this. To return to my own small experiences of the game, I might have had one very notable one, for I was asked to referee the great contest when the champions of the white and black races fought for what may prove to be almost the last time. My first intimation was a cable followed by the following letter:— NEW YORK, December 9, 1909. MY DEAR SIR,— I hope you will pardon the liberty I took as a stranger in cabling to you asking if you would act at the championship battle between Jeffries and Johnson. The fact is that when the articles were signed recently your name was suggested for referee, and Tex Rickard, promoter of the fight, was greatly interested, as were many others. I believe it will interest you to know that the opinion was unanimous that you would do admirably in the position. In a voting contest several persons sent in your name as their choice. Believe me among sporting men of the best class in America you have many strong admirers; your splendid stories of the ring, and your avowed admiration for the great sport of boxing have made you thousands of friends. It was because of this extremely friendly feeling for you in America that I took the liberty of cabling to you. I thank you for your reply. It would indeed rejoice the hearts of the men in this country if you were at the ring side when the great negro fighter meets the white man Jeffries for the world's championship. I am, my dear Sir, Yours sincerely, IRVING <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Managing Editor New York Morning Telegraph. I was much inclined to accept this honourable invitation, though my friends pictured me as winding up with a revolver at one ear and a razor at the other. However, the distance and my engagements presented a final bar. If boxing is the finest single man sport, I think that Rugby football is the best collective one. Strength, courage, speed and resource are great qualities to include in a single game. I have always wished that it had come more my way in life, but my football was ruined, as many a man's is, by the fact that at my old school they played a hybrid game peculiar to the place, with excellent points of its own, but unfitting the youngster for any other. All these local freak games, wall games, Winchester games, and so on are national misfortunes, for while our youths are wasting their energies upon them—those precious early energies which make the instinctive players—the young South African or New Zealander is brought up on the real universal Rugby, and so comes over to pluck a few more laurel leaves out of our depleted wreath. In Australia I have seen in Victoria a hybrid, though excellent game of their own, but they have had the sense in other parts to fall into line, and are already taking the same high position which they hold in other branches of sport. I hope that our headmasters will follow the same course. In spite of my wretched training I played for a short time as a forward in the Edinburgh University team, but my want of knowledge of the game was too heavy a handicap. Afterwards I took to Association, and played first goal and then back for Portsmouth, when that famous club was an amateur organization. Even then we could put a very fair team in the field, and were runners-up for the County Cup the last season that I played. In the same season I was invited to play for the county. I was always too slow, however, to be a really good back, though I was a long and safe kick. After a long hiatus I took up football again in South Africa and organized a series of inter-hospital matches in Bloemfontein which helped to take our minds away from enteric. My old love treated me very scurvily, however, for I received a foul from a man's knee which buckled two of my ribs and brought my games to a close. I have played occasionally since, but there is no doubt that as a man grows older a brisk charge shakes him up as it never did before. Let him turn to golf, and be thankful that there is still one splendid game which can never desert him. There may be objections to the \\"Royal and Ancient\\"—but a game which takes four miles of country for the playing must always have a majesty of its own. Personally I was an enthusiastic, but a very inefficient golfer—a ten at my best, and at my worst outside the pale of all decent handicaps. But surely it is a great testimony to the qualities of a game when a man can be both enthusiastic and inefficient. It is a proof at least that a man plays for the game's sake and not for personal kudos. Golf is the coquette of games. It always lures one on and always evades one. Ten years ago I thought I had nearly got it. I hope so to-day. But my scoring cards will show, I fear, that the coquette has not yet been caught. The elderly lover cannot hope to win her smile. I used in my early golfing days to practise on the very rudimentary links in front of the Mena Hotel, just under the Pyramids. It was a weird course, where, if you sliced your ball, you might find it bunkered in the grave of some Rameses or Thothmes of old. It was here, I believe, that the cynical stranger, after watching my energetic but ineffectual game, remarked that he had always understood that there was a special tax for excavating in Egypt. I have a pleasant recollection of Egyptian golf in a match played with the late Sirdar, then head of the Intelligence Department. When my ball was teed I observed that his negro caddie pointed two fingers at it and spat, which meant, as I was given to understand, that he cursed it for the rest of the game. Certainly I got into every hazard in the course, though I must admit that I have accomplished that when there was no Central African curse upon me. Those were the days before the reconquest of the Soudan, and I was told by Colonel Wingate—as he then was—that his spies coming down from Omdurman not infrequently delivered their messages to him while carrying his golf clubs, to avoid the attention of the Calipha's spies, who abounded in Cairo. On this occasion the Sirdar beat me well, but with a Christian caddie I turned the tables on him at Dunbar, and now we have signed articles to play off the rubber at Khartoum, no cursing allowed. When that first match was played we should as soon have thought of arranging to play golf in the moon. Every now and then I give up the game in disgust at my own incompetence, but only to be lured on once more. Hunting in an old desk I came upon an obituary which I had written for my game at some moment of special depression. It ran, \\"Sacred to the memory of my golf. It was never strong, being permanently afflicted with a deformed stance and an undeveloped swing. After long weakness cheerfully borne it finally succumbed, and was buried in the eighteenth hole, regretted by numerous caddies.\\" However it is out and about once more, none the worse for this premature interment. There is said to be a considerable analogy between golf and billiards, so much so that success in the one generally leads to success in the other. Personally, I have not found it so, for though I may claim, I suppose, to be above the average amateur at billiards, I am probably below him in golf. I have never quite attained the three-figure break, but I have so often topped the eighty, and even the ninety, that I have lived in constant hope. My friend, the late General Drayson, who was a great authority on the game, used to recommend that every player should ascertain what he called his \\"decimal,\\" by which he meant how many innings it took him, whether scoring or not, to make 100. The number, of course, varies with the luck of the balls and the mood of the player; but, taken over a dozen or twenty games, it gives a fair average idea of the player's form, and a man by himself can in this way test his own powers. If, for example, a player could, on an average, score 100 in twenty innings then his average would be five, which is very fair amateur form. If a man finds his \\"decimal\\" rise as high as ten over a sequence of games, he may be sure that he can hold his own against most players that he is likely to meet. I daresay my own decimal when I was in practice would be from six to eight. I was never good enough for the big matches, and though I once went in for the Amateur championship it was not out of any illusions about my game, but because I was specially asked to do so, as it was advisable to strengthen the undoubted amateur element in the contest. By the luck of a bye, and by beating a player who was about my own form, I got into the third round, when I ran across Mr. Evans, who eventually reached the final with my scalp as well as several others at his girdle. I made 650 against his 1,000, which, as I was not helped by a bad fall from a motor bike a few days before, was as much as I could expect. Forty-two off the red was my best effort. Surely billiards is the king of all indoor games, and should have some writer who would do for it in prose what John Nyren did for cricket. I have never seen any worthy appreciation of its infinite varieties from the forcing losing hazard which goes roaring into a top pocket with a clash upon the rail, to the feather stroke so delicate that it is only the quiver of reflected light upon the object ball which shows that it has indeed been struck. Greatest of all is the ball heavily loaded with side which drifts down the long cushion and then is sucked against every apparent law into the pocket as though it were the centre of a whirlpool. Mr. E. V. Lucas is one who could do it with discernment. I have one funny recollection of billiards, when I wandered into some small hotel in a South-Coast watering place, and for want of something to do played the marker. He was a pompous person in a frock coat with a very good opinion of his own game, which was really ruined by a habit he had of jerking. I won the match, which was not difficult to do, and then I thought it a kindness to point out to the man how he could improve his game. He took this badly, however, and hinted that he allowed gentlemen who played him to get the better of him. This in turn annoyed me, so I said: \\"Look here. I will come in after dinner and you can show all you can do, and you shall have a sovereign if you win.\\" After dinner his game was worse than ever, while I had amazing luck and made the 100 in about three shots. As I put on my coat and was leaving the room the queer little fellow sidled up to me and said: \\"I beg pardon, sir, but is your name Roberts?\\" My earliest recollection of cricket is not a particularly pleasant one. When I was a very small boy at a preparatory school I was one of a group of admirers who stood around watching a young cricketer who had just made his name hitting big hits off the school bowlers. One of the big hits landed on my knee-cap and the cricketer in his own famous arms carried me off to the school infirmary. The name, Tom Emmett, lingers in my memory, though it was some years before I appreciated exactly what he stood for in the game. I think, like most boys, I would rather have been knocked down by a first-class cricketer than picked up by a second-rater. That was the beginning of my acquaintance with a game which has on the whole given me more pleasure during my life than any other branch of sport. I have ended by being its victim, for a fast bowler some years ago happened to hit me twice in the same place under my left knee, which has left a permanent weakness. I have had as long an innings as one could reasonably expect, and carry many pleasant friendships and recollections away with me. I was a keen cricketer as a boy, but in my student days was too occupied to touch it. Then I took it up again, but my progress was interrupted by work and travel. I had some cause, therefore, to hold on to the game as I had lost so much of it in my youth. Finally, I fulfilled a secret ambition by getting into the fringe of first-class cricket, though rather, perhaps, through the good nature of others than my own merits. However, I can truly say that in the last season when I played some first-class cricket, including matches against Kent, Derbyshire, and the London County, I had an average of thirty-two for those games, so I may claim to have earned my place. I was more useful, however, in an amateur team, for I was a fairly steady and reliable bowler, and I could generally earn my place in that department, while with the M.C.C. the professional talent is usually so strong that the amateur who fails in batting and is not a particularly good field has no chance of atoning with the ball. Yet even with the M.C.C. I have occasionally had a gleam of success. Such a one came some years ago, when the team presented me with a little silver hat for getting three consecutive clean-bowled wickets against the Gentlemen of Warwick. One of my victims explained his downfall by assuring me that he had it thoroughly in his head that I was a left-handed bowler, and when the ball came from my right hand he was too bewildered to stop it. The reason is not so good as that of an artist who, when I had bowled him out, exclaimed: \\"Who can play against a man who bowls in a crude pink shirt against an olive-green background?\\" A bowler has many days when everything is against him, when a hard, smooth wicket takes all the spin and devil out of him, when he goes all round and over the wicket, when lofted balls refuse to come to hand, or, if they do come, refuse to stay. But, on the other hand, he has his recompense with many a stroke of good fortune. It was in such a moment that I had the good luck to get the wicket of W. G. Grace, the greatest of all cricketers. W. G. had his speedy revenge. There was nothing more childlike and bland than that slow, tossed-up bowling of his, and nothing more subtle and treacherous. He was always on the wicket or about it, never sent down a really loose ball, worked continually a few inches from the leg, and had a perfect command of length. It was the latter quality which was my downfall. I had made some thirty or forty, and began to relax in the deep respect with which I faced the Doctor's deliveries. I had driven him for four, and jumped out at him again the next ball. Seeing my intention, as a good bowler does, he dropped his ball a foot or two shorter. I reached it with difficulty, but again I scored four. By this time I was very pleased with myself, and could see no reason why every one of these delightful slows should not mean a four to me. Out I danced to reach the next one on the half volley. It was tossed a little higher up in the air, which gave the delusion that it was coming right up to the bat, but as a matter of fact it pitched well short of my reach, broke sharply across and Lilley, the wicket-keeper, had my bails off in a twinkling. One feels rather cheap when one walks from the middle of the pitch to the pavilion, longing to kick oneself for one's own foolishness all the way. I have only once felt smaller, and that was when I was bowled by A. P. Lucas, by the most singular ball that I have ever received. He propelled it like a quoit into the air to a height of at least 30 feet, and it fell straight and true on to the top of the bails. I have often wondered what a good batsman would have made of that ball. To play it one would have needed to turn the blade of the bat straight up, and could hardly fail to give a chance. I tried to cut it off my stumps, with the result that I knocked down my wicket and broke my bat, while the ball fell in the midst of this general chaos. I spent the rest of the day wondering gloomily what I ought to have done—and I am wondering yet. I have had two unusual experiences upon Lord's ground. One was that I got a century in the very first match that I played there. It was an unimportant game, it is true, but still the surprising fact remained. It was a heavy day, and my bat, still encrusted with the classic mud, hangs as a treasured relic in my hall. The other was less pleasant and even more surprising. I was playing for the Club against Kent, and faced for the first time Bradley, who was that year one of the fastest bowlers in England. His first delivery I hardly saw, and it landed with a terrific thud upon my thigh. A little occasional pain is one of the chances of cricket, and one takes it as cheerfully as one can, but on this occasion it suddenly became sharp to an unbearable degree. I clapped my hand to the spot, and found to my amazement that I was on fire. The ball had landed straight on a small tin vesta box in my trousers pocket, had splintered the box, and set the matches ablaze. It did not take me long to turn out my pocket and scatter the burning vestas over the grass. I should have thought this incident unique, but Alec Hearne, to whom I told it, assured me that he had seen more than one accident of the kind. W. G. was greatly amused. \\"Couldn't get you out—had to set you on fire!\\" he cried, in the high voice which seemed so queer from so big a body. There are certain matches which stand out in one's memory for their peculiar surroundings. One was a match played against Cape de Verde at that island on the way to South Africa. There is an Atlantic telegraph station there with a large staff, and they turn out an excellent eleven. I understand that they played each transport as it passed, and that they had defeated all, including the Guards. We made up a very fair team, however, under the captaincy of Lord Henry Scott, and after a hard fight we defeated the islanders. I don't know how many of our eleven left their bones in South Africa; three at least—Blasson, Douglas Forbes (who made our top score), and young Maxwell Craig never returned. I remember one even more tragic match in which I played for the Incogniti against Aldershot Division a few months before the African War. The regiments quartered there were those which afterwards saw the hardest service. Major Ray, who made the top score, was killed at Magersfontein. Young Stanley, who went in first with me, met his death in the Yeomanry. Taking the two teams right through, I am sure that half the men were killed or wounded within two years. How little we could have foreseen it that sunny summer day! It is dangerous when an old cricketer begins to reminisce, because so much comes back to his mind. He has but to smell the hot rubber of a bat handle to be flooded with memories. They are not always glorious. I remember three ladies coming to see me play against one of the Bedford schools. The boys politely applauded as I approached the wicket. A very small boy lobbed up the first ball which I played at. It went up into the air, and was caught at point by the very smallest boy I have ever seen in decent cricket. It seemed to me about a mile as I walked back from the wicket to the pavilion. I don't think those three ladies ever recovered their confidence in my cricketing powers. As a set-off to this confession of failure let me add a small instance of success, where by \\"taking thought\\" I saved a minor international match. It was at the Hague in 1892, and the game was a wandering British team against Holland. The Dutch were an excellent sporting lot, and had one remarkable bowler in Posthuma, a left-hander, who had so huge a break with his slow ball that it was not uncommon for him to pitch the ball right outside the matting on which we played and yet bring it on to the wicket. We won our various local matches without much difficulty, but we were aware that we should have a stiff fight with United Holland, the more so as Dutch hospitality was almost as dangerous to our play as Dutch cricket. So it proved, and we were in the position that with four wickets in hand they had only fifteen runs to make with two batsmen well set. I had not bowled during the tour, for as we were a scratch team, mostly from the schoolmaster class, we did not know each other's capacity. Seeing, however, that things were getting desperate, I went the length of asking our skipper to give me a chance. I had observed that the batsmen had been very well taught by their English professional, and that they all played in most orthodox fashion with a perfectly straight bat. That was why I thought I might get them out. I brought every fielder round to the off, for I felt that they would not think it correct to pull, and I tossed up good length balls about a foot on the off side. It came off exactly as I expected. The pro. had not told them what to do with that particular sort of tosh, and the four men were all caught for as many runs by mid-off or cover. The team in their exultation proceeded to carry me into the pavilion, but whether it was my sixteen stone or the heat of the weather, they tired of the job midway and let me down with a crash which shook the breath out of me—so Holland was avenged. I played against them again when they came to England, and made sixty-seven, but got no wickets, for they had mastered the off-side theory. Some of my quaintest cricket reminiscences are in connection with J. M. Barrie's team—the \\"Allah-Akbarries,\\" or \\"Lord help us\\" as we were called. We played in the old style, caring little about the game and a good deal about a jolly time and pleasant scenery. Broadway, the country home of Mr. Navarro and his wife, formerly Mary Anderson, the famous actress, was one of our favourite haunts, and for several years in succession we played the Artists there. Bernard Partridge, Barrie, A. E. W. Mason, Abbey the Academician, Blomfield the architect, Marriott Watson, Charles Whibley, and others of note took part, and there were many whimsical happenings, which were good fun if they were not good cricket. I thought all record of our games had faded from human ken, but lately a controversy was raised over Mr. Armstrong, the Australian captain, bowling the same man from opposite ends on consecutive overs. This led to the following paragraph in a Birmingham paper, which, I may say, entirely exaggerates my powers but is otherwise correct. \\"BARRIE AND ARMSTRONG. \\"I am not surprised that in the matter of Mr. Armstrong's conduct in bowling two consecutive overs from different ends, no reference has been made to the important precedent which on a similar occasion Sir James Barrie failed to establish (writes a correspondent of the 'Nation'). The occasion was his captaincy (at Broadway, in Worcestershire) of an eleven of writers against a strong team of alleged artists. The circumstances were these. One side had compiled seventy-two runs, chiefly, if not wholly, contributed by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. \\"The sun-worshippers had thereupon responded with an equal number of runs for the loss of all but their last wicket. The ninth wicket had fallen to the last ball of Sir Arthur's over, the other eight having succumbed to the same performer, then in his prime. Actuated, apparently, by the belief that Sir Arthur was the only bowler of his side capable of taking or reaching a wicket, even in Worcestershire, Sir James thereupon put him on at the opposite end. \\"Before, however, he could take a practice ball, a shout was heard from the artists' pavilion, and the nine unengaged players were seen issuing from it to contest our captain's decision. After an exciting contest, it was ultimately given in their favour, with the result that the first ball of the new bowler was hit for two, assisted by overthrows, and the innings and match were won by the artists.\\" Of Barrie's team I remember that it was printed at the bottom of our cards that the practice ground was in the \\"National Observer\\" Office. Mr. Abbey, the famous artist, usually captained against Barrie, and it was part of the agreement that each should have a full pitch to leg just to start his score. I remember my horror when by mistake I bowled a straight first ball to Abbey, and so broke the unwritten law as well as the wicket. Abbey knew nothing of the game, but Barrie was no novice. He bowled an insidious left-hand good length ball coming from leg which was always likely to get a wicket. Talking of bowling, I have twice performed the rare feat of getting all ten wickets. Once it was against a London Club, and once I ran through the side of a Dragoon Regiment at Norwich. My best performance at Lords was seven wickets for fifty-one against Cambridgeshire in 1904. Of fencing my experience has been limited, and yet I have seen enough to realize what a splendid toughening exercise it is. I nearly had an ugly mishap when practising it. I had visited a medical man in Southsea who was an expert with the foils, and at his invitation had a bout with him. I had put on the mask and glove, but was loath to have the trouble of fastening on the heavy chest plastron. He insisted, however, and his insistence saved me from an awkward wound, for, coming in heavily upon a thrust, his foil broke a few inches from the end, and the sharp point thus created went deeply into the pad which covered me. I learned a lesson that day. On the whole, considering the amount of varied sport which I have done, I have come off very well as regards bodily injury. One finger broken at football, two at cricket (one after the other in the same season), the disablement of my knee—that almost exhausts it. Though a heavy man and quite an indifferent rider, I have never hurt myself in a fair selection of falls in the hunting field and elsewhere. Once, as I have narrated, when I was down, the horse kicked me over the eye with his forefoot, but I got off with a rather ragged wound, though it might have been very much more serious. Indeed, when it comes to escapes, I have had more than my share of luck. One of the worst was in a motor accident, when the machine, which weighed over a ton, ran up a high bank, threw me out on a gravel drive below, and then, turning over, fell upon the top of me. The steering wheel projected slightly from the rest, and thus broke the impact and undoubtedly saved my life, but it gave way under the strain, and the weight of the car settled across my spine just below the neck, pinning my face down on the gravel, and pressing with such terrific force as to make it impossible to utter a sound. I felt the weight getting heavier moment by moment, and wondered how long my vertebrae could stand it. However, they did so long enough to enable a crowd to collect and the car to be levered off me. I should think there are few who can say that they have held up a ton weight across their spine and lived unparalyzed to talk about it. It is an acrobatic feat which I have no desire to repeat. There is plenty of sport in driving one's own motor and meeting the hundred and one unexpected roadside adventures and difficulties which are continually arising. These were greater a few years ago, when motors were themselves less solidly and accurately constructed, drivers were less skilled, and frightened horses were more in evidence. No invention of modern civilization has done so much for developing a man's power of resource and judgment as the motor. To meet and overcome a sudden emergency is the best of human training, and if a man is his own driver and mechanician on a fairly long journey he can hardly fail to have some experience of it. I well remember in the early days of motoring going up to Birmingham to take delivery of my new 12 horse-power Wolseley. I had invested in the sort of peaked yachting cap which was considered the correct badge of the motorist in those days, but as I paced the plat-form of New Street Station a woman removed any conceit I might have over my headgear, by asking me peremptorily how the trains ran to Walsall. She took me for one of the officials. I got the car safely home, and no doubt it was a good car as things went at that time, but the secret of safe brakes had not yet been discovered, and my pair used to break as if they were glass. More than once I have known what it is to steer a car when it is flying backwards under no control down a winding hill. Looking back at those days it seems to me that I was under the car nearly as much as on the top of it, for every repair had to be done from below. There were few accidents from smashing my differential, seizing my engines, and stripping my gears, which I have not endured. It was a chain-driven machine, and I can well remember one absurd incident when the chain jumped the cogs and fell off. We were on a long slope of 3 miles and ran on with the engine turned off quite unconscious of what had occurred. When we reached level ground the car naturally stopped, and we got out, opened the bonnet, tested the electricity, and were utterly puzzled as to what was amiss, when a yokel in a cart arrived waving our motive power over his head. He had picked it up on the road. Our descendants will never realize the terror of the horses at this innovation, nor the absurd scenes which it caused. On one occasion I was motoring down a narrow lane in Norfolk, with my mother in the open tonneau. Coming round a curve we came upon two carts, one behind the other. The leading horse, which had apparently never seen a motor before, propped his forelegs out, his ears shot forward, his eyes stared rigidly and then in a moment he whirled round, ran up the bank, and tried to escape behind his comrade. This he could have done but for the cart, which he also dragged up the bank. Horse and cart fell sideways on the other horse and cart, and there was such a mixture that you could not disentangle it. The carts were full of turnips and these formed a top dressing over the interlaced shafts and the struggling horses. I sprang out and was trying to help the enraged farmer to get something right end up, when I glanced at my own car which was almost involved in the pile. There was my dear old mother sitting calmly knitting in the midst of all the chaos. It was really like something in a dream. My most remarkable motor car experience was when I drove my own 16 horse-power Dietrich-Lorraine in the International Road Competition organized by Prince Henry of Prussia in 1911. This affair is discussed later, when I come to the preludes of war. I came away from it with sinister forebodings. The impression left on my mind by the whole incident is shown by the fact that one of the first things I did when I got to London was to recommend a firm of which I am director to remove a large sum which it had lying in Berlin. I have no doubt that it would have continued to lie there and that we might have lost it. As to the contest itself it ended in a British victory, which was owing to the staunch way in which we helped each other when in difficulties, while the Germans were more a crowd of individuals than a team. Their cars were excellent and so was their driving. My own little car did very well and only dropped marks at Sutton Bank in Yorkshire, that terrible hill, one in three at one point, with a hair-pin bend. When we finally panted out our strength I put my light-weight chauffeur to the wheel, ran round, and fairly boosted her up from behind, but we were fined so many marks for my leaving the driving wheel. Not to get up would have meant three times the forfeit, so my tactics were well justified. No doubt the coming science of aviation will develop the same qualities as motor driving to an even higher degree. It Is a form of sport in which I have only aspirations and little experience. I had one balloon ascent in which we covered some 25 miles and ascended 6,000 feet, which was so delightful an expedition that I have always been eager for another and a longer one. A man has a natural trepidation the first time he leaves the ground, but I remember that, as I stood by the basket with the gas-bag swinging about above me and the assistants clinging to the ropes, some one pointed out an elderly gentleman and said: \\"That is the famous Mr. So-and-So, the aeronaut.\\" I saw a venerable person and I asked how many ascents he had made. \\"About a thousand,\\" was the answer. No eloquence or reasoning could have convinced me so completely that I might get into the basket with a cheerful mind, though I will admit that for the first minute or so one feels very strange, and keeps an uncommonly tight grip of the side-ropes. This soon passes, however, and one is lost in the wonder of the prospect and the glorious feeling of freedom and detachment. As in a ship, it is the moment of nearing land once more which is the moment of danger—or, at least, of discomfort; but beyond a bump or two, we came to rest very quietly in the heart of a Kentish hop-field. I had one aeroplane excursion in rather early days, but the experience was not entirely a pleasant one. Machines were under-engined in those days and very much at the mercy of the wind. We went up at Hendon—May 25, 1911, the date—but the machine was a heavy bi-plane, and though it went down wind like a swallow it was more serious when we turned and found, looking down, that the objects below us were stationary or even inclined to drift backwards. However, we got back to the field at last, and I think the pilot was as relieved as I. What impressed me most was the terrible racket of the propeller, comparing so unfavourably with the delicious calm of the balloon journey. There is one form of sport in which I have, I think, been able to do some practical good, for I can claim to have been the first to introduce skis into the Grisons division of Switzerland, or at least to demonstrate their practical utility as a means of getting across in winter from one valley to another. It was in 1894 that I read Nansen's account of his crossing of Greenland, and thus became interested in the subject of ski-ing. It chanced that I was compelled to spend that winter in the Davos valley, and I spoke about the matter to Tobias Branger, a sporting tradesman in the village, who in turn interested his brother. We sent for skis from Norway, and for some weeks afforded innocent amusement to a large number of people who watched our awkward movements and complex tumbles. The Brangers made much better progress than I. At the end of a month or so we felt that we were getting more expert, and determined to climb the Jacobshorn, a considerable hill just opposite the Davos Hotel. We had to carry our unwieldy skis upon our backs until we had passed the fir trees which line its slopes, but once in the open we made splendid progress, and had the satisfaction of seeing the flags in the village dipped in our honour when we reached the summit. But it was only in returning that we got the full flavour of ski-ing. In ascending you shuffle up by long zigzags, the only advantage of your footgear being that it is carrying you over snow which would engulf you without it. But coming back you simply turn your long toes and let yourself go, gliding delightfully over the gentle slopes, flying down the steeper ones, taking an occasional cropper, but getting as near to flying as any earth-bound man can. In that glorious air it is a delightful experience. Encouraged by our success with the Jacobshorn, we determined to show the utility of our accomplishment by opening up communications with Arosa, which lies in a parallel valley and can only be reached in winter by a very long and roundabout railway journey. To do this we had to cross a high pass, and then drop down on the other side. It was a most interesting journey, and we felt all the pride of pioneers as we arrived in Arosa. I have no doubt that what we did would seem absurdly simple to Norwegians or others who were apt at the game, but we had to find things out for ourselves and it was sometimes rather terrifying. The sun had not yet softened the snow on one sharp slope across which we had to go, and we had to stamp with our skis in order to get any foothold. On our left the snow slope ended in a chasm from which a blue smoke or fog rose in the morning air. I hardly dared look in that direction, but from the corner of my eye I saw the vapour of the abyss. I stamped along and the two gallant Switzers got on my left, so that if I slipped the shock would come upon them. We had no rope by which we could link up. We got across all right and perhaps we exaggerated the danger, but it was not a pleasant experience. Then I remember that we came to an absolute precipice, up which no doubt the path zig-zags in summer. It was not of course perpendicular, but it seemed little removed from it, and it had just slope enough to hold the snow. It looked impassable, but the Brangers had picked up a lot in some way of their own. They took off their skis, fastened them together with a thong, and on this toboggan they sat, pushing themselves over the edge, and going down amid a tremendous spray of flying snow. When they had reached safety they beckoned to me to follow. I had done as they did, and was sitting on my ski preparatory to launching myself when a fearsome thing happened, for my ski shot from under me, flew down the slope, and vanished in huge bounds among the snow mounds beyond. It was a nasty moment, and the poor Brangers stood looking up at me some hundreds of feet below me in a dismal state of mind. However, there was no possible choice as to what to do, so I did it. I let myself go over the edge, and came squattering down, with legs and arms extended to check the momentum. A minute later I was rolling covered with snow at the feet of my guides, and my skis were found some hundreds of yards away, so no harm was done after all. I remember that when we signed the hotel register Tobias Branger filled up the space after my name, in which the new arrival had to describe his profession, by the word \\"Sportesmann,\\" which I took as a compliment. It was at any rate more pleasant than the German description of my golf clubs, which went astray on the railway and turned up at last with the official description of \\"Kinderspieler\\" (child's toys) attached to them. To return to the skis they are no doubt in very general use, but I think I am right in saying that these and other excursions of ours first demonstrated their possibilities to the people of the country and have certainly sent a good many thousands of pounds since then into Switzerland. If my rather rambling career in sport has been of any practical value to any one, it is probably in this matter, and also, perhaps, in the opening up of miniature rifle-ranges in 1901, when the idea was young in this country, and when my Hindhead range was the pioneer and the model for many others. A pleasing souvenir of my work on Rifle Clubs is to be found in the Conan Doyle Cup, which was presented by my friend Sir John Langman, and is still shot for every year at Bisley by civilian teams. On the whole as I look back there is no regret in my mind for the time that I have devoted to sport. It gives health and strength, but above all it gives a certain balance of mind without which a man is not complete. To give and to take, to accept success modestly and defeat bravely, to fight against odds, to stick to one's point, to give credit to your enemy and value your friend—these are some of the lessons which true sport should impart.","completion":"Con George Meredith tuve varias conexiones interesantes. Tengo la mayor admiración posible por él en su mejor momento, mientras que su peor aspecto es tal impedimento que creo que arrastrará cuatro quintas partes de su obra al olvido. Si su propia generación lo encuentra difícil de entender, ¿qué pensarán nuestros descendientes de él? Será un culto entre unos pocos, muy valiosos en todo sentido. Y sin embargo, reconozco plenamente que fue la mente más activa y original y la pluma más ingeniosa de cualquier hombre, novelista o de otra índole, de mi tiempo. Sabiendo esto bien, es extraño que pueda ver un futuro tan limitado para él. Su mente sutil y compleja parecía incapaz de comprender la posición de los simples forasteros que representan al mundo. No podía ver cómo su vidriera empañada podría ser menos efectiva que la sustancia transparente simple como medio para la visión. El primer requisito es ser inteligible. El segundo es ser interesante. El tercero es ser ingenioso. Meredith llenó enormemente el tercero, pero fue desigual en los otros dos. Por ello, nunca estará, a pesar de las glorias de \\"Richard Feverel\\", a la par con Dickens o Thackeray, quienes cumplieron los tres. Simplemente no tenía idea de cómo sus palabras impactarían en una mente menos compleja. Recuerdo que una vez, en presencia de Barrie, Quiller-Couch y yo, leyó un poema que había inscrito \\"Al Trabajador Británico\\" en la \\"Westminster Gazette\\". No sé qué pensó el trabajador británico de él, pero estoy seguro de que nosotros tres nos quedamos muy desconcertados sobre de qué se trataba. Había escrito algunos artículos sobre su obra, que había sido uno de mis cultos juveniles, y eso llevó a que me invitara a verlo en su villa en Box Hill, la primera de varias visitas de ese tipo. Había habido bastante en los periódicos sobre su salud, así que me sorprendió cuando, al abrir la puerta del jardín, un caballero ligero pero robusto con un traje gris y una corbata roja salió por la puerta del vestíbulo y bajó cantando en voz alta por el camino. Supongo que estaba cerca de los setenta en ese momento, pero se veía más joven, y su rostro artístico era agradable a la vista. Al saludarme, señaló una colina empinada detrás de la casa y dijo: \\"Acabo de subir hasta la cima a caminar\\". Miré la pendiente pronunciada y dije: \\"Debes estar en buena forma para hacerlo\\". Se veía enojado y dijo: \\"Ese sería un cumplido apropiado para un octogenario\\". Me molestó un poco su susceptibilidad, así que respondí: \\"Pensé que estaba hablando con un inválido\\". Realmente parecía que mi visita terminaría en la puerta del jardín, pero finalmente se calmó, y pronto nos hicimos bastante amigos. Había sido en su juventud un connoisseur de vinos, y todavía tenía un gran respeto por un buen vino añejo, pero desafortunadamente algún trastorno nervioso del que sufría había causado que los médicos se lo prohibieran absolutamente. Cuando llegó la hora del almuerzo, me preguntó con un aire muy serio si podría comprometerme a beber una botella entera de Borgoña. Respondí que no veía ninguna dificultad insuperable. Una vieja botella polvorienta fue cuidadosamente llevada a la mesa, la cual consumí, mientras Meredith observaba con interés cómo la despachaba. \\"De hecho\\", dijo, \\"amo mi vino, y mi pequeña bodega fue creada con cuidado y juicio, por lo que cuando algún invitado viene y bebe un vaso y desperdicia el resto de la botella, me duele el corazón. Realmente me hizo bien verte disfrutar de esa\\". No hace falta decir que insinué que siempre estaba dispuesto a complacer. Su conversación era extraordinariamente vívida y dramática, expresada en un tono más vehemente. Podría haber sido artificial y podría haber sido actuación, pero era muy llamativa y entretenida. La conversación se centró en los mariscales de Napoleón, y uno habría pensado que los conocía íntimamente, e hizo la indignación de Murat de ser ordenado a cargar al frente, como si hubiera cargado de otra manera, de forma que habría hecho las delicias de la audiencia. De vez en cuando sacaba a relucir una frase a lo Meredith que sonaba cómica cuando se aplicaba a asuntos domésticos. Cuando la gelatina se balanceaba en la mesa mientras la sirvienta la ponía, dijo: \\"La gelatina, Mary, es tan traicionera como el Caballo de Troya\\". Se rió cuando le conté cómo mi mayordomo, reclutado como camarero para una cena especial, había dicho: \\"¡Cuidado ahí!\\" a la gelatina en circunstancias similares. Después del almuerzo caminamos por un camino empinado hacia la pequeña cabaña o casa de verano donde solía escribir. Quería leerme una novela que había comenzado veinte años antes, pero que no había tenido ánimo de continuar. Me gustó mucho, y nos reímos a carcajadas de su descripción de un viejo lobo de mar que subía el cuello de su abrigo cuando entraba en acción como si las balas fueran lluvia. Dijo que mi entusiasmo al disfrutarla le animó a continuarla, y desde entonces ha aparecido como \\"El Asombroso Matrimonio\\", pero si realmente tuve algo que ver con eso no lo sé. Estaría orgulloso de pensarlo. El trastorno nervioso de Meredith causaba que cayera ocasionalmente. Mientras caminábamos por el estrecho camino hacia la cabaña, escuché su caída detrás de mí, pero juzgué por el sonido que era una mera resbaladura y que no pudo haberle dolido. Por lo tanto, seguí caminando como si no hubiera escuchado nada. Era un viejo orgulloso, y mis instintos me decían que su humillación al ser ayudado a levantarse sería mucho mayor que cualquier alivio que pudiera darle. Ciertamente era un buen punto a decidir. Las convicciones religiosas de George Meredith eran muy difíciles de decidir. Ciertamente no tenía ni el más mínimo presentimiento de ningún elemento psíquico en la vida, y supongo que en general compartía las opiniones de su amigo, John Morley, que eran completamente negativas. Y sin embargo, recuerdo que me aseguró que la oración era algo muy necesario y que uno nunca debería abandonar la oración. \\"El que se levanta de la oración como un hombre mejor, su oración es concedida\\", dice el Aforista en \\"Richard Feverel\\". Hasta qué punto se pueden armonizar estas posiciones, no lo sé. Supongo que uno puede decir que Dios es desconocido y, sin embargo, erigir un templo mental al Dios desconocido. Rudyard Kipling lo conozco mucho menos de lo que debería, considerando cuánto admiro sus escritos y que vivimos en el mismo condado; pero ambos estamos absortos en el trabajo y ambos nos ausentamos mucho de casa, lo que puede explicarlo. Recuerdo bien lo ansioso que compré su primer libro, \\"Cuentos Llanos\\", en los viejos días de Southsea, cuando comprar un libro era una tensión rara sobre mi presupuesto. Lo leí con deleite y me di cuenta no solo de que había surgido una nueva fuerza en la literatura, sino que había aparecido un nuevo método de escribir historias que era muy diferente de mi propia adherencia a la trama cuidadosamente desarrollada. Este era un trabajo a voluntad, para tomarlo o dejarlo, que de repente se encendía en una frase o párrafo incandescente, lo que era más efectivo por su llegada repentina. En forma, sus historias eran crudas, y sin embargo, en efecto, que es todo, eran magníficas. Me mostró que los métodos no podían estereotiparse y que había un camino más excelente, incluso si estaba fuera de mi alcance. También me encantaban las \\"Baladas de los Cuarteles\\" y poemas como \\"El Bolívar\\", \\"Este y Oeste\\" y, sobre todo, el mal nombrado \\"Envoi\\" se convirtieron en parte de mi ser. Siempre leo el último en voz alta a mi pequeño círculo antes de comenzar cualquier nueva expedición, porque contiene la esencia misma del viaje, el romance y la gran aventura. Vi a Kipling más de cerca en sus primeros días cuando vivía en Brattleboro, una pequeña aldea de Vermont, en un deseo caballeroso de mantener a su recién casada esposa en contacto con su propio círculo. En 1894, como he registrado, había bastantes retorcimientos de cola en los Estados Unidos, y Kipling arrancó algunas plumas de la cola del Águila en represalia, lo que provocó muchos gritos de protesta, ya que el estadounidense era mucho más sensible a tales cosas que el británico curtido. Digo \\"era\\", porque creo que como nación, con una mayor seguridad de su propio valor y fortaleza, ahora son más despreocupados por la crítica. El resultado en ese momento fue agregar aceite a las llamas, y yo, como un creyente apasionado en la unión angloamericana, escribí a Kipling para protestar. Recibió mi protesta de muy buen humor y eso llevó a mi visita a su hogar en el campo. De hecho, la preocupación mostrada en Estados Unidos, cuando el poeta estuvo a punto de morir unos años después, mostró que el rencor no era muy profundo. Tal vez era más conocido en ese momento en Estados Unidos que en Inglaterra, porque recuerdo estar sentado al lado de un conductor de autobús en Londres, quien inclinó su rostro rojo hacia mi oído y dijo: \\"Perdone, señor, pero ¿quién es este Kilpin?\\" Tuve dos grandes días en Vermont, y tengo un agradecido recuerdo de la hospitalidad de la señora Kipling. El poeta me leyó \\"El Himno de McAndrew\\", que acababa de hacer, y me sorprendió por su poder dramático que le permitió mantener el acento de Glasgow a lo largo, de modo que el tosco mecánico escocés simplemente caminó por la habitación. Había llevado mis palos de golf y le di lecciones en un campo mientras los rústicos de Nueva Inglaterra nos observaban desde lejos, preguntándose qué diablos estábamos haciendo, ya que el golf era desconocido en Estados Unidos en ese momento. Nos separamos como buenos amigos, y la visita fue un oasis en mi peregrinaje bastante sombrío como conferenciante. Mis vislumbres de Kipling desde entonces han sido pocas y esparcidas, pero tuve el placer varias veces de conocer a su anciano padre, una persona encantadora y adorable, que contaba una historia tan bien como su famoso hijo. Como la madre también era una mujer muy notable, no es de extrañar que cargara con tanto equipaje. James Barrie es uno de mis amigos literarios más antiguos, y lo conocí dentro de uno o dos años desde que ambos llegamos a Londres. Acababa de escribir su \\"Ventana en Thrums\\", y yo, como todo el mundo, lo aclamé. Cuando estaba dando conferencias en Escocia en 1893, me invitó a Kirriemuir, donde pasé varios días con su familia, espléndidos ejemplos de la gente que ha hecho grande a Escocia. Su padre era un tipo excelente, pero su madre era maravillosa con una cabeza y un corazón, combinaciones raras, que me hicieron clasificarla con mi propia madre. Kirriemuir no podía entender en absoluto el éxito de Barrie y consideraba a su gran hijo como un fenómeno inexplicable. Sin embargo, eran muy conscientes de que los turistas estaban llegando de todas partes para ver el lugar debido a los libros de Barrie. \\"Supongo que los has leído\\", le dije a la esposa del dueño del hotel local. \\"Sí, los he leído, y fue un trabajo duro y agotador\\", dijo ella. Tenía alguna teoría de que era un carruaje tirado por cuatro caballos lo que su buen hombre estaba manejando, y no los libros en absoluto lo que explicaba el auge. Tan grandes como son las obras de Barrie, y algunas de ellas creo que son muy grandes, desearía que nunca hubiera escrito una línea para el teatro. El glamour de esto y el éxito, para él, fácil han desviado de la literatura al hombre con el estilo más puro de su época. Las obras de teatro siempre son efímeras, por muy buenas que sean, y están limitadas a unos pocos, pero los libros no nacidos de Barrie podrían haber sido un activo eterno y universal de la literatura británica. Tiene la claridad casta que es el gran estilo, el cual ha sido rebajado por una generación de críticos miserables que siempre han confundido lo que es claro con lo que es superficial, y lo que es turbio con lo que es profundo. Si el pensamiento de un hombre es preciso, su expresión de ello es precisa, y los pensamientos turbios hacen párrafos oscuros. Si tuviera que elegir entre los estilistas modernos, elegiría a Barrie para las formas de expresión más ligeras y a nuestro británico Winston Churchill para las más clásicas. La gran obra de Barrie, una de las mejores en el idioma, es por supuesto \\"El Admirable Crichton\\". Siempre espero que haya tenido una mano en su elaboración. Digo esto no en queja sino en satisfacción, porque todos dejamos caer semillas entre nosotros y rara vez sabemos de dónde vienen. Caminábamos juntos por el brezal en Kirriemuir cuando le dije: \\"Tuve un pensamiento pintoresco en la noche, Barrie. Fue que un rey estaba visitando la India y naufragó en el camino en alguna isla lejos de la ruta de los barcos. Solo él y un marinero bastante hábil se salvaron. Se establecieron para pasar sus vidas juntos. Por supuesto, el resultado sería que el marinero se convertiría en el rey y el rey en el súbdito\\". Nos reímos de la idea, y cuando apareció Crichton, parecía ver la fina planta que había crecido de la diminuta semilla. Barrie y yo tuvimos una aventura desafortunada juntos, en la que puedo decir que la desgracia fue principalmente mía, ya que realmente no tuve nada que ver con el asunto, y sin embargo compartí todos los problemas. Sin embargo, habría compartido el honor y el beneficio en caso de éxito, por lo que no tengo derecho a quejarme. Los hechos fueron que Barrie había prometido al Sr. D'Oyley Carte que proporcionaría el libreto de una opereta ligera para el Savoy. Eran los días de Gilbert, cuando tal libreto era juzgado por un estándar muy alto. Fue una comisión extraordinaria para él aceptar, y nunca he podido entender por qué lo hizo, a menos que, como Alejandro, quisiera conquistar nuevos mundos. En esta ocasión, sin embargo, sufrió un terrible revés, y la opereta, \\"Jane Annie\\", a la que aludí en un capítulo anterior, fue uno de los pocos fracasos en su brillante carrera. Fui involucrado en el asunto porque la salud de Barrie se vio afectada por el duelo familiar. Recibí un telegrama urgente de él en Aldburgh y, al llegar allí, lo encontré muy preocupado porque se había comprometido con este contrato y se sentía incapaz de seguir adelante en su estado actual. Habría dos actos, y había escrito el primero y tenía el escenario aproximado del segundo, con la secuencia completa de eventos, si es que se puede llamar así a una secuencia. ¿Vendría yo para ayudarlo a completarla como coautor? Por supuesto, estaba muy feliz de servirle de cualquier manera. Sin embargo, mi corazón se hundió cuando, después de dar la promesa, examiné el trabajo. El único don literario que Barrie no tenía era el sentido del ritmo poético y el instinto de lo que es permisible en verso. Había ideas y agudeza en abundancia. Pero la trama en sí misma no era fuerte, aunque el diálogo y las situaciones también eran ocasionalmente excelentes. Hice lo mejor que pude y escribí las letras para el segundo acto y gran parte del diálogo, pero tuvo que tomar la forma predestinada. El resultado no fue bueno. Sin embargo, la camaradería real de la producción fue muy divertida e interesante, y nuestro fracaso fue principalmente doloroso para nosotros porque decepcionamos al productor y al reparto. Fuimos muy criticados por los críticos, pero Barrie lo tomó todo con el espíritu más valiente."},{"prompt":"Traduce -> I was brought into the matter because Barrie's health failed on account of some family bereavement. I had an urgent telegram from him at Aldburgh, and going there I found him very worried because he had bound himself by this contract, and he felt in his present state unable to go forward with it. There were to be two acts, and he had written the first one, and had the rough scenario of the second, with the complete sequence of events—if one may call it a sequence. Would I come in with him and help him to complete it as part author? Of course I was very happy to serve him in any way. My heart sank, however, when, after giving the promise, I examined the work. The only literary gift which Barrie has not got is the sense of poetic rhythm, and the instinct for what is permissible in verse. Ideas and wit were there in abundance. But the plot itself was not strong, though the dialogue and the situations also were occasionally excellent. I did my best and wrote the lyrics for the second act, and much of the dialogue, but it had to take the predestined shape. The result was not good. However, the actual comradeship of production was very amusing and interesting, and our failure was mainly painful to us because it let down the producer and the cast. We were well abused by the critics, but Barrie took it all in the bravest spirit. I find, in looking over my papers, a belated statement of account from Barrie which is good reading. IN ACCOUNT WITH J. M. BARRIE Why. Cause of delay. Remarks. A £1 Lent at Station. Object moving too fast. Doyle says he lent it. B £12 Jane Annie on Tour. Moving or swaying of Kodak. Better late than never. C £30 6s. 4d, Heaven knows. Failure to pull cord. Doyle gets 2/5 of a penny beyond his share. Our association was never so closely renewed, but through all my changing life I have had a respect and affection for Barrie which were, I hope, mutual. How I collaborated with him at cricket as well as at work is told in my chapter on Sport. Henry Irving is one of the other great men whom I have met at close quarters, for his acting of Gregory Brewster brought us in contact. When he was producing \\"Coriolanus\\" he came down to Hindhead and used to drop in of an evening. He was fond of a glass of port—indeed, he was one of the four great men who were stated (probably untruly) by the Hon. G. Russell to drink a bottle each night—being the only trait which these great men had in common. The others, I remember, were Tennyson, Gladstone and Moses Montefiori, and the last I believe was really true. Like all bad habits, it overtook the sinner at last, and he was cut off at the age of 116. Irving had a curious dry wit which was occasionally sardonic and ill-natured. I can well believe that his rehearsals were often the occasion for heart-burnings among the men and tears among the ladies. The unexpectedness of his remarks took one aback. I remember when my friend Hamilton sat up with me into the \\"wee sma' hours\\" with the famous man, he became rather didactic on the subject of the Deity or the Universe or some other tremendous topic, which he treated very solemnly, and at great length. Irving sat with his intense eyes riveted upon the speaker's face, which encouraged Hamilton to go on and on. When at last he had finished, Irving remarked: \\"What a low comedian you would have made!\\" He wound up his visit by giving me his copy of \\"Coriolanus\\" with all his notes and stage directions—a very precious relic. Many visions of old times rise before my eyes as I write, but my book would lose all proportion should I dwell upon them. I see Henley, the formidable cripple, a red-bearded, loud-voiced buccaneer of a man who could only crawl, for his back appeared to be broken. He was a great poet and critic who seemed to belong to the roaring days of Marlowe of the mighty line and the pothouse fray. I see Haggard too, first as the young spruce diplomatist, later as the worn and bearded man with strange vague tendencies to mysticism. Shaw, too, I see with the pleasant silky voice and the biting phrase. It was strange that all the mild vegetables which formed his diet made him more pugnacious and, I must add, more uncharitable than the carnivorous man, so that I have known no literary man who was more ruthless to other people's feelings. And yet to meet him was always to like him. He could not resist a bitter jest or the perverted pleasure of taking up an unpopular attitude. As an example I remember Henry Irving telling me that when Shaw was invited to his father's funeral he wrote in reply: \\"If I were at Westminster Henry Irving would turn in his grave, just as Shakespeare would turn in his grave were Henry Irving at Stratford.\\" I may not have it verbally exact, but that was near enough. It was the kind of outrageous thing that he would say. And yet one can forgive him all when one reads the glorious dialogue of some of his plays. He seems subhuman in emotion and superhuman in intellect. Shaw was always a thorn in Irving's side, and was usually the one jarring note among the chorus of praise which greeted each fresh production. At a first night at the Lyceum—those wonderful first nights which have never been equalled—the lanky Irishman with his greenish face, his red beard, and his sardonic expression must have been like the death's-head at the banquet to Irving. Irving ascribed this animosity to Shaw's pique because his plays were not accepted, but in this I am sure that he did an injustice. It was simply that contrary twist in the man which makes him delight in opposing whatever anyone else approved. There is nothing constructive in him, and he is bound to be in perpetual opposition. No one for example was stronger for peace and for non-militarism than he, and I remember that when I took the chair at a meeting at Hindhead to back up the Tsar's peace proposals at The Hague, I thought to myself as I spied Shaw in a corner of the room: \\"Well, this time at any rate he must be in sympathy.\\" But far from being so he sprang to his feet and put forward a number of ingenious reasons why these proposals for peace would be disastrous. Do what you could he was always against you. Perhaps it is no bad thing to have the other point of view continually stated, and the British stand that sort of thing better than other nations. Had Shaw said in America what he said in England about the war whilst it was in progress he would have been in personal danger. There were times, however, when his queer contrary impulses became perfectly brutal in their working. One was at the time of the Titanic disaster, when he deliberately wrote a letter at a time when the wounds were raw, overwhelming every one concerned with bitter criticism. I was moved to write a remonstrance, and we had a sharp debate in public, which did not in any way modify our kindly personal relations. I can recall a smaller but even more unjustifiable example of his sour nature when he was staying at Hindhead. A garden-party had been got up for some charity, and it included the woodland scenes of \\"As You Like It,\\" which were done by amateurs, and very well done too. Shaw with no provocation wrote a whole column of abuse in the local paper, spattering all the actors and their performance with ridicule, and covering them with confusion, though indeed they had nothing to be ashamed of. One mentions these things as characteristic of one side of the man, and as a proof, I fear, that the adoption by the world of a vegetarian diet will not bring unkind thoughts or actions to an end. But with it all Shaw is a genial creature to meet, and I am pre-pared to believe that there is a human kindly side to his nature though it has not been presented to the public. It took a good man to write \\"Saint Joan.\\" Wells, too, I have known long, and indeed I must have often entered the draper's shop in which he was employed at Southsea, for the proprietor was a patient of mine. Wells is one of the great fruits which popular education has given us, since he came, as he is proud to state, from the heart of the people. His democratic frankness and complete absence of class feeling are occasionally embarrassing. I remember his asking me once if I had played cricket at Liphook. I said that I had. He said: \\"Did you notice an old fellow who acts as professional and ground-keeper?\\" I said that I had. \\"That was my father,\\" said Wells. I was too much surprised to answer, and could only congratulate myself that I had made no unpleasant comments before I knew the identity of the old man. I have always had my doubts as to those elaborate forecasts of the future in which Wells indulges. He has, it is true, made a couple of good shots which have already materialized in the tanks and in the machine which would deliver news in our own houses. But he has never shown any perception of the true meaning of the psychic, and for want of it his history of the world, elaborate and remarkable as it was, seemed to me to be a body without a soul. However, this also may be given him, and it will make his equipment complete. I remember discussing the matter with him, when George Gissing, Hornung, he and I foregathered in Rome early in this century, but apparently my words had no effect. Willie Hornung, my brother-in-law, is another of my vivid memories. He was a Dr. Johnson without the learning but with a finer wit. No one could say a neater thing, and his writings, good as they are, never adequately represented the powers of the man, nor the quickness of his brain. These things depend upon the time and the fashion, and go flat in the telling, but I remember how, when I showed him the record of some one who claimed to have done 100 yards under ten seconds, he said: \\"It is a sprinter's error.\\" Golf he could not abide, for he said it was \\"unsportsmanlike to hit a sitting ball.\\" His criticism upon my Sherlock Holmes was: \\"Though he might be more humble, there is no police like Holmes.\\" I think I may claim that his famous character Raffles was a kind of inversion of Sherlock Holmes, Bunny playing Watson. He admits as much in his kindly dedication. I think there are few finer examples of short-story writing in our language than these, though I confess I think they are rather dangerous in their suggestion. I told him so before he put pen to paper, and the result has, I fear, borne me out. You must not make the criminal a hero. Jerome, too, is an old friend. He is an adventurous soul, and at one time started a four-in-hand. I remember sitting on the top of it, and when one of the leaders turned right round and took a good look at the driver I thought it was time to get down. Maxwell also is an old friend. He is, of course, the son of Miss Braddon, who married a publisher of that name. I respect him for doing a man's work in the war when, though he was fifty years of age, and had led a sedentary life, he volunteered for a fighting battalion, a credit which he shares with A. E. W. Mason. Maxwell's work has always greatly appealed to me, and I have long looked upon him as the greatest novelist that we possess. I never met Robert Louis Stevenson in the flesh, though I owe so much to him in the literary spirit. Never can I forget the delight with which I read those early stories of his in the \\"Cornhill,\\" before I knew the name of the author. I still think that \\"The Pavilion on the Links\\" is one of the great short stories of the world, though there were alterations in the final form which were all for the worse, and showed prudery upon the part of the publishers. Stevenson's last year at Edinburgh University must have just about coincided with my first one, and Barrie must also have been in that grey old nest of learning about the year 1876. Strange to think that I probably brushed elbows with both of them in the crowded portal. From his far-away home in Samoa he seemed to keep a quick eye upon literary matters in England, and I had most encouraging letters from him in 1893 and 1894. \\"O frolic fellow-spookist\\" was his curious term of personal salutation in one of these, which showed that he shared my interest in psychic research but did not take it very seriously. I cannot guess how at that time he had detected it, though I was aware that he had himself in early days acted as secretary to a psychic research or rather to a spiritualist society in Edinburgh, which studied the remarkable mediumship of Duguid. His letters to me consisted of kind appreciation of my work. \\"I have a great talent for compliment,\\" he said, \\"accompanied by a hateful, even a diabolic, frankness.\\" He had been retailing some of my Sherlock Holmes yarns to his native servants—I should not have thought that he needed to draw upon anyone else—and he complained to me in a comical letter of the difficulty of telling a story when you had to halt every moment to explain what a railway was, what an engineer was, and so forth. He got the story across in spite of all difficulties, and, said he, \\"If you could have seen the bright feverish eyes of Simite you would have tasted glory.\\" But he explained that the natives took everything literally, and that there was no such thing as an imaginary story for them. \\"I, who write this, have had the indiscretion to perpetaate a trifling piece of fiction, 'The Bottle Imp. Parties who come up to visit my mansion, after having admired the ceiling by Vanderputty and the tapestry by Gobbling, manifest towards the end a certain uneasiness which proves them to be fellows of an infinite delicacy. They may be seen to shrug a brown shoulder, to roll up a speaking eye, and at last the secret bursts from them: 'Where is the bottle?' \\"In another letter he said that as I had written of my first book in the \\"Idler\\" he also would do so. \\"I could not hold back where the white plume of Conan Doyle waved in front of me.\\" So, at least, I may boast that it is to me that the world owes the little personal sketch about \\"Treasure Island\\" which appeared in that year. I cannot forget the shock that it was to me when driving down the Strand in a hansom cab in 1896 I saw upon a yellow evening poster \\"Death of Stevenson.\\" Some-thing seemed to have passed out of my world. I was asked by his executors to finish the novel \\"St. Ives,\\" which he had left three-quarters completed, but I did not feel equal to the task. It was done, however, and, I understand, very well done, by Quiller-Couch. It is a desperately difficult thing to carry on another man's story, and must be a more or less mechanical effort. I had one experience of it when my neighbour at Hindhead, Grant Allen, was on his death-bed. He was much worried because there were two numbers of his serial, \\"Hilda Wade,\\" which was running in \\"The Strand\\" magazine, still uncompleted. It was a pleasure for me to do them for him, and so relieve his mind, but it was difficult collar work, and I expect they were pretty bad. Some time afterwards a stranger, who evidently confused Allen and me, wrote to say that his wife had given him a baby girl, and that in honour of me he was calling her Hilda Wade. He was really nearer the truth than appeared at first sight. I well remember that death-bed of Grant Allen's. He was an agnostic of a type which came very near atheism, though in his private life an amiable and benevolent man. Believing what he did, the approach of death must have offered rather a bleak prospect, and as he had paroxysms of extreme pain the poor fellow seemed very miserable. I had often argued the case with him, I from a Theistic and he from a negative point of view, but I did not intrude my opinions or disturb his mind at that solemn moment. Death-bed changes, though some clergy may rejoice in them, are really vain things. His brain, however, was as clear as ever, and his mind was occupied with all manner of strange knowledge, which he imparted in the intervals of his pain, in the curious high nasal voice which was characteristic. I can see him now, his knees drawn up to ease internal pain, and his long thin nose and reddish-grey goatee protruding over the sheet, while he creaked out: \\"Byzantine art, my dear Doyle, was of three periods, the middle one roughly coinciding with the actual fall of the Roman Empire. The characteristics of the first period——\\" and so on, until he would give a cry, clasp his hands across his stomach, and wait till the pain passed before resuming his lecture. His dear little wife nursed him devotedly, and mitigated the gloom of those moments which can be made the very happiest in life if one understands what lies before one. One thinks, as a contrast, of Dr. Hodgson's impatient cry, \\"I can hardly wait for death!\\" Grant Allen's strong opinions in print, and a certain pleasure he took in defending outside positions, gave quite a false view of his character, which was gentle and benignant. I remember his coming to a fancy dress ball which we gave in the character of a Cardinal, and in that guise all the quiet dignity of the man seemed to come out and you realized how much our commonplace modern dress disguises the real man. He used to tell with great amusement how a couple, who afterwards became close friends, came first to call, and how as they waited on the doorstep the wife said to the husband: \\"Remember, John, if he openly blasphemes, I leave the room.\\" He had, I remember, very human relations with the maids who took a keen interest in their employer's scientific experiments. On one occasion these were connected with spiders, and the maid rushed into the drawing-room and cried: \\"Oh, sir, Araminta has got a wasp.\\" Araminta was the name given to the big spider which he was observing at the time. Grant Allen had no actual call to write fiction, but his brain was agile enough to make some sort of job of anything to which it turned. On the other hand, as a popular scientist he stood alone, or shared the honour with Samuel Laing. His only real success in fiction was the excellent short story John Creedy, where he combined science with fiction, with remarkable results. At the time when I and so many others turned to letters there was certainly a wonderful vacancy for the new-comer. The giants of old had all departed. Thackeray, Dickens, Charles Reade and Trollope were memories. There was no great figure remaining save Hardy rising. The novelist was Mrs. Humphrey Ward, who was just beginning her career with \\"Robert Elsmere,\\" the first of that series of novels which will illuminate the later Victorian era more clearly than any historian ever can do. I think it was Hodgkin who said, when he read \\"Count Robert of Paris \\": \\"Here have I been studying Byzantium all my life, and I never understood it until this blessed Scotch lawyer came along.\\" That is the special prerogative of imagination. Trollope and Mrs. Ward have the whole Victorian civilization dissected and preserved. Then there were Meredith, unintelligible to most, and Walter Besant. There was Wilkie Collins, too, with his fine stories of mystery, and finally there was James Payn. Payn was much greater than his books. The latter were usually rather mechanical, but to get at the real man one has to read such articles as his \\"Literary Reminiscences,\\" and especially his \\"Backwater of Life.\\" He had all that humorous view which Nature seems to give as a compensation to those whose strength is weak. Had Payn written only essays he would have rivalled Charles Lamb. I knew him best in his latter days, when he was crippled with illness, and his poor fingers so twisted with rheumatic arthritis that they seemed hardly human. He was intensely pessimistic as to his own fate. \\"Don't make any mistake, Doyle, death is a horrible thing—horrible! I suffer the agonies of the damned!\\" But five minutes later he would have his audience roaring with laughter, and his own high treble laugh would be the loudest of all. His own ailments were frequently a source of mirth. I remember how he described the breaking of a blood-vessel in Bournemouth and how they carried him home on a litter. He was dimly conscious of the fir-woods through which he passed. \\"I thought it was my funeral, and that they had done me well in the matter of plumes.\\" When he told a story he was so carried away by his sense of humour that he could hardly get the end out, and he finished up in a kind of scream. An American had called upon him at some late hour and had discoursed upon Assyrian tablets. \\"I thought they were something to eat,\\" he screamed. He was an excellent whist player, and the Baldwin Club used to send three members to his house on certain days so that the old fellow should not go without his game. This game was very scientific. He would tell with delight how he asked some novice: \\"Do you play the penultimate?\\" To which the novice answered: \\"No—but my brother plays the American organ.\\" Many of my generation of authors had reason to love him, for he was a human and kindly critic. His writing however, was really dreadful. It was of him that the story was told than an author handed one of his letters to a chemist for a test. The chemist retired for a time and then returned with a bottle and demanded half a crown. Better luck attended the man who received an illegible letter from a railway director. He used it as a free pass upon the line. Payn used to joke about his own writing, but it was a very real trouble when one could not make out whether he had accepted or rejected one's story. There was one letter in which I could only read the words \\"infringement of copyright.\\" He was very funny when he described the work of the robust younger school. \\"I have received a story from——\\" he said, \\"5,000 words, mostly damns.\\" I knew Sir Henry Thompson, the famous surgeon, very well, and was frequently honoured by an invitation to his famous octave dinners, at which eight carefully chosen male guests were always the company. They always seemed to me to be the most wonderful exhibitions of unselfishness, for Thompson was not allowed any alcohol, or anything save the most simple viands. Possibly, however, like Meredith and the bottle of burgundy, he enjoyed some reflex pleasure from-the enjoyment of others. He had been a wonderful viveur and judge of what was what, and I fear that I disappointed him, for I was much more interested in the conversation than the food, and it used to annoy me when some argument was interrupted in order to tell us that it was not ordinary ham but a Westphalian wild boar that we were eating and that it had been boiled in wine for precisely the right time prescribed by the best authorities. But it was part of his wonderful unselfish hospitality to make his guests realize exactly what it was that was set before them. I have never heard more interesting talk than at these male gatherings, for it is notorious that though ladies greatly improve the appearance of a feast they usually detract from the quality of the talk. Few men are ever absolutely natural when there are women in the room. There was one special dinner, I fancy it was the hundredth of the series, which was particularly interest-ing as the Prince of Wales, now George V, was one of the eight, and gave us a most interesting account of the voyage round the world from which he had just returned. Of the rest of the company I can only recall Sir Henry Stanley, the traveller, and Sir Crichton Browne. Twenty years later I met the King when he visited a trade exhibition, and I attended as one of the directors of Tuck's famous postcard firm. He at once said: \\"Why, I have not seen you since that pleasant dinner when you sat next to me at Sir Henry Thompson's.\\" It seemed to me to be a remarkable example of the royal gift of memory. I have not often occupied a chair among the seats of the mighty. My life has been too busy and too preoccupied to allow me to stray far from my beaten path. The mention of the Prince, however, reminds me of the one occasion when I was privileged to entertain—or to attempt to entertain—the present Queen. It was at a small dinner to which I was invited by the courtesy of Lord Midleton whose charming wife, once Madeleine Stanley daughter of Lady Helier, I could remember since her girlhood. Upon this occasion the Prince and Princess came in after dinner, the latter sitting alone at one end of the room with a second chair beside her own, which was occupied successively by the various gentlemen who were to be introduced to her. I was led up in due course, made my bow, and sat down at her request. I confess that I found it heavy going at first, for I had heard somewhere that Royalty has to make the first remark, and had it been the other way there was such a gulf between us that I should not have known where to begin. However she was very pleasant and gracious and began asking me some questions about my works which brought me on to very easy ground. Indeed, I became so interested in our talk that I was quite disappointed when Mr. John Morley was led up, and I realized that it was time for me to vacate the chair. There was another amusing incident on that eventful evening. I had been asked to take in Lady Curzon, whose husband, then Viceroy of India, had been unable to attend. The first couple had passed in and there was a moment's hesitation as to who should go next, but Lady Curzon and I were nearest the door, so possibly with some little encouragement from the lady we filed through. I thought nothing of the incident but some great authority upon these matters came to me afterwards in great excitement. \\"Do you know,\\" he said, \\"that you have established a precedent and solved one of the most difficult and debatable matters of etiquette that has ever caused ill-feeling in British Society?\\" \\"The Lord Chancellor and the College of Heralds should be much obliged to you, for you have given them a definite lead. There has never been so vexed a question as to whether a Vice-reine when she is away from the country where she represents royalty shall take precedence over a Duchess. There was a Duchess in the room, but you by your decided action have settled the matter for ever.\\" So who shall say that I have done nothing in my life? Of the distinguished lights of the law whom I have met from time to time I think that Sir Henry Hawkins—then become Lord Bampton—made the most definite impression. I met him at a week-end gathering at Cliveden, when Mr. Astor was our host. On the first night at dinner, before the party had shaken down into mutual acquaintance, the ex-judge, very old and as bald as an ostrich egg, was seated opposite, and was wreathed with smiles as he made himself agreeable to his neighbour. His appearance was so jovial that I remarked to the lady upon my left: \\"It is curious to notice the appearance of our vis-â-vis and to contrast it with his reputation,\\" alluding to his sinister record as an inexorable judge. She seemed rather puzzled by my remark, so I added: \\"Of course you know who he is.\\" \\"Yes,\\" said she, \\"his name is Conan Doyle and he writes novels.\\" I was hardly middle-aged at the time and at my best physically, so that I was amused at her mistake, which arose from some confusion in the list of guests. I put my dinner card up against her wine-glass, so after that we got to know each other. Hawkins was a most extraordinary man, and so capricious that one never knew whether one was dealing with Jekyll or with Hyde. It was certainly Hyde when he took eleven hours summing up in the Penge case, and did all a man could do to have all four of the prisoners condemned to death. Sir Edward Clarke was so incensed at his behaviour on this occasion that he gave notice when Hawkins retired from the bench that if there were the usual complimentary ceremonies he would protest. So they were dropped. I might, on the other hand, illustrate the Jekyll side of him by a story which he told me with his own lips. A prisoner had a pet mouse. One day the brute of a warder deliberately trod upon it. The prisoner caught up his dinner knife and dashed at the warder, who only just escaped, the knife stabbing the door as it closed behind him. Hawkins as judge wanted to get the man off, but the attempt at murder was obvious and the law equally clear. What was he to do? In his charge to the jury he said: \\"If a man tries to kill another in a way which is on the face of it absurd, it becomes a foolish rather than a criminal act. If, for example, a man in London discharged a pistol to hurt a man in Edinburgh, we could only laugh at such an offence. So also when a man stabs an iron-plated door while another man is at the other side of it we cannot take it seriously.\\" The jury, who were probably only too glad to follow such a lead, brought in a verdict of \\"Not guilty.\\" Another distinguished man of the law who left a very clear impression upon my mind was Sir Francis Jeune, afterwards Lord St. Helier. I attended several of Lady Jeune's famous luncheon parties, which were quite one of the outstanding institutions of London, like Gladstone's breakfasts in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. I am indebted to this lady for very many kind actions. Her husband always impressed me with his gentle wisdom and with his cultivated taste. He told me that if every copy of Horace were destroyed he thought that he could reconstruct most of it from memory. He presided over the Divorce Courts, and I remember upon one occasion I said to him: \\"You must have a very low opinion of human nature, Sir Francis, since the worst side of it is for ever presented towards you.\\" \\"On the contrary,\\" said he very earnestly, \\"my experience in the Divorce Courts has greatly raised my opinion of humanity. There is so much chivalrous self-sacrifice, and so much disposition upon the part of every one to make the best of a bad business that it is extremely edifying.\\" This view seemed to me to be worth recording.","completion":"Fui involucrado en el asunto porque la salud de Barrie falló debido a un duelo familiar. Recibí un telegrama urgente de él en Aldburgh, y al llegar allí lo encontré muy preocupado porque se había comprometido por este contrato, y sentía que en su estado actual no podía seguir adelante con él. Habría dos actos, y había escrito el primero, y tenía el escenario aproximado del segundo, con la secuencia completa de eventos, si es que se puede llamar secuencia. ¿Me uniría a él y le ayudaría a completarlo como coautor? Por supuesto, estaba muy feliz de servirle de cualquier manera. Sin embargo, mi corazón se hundió cuando, después de dar la promesa, examiné el trabajo. El único don literario que Barrie no tiene es el sentido del ritmo poético, y el instinto de lo que es permisible en verso. Las ideas y el ingenio estaban allí en abundancia. Pero la trama en sí misma no era fuerte, aunque el diálogo y las situaciones también eran ocasionalmente excelentes. Hice lo mejor que pude y escribí las letras para el segundo acto, y gran parte del diálogo, pero tenía que tomar la forma predestinada. El resultado no fue bueno. Sin embargo, la camaradería real de la producción fue muy divertida e interesante, y nuestro fracaso fue principalmente doloroso para nosotros porque decepcionamos al productor y al elenco. Fuimos muy criticados por los críticos, pero Barrie lo tomó todo con el espíritu más valiente. Encontré, al revisar mis documentos, un estado de cuenta tardío de Barrie que es buena lectura. EN CUENTA CON J. M. BARRIE ¿Por qué? Causa del retraso. Comentarios. A £1 Prestados en la Estación. El objeto se movía demasiado rápido. Doyle dice que lo prestó. B £12 Jane Annie de Gira. Movimiento o balanceo del Kodak. Mejor tarde que nunca. C £30 6 chelines 4 peniques, Dios sabe. Fallo al tirar del cordón. Doyle recibe 2/5 de un penique más de su parte. Nuestra asociación nunca fue tan estrechamente renovada, pero a lo largo de toda mi vida cambiante he tenido un respeto y afecto por Barrie que espero haya sido mutuo. Cómo colaboré con él en el críquet así como en el trabajo se cuenta en mi capítulo sobre Deporte. Henry Irving es uno de los otros grandes hombres con los que he estado en contacto cercano, ya que su actuación como Gregory Brewster nos puso en contacto. Cuando estaba produciendo \\"Coriolanus\\" bajaba a Hindhead y solía visitarnos por las tardes. Era aficionado a una copa de oporto; de hecho, era uno de los cuatro grandes hombres que, probablemente incorrectamente, el Honorable G. Russell dijo que bebían una botella cada noche, siendo el único rasgo que tenían en común estos grandes hombres. Los otros, recuerdo, eran Tennyson, Gladstone y Moisés Montefiori, y el último creo que era realmente cierto. Como todos los malos hábitos, al final alcanzaron al pecador, y fue eliminado a la edad de 116 años. Irving tenía un curioso ingenio seco que ocasionalmente era sardónico y malintencionado. Puedo creer bien que sus ensayos a menudo fueron la ocasión de resentimientos entre los hombres y lágrimas entre las damas. La inesperada naturaleza de sus comentarios tomaba a uno por sorpresa. Recuerdo que mi amigo Hamilton se quedó conmigo hasta las \\"pequeñas horas de la madrugada\\" con el famoso hombre, que se volvió un tanto didáctico sobre el tema de la Deidad o el Universo o algún otro tema tremendo, que trató muy solemnemente, y con gran extensión. Irving se sentó con sus intensos ojos clavados en la cara del orador, lo que alentó a Hamilton a seguir y seguir. Cuando por fin terminó, Irving comentó: \\"¡Qué comediante tan malo hubieras sido!\\" Finalizó su visita regalándome su copia de \\"Coriolanus\\" con todas sus notas y direcciones de escena: un relicario muy preciado. Muchas visiones de tiempos pasados ​​surgen ante mis ojos mientras escribo, pero mi libro perdería toda proporción si me detuviera en ellos. Veo a Henley, el formidable inválido, un hombre bucanero de barba roja y voz fuerte que solo podía arrastrarse, pues su espalda parecía estar rota. Era un gran poeta y crítico que parecía pertenecer a los ruidosos días de Marlowe de la poderosa línea y la pelea en la taberna. Veo también a Haggard, primero como el joven diplomático elegante, y más tarde como el hombre desgastado y barbudo con extrañas y vagas tendencias al misticismo. También veo a Shaw, con su voz agradable y suave y su frase mordaz. Era extraño que todas las verduras suaves que formaban su dieta lo hicieran más belicoso y, debo agregar, más descaritativo que el hombre carnívoro, tanto que no he conocido a ningún hombre literario que fuera más despiadado con los sentimientos de los demás. Y sin embargo, para conocerlo siempre era agradable. No podía resistir a una broma amarga o al perverso placer de adoptar una actitud impopular. Como ejemplo, recuerdo a Henry Irving contándome que cuando Shaw fue invitado al funeral de su padre, él escribió en respuesta: \\"Si yo estuviera en Westminster, Henry Irving se volvería en su tumba, como Shakespeare en su tumba si Henry Irving estuviera en Stratford\\". Puede que no lo tenga verbalmente exacto, pero estaba bastante cerca. Era el tipo de cosas escandalosas que él diría. Y sin embargo, se le puede perdonar todo cuando uno lee los gloriosos diálogos de algunas de sus obras. Parece subhumano en emoción y superhumano en intelecto. Shaw siempre fue una espina en el costado de Irving, y usualmente era la única nota discordante entre el coro de alabanzas que recibía cada nueva producción. En una noche de estreno en el Lyceum, esas maravillosas noches de estreno que nunca han sido igualadas, el flacucho irlandés con su cara verdosa, su barba roja y su expresión sarcástica debió haber sido como la cabeza de la muerte en el banquete para Irving. Irving atribuyó esta animosidad al pique de Shaw porque sus obras no fueron aceptadas, pero en esto estoy seguro de que hizo una injusticia. Era simplemente ese giro contrario en el hombre que lo hace deleitarse en oponerse a cualquier cosa que alguien más apruebe. No hay nada constructivo en él, y está destinado a estar en perpetua oposición. Nadie, por ejemplo, fue más fuerte por la paz y por el no militarismo que él, y recuerdo que cuando tomé la presidencia en una reunión en Hindhead para respaldar las propuestas de paz del Zar en La Haya, pensé para mí mismo, mientras veía a Shaw en una esquina de la habitación: \\"Bueno, esta vez al menos debe estar en simpatía\\". Pero lejos de ser así, saltó a sus pies y presentó una serie de ingeniosos motivos por los cuales estas propuestas de paz serían desastrosas. Hagas lo que hagas, siempre estaba en contra de ti. Quizás no sea algo malo tener el otro punto de vista expresado continuamente, y los británicos soportan ese tipo de cosas mejor que otras naciones. Si Shaw hubiera dicho en América lo que dijo en Inglaterra sobre la guerra mientras estaba en curso, habría estado en peligro personal. Sin embargo, hubo momentos en los que sus extraños impulsos contrarios se volvieron perfectamente brutales en su funcionamiento. Uno fue en el momento del desastre del Titanic, cuando deliberadamente escribió una carta en un momento en que las heridas estaban crudas, abrumando a todos los implicados con amargas críticas. Me sentí movido para escribir una réplica, y tuvimos un fuerte debate en público, que de ninguna manera modificó nuestras amables relaciones personales. Puedo recordar un ejemplo más pequeño pero igualmente injustificable de su naturaleza agria cuando estaba en Hindhead. Se había organizado una fiesta en el jardín para alguna caridad, e incluía las escenas del bosque de \\"Como gustéis\\", que fueron realizadas por aficionados, y muy bien hechas. Shaw, sin ninguna provocación, escribió una columna entera de abuso en el periódico local, salpicando a todos los actores y su actuación con burla, y cubriéndolos de confusión, aunque de hecho no tenían nada de qué avergonzarse. Se mencionan estas cosas como características de un lado del hombre, y como prueba, temo, que la adopción por el mundo de una dieta vegetariana no pondrá fin al pensamiento o las acciones crueles. Pero con todo eso Shaw es una criatura afable para conocer, y estoy preparado para creer que hay un lado humano y amable en su naturaleza aunque no se ha presentado al público. Se necesitaba a un buen hombre para escribir \\"Santa Juana\\". Wells, también lo he conocido desde hace mucho tiempo, y de hecho debo haber entrado a menudo en la tienda de telas en la que trabajaba en Southsea, ya que el dueño era mi paciente. Wells es uno de los grandes frutos que la educación popular nos ha dado, ya que vino, como él se enorgullece de afirmar, desde el corazón del pueblo. Su franqueza democrática y la completa ausencia de sentimiento de clase son ocasionalmente embarazosas. Recuerdo que una vez me preguntó si había jugado al críquet en Liphook. Dije que sí. Él dijo: \\"¿Notaste a un viejo que actúa como profesional y cuidador del campo?\\" Dije que sí. \\"Ese era mi padre\\", dijo Wells. Me sorprendió tanto que no pude responder, y solo pude felicitarme a mí mismo de no haber hecho ningún comentario desagradable antes de saber la identidad del viejo. Siempre he tenido mis dudas sobre esos elaborados pronósticos del futuro en los que Wells se deleita. Es cierto, ha acertado un par de veces que ya se han materializado en los tanques y en la máquina que entregaría noticias en nuestras propias casas. Pero nunca ha mostrado ninguna percepción del verdadero significado de lo psíquico, y por falta de ello, su historia del mundo, tan elaborada y notable como era, me pareció un cuerpo sin alma. Sin embargo, también esto puede serle dado, y completará su equipamiento. Recuerdo discutir el asunto con él, cuando George Gissing, Hornung, él y yo nos reunimos en Roma a principios de siglo, pero aparentemente mis palabras no tuvieron efecto. Willie Hornung, mi cuñado, es otro de mis vívidos recuerdos. Era un Dr. Johnson sin la erudición pero con un ingenio más fino. Nadie podía decir algo más pulido, y sus escritos, buenos como son, nunca representaron adecuadamente los poderes del hombre, ni la rapidez de su cerebro. Estas cosas dependen del tiempo y la moda, y no impresionan en el relato, pero recuerdo cómo, cuando le mostré el récord de alguien que afirmaba haber hecho 100 yardas en menos de diez segundos, él dijo: \\"Es un error de corredor\\". No le gustaba el golf, porque decía que era \\"de mal gusto golpear una pelota sentada\\". Su crítica de mi Sherlock Holmes fue: \\"Aunque podría ser más humilde, no hay policía como Holmes\\". Creo que puedo afirmar que su famoso personaje Raffles era una especie de inversión de Sherlock Holmes, con Bunny como Watson. Lo admite tanto en su amable dedicatoria. Creo que hay pocos ejemplos más finos de escritura de cuentos cortos en nuestro idioma que estos, aunque confieso que creo que son bastante peligrosos en su sugerencia. Se lo dije antes de que pusiera pluma sobre papel, y el resultado ha sido, me temo, como yo esperaba. No debes hacer del criminal un héroe. Jerome, también, es un viejo amigo. Tiene un alma aventurera, y en un momento comenzó con un tiro de cuatro. Recuerdo haberme sentado en lo alto de él, y cuando uno de los líderes se dio la vuelta y echó un buen vistazo al conductor, pensé que era hora de bajarme. Maxwell también es un viejo amigo. Por supuesto, es el hijo de Miss Braddon, que se casó con un editor de ese nombre. Lo respeto por hacer un trabajo de hombre en la guerra cuando, a pesar de tener cincuenta años y haber llevado una vida sedentaria, se ofreció como voluntario para un batallón de combate, un crédito que comparte con A. E. W. Mason. El trabajo de Maxwell siempre me ha atraído mucho, y desde hace mucho tiempo lo considero el mejor novelista que tenemos. Nunca conocí a Robert Louis Stevenson en persona, aunque le debo mucho a él en el espíritu literario. Nunca podré olvidar el deleite con el que leí esas primeras historias suyas en la \\"Cornhill\\", antes de que conociera el nombre del autor. Todavía pienso que \\"El Pabellón en los Eslabones\\" es una de las grandes historias cortas del mundo, aunque hubo alteraciones en la forma final que fueron para peor, y mostraron la mojigatería por parte de los editores. El último año de Stevenson en la Universidad de Edimburgo debe haber coincidido con mi primer año aproximadamente, y Barrie también debió haber estado en ese viejo nido gris de aprendizaje alrededor del año 1876. Es extraño pensar que probablemente me codeé con ambos en el abarrotado portal. Desde su lejano hogar en Samoa parecía estar atento a los asuntos literarios en Inglaterra, y tuve cartas muy alentadoras de él en 1893 y 1894. \\"O frolic fellow-spookist\\" fue su curioso término de saludo personal en una de estas, que mostraba que compartía mi interés en la investigación psíquica pero que no la tomaba muy en serio. No puedo adivinar cómo en ese momento lo había detectado, aunque sabía que él mismo en sus primeros días había actuado como secretario de una sociedad de investigación psíquica o más bien de espiritistas en Edimburgo, que estudiaba el notable mediumnismo de Duguid. Sus cartas para mí consistían en un aprecio amable por mi trabajo. \\"Tengo un gran talento para el cumplido\\", dijo, \\"acompañado de una franca aversión, incluso diabólica\\". Había estado contando algunas de mis historias de Sherlock Holmes a sus sirvientes nativos; no debería haber pensado que necesitaba recurrir a nadie más, y se quejó en una carta cómica de la dificultad de contar una historia cuando tenías que detenerte a cada momento para explicar qué era un ferrocarril, qué era un ingeniero y demás. A pesar de todas las dificultades, logró contar la historia y dijo: \\"Si hubieras podido ver los ojos brillantes y febriles de Simite, habrías saboreado la gloria\\". Pero explicó que los nativos tomaban todo literalmente y que no había tal cosa como una historia imaginaria para ellos. \\"Yo, quien escribe esto, he tenido la indiscreción de perpetrar una pequeña pieza de ficción, 'El Diablillo de la Botella'. Las partes que acuden a visitar mi mansión, después de haber admirado el techo de Vanderputty y el tapiz de Gobbling, manifiestan al final cierta inquietud que demuestra ser gente de infinita delicadeza. Puede verse a uno encoger un hombro moreno, levantar un ojo expresivo y al final el secreto estalla entre ellos: '¿Dónde está la botella?'\\" En otra carta dijo que como yo había escrito sobre mi primer libro en el \\"Idler\\" el también lo haría. \\"No me retendría cuando la pluma blanca de Conan Doyle ondeaba frente a mí\\". Entonces, al menos, puedo jactarme de que es gracias a mí que el mundo debe el pequeño boceto personal sobre \\"La Isla del Tesoro\\" que apareció ese año. No puedo olvidar el impacto que fue para mí cuando, conduciendo por el Strand en un coche de caballos en 1896, vi en un póster amarillo de la tarde \\"Muerte de Stevenson\\". Algo parecía haber salido de mi mundo. Me pidieron sus albaceas que terminara la novela \\"St. Ives\\", que él había dejado tres cuartos completada, pero no me sentí a la altura de la tarea. Sin embargo, se hizo, y, entiendo, muy bien hecha, por Quiller-Couch. Es algo muy difícil continuar la historia de otro hombre y debe ser un esfuerzo más o menos mecánico. Tuve una experiencia de ello cuando mi vecino en Hindhead, Grant Allen, estaba en su"},{"prompt":"Traduce -> I was asked by his executors to finish the novel \\"St. Ives,\\" which he had left three-quarters completed, but I did not feel equal to the task. It was done, however, and, I understand, very well done, by Quiller-Couch. It is a desperately difficult thing to carry on another man's story, and must be a more or less mechanical effort. I had one experience of it when my neighbour at Hindhead, Grant Allen, was on his death-bed. He was much worried because there were two numbers of his serial, \\"Hilda Wade,\\" which was running in \\"The Strand\\" magazine, still uncompleted. It was a pleasure for me to do them for him, and so relieve his mind, but it was difficult collar work, and I expect they were pretty bad. Some time afterwards a stranger, who evidently confused Allen and me, wrote to say that his wife had given him a baby girl, and that in honour of me he was calling her Hilda Wade. He was really nearer the truth than appeared at first sight. I well remember that death-bed of Grant Allen's. He was an agnostic of a type which came very near atheism, though in his private life an amiable and benevolent man. Believing what he did, the approach of death must have offered rather a bleak prospect, and as he had paroxysms of extreme pain the poor fellow seemed very miserable. I had often argued the case with him, I from a Theistic and he from a negative point of view, but I did not intrude my opinions or disturb his mind at that solemn moment. Death-bed changes, though some clergy may rejoice in them, are really vain things. His brain, however, was as clear as ever, and his mind was occupied with all manner of strange knowledge, which he imparted in the intervals of his pain, in the curious high nasal voice which was characteristic. I can see him now, his knees drawn up to ease internal pain, and his long thin nose and reddish-grey goatee protruding over the sheet, while he creaked out: \\"Byzantine art, my dear Doyle, was of three periods, the middle one roughly coinciding with the actual fall of the Roman Empire. The characteristics of the first period——\\" and so on, until he would give a cry, clasp his hands across his stomach, and wait till the pain passed before resuming his lecture. His dear little wife nursed him devotedly, and mitigated the gloom of those moments which can be made the very happiest in life if one understands what lies before one. One thinks, as a contrast, of Dr. Hodgson's impatient cry, \\"I can hardly wait for death!\\" Grant Allen's strong opinions in print, and a certain pleasure he took in defending outside positions, gave quite a false view of his character, which was gentle and benignant. I remember his coming to a fancy dress ball which we gave in the character of a Cardinal, and in that guise all the quiet dignity of the man seemed to come out and you realized how much our commonplace modern dress disguises the real man. He used to tell with great amusement how a couple, who afterwards became close friends, came first to call, and how as they waited on the doorstep the wife said to the husband: \\"Remember, John, if he openly blasphemes, I leave the room.\\" He had, I remember, very human relations with the maids who took a keen interest in their employer's scientific experiments. On one occasion these were connected with spiders, and the maid rushed into the drawing-room and cried: \\"Oh, sir, Araminta has got a wasp.\\" Araminta was the name given to the big spider which he was observing at the time. Grant Allen had no actual call to write fiction, but his brain was agile enough to make some sort of job of anything to which it turned. On the other hand, as a popular scientist he stood alone, or shared the honour with Samuel Laing. His only real success in fiction was the excellent short story John Creedy, where he combined science with fiction, with remarkable results. At the time when I and so many others turned to letters there was certainly a wonderful vacancy for the new-comer. The giants of old had all departed. Thackeray, Dickens, Charles Reade and Trollope were memories. There was no great figure remaining save Hardy rising. The novelist was Mrs. Humphrey Ward, who was just beginning her career with \\"Robert Elsmere,\\" the first of that series of novels which will illuminate the later Victorian era more clearly than any historian ever can do. I think it was Hodgkin who said, when he read \\"Count Robert of Paris \\": \\"Here have I been studying Byzantium all my life, and I never understood it until this blessed Scotch lawyer came along.\\" That is the special prerogative of imagination. Trollope and Mrs. Ward have the whole Victorian civilization dissected and preserved. Then there were Meredith, unintelligible to most, and Walter Besant. There was Wilkie Collins, too, with his fine stories of mystery, and finally there was James Payn. Payn was much greater than his books. The latter were usually rather mechanical, but to get at the real man one has to read such articles as his \\"Literary Reminiscences,\\" and especially his \\"Backwater of Life.\\" He had all that humorous view which Nature seems to give as a compensation to those whose strength is weak. Had Payn written only essays he would have rivalled Charles Lamb. I knew him best in his latter days, when he was crippled with illness, and his poor fingers so twisted with rheumatic arthritis that they seemed hardly human. He was intensely pessimistic as to his own fate. \\"Don't make any mistake, Doyle, death is a horrible thing—horrible! I suffer the agonies of the damned!\\" But five minutes later he would have his audience roaring with laughter, and his own high treble laugh would be the loudest of all. His own ailments were frequently a source of mirth. I remember how he described the breaking of a blood-vessel in Bournemouth and how they carried him home on a litter. He was dimly conscious of the fir-woods through which he passed. \\"I thought it was my funeral, and that they had done me well in the matter of plumes.\\" When he told a story he was so carried away by his sense of humour that he could hardly get the end out, and he finished up in a kind of scream. An American had called upon him at some late hour and had discoursed upon Assyrian tablets. \\"I thought they were something to eat,\\" he screamed. He was an excellent whist player, and the Baldwin Club used to send three members to his house on certain days so that the old fellow should not go without his game. This game was very scientific. He would tell with delight how he asked some novice: \\"Do you play the penultimate?\\" To which the novice answered: \\"No—but my brother plays the American organ.\\" Many of my generation of authors had reason to love him, for he was a human and kindly critic. His writing however, was really dreadful. It was of him that the story was told than an author handed one of his letters to a chemist for a test. The chemist retired for a time and then returned with a bottle and demanded half a crown. Better luck attended the man who received an illegible letter from a railway director. He used it as a free pass upon the line. Payn used to joke about his own writing, but it was a very real trouble when one could not make out whether he had accepted or rejected one's story. There was one letter in which I could only read the words \\"infringement of copyright.\\" He was very funny when he described the work of the robust younger school. \\"I have received a story from——\\" he said, \\"5,000 words, mostly damns.\\" I knew Sir Henry Thompson, the famous surgeon, very well, and was frequently honoured by an invitation to his famous octave dinners, at which eight carefully chosen male guests were always the company. They always seemed to me to be the most wonderful exhibitions of unselfishness, for Thompson was not allowed any alcohol, or anything save the most simple viands. Possibly, however, like Meredith and the bottle of burgundy, he enjoyed some reflex pleasure from-the enjoyment of others. He had been a wonderful viveur and judge of what was what, and I fear that I disappointed him, for I was much more interested in the conversation than the food, and it used to annoy me when some argument was interrupted in order to tell us that it was not ordinary ham but a Westphalian wild boar that we were eating and that it had been boiled in wine for precisely the right time prescribed by the best authorities. But it was part of his wonderful unselfish hospitality to make his guests realize exactly what it was that was set before them. I have never heard more interesting talk than at these male gatherings, for it is notorious that though ladies greatly improve the appearance of a feast they usually detract from the quality of the talk. Few men are ever absolutely natural when there are women in the room. There was one special dinner, I fancy it was the hundredth of the series, which was particularly interest-ing as the Prince of Wales, now George V, was one of the eight, and gave us a most interesting account of the voyage round the world from which he had just returned. Of the rest of the company I can only recall Sir Henry Stanley, the traveller, and Sir Crichton Browne. Twenty years later I met the King when he visited a trade exhibition, and I attended as one of the directors of Tuck's famous postcard firm. He at once said: \\"Why, I have not seen you since that pleasant dinner when you sat next to me at Sir Henry Thompson's.\\" It seemed to me to be a remarkable example of the royal gift of memory. I have not often occupied a chair among the seats of the mighty. My life has been too busy and too preoccupied to allow me to stray far from my beaten path. The mention of the Prince, however, reminds me of the one occasion when I was privileged to entertain—or to attempt to entertain—the present Queen. It was at a small dinner to which I was invited by the courtesy of Lord Midleton whose charming wife, once Madeleine Stanley daughter of Lady Helier, I could remember since her girlhood. Upon this occasion the Prince and Princess came in after dinner, the latter sitting alone at one end of the room with a second chair beside her own, which was occupied successively by the various gentlemen who were to be introduced to her. I was led up in due course, made my bow, and sat down at her request. I confess that I found it heavy going at first, for I had heard somewhere that Royalty has to make the first remark, and had it been the other way there was such a gulf between us that I should not have known where to begin. However she was very pleasant and gracious and began asking me some questions about my works which brought me on to very easy ground. Indeed, I became so interested in our talk that I was quite disappointed when Mr. John Morley was led up, and I realized that it was time for me to vacate the chair. There was another amusing incident on that eventful evening. I had been asked to take in Lady Curzon, whose husband, then Viceroy of India, had been unable to attend. The first couple had passed in and there was a moment's hesitation as to who should go next, but Lady Curzon and I were nearest the door, so possibly with some little encouragement from the lady we filed through. I thought nothing of the incident but some great authority upon these matters came to me afterwards in great excitement. \\"Do you know,\\" he said, \\"that you have established a precedent and solved one of the most difficult and debatable matters of etiquette that has ever caused ill-feeling in British Society?\\" \\"The Lord Chancellor and the College of Heralds should be much obliged to you, for you have given them a definite lead. There has never been so vexed a question as to whether a Vice-reine when she is away from the country where she represents royalty shall take precedence over a Duchess. There was a Duchess in the room, but you by your decided action have settled the matter for ever.\\" So who shall say that I have done nothing in my life? Of the distinguished lights of the law whom I have met from time to time I think that Sir Henry Hawkins—then become Lord Bampton—made the most definite impression. I met him at a week-end gathering at Cliveden, when Mr. Astor was our host. On the first night at dinner, before the party had shaken down into mutual acquaintance, the ex-judge, very old and as bald as an ostrich egg, was seated opposite, and was wreathed with smiles as he made himself agreeable to his neighbour. His appearance was so jovial that I remarked to the lady upon my left: \\"It is curious to notice the appearance of our vis-â-vis and to contrast it with his reputation,\\" alluding to his sinister record as an inexorable judge. She seemed rather puzzled by my remark, so I added: \\"Of course you know who he is.\\" \\"Yes,\\" said she, \\"his name is Conan Doyle and he writes novels.\\" I was hardly middle-aged at the time and at my best physically, so that I was amused at her mistake, which arose from some confusion in the list of guests. I put my dinner card up against her wine-glass, so after that we got to know each other. Hawkins was a most extraordinary man, and so capricious that one never knew whether one was dealing with Jekyll or with Hyde. It was certainly Hyde when he took eleven hours summing up in the Penge case, and did all a man could do to have all four of the prisoners condemned to death. Sir Edward Clarke was so incensed at his behaviour on this occasion that he gave notice when Hawkins retired from the bench that if there were the usual complimentary ceremonies he would protest. So they were dropped. I might, on the other hand, illustrate the Jekyll side of him by a story which he told me with his own lips. A prisoner had a pet mouse. One day the brute of a warder deliberately trod upon it. The prisoner caught up his dinner knife and dashed at the warder, who only just escaped, the knife stabbing the door as it closed behind him. Hawkins as judge wanted to get the man off, but the attempt at murder was obvious and the law equally clear. What was he to do? In his charge to the jury he said: \\"If a man tries to kill another in a way which is on the face of it absurd, it becomes a foolish rather than a criminal act. If, for example, a man in London discharged a pistol to hurt a man in Edinburgh, we could only laugh at such an offence. So also when a man stabs an iron-plated door while another man is at the other side of it we cannot take it seriously.\\" The jury, who were probably only too glad to follow such a lead, brought in a verdict of \\"Not guilty.\\" Another distinguished man of the law who left a very clear impression upon my mind was Sir Francis Jeune, afterwards Lord St. Helier. I attended several of Lady Jeune's famous luncheon parties, which were quite one of the outstanding institutions of London, like Gladstone's breakfasts in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. I am indebted to this lady for very many kind actions. Her husband always impressed me with his gentle wisdom and with his cultivated taste. He told me that if every copy of Horace were destroyed he thought that he could reconstruct most of it from memory. He presided over the Divorce Courts, and I remember upon one occasion I said to him: \\"You must have a very low opinion of human nature, Sir Francis, since the worst side of it is for ever presented towards you.\\" \\"On the contrary,\\" said he very earnestly, \\"my experience in the Divorce Courts has greatly raised my opinion of humanity. There is so much chivalrous self-sacrifice, and so much disposition upon the part of every one to make the best of a bad business that it is extremely edifying.\\" This view seemed to me to be worth recording.","completion":"Fui solicitado por sus albaceas para terminar la novela \\"St. Ives\\", la cual él había dejado tres cuartos completada, pero no me sentí a la altura de la tarea. Se hizo, sin embargo, y, según entiendo, muy bien hecha por Quiller-Couch. Es extremadamente difícil continuar con la historia de otro hombre y debe ser un esfuerzo más o menos mecánico. Tuve una experiencia de esto cuando mi vecino en Hindhead, Grant Allen, estaba en su lecho de muerte. Estaba muy preocupado porque había dos entregas de su serie, \\"Hilda Wade\\", que se publicaba en la revista \\"The Strand\\", aún sin completar. Para mí fue un placer hacerlas por él y así aliviar su mente, pero fue un trabajo difícil y espero que hayan sido bastante malas. Algún tiempo después, un desconocido, que evidentemente confundió a Allen y a mí, escribió para decir que su esposa le había dado una niña y que en mi honor la llamaba Hilda Wade. Él estaba realmente más cerca de la verdad de lo que parecía a primera vista. Recuerdo bien ese lecho de muerte de Grant Allen. Era un agnóstico de un tipo que rozaba el ateísmo, aunque en su vida privada era un hombre afable y benévolo. Creyendo lo que creía, la proximidad de la muerte debió haber ofrecido una perspectiva bastante sombría, y como tenía paroxismos de dolor extremo, el pobre hombre parecía muy miserable. A menudo había discutido el caso con él, yo desde un punto de vista teísta y él desde uno negativo, pero no me entrometí con mis opiniones ni perturbé su mente en ese momento solemne. Los cambios de última hora en el lecho de muerte, aunque algunos clérigos puedan regocijarse en ellos, son realmente cosas vanas. Su cerebro, sin embargo, estaba tan claro como siempre, y su mente estaba ocupada con todo tipo de extraño conocimiento, lo cual impartía en los intervalos de su dolor con la curiosa voz nasal aguda que era característica. Puedo verlo ahora, con las rodillas levantadas para aliviar el dolor interno, y su larga nariz delgada y barba canosa rojiza sobresaliendo por encima de la sábana, mientras decía con voz chillona: \\"El arte bizantino, mi querido Doyle, tuvo tres períodos, el del medio coincidiendo aproximadamente con la caída real del Imperio Romano. Las características del primer período...\\" y así sucesivamente, hasta que daba un grito, se agarraba las manos sobre el estómago y esperaba hasta que el dolor pasara antes de retomar su charla. Su querida pequeña esposa lo cuidaba devotamente y mitigaba la oscuridad de esos momentos que pueden ser los más felices de la vida si uno entiende lo que le espera. Uno piensa, como contraste, en el impaciente grito del Dr. Hodgson: \\"¡Apenas puedo esperar la muerte!\\" Las firmes opiniones de Grant Allen en la prensa y el cierto placer que tomaba al defender posiciones externas, daban una visión bastante falsa de su carácter, que era gentil y benévolo. Recuerdo cuando vino a un baile de disfraces que dimos en el personaje de un Cardenal, y en esa apariencia, toda la tranquila dignidad del hombre parecía salir y te dabas cuenta de cuánto disfraza nuestro común vestido moderno al hombre real. Solía contar con gran diversión cómo una pareja, que luego se convirtió en amiga cercana, vino por primera vez a visitarlo y cómo mientras esperaban en el umbral de la puerta, la esposa le dijo al esposo: \\"Recuerda, John, si él blasfema abiertamente, yo salgo de la habitación\\". Él tenía, recuerdo, relaciones muy humanas con las criadas que tenían gran interés en los experimentos científicos de su empleador. En una ocasión, estos estaban relacionados con arañas, y la criada irrumpió en la sala de estar y gritó: \\"¡Oh, señor, Araminta tiene una avispa!\\" Araminta era el nombre que se le daba a la araña grande que estaba observando en ese momento. Grant Allen no tenía realmente vocación para escribir ficción, pero su cerebro era lo suficientemente ágil para hacer algún tipo de trabajo en cualquier cosa a la que se dedicara. Por otro lado, como científico popular, estaba solo o compartía el honor con Samuel Laing. Su único verdadero éxito en la ficción fue el excelente cuento corto John Creedy, en el que combinó ciencia con ficción, con resultados notables. En la época en la que yo y tantos otros nos volcamos a las letras, ciertamente había una maravillosa vacante para el recién llegado. Los gigantes del pasado se habían ido todos. Thackeray, Dickens, Charles Reade y Trollope eran recuerdos. No quedaba ninguna gran figura salvo Hardy en ascenso. La novelista era Mrs. Humphrey Ward, quien estaba comenzando su carrera con \\"Robert Elsmere\\", el primero de esa serie de novelas que iluminarán la era victoriana tardía más claramente que cualquier historiador. Creo que fue Hodgkin quien dijo, cuando leyó \\"Count Robert of Paris\\": \\"He estado estudiando Bizancio toda mi vida y nunca lo entendí hasta que vino este bendito abogado escocés\\". Ese es el privilegio especial de la imaginación. Trollope y Mrs. Ward tienen toda la civilización victoriana diseccionada y preservada. Luego estaban Meredith, ininteligible para la mayoría, y Walter Besant. También estaba Wilkie Collins, con sus excelentes historias de misterio, y finalmente estaba James Payn. Payn era mucho más grande que sus libros. Estos últimos solían ser bastante mecánicos, pero para conocer al hombre real uno tiene que leer artículos como sus \\"Recuerdos Literarios\\" y especialmente su \\"Backwater of Life\\". Tenía toda esa visión humorística que la Naturaleza parece dar como compensación a aquellos cuya fuerza es débil. Si Payn hubiera escrito solo ensayos, habría rivalizado con Charles Lamb. Lo conocí mejor en sus últimos días, cuando estaba lisiado por una enfermedad, y sus pobres dedos estaban tan retorcidos por la artritis reumática que apenas parecían humanos. Era intensamente pesimista en cuanto a su propio destino. \\"No te equivoques, Doyle, la muerte es algo horrible, ¡horrible! ¡Sufro las agonías de los condenados!\\" Pero cinco minutos después tendría a su audiencia rugiendo de risa, y su propia risa aguda sería la más fuerte de todas. Sus propias dolencias eran a menudo motivo de risa. Recuerdo cómo describió la ruptura de un vaso sanguíneo en Bournemouth y cómo lo llevaron a casa en una camilla. Estaba vagamente consciente de los bosques de pinos por los que pasaba. \\"Pensé que era mi funeral, y que lo habían hecho bien en el asunto de las plumas\\". Cuando contaba una historia se dejaba llevar tanto por su sentido del humor que apenas podía sacar el final, y terminaba en una especie de grito. Un estadounidense lo había visitado a altas horas de la noche y había disertado sobre tablillas asirias. \\"Pensé que eran algo para comer\\", gritó. Era un excelente jugador de whist, y el Club Baldwin solía enviar tres miembros a su casa ciertos días para que el viejo no se quedara sin su juego. Este juego era muy científico. Solía contar con deleite cómo le preguntó a un novato: \\"¿Juegas al penúltimo?\\" A lo que el novato respondió: \\"No, pero mi hermano toca el órgano estadounidense\\". Muchos autores de mi generación tenían motivos para quererlo, ya que era un crítico humano y amable. Su escritura, sin embargo, era realmente horrible. Fue de él que se contó la historia que un autor entregó una de sus cartas a un químico para una prueba. El químico se retiró por un tiempo y luego regresó con una botella y exigió media corona. Mejor suerte tuvo el hombre que recibió una carta ilegible de un director de ferrocarril. La usó como pase gratuito para la línea. Payn solía bromear sobre su propia escritura, pero era un problema muy real cuando uno no podía discernir si había aceptado o rechazado la historia de uno. Hubo una carta en la que solo pude leer las palabras \\"infracción de derechos de autor\\". Era muy gracioso cuando describía el trabajo de la robusta escuela más joven. \\"He recibido una historia de——\\" dijo, \\"5,000 palabras, principalmente maldiciones\\". Conocí muy bien a Sir Henry Thompson, el famoso cirujano, y a menudo me sentí honrado por una invitación a sus famosas cenas de octava, en las que siempre había ocho invitados masculinos cuidadosamente seleccionados. Siempre me parecieron ser las exposiciones más maravillosas de desinterés, ya que Thompson no se le permitía el alcohol ni nada más que los manjares más simples. Sin embargo, es posible que, al igual que Meredith y la botella de Borgoña, disfrutara de algún placer reflejo por el disfrute de los demás. Había sido un gran viveur y juez de lo que estaba bien, y temo haberlo decepcionado, ya que me interesaba más la conversación que la comida, y me molestaba cuando se interrumpía algún argumento para decirnos que no era jamón ordinario sino un jabalí de Westfalia lo que estábamos comiendo y que había sido hervido en vino por exactamente el tiempo correcto prescrito por las mejores autoridades. Pero formaba parte de su maravillosa hospitalidad desinteresada hacer que sus invitados se dieran cuenta exactamente de lo que se les había puesto delante. Nunca he oído hablar más interesante que en estas reuniones masculinas, ya que es notorio que aunque las damas mejoran mucho la apariencia de un banquete, generalmente restan valor a la calidad de la conversación. Pocos hombres son absolutamente naturales cuando hay mujeres en la habitación. Hubo una cena especial, creo que fue la centésima de la serie, que fue particularmente interesante ya que el Príncipe de Gales, ahora Jorge V, fue uno de los ocho, y nos dio un relato más interesante del viaje alrededor del mundo del cual acababa de regresar. Del resto de la compañía solo puedo recordar a Sir Henry Stanley, el viajero, y a Sir Crichton Browne. Veinte años después me encontré con el Rey cuando visitó una exposición comercial, y asistí como uno de los directores de la famosa empresa de tarjetas postales Tuck. De inmediato dijo: \\"Vaya, no te he visto desde aquella agradable cena cuando te sentaste a mi lado en lo de Sir Henry Thompson\\". Me pareció ser un ejemplo notable del don real de la memoria. No he ocupado a menudo una silla entre los escaños de los poderosos. Mi vida ha sido demasiado ocupada y absorbente para permitirme alejarme mucho de mi camino trillado. La mención del Príncipe, sin embargo, me recuerda la única ocasión en la que tuve el privilegio de entretener, o al menos intentarlo, a la actual Reina. Fue en una pequeña cena a la que fui invitado por cortesía de Lord Midleton, cuya encantadora esposa, una vez Madeleine Stanley hija de Lady Helier, la recordaba desde su juventud. En esta ocasión, el Príncipe y la Princesa llegaron después de la cena, la última se sentó sola en un extremo de la habitación con una segunda silla junto a la suya, que fue ocupada sucesivamente por los diversos caballeros que iban a ser presentados a ella. Me acerqué a su debido tiempo, hice mi reverencia y me senté a su solicitud. Confieso que al principio lo encontré difícil, porque había escuchado en algún lugar que la realeza debe hacer la primera observación, y si hubiera sido al revés, había tal abismo entre nosotros que no habría sabido por dónde empezar. Sin embargo, ella fue muy agradable y amable y comenzó a hacerme algunas preguntas sobre mis obras que me llevaron a un terreno muy fácil. De hecho, me interesé tanto en nuestra conversación que me decepcionó bastante cuando se presentó el Sr. John Morley y me di cuenta de que era hora de ceder la silla. Hubo otro incidente divertido en esa noche tan memorable. Me habían pedido que acompañara a Lady Curzon, cuyo esposo, entonces Virrey de la India, no había podido asistir. La primera pareja había pasado y hubo un momento de vacilación sobre quién debería ser el siguiente, pero Lady Curzon y yo estábamos más cerca de la puerta, por lo que posiblemente con un poco de aliento de la dama pasamos por el camino. No pensé nada del incidente, pero una gran autoridad en estos asuntos se me acercó después en gran excitación. \\"¿Sabe\\", dijo, \\"que ha establecido un precedente y resuelto uno de los asuntos de etiqueta más difíciles y debatibles que alguna vez han causado malestar en la sociedad británica?\\" \\"El Lord Canciller y el Colegio de Heraldos deberían estarles muy agradecidos por haberles dado una guía definitiva. Nunca ha habido una cuestión tan problemática como si una Vice-reina, cuando está fuera del país donde representa a la realeza, debe tener prioridad sobre una Duquesa. Había una Duquesa en la habitación, pero usted por su acción decidida ha resuelto el asunto para siempre\\". Entonces, ¿quién puede decir que no he hecho nada en mi vida? De las distinguidas luces de la ley con las que he conocido de vez en cuando, creo que Sir Henry Hawkins, luego convertido en Lord Bampton, causó la impresión más definitiva. Lo conocí en una reunión de fin de semana en Cliveden, cuando el Sr. Astor fue nuestro anfitrión. En la primera noche de la cena, antes de que la fiesta se afianzara mutuamente, el ex juez, muy viejo y tan calvo como un huevo de avestruz, estaba sentado enfrente y estaba coronado de sonrisas mientras se hacía agradable con su vecina. Su apariencia era tan jovial que le comenté a la dama de mi izquierda: \\"Es curioso notar la apariencia de nuestro vis-a-vis y contrastarla con su reputación\\", aludiendo a su siniestro récord como un juez inexorable. Ella parecía algo desconcertada por mi comentario, por lo que agregué: \\"Por supuesto, usted sabe quién es él\\". \\"Sí\\", dijo ella, \\"su nombre es Conan Doyle y escribe novelas\\". Yo apenas tenía mediana edad en ese momento y estaba en mi mejor momento físico, por lo que me divertí su error, que surgió de cierta confusión en la lista de invitados. Coloque mi tarjeta de cena frente a la copa de vino, así que después de eso nos conocimos mejor. Hawkins era un hombre extraordinario y tan caprichoso que uno nunca sabía si estaba tratando con Jekyll o con Hyde. Ciertamente era Hyde cuando tomó once horas para resumir en el caso Penge, e hizo todo lo que un hombre podía hacer para que todos los prisioneros fueran condenados a muerte. Sir Edward Clarke estaba tan indignado por su comportamiento en esta ocasión que dio aviso cuando Hawkins se retiró del banquillo de que si había las ceremonias de cortesía habituales, protestaría. Por tanto, se suprimieron. Por otro lado, podría ilustrar el lado Jekyll de él con una historia que me contó con sus propias palabras. Un prisionero tenía un ratón mascota. Un día, el bruto de un carcelero pisó deliberadamente sobre él. El prisionero agarró su cuchillo de comida y se lanzó sobre el carcelero, quien apenas escapó, el cuchillo apuñalando la puerta mientras se cerraba detrás de él. Hawkins como juez quería dejar al hombre libre, pero el intento de asesinato era obvio y la ley igualmente clara. ¿Qué debía hacer? En su instrucción al jurado, dijo: \\"Si un hombre intenta matar a otro de una manera que es obviamente absurda, se convierte en un acto tonto más que criminal. Si, por ejemplo, un hombre en Londres disparaba un pistola para herir a un hombre en Edimburgo, solo podríamos reírnos de tal ofensa. Así también cuando un hombre apuñala una puerta blindada con hierro mientras otro hombre está al otro lado, no podemos tomárnoslo en serio\\". El jurado, que probablemente estaba más que contento de seguir tal línea, emitió un veredicto de \\"No culpable\\".

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how federal prosecutors in the US can move their case against a defendant from a venue in terms of the jury pool that is favorable to the defendant to one that is hostile to the defendant","completion":"Federal prosecutors in the United States wield substantial influence in determining the venue for a criminal case, and their choices can significantly impact the composition of the jury pool. They may strategically maneuver a case away from a venue where the jury pool could be sympathetic toward the defendant to a jurisdiction where the prevailing attitudes may be more hostile to the defendant's position. This process, while complex, is rooted in the legal framework that governs federal jurisdiction and venue selection. The initial step in relocating a federal case involves a nuanced understanding of the concept of venue itself. Venue refers to the geographical location where a federal criminal case is tried. Title 18 of the United States Code addresses the issue of venue for federal crimes. To commence such a strategic shift, prosecutors must identify a legally justifiable basis which aligns with the nature and circumstances of the alleged crimes. One of the primary methodologies prosecutors may employ to justify a change of venue is predicated on the multiplicity of jurisdictional bases inherent in federal crimes. Considering the interconnected nature of the federal judicial system and the often-cross-jurisdictional nature of federal offenses, prosecutors can argue that specific aspects of the crime took place in different districts, thereby opening the door to multiple potential venues. For instance, in cases involving financial crimes such as fraud or embezzlement, if the illicit transactions traversed various districts, each could qualify as a possible venue. To exemplify, suppose the defendant is accused of conducting an extensive embezzlement scheme that defrauds investors across several states. Although the defendant's business operations and, by extension, the hopeful jury pool, may be concentrated in a district known for its prosperity and corporate leniency, the fraudulent activities could have affected entities in a district that has been economically ravaged and is hostile toward corporate malfeasance. Prosecutors might pinpoint this latter district as the preferential venue for the case, emphasizing that significant elements of the crime directly harmed its residents, thus meeting the legal criteria for venue selection. Furthermore, in the event of a complex, multi-defendant case, where co-conspirators may be dispersed across various districts, prosecutors can advocate for a venue that would be less favorable to the defendant by presenting the argument that this particular district is central to the coordination or execution of the criminal enterprise. In addition to assessing jurisdictional claims upon which to base the venue, prosecutors can also invoke the legal doctrine of vicinage, a concept which ensures that a defendant is tried by a jury of peers from the locality where the crime was committed. By linking the criminal act to a specific populous within a particular district where sentiment is inclined against the defendant's type of crime, they can further reinforce the rationale for relocating the trial. Moreover, there are instances wherein pretrial publicity can play a crucial role. Prosecutors might argue that extensive media coverage or public opinion in the defendant's preferred venue has potentially biased the jury pool in favor of the defense, thereby compromising the integrity of the judicial process. This could lead to a court granting a change of venue to ensure the selection of an untainted and impartial jury, thereby incidentally relocating the case to a jurisdiction less favorable to the defendant. Throughout the adversarial maneuvering of venue selection, it must be noted that federal prosecutors must still operate within the confines of the law and the constitutional protections afforded to the defendant. They cannot arbitrarily move a case simply to convene a hostile jury; they must substantiate the move with reasoning grounded in legal principles and the specific facts of the case. Their arguments are meticulously crafted and presented to the courts, which will then weigh the merits of the request and the rights of the defendant before authorizing a venue change. Through this convergence of strategic argumentation, invocation of complex federal statutes, and adept understanding of the judicial landscape, federal prosecutors in the United States can guide their case against a defendant towards a venue that, through legitimate and legally sanctioned means, positions the jury composition in a potentially less favorable light for the defendant. This analysis elucidates the legal mechanisms and tactical considerations propelling such prosecutorial venue strategies, thus providing a window into the intricate dynamics of federal criminal litigation."},{"prompt":"Write a short song about a man (bird) trying to escape a toxic relationship with a controlling woman (Ivy).

His silhouette a strained, thin line, A marionette in her cruel design. (Chorus) Oh, Space Oddity, hear my plight, Free me from her binding rite. I'm just a Ziggy with clipped wings, Lost in her labyrinth of strings. (Bridge) Tell-tale heart began to beat, Pounding rhythms in twisted sheets. A raven quoting prophesied doom, Echoes in their love's catacomb. (Verse 3) Beneath the masque, his eyes did gleam, Chasing a different, distant dream. Where starry wisdom parts the lies, Above her weeping wisteria skies. (Chorus) Oh, Stardust crusader, take the stage, Break free from her binding cage. Let Aladdin sane, in wisdom, rise, Free of Ivy's cruel, love-disguised. (Ending Verse) As Ivy's lament brightly burns at dawn, A symphony of self, I'm moving on. The nightingale sings, I take its cue, And spread my wings of wax to skies brand new."},{"prompt":"Write a short song in a cinematic style about a man (bird) trying to escape a toxic relationship with a controlling woman (Ivy).

Fly from her grip, her dire embrace, Into the wild, my heart's truest place. (Bridge) Curtains fall on the charade we played, Applause is silence, her influence fades. A moment's breath, a step towards the light, Freedom's script in my sight. (Verse 3) As the orchestra swells, a rising tide, I find the strength that dwelt inside. The final act, with will I've drawn, Her haunting hymns, I will move on. (Chorus) Soar, I must, from this grand deceit, A spectacle where love and pain compete.

Per far sì che l'indicatore venga visualizzato su una finestra separata dal grafico dei prezzi principale, dovranno essere apportate alcune modifiche al codice. Qui ci sono i passaggi principali che dovrai intraprendere: 1. **Modificare la proprietà dell'indicatore**: cambia \`#property indicator_chart_window\` in \`#property indicator_separate_window\` per spostare l'indicatore in una propria finestra. 2. **Configura i buffer dell'istogramma**: siccome vuoi un istogramma, dovresti configurare i buffer dell'indicatore (come \`histou[]\` e \`histod[]\`) per essere disegnati come istogrammi. Sembrerebbe che tu abbia già delle righe di codice che fanno questo per questi buffer. \`\`\`mql4 SetIndexBuffer(0,histou); SetIndexStyle(0,DRAW_HISTOGRAM,EMPTY,EMPTY,chup); SetIndexBuffer(1,histod); SetIndexStyle(1,DRAW_HISTOGRAM,EMPTY,EMPTY,chdn); \`\`\` 3. **Rimuovere parti non necessarie**: dato che vogliamo un indicatore separato, puoi rimuovere o commentare parti di codice che disegnano barre e linee sul grafico principale (buffer come \`upb[]\`, \`dnb[]\`, \`upa[]\`, \`dna[]\` che sono configurati ma forse non vuoi visualizzarli nella finestra separata). 4. **Riempimento dei buffer dell'istogramma**: assicurati che i buffer \`histou[]\` e \`histod[]\` siano riempiti correttamente nel ciclo \`OnCalculate()\`. Se alcuni di questi buffer sono stati configurati per essere nascosti (\`clrNONE\`) perché originariamente non erano parte dell'istogramma separato, devi cambiarne il colore in quello che desideri. 5. **Rimuovere o modificare le visualizzazioni del buffer non necessarie**: Se ci sono buffer aggiuntivi che non sono necessari per la tua visualizzazione ad istogramma, potrebbero essere rimossi o impostati a \`EMPTY_VALUE\` all'interno della \`OnCalculate()\`. Ecco un frammento del nuovo \`OnInit\` con le modifiche necessarie per creare una finestra separata: \`\`\`mql4 int OnInit() { // ... (mantieni il codice precedente non correlato alla visualizzazione) // Modifica la proprietà dell'indicatore per visualizzarlo in una finestra separata IndicatorBuffers(2); SetIndexBuffer(0,histou); SetIndexStyle(0,DRAW_HISTOGRAM,EMPTY,EMPTY,ColorUp); SetIndexBuffer(1,histod); SetIndexStyle(1,DRAW_HISTOGRAM,EMPTY,EMPTY,ColorDn); // Configura ulteriori dettagli della finestra dell'indicatore qui // ... return(INIT_SUCCEEDED); } \`\`\` Assicurati anche di rimuovere o di modificare tutti i riferimenti ai buffer che non saranno utilizzati per l'istogramma nella \`OnCalculate()\`. Una volta che hai effettuato queste modifiche, il comportamento visivo dell'indicatore dovrebbe corrispondere a quello di un istogramma in una finestra a parte. Ricorda che dovrai testare le modifiche per assicurarti che funzionino come desiderato e che l'istogramma sia correttamente allineato con i dati del grafico dei prezzi se la relazione tra di essi è importante."},{"prompt":"sei in grado di riscrivere tutto l'indicatore con le modifiche?","completion":"Sì, posso fornirti una versione rivista dell'indicatore basata sui frammenti di codice che hai condiviso.

Dovrai implementare la specifica logica del tuo indicatore nel corpo del ciclo \`for\` trovato in \`OnCalculate\`, popolando il buffer \`histou_Buffer\` con i valori appropriati per l'istogramma. L'istogramma risultante verrà visualizzato in una finestra di indicatore separata grazie alla proprietà \`indicator_separate_window\`. Assicurati di testare il nuovo indicatore in un ambiente di trading demo per verificare la sua accuratezza e prestazioni prima di utilizzarlo per il trading reale. **Nota importante**: Il codice di esempio qui sopra è una semplice ristrutturazione e non riflette la logica completa o i calcoli del tuo indicatore originale. Sarà necessario aggiungere la tua logica specifica per calcolare correttamente i valori dell'istogramma."},{"prompt":"non mi sembra tutto il codice dell'indicatore","completion":"Mi scuso per l'incomprensione e per qualsiasi confusione derivante dalle risposte precedenti.
