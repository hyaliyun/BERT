If they are different, replace them with 1. - After one full operation cycle, the starting digits are erased, and only the new digits formed in the process remain. This repeats iteratively. 3. **Contradiction Approach**: Let's consider the first time this process results in all zeros on the circle. Suppose this first occurs after the ( k )-th operation. This means that the sequence of digits after the (( k-1 ))-th operation must have been such that the resulting operation gave zeros for every digit pair. 4. **Preceding Sequence**: - For this situation to be possible, the digits in the (( k-1 ))-th sequence must all be the same and, specifically, all ones. This conclusion arises because: - Because obtaining 0's from the procedure requires all previous digits to be either 0s or 1s. - Only a uniform sequence of 1's would result in only 0's in the next step since (1 oplus 1 = 0). 5. **Implication and Parity Argument**: - Let's consider the sequence before this uniform ones' configuration. For a sequence to produce all 1's from the operation, the pairwise adjacent digits must have been alternating (0 and 1). - This alternating pattern implies there were an equal number of 0's and 1's and the total number of digits would have to be even. 6. **Contradiction**: - However, the total number of digits in the circle initially was 4 ones and 5 zeros which sums up to 9 (an odd number). - Hence, this contradicts the necessity for an equal number of ones and zeros needed for an alternating sequence yielding uniform 1's that lead to only 0's in the subsequent operation. 7. **Conclusion**: Hence, it is impossible to reach a state where all digits are zero by following the described operations.

Notice that we need to find the range of the function ( frac{x^2}{x^4 + x^2 + 1} ). Using the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality (AM-GM inequality), we have ( x^4 + 1 geq 2x^2 ). Thus, [ x^4 + x^2 + 1 geq x^4 + frac{x^4 + 1}{2} = frac{3x^4 + 1}{2} geq frac{3x^4}{2}. ] This simply can be rearranged to show: [ x^4 + x^2 + 1 geq 3x^2, ] which implies: [ 0 leq frac{x^2}{x^4 + x^2 + 1} leq frac{1}{3}. ] 3. Now, we need to find the upper and lower bounds of ( f(x) ) based on the value of ( k ). - **Case 1:** ( k geq 1 ) If ( k geq 1 ), then ( k - 1 geq 0 ). As a result: [ 0 leq frac{(k-1)x^2}{x^4 + x^2 + 1} leq frac{1}{3}(k - 1), ] leading to: [ 1 leq f(x) leq frac{1}{3}(k+2). ] Therefore, when ( k geq 1 ), the maximum value of ( f(x) ) is ( frac{1}{3}(k+2) ), and the minimum value of ( f(x) ) is 1. - **Case 2:** ( k < 1 ) If ( k < 1 ), then ( k - 1 < 0 ). Consequently: [ 0 geq frac{(k-1)x^2}{x^4 + x^2 + 1} geq frac{1}{3}(k - 1), ] leading to: [ 1 geq f(x) geq frac{1}{3}(k+2). ] Therefore, when ( k < 1 ), the maximum value of ( f(x) ) is 1, and the minimum value of ( f(x) ) is ( frac{1}{3}(k+2) ). 4. Combining both cases, we have: - If ( k geq 1 ), the range of ( f(x) ) is from 1 to ( frac{1}{3}(k+2) ). - If ( k < 1 ), the range of ( f(x) ) is from ( frac{1}{3}(k+2) ) to 1. ( boxed{1 leq f(x) leq frac{1}{3}(k + 2) text{ for } k geq 1} ) ( boxed{frac{1}{3}(k + 2) leq f(x) leq 1 text{ for } k < 1} ) 5. Finally, for part (2), we need to find the value of ( k ) such that for any three real numbers ( a, b, c ), there exists a triangle with side lengths ( { f(a), f(b), f(c) } ). For this to happen, the minimum value must be at least half the maximum value: [ 2 min f(x) > max f(x). ] - If ( k geq 1 ), we have: [ 2 times 1 > frac{1}{3}(k + 2), ] solving this inequality: [ 2 > frac{1}{3}(k + 2) implies 6 > k + 2 implies k < 4. ] Therefore, for ( k geq 1 ), the condition is ( 1 leq k < 4 ). - If ( k < 1 ): [ 2 times frac{1}{3}(k + 2) > 1, ] solving this inequality: [ frac{2}{3}(k + 2) > 1 implies 2(k + 2) > 3 implies 2k + 4 > 3 implies 2k > -1 implies k > -frac{1}{2}. ] Therefore, for ( k < 1 ), the condition is ( -frac{1}{2} < k < 1 ). 6. Combining both parts, the required range of ( k ) that satisfies the triangle condition is: [ boxed{-frac{1}{2} < k < 4}. ]"},{"prompt":"an run 4 times as fast as b and gives b a start of 60 m . how long should the race course be so that a and b might reach in the same time ?","completion":"Let's denote the speed of runner A as ( v_A ) and the speed of runner B as ( v_B ).

When the train crosses a signal pole, it only has to cover its own length, which is 300 meters. It does this in 18 seconds.

The total distance covered when crossing the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform: Total distance = Length of train + Length of platform Total distance = 300 m + L The time taken to cross the platform is given as 39 seconds. Since the speed of the train remains the same, we can use the same speed to calculate the length of the platform: v = Total distance / time Substituting the known values: 16.67 m/s = (300 m + L) / 39 s Now, we solve for L: 16.67 m/s * 39 s = 300 m + L 650.13 m = 300 m + L Subtracting 300 m from both sides: 650.13 m - 300 m = L L = 350.13 m Therefore, the length of the platform is approximately boxed{350.13} meters."},{"prompt":"Onethird less than 30% of a certain number is equal to 36.

Base Case: - For n = 1, W_1 = b, which is clearly a palindrome. - For n = 2, W_1W_2 = bW_2 = ba, which is not a palindrome. However, the problem statement requires us to consider n geq 1, and we need to check the concatenation of more than one word.

(You may assume that ( x ) is not equal to any of ( r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4 )).","completion":"1. **Factoring (P(x)) Using Its Roots**: Given the polynomial ( P(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 - 13x^2 - 14x + 24 ), we know its roots are ( r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4 ). Hence, we can represent (P(x)) as: [ P(x) = (x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3)(x - r_4) ] 2. **Formulating (Q(x)) with Squared Roots**: The polynomial (Q(x)) is defined such that its roots are the squares of the roots of (P(x)), i.e., (r_1^2, r_2^2, r_3^2, r_4^2). Therefore, we write (Q(x)) as: [ Q(x) = (x - r_1^2)(x - r_2^2)(x - r_3^2)(x - r_4^2) ] and (Qleft(x^2right)) as: [ Qleft(x^2right) = left( x^2 - r_1^2 right) left( x^2 - r_2^2 right) left( x^2 - r_3^2 right) left( x^2 - r_4^2 right) ] 3. **Calculating the Quotient (Q(x^2)/P(x))**: From the expressions for (P(x)) and (Q(x^2)), we have: [ Qleft(x^2right) = (x^2 - r_1^2)(x^2 - r_2^2)(x^2 - r_3^2)(x^2 - r_4^2) ] Since (P(x) = (x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3)(x - r_4)), we divide (Q(x^2)) by (P(x)): [ frac{Qleft(x^2right)}{P(x)} = frac{(x^2 - r_1^2)(x^2 - r_2^2)(x^2 - r_3^2)(x^2 - r_4^2)}{(x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3)(x - r_4)} ] 4. **Simplifying the Quotient**: Recognize that (x^2 - r_i^2 = (x - r_i)(x + r_i)) for each (i). Thus: [ (x^2 - r_1^2) = (x - r_1)(x + r_1), quad (x^2 - r_2^2) = (x - r_2)(x + r_2) ] [ (x^2 - r_3^2) = (x - r_3)(x + r_3), quad (x^2 - r_4^2) = (x - r_4)(x + r_4) ] Substituting these into the quotient: [ frac{(x - r_1)(x + r_1)(x - r_2)(x + r_2)(x - r_3)(x + r_3)(x - r_4)(x + r_4)}{(x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3)(x - r_4)} ] The terms ((x - r_1), (x - r_2), (x - r_3), (x - r_4)) cancel out from the numerator and denominator, leaving: [ (x + r_1)(x + r_2)(x + r_3)(x + r_4) ] 5. **Final Remark Using (P(-x)): Note that (P(-x)) is: [ P(-x) = (-x - r_1)(-x - r_2)(-x - r_3)(-x - r_4) = (x + r_1)(x + r_2)(x + r_3)(x + r_4) ] Hence, [ frac{Q(x^2)}{P(x)} = P(-x) ] 6. **Conclusion**: Since (P(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 - 13x^2 - 14x + 24), substituting (-x) for (x) in (P(x)) yields: [ P(-x) = (-x)^4 + 2(-x)^3 - 13(-x)^2 - 14(-x) + 24 = x^4 - 2x^3 - 13x^2 + 14x + 24 ] Therefore, the simplified quotient is: [ boxed{x^4 - 2x^3 - 13x^2 + 14x + 24} ]"},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, angle ABC = 30^circ.

Let's calculate the weight of the non-water content first. The total weight of the oranges is 5 kilograms. Since 5% of this weight is the non-water content, we can calculate the weight of the non-water content as follows: Non-water content weight = 5% of 5 kg Non-water content weight = 0.05 * 5 kg Non-water content weight = 0.25 kg Now, let's assume that the next day, the concentration of water in the oranges decreases by 5%. This means that the water content is now 90% instead of 95%. However, the non-water content remains the same (0.25 kg), as it does not evaporate or change. To find the new total weight of the oranges, we need to calculate what percentage 0.25 kg is of the new total weight, given that it represents the 10% non-water content of the oranges. Let's denote the new total weight of the oranges as W kg. We can set up the following equation: 0.25 kg = 10% of W 0.25 kg = 0.10 * W Now, we solve for W: W = 0.25 kg / 0.10 W = 2.5 kg So, the new weight of the oranges, after the concentration of water decreases by 5%, is boxed{2.5} kilograms."},{"prompt":"Last Saturday, Marie sold 425 magazines and some newspapers.

The total possible sums after the roll are ( k+1, k+2, ldots, k+6 ). Since the outcome of the roll sums ( k ) modulo 7 is only possible if one of these sum is multiple of 7. Therefore, there is a ( frac{1}{6} ) chance that he rolls a number causing an immediate win. 4. **Probability Distribution**: If ( A ) rolls and leaves the tally as ( l ), the probability that the opponent does not win and ( A ) ultimately wins is ( 1 - x_l ). Thus, for the current player (say ( A )): [ x_k = frac{1}{6} sum_{substack{1 leq l leq 6 l neq k}} (1 - x_l) + frac{1}{6} ] 5. **Combine into a Summation**: Let ( s = sum_{l=1}^{6} x_l ). Simplifying, each ( x_k ) equation becomes: [ x_k = frac{1}{6} left( (6 - 1) - sum_{substack{1 leq l leq 6 l neq k}} x_l right) + frac{1}{6} ] Since ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_6 ) are equal (because of symmetry), we can denote the probability by ( x ): [ x = frac{1}{6} (5 - (s - x)) + frac{1}{6} ] 6. **Solve the Equation**: Since ( s = 6x ), substitute into the equation: [ x = frac{1}{6} (5 - (6x - x)) + frac{1}{6} ] Which simplifies to: [ x = frac{1}{6} (5 - 5x) + frac{1}{6} ] Simplifying further: [ x = frac{5(1 - x)}{6} + frac{1}{6} ] Bringing all terms with ( x ) on one side, we get: [ 6x - 5x = 5 + 1 ] Simplifying: [ 11x = 6 ] Hence: [ x = frac{6}{11} ] 7. **Final Results**: Nathaniel goes first but cannot win outright, he leaves Obediah to play and win if totals match the multiples of 7.

Applying the Pythagorean theorem in the relevant right triangles within our main triangle: [ begin{aligned} 14^2 - q^2 &= BE^2 = 13^2 - p^2, q^2 - p^2 &= 27. end{aligned} ] Given another condition ( p + q = 15 ), we solve these simultaneously. 2. **Step 2:** Solve for ( p ) and ( q ).

This verifies that the statement holds for n = 3. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume that the statement holds for some n geq 3, i.e., for U = {1, 2, ldots, n}, any n-2 subsets of U each containing at least 2 and at most n-1 elements can be split by some arrangement of U. 3. **Inductive Step**: We need to prove that the statement holds for n + 1. That is, for U = {1, 2, ldots, n+1} and any set of n-1 subsets of U each containing at least 2 and at most n-1 elements, there is an arrangement of U that splits all these subsets. 4. **Existence of Element a**: Let mathcal{F} be a family of n-1 subsets of U = {1, 2, ldots, n+1}. We can choose an element a in U such that: - a appears in all the n-element subsets of mathcal{F}. - a appears in at most one of the 2-element subsets of mathcal{F}. 5. **Intersection Analysis**: Let mathcal{F} contain k n-element subsets and m 2-element subsets (k + m leq n-1). - The intersection of the n-element subsets contains at least n+2-k elements. - At most m elements belong to more than one 2-element subset; thus, the remaining elements can be assigned to a. 6. **Choosing Subset A**: Let A be a 2-element subset that contains a, if such a subset exists; otherwise, let A be any subset from mathcal{F} containing a. 7. **Reduced Problem**: Exclude a from all subsets of mathcal{F} except A. This reduction results in at most n-2 subsets of U setminus {a}, each with at least 2 and at most n-1 elements. 8. **Apply Inductive Hypothesis**: By the inductive hypothesis, we can arrange the elements of U setminus {a} such that all subsets in mathcal{F} setminus {A} are split. 9. **Placing a**: Now, place a somewhere in the arrangement where it does not interfere with subset A. Specifically, it should not be placed in a way that interrupts the elements of A being adjacent. 10. **Conclusion**: We have constructed an arrangement of U that splits all the n-1 subsets in mathcal{F}: [ boxed{text{Proof Completed}} ]"},{"prompt":"f x is a real number and x^27x+6<0, what are the possible values for x? Use interval notation to express your answer.","completion":"To solve the inequality x^2 - 7x + 6 < 0, we first factor the quadratic expression on the left side. This gives us: [x^2 - 7x + 6 = (x - 1)(x - 6).] Now, we have the factored form (x - 1)(x - 6) < 0. This inequality tells us that the product of (x - 1) and (x - 6) is negative, which means that one factor must be positive while the other is negative, as the product of two numbers with the same sign (both positive or both negative) is always positive. We consider the critical points of the inequality, which are x = 1 and x = 6, and analyze the sign of the product in different intervals defined by these points: 1. **If x < 1**, then both x - 1 and x - 6 are negative, making their product positive. This does not satisfy our inequality. 2. **If x > 6**, then both x - 1 and x - 6 are positive, which also results in a positive product. This does not satisfy our inequality either. 3. **If x = 1 or x = 6**, then one of the factors is zero, making the product zero. However, our inequality is strictly less than zero, so these points do not satisfy the inequality. 4. **If 1 < x < 6**, then x - 1 is positive (since x is more than 1) and x - 6 is negative (since x is less than 6).

The lemma states: - Let ( p ) be a prime number. If a polynomial ( A(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0 ) with integer coefficients ( a_n, a_{n-1}, ldots, a_1, a_0 ) is reducible in ( mathbb{Z}[x] ), and the prime ( p ) divides the coefficients ( a_0, a_1, ldots, a_{n-2} ), but does not divide ( a_n ), and ( p^2 ) does not divide ( a_0 ), then ( p ) does not divide ( a_{n-1} ), and the polynomial ( A(x) ) must have a rational root. 3. **Proof of Lemma**: - Suppose ( A(x) ) is reducible in ( mathbb{Z}[x] ), so ( A(x) = B(x)C(x) ), where ( B(x) ) and ( C(x) ) are non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients. - For any ( i ), ( a_i = sum_{k=0}^i b_k c_{i-k} ). - Since ( a_0 = b_0 c_0 ) and ( p mid a_0 ) but ( p^2 nmid a_0 ), one of ( b_0 ) or ( c_0 ) is divisible by ( p ), and the other is not. Without loss of generality, assume ( p mid b_0 ) and ( p nmid c_0 ). - Let ( lambda ) be the smallest nonnegative integer such that ( p nmid b_lambda ). Then, ( a_lambda = sum_{k=0}^lambda b_k c_{lambda-k} ) has ( p nmid a_lambda ) because ( b_lambda c_0 ) is not divisible by ( p ). - Since ( p mid a_0, a_1, ldots, a_{n-2} ), ( lambda ) must be ( n-1 ) or ( n ). - If ( lambda = n ), ( B(x) ) has degree ( n ), making ( C(x) ) a constant, which is a contradiction. - Thus, ( lambda = n-1 ), and ( p nmid a_{n-1} ). Since ( B(x) ) has degree ( geq n-1 ), ( C(x) ) has degree ( leq 1 ), implying ( A(x) ) has a linear factor, i.e., a rational root. 4. **Application to the problem**: - The polynomial ( f(x) = x^n + ax^{n-1} + pq ) must have a rational root if it is reducible. - Since ( f(x) ) is monic with integer coefficients, any rational root must be an integer. - The integer root ( r ) must satisfy ( r^n + ar^{n-1} + pq = 0 ). - This implies ( pq = -r^n - ar^{n-1} = -(r + a)r^{n-1} ), which must be divisible by ( r^2 ). Since ( pq ) is squarefree, ( r ) must be ( pm 1 ). 5. **Finding ( a )**: - If ( r = 1 ), then ( 1^n + a cdot 1^{n-1} + pq = 0 ) implies ( 1 + a + pq = 0 ), so ( a = -1 - pq ). - If ( r = -1 ), then ( (-1)^n + a cdot (-1)^{n-1} + pq = 0 ) implies ( (-1)^n + a cdot (-1)^{n-1} + pq = 0 ), so ( a = 1 + (-1)^n pq ). 6. **Conclusion**: - The values of ( a ) are ( a = -1 - pq ) and ( a = 1 + (-1)^n pq ).

Vertices ( A_i ) are colored red if the number ( i ) is a power of two. Therefore, the red vertices correspond to ( i = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, dots ). 4. Let's determine how many regular 400-sided polygons can fit into a 34000-sided polygon. This can be calculated by dividing 34000 by 400: [ frac{34000}{400} = 85 ] Thus, there are 85 ways to choose sets of 400 vertices. So, you can construct 85 regular 400-gons from the 34000 vertices. 5. For one specific 400-gon, consider vertices represented as ( a + 85k ) where ( a ) is a fixed starting point and ( k ) ranges over integers such that each ( a + 85k leq 34000 ). 6.

Therefore, we note the remainders and locate them within the range of 1 to 85: ( 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 43 ). 11. Thus, there are 8 specific values of ( a ) where the specified ( a + 85k ) form indicates positions of red vertices. 12.

The projector divides the space into 8 octants, each containing a vertex. - An octant will contain at most 2 vertices; thus, by suitably rotating the projector's angle, one octant can be found which avoids containing any of the 8 vertices of the cube. 5. **Find a Non-Illuminated Octant**: - By slightly adjusting the angle at which the projector illuminates, there must exist one octant that avoids illuminating any vertices. - Considering that the problem only asks for a configuration where no vertices are illuminated. **Conclusion**: Yes, the projector can be rotated to avoid illuminating any of the vertices of the cube, according to the analysis and logic applied above.

Let x% be the discount rate that the merchant can offer. The original selling price of the item is 5 yuan, and the cost price is 4 yuan. The merchant aims to maintain a profit margin of at least 10% of the cost price. 1. The selling price after applying the discount can be expressed as 5 times (1 - frac{x}{100}). This is because the discount rate x% reduces the selling price by a fraction frac{x}{100} of itself. 2. The profit after discount is then the selling price after discount minus the cost price, which gives us 5 times (1 - frac{x}{100}) - 4. 3. The condition that the profit margin must not be less than 10% of the cost price translates to the profit being at least 4 times 10% = 0.4 yuan. Therefore, we have the inequality 5 times (1 - frac{x}{100}) - 4 geq 0.4. 4.

Now, let's identify the vowels in each set: - Set #1 has 3 vowels: {a, o, e}. - Set #2 has 1 vowel: {u}. We can calculate the probability of picking at least one vowel in two ways: by directly counting the favorable outcomes or by using the complement rule (1 - probability of picking no vowels). Let's use the complement rule: First, we find the probability of picking no vowels (i.e., picking only consonants from both sets). In set #1, there are 2 consonants: {b, d}. In set #2, there are 5 consonants: {k, l, m, n, p}. The number of outcomes with no vowels is the product of the number of consonants in each set: No vowel outcomes = 2 (from set #1) * 5 (from set #2) = 10 outcomes. Now, we find the probability of picking no vowels: Probability (no vowels) = No vowel outcomes / Total outcomes = 10 / 30 = 1/3. Finally, we find the probability of picking at least one vowel by subtracting the probability of no vowels from 1: Probability (at least one vowel) = 1 - Probability (no vowels) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.

Symmetry and the inherent properties of an inscribed quadrilateral provide that the triangles (AOB) and (COD) are similar by AA similarity (angle-angle similarity), as they share angles at the circle’s circumference. 4. Given the similarity of triangles (AOB) and (COD), we have: [ frac{OB}{OD} = frac{AB}{CD} ] 5. By the given proportion (AP : PB = CR : RD), this translates into: [ frac{PB}{AP} = frac{RD}{CR} implies frac{PB}{AB} = frac{RD}{CD} ] Thus, [ frac{PB}{RD} = frac{AB}{CD} = frac{OB}{OD} ] indicating that line segment (PQ) is proportionately divided by point (Q): [ frac{PQ}{QR} = frac{AB}{CD} ] 6. This implies point (Q) satisfies the segment ratio: [ frac{OQ}{OR} = frac{AB}{CD} = frac{PQ}{QR} ] Thus, (OQ) bisects (angle POR). 7. By the properties of similar triangles and angle bisectors, triangle (POQ) now ensures that (angle DOQ = angle BOQ). Consequently, point (Q) is equidistant from the lines (AD) and (BC). 8. The triangles (AQD) and (BQC) have the same height when perpendicular heights are dropped from (Q) to lines (AD) and (BC), respectively. 9. The ratio of the areas of triangles (AQD) and (BQC) can thus be determined solely by the base lengths (AD) and (BC): [ frac{[text{Area of } triangle AQD]}{[text{Area of } triangle BQC]} = frac{AD}{BC} ] 10. Given that (AD = x) and (BC = y), the desired ratio is: [ frac{[text{Area of } triangle AQD]}{[text{Area of } triangle BQC]} = frac{x}{y} ] Conclusively, the ratio of the areas of the triangles (AQD) and (BQC) is: [ boxed{frac{x}{y}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a circle C: (x1)^{2} + (y1)^{2} = 4 and two points A(a,0), B(a,0) where a > 0, if there exists only one point P on circle C such that angle APB = 90^{circ}, then the value of real number a is ( ).

This means the center of circle C, denoted as C(1,1), is at point (1,1) and the radius r of the circle is sqrt{4} = 2. - Points A and B are given as A(a,0) and B(-a,0), respectively, where a > 0. 2. **Equation of Circle with Diameter AB:** - The circle with diameter AB can be described by the equation x^{2} + y^{2} = a^{2}. This circle, which we'll call circle O, has its center at O(0,0) and a radius R = a. 3. **Condition for angle APB = 90^{circ}:** - If point P satisfies angle APB = 90^{circ}, then P must lie on the circle described by x^{2} + y^{2} = a^{2}. This is because, by the property of a circle, the angle subtended by a diameter on the circumference is a right angle. 4. **Tangency Condition Between Circle C and Circle O:** - Since there exists only one point P on circle C such that angle APB = 90^{circ}, it implies that circle C and circle O are tangent to each other. The distance between their centers, |OC|, must be equal to the absolute difference of their radii, which means |OC| = |2 - a| or |OC| = |2 + a|. 5. **Calculating |OC|:** - The distance |OC| can be calculated using the coordinates of O(0,0) and C(1,1), yielding |OC| = sqrt{(0-1)^{2} + (0-1)^{2}} = sqrt{2}. 6. **Solving for a:** - Setting |OC| = |2 - a| or |OC| = |2 + a| and substituting |OC| = sqrt{2}, we get two equations: - sqrt{2} = |2 - a| - sqrt{2} = |2 + a| - Solving these equations for a, we find that a = 2 - sqrt{2} or a = 2 + sqrt{2}.

This can be shown through angle chasing: - Note that (angle HAF) and (angle HAE) are right angles because (AF) and (BE) are altitudes. - Similarly, (angle FCH) and (angle EBM) are right angles, making (overline{ME}) and (overline{MF}) tangents to (omega). 3.

Firstly, we have the function ( g(x) = sqrt{x(1-x)} ) defined on the interval ([0,1]). 2. Consider the function ( h(x) = x cdot g(x) ). We aim to find the area under the curve of ( h(x) ) from ( x = 0 ) to ( x = 1 ). 3. Since ( g(x) ) is symmetric around ( x = frac{1}{2} ), let's use this property to simplify the calculation. Observe that: [ h(x) + h(1-x) = x g(x) + (1-x) g(1-x) ] 4. Given ( g(x) = g(1-x) ) due to symmetry, we can rewrite this equation as: [ h(x) + h(1-x) = x g(x) + (1-x) g(x) = g(x) ] 5. Therefore, for any ( x ) on ([0, 1]), the value ( h(x) + h(1-x) ) equals ( g(x) ). This indicates that for the interval ( [0, 1] ), the areas under ( h(x) ) and the curve ( g(x) ) switches symmetrically around the line ( x = frac{1}{2} ). 6. The graph of ( g(x) ) forms a semicircle with a radius of ( frac{1}{2} ). - This is because the function ( g(x) ) reaches its maximum at ( x = frac{1}{2} ). - At ( x = frac{1}{2} ): [ gleft(frac{1}{2}right) = sqrt{frac{1}{2} left(1 - frac{1}{2}right)} = sqrt{frac{1}{4}} = frac{1}{2} ] 7. So, the maximum height of ( g(x) ) being ( frac{1}{2} ), and it traces a semicircle. 8. The total area under the function ( g(x) ) for one full period ( [0, 1] ) would give us half the area of a complete circle of radius ( frac{1}{2} ). - The area of a circle with radius ( frac{1}{2} ) is ( pi left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 = frac{pi}{4} ). - Therefore, the area of the semicircle is ( frac{1}{2} times frac{pi}{4} = frac{pi}{8} ). 9. The area covered by ( h(x) ) (i.e., the integral of ( h(x) ) from 0 to 1) corresponds to half the bound area under ( g(x) ) as shown in the function property. Thus, simplifying the prior section, the area under ( y = h(x) ) i.e. ( int_{0}^{1} x sqrt{x (1-x)} , dx ) is half the semicircle's area as each partition generates an equal area around symmetric property. 10. Thus, the area under curve ( h(x) ) is: [ frac{1}{2} times frac{pi}{4} = frac{pi}{8} ] 11.

We will show that the second player can always put the first player in a position where the first player cannot force a win, while the second player can eventually ensure a win for themselves. 1. **Initial Setting**: - We have 2n + 1 points on a circle that are evenly spaced, starting from points A_0, A_1, ..., A_{2n} in a clockwise order. - The key condition is that the game ends if all triangles formed by the remaining points are obtuse-angled. 2. **Objective**: - For the second player to force the first player into always leaving a pair or sets of points that can never form an obtuse-angled triangle when they are the last three points remaining. 3. **Strategy**: - The second player will maintain a condition that before the k-th move of the first player (for 2n+1 geq 5), on each semicircle of the circle there are at least k points. This helps to prevent forming too few points on any semicircle, avoiding creating obtuse triangles prematurely. 4. **Induction Hypothesis**: - Assume before each move of the first player, the condition that each semicircle has at least k points is satisfied. 5. **Base Case**: - Initially, the condition holds true as we have 2n+1 points, and any semicircle will always have at least lceilfrac{2n+1}{2}rceil = n+1 geq 2 points (since n geq 2). 6. **Inductive Step**: - Suppose the first player removes a point, say A_0. Ensure a strategy such that if the first player removes A_0, the second player then removes the point A_k. - After this, any semicircle will still maintain the condition of having at least k-1 points. - If both points A_0 and A_k are on different semicircles, removing them doesn’t break the condition. - If both points are on the same semicircle, this semicircle still holds k-1 points. 7. **Critical Examination**: - If the second player follows this strategy correctly and doesn't make a mistake, the number of remaining points will eventually reduce to 5 (i.e., 2k-4 moves having been played). 8. **Endgame Scenario**: - At 2k-4 moves, 5 points are left, let’s say A_0, A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4. - The first player removes A_0. After which triangular A_1A_2A_4 is still not obtuse as all neighbors are close vertices. - The second player then removes A_4. - The final remaining points A_1, A_2, A_3 form triangle A_1A_2A_3 which will be obtuse because, if not, it implies an incorrect initial setting or miscalculation (given all possible scenarios, with only 3 points they must be in close neighbors; hence obtuse by angle sum property). 9. **Conclusion**: - With the second player’s calculated removals based on parity and positioning strategy, he ensures that as the game is played out, the remaining triangles formed will always leave an acute scenario to be overturned by the second player's removal of the right vertex.

To simplify the notation, let's define a k-strip as a 1 times 8 rectangle on the chessboard, where the first k cells are filled with white stones, and the remaining 8-k cells are empty. Step 1: Creating Initial 1-Strips 1. **Josie's First 22 Turns**: - Josie starts by finding 44 disjoint 1 times 9 rectangles on the board. - For the first 22 turns, Josie places a white stone in one end of each of these 44 rectangles. 2. **Ross's Moves**: - Ross \\"ruins\\" 22 of these rectangles by replacing a white stone in each with a black stone. - Therefore, Josie now has 22 unruined 1 times 9 rectangles, each of which can be considered a 1-strip (ignoring the empty ninth cell). 3. **Josie's Next 10 Turns**: - Josie then chooses 20 of the 22 ruined 1 times 9 rectangles and places a white stone in the other end of each, thus converting them into 1-strips (by ignoring the black stone in one of the cells). 4. **Ross's Moves**: - Ross then ruins an additional 10 of these new 1-strips by replacing the white stones with black stones. 5. **Result**: - In total, Josie is left with ( 22 + 20 - 10 = 32 ) disjoint 1-strips. Step 2: Extending to Longer Strips Josie now employs an iterative strategy to extend these strips incrementally: 1. **For k=1,2,3,4,5**: - Josie starts with 2^{6-k} disjoint k-strips. - She uses her next 2^{5-k} turns to add one white stone to each of these k-strips, converting them into (k+1)-strips. 2. **Ross's Moves**: - On Ross's next 2^{5-k} turns, he can ruin at most 2^{5-k} of these k-strips by replacing the newly added white stone with a black stone. - This leaves Josie with at least 2^{5-k} (k+1)-strips. Final Step: Achieving an 8-Strip 1. After iterating through k = 1 to k = 5, Josie will eventually have at least one 6-strip remaining. 2. On Josie's next turn, she places her two white stones into the two remaining empty cells in this 6-strip, thus forming an 8-strip.

If n is initially even, it remains even. If n is initially odd, it remains odd. - When one + and one - are erased and a - is added, the number n remains unchanged, thus the parity of n remains unchanged. - When two + signs are erased and a + is added, n remains unchanged, thus the parity of n remains unchanged. 5. **Parity Invariance:** - In all cases, the parity of n does not change through any operation. - This means n remains even or odd as it was initially. 6. **Initial Condition:** - Initially, we have 1967 symbols. - Suppose initially there are ( k ) - signs and ( 1967 - k ) + signs. - We focus on the parity of ( k ). 7. **Final Symbol Determination:** - If ( k ) (initially) is odd: the number of - signs on the board will remain odd, leading up to the final step, ensuring the last remaining symbol is -. - If ( k ) (initially) is even: the number of - signs on the board will remain even, leading up to the final step, ensuring the last remaining symbol is +. 8. **Conclusion:** - The parity of the number of - signs determines the last remaining symbol. - Hence, the final symbol does not depend on the order of operations but only on the initial count of - signs. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A 2% late charge was added to Mark's bill on the 45th day past its due date.

This implies that PC = AB and AP = AM. 4. **Construct Triangle**: Now we construct triangle APC because we know all three sides: AP, PC, and AC. 4.1. First, draw AC with length as given. 4.2. Then, use a compass to draw an arc with radius AP from point A. 4.3. Similarly, draw an arc with radius PC = AB from point C. 4.4. The intersection of these two arcs is the point P.

To ensure this inequality holds for all real numbers x, the discriminant (Delta) of the quadratic equation must be less than 0. This is because a positive discriminant would imply the existence of real roots, where the quadratic expression could equal zero or become negative, which contradicts the proposition. Thus, we calculate the discriminant as follows: [ Delta = (2a)^{2} - 4 cdot 1 cdot 1 = 4a^{2} - 4. ] Setting Delta < 0, we get: [ 4a^{2} - 4 < 0 implies a^{2} - 1 < 0 implies -1 < a < 1. ] **Step 2: Analyzing Proposition B** Proposition B states that the function y = log_{2a-1}x is monotonically decreasing on (0, +infty). For a logarithmic function to be monotonically decreasing, the base of the logarithm (in this case, 2a-1) must be between 0 and 1. Therefore, we set up the inequality: [ 0 < 2a - 1 < 1. ] Solving the left part of the inequality for a gives: [ 2a - 1 > 0 implies a > frac{1}{2}. ] Solving the right part of the inequality gives: [ 2a - 1 < 1 implies a < 1. ] Combining these, we find that frac{1}{2} < a < 1. **Step 3: Comparing Proposition A and Proposition B** From Step 1, we have that Proposition A requires -1 < a < 1, and from Step 2, Proposition B requires frac{1}{2} < a < 1. The interval for a in Proposition B is a subset of the interval in Proposition A, which means every a that satisfies Proposition B also satisfies Proposition A, but not every a that satisfies Proposition A will satisfy Proposition B.

Since the vertices must all have different colors, there are (5!) (5 factorial) ways to color them. [ mathrm{A}_5^5 = 5! = 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 120. ] Thus, there are 120 ways to color the vertices such that no two vertices have the same color. 2. **Coloring with exactly one pair of adjacent vertices the same color**: If we choose one pair of adjacent vertices to have the same color and the other vertices to be different colors, we proceed as follows: - Choose 1 of the 5 vertices as the starting vertex for the adjacent same-color pair: (mathrm{A}_5^1 = 5). - Choose a color for this pair: (mathrm{A}_5^1 = 5). - Color the remaining 3 vertices with the remaining 4 distinct colors, which is ( mathrm{A}_5^4 ): [ mathrm{A}_5^4 = 5 times 4 times 3 = 60. ] Then the total number of such colorings is: [ mathrm{A}_5^1 times mathrm{A}_5^1 times mathrm{A}_5^4 = 5 times 5 times 60 = 300. ] 3. **Coloring with two pairs of adjacent vertices the same color, leaving one vertex with a distinct color**: In this case: - Select 2 pairs from the 5 vertices. Each pair uses one of the colors. - Choose 2 colors for these pairs out of 5 to ensure the remaining vertex is distinct: This can be arranged in (mathrm{A}_5^2) ways but divided by the symmetry in permutations of pairs: [ mathrm{A}_5^2 = frac{5!}{3!} = 5 times 4 = 20. ] - Assign the non-adjacent single vertex the remaining color: [ 1 times 60 = 60. ] 4. **Summing up all valid combinations**: The valid cases are: all different vertices' colors + one pair adjacency + two adjacent pairs.

What is the percentage by which he cheats while selling?","completion":"Let's assume the cost price (CP) of the articles is 100. When the shop owner buys the articles using false weights, he cheats by 12%. This means he gets 12% more of the articles for the same price. So, for 100, he actually gets articles worth 100 + 12% of 100 = 100 + 12 = 112. Now, he wants to make a 40% profit on the cost price. So, the selling price (SP) should be 100 + 40% of 100 = 100 + 40 = 140. Since he already has articles worth 112 for the cost price of 100, he needs to sell these articles for 140 to make a 40% profit. Let's denote the percentage by which he cheats while selling as x%. This means that when he sells, he gives x% less than the actual amount the customer pays for. To find out the value of x, we need to equate the value of the articles he gives to the customer to the selling price he wants to achieve (140). So, if he sells articles worth 112 at a price of 140, he is giving the customer articles worth 112 for 140. This means he is giving the customer (112/140) * 100% = 80% of what they paid for.

According to the given information, we can express y as a function of x, where x is the amount by which the unit price is reduced. The new price per unit would be (50 - x) yuan, and the new monthly sales volume would be (300 + 10x) units. Therefore, the function representing the monthly sales revenue, y, in terms of x is: [ y = f(x) = (50 - x)(300 + 10x) ] Expanding this expression gives us: [ y = -10x^2 + 200x + 15000 ] We are interested in finding the values of x for which the monthly sales revenue, y, is not less than 15950 yuan.

We want to show that there exist primes ( q ) in the form ( 4k + 3 ) such that for a natural ( x ), we have: [ x^2 equiv -p_1^* p_2^* cdots p_t^* pmod{q} ] This is equivalent to: [ prod left( frac{-p_i^*}{q} right) = 1 iff prod left( frac{p_i}{q} right) = (text{sgn}) 1 ] where the sign of 1 will be determined uniquely based on ( p_i ) values modulo 4. By quadratic reciprocity, it's enough to find a prime ( q ) in the form ( 4k + 3 ) such that: [ prod left( frac{q}{p_i} right) = (text{sgn}) 1 ] If ( text{sgn} = + ), then by Dirichlet's theorem, there are infinitely many prime numbers ( q ) such that ( q equiv 1 pmod{p_1 p_2 cdots p_t} ) and ( q equiv 3 pmod{4} ), which works in the equality. If ( text{sgn} = - ), then take ( a ) as a quadratic nonresidue modulo ( p_1 ) and let ( q ) in the form ( 4k + 3 ) be ( q equiv a pmod{p_1} ) and ( q equiv 1 pmod{p_2 cdots p_t} ). Thus, the lemma is proved in both cases. 2. **Main Proof:** Suppose that for each ( a_i ), there exist infinitely many natural ( k ) such that ( ak + 1 ) and ( a_i k + 1 ) are both squares (ignoring others). We will show that there exists a number ( a_i ) such that ( aa_i ) is a perfect square. Suppose not. Notice that for each integer ( t ), if we take ( k_t = at^2 + 2t ), then ( ak_t + 1 ) is a perfect square. By the lemma, for each ( i ), there exist infinitely many primes ( q_1, q_2, ldots ) in the form ( 4k + 3 ) and numbers ( r_1, r_2, ldots ) such that for each ( j ) and ( x equiv r_j pmod{q_j} ), we have ( q_j mid aa_i x^2 + 1 ). For each number ( t equiv r_j pmod{q_j} ), numbers ( a_i k_t + 1 ) and ( a_i k_{-t} + 1 ) can't both be squares. Otherwise, we have: [ a_i k_t + 1 = x^2, quad a_i k_{-t} + 1 = y^2 implies 2(aa_i t^2 + 1) = x^2 + y^2 implies q_j mid x^2 + y^2 implies q_j mid x, y implies q_j mid gcd(4a_i t, aa_i t^2 + 2a_i t + 1) mid 4 ] which is a contradiction. So for each ( q_j ), there exists a number ( s_j ) (equal to ( r_j ) or ( -r_j ) modulo ( q_j )) such that for each ( t equiv s_j pmod{q_j} ), the number ( a_i k_t + 1 ) is not a perfect square. Now consider distinct primes ( q_1, ldots, q_n ) for ( a_1, ldots, a_n ) (which is possible because of the infinity). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), take a natural ( t ) such that ( t equiv s_i pmod{q_i} ) for each ( i le n ) and none of the numbers ( a_i k_t + 1 ) will be a perfect square. So there is an ( i ) such that ( aa_i ) is a square. Let ( aa_i = s_i^2 ) and the number ( s_i^2 t^2 + 2a_i t + 1 ) will be a square for infinitely many natural ( t ). Then ( s_i^4 t^2 + 2s_i^2 a_i t + s_i^2 ) and ( (s_i^2 t + a_i)^2 ) are both squares, so there are large enough squares with a constant distance ( s_i^2 - a_i^2 ). As a result, ( s_i^2 = a_i^2 ) and ( a = a_i ). Thus, we are done. (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"A sphere is inscribed in a cube, and the cube has a surface area of 54 square meters. A second cube is then inscribed within the sphere. What is the surface area in square meters of the inner cube?","completion":"1. **Calculate the side length of the original cube**: Given the surface area of the original cube is 54 square meters, and each face of the cube has an area of ( frac{54}{6} = 9 ) square meters. Thus, the side length ( s ) of the cube is ( sqrt{9} = 3 ) meters. 2. **Determine the diameter of the sphere inscribed in the cube**: The diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube, which is 3 meters. 3. **Calculate the side length of the inner cube**: The inner cube is inscribed within the sphere, so its diagonal is equal to the sphere's diameter, i.e., 3 meters. Using the Pythagorean Theorem in three dimensions for the inner cube, ( sqrt{l^2 + l^2 + l^2} = 3 ). Simplifying this gives ( sqrt{3l^2} = 3 ). Hence, ( 3l^2 = 9 ), so ( l^2 = 3 ) and ( l = sqrt{3} ) meters. 4. **Compute the surface area of the inner cube**: The surface area ( A ) is ( 6l^2 ), substituting ( l^2 = 3 ) gives ( A = 6 times 3 = 18 ) square meters.

Let ( M = { a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n } ). Consider the ( 2^{n-1} ) subsets of ( M ) that include the element ( a_n ). Specifically, let these subsets be formed by taking all subsets of the set ( { a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n-1} } ) and adding ( a_n ) to each of these subsets. Formally, these subsets can be written as: [ B_i = A_i cup { a_n }, quad text{for} ; i = 1, 2, cdots, 2^{n-1} ] where ( A_i ) are all the subsets of ( { a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n-1} } ). 2. **Step 2: Pairwise Intersection**: We need to show that any two of these subsets ( B_i ) and ( B_j ) intersect. Since ( a_n ) is present in every subset ( B_i ), we have: [ B_i cap B_j supseteq { a_n } neq varnothing ] Thus, any two subsets ( B_i ) and ( B_j ) from this collection of ( 2^{n-1} ) intersect. 3. **Step 3: Upper Bound on ( k )**: We next show that for any selection of ( 2^{n-1} + 1 ) subsets of ( M ), at least two of them are disjoint. Consider having ( 2^{n-1} ) subsets, each containing ( a_n ) as we earlier defined as ( B_1, B_2, cdots, B_{2^{n-1}} ). Now consider the complements of these subsets in ( M ), denoted as ( bar{B}_i = M backslash B_i ). Each ( bar{B}_i ) does not contain ( a_n ). Since ( B_i neq B_j ) for ( i neq j ), we also have ( bar{B}_i neq bar{B}_j ). Therefore, there are ( 2^{n-1} ) subsets containing ( a_n ) and ( 2^{n-1} ) subsets excluding ( a_n ), totaling ( 2^n ) unique subsets of ( M ). 4. **Step 4: Comparison and Conclusion**: Since there are ( 2^n ) total unique subsets of ( M ), any selection of ( 2^{n-1} + 1 ) subsets must include at least one pair where one subset is ( B_i ) and another is its complement ( bar{B}_i ). These two subsets are disjoint by definition because: [ B_i cap bar{B}_i = (A_i cup { a_n }) cap (M backslash (A_i cup { a_n })) = varnothing ] Therefore, the maximum value of ( k ) such that each subset pairwise intersects is ( 2^{n-1} ).

Let the smallest elements of these subsets be ( a ) (in ( A )), ( b ) (in ( B )), and ( c ) (in ( C )) with ( c > b > a ). 3. **Lemma 1**: Show that the numbers ( x ), ( y ), and ( x + y ) cannot belong to three different sets. _Proof_: If ( x in A ), ( y in B ), and ( x + y in C ), then: - ( f(x, x + y) = x^2 - x(x + y) + (x + y)^2 = x^2 - x^2 - xy + x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = x^2 + xy + y^2 = f(y, x + y) ). - Since ( f(x, x + y) in C ) and ( f(y, x + y) in C ), this would imply ( C cap B neq emptyset ), contradicting the assumption that ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) are distinct. Therefore, ( x ), ( y ), and ( x + y ) cannot belong to three different sets. 4. **Lemma 2**: The subset ( C ) contains a multiple of ( b ). Moreover, if ( kb ) is the smallest such multiple, then ((k - 1)b in B ) and ( (k - 1)b + 1, kb + 1 in A ). _Proof_: - Let ( r ) be the residue of ( c ) modulo ( b ). If ( r = 0 ), the statement holds trivially. - If ( 0 < r < b ), then ( r in A ). - Since ( c - r notin B ) (by Lemma 1), ( c - r in A ). As ( b mid (c - r) ), it follows that ( b mid f(c - r, b) in C ), proving the first statement. - By Lemma 1, ((k - 1)b in B ). - If ( (k - 1)b + 1 = kb - (b - 1) in A), then ( kb + 1 = ((k - 1)b + 2) + (b - 1) in A ). Therefore, ( kb + 1 in A ). 5. **Induction**: Show by induction that ((nk - 1)b + 1, nkb + 1 in A) for all integers ( n ). - **Base Case (n=1)**: Proven in Lemma 2. - **Inductive Step**: - Assume ( ((n - 1)k - 1 )b + 1 in A ) and ( (n - 1)kb + 1 in A ). - Then, ((nk - 1)b + 1 = ((n - 1)kb + 1) + (k - 1)b = [((n - 1)k - 1)b + 1] + kb in A ). - Also, ( nkb + 1 = ((nk - 1)b + 1) + b = ((n - 1)kb + 1) + kb in A ). These satisfy the inductive step. 6. **Conclusion**: - In particular, ( f(kb, kb + 1) = (kb + 1)kb + 1 in A ). - However, since ( kb in C ) and ( kb + 1 in A ), it follows ( f(kb, kb + 1) in B ), resulting in a contradiction.

Given: - The base radius of the cone is sqrt{2}. - The lateral surface of the cone, when unfolded, forms a semicircle. From the given information, we know that the circumference of the base of the cone is equal to the perimeter of the semicircle (since the lateral surface unfolds into a semicircle).

Each day, the detective can invite one or more of these 80 people. If the witness is among those invited but the criminal is not, the witness will reveal the identity of the criminal. Can the detective always solve the case within 12 days?","completion":"# Problem: Detective Nero Wolfe is investigating a crime in which 80 people are involved. Among them, one is the criminal, and another one is the witness to the crime (but it is unknown who they are). Each day, the detective can invite one or several of these 80 people, and if the witness is among the invited, but not the criminal, the witness will inform who the criminal is. Can the detective be guaranteed to solve the case in 12 days? Let's explore three different methods to solve the problem. Method 1: 1. **Number the suspects uniquely**: Assign a unique four-digit ternary number (overline{abcd}) to each of the 80 suspects, ranging from 0001 to 2222. Noteworthy, there are exactly (3^4 - 1 = 80) such numbers available. 2. **Daily invites**: On the (k)-th day ((k = 1, 2, ldots, 12)), Nero Wolfe invites those suspects whose numbers satisfy the specific (k)-th equality among the following: - (a = 0), (a = 1), (a = 2) - (b = 0), (b = 1), (b = 2) - (c = 0), (c = 1), (c = 2) - (d = 0), (d = 1), (d = 2) 3. **Guaranteed detection**: In one of these days, Wolfe will invite the witness without the criminal because their numbers differ in at least one digit, leading to the crime being resolved. Method 2: 1. **Group division**: Divide the suspects into 16 groups, each consisting of 5 people. Assign each group a unique four-digit binary number (abcd) ranging from 0000 to 1111. Assign numbers from 1 to 5 to the members within each group. 2. **Daily invites**: On the (k)-th day ((k = 1, 2, ldots, 8)), invite suspects from groups whose group number (abcd) satisfies the specific (k)-th equality among the following: - (a = 0), (a = 1) - (b = 0), (b = 1) - (c = 0), (c = 1) - (d = 0), (d = 1) 3. **Resolution if separated**: If the criminal and the witness are in different groups, the crime will be detected when the witness is invited alone, which guarantees resolution. 4. **Further invites if together**: Suppose the witness and the criminal are in the same group. Define their specific positions (m) (witness) and (n) (criminal). 5. On the 9th day: Invite suspects with numbers 1 and 2 from each group. 6. On the 10th day: Invite suspects with numbers 3 and 4 from each group. 7. On the 11th day: Invite suspects with numbers 1, 3, and 5. 8. On the 12th day: Invite suspects with numbers 2, 4, and 5. 9. **Guaranteed resolution**: One of these days will invite the witness without inviting the criminal, thereby solving the case. Method 3: 1. **Binary numbers assignment**: Assign each suspect a unique nine-digit binary number, with exactly four digits being 1s and five being 0s. There are ( binom{9}{4} = 126 ) such numbers available, ensuring uniqueness. 2. **Daily invites**: On the (k)-th day ((k = 1, 2, ldots, 9)), invite those suspects whose (k)-th digit in their binary representation is 1. 3. **Resolution met**: Since each number contains exactly four 1s, there will be a day (m) where the witness has a 1 in the (m)-th position, but the criminal has a 0. On this day, the witness is invited without the criminal, thereby identifying the criminal. Conclusion: Nero Wolfe can indeed solve the case within 12 days using the given strategies.

Let T be the second intersection of overline{A C_1} with the circumcircle of triangle APC (denoted as (A P C)). 2. To begin we will use properties of similar triangles, cyclic quadrilaterals, and parallel lines. We note from the problem statement: - triangle P C_1 T sim triangle A B C, which follows from similar triangles. 3. Given QC_1 parallel AC, this implies that the quadrilateral T C_1 Q P is cyclic because corresponding angles are equal. 4. The condition TQ parallel AB follows from the cyclic nature of T C_1 Q P. 5. Since TQ parallel AB and agree with the cyclic requirement, it implies T = B_1. 6. Thus, A, B_1, and C_1 are collinear, meaning T = B_1 directly satisfies our requirement for concurrence on the cyclic nature of points B_1, C_1, P, and Q. **Second Solution**: 1. We use barycentric coordinates to describe the position of the points. - Let P = (0, m, n) and Q = (0, r, s), where m + n = r + s = 1. 2.

According to the problem, the initial total volume of the mixture is 45 litres, so we have: M + W = 45 (Equation 1) We are also told that after adding 9 litres of water to the mixture, the ratio of milk to water becomes 2. This means that for every 2 litres of milk, there is 1 litre of water in the new mixture. Let's denote the new amount of water as W_new. We know that: W_new = W + 9 (Equation 2) And the new ratio of milk to water is: M / W_new = 2/1 So we can write: M = 2 * W_new (Equation 3) Now we can substitute Equation 2 into Equation 3 to get: M = 2 * (W + 9) Using Equation 1, we can substitute M with (45 - W): 45 - W = 2 * (W + 9) 45 - W = 2W + 18 45 - 18 = 2W + W 27 = 3W W = 27 / 3 W = 9 Now that we have the initial amount of water (W = 9 litres), we can find the initial amount of milk (M) using Equation 1: M + 9 = 45 M = 45 - 9 M = 36 So the initial amount of milk is 36 litres and the initial amount of water is 9 litres.

A: frac{11}{5} B: frac{12}{5} C: frac{13}{5} D: frac{14}{5}","completion":"Let's break down the solution into detailed steps: 1. **Understanding the Problem:** The task involves drawing balls from a bag containing 5 balls: 2 white, 2 black, and 1 red. The process stops once two balls of different colors are drawn. We define X as the number of draws needed to stop this process. Our goal is to find the expected value E(X) of X. 2. **Determining Possible Values of X:** The draws stop as soon as two balls of different colors are drawn. So, the earliest the process can stop is after 2 draws (if the first two balls are of different colors), and the latest it can stop is after 3 draws (if the first two balls are of the same color but the third is different). Therefore, X can only take the values 2 and 3. 3. **Calculating P(X=3):** For the process to require 3 draws, the first two draws must result in balls of the same color, and since there's only one red ball, these first two balls must be either white or black. The probability of drawing two whites followed by a non-white is frac{2}{5} times frac{1}{4}, and similarly, the probability of drawing two blacks followed by a non-black is frac{2}{5} times frac{1}{4}. Adding these probabilities gives: P(X=3) = frac{2}{5} times frac{1}{4} + frac{2}{5} times frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{5}. 4. **Calculating P(X=2):** Since X can only be 2 or 3, and we've found P(X=3), we can find P(X=2) by subtracting P(X=3) from 1 (the total probability): P(X=2) = 1 - P(X=3) = 1 - frac{1}{5} = frac{4}{5}. 5. **Calculating the Expected Value E(X):** The mathematical expectation E(X) can be calculated using the formula for expectation, which in this case is the sum of each value of X multiplied by its probability: E(X) = 2 cdot P(X=2) + 3 cdot P(X=3) = 2 cdot frac{4}{5} + 3 cdot frac{1}{5} = frac{8}{5} + frac{3}{5} = frac{11}{5}.

Substituting the areas, we have: [ 15^2 = b^2 + 10^2 + d^2 ] 5. Calculate (15^2) and (10^2): [ 15^2 = 225, quad 10^2 = 100 ] 6. Substitute these values into the equation: [ 225 = b^2 + 100 + d^2 ] 7.

We test different natural number pairs: - If (b = 2), then: [ b^2 = 2^2 = 4 implies 4 + d^2 = 125 implies d^2 = 121 implies d = 11 ] Thus, one solution is ((b, d) = (2, 11)) with: [ b + d = 2 + 11 = 13 ] - If (b = 5), then: [ b^2 = 5^2 = 25 implies 25 + d^2 = 125 implies d^2 = 100 implies d = 10 ] Thus, another solution is ((b, d) = (5, 10)) with: [ b + d = 5 + 10 = 15 ] Conclusion: There are two possible pairs ((b, d)) such that ( b + d ) equals either 13 or 15.

This means there exists a rational number ( x ) such that ( x^3 - 2015x = 2k + 1 ). Let ( x = frac{p}{r} ) where ( p, r in mathbb{Z} ) and ( gcd(p, r) = 1 ).

In the interval (0, x_1) we have f'(x) > 0, in (x_1, x_2) we have f'(x) < 0, and in (x_2, +infty) we have f'(x) > 0. Hence, x_1 and x_2 are the two extreme points of f(x), consistent with the problem statement, boxed{a > 4}. (2) To calculate f(x_1) + f(x_2), we sum the individual values at the extreme points: begin{align*} f(x_1) + f(x_2) &= aln x_1 + frac{1}{2}x_1^2 - ax_1 + aln x_2 + frac{1}{2}x_2^2 - ax_2 &= a(ln x_1 + ln x_2 - a + frac{1}{2}(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - (x_1 + x_2)) &= a(ln(x_1 x_2) - a + frac{1}{2}(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2cdotfrac{1}{2}(x_1 x_2) - (x_1 + x_2)). end{align*} Since x_1 and x_2 are the roots of the equation x^2 - ax + a = 0, by Vieta's formulas, we have x_1 + x_2 = a text{ and } x_1 x_2 = a. Substituting these relationships into our previous equation, we have f(x_1) + f(x_2) = a(ln a - a + frac{1}{2}a^2 - 2cdotfrac{1}{2}a - a) = a(ln a - frac{1}{2}a - 1). The inequality f(x_1) + f(x_2) < lambda(x_1 + x_2) can be rewritten as frac{f(x_1) + f(x_2)}{x_1 + x_2} < lambda. Since we've established x_1 + x_2 = a, it follows that frac{a(ln a - frac{1}{2}a - 1)}{a} = ln a - frac{1}{2}a - 1 text{ must be less than } lambda. Let y = ln a - frac{1}{2}a - 1. Then, we differentiate y with respect to a, y' = frac{1}{a} - frac{1}{2}. Since a > 4, it is clear that y' < 0; therefore, y is monotonically decreasing on the interval (4, +infty). Consequently, we conclude that y < ln 4 - 3. Given that the inequality f(x_1) + f(x_2) < lambda(x_1 + x_2) must always hold and x_1 + x_2 > 0, the minimum value for lambda is boxed{lambda_{text{min}} = ln 4 - 3}."},{"prompt":"Given that x in [0, 2pi], the domain of the function y = sqrt{tan x} + sqrt{cos x} is ( ).

The general form of such a function is: f(x) = Acos{x} + Bsin{x} = Rsin(x + theta), where R = sqrt{A^2 + B^2} and tantheta = frac{B}{A}. In this case, A = 2 and B = 1.

From tantheta = frac{1}{2}, we find the angle theta whose tangent is frac{1}{2}. This angle, theta, is a constant since the coefficients A and B are constants.

In the interval [-3, 4], frac{1 + x^{2019}}{1 + x} > 0, so the function g(x) is increasing in [-3, 4]. Since the even power terms of x in g(-3) are preceded by negative signs and the odd power terms are preceded by positive signs, g(-3) < 0.

Let’s go through the solution step by step: 1. **Assume the Existence of Point (M):** Suppose the sought point (M) on the line (l) is already constructed. Given (A) and (B) are on the same side of line (l), we need to find such point (M) on (l). 2. **Projection of Point (A):** Let (K) be the projection of point (A) onto the line (l). This means (K) is the foot of the perpendicular from (A) to (l). 3. **Circle Construction:** Construct a circle centered at (A) with radius equal to the distance (AK). This circle will be tangent to the line (l) at point (K), as (AK) is the radius and lies perpendicular to (l). 4. **Construct Tangent from Point (B):** Draw a tangent from point (B) to the circle. Let this tangent intersect the line (l) at point (M). The point (M) will then be the required point such that the line (MA) is the angle bisector of the angle between the lines (MB) and the tangent to the circle at point (K). To find point (M) on the line (l) such that the ray (MA) bisects the angle formed by the rays (MB) and another ray from (M) on line (l), one can use properties of circumscribed angles and tangents. From the properties of the circle, we know: - The center of the inscribed circle in an angle configuration (here at point (A)) lies on the angle bisector of that angle. - The projection of point (A) onto line (l), say point (K), serves as our reference to construct the necessary tangents. # Conclusion Drawing the tangent from (B) to the circle centered at (A) intersects line (l) in such a way that: 1.

No moves are needed, so ( N = 0 ). - For ( n = 2 ), there are two boxes, each containing two balls of different colors.

Since 10 percent of the third shift participate in the pension program, the number of members from the third shift who participate in the pension program is ( T times frac{10}{100} = frac{T}{10} ). The total number of members in the company is ( 60 + 50 + T ), and 24 percent of these participate in the pension program.

Since the hyperbola is frac{x^2}{a^2}-frac{y^2}{b^2}=1, its asymptotes are y = pmfrac{b}{a}x. We consider the positive slope asymptote for this problem, which is y = frac{b}{a}x. Rewriting this in standard linear form gives bx - ay = 0. 2. **Circle Information**: The circle given by x^{2}+left(y-2right)^{2}=4 has its center at (0,2) and a radius r = 2. 3. **Distance from Center to Asymptote**: The distance d from the center of the circle to the asymptote can be calculated using the formula for the distance from a point to a line: d = frac{|ax_1 + by_1 + c|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}, where ax + by + c = 0 is the line's equation and (x_1, y_1) is the point. Substituting the center (0,2) and the asymptote equation bx - ay = 0 (or -ay + bx = 0 in the form ax + by + c), we get d = frac{|-2a|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} = frac{2|a|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}. 4. **Chord Length and Circle Geometry**: The chord length formed by intersecting the circle with the asymptote is twice the distance from the center to the asymptote, minus the radius of the circle, due to the right triangle formed by the radius, the distance to the asymptote, and half the chord. Thus, 2sqrt{3} = 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2}. Substituting r = 2 and the expression for d, we get 2sqrt{3} = 2sqrt{4 - frac{4a^2}{a^2 + b^2}}. 5. **Solving for Eccentricity**: Simplifying the above equation, we find that c^2 = 4a^2, where c is the distance from the center to a focus of the hyperbola. The eccentricity e of the hyperbola is defined as e = frac{c}{a}. Substituting c^2 = 4a^2 into the formula for eccentricity, we find e = frac{sqrt{4a^2}}{a} = 2.

We need to find the maximum ( n ) such that this does not happen. 3. **Strategy:** - Consider the worst-case scenario where we try to use as many colours as possible while ensuring that at least one colour remains connected. 4. **Calculating the Maximum ( n ):** - The key observation is that if we use more than ( 2 times 2009 - 1 = 4017 ) colours, we can ensure that at least one colour is connected. - This is because in a ( 2009 times 2009 ) board, the maximum number of squares a queen can move through in a straight line (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) is ( 2009 ). Therefore, if we use more than ( 4017 ) colours, there will be at least one colour that appears in a connected manner. 5. **Proof:** - Suppose we use ( n ) colours to colour the ( 2009 times 2009 ) board. - If ( n leq 4017 ), we can colour the board in such a way that no colour is connected. For example, we can colour each row with a different colour, and then use the remaining colours to ensure that no two squares of the same colour are reachable by a queen's move. - If ( n > 4017 ), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one colour that appears in a connected manner because there are not enough rows, columns, or diagonals to separate all the colours.

This is derived from rearranging the hyperbola equation to the form frac{{y}^{2}}{{b}^{2}}=frac{{x}^{2}}{{a}^{2}}-1 and considering the terms under the square root when solving for y in terms of x, which leads to the asymptotic behavior as x approaches infinity. 2. **Find the coordinates of D and E**: Substituting x=a into the equations of the asymptotes, we get y=pm b. This means the coordinates of D and E are D(a,b) and E(a,-b) respectively. 3. **Calculate the area of triangle ODE**: The area of a triangle with base DE and height OA (where O is the origin) can be calculated as S_{triangle ODE}=frac{1}{2}times text{base} times text{height}. Here, the base is the distance between D and E, which is 2b, and the height is the distance from O to the line x=a, which is a.

Therefore, any sum of three squares modulo (8) must be one of the following: [ 0+0+0 equiv 0 (text{mod} 8) ] [ 0+0+1 equiv 1 (text{mod} 8) ] [ 0+0+4 equiv 4 (text{mod} 8) ] [ 0+1+1 equiv 2 (text{mod} 8) ] [ 0+1+4 equiv 5 (text{mod} 8) ] [ 0+4+4 equiv 0 (text{mod} 8) ] [ 1+1+1 equiv 3 (text{mod} 8) ] [ 1+1+4 equiv 6 (text{mod} 8) ] [ 1+4+4 equiv 1 (text{mod} 8) ] [ 4+4+4 equiv 4 (text{mod} 8) ] Notice that (7 (text{mod} 8)) is not among the possible sums. Therefore, any number of the form (8k + 7) cannot be written as the sum of three squares. Hence, our base case holds (a = 0). 2. **Inductive Step:** Suppose our hypothesis is true for some (a = n), that is, (4^n (8k + 7)) cannot be written as the sum of three squares. We aim to show that it is valid for (a = n+1). Assume for contradiction that there exist integers (x, y,) and (z) such that: [ 4^{n+1}(8k + 7) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 ] Consider the equation modulo (4): [ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 equiv 0 (text{mod} 4) ] Since (x^2, y^2,) and (z^2) are either (0) or (1) modulo (4), the only way their sum can be congruent to (0) modulo (4) is if all three squares are congruent to (0) modulo (4): [ x equiv y equiv z equiv 0 (text{mod} 4) ] This implies (x = 2x'), (y = 2y'), and (z = 2z') for some integers (x', y',) and (z'). Substituting these into our original equation, we get: [ 4^{n+1}(8k + 7) = (2x')^2 + (2y')^2 + (2z')^2 ] [ 4^{n+1}(8k + 7) = 4(x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2) ] [ 4^n (8k + 7) = x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2 ] However, according to our inductive hypothesis, (4^n (8k + 7)) cannot be written as the sum of three squares, which results in a contradiction. 3. **Conclusion:** By induction, we have shown that no number of the form (4^a (8k + 7)) can be written as the sum of three squares for any non-negative integer (a).

(1) Find out how much money is needed to build 1 aboveground parking space and 1 underground parking space each. (2) The relevant department plans to invest 950 million yuan to build these 5000 parking spaces. How many aboveground parking spaces and underground parking spaces can be built?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Cost of Building Parking Spaces Let's denote: - x = cost of building 1 above-ground parking space (in million yuan), - y = cost of building 1 underground parking space (in million yuan). From the given information, we can set up the following system of equations: 1. For 3 above-ground and 2 underground parking spaces costing 0.8 million yuan: 3x + 2y = 0.8. 2. For 2 above-ground and 4 underground parking spaces costing 1.2 million yuan: 2x + 4y = 1.2. Solving this system of equations, we proceed as follows: First, multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to eliminate x: - 6x + 4y = 1.6, - 6x + 12y = 3.6. Subtract the first new equation from the second to solve for y: - 8y = 2 Rightarrow y = 0.25. Substitute y = 0.25 into the first original equation to solve for x: - 3x + 2(0.25) = 0.8 Rightarrow 3x + 0.5 = 0.8 Rightarrow 3x = 0.3 Rightarrow x = 0.1. Thus, the cost to build 1 above-ground parking space is 0.1 million yuan, and the cost to build 1 underground parking space is 0.25 million yuan. Part 2: Number of Parking Spaces to be Built Let: - m = number of underground parking spaces to be built, - 5000 - m = number of above-ground parking spaces to be built. Given the total investment is 950 million yuan, we set up the equation based on the costs found in part 1: - 0.25m + 0.1(5000 - m) = 950. Solving for m: - 0.25m + 500 - 0.1m = 950, - 0.15m = 450, - m = 3000. Therefore, the number of underground parking spaces to be built is 3000, and the number of above-ground parking spaces is 5000 - 3000 = 2000. Final Answer: - Cost to build 1 above-ground parking space: boxed{0.1 text{ million yuan}}, - Cost to build 1 underground parking space: boxed{0.25 text{ million yuan}}, - Number of underground parking spaces to be built: boxed{3000}, - Number of above-ground parking spaces to be built: boxed{2000}."},{"prompt":"A point that is not in the plane area represented by 3x+2y<6 is ( ) A: (0, 0) B: (1, 1) C: (0, 2) D: (2, 0)","completion":"Substitute point (0, 0) into 3x+2y<6, we get 0<6, which obviously holds true, indicating that point (0, 0) is within the area represented by the inequality.

Prove that there is at most one value that the polynomial takes at exactly one integer point.","completion":"1. **Given condition**: It is given that there exists a polynomial P(x) which takes an infinite set of values at least twice at different integer points. 2. **Degree of Polynomial**: From the condition, we infer that P(x) must have a non-zero degree. We may assume without loss of generality that the leading coefficient of P(x) is positive (if not, we can simply change the sign of the polynomial). 3. **Odd and Even Degree**: - If P(x) is of odd degree, then P(x) tends to infty as x to infty and P(x) to -infty as x to -infty. This implies that for sufficiently large lvert x rvert, P(x) will only cross any value a finite number of times. Thus, it can take only finitely many values more than once, contradicting the given condition. Therefore, P(x) has to be of even degree. 4. **Behavior of Polynomial with Even Degree**: - Since P(x) is of even degree and its leading coefficient is positive, it increases as lvert x rvert becomes large. This means that large enough values, where the polynomial is observed at least twice, occur exactly twice. 5. **Considering Values**: Let's arrange these values in an ascending order notation (a_1 < a_2 < ldots) and denote x_k as the larger root and y_k as the smaller root where P(x_k) = P(y_k) = a_k. 6. **Roots and Symmetry Analysis**: - Consider the highest-degree terms of the polynomial P(x) given by P(x) = a_n x^n + b x^{n-1} + ldots. - For any c, the polynomial P(c - x) can be analyzed using its expansion: [ P(c - x) = a_n (c - x)^n + b (c - x)^{n-1} + ldots ] - Expand the highest-order terms: [ P(c - x) = a_n x^n - a_n nc x^{n-1} + b x^{n-1} + ldots = a_n x^n + (-a_n nc - b) x^{n-1} + ldots ] 7. **Coefficients Comparison**: - Note that the coefficients of x^n in both P(x) and P(c - x) are a_n. The coefficients of x^{n-1} match for a specific value of c, denote this c_0 = -frac{2b}{a_n}. - If c > c_0, P(x) - P(c-x) is a polynomial of degree n-1 with a positive leading coefficient, so for large enough x, P(x) > P(c - x). Similarly, if c < c_0, the leading coefficient of P(x) - P(c - x) is negative. 8. **Conclusion About Symmetry**: - For large enough x_k: [ P(x_k) = P(c - x_k) = P(y_k), ] - implies x_k + y_k = c, where c is an integer. Therefore, P(x) = P(c - x) must hold true for all x, indicating that the polynomial is symmetric around x = frac{c}{2}. 9. **Uniqueness of Value at One Point**: - Consequently, the only value that P(x) can take exactly once at an integer point is Pleft(frac{c}{2}right), assuming that frac{c}{2} is an integer. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Proven}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given g(x) = x^2 2ax + 1 has its range as [0, 4] over the interval [1, 3].

Using the given ratios and the total area of ( triangle ABC ), we derive the system of equations: [ left{ begin{array}{l} 2x + y = frac{1}{3} x + 3y = frac{1}{2} end{array} right. ] 4. **Solving the System of Equations:** To find ( x ) and ( y ), we solve the system: - From the first equation: ( 2x + y = frac{1}{3} ) - From the second equation: ( x + 3y = frac{1}{2} ) Multiply the first by 3: [ 6x + 3y = 1 ] Keeping the second unmodified: [ x + 3y = frac{1}{2} ] Subtract the second from the modified first: [ 6x + 3y - (x + 3y) = 1 - frac{1}{2} 5x = frac{1}{2} x = frac{1}{10} ] Substitute ( x = frac{1}{10} ) back into the first equation: [ 2left(frac{1}{10}right) + y = frac{1}{3} frac{2}{10} + y = frac{1}{3} frac{1}{5} + y = frac{1}{3} y = frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{5} y = frac{5}{15} - frac{3}{15} y = frac{2}{15} ] So, ( x = frac{1}{10} ) and ( y = frac{2}{15} ). 5. **Conclusion:** The area of quadrilateral ( PDE ) is given by the sum: [ S_{PDEC} = S_{triangle EDP} + S_{triangle CDP} = frac{1}{10} + frac{2}{15} ] Calculating the sum: [ frac{1}{10} + frac{2}{15} = frac{3}{30} + frac{4}{30} = frac{7}{30} ] Thus, the area of quadrilateral ( PDE ) is: [ boxed{frac{7}{30}} ]"},{"prompt":"James started a food fight in his school's cafeteria, and the school administration is making him work off the cost of all the food he wasted at minimum wage (8).

So, fleft(frac{11pi}{3}right) = 0 + left(-frac{1}{2}right) + left(-frac{1}{2}right) + left(-frac{1}{2}right) = -frac{3}{2}. However, the discrepancy comes from the fact that cos(x) was not correctly evaluated. Let's fix it: cosleft(frac{2pi}{3}right) is indeed -frac{1}{2}, but the subsequent cosine values need to be adjusted since they each represent an additional rotation by 2pi, so they should be the same as cosleft(frac{2pi}{3}right). The correct evaluation is cosleft(frac{5pi}{3}right) = cosleft(frac{2pi}{3} - 2piright) = cosleft(frac{2pi}{3}right) and cosleft(frac{8pi}{3}right) = cosleft(frac{2pi}{3}right). Thus: fleft(frac{11pi}{3}right) = 0 - frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2} = - frac{3}{2} + frac{1}{2} = - frac{1}{2}.

Since he trains twice a day for 4 hours each time, he trains 2 * 4 = 8 hours a day. Now, let's find out how many days a week he trains. We know he trains 2080 hours a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so we can divide the total annual training hours by the number of weeks to find out how many hours he trains per week: 2080 hours/year ÷ 52 weeks/year = 40 hours/week Now we know he trains 40 hours a week. Since he trains 8 hours a day, we can divide the weekly training hours by the daily training hours to find out how many days a week he trains: 40 hours/week ÷ 8 hours/day = 5 days/week This means James trains 5 days a week.

The distributor wants to maintain a 20% profit on the cost of the item, which is 19. Desired profit = 20% of cost Desired profit = 0.20 * 19 Desired profit = 3.80 Now, let's calculate the total desired price for the distributor before the online store's commission. This is the cost of the item plus the desired profit. Total desired price = Cost + Desired profit Total desired price = 19 + 3.80 Total desired price = 22.80 However, this is the price before the online store takes its 20% commission. To find out the final price that the buyer observes online, we need to account for the commission. Let's denote the final price as P. The online store takes 20% of P as commission, so the distributor receives 80% of P. Distributor's revenue = 80% of P Distributor's revenue = 0.80 * P We know that the distributor wants to receive 22.80 after the online store's commission, so we can set up the equation: 0.80 * P = 22.80 Now, we solve for P: P = 22.80 / 0.80 P = 28.50 Therefore, the price that the buyer observes online, which allows the distributor to maintain a 20% profit on the cost of the item after the online store's commission, is boxed{28.50} ."},{"prompt":"Show that if (ABC) is a triangle with points (D) on (BC), (E) on (CA), and (F) on (AB), then the circles (AEF), (BFD), and (CDE) are concurrent.

Consider the given triangle ABC with points D, E, and F on sides BC, CA, and AB, respectively. 2. We need to show that the circumcircles of triangles AEF, BFD, and CDE are concurrent. 3. Let's denote the circumcircles of triangles AEF, BFD, and CDE as omega_1, omega_2, and omega_3, respectively. 4. To establish concurrency, we analyze the angles formed by these circles. **Angle Chasing Method:** 5. Let M be the intersection of circumcircles omega_1 and omega_2 (other than F). We want to show that M also lies on omega_3. 6. First, since M lies on omega_1, we have: [ angle AMF = angle AEF ] 7. Similarly, since M lies on omega_2, we have: [ angle BMF = angle BDF ] 8. Now, consider the triangle CDE. To show that M lies on omega_3, we need: [ angle CME = angle CDE ] 9. We know angle AEF subtends arc AF in omega_1, and angle BDF subtends arc DF in omega_2: [ angle AEF + angle BDF = 180^circ - angle F DE ] This is because angle MDE subtends the opposite arcs, implying: [ angle CME = angle CDE, ] confirming that M also lies on omega_3. **Condition for M on omega:** 10. For M to lie on the circumcircle of ABC, M must be such that: [ angle AMB = angle ACB ] 11. Given that M lies on omega_1, omega_2, and omega_3, this condition holds if and only if D, E\`, and F are collinear (i.e., they lie on a straight line). 12. When D, E, and F are collinear, angles subtended at M by D, E, and F ensure that: [ angle AEF + angle BDF + angle CDE = 180^circ ] This occurs only if D, E, and F form a straight line intersecting the arc paths fitting M naturally on ABC. # Conclusion The geometric properties indicate that the point M belongs to the circle ABC if and only if D, E, and F are aligned. Therefore, we have shown both requirements and conditions for the point of concurrency and alignment within the circle. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Which of the following groups of objects can form a set? ① Beautiful birds; ② Nonnegative integers not exceeding 10; ③ Positive numbers whose cubes are close to zero; ④ Firstyear high school students with relatively good eyesight.

Evaluating f(x) at the point of tangency, we have f(2) = 2^3 - 6 cdot 2^2 + 21 cdot 2 + b = 0. Solving for b, we find b = -26. Therefore, the expression for f(x) is as follows: f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 21x - 26. (2) To ensure f(x) < 9x + k, we must have k > f(x) - 9x = x^3 - 6x^2 + 12x - 26. Let g(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 12x - 26 and compute its derivative, g'(x) = 3(x^2 - 4x + 4) = 3(x - 2)^2. Since (x - 2)^2 > 0 for x in (2,5), it follows that g(x) is strictly increasing on this interval.

Since h'(x) > 0 for all x > 1, h(x) is monotonically increasing on (1, +infty). Evaluating h(x) at x=1 gives: h(1) = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2} - ln 1 = 0.

Please write down an analytical expression for the function that satisfies the conditions: f(x) = ____.","completion":"To solve for f(x) given the conditions f(-x) = f(x) and f(2-x) + f(x) = 0, we proceed as follows: 1. **Symmetry about the y-axis**: The condition f(-x) = f(x) implies that the function is even, meaning it is symmetric about the y-axis. This is because for every x, the value of f(x) is the same as f(-x). 2. **Symmetry about the point (1,0)**: The condition f(2-x) + f(x) = 0 can be interpreted as the function having a center of symmetry at the point (1,0). This is because if you take a point x and its 'mirror' point 2-x (which is the same distance from 1 but on the opposite side), their function values add up to 0, indicating symmetry about the vertical line x=1. 3. **Periodicity**: Combining these symmetries, we deduce that the function must have a period of 4. This is because the symmetry about the y-axis (f(-x) = f(x)) and the symmetry about the point (1,0) (f(2-x) + f(x) = 0) together imply that the function repeats its values in intervals of 4 units along the x-axis. 4. **Example of such a function**: A function that is both even and has a period of 4 is cosleft(frac{pi}{2}xright). This function is even because cos(-theta) = cos(theta), and it has a period of 4 because cosleft(frac{pi}{2}(x+4)right) = cosleft(frac{pi}{2}x + 2piright) = cosleft(frac{pi}{2}xright), where we use the fact that the cosine function has a period of 2pi. Therefore, an analytical expression for the function that satisfies the given conditions is: [ f(x) = cosleft(frac{pi}{2}xright) ] However, it's important to note that this solution is not unique. Any function that is even and has a period of 4 will satisfy the given conditions. Thus, the answer provided is an example of such a function, but not the only possible solution.

Both triangles share the side KC, and CM = CA', as both are radii of the circle centered at C. 3. To confirm the equality of the angles angle KCM and angle KCA', observe: - The angle varphi = angle BCK is an inscribed angle subtended by the shorter arc BK of the circle centered at A. - The angle angle ACM is central angle subtended by the arc AM of the circle centered at C, which also subtends the same arc AM; hence angle ACM = 2varphi. - Therefore, angle KCA' = 60^{circ} - varphi, and angle KCM = 60^{circ} + varphi. 4.

Let x yuan be the original price per bottle. During the May Day holiday promotion, each bottle is sold at a 10% discount, which means each bottle is sold at 0.9x yuan. Given that buying one box at 36 yuan gets you two extra bottles for free, we can set up the equations to find the original price per bottle and the number of bottles per box. 1. **Equation for the Price Discount**: The problem states that the promotion is equivalent to selling each bottle at a 10% discount. We can express this as two equations based on the information given: - frac{36}{0.9x} - frac{36}{x} = 2 - 0.9(36 + 2x) = 36 Solving the first equation for x gives us the relationship between the original price per bottle and the discounted price.

Therefore: [ a^2 equiv 0 text{ or } 1 pmod{3} ] Since ( 3b^2 - 1 ) must also be 0 or 1 modulo 3, consider: - if ( b^2 equiv 0 pmod{3} ), then ( 3b^2 equiv 0 pmod{3} implies 3b^2 - 1 equiv -1 notequiv 0, 1 pmod{3} ) - if ( b^2 equiv 1 pmod{3} ), then ( 3b^2 equiv 3 pmod{3} implies 3b^2 - 1 equiv 2 - 1 equiv 1 notequiv 0, 1 pmod{3} ) This shows that ( a^2 = 3b^2 - 1 ) is not possible because it contradicts the properties of squares modulo 3. 4. **Conclude that only Case 1 is valid**: After ruling out case 2, we are left with: [ n = 3a^2 quad text{and} quad n+1 = b^2 ] 5. **Verify the properties given in the problem statement**: - If ( n = 3a^2 ), then ( n ) is clearly a multiple of 3. - We were given ( n+1 = b^2 ), so ( n+1 ) is a perfect square by definition. - Finally, since ( n = 3a^2 ), we are left to show that ( frac{n}{3} = a^2 ), which is indeed a perfect square. # Conclusion: Therefore, we have shown that if ( frac{n(n+1)}{3} ) is a square, then: - ( n ) is a multiple of 3, - ( n+1 ) is a square, - ( frac{n}{3} ) is a square.

The conversion factor from km/hr to m/s is: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s So, the train's speed in m/s is: 45 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 12.5 m/s Now, we can calculate the distance the train travels in 30 seconds at this speed: Distance = Speed * Time Distance = 12.5 m/s * 30 s = 375 meters This distance is the combined length of the train and the bridge.

Note that this matrix should be symmetric (i.e., ((i, j))-th element is the same as ((j, i))-th element). This is because if the (i)-th street intersects with the (j)-th street, then naturally the (j)-th street intersects with the (i)-th street. 5. Now if each street intersects with exactly three other streets, the sum of the elements in each row (or equivalently, each column) must be 3. Therefore, the number of \`1\`s in each row is 3. 6. Consequently, if each of the 7 rows has exactly 3 \`1\`s, the total number of \`1\`s in the matrix is: [ 7 cdot 3 = 21 ] 7. However, since the matrix is symmetric, the total number of \`1\`s (which represents the street intersections) must be even. This is because each intersection is counted twice (once at ((i, j)) and once at ((j, i))). 8.

Our goal is to show that lines ( AA_1, BB_1, CC_1, DD_1, ) and ( EE_1 ) all pass through a single point. 4. First, we need to establish that certain pairs of these lines are parallel. Consider triangle ( ABD ). The median from vertex ( D ) to the opposite side ( AB ) is segment ( DD_1 ), splitting ( triangle ABD ) into two triangles of equal area: [ t_{ADD_1} = t_{BDD_1} ] 5.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Nick to clean the entire house alone. We know that John cleans the entire house in 6 hours, so his rate is 1/6 of the house per hour. When John and Nick work together, they take 3.6 hours to clean the entire house. The combined rate of John and Nick is 1/3.6 of the house per hour. The combined rate is the sum of their individual rates, so we can write the equation: 1/6 + 1/N = 1/3.6 where N is the time it takes for Nick to clean the entire house alone.

Since they each earned 5, the total amount earned is 5 + 5 = 10. Now, let's convert the total amount earned into cents, since each circle costs 1 cent. 10 is equal to 1000 cents (since 1 = 100 cents). Next, let's calculate the total number of circles from the single, double, and triple pieces and their corresponding value in cents: - Single pieces: 100 pieces * 1 circle/piece = 100 circles - Double pieces: 45 pieces * 2 circles/piece = 90 circles - Triple pieces: 50 pieces * 3 circles/piece = 150 circles Now, let's add up the total number of circles from these pieces: 100 circles (single) + 90 circles (double) + 150 circles (triple) = 340 circles The value in cents for these circles is the same as the number of circles, so they earned 340 cents from these pieces. Now, let's subtract the value of these circles from the total amount earned to find out how much was earned from the quadruple pieces: 1000 cents (total) - 340 cents (single, double, triple) = 660 cents Since each quadruple piece has 4 circles, we divide the remaining cents by 4 to find the number of quadruple pieces sold: 660 cents / 4 circles/piece = 165 quadruple pieces Therefore, Michael and Thomas sold boxed{165} quadruple pieces."},{"prompt":"On rainy mornings, Mo drinks exactly n cups of hot chocolate (assume that n is an integer).

I recommend starting by visiting the official Unity website and Game Objects for resources and detailed documentation. Alternatively, tutorials can be found on YouTube, Udemy, and other online platforms."},{"prompt":"Can you point out some guidelines?","completion":"Certainly! Here are some general guidelines to keep in mind when developing a tower defense game in Unity using C#: 1. Plan your game mechanics and design your levels before you begin coding. 2. Create a variety of unique towers with different strengths and weaknesses. 3. Design visually appealing enemy units with different abilities. 4. Implement a variety of upgrades for towers and enemies. 5. Create a user interface for the player to monitor gameplay and tower placement. 6. Implement a scoring system to keep track of the player's performance. 7. Make sure to test your game thoroughly and iterate on feedback. 8. Optimize your game to ensure it runs smoothly on different devices. 9. Consider adding sound effects and background music to enhance the player's experience. 10. Consider implementing AI pathfinding algorithms to enable enemies to find their way around obstacles and defenses. These are just a few general guidelines to follow, and there may be other considerations specific to your game that you need to keep in mind as well. Good luck with your tower defense game development!"},{"prompt":"can you write C# code to manage the path enemies should follow?","completion":"Sure, I can provide you with a sample C# code implementation for pathfinding in a tower defense game for Unity. Here is an example using A* (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm: \`\`\` using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; public class EnemyPathfinding : MonoBehaviour { // The target position for this enemy to reach public Transform target; // The grid representing the game world public Grid grid; // The path this enemy will follow private List<Node> path; // The current node on the path this enemy is headed for private int currentWaypointIndex = 0; // The speed at which this enemy moves public float speed = 5f; void Update () { // Check if we have a path to follow if (path != null) { // Check if we have arrived at the current waypoint if (Vector3.Distance(transform.position, path[currentWaypointIndex].worldPosition) < 0.1f) { // Move to the next waypoint on the path currentWaypointIndex++; // Check if we have reached the end of the path if (currentWaypointIndex >= path.Count) { // We've reached our destination, so destroy this enemy object Destroy(gameObject); // TODO: Remove health/lives from player } } // If there is still a path to follow, continue moving towards the next waypoint if (currentWaypointIndex < path.Count) { transform.position = Vector3.MoveTowards(transform.position, path[currentWaypointIndex].worldPosition, speed * Time.deltaTime); } } } // Called when this enemy spawns/appears public void Spawn() { // Get the nearest node to this enemy's starting position Node startNode = grid.GetNearestNode(transform.position); // Get the nearest node to our destination target Node endNode = grid.GetNearestNode(target.position); // Calculate the shortest path from the start to end node using A* path = AStar.FindPath(startNode, endNode); } } \`\`\` In this example, we have created an \`EnemyPathfinding\` script that you can attach to your enemy game object. The \`EnemyPathfinding\` script takes care of managing the path that the enemy should follow to reach the player's base. First, the script gets the start and end nodes using \`grid.GetNearestNode()\` method. The \`grid\` refers to the game grid representing the game world which is assumed to be already defined. The \`AStar\` refers to the A* pathfinding algorithm (not included in this code) that performs pathfinding on the grid to compute the shortest path from the start node to the end node. Then, in the Update function, the script checks if there is a path to follow. If there is, it checks if the enemy has arrived at the current waypoint of the path. If so, it advances to the next waypoint. If the enemy has reached the last waypoint, the enemy reaches its destination, and it destroys itself. Finally, the script checks if it hasn't reached the last waypoint, it continues to move towards the next waypoint. The \`currentWaypointIndex\` keeps track of the current target node to move towards. To use this script, you would need to have a \`Grid\` class that defines a grid of \`Node\`s that cover the game world and a specific implementation of the A* algorithm that computes a path through that grid. Hope this helps!"},{"prompt":"can you code some sample towers with different abilities?","completion":"Sure! Here's a sample C# code for two different types of towers that possess different abilities: \`\`\` using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; public enum TowerType { Basic, Splash } public class Tower : MonoBehaviour { public TowerType towerType; public float range; public float damage; public float cooldown; public GameObject projectilePrefab; public Transform firePoint; private float lastFiredTime; void Update() { // Check if it's time to fire if (Time.time - lastFiredTime > cooldown) { // Find and shoot at the nearest enemy Enemy nearestEnemy = FindNearestEnemy(); if (nearestEnemy != null) { lastFiredTime = Time.time; // update the last firing time if (towerType == TowerType.Basic) { // for basic type tower ShootBasic(nearestEnemy); } else { // for splash type tower ShootSplash(nearestEnemy); } } } } public void ShootSplash(Enemy target) { // This method is only for the splash type tower // Instantiate projectile and deal splash damage to the target and enemies around it GameObject projectileGO = Instantiate(projectilePrefab, firePoint.position, Quaternion.identity); Projectile projectile = projectileGO.GetComponent<Projectile>(); projectile.target = target; projectile.damage = damage; projectile.doSplashDamage = true; } public void ShootBasic(Enemy target) { // This method is only for the basic type tower // Instantiate projectile and deal damage only to the target GameObject projectileGO = Instantiate(projectilePrefab, firePoint.position, Quaternion.identity); Projectile projectile = projectileGO.GetComponent<Projectile>(); projectile.target = target; projectile.damage = damage; } public Enemy FindNearestEnemy() { // Find all enemies within range List<Enemy> enemiesInRange = new List<Enemy>(); foreach (GameObject enemyGO in GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag(\\"Enemy\\")) { Enemy enemy = enemyGO.GetComponent<Enemy>(); if (Vector3.Distance(transform.position, enemy.transform.position) <= range) { enemiesInRange.Add(enemy); } } // Find the enemy nearest to the tower Enemy nearestEnemy = null; float nearestEnemyDistance = Mathf.Infinity; foreach (Enemy enemy in enemiesInRange) { float distance = Vector3.Distance(transform.position, enemy.transform.position); if (distance < nearestEnemyDistance) { nearestEnemyDistance = distance; nearestEnemy = enemy; } } return nearestEnemy; } } \`\`\` In this example, we have created a \`Tower\` script that you can attach to your tower game object. The \`Tower\` script takes care of shooting projectiles at enemies within range. The \`Tower\` script has two types of towers: \`Basic\` type and \`Splash\` type. The \`Basic\` type tower shoots projectiles that can deal damage to only a single enemy at a time. The \`Splash\` type tower shoots projectiles that can deal splash damage to the targeted enemy as well as enemies around it. The \`Update\` method checks if it is time to fire a projectile at the nearest enemy. If so, it checks if the tower is of the \`Basic\` or \`Splash\` type and calls the appropriate \`Shoot\` method. The \`Shoot\` methods themselves instantiate a \`Projectile\` and deal appropriate damage to the enemy. For the \`Splash\` type, it also deals splash damage to the enemies that are close enough to the targeted enemy. The \`FindNearestEnemy\` method calculates the distance of all the enemies within the range of the tower, and then selects the nearest enemy for the tower to target. This is just an example to get you started, and you can modify the properties, damage formula, and other configurations of your towers according to your needs."},{"prompt":"can you code a sample for drag and drop in unity?","completion":"Yes, sure! Here is a sample C# code that you can use for implementing drag and drop functionality in your Unity game: \`\`\` using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.EventSystems; public class DragAndDrop : MonoBehaviour, IPointerDownHandler, IBeginDragHandler, IEndDragHandler, IDragHandler { private Canvas canvas; private RectTransform rect; private CanvasGroup canvasGroup; private Vector2 initialPosition; private void Awake() { rect = GetComponent<RectTransform>(); canvas = GetComponentInParent<Canvas>(); canvasGroup = GetComponent<CanvasGroup>(); } public void OnPointerDown(PointerEventData eventData) { initialPosition = transform.position; } public void OnBeginDrag(PointerEventData eventData) { canvasGroup.blocksRaycasts = false; } public void OnDrag(PointerEventData eventData) { rect.anchoredPosition += eventData.delta / canvas.scaleFactor; } public void OnEndDrag(PointerEventData eventData) { canvasGroup.blocksRaycasts = true; if (!eventData.pointerEnter) { transform.position = initialPosition; return; } DragAndDrop dest = eventData.pointerEnter.GetComponent<DragAndDrop>(); if (dest != null) { // if it's dropped onto another object with DragAndDrop script // do something when dropped onto the destination object } else { // return to initial position transform.position = initialPosition; } } } \`\`\` In this example, we have created a \`DragAndDrop\` script that you can attach to any game object you would like to drag and drop. The \`Awake\` method caches the \`RectTransform\`, \`Canvas\`, and \`CanvasGroup\` components as they will not change throughout the lifetime of the game object. The implemented \`OnPointerDown\`, \`OnBeginDrag\`, \`OnDrag\`, and \`OnEndDrag\` methods are a part of the \`IBeginDragHandler\`, \`IDragHandler\`, \`IEndDragHandler\`, and \`IPointerDownHandler\` interfaces, respectively, that allow us to interact with the \`PointerEventData\` and determine the actions necessary to be taken when the user triggers a particular event. The \`OnPointerDown\` method records the initial position of the object before dragging. When the user starts dragging the object, the \`OnBeginDrag\` method disables the \`blocksRaycasts\` setting when dragging so that other UI elements beneath this dragged object receive input. The \`OnDrag\` method is called every frame while dragging, and it updates the position of the game object. Finally, once the user releases the drag, the \`OnEndDrag\` is called. It checks if the user dragged onto another game object that has the \`DragAndDrop\` script, and then takes appropriate action. I hope this helps you to create the drag and drop functionality you were looking for in your Unity game."},{"prompt":"Дэвид Юм кратко","completion":"Дэвид Юм (1711-1776) – шотландский философ, представитель эпохи Просвещения.

Here is an example: \`\`\` import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget { @override _MyWidgetState createState() => _MyWidgetState(); } class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> with WidgetsBindingObserver { @override void initState() { super.initState(); WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this); } @override void dispose() { WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this); super.dispose(); } @override void didBuild() { // Widget is fully rendered } @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return Container(); } } \`\`\` In this example, the MyWidget stateful widget implements the WidgetsBindingObserver and overrides the didBuild method. The initState method adds the widget as an observer of the WidgetsBinding instance, and the dispose method removes it. 2. Using the addPostFrameCallback method Another way to detect when a widget is fully rendered is to use the addPostFrameCallback method of the BuildContext class. This method adds a callback to the frame schedule to be called after the current frame is drawn. Here is an example: \`\`\` import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((timeStamp) { // Widget is fully rendered }); return Container(); } } \`\`\` In this example, the addPostFrameCallback method is called in the build method of the widget. The callback function passed to this method will be called after the widget is fully rendered."},{"prompt":"how to get widget context without globalkey?","completion":"There are multiple ways to get the context of a widget without using a GlobalKey. Here are some of them: 1. Using the BuildContext Of Parent Widget: One of the easiest ways to get the context of a widget is by using the BuildContext of its parent widget. You can simply pass the context of the parent widget as an argument in the constructor of the child widget and use it in the child widget to access the context. \`\`\` class ChildWidget extends StatelessWidget { final BuildContext parentContext; ChildWidget(this.parentContext); @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return RaisedButton( onPressed: (){ // use parentContext here Scaffold.of(parentContext).showSnackBar( SnackBar( content: Text(\\"Hello\\"), ), ); }, ); } } \`\`\` 2. Using the Navigator: If the widget is a screen/page, then you can use the Navigator to get the context. You can use the Navigator's navigatorKey to access the context of a screen. \`\`\` class MyPage extends StatefulWidget { final GlobalKey<NavigatorState> navigatorKey; const MyPage({Key? key, required this.navigatorKey}) : super(key: key); @override _MyPageState createState() => _MyPageState(); } class _MyPageState extends State<MyPage> { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return Scaffold( body: Center( child: RaisedButton( onPressed: (){ // use widget.navigatorKey.currentContext here Scaffold.of(widget.navigatorKey.currentContext).showSnackBar( SnackBar( content: Text(\\"Hello\\"), ), ); }, ), ), ); } } \`\`\` 3. Using the InheritedWidget: You can also use an InheritedWidget to pass a context down the widget tree. An InheritedWidget is a widget that propagates data down the widget tree to its children and can be accessed by any of its descendant widgets. \`\`\` class MyInheritedWidget extends InheritedWidget { final BuildContext widgetContext; MyInheritedWidget({required this.widgetContext, required Widget child}) : super(child: child); static MyInheritedWidget of(BuildContext context) { return context.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType<MyInheritedWidget>()!; } @override bool updateShouldNotify(covariant InheritedWidget oldWidget) => true; } class ChildWidget extends StatelessWidget { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { final myInheritedWidget = MyInheritedWidget.of(context); return RaisedButton( onPressed: (){ // use myInheritedWidget.widgetContext here Scaffold.of(myInheritedWidget.widgetContext).showSnackBar( SnackBar( content: Text(\\"Hello\\"), ), ); }, ); } } class ParentWidget extends StatelessWidget { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return MyInheritedWidget( widgetContext: context, child: ChildWidget(), ); } } \`\`\` In this example, the context of the ParentWidget is passed down using an InheritedWidget, which can be accessed by the ChildWidget using the static of() method. The widgetContext property of the MyInheritedWidget is the context of the ParentWidget."},{"prompt":"Текст: \\" (1)Тот, кто любит искусство истинно, кто любит поэзию, литературу, — не должен искусственно ограничивать себя только одной сферой и пребывать в полном равнодушии к музыке, к танцу, к изображению… (2)Человеку свойственно всестороннее, гармоническое развитие интересов и вкусов.

Hovering nearby is her exasperated nurse, LUCIANA VIPARI (early 30s, no-nonsense demeanor). LORETTA (V.O.) Before all this happened, I was a force to be reckoned with. A brilliant mind. A sexy, free spirit. But now... A drool drips down LORETTA'S chin. She doesn't notice. LORETTA (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...I'm just a prisoner in my own body. Well, that's what I want them to think, at least.

Knowledge is power, and my body being as good as useless has protected me from their wrath... So far. LORETTA mumbles something unintelligible, almost whining in her discomfort.

I need to find a way to pass the information I have onto someone else, without Luciana noticing. Or worse, them finding out that I'm not as incapacitated as I seem. As LORETTA tries to maneuver her wheelchair closer to the TV in a seemingly awkward attempt, LUCIANA finishes the diaper change and looks at her with frustration. LUCIANA You can't keep doing this on your own, Loretta. I'm here to help you. LORETTA (V.O.) Sorry, Luciana. I don't want to be a burden, and I wish I could tell you the truth.

I need... water... LUCIANA (O.S.) Hold on, Loretta. I'll get you some water in a minute. Quickly, LORETTA finishes the note and starts hiding it near the edge of the table, still trying to make it seem as if she's struggling with basic motor skills. LORETTA (V.O.) Let's hope this works.

Главой королевства был Король Томас, который был очень любим и уважаем своими подданными. Он справедливо правил королевством со своей Кошечкой - Королевой Елизаветой - рядом. Однажды, в королевстве появилась Метла, кошка-колдунья, которая обитала в лесу вне города. Ходили слухи, что Метла приносит всё плохое в королевство и что король Томас справедливо посылал своих лучших рыцарей сражаться с Метлой. Рыцари вновь и вновь просили короля дать разрешение на авантюру, и он согласился. Глава 2: Рыцарь-путешественник Одним из лучших рыцарей, отправленных на задание, был юный Вильям. Он был молод и стремительный, его любовь к правде и справедливости продиктовали ему его работу. Он направился на поиски Метлы, сражался со всеми опасностями леса и наконец нашел котку-колдунью.

Вместо того, чтобы приносить зло, Метла пыталась защитить королевство от тайных врагов, которых король Томас никогда не видел своими глазами. Она объяснила юному рыцарю, что она не могла говорить с королем Томасом из-за его перепалки с Кошечкой. Глава 4: Доказательство Метлы Вильям и Метла решили пойти к королю Томасу и показать ему истину. Они нашли короля Томаса и объяснили ему, что Метла на самом деле пытается защищать и спасти королевство. Король был изумлен, потому что он никогда не знал о тайных угрозах, которые исходили из леса. Он был тронут трудами рыцаря-путешественника и благодарен Метле за ее защиту.

Je tiens à vous féliciter pour les améliorations significatives que vous avez apportées dans la nouvelle version de votre service de messagerie web. Les performances et la facilité d'utilisation ont grandement progressé, et il est clair que vous avez tenu compte des retours de vos utilisateurs pour rendre ce produit encore plus performant. La nouvelle interface est bien plus conviviale et agréable à utiliser, en particulier grâce à la réorganisation des menus et aux nouvelles options de personnalisation. De plus, je note avec plaisir que la réactivité et la stabilité du service se sont améliorées, ce qui rend l'expérience globale encore plus agréable. Cependant, malgré toutes ces avancées, il y a encore quelques fonctionnalités qui manquent et qui, selon moi, pourraient rendre votre service de messagerie encore plus complet. Une de ces fonctionnalités est la possibilité d'importer des fichiers EML, qui permettrait à vos utilisateurs de conserver facilement leurs e-mails lorsqu'ils migrent vers votre service depuis une autre plateforme de messagerie. En outre, je pense que la possibilité d'obtenir des accusés de réception serait une fonctionnalité très utile pour les professionnels de divers secteurs d'activités. Ce type de confirmation est indispensable pour s'assurer que les messages importants ont bien été reçus par leur destinataire et pour éviter toute incompréhension ou problème de communication. Je comprends que le développement de nouvelles fonctionnalités peut prendre du temps, mais je vous encourage à envisager d'ajouter ces deux options à votre road map. Je suis convaincu qu'elles participeraient grandement à améliorer l'expérience utilisateur et à renforcer la compétitivité de votre service de messagerie sur le marché. Encore une fois, je tiens à vous féliciter pour le travail accompli et les améliorations notables de votre nouvelle version.

I wanted to congratulate you on the significant improvements you have made in the new version of your webmail service. The performance and ease of use have greatly advanced, and it is clear that you have considered the feedback of your users to make this product even more effective. The new interface is much more user-friendly and enjoyable to use, particularly due to the reorganization of menus and the new customization options. Moreover, I am pleased to note that the responsiveness and stability of the service have improved, which makes the overall experience even more pleasant. However, despite all these advancements, there are still some features that are missing and that, in my opinion, could make your email service even more comprehensive. One such feature is the ability to import EML files, which would allow your users to easily retain their emails when migrating to your service from another email platform. In addition, I believe that the ability to receive return receipts would be a very useful feature for professionals in various industries. This type of confirmation is essential to ensure that important messages have been received by their intended recipients and to avoid any misunderstandings or communication issues. I understand that developing new features can take time, but I encourage you to consider adding these two options to your roadmap. I am confident that they would greatly contribute to improving the user experience and strengthening the competitiveness of your email service in the market.

(3)И я даже как-то не представляю себе человека, который любил бы серьезную музыку и оставался бы глух к поэзии Пушкина, Блока, Маяковского, никогда не читал бы Толстого, Чехова… (4)Или страстного знатока литературы, поэзии, который не бывал в Эрмитаже, Третьяковской галерее, в Русском музее. (5)Не очень поверю я в его любовь к стихам: стихи полны впечатлении от полотен великих художников, от ландшафтов России, от городов мира… (6)Где найти чудака, который изучает Шекспира, а в театре никогда не бывал? (7)Уж кто его любит, не пропустит «Гамлета» ни в театре, ни на экране. (8)Даже тот, кто не обладает активным музыкальным слухом, если он человек культурный по-настоящему, он ходит на концерты, слушает музыку в записи или по радио.

(11)По счастью, каждый, развивший в себе способности воспринимать искусство, не ограничивает себя какой-то одной областью (если даже он профессионально работает в ней), а, наоборот, стремится как можно больше узнать и ощутить эту благотворную связь искусств между собой. (12)Разве наше представление о Пушкине ограничивается его сочинениями? (13)Нет! Мы не можем назвать почти ни одного большого русского композитора, который не создал бы оперы на пушкинский текст, не положил бы на музыку пушкинские стихи. (14)О Глинке мы уже говорили. Даргомыжский написал на текст Пушкина «Русалку», Мусоргский — народную драму «Борис Годунов». (15)Римский-Корсаков — «Сказку о царе Салтане», «Моцарта и Сальери», «Золотого петушка», Чайковский — «Онегина», «Пиковую даму», «Мазепу», Рахманинов — «Алеко», Асафьев — балет «Бахчисарайский фонтан», Глиэр — «Медного всадника»… (16)Пушкинские сюжеты в изобразительном искусстве составляют целую пушкиниану, которую начинают такие художники, как Брюллов, Репин, Врубель… (17)Какие вдохновенные иллюстрации к «Маленьким трагедням» Пушкина создал выдающийся советский гравер Фаворский! (18)И отличные иллюстрации к «Борису Годунову» — Е. Кибрик. (19)А облик самого Пушкина! (20)Памятник работы скульптора Опекушина на Пушкинской площади в Москве. (21)Памятник в Ленинграде, не так давно созданный скульптором Аникушиным: вдохновенное изображение Пушкина в момент вдохновенного чтения стихов — разве это не продолжение пушкинской темы в искусстве? (22)А исполнение стихов Пушкина и его прозы… (23)Ильинский Игорь Владимирович «рассказывает» «Золотого петушка» так, что пушкинская сказка начинает сверкать новыми красками — чистыми, звонкими, радует тонким юмором, остротой, сатирой на царей и их приближенных. (24)А разве воплощенный Шаляпиным образ Бориса в опере Мусоргского не продолжение Пушкина? (25)Или шаляпинский Мельник в «Русалке»? (26)А шаляпинский Сальери? (27)Каждый, кого интересует не только отдельное произведение, но и совокупность впечатлений, которое составляет понятие «культура», каждый культурный человек стремится воспринять все грани искусства, все его сущности, или, как еще говорят, ипостаси. (28)Знакомство с искусством, поэзией, с литературой вызывает стремление не только воспринимать прекрасное, но и многое знать об этом прекрасном и о том, кем оно создано, как создано, когда. (29)Рождается желание глубоко постигнуть, осмыслить и сопоставить одно явление с другим. (30)Отсюда наш интерес к истории искусства, литературы. (31)Интерес к биографии создателей гениальных творений. (32)К процессу их творчества, к той эпохе, в которую они жили. (33)Разрозненные впечатления соединяются в общую картину культуры. (34)Каждому явлению отводится свое место. (35)И каждое оценивается не только само по себе, но и в сопоставлении с другими. (36)Значительное, великое мы научаемся отличать от пошлого и от преходящего.

Заключение","completion":"В тексте \\"Любовь к искусству\\" Ираклий Андроников поставил проблему о том, что настоящий любитель искусства должен охватывать все его сферы, чтобы получить полное представление о нём. Позиция автора заключается в мысли о том, что только глубокое знакомство с искусством на всех уровнях и формах позволяет человеку понять сущность и влияние искусства на людей и оценивать его настоящее и будущее значение. Примером-иллюстрацией этой проблемы может служить факт о том, что многие известные композиторы создавали оперы и произведения на тексты Пушкина, такие как Чайковский (\\"Онегин\\"), Римский-Корсаков (\\"Сказка о царе Салтане\\"), Мусоргский (\\"Борис Годунов\\"). Это демонстрирует, что эстетические понятия переплетены между собой и взаимодействуют, что отличает настоящих любителей и искушенных знатоков. Другим примером-иллюстрацией является упоминание о том, что человек, который не бывал в музеях или театрах, никогда не сможет настоящим образом понять значение искусства и его воздействия на людей. Этот пример подчёркивает неполноту и поверхностность восприятия из культурной жизни, что напрямую противоречит идеям любителя искусства. Примеры-иллюстрации взаимосвязаны, так как они дополняются друг друга. Они не только демонстрируют значимость многогранности на произведения искусства, но и подчёркивают, что их отсутствие может привести к нежелательным последствиям. Я согласен с автором, что охватывать все сферы и формы искусства важно для понимания его смысла и сущности. Для того, чтобы получить полное искусствоведческое образование, нужно погружаться в разные стили, эпохи, жанры и формы, посещая концерты, театры, музеи, читая литературу и примеряя все это на себя.

(3)И я даже как-то не представляю себе человека, который любил бы серьезную музыку и оставался бы глух к поэзии Пушкина, Блока, Маяковского, никогда не читал бы Толстого, Чехова… (4)Или страстного знатока литературы, поэзии, который не бывал в Эрмитаже, Третьяковской галерее, в Русском музее. (5)Не очень поверю я в его любовь к стихам: стихи полны впечатлении от полотен великих художников, от ландшафтов России, от городов мира… (6)Где найти чудака, который изучает Шекспира, а в театре никогда не бывал? (7)Уж кто его любит, не пропустит «Гамлета» ни в театре, ни на экране. (8)Даже тот, кто не обладает активным музыкальным слухом, если он человек культурный по-настоящему, он ходит на концерты, слушает музыку в записи или по радио. (9)Как можно добровольно отказаться от величайших ценностей, накопленных человечеством? (10)Как можно без них правильно судить об искусстве и о его воздействии на людей? (11)По счастью, каждый, развивший в себе способности воспринимать искусство, не ограничивает себя какой-то одной областью (если даже он профессионально работает в ней), а, наоборот, стремится как можно больше узнать и ощутить эту благотворную связь искусств между собой. (12)Разве наше представление о Пушкине ограничивается его сочинениями? (13)Нет! Мы не можем назвать почти ни одного большого русского композитора, который не создал бы оперы на пушкинский текст, не положил бы на музыку пушкинские стихи. (14)О Глинке мы уже говорили. Даргомыжский написал на текст Пушкина «Русалку», Мусоргский — народную драму «Борис Годунов». (15)Римский-Корсаков — «Сказку о царе Салтане», «Моцарта и Сальери», «Золотого петушка», Чайковский — «Онегина», «Пиковую даму», «Мазепу», Рахманинов — «Алеко», Асафьев — балет «Бахчисарайский фонтан», Глиэр — «Медного всадника»… (16)Пушкинские сюжеты в изобразительном искусстве составляют целую пушкиниану, которую начинают такие художники, как Брюллов, Репин, Врубель… (17)Какие вдохновенные иллюстрации к «Маленьким трагедням» Пушкина создал выдающийся советский гравер Фаворский! (18)И отличные иллюстрации к «Борису Годунову» — Е. Кибрик. (19)А облик самого Пушкина! (20)Памятник работы скульптора Опекушина на Пушкинской площади в Москве. (21)Памятник в Ленинграде, не так давно созданный скульптором Аникушиным: вдохновенное изображение Пушкина в момент вдохновенного чтения стихов — разве это не продолжение пушкинской темы в искусстве? (22)А исполнение стихов Пушкина и его прозы… (23)Ильинский Игорь Владимирович «рассказывает» «Золотого петушка» так, что пушкинская сказка начинает сверкать новыми красками — чистыми, звонкими, радует тонким юмором, остротой, сатирой на царей и их приближенных. (24)А разве воплощенный Шаляпиным образ Бориса в опере Мусоргского не продолжение Пушкина? (25)Или шаляпинский Мельник в «Русалке»? (26)А шаляпинский Сальери? (27)Каждый, кого интересует не только отдельное произведение, но и совокупность впечатлений, которое составляет понятие «культура», каждый культурный человек стремится воспринять все грани искусства, все его сущности, или, как еще говорят, ипостаси. (28)Знакомство с искусством, поэзией, с литературой вызывает стремление не только воспринимать прекрасное, но и многое знать об этом прекрасном и о том, кем оно создано, как создано, когда. (29)Рождается желание глубоко постигнуть, осмыслить и сопоставить одно явление с другим. (30)Отсюда наш интерес к истории искусства, литературы. (31)Интерес к биографии создателей гениальных творений. (32)К процессу их творчества, к той эпохе, в которую они жили. (33)Разрозненные впечатления соединяются в общую картину культуры. (34)Каждому явлению отводится свое место. (35)И каждое оценивается не только само по себе, но и в сопоставлении с другими. (36)Значительное, великое мы научаемся отличать от пошлого и от преходящего. (37)Великие творения слушаем, смотрим и перечитываем не раз и не два. (38)И с каждым разом находим в них все больше красот. * Ираклий Луарсабович Андроников (1908–1990) – советский писатель, литературовед.\\" Задание: Напишите сочинение по прочитанному тексту.

Андроникова \\"О любви к искусству\\" основная проблема заключается в необходимости гармонического развития интересов и вкусов каждого человека при восприятии искусства. Автор считает, что искусство является комплексным явлением, и любой человек, интересующийся им, должен воспринимать его во всей полноте. Примером-иллюстрацией может служить упоминание об отношении к поэзии и литературе без ценности к изобразительному искусству, музыке или танцу. Автор указывает на то, что поэзия полна впечатлений от полотен великих художников и от городов мира. Искушенный читатель, который не ищет ограничений, воспринимает всю многообразную красоту мира, пронизанную искусством. Еще один пример-иллюстрация – это упоминание о том, что оперы, созданные на тексты Пушкина, написаны практически всеми великими русскими композиторами. Это доказывает связь между искусствами и необходимость их всестороннего восприятия. Автор полагает, что каждый культурный человек должен стремиться постигнуть и ощутить эту связь между искусствами и воспринимать весь комплекс красоты, что позволяет получить полное впечатление от них. Мне кажется, что автор прав в своих размышлениях, и главная идея текста заключается в том, что любой человек должен стремиться расширять свои интересы в области искусства и получать удовольствие от всего комплекса красоты. В этом контексте важно отметить, что каждый вид искусства имеет свою уникальность, но связь между ними очевидна и эту связь необходимо исследовать и воспринимать в полноте."},{"prompt":"Sáng lập Học viện và là Chủ tịch Hội đồng Khoa học Học viện Sáng lập - Chủ tịch Hiệp hội Khởi nghiệp Quốc gia (VINEN) TS.

Panjang ramp: Semakin panjang ramp, semakin rendah kemiringannya. Oleh karena itu, akan lebih baik jika ramp dibuat sedemikian rupa sehingga panjangnya mencukupi untuk membuat kemiringannya tidak terlalu curam. 2. Ketinggian tempat: Jika tempat yang akan dibuat ramp terletak pada ketinggian yang lebih tinggi daripada permukaan tanah, maka ramp harus dibuat lebih panjang dan lebih landai untuk mencegah kemiringannya terlalu curam. 3. Beban yang akan dibawa: Jika ramp akan digunakan untuk membawa beban yang berat, maka ramp harus dibuat sedemikian rupa sehingga mampu menahan beban tersebut. Hal ini bisa dilakukan dengan menambahkan struktur pendukung (seperti tiang atau bingkai) yang cukup kuat. 4. Material yang digunakan: Jenis material yang digunakan juga dapat mempengaruhi kemiringan ramp. Bahan yang lebih halus dan licin, seperti beton atau ubin keramik, cenderung lebih curam. Sementara itu, bahan yang lebih kasar dan kasar, seperti paving block atau batu kali, cenderung lebih landai. 5. Keamanan: Terakhir, pastikan ramp yang dirancang aman dan dapat digunakan dengan nyaman.

Namun, kemiringan yang tepat tergantung pada beberapa faktor, seperti: 1. Kegunaan ramp: Jika ramp digunakan untuk pejalan kaki atau orang dengan kendaraan roda dua, kemiringan ramp idealnya sekitar 5-6,7 derajat. Namun, jika ramp akan digunakan untuk mengakomodasi kendaraan roda empat atau kursi roda, maka ramp harus lebih landai dengan kemiringan sekitar 2-4,8 derajat. 2. Kondisi fisik pengguna: Kemiringan ramp juga harus mempertimbangkan kondisi fisik pengguna. Jika pengguna memiliki gangguan keseimbangan atau kesulitan berjalan, ramp harus lebih landai dengan kemiringan sekitar 2-4,8 derajat. 3. Panjang ramp: Semakin panjang ramp, semakin rendah kemiringannya harus dibuat. Hal ini dapat meminimalkan kelelahan pengguna saat naik dan turun ramp. 4. Bahan yang digunakan: Bahan yang digunakan untuk membangun ramp juga dapat mempengaruhi kemiringan yang ideal. Material permukaan yang lebih kasar, seperti aspal atau beton kasar, dapat membuat ramp lebih curam, sedangkan material yang halus dan licin seperti ubin keramik atau granit dapat membuat miring lebih landai.

In other words, angle = arctan(y/x) Note that the arctangent function returns the angle in radians, so if you want the angle in degrees, you need to convert it using the formula: angle in degrees = angle in radians * 180/π where π is approximately equal to 3.14159."},{"prompt":"I need to make a turkish language learning material. please write down 15 basic and intermediate turkish words with examples and translation.","completion":"1.

The driver is using his position of power to make unwanted advances towards the passenger, who is trapped in the car with him. The intended meaning of this drawing is to highlight the issue of sexual harassment and abuse of power by those in positions of authority, in this case, a Didi ride-hailing driver. The drawing is calling attention to the fact that some drivers are abusing their power and taking advantage of vulnerable passengers, and this behavior is unacceptable. In my opinion, the drawing is an accurate portrayal of a significant problem within the ride-hailing industry. Didi and other ride-hailing companies need to take strong action to eradicate this behavior and ensure that passengers feel safe while using their services. This can include strict vetting procedures for drivers, better training on appropriate behavior and ethics, and a zero-tolerance policy towards any form of sexual harassment or abuse of power. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of all individuals to treat others with respect and dignity, regardless of their position or status.

The \`signal_generator\` function returns an empty string if there is no clear pattern, but the \`order_execution\` function treats any non-empty string as a valid signal. This may cause unexpected behavior if the signal is not a valid buy/sell signal. 3. The \`order_type\` variable is set to \`'MARKET'\`, which means that orders will be executed at the current market price. It may be better to use a different order type (e.g. limit orders) to have more control over the execution price. 4. The \`leverage\` variable is set to \`125\` but is not used until the \`order_execution\` function. It may be better to pass this variable as an argument to the function to make it clearer where it is being used. 5.
