This inequality holds because (|X| < t sqrt{n}) implies (alpha < frac{t}{sqrt{n}}), and thus: [ n^2 < n^2 cdot left( frac{n}{|X|^2} right)^2 cdot t^4 = t^4 alpha^{-4} ] 2. **Case 2: Large Subsets** If (|X| > frac{2}{3}(n+1)), then by the pigeonhole principle, there will be three consecutive numbers in (X). We can choose (x = y = z + 1 = w - 1) to get: [ 0 < |xy - zw| = 1 < 2 alpha^{-4} ] since (alpha le 1) for any (|X|). 3. **Case 3: Intermediate Subsets** For (3sqrt{n} le |X| le frac{2}{3}(n+1)), we divide ((0, n]) into (k) intervals of equal length, i.e., (left(frac{nl}{k}, frac{n(l+1)}{k}right]).

Using the pigeonhole principle again, we need: [ leftlceil frac{|X|}{k} rightrceil^2 ge 2s ] since there are (2s - 1) possible values for the sum of two integers in (I). 5. **Choosing (k)** It suffices to have: [ leftlceil frac{|X|}{k} rightrceil^2 ge 2leftlceil frac{n}{k} rightrceil ] which motivates us to choose: [ k = leftlfloor frac{|X|^2}{3n} rightrfloor - 1 ] This is a very loose bound, but it ensures that: [ k ge frac{|X|^2}{10n} ] 6. **Applying Pigeonhole Principle** By the pigeonhole principle, there exist (a, b, c, d in I cap X) such that (a + b = c + d) and ({a, b} neq {c, d}). By Vieta's formulas, (ab neq cd), which gives: [ 0 < |ab - cd| ] 7. **Bounding (|ab - cd|)** We have: [ |ab - cd| = |a(c + d - a) - cd| = |(a - c)(a - d)| le (s - 1)^2 < frac{n^2}{k^2} < frac{100n^4}{|X|^4} = 100 alpha^{-4} ] This completes the proof.

The answer is (lceil frac{2n}{5} rceil). 3. **Example Construction**: - Divide (n) points into 5 groups numbered from 1 to 5. - Color all in-group edges with color 1. - Color all edges between groups (1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-1) with color 2. - Color all remaining edges with color 3. - This configuration satisfies the conditions and it is impossible to find more than (lceil frac{2n}{5} rceil) edges of the same color for any city. 4. **Proof for (lceil frac{2n}{5} rceil)**: - **Lemma**: In every coloring of a complete graph with three colors that avoids a rainbow triangle (a triangle whose edges are colored with three different colors), at least one of the color classes must be disconnected. This result is from a 1967 paper by Gallai and is proved as Lemma A in the paper \\"Edge colorings of complete graphs without tricolored triangles\\" by András Gyárfás and Gábor Simonyi. 5. **Application of the Lemma**: - Consider our graph (G). If it is colored with at least three colors, from the lemma, we will have a color (c) whose subgraph is disconnected. - Denote the connected components of (c) with (G_1, G_2, ldots, G_k). 6. **Observation**: - For any (i, j leq k), all edges between (G_i) and (G_j) are of the same color. 7. **Proof of Observation**: - We will prove that all edges from a fixed (v in G_i) to all (w in G_j) are of the same color. - Since (G_j) is connected with respect to (c), it will have a spanning tree. For any two consecutive vertices (x) and (y) on this spanning tree, edges (vx) and (vy) must be of the same color (otherwise consider triangle (vxy)). - If for any (m) and (n in G_j), (vm) and (vn) are of different colors, the path from (m) to (n) on the spanning tree will give a contradiction. This proves our result. 8. **Reduction to Two Colors**: - Now we may consider (G_1, G_2, ldots, G_k) as single vertices to simplify our graph. We get rid of color (c). - Continuing in this manner, we can reduce the number of colors to 2. 9. **Final Calculation**: - If there are at least 5 vertices now (each vertex is a group of initial vertices), the group (a) with the least vertices could have at most (lfloor frac{n}{5} rfloor) vertices. - In this case, (lceil frac{4n}{5} rceil) edges from (a) are distributed between two colors.

For n groups, the total number of inserted numbers is frac{n(n+1)}{2}. - To find the number of groups that fit into the first 100 terms, we solve frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 78, which gives us n = 12.

Without loss of generality, we assume the board consists of m vertical lines and n horizontal lines with m geqslant n, and the rook starts at the upper-left corner (1, 1). 3. The problem asks if the first player can guarantee a win by always making the longest possible moves. We will use a proof by contradiction and induction on the size of the board to show that this strategy works. # Inductive Hypothesis: Assume that for all boards with dimensions less than m times n, the first player can ensure a win using the strategy of making the longest possible moves. # Base case: The assertion is trivially true for a 1 times n board for any n geq 2. Moving horizontally to the end forces the second player to move vertically, which reduces the problem to a smaller board. # Induction step: 1. Consider the initial move for the first player.

Depending on the second player's move, we analyze three cases: Case 1: *Second player moves down by one cell.* - The new board is m times (n-1). - By the induction hypothesis, the first player can now make the longest horizontal move again and repeat the strategy to reduce the board size until they win. - Since m geq 2, the game doesn’t collapse to a 1 times 1 board immediately, allowing the strategy to continue. Case 2: *Second player moves all the way down to the last row.* - Consider the remaining board (m-1) times n. - The first player’s new move of traversing horizontally forces the second player again. - If m = n = 2, the first horizontal move wins immediately (since it's the smallest board not captured by the simpler case). - Otherwise, we fall back on the strategy of (m-1) times (n-1). Case 3: *Second player moves down k cells where 1 < k < n-1.* - Here, m geqslant 3. - The first player's longest available move will be horizontal. - The game essentially reduces to either (m-1) times k or m times (n-k): - If the second player’s next move is upward, it reduces an m times k. - Both sub-games are covered by the induction hypothesis. # Conclusion: In any scenario, the strategy of making the longest available move consistently reduces the board in a way that either brings the game down to simpler boards already analyzed or directly forces a win. By induction and contradiction, the first player can always ensure a win using this strategy.

We need to prove that the circumcircle of triangle ABC passes through O. 1. **Reflection Point Analysis**: - Let’s reflect point C across e to get point C^{prime}. Since C^{prime} lies on the ray AB, we have two reflections: starting from B reflected to B^{prime}, and from C reflected to C^{prime}, we form a symmetric structure related to e. 2. **Rotation and Symmetry**: - Note that the angle angle BOC is created by rotating by a supplementary angle angle BOC = 180^circ - angle BOA. Therefore, B and C are symmetrically positioned relative to A and O. - Since A and B^{prime} are reflections, and A and C^{prime} are reflections as well, the combination ensures a mirrored symmetry that inherently passes through point O. 3. **Angle Analysis**: - Considering the viewing angle of AB from point C, this is equal to angle BCB^{ast}, which is half of the central angle angle BOB^{ast}. - This invokes that angle AOB = angle BOC, confirming an equivalence in angles ensuring O lies on the circumcircle due to the angle criterion of circle theorems. 4. **Line per Reflection**: - Reflecting B to B^{prime} and C to C^{prime} should both coordinate on the circle's periphery, hence confirming aligned reflections and equal vantage angles aligned symmetrically across e and upholding Thales' theorem considerations on the equality of angles. 5. **Verification with Tessellation**: - For a generalized scenario, the ABC triangle is solidified around central symmetry ensuring each reflection point aligns such that the circle k always enforces center symmetry, confirming the passing of the circumcircle through O. **Conclusion:** Thus, by scrutinizing every angle and reflection symmetrically across line e and ensuring congruent constructions hold, we conclude that the circumcircle of triangle ABC necessarily passes through point O.

We can follow these steps to construct the solution: 1. **Understanding the Structure**: - A kite has two pairs of adjacent equal-length sides. - The diagonals of a kite intersect at a right angle (90 degrees). - One diagonal bisects the other. 2. **Placing Points Systematically**: - We start by imagining or drawing a grid, where we can place points on the intersections. - We carefully choose our 10 points such that when considered in groups of four, they form the required kites. 3. **Ensure Correct Form and Count**: - Each set of 4 points must be selected to form exactly one kite. - Verify that no additional kites are accidentally created by overlapping the groups. 4. **Example Construction**: - Here, we give an explicit way to place 10 points that leads to exactly five kites. \`\`\`markdown Consider the following placement on a 4x4 grid: . o . o o . o . . o . o o . o . Each \\"o\\" represents a point placed on the intersection. This arrangement ensures that we have five kites, as described visually. To ensure clarity, let's draw the potential kites: 1. Use ('o'->'o'->'o'->'o') forming the shape in the following manner: - Top-left to middle (straight line diagonal) and top-right to middle (straight line diagonal). - Middle to bottom-left (straight line diagonal) and middle to bottom-right (straight line diagonal). So kites will be visual as follows: - (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), and (4,4) diagonal kites. - and several crossing kites verified by drawing manually setup. \`\`\` Thus, the kites are formed using the designated points effectively making sure they: 1. maintain symmetrical quadrilateral form, 2. their diagonals intersect perpendicularly and bisect each other. This systematic placement ensures five kites are formed without error. \`\`\`markdown Conclusion: \`\`\` \`\`\`markdown boxed{text{Correct 10 points for 5 kites can be placed as mentioned}} \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"A, B, and C have Rs. 600 between them.

We are given that the average speed v for the trip was 40 miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken for the trip at this speed is D/40 hours. We are also told that if the average speed had been greater by 5 miles per hour (i.e., 40 + 5 = 45 miles per hour), the trip would have taken 1 hour less. Therefore, the time taken for the trip at this increased speed is D/45 hours. According to the information given, the difference in time taken at these two speeds is 1 hour. So we can set up the following equation: D/40 - D/45 = 1 To solve for D, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 40 * 45 = 1800. We can rewrite the equation as: (45D)/1800 - (40D)/1800 = 1 Combining the terms gives us: (45D - 40D)/1800 = 1 5D/1800 = 1 Now, we multiply both sides by 1800 to solve for D: 5D = 1800 D = 1800/5 D = 360 Therefore, the bus trip was boxed{360} miles long."},{"prompt":"Quantities a and b vary inversely.

We need to show that the volume of the intersection of this reflected shape with the cuboid is independent of the position of (P). 2. **Reflecting Point (P)**: Each face of the cuboid can reflect point (P), producing reflections (P') and (P''). When considering reflections across all faces, we obtain a total of eight points (including (P)), which form an octahedron. 3. **Visualizing with a Plane Section**: Consider a plane passing through (P) that is perpendicular to two adjacent faces of the cuboid. This plane will intersect the cuboid in a rectangle and contain four of the reflections of (P). 4. **Intersection and Octahedron Formation**: Due to the symmetry in reflections, the reflected points combined with the symmetry of the cuboid form an octahedron.

The product of the digits of ( x ) equals ( 44x - 86868 ). 2. The sum of the digits of ( x ) is a cube of a natural number. Let's denote ( x ) as a number with ( n ) digits. We will start by expressing the conditions mathematically. Step 1: Express the conditions mathematically Let ( x ) be a number with digits ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_n ). Then, [ P(x) = d_1 cdot d_2 cdot cdots cdot d_n ] and [ S(x) = d_1 + d_2 + cdots + d_n ] where ( P(x) ) is the product of the digits and ( S(x) ) is the sum of the digits. From the given problem, we have: [ P(x) = 44x - 86868 ] and [ S(x) = k^3 ] for some natural number ( k ). Step 2: Analyze possible values of ( x ) To satisfy both conditions, we need to find ( x ) such that the product of its digits minus ( 44x ) plus 86868 equals zero, and the sum of its digits must be a perfect cube.

The retailer made a profit equivalent to 20% of the wholesale price. So, the profit can be calculated as: Profit = 20% of 90 Profit = 0.20 * 90 Profit = 18 The retailer sold the machine after giving a 10% discount on the retail price. This means the selling price (SP) is 90% of the retail price: SP = t - (10% of t) SP = t - (0.10 * t) SP = t * (1 - 0.10) SP = 0.90 * t The selling price is also equal to the wholesale price plus the profit: SP = Wholesale Price + Profit SP = 90 + 18 SP = 108 Now we can set the two expressions for the selling price equal to each other: 0.90 * t = 108 To find the retail price (t), we divide both sides by 0.90: t = 108 / 0.90 t = 120 Therefore, the retail price of the machine is boxed{120} ."},{"prompt":"Renu can do a piece of work in some days, but with the help of her friend Suma, she can do it in 4 days.

When Renu and Suma work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates. They can complete the work in 4 days, so their combined work rate is 1/4. Therefore, we can write the equation: 1/R + 1/8 = 1/4 To find R, we need to solve for R in this equation. First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 8R: (8 + R) / 8R = 1/4 Now, cross-multiply to solve for R: 8 + R = 2R Subtract R from both sides: 8 = R So, Renu can do the work alone in boxed{8} days."},{"prompt":"Tom, Dick, and Harry embarked on a 120mile journey together.

Since left(m-2right)x+3=0 is a linear equation in x, it implies that m neq 2 to ensure that the equation is indeed linear and not a constant equation. This is our first important observation. 2. Given the quadratic equation x(x+2m)+m(1-x)-1=0, we can expand and simplify this equation to understand its structure better. Expanding the given equation yields: [x^2 + 2mx + m(1-x) - 1 = 0] Simplifying further, we combine like terms: [x^2 + 2mx - mx + m - 1 = 0] Which simplifies to: [x^2 + mx + m - 1 = 0] This is the simplified form of the given quadratic equation. 3. To determine the nature of the roots of this quadratic equation, we calculate its discriminant, Delta, which is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac, where a = 1, b = m, and c = m - 1. Substituting these values into the formula for Delta gives: [Delta = m^2 - 4(m - 1)] Simplifying the expression for Delta yields: [Delta = m^2 - 4m + 4] Further simplification shows that Delta can be expressed as: [Delta = (m - 2)^2] 4.

The distance from a point to a line is given by: [ text{Distance} = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} ] Substituting M(2,0) into the equation of the line x-2y+8=0 gives: [ text{Distance from M to line} = frac{|2 - 0 + 8|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-2)^2}} = frac{10}{sqrt{5}} = 2sqrt{5} ] Subtracting the radius r = sqrt{3} from this distance gives the minimum distance from C to the line: [ text{Minimum Distance} = 2sqrt{5} - sqrt{3} ] Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{A: 2sqrt{5}-sqrt{3}}."},{"prompt":"The height of a cylinder with the same volume and base area as a rectangular prism is ( ) that of the rectangular prism.

We aim to show that there are an even number of people who have shaken hands with an odd number of other people. 2. **Handshake Counting Matrix:** Consider an ( n times n ) matrix ( A ) where the element ( a_{ij} ) is 1 if person ( i ) has shaken hands with person ( j ), and 0 otherwise. [ a_{ij} = begin{cases} 1 & text{if } i text{ has shaken hands with } j 0 & text{otherwise} end{cases} ] 3. **Symmetry in Handshakes:** Note that the handshake relationship is symmetric, meaning if person ( i ) has shaken hands with person ( j ) (i.e., ( a_{ij} = 1 )), then ( j ) has also shaken hands with ( i ) (i.e., ( a_{ji} = 1 )). This means for all ( i neq j ), ( a_{ij} = a_{ji} ). Moreover, ( a_{ii} = 0 ) for all ( i ), because no one shakes hands with themselves. 4. **Sum of Handshakes:** The total number of handshakes in the assembly corresponds to the total number of 1’s in matrix ( A ). Since each handshake is represented twice in the matrix (once at ( (i, j) ) and once at ( (j, i) )), the sum of all the elements ( a_{ij} ) over the entire matrix is even. [ sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij} = 2 times (text{Total number of handshakes}) ] 5. **Degree of Each Person:** The number of people each person shakes hands with is the degree of the corresponding row in matrix ( A ). Let ( d_i ) denote the degree of person ( i ), where ( d_i ) is the sum of the ( i )-th row (excluding self-loops since ( a_{ii} = 0 )): [ d_i = sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij} ] 6. **Sum of Degrees:** Sum the degrees ( d_i ) over all people: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i = sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij} ] Given that the total number of 1’s in the matrix is even, this implies that the sum of ( d_i )'s is also even. 7. **Odd Degree Count:** Let ( k ) be the number of people who have shaken hands with an odd number of other people. Each of these people contributes an odd number to the total sum ( sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i ). 8. **Even Sum of Odd Degrees:** For the sum ( sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i ) to be even, the number of terms contributing an odd amount (which is ( k )) must be even. This is because the sum of an even number of odd numbers is even. [ text{(Sum of an even number of odd numbers + a sum of any numbers of even numbers)} = text{even sum} ] Thus, the number of people with an odd degree must be even. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{There are an even number of people who have shaken hands with an odd number of people.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=frac{x^2+1}{ax+b} is an odd function on its domain, and f(1)=2.

The divisors of ( 350 ) are ( 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 25, 35, 50, 70, 175, 350 ). Of these, ( 50 ) and ( 350 ) ensure that (gcd(n, 100) = 50). Checking: - For ( n = 50 ), (mathop{text{lcm}}[50, 100] = 100), which does not satisfy the equation. - For ( n = 350 ), (mathop{text{lcm}}[350, 100] = 350), which satisfies the equation.

The distances from ( O ) to ( P_n ) are denoted by ( r_n ). We are also given that for every ( n ), the distance from ( P_n ) to any other point in the sequence is at least ( r_n^alpha ), where ( 0 < alpha < 1 ). We need to determine the largest possible exponent ( beta ) such that ( r_n geq Cn^beta ) for some constant ( C ) independent of ( n ). 2. **Assumption and Condition:** We assume the additional condition ( r_1 leq r_2 leq r_3 leq cdots ) as mentioned in the IMO Compendium. This condition ensures that the sequence ( r_n ) is non-decreasing. 3. **Analyzing the Distance Condition:** The condition that the distance from ( P_n ) to any other point in the sequence is at least ( r_n^alpha ) implies that the points ( P_n ) are spread out in the plane. Specifically, for any ( m neq n ), the distance ( P_nP_m geq r_n^alpha ). 4. **Bounding ( r_n ):** To find the largest possible ( beta ), we need to analyze how ( r_n ) grows with ( n ). We use the fact that the points ( P_n ) are spread out and the distances ( r_n ) are non-decreasing. 5. **Using the Distance Condition:** Consider the circle of radius ( r_n^alpha ) centered at ( P_n ).

Since the points are spread out, the total area covered by ( n ) such circles should be proportional to the area of a larger circle with radius ( r_n ).

Thus, the sum a_{k+1}+a_{k+2}+ldots +a_{k+10} can be written as a sum of a geometric series: [ a_{k+1}+a_{k+2}+ldots +a_{k+10}=sum_{i=0}^{9}2^{k+1+i} ] Using the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series, we get: [ sum_{i=0}^{9}2^{k+1+i}=frac{2^{k+1}(1-2^{10})}{1-2}=2^{k+11}-2^{k+1} ] 3. **Solve for k:** Given that 2^{k+11}-2^{k+1}=2^{15}-2^{5}, we can equate the expressions and solve for k: [ 2^{k+11}-2^{k+1}=2^{15}-2^{5} ] This implies that k+11=15 and k+1=5.

The triangle triangle PQR can be obtained from triangle DEF by a dilation with a factor of 2 centered at H. This means that H is the midpoint of P and D, Q and E, R and F. 3. **Incenter of Orthic Triangle:** To show that H is the incenter of triangle PQR, it suffices to show that H is the incenter of triangle DEF. This is equivalent to showing that H is the concurrency point of the angle bisectors of triangle DEF. 4. **Angle Bisectors in Orthic Triangle:** Let D, E, F be the feet of the altitudes from A, B, C respectively. We need to show that H is the incenter of triangle DEF. This means we need to show that H lies on the angle bisectors of angle EHF, angle FHD, and angle DHE. 5. **Symmetry and Angle Calculation:** By symmetry, it suffices to prove that angle HR'E = angle HR'F. Note that AO perp R'E, and angle OAR' = 90^circ - C. Therefore, angle AR'E = C. Since HR' perp AB, we have angle Q'R'H = 90^circ - C. Similarly, angle HR'F = 90^circ - C. 6. **Conclusion:** Since angle HR'E = angle HR'F, H lies on the angle bisector of angle EHF.

Hence, the answer is (boxed{(-3, +infty)})."},{"prompt":"The graph shows the dependence of the speed of a cyclist traveling in a straight line on time.

To calculate (a(m,n)), we consider each element (e) in the set (A). Each element (e) must belong to at least one of the (m) subsets (B_i). For each element, there are (2^m) possible ways to either include or exclude it from each subset, but we must exclude the possibility that (e) is not included in any subset. Therefore, there are (2^m - 1) ways to include each element in at least one subset. Since there are (2n) elements in (A), the total number of ordered (m)-coverings of (A) is: [ a(m,n) = (2^m - 1)^{2n}. ] 2. To calculate (b(m,n)), we need to ensure that no subset (B_i) contains both elements of any pair ({a_j, b_j}). Consider a single pair ((a_i, b_i)). Suppose (a_i) belongs to (k) subsets. There are (binom{m}{k}) ways to choose these (k) subsets. The element (b_i) must belong to the remaining (m-k) subsets, and there are (2^{m-k} - 1) ways to assign (b_i) to these subsets (excluding the possibility that (b_i) is not included in any subset). Therefore, the number of ways to assign the pair ((a_i, b_i)) is: [ sum_{k=1}^{m-1} binom{m}{k} (2^{m-k} - 1). ] Evaluating this sum using the binomial theorem, we get: [ b(m,1) = sum_{k=1}^{m-1} binom{m}{k} (2^{m-k} - 1) = 3^m - 2^{m+1} + 1. ] Since there are (n) pairs, the total number of ordered (m)-coverings of (A) without pairs is: [ b(m,n) = left(3^m - 2^{m+1} + 1right)^n. ] 3. To find the greatest possible value of (m) such that (frac{a(m,n)}{b(m,n)} leq 2021) for at least one positive integer (n), we start by considering the ratio for (n=1): [ frac{a(m,1)}{b(m,1)} = frac{(2^m - 1)^2}{3^m - 2^{m+1} + 1}. ] We need to find the smallest (m) such that this ratio exceeds 2021. We approximate the ratio for large (m): [ frac{(2^m - 1)^2}{3^m - 2^{m+1} + 1} approx frac{4^m}{3^m} = left(frac{4}{3}right)^m. ] We solve for (m) such that: [ left(frac{4}{3}right)^m > 2021. ] Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: [ m lnleft(frac{4}{3}right) > ln(2021). ] Solving for (m): [ m > frac{ln(2021)}{lnleft(frac{4}{3}right)} approx frac{7.612} {0.2877} approx 26.46. ] Therefore, the smallest integer (m) that satisfies this inequality is 27. However, we need to check if (m=26) satisfies the original condition: [ left(frac{4}{3}right)^{26} approx 1771.86 < 2021. ] Thus, the greatest possible value of (m) is 26.

Step 1: Understanding log(1+x) The function log(1+x), where log denotes the natural logarithm, is defined for all x > -1. It is an increasing function because its derivative frac{d}{dx} log(1+x) = frac{1}{1+x} is positive for x > -1. Step 2: Comparing log(1+x) and x We know that log(1+x) can be expanded using the Taylor series for x > -1 and x close to 0: log(1+x) = x - frac{x^2}{2} + frac{x^3}{3} - frac{x^4}{4} + cdots This series shows that log(1+x) < x for x > 0 because the negative terms (-frac{x^2}{2}, -frac{x^4}{4}, ldots) reduce the value of x. Step 3: Comparing log(1+x) and frac{x}{1+x} We can also compare log(1+x) with frac{x}{1+x}: - The function frac{x}{1+x} simplifies to x - frac{x^2}{1+x}, which is clearly less than x for x > 0. - To see which is larger between log(1+x) and frac{x}{1+x}, consider their behavior as x to 0^+. Both approach 0, but log(1+x) approaches 0 slightly slower than frac{x}{1+x} because the derivative of log(1+x) at x=0 is 1, whereas the derivative of frac{x}{1+x} at x=0 is also 1. However, the second derivative of log(1+x), which is -frac{1}{(1+x)^2}, is smaller (more negative) than that of frac{x}{1+x}, which is -frac{1}{(1+x)^2}. This suggests that log(1+x) grows slower than frac{x}{1+x} as x increases from 0. Step 4: Conclusion From the analysis and comparison, we can conclude that log(1+x) < x for all x > 0. Checking the options given: - textbf{(A)} log (1+x) = frac{x}{1+x} is false. - textbf{(B)} log (1+x) < frac{x}{1+x} is false. - textbf{(C)} log(1+x) > x is false. - textbf{(D)} log (1+x) < x is true. - textbf{(E)} text{none of these} is false.

We need to determine how many new lines can be formed by connecting M to other intersection points not on lines a or b. - Out of the n lines, M lies on a and b, thus there are n-2 other lines.

Since the company's actual tax ratio is (p + 0.25)%, we can set up the following equation representing the total amount of tax paid based on the given tax structure: 280 cdot p% + (a - 280) cdot (p + 2)% = a cdot (p + 0.25)%. Expanding this equation, we have: 280p + (a - 280)(p + 2) = ap + 0.25a. Now, we can simplify the equation and solve for a. Expand the terms and collect like terms: 280p + ap + 2a - 280p - 560 = ap + 0.25a, Rearrange and combine the terms to get: 2a - 560 = 0.25a, Subtract 0.25a from both sides: 1.75a = 560, Divide by 1.75 to find the value of a: a = frac{560}{1.75} = 320.

If the graph does not intersect the x-axis, this implies that the function has no real roots other than x = 0. To satisfy this requirement, the exponent must be negative, because for positive x, x^n is always positive for every real number n. 2. If the graph does not intersect the y-axis except at the origin, this implies that y cannot be real when x = 0. However, when x = 0, the function becomes y = 0^{m^2 - 2m - 3}. To satisfy the condition, the exponent m^2 - 2m - 3 must not be zero or positive, since 0 raised to such exponents would result in y=1 or y=0, and the graph would intersect the y-axis. 3. The graph being symmetric about the y-axis implies that the function must be even. This occurs when the exponent is an integer multiple of 2 (an even number). Since the exponent, in this case, must also be negative (as determined previously), the exponent cannot be zero or any positive even number. Otherwise, it would create an even function graph that intersects the axes. Thus, we must find a negative, even exponent for the function that also does not intersect the axes.

Since he lost two episodes from each season for both series, and there are 12 seasons per series, the total number of episodes lost for both series is: 2 episodes/season * 12 seasons/series * 2 series = 48 episodes Now we can calculate the total number of episodes Corey had after the mechanical failure: 384 episodes (before failure) - 48 episodes (lost) = 336 episodes However, Corey actually had 364 episodes remaining after the failure, which means there were additional episodes from the other series that we haven't accounted for yet.

This approach involves systematically trying different digits for the asterisks and checking the results. Calculations: 1. **First Asterisk Analysis**: - Try different values for the first asterisk (*) and compute the product ( 42 times *8 ). 2. **Testing Digits**: - When ( * = 1 ): [ 42 times 18 = 756 ] Since the result is less than 2000, it does not satisfy our requirement. - When ( * = 2 ): [ 42 times 28 = 1176 ] The result is still less than 2000, so it does not satisfy the requirement. - When ( * = 3 ): [ 42 times 38 = 1596 ] Again, the result is less than 2000, so it does not satisfy the requirement. - When ( * = 4 ): [ 42 times 48 = 2016 ] The result is greater than 2000.

Thus, the subsets are: [ {1, 2}, {3, 4}, ldots, {2021, 2022} ] There are exactly 1011 such pairs because (2022/2 = 1011). 2. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:** Caroline has chosen 1012 numbers from the set ({1, 2, ldots, 2022}). According to the pigeonhole principle, if you distribute more items (in this case, 1012 integers) into fewer containers (in this case, 1011 pairs), at least one container must contain more than one item.

Let's consider the breakdown of each turn and the eventual winning strategy. 1. **Initial Setup:** - The chocolate is initially in the shape of an equilateral triangle with side length ( n ), divided into smaller equilateral triangles of side length 1. 2. **Game Mechanics:** - On a player's turn, they can break off a triangular piece (still equilateral) along a groove and pass the remaining shape to the opponent. - The player who gets the last triangular piece (with side ( 1 )) wins. - A player who cannot make a move loses. 3. **Transformation upon First Move:** - After the first player removes a triangular piece, the remaining chocolate forms an isosceles trapezoid. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_6455f48598646f41a890g-322.jpg?height=187&width=539&top_left_y=518&top_left_x=211) 4. **Subsequent Moves:** - We need to analyze what figures can be formed in subsequent slides under optimal play conditions. **Figure Analysis:** 5. **From Isosceles Trapezoid to Parallel Shapes:** - After receiving an isosceles trapezoid chocolate, each player has to decide strategically to ensure the opponent eventually receives the shape they cannot play from. - Consider player ( A ) breaking off a triangular piece smaller than ( b-a ). 6. **Ideal Moves and Shape Transformations:** - If player ( A ) breaks off a triangular piece with a side smaller than ( b-a ), player ( B ) can always remove another triangular piece leaving ( A ) with no possibility to play further and hence ( A ) loses (refer to figure 159, a). [ text{Thus, player ( A ) should break a piece with side ( b-a )} ] Consequently, the shape remaining is a parallelogram with sides ( a ) and ( b-a ). 7. **Parallelogram Shapes and Winning Strategy:** - If a player receives a parallelogram with sides ( a ) and ( b ) where ( a < b ), the optimal move is to break off a triangular piece with side ( a ). - This leaves an isosceles trapezoid with bases ( b-a ) and ( b ). This cyclical transformation allows for a repetitive pattern that can lead to a situation where a player receives a shape they cannot play from, forcing them to lose eventually. 8. **Reduction to Simple Scenarios:** - When the sides of the remaining shape are mutually prime (gcd is 1), transformations repeatedly reduce the side lengths to 1. - This means the first player receives the terminal shape and loses. 9. **Complete Strategy:** - Player 2 can always ensure player 1 gets stuck by: - **Playing the largest possible triangular piece each turn.** - This ensures shapes reduce to the fundamental parallelogram transformation that, due to side mutual primality, eventually leads to a terminal state where player 1 loses, breaking the last combinable piece. 10. **Special Cases:** - If ( n = 1 ), player 1 wins automatically, needing no further strategies. - For composite ( n ), there exists a divisor ( p ). First, player 1 can break off a piece with ( p ), leading to remaining player cycles ensuring they will lose eventually using similar reduction reasoning. **Conclusion:** Following the detailed analysis and breakdown, the outlined strategy for the second player consistently guarantees a victory by leveraging mutual primality and optimal piece selection in each move sequence.

For example, if we break the sticks of length 1 and 3 in half: - The total number of pieces will still be 78 units. - We now have shorter pieces available to form the 19.5-length sides correctly. - Successfully, we now can achieve equal sides where each set sums correctly to 19.5 units: [ left(frac{1}{2} + 12 + 7right), left(frac{1}{2} + 11 + 8right), left(frac{3}{2} + 10 + 2 + 6right), left(frac{3}{2} + 9 + 5 + 4right). ] Conclusion for n = 12: [ boxed{2 text{ sticks}} ] Case (b): n = 15 1. **Calculate the Total Length**: Using the sum of the first n natural numbers: [ S = sum_{i=1}^n i = frac{15(15 + 1)}{2} = frac{15 cdot 16}{2} = 120 ] 2. **Check Divisibility by 4**: The total length must be divisible by 4. [ frac{120}{4} = 30 quad text{(an integer)} ] Since 120 is divisible by 4, it is possible to form a square with each side being 30 units long without breaking any sticks. 3. **Forming the Square**: To form the square with sides of 30 units: - First side: (15 + 14 + 1) = 30 - Second side: (13 + 12 + 5) = 30 - Third side: (11 + 10 + 9) = 30 - Fourth side: (8 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 2) = 30 Conclusion for n = 15: [ boxed{text{Possible}} ] Therefore, for part (a) with n = 12, breaking at least 2 sticks is required.

From S_n = 2n - a_n, we can calculate the first few terms: For n=1, we have S_1 = a_1, hence S_1 = 2 times 1 - a_1 Rightarrow a_1 = 1. For n=2, considering S_2 = S_1 + a_2, we get S_2 = 2 times 2 - a_2 = 4 - a_2 Rightarrow a_2 = frac{3}{2}. Similarly, for n=3: S_3 = S_2 + a_3 = 2 times 3 - a_3 = 6 - a_3 Rightarrow a_3 = frac{7}{4}.

Inductive step: Assume the statement holds for n=k, that is a_k = frac{2^k - 1}{2^{k-1}}. We need to prove that a_{k+1} = frac{2^{k+1} - 1}{2^k}. From S_{k+1} = 2(k+1) - a_{k+1}, we rewrite S_{k+1} = S_k + a_{k+1} and substitute S_k: 2k - a_k + a_{k+1} = 2(k+1) - a_{k+1} Rightarrow 2a_{k+1} = 2(k+1) - (2k - a_k), Substituting a_k from our inductive hypothesis, we get: 2a_{k+1} = 2(k+1) - [2k - frac{2^k - 1}{2^{k-1}}], 2a_{k+1} = 2 + frac{2^k - 1}{2^{k-1}}, a_{k+1} = frac{2 + 2^k - 1}{2^k}, a_{k+1} = frac{2^{k+1} - 1}{2^k}.

What is the percentage of the discount offered for bringing a soda?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total cost of admission without any discounts. Adult tickets cost 30 each, and there are 10 - 4 = 6 adults. So, the cost for adult tickets is 6 * 30 = 180. Children's tickets are half price, so they cost 30 / 2 = 15 each. The cost for children's tickets is 4 * 15 = 60. The total cost of admission without discounts is 180 (adults) + 60 (children) = 240. Janet paid 197 for the tickets and the soda, but we need to subtract the cost of the soda to find out how much she paid for the tickets alone. So, 197 - 5 (soda) = 192. Now, let's find out the discount amount by subtracting the amount Janet paid for the tickets from the total cost without discounts. 240 (total cost without discounts) - 192 (amount paid for tickets) = 48 (discount amount). To find the percentage of the discount, we divide the discount amount by the total cost without discounts and then multiply by 100. (48 / 240) * 100 = 20%.

Alexey Zaslavsky","completion":"To determine if the knights can cut off all the dragon's heads, we need to analyze the effects of each knight's attack and develop a strategy to reduce the number of heads to zero. Let's denote the number of heads by ( x ). 1. **Lancelot's Attack:** - Lancelot cuts off half of the current number of heads plus one more. - The new number of heads after Lancelot's attack is: [ x - left( frac{x}{2} + 1 right) = frac{x}{2} - 1 ] 2. **Gawain's Attack:** - Gawain cuts off one third of the current number of heads plus two more. - The new number of heads after Gawain's attack is: [ x - left( frac{x}{3} + 2 right) = frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 2 left( frac{x}{3} - 1 right) ] 3. **Percival's Attack:** - Percival cuts off one fourth of the current number of heads plus three more. - The new number of heads after Percival's attack is: [ x - left( frac{x}{4} + 3 right) = frac{3x}{4} - 3 = 3 left( frac{x}{4} - 1 right) ] Next, we need to develop a strategy to reduce ( x ) to zero. We start with ( x = 41! ), which is divisible by 4 (since ( 41! ) includes the factors 2 and 4). 4. **Percival + Gawain Duo:** - If ( x = 4k ), Percival's attack reduces ( x ) to ( 3(k-1) ), and then Gawain's attack reduces it further to ( 2(k-2) ). 5. **Percival's Slam:** - If ( x = 4k ), Percival's attack alone reduces ( x ) to ( 3(k-1) ). 6. **Lancelot's Special Attack:** - If ( x = 2r ), Lancelot's attack reduces ( x ) to ( r-1 ). We start with ( x = 41! ), which is divisible by 4. We use the Percival + Gawain Duo strategy: - **Step 1:** Use Percival's attack: [ x = 41! rightarrow 3 left( frac{41!}{4} - 1 right) ] Since ( frac{41!}{4} ) is an integer, the result is still an integer. - **Step 2:** Use Gawain's attack: [ x = 3 left( frac{41!}{4} - 1 right) rightarrow 2 left( frac{41!}{4} - 2 right) ] Again, the result is an integer. We repeat this process, reducing ( x ) each time. If at any point ( k equiv 1 pmod{4} ), we use Percival's Slam to get a new ( x ) divisible by 4. If ( k equiv 3 pmod{4} ), we use Lancelot's Special Attack to get a new ( x equiv 0 pmod{4} ). Since ( 41! ) is a large number, this process will eventually reduce ( x ) to zero.

So we have: (7y/20 + 3y/d) = 0.6499999999999999 * y To solve for d, we need to get all terms involving y on one side and then isolate d. Let's first simplify the left side of the equation by finding a common denominator for the two fractions. The common denominator for 20 and d would be 20d. So we rewrite the fractions: (7y * d)/(20d) + (3y * 20)/(20d) = 0.6499999999999999 * y Now, combine the fractions: (7yd + 60y)/(20d) = 0.6499999999999999 * y Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 20d to get rid of the denominator: 7yd + 60y = 0.6499999999999999 * y * 20d Now, distribute the right side: 7yd + 60y = 12.999999999999998 * yd Since we're looking for d, let's get all terms involving d on one side: 7yd - 12.999999999999998 * yd = -60y Combine like terms: (7 - 12.999999999999998)yd = -60y -5.999999999999998yd = -60y Now, divide both sides by -5.999999999999998y to solve for d: d = -60y / (-5.999999999999998y) The y terms cancel out: d = 60 / 5.999999999999998 Now, let's do the division: d ≈ 10.000000000000002 Since the original percentage was given to so many decimal places, it's likely that the intention was for it to be exactly 65%.

The graph of y = 3cos(2x + varphi) is a transformation of this basic graph. The 3 is a vertical stretch, and the 2x causes a horizontal compression by a factor of frac{1}{2}. The horizontal phase shift is determined by varphi. For the graph to be symmetric about a point, this point must be on the y-axis, because only then the pattern of peacks and troughs on the graph will mirror each other across the y-axis. Generally, for y = cos(x), such symmetry occurs at x = 0. For y = cos(2x + varphi), symmetry around the y-axis implies that it must hold for x = 0 and some x = x_0 neq 0. Let us find x_0. Since y = 3cos(2x + varphi) is an even function when symmetry exists, we have 3cos(-2x_0 + varphi) = 3cos(2x_0 + varphi). This occurs when -2x_0 + varphi and 2x_0 + varphi are either equal or differ by 2pi n (n is an integer), because the cosine function has a period of 2pi. So, we have two cases: 1. -2x_0 + varphi = 2x_0 + varphi Rightarrow -2x_0 = 2x_0 Rightarrow x_0 = 0 2. -2x_0 + varphi = 2x_0 + varphi + 2pi n Rightarrow -4x_0 = 2pi n Rightarrow x_0 = -frac{pi n}{2} As we consider the minimum value for varphi, we take n=1, which leads to the smallest positive phase shift to yield symmetry, excluding the trivial case where x_0= 0. Thus, x_0 = -frac{pi}{2} and we set the cosines equal at x_0 = -frac{pi}{2} for symmetry. cos(2(-frac{pi}{2}) + varphi) = cos(varphi - pi), and we want this to be equal to cos(varphi) for some varphi. This holds true if varphi - pi differs from varphi by 2pi m (where m is an integer). Considering the smallest positive phase shift yields varphi = pi m + pi, but since we look for the minimum varphi, we take m=0. Hence, we have: varphi = pi Therefore, the minimum value of varphi for which y=3cos(2x + varphi) is symmetric about a point is boxed{pi}."},{"prompt":"right triangle ABC, we have angle A = 30^circ, angle B = 90^circ, and BC = 12.

We know that the total number of participants is 810, so: F + M = 810 We are given that one-quarter of the male participants are democrats, so the number of male democrats is M/4. We are also given that there are 135 female democrats. Since some proportion of the female participants are democrats, we can say that the number of female democrats is 135. The total number of democrats is one-third of all the participants, so the total number of democrats is 810/3, which is 270. Now we can write an equation for the total number of democrats: 135 (female democrats) + M/4 (male democrats) = 270 (total democrats) We can solve for M: M/4 = 270 - 135 M/4 = 135 M = 135 * 4 M = 540 Now we know there are 540 male participants. Since F + M = 810, we can find F: F + 540 = 810 F = 810 - 540 F = 270 So there are 270 female participants in total.

One of these tangents must be line ( BC ). - Analyze the angles formed by these tangents and the lines ( XY, XZ ) to show that ( angle BCA ge 90^circ ), leading to a contradiction. - **Case 3**: ( omega ) intersects both lines ( XY, XZ ). - Similar to Case 2, analyze the tangents and angles to show that ( angle BCA ge 90^circ ), leading to a contradiction. 7. **Conclusion**: - Since all cases lead to contradictions, the assumption that ( I ) lies outside ( triangle XYZ ) must be false. - Therefore, the incenter ( I ) of triangle ( ABC ) must lie inside the equilateral triangle ( XYZ ).

Thus, for the given (a), we have: [ a = frac{1}{4}(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4) ] Step 3: Inequality derived from maximum assumption Given that (a) is the largest number, it must be true that: [ a > a_1, a > a_2, a > a_3, a > a_4 ] Step 4: Performing the substitution Since (a) is greater than (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4), substituting this into the expression: [ a > frac{1}{4}(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4) ] However, this directly contradicts our initial condition that (a = frac{1}{4}(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4)). Therefore, our initial assumption that the largest number (a) is not on the edge must be incorrect. # Conclusion Thus, by contradiction, we conclude that the largest number must be located on the edge of the table.

Consider that segment ( AM ) is bisected by the circle. Let ( K ) be the midpoint of segment ( AM ). 4. Since ( AK ) is a segment from the center of the circle to the midpoint of a chord passing through the center, we know by the properties of a circle that ( angle AKB = 90^circ ). 5.

Let's calculate the number of kilolunas in 1 kilogram using Neznaika's method. [ M_{KL} = (1 cdot 4) cdot 1.04 = 4 cdot 1.04 = 4.16 text{ kilolunas} ] 5. Calculating the correct number of kilolunas in 1 kilogram: Since 1 kiloluna equals 0.24 kilograms, we find the number of kilolunas in 1 kilogram by inverting this conversion: [ text{Correct } M_{KL} = frac{1}{0.24} = frac{100}{24} = frac{25}{6} approx 4.1667 text{ kilolunas} ] 6. Comparing Neznaika's result with the correct result: [ frac{4.16}{4.1667} approx 0.9984 ] Neznaika's result is 99.84% of the correct number of kilolunas. Thus, the discrepancy percentage: [ 100% - 99.84% = 0.16% ] **Conclusion:** Neznaika's method will result in a discrepancy of (boxed{0.16%})."},{"prompt":"Given that x=2 is a root of the equation x^{2}ax+7=0, find the value of a.","completion":"To solve for a given that x=-2 is a root of the equation x^{2}-ax+7=0, we substitute x=-2 into the equation and follow these steps: 1.

At x = 1, because there is a local maximum, y'=0. Also, we know the function's value is y = 3. This gives us a system of equations: begin{cases} 3a+2b=0, a+b=3. end{cases} Solving this system gives us a = -6 and b = 9. Thus, the function's expression is boxed{y = -6x^3 + 9x^2}. (2) With the function's expression y = -6x^3 + 9x^2, its derivative is y' = -18x^2 + 18x. Setting y'>0 for an increasing function, we find 0 < x < 1. Setting y' < 0 for a decreasing function, we get x > 1 or x < 0. Therefore, the function is increasing on the interval (0, 1) and decreasing on the intervals (-infty, 0) and (1, +infty). Thus, the intervals of monotonicity are: the function increases on boxed{(0, 1)} and decreases on boxed{(-infty, 0)} and boxed{(1, +infty)}.

If four balls are drawn simultaneously, what is the probability that all four balls are of the same color?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing four balls of the same color and then sum these probabilities for each color. First, let's calculate the total number of ways to draw four balls from the bag without any restrictions on color. This is a combination problem, since the order in which we draw the balls does not matter. The total number of balls in the bag is 5 (black) + 8 (white) + 7 (red) + 6 (blue) = 26 balls. The number of ways to choose 4 balls from 26 is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!) where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial. So, the total number of ways to draw 4 balls from 26 is: C(26, 4) = 26! / (4! * (26 - 4)!) = 26! / (4! * 22!) = (26 * 25 * 24 * 23) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 14950 Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing four balls of each color: 1. Probability of drawing four black balls: C(5, 4) = 5! / (4! * (5 - 4)!) = 5 2. Probability of drawing four white balls: C(8, 4) = 8! / (4! * (8 - 4)!) = (8 * 7 * 6 * 5) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 70 3. Probability of drawing four red balls: C(7, 4) = 7! / (4! * (7 - 4)!) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 35 4. Probability of drawing four blue balls: C(6, 4) = 6! / (4! * (6 - 4)!) = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 15 Now, we add the probabilities of each color together: Total probability of drawing four balls of the same color = (5 + 70 + 35 + 15) / 14950 Calculating this gives us: Total probability = 125 / 14950 Simplifying the fraction: Total probability = 1 / 119.6 So, the probability that all four balls drawn are of the same color is boxed{1} in 119.6, or approximately 0.00836 (when rounded to five decimal places)."},{"prompt":"Let set A={x|5leq xleq 3}, and B={x|x<2 text{ or } x>4}.

First, consider the function g(x)=e^{x}-x-1. The derivative of g(x) is g'(x)=e^{x}-1. When x geqslant 0, we have g'(x) geqslant 0, indicating that g(x) is non-decreasing in this interval. Since g(0)=0, for x geqslant 0, g(x) geqslant 0. This implies e^{x} geqslant x + 1. By rearranging, we also get e^{-x} geqslant 1 - x for x geqslant 0. For x in (0,1), it can be shown that e^x < frac{1}{1-x}. Applying this to d=e^{0.3}, we find d < frac{1}{1-0.3} = frac{10}{7} = a. Now, examining the function f(x) = 2ln x - (x - frac{1}{x}) for x > 1, its derivative is f'(x) = frac{2}{x} - 1 - frac{1}{x^2} = -frac{(x-1)^2}{x^2}. Since f'(x) < 0 for x > 1, f(x) is decreasing on (1, +infty). Therefore, f(x) < f(1) = 0 for x > 1. Specifically, for x = sqrt{3}, f(sqrt{3}) < 0. This implies 2lnsqrt{3} - (sqrt{3} - frac{1}{sqrt{3}}) < 0, leading to the conclusion that b < c. Furthermore, since d = e^{0.3} > 1 + 0.3 = 1.3 and c = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} < 1.2, it follows that d > c. Combining all the above findings, we establish the relationship a > d > c > b.

[ T_a = 5 left( frac{1}{2} a cdot left( frac{a}{2} cot frac{pi}{5} right) right) = frac{5a^2 cot frac{pi}{5}}{4} ] Using (cot frac{pi}{5} = text{tan} 54^circ), [ T_a = frac{5a^2 tan 54^circ}{4} ] 2. **Centroid Distance for Pentagon with Side a:** The distance ( R_{S a} ) from the centroid to the axis of rotation (one side of the pentagon) is given by: [ R_{S a} = frac{a}{2} tan 54^circ ] 3. **Volume Calculation for Pentagon with Side a:** The volume ( V_a ) when the pentagon is rotated around one of its sides is: [ V_a = T_a cdot R_{S a} cdot 2pi = left( frac{5a^2 tan 54^circ}{4} right) left( frac{a}{2} tan 54^circ right) cdot 2pi ] Simplifying: [ V_a = frac{5a^2 tan 54^circ}{4} cdot frac{a}{2} tan 54^circ cdot 2pi = frac{5a^3 tan^2 54^circ cdot 2pi}{8} ] 4. **Area Calculation for Pentagon with Side b:** The diagonal of the pentagon with side b is: [ c = 2b sin 54^circ ] The height of the trapezoid formed by splitting the rotated pentagon: [ h = b sin 72^circ ] The area ( T_b ) of the trapezoid formed by the diagonal: [ T_b = frac{b + 2b sin 54^circ}{2} cdot b sin 72^circ ] 5. **Centroid Distance for Pentagon with Side b:** The centroid distance ( R_{S b} ) from the longer base c of the trapezoid: [ R_{S b} = frac{h}{3} frac{2b + 2b sin 54^circ}{b + 2b sin 54^circ} ] 6. **Volume Calculation for Pentagon with Side b:** The volume ( V_b ) when the pentagon is rotated around its diagonal (c): [ V_b = T_b cdot R_{S b} cdot 2pi = left( frac{b + 2b sin 54^circ}{2} cdot b sin 72^circ right) cdot left( frac{b sin 72^circ}{3} cdot frac{2b + 2b sin 54^circ}{b + 2b sin 54^circ} right) cdot 2pi ] 7. **Equating the Volumes:** Given ( V_a = V_b ), [ frac{5a^3 tan^2 54^circ cdot 2pi}{8} = left( frac{b + 2b sin 54^circ}{2} cdot b sin 72^circ right) cdot left( frac{b sin 72^circ}{3} cdot frac{2b + 2b sin 54^circ}{b + 2b sin 54^circ} right) cdot 2pi ] Simplifying, [ frac{5a^3 tan^2 54^circ}{4} = frac{2}{3} b^3 sin^2 72^circ (1 + sin 54^circ) ] 8. **Solving for Ratios:** Using the exact values: [ sin 72^circ = sqrt{frac{5}{8} + frac{sqrt{5}}{8}}, quad sin 54^circ = frac{1}{4}(1 + sqrt{5}), quad text{and} quad tan 54^circ = sqrt{1 + frac{2}{sqrt{5}}} ] The resulting expression for simplification gives us: [ b^3 (3 sqrt{5} + 5) = 6 a^3 (sqrt{5} + 2) ] From which: [ frac{a^3}{b^3} = frac{3 sqrt{5} + 5}{6 sqrt{5} + 12} ] Hence, [ frac{a}{b} = sqrt[3]{frac{3 sqrt{5} + 5}{6 sqrt{5} + 12}} ] Approximately: [ frac{a}{b} approx 0.772 ] So, the ratio is: [ boxed{frac{a}{b} = 0.772} ]"},{"prompt":"The distance from the focus of the parabola x^{2}=frac{1}{2}y to its directrix is A: 1 B: frac{1}{2} C: frac{1}{4} D: 4","completion":"**Analysis** This question tests the standard equation of a parabola and its properties, focusing on computational ability.

Therefore, we have N_3 = 6. Next, N_2, the largest number in the 2nd row, has to be one of 5, 4, or 3, because 6 is already in the 3rd row and it cannot be 2 or 1 as they would not satisfy the condition N_1 < N_2 < N_3. If N_2 = 2, the other number in the second row can only be 1, which would make the single number in the first row greater than 2, hence not satisfying N_1 < N_2 < N_3. For the case when N_2 = 5, N_1 can be 4, 3, 2, or 1. Each selection for N_1 provides us 3 possibilities for the second row and 2 for the first row (since the first row's number must be less than N_2 = 5 and different from the number paired with 5). Multiplying this by the 6 possible arrangements for the third row (since one of the spaces is fixed for the number 6), we have 4 times 3 times 2 times 6 = 144 permutations. When N_2 = 4, N_1 can be 3, 2, or 1. The number 5 must be in the third row, and the two remaining numbers can be arranged in 2 ways in the third row alongside 6. Thus, satisfying permutations for this case amount to 3 times 2 times 2 times 6 = 72. For the last scenario where N_2 = 3, N_1 can be 2 or 1. The number 4 must be in the third row in this case, and there are 6 possible ways to arrange numbers 4, 5, and 6 in the third row. Thus, there are 2 times 6 times 2 times 1 = 24 permutations.

For 2 counters in 20 minutes: 20 times 2y = 20x + n 2.

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate n: [ 40y - 36y = 20x - 12x ] Simplifying, we get: [ 4y = 8x ] Which further simplifies to: [ y = 2x ] 2. Substitute y = 2x into one of the original equations to find a relation between x, y, and n. Using the first equation: [ 40x = 20x + n ] Simplifying, we find: [ 20x = n ] From which we get: [ x = frac{1}{20}n ] And since y = 2x: [ y = frac{2}{20}n = frac{1}{10}n ] # Step 3: Determine the Minimum Number of Checkout Counters To reduce the waiting time to zero within 6 minutes, we use the inequality 6my > 6x + n.

Then Alice's value is 1. - If sin y = cot y = frac{cos y}{sin y}, this implies sin^2 y = cos y. Solving sin^2 y = 1 - sin^2 y gives sin^2 y = frac{1}{2}, so sin y = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, and y = 45^circ. Alice's value is frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. - If cos y = cot y = frac{cos y}{sin y}, we get sin y = 1, which is not possible in (0^circ, 90^circ).

The derivative, f'(x) = 2x - 1, is negative for all x < 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically decreasing in this interval. Since f(x) is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex above the x-axis, it does not intersect the x-axis. - For x geq 0, f(x) = e^x - x. The derivative, f'(x) = e^x - 1, is non-negative, showing that f(x) is monotonically increasing. Given that f(0) = 1, and as x approaches 0 from the left, f(x) approaches 1, we conclude that f(x) does not have any zero points for k=1. Therefore, conclusion ① is correct. For ②, when k < 0, we analyze the function in two parts: - For x < 0, f(x) = kx^2 - x + 1. The derivative, f'(x) = 2kx - 1, changes sign at x = frac{1}{2k}, indicating a single critical point in this interval. Since f(x) approaches -infty as x approaches -infty, and f(0) = 1, the function must cross the x-axis exactly once when x < 0. - For x geq 0, f(x) = e^x - kx. The derivative, f'(x) = e^x - k, is always positive since e^x > k for k < 0. This means f(x) is monotonically increasing for x geq 0, and since it starts from f(0) = 1, it does not cross the x-axis in this interval. Thus, conclusion ② is correct. For ③, let's choose k = 2e: - For x < 0, f(x) = 2ex^2 - x + 1. The derivative, f'(x) = 4ex - 1, is always negative, indicating that f(x) is monotonically decreasing and does not have any zero points in this interval. - For x geq 0, f(x) = e^x - 2ex. The derivative, f'(x) = e^x - 2e, changes sign at x = 2, showing a transition from decreasing to increasing behavior. Since f(2) < 0 and f(0) = 1, f(x) must cross the x-axis twice in this interval. Therefore, conclusion ③ is correct. For ④, considering the previous analysis, we deduce that for k > 0, the function f(x) cannot have three zero points since it is either monotonically decreasing or increasing in each interval, and the changes in monotonicity do not allow for three intersections with the x-axis.

Denote ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) as the centers of ( Omega_1 ) and ( Omega_2 ) respectively. 4. **Analyzing the tangent properties:** Since ( O_1D = O_1C ) and ( angle O_1DG = angle O_1CG = 90^circ ), it follows that ( O_1 ) is the midpoint of the shorter arc of the circumcircle of ( triangle CDG ). The center ( O_2 ) lies on the angle bisector of ( angle CGD ) since ( Omega_2 ) touches both ( GC ) and ( GD ). Since ( O_2 ) also lies on ( Omega_1 ), from Lemma 1, we conclude ( O_2 ) is either the incenter or an excenter of ( triangle CDG ). Therefore, ( Omega_2 ) touches ( CD ) in both cases. 5. **Verification using homothety:** Let ( O ) be the center of ( Gamma ) (i.e., ( Omega )), and ( r, r_1, r_2 ) be the radii of ( Gamma, Gamma_1, Gamma_2 ) respectively. We need to show ( d(O_2, CD) = r_2 ). A homothety centered at ( M ) with ratio ( frac{r}{r_1} ) maps ( Gamma_1, C, D ) to ( Gamma, A, B ) respectively, thus ( CD parallel AB ), and: [ d(C, AB) = frac{r - r_1}{r} d(M, AB) ] Let ( O_1O_2 ) intersect ( XY ) at ( R ). Then: [ d(O_2, CD) = O_2R + frac{r - r_1}{r} d(M, AB) ] Given: [ O_1O_2 = r_1, O_1X = r_1, OX = r - r_1, OO_2 = r - r_2, O_2X = r_2 ] Using the cosine law: [ cos angle O_1OO_2 = frac{2r_1^2 - 2rr_1 + 2rr_2 - r_2^2}{2r_1(r - r_2)} ] [ O_2R = frac{r_2^2}{2r_1} ] Substituting these back: [ d(O_2, CD) = r_2 ] Thus, ( boxed{text{the circle } Omega_2 text{ is tangent to } CD.} )"},{"prompt":"Suppose that a cows give b gallons of milk in c days.

Similarly, the circumcircle of triangle ( ABD ) maps to another circle (or line) passing through ( A ).

(2) Since a_{n+1} = frac{a_n}{a_n + 4}, we have frac{1}{a_{n+1}} = frac{a_n + 4}{a_n} = 4cdotfrac{1}{a_n} + 1, thus frac{1}{a_{n+1}} - frac{1}{3} = 4left( frac{1}{a_n} - frac{1}{3}right). This means that the sequence left{frac{1}{a_n} - frac{1}{3}right} is a geometric sequence with the first term frac{4}{3} - frac{1}{3} = 1 and common ratio 4. Therefore, we have frac{1}{a_n} - frac{1}{3} = 4^{n-1}, and thus frac{1}{a_n} = 4^{n-1} + frac{1}{3} = frac{4^n}{3}, which implies a_n = frac{3}{4^n - 1}.

Subtracting this from T_n yields frac{1}{2}T_n = 3left(frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2^2} + ldots + frac{1}{2^n} - frac{n}{2^{n+1}}right) = 3left(1 - frac{1}{2^n} - frac{n}{2^{n+1}}right), so 2^{n-1}T_n = 3left(2^n - 1 - frac{n}{2}right).

This simplifies to 1 < frac{1}{ω}(k + frac{1}{3}) < 2, which implies ω < k + frac{1}{3} < 2ω. This leads to the system of inequalities: begin{cases} ω < k + frac{1}{3} ω > frac{k}{2} + frac{1}{6}end{cases} Since k + frac{1}{3} > 0, we have k > -frac{1}{3}. When k = 0, frac{1}{6} < ω < frac{1}{3}, and when k = 1, frac{2}{3} < ω < frac{4}{3}. Given that 0 < ω < 1, we have frac{2}{3} < ω < 1. In conclusion, the range of ω values is (frac{1}{6}, frac{1}{3}) ∪ (frac{2}{3}, 1). Therefore, the answer is boxed{(frac{1}{6}, frac{1}{3}) ∪ (frac{2}{3}, 1)}.

Prove that the cells in the corners of the board are painted in different colors. 1. **General Approach:** - We will use induction to prove the statement for a general (2m times 2n) board. - First, we'll define our base case and prove it. - Then, we'll assume the statement is true for smaller boards to prove it for a larger board. 2. **Base Case:** - Consider a (2 times 2) board. - The board can be represented as follows, where each letter represents a different color: [ begin{array}{|c|c|} hline A & B hline C & D hline end{array} ] - Given the coloring rules, each corner cell must be a different color. - Therefore, the statement holds true for the base case of a (2 times 2) board. 3. **Inductive Step:** - Assume the statement is true for all boards of size (2m' times 2n') where (m' < m) and (n' < n). - Now, consider a (2m times 2n) board. - Divide the (2m times 2n) board into four (m times n) sub-boards. Label these sub-boards as (T_1, T_2, T_3,) and (T_4). - Each (m times n) sub-board can be colored such that no two cells of the same color share a vertex within that sub-board. 4. **Verification of colors in corners:** - Consider the four boards: - (T_1) (top-left) - (T_2) (top-right) - (T_3) (bottom-left) - (T_4) (bottom-right) - Let the top-left corners of (T_1, T_2, T_3,) and (T_4) be (C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4) respectively. These are the original corners of the (2m times 2n) board. - By the induction hypothesis, each sub-board ( (m times n) ) must have different colors at its corners. - The key idea is that the original corners (C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4) are corners from different sub-boards. - Therefore, the corners of the (2m times 2n) board will be colored differently. 5. **Conclusion:** - By induction, the statement holds true for any sub-board as well as the (100 times 100) board. Therefore, the corner cells of the (100 times 100) board must be colored in different colors as no two cells of the same color share a vertex.

So, the profit per loom is: Profit per loom = Sales contribution per loom - Manufacturing expense per loom Profit per loom = (Rs 5,00,000 / L) - (Rs 1,50,000 / L) When one loom breaks down, the sales decrease by the sales contribution of one loom, and the manufacturing expenses decrease by the manufacturing expense of one loom. However, the establishment charges remain the same. The decrease in profit due to one loom breaking down is Rs 3,500. Decrease in profit = Sales contribution per loom - Manufacturing expense per loom Rs 3,500 = (Rs 5,00,000 / L) - (Rs 1,50,000 / L) Now, let's solve for L: Rs 3,500 = (Rs 5,00,000 - Rs 1,50,000) / L Rs 3,500 = Rs 3,50,000 / L L = Rs 3,50,000 / Rs 3,500 L = 100 Therefore, the firm employs boxed{100} looms."},{"prompt":"Thirdgrade students went to a concert in 12 buses.

Additionally, one of the digits must be 5. The number must have two even and two odd digits, including the 5. Since the sum of the digits must be divisible by 9 and must include a 5, consider the other digits must sum to a number which, adding 5, is the smallest multiple of 9 greater than or equal to the minimum sum 18 (as the number needs to be more than 1000). Thus, the next suitable sum is 18. Therefore, the rest of the digits need to sum to 18 - 5 = 13. To achieve the smallest number, start with the thousands digit as 1 (smallest possible). Then, the hundreds digit should be 0 to minimize the number. Now, with digits 1, 0, and 5, we need another digit that along with 5 sums to 13. Let's consider the possibilities: - If the additional digit is 9 (odd), it works since the pair (5, 9) sums to 14, but we are 1 over what is needed.

Let's rearrange: - We choose (1, 0, 5, 4): 1 (odd) + 0 (even) + 5 (odd) + 4 (even) = 10. Still incorrect, the sum must be boosted. Let’s try (1, 0, 5, 8): - 1 (odd), 0 (even), 5 (odd), 8 (even) sums to 14. Sum 14 is closest but keep the highest digit in lowest position. Let’s adjust to (1, 5, 0, 4): 1 (odd), 5 (odd), 0 (even), 4 (even) = 10. Then the optimal setup seems to be (1, 8, 5, 0) or (1, 0, 5, 8), summing correctly to 14.

(2) The probability that at least one of the three trains arrives on time.","completion":"To solve these problems, we compute probabilities using the concept of independence and the complementary probability. (1) To find the probability that exactly two of the three trains arrive on time, we need to consider all possible scenarios where two trains are on time, and one is not.

الثقافات والأشخاص وحتى السياقات الشخصية. في بعض التقاليد، قد تُعتبر القطط السوداء رمزًا للحظ السيء أو المشاعر السلبية مثل الخوف أو القلق. بيد أنها في تقاليد أخرى، قد تُشير إلى الحماية، القوة، أو حتى الحظ الجيد. إذا كانت القطة السوداء في الحلم مرتبطة بشخص معين، فقد يتوقف تفسير ذلك الربط على العديد من العوامل، بما في ذلك: 1. **المشاعر نحو القطة**: هل كانت مشاعرك تجاه القطة في الحلم إيجابية أم سلبية؟ إذا كنت تشعر بالراحة والأمان بوجود القطة، قد يشير ذلك إلى ثقة أو ارتباط إيجابي مع الشخص المعني. إذا كانت المشاعر سلبية، قد يعبر ذلك عن مخاوف أو شكوك بخصوص هذا الشخص. 2. **علاقتك بالشخص في الواقع**: إذا كان الشخص المرتبط بالقطة السوداء في الحلم شخصًا تعرفه جيدًا ولديك علاقة وثيقة معه، فقد يكون الحلم يعبر عن مشاعر أو أفكار لديك تجاه هذا الشخص. الحلم قد يكون انعكاسًا لكيفية تأثير هذا الشخص على حياتك العاطفية أو النفسية. 3. **السياق العام للحلم**: الأحلام غالبًا ما تكون رمزية، وسياق الحلم يمكن أن يقدم دلائل حول كيفية تفسير ظهور القطة السوداء وارتباطها بالشخص المعين. على سبيل المثال، الإجراءات التي تقوم بها القطة أو الشخص في الحلم قد تشير إلى الديناميكيات أو المشاعر المعقدة في علاقاتك. 4. **الإسقاطات الشخصية**: في بعض الأحيان، قد تمثل الشخصيات والرموز في أحلامنا جوانب من أنفسنا أو إسقاطات لمشاعرنا ورغباتنا. هل يمكن أن يمثل الشخص المرتبط بالقطة السوداء جانبًا من شخصيتك أو حياتك تجده مخفيًا أو غامضًا؟ تذكر أن تفسير الأحلام هو عملية شخصية وغالبًا ما تكون أكثر تأثيرًا

كيفية التفكير أو الشعور. تحديدًا، حلاقة الشعر للتخلص من القمل يمكن أن يعبر عن رغبة الحالم في حل المشاكل أو التخلص من الأعباء والمسائل المزعجة في حياته. من وجهة نظر نفسية، قد يشير الحلم إلى الحاجة إلى التطهير أو التنقية من الأمور التي تعتبر مصدر إزعاج أو توتر. إنها دعوة للتفكير في الجوانب السلبية أو الأشخاص الذين قد يسببون لك التوتر والبحث عن طرق للتخلص منهم من حياتك للتقدم بشكل إيجابي. بالطبع، تفسير الأحلام هو فن ذو طبيعة شخصية للغاية، والمعاني يمكن أن تختلف بشكل كبير بناءً على تجارب الحالم الفردية ومشاعره. إذا وجدت الحلم مزعجًا أو متكررًا، قد يكون مفيدًا التفكير في جوانب حياتك الحالية التي

While there might not be a universally recognized term specifically for fingerprints, the general principle could be described by the concept of \\"overcompensation leading to distinctiveness\\" or a form of \\"unintended conspicuousness.\\" In the realm of digital security, a related concept is \\"security through obscurity\\", which sometimes backfires in a way that could align with what you're describing – efforts to obscure or protect an asset making it more of a target or unexpectedly easier to compromise due to the peculiarities of the security measures taken. In a more specific context related to uniqueness and identification, such as with biometric data including fingerprints, overly manipulating or attempting to alter one's biometric data could indeed make those modifications themselves distinctive markers. However, there isn't a widely recognized, specific term for making oneself more exposed or easy to detect through efforts to be unique in terms of fingerprint obfuscation.

Сезонная аллергия, также известная как аллергический ринит или поллиноз, оказывает влияние на многие аспекты экономики, включая здравоохранение, производительность труда и качество жизни населения. 1. **Расходы на здравоохранение**: Одним из наиболее очевидных экономических последствий сезонной аллергии являются расходы на лечение. Это включает в себя стоимость приема врачей, диагностических тестов, лекарств (как безрецептурных, так и тех, что выдаются по рецепту) и иногда госпитализации. В некоторых странах данные расходы могут быть частично или полностью покрыты государством или страховыми компаниями, что также отражается в экономической нагрузке на общество. 2. **Потеря производительности**: Сезонная аллергия может снижать производительность труда как в краткосрочной перспективе (из-за болезненных симптомов, вроде заложенности носа, чихания, зуда и слезоточивости глаз, которые мешают сосредоточению и выполнению повседневных задач), так и в долгосрочной перспективе (повышенное количество больничных дней и увольнений по состоянию здоровья). Ухудшение общего состояния здоровья людей, страдающих от сезонной аллергии, может привести к снижению качества их работы. 3. **Образование**: Аллергия может влиять и на успеваемость учащихся. Дети и подростки, страдающие сезонной аллергией, могут испытывать трудности с концентрацией внимания, посещаемостью и выполнением школьных заданий в периоды обострения аллергии. 4. **Качество жизни**: Хотя это менее очевидный экономический аспект, снижение качества жизни людей с аллергией также накладывает косвенные экономические расходы. Более низкое качество жизни может привести к снижению общей эффективности и производительности, увеличению расходов на лекарства и медицинское обслуживание, а также к потере трудоспособности. Различные исследования и отчеты пытаются оценить экономический ущерб от сезонной аллергии в конкретных денежных величинах. Например, в США, согласно некоторым оценкам, общие годовые расходы, связанные с аллергическим ринитом, могут достигать миллиардов долларов, учитывая как прямые медицинские расходы, так и потери производительности. Однако следует помнить, что данные оценки могут сильно отличаться в зависимости от используемых методов исследования, а также от года к году с учетом изменения стоимости лечения, степени распространенности аллергии и других факторов."},{"prompt":"Есть ли данные по России про это","completion":"Конкретные данные об экономическом ущербе от сезонной аллергии в России требуют детальных исследований и оценок, которые могли бы учитывать специфику распространения аллергических заболеваний в стране, а также особенности местной системы здравоохранения и социально-экономического контекста. Однако, до момента моего последнего обновления в 2023 году, подобная информация в открытом доступе встречается нечасто. Несмотря на это, можно выделить несколько общих аспектов, которые потенциально влияют на экономику России в контексте сезонной аллергии: 1. **Медицинское обслуживание**: Расходы на диагностику и лечение аллергии, включая покупку медикаментов, консультации аллергологов и лечебные процедуры, нагружают как пациентов, так и систему здравоохранения в целом. 2. **Снижение производительности**: Аллергия может негативно сказываться на производительности работников ввиду ухудшения их самочувствия и необходимости брать больничные. Это может приводить к прямым и косвенным экономическим потерям для отдельных предприятий и экономики страны в целом. 3. **Образовательный аспект**: У детей и подростков, страдающих сезонной аллергией, могут возникать трудности с учебой в периоды обострения заболевания, что влияет на их образовательные результаты и может иметь долгосрочные последствия для их будущего. Для получения более точной информации по вопросу экономического ущерба от сезонной аллергии в России желательно обратиться к специализированным исследованиям, статистике Министерства здравоохранения РФ, работам российских аллергологов и экономистов, которые могли бы учитывать все релевантные факторы и предоставить более конкретные данные."},{"prompt":"А в целом от аллергии какой экономический ущерб у России, какие есть данные","completion":"На момент последнего обновления в 2023 году, специфические данные о полном экономическом ущербе от всех форм аллергии в России в открытом доступе представлены ограниченно. Экономический ущерб от аллергии в широком смысле включает не только прямые медицинские расходы на диагностику, лечение и профилактику аллергических заболеваний, но и косвенные потери, связанные с временной утратой трудоспособности, снижением качества жизни, ухудшением образовательных результатов и т.д. Однако можно выделить несколько ключевых аспектов, которые вместе формируют экономическую нагрузку от аллергии на общество: # 1. **Прямые медицинские расходы** - **Лечение**: Сюда входят расходы на медикаменты, визиты к врачам, госпитализацию и специализированные процедуры для борьбы с аллергическими реакциями. - **Диагностика**: Расходы на аллергологические тесты и анализы, необходимые для точного определения аллергенов. # 2. **Косвенные расходы** - **Потеря трудоспособности**: Включает временную нетрудоспособность или снижение производительности на работе из-за аллергических реакций. - **Ухудшение качества жизни**: Хотя этот аспект сложно квантифицировать в экономических терминах, он влияет на общестроительную продуктивность и способность к образованию. # 3. **Долгосрочные последствия** - **Образование**: Аллергии у детей могут влиять на их способность к обучению и участию в школьных мероприятиях, потенциально влияя на их будущие образовательные и профессиональные достижения. - **Хроническое заболевание**: Неконтролируемая аллергия может привести к развитию хронических заболеваний, таких как астма, что увеличивает медицинские и социальные расходы. Экономические исследования в области аллергии часто требуют комплексного подхода для оценки всех связанных затрат. Исследователям необходимо учитывать различные факторы, включая географические, социальные и экономические условия страны. Для получения точных и актуальных данных по России их можно искать в специализированных исследованиях, публикациях аллергологических и здравоохранительных органов, аналитических отчетах и научных журналах."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The Android Studio's built-in migration tool can assist with this process: \`Refactor\` > \`Migrate to AndroidX\`."},{"prompt":"dont migrate to androidx","completion":"If you're not planning to migrate to AndroidX and wish to resolve possible issues within the context of the original support library environment, here are a few tips tailored to the code and environment you're working with. Keep in mind, however, that sticking to the older support libraries while the ecosystem moves forward may limit the functionality and compatibility of your app in the future. Given the constraints, the original code you've provided looks mostly correct for an environment not yet migrated to AndroidX. However, let's address a couple of potential issues or areas for clarification to ensure smooth operation in a non-AndroidX project. # Potential Issues and Clarifications 1. **Deprecation of \`InstrumentationRegistry.getTargetContext()\`:** Even in a non-AndroidX project, Android might have deprecated certain methods. The method \`InstrumentationRegistry.getTargetContext()\` from the older \`android.support.test\` package was commonly used but could show deprecation based on the version of the testing library you're using. 2. **Correct Import Statements:** For a non-AndroidX project, ensure you're using the correct import statements that reference the older \`android.support.test\` packages. Here's your original code with comments on each part to ensure its compatibility as is: \`\`\`java package com.medicdigital.jjpodcasts; import android.support.test.InstrumentationRegistry; import android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnit4; import org.junit.Test; import org.junit.runner.RunWith; import org.junit.Assert.*; /** * Instrumented test, which will execute on an Android device. * * See [testing documentation](http://d.android.com/tools/testing). */ @RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class) class ExampleInstrumentedTest { @Test public void useAppContext() { // Context of the app under test. // This should still work if you are using a version where it's not deprecated. // Ensure your testing libraries are not too outdated to avoid runtime issues. val appContext = InstrumentationRegistry.getTargetContext(); assertEquals(\\"com.medicdigital.jjpodcasts\\", appContext.getPackageName()); } } \`\`\` # Considerations: - **Check Your Gradle Configuration:** Make sure the version of the support test libraries in your \`build.gradle (app)\` file doesn't inadvertently update to a version expecting AndroidX, causing incompatibilities. For the support library, versions should be consistent and not mixed with \`androidx\` artifacts. - **Version Compatibility:** The Android ecosystem evolves rapidly, and many libraries are updated to work best with AndroidX. Even if you do not migrate now, consider scheduling it for the future to ensure compatibility and access to new features. - **Refer to Official Documentation:** Since technology and libraries get updated, the official Android developer documentation is your best source for resolving specific deprecation notices and recommended practices. In summary, your original approach should still work given you're aligned with the correct versioning for the support library environment. However, do keep an eye on deprecation warnings and consider planning for a migration to AndroidX in the future."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

While initially a key figure in the transformation of China from an imperial system to a republic, his tenure in power is marked by several major failures, which have had long-lasting consequences for China. Here are some of the principal failures associated with Yuan Shikai: 1. **Failure to Consolidate Republican Rule**: After the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, which led to the abdication of the Qing Dynasty, Yuan Shikai became the Provisional President of the Republic of China. However, instead of consolidating the nascent republic, Yuan utilized autocratic methods to solidify his control, undermining the democratic ideals of the revolution. 2. **Betrayal of the Republican Cause**: Yuan was instrumental in the negotiations that led to the abdication of the Qing Emperor. Initially, he was perceived as a crucial republican leader. However, his lust for power and control soon became evident. He dissolved the Nationalist Party (KMT), censored the press, and employed secret police, which betrayed the republican cause and led to widespread discontent. 3. **Attempting to Declare Himself Emperor**: Perhaps the most glaring failure was Yuan's attempt to restore monarchy in China by declaring himself the Emperor of China in 1915. This move was met with immediate resistance and widespread revolt across the country, weakening his rule. It demonstrated his disconnection from the prevailing political sentiments and severely undermined the stability of the nation. 4. **Warlord Era Precipitation**: As a consequence of Yuan Shikai's actions, especially his attempt to become emperor and his suppression of opposition, he is often credited with contributing significantly to the fragmentation of China into a period known as the Warlord Era. After his death, the central government was weakened, and control was taken up by various military leaders across the country, leading to decades of conflict and unrest. 5. **Economic Mismanagement**: Yuan's regime was also marked by economic difficulties. His government faced financial strains largely due to increased military spending and the cost of suppression of revolts. Yuan's attempt to centralize tax collection was met with resistance, and his efforts to secure foreign loans to support his regime further indebted the country. 6. **Undermining the Nationalist Movement**: Yuan’s suppression of the Nationalist Party and his attempt to monopolize power not only caused immediate political fragmentation but also disrupted the momentum of the nationalist movement, delaying the unification and modernization of China. 7. **Intervention and Influence of Foreign Powers**: Under Yuan's leadership, foreign powers, particularly Japan, were able to exert a significant influence on Chinese politics. The Twenty-One Demands made by Japan in 1915, which Yuan was forced to accept partially, were viewed as an infringement on China's sovereignty and national dignity. Yuan Shikai's failures not only destabilized China in the short term but also had profound implications for its future development, contributing to prolonged periods of strife and making the task of national unification and modernization significantly more challenging."},{"prompt":"Artificial Flowers Eucalyptus Leaf Babys Breath Gypsophila Bouquets Wedding Party Home Decor,Pack of 1(White), create a title with the prefix 'best', one liner, only strings, less than 100 characters only","completion":"\\"Best Faux Eucalyptus & Baby's Breath Bouquet for Elegant Home and Wedding Decor\\""},{"prompt":"Best Faux Eucalyptus &amp; Babys Breath Bouquet for Elegant Home and Wedding Decor, generate a personal experience with this, add hash tag at the bottom, less than 700 characters only, only strings, no </br> html","completion":"I recently stumbled upon a stunning faux eucalyptus and baby's breath bouquet that instantly elevated my home decor.

What is ChatGPT? 00:05 - 00:16 ChatGPT, by OpenAI, is a chatbot application, which means it can answer questions or perform tasks based on user-inputted text. This may not sound much different to a 3. What is ChatGPT? 00:16 - 00:45 traditional chatbot, but ChatGPT is much more than that. Traditional chatbots were usually designed to return a predetermined response to a limited number of questions. ChatGPT is far more generalizable, as it uses its understanding of language to interpret the question or task and determine the most appropriate response. This means that ChatGPT has a wide range of potential applications. 4. Generative AI 00:45 - 01:03 ChatGPT uses generative AI to respond to users. Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning, where a model creates new content based on patterns in information it has already seen. 5. From prompt to response 01:03 - 01:11 This is how ChatGPT works: the user writes a question or instruction, which is more generally called a prompt. 6. From prompt to response 01:11 - 01:23 This prompt is passed as an input to the application, which uses its understanding of language to interpret the prompt and generate new, relevant language in response to it. 7. From prompt to response 01:23 - 01:31 Finally, the response is returned to the user. Let's see ChatGPT in action with some examples! 8. Summarizing text 01:31 - 01:45 ChatGPT is great at summarizing text or explaining concepts for a particular audience, which is useful when summarizing reports for different stakeholders or interpreting complex information. 9. Summarizing text 01:45 - 01:51 Let's write a prompt to instruct ChatGPT to summarize generative AI in simple terms. 10. Summarizing text 01:51 - 02:09 ChatGPT responds with a summary that contains very few technical details or jargon while still capturing the key points. This is a good start; however, the summary is quite long. It would be better if we could boil it down to two key sentences. 11. Summarizing text 02:09 - 02:13 We can ask ChatGPT to do just that! 12. Summarizing text 02:13 - 02:35 Notice that we don't have to instruct it to summarize generative AI again; ChatGPT will actually remember the information and context from earlier in the conversation. The ability to remember the conversation history, and for the user to provide follow-up corrections to responses, are two of ChatGPT's most powerful capabilities. 13. Creating marketing content 02:35 - 02:52 Summarizing text or concepts is pretty cool, but ChatGPT can also perform more creative tasks, such as creating marketing content. Let's ask ChatGPT to write a tweet encouraging people to acquire data literacy skills. 14. Creating marketing content 02:52 - 03:22 This tweet is pretty good: ChatGPT came up with a catchy slogan (Unlock the power of data!), considered X's character limit, and utilized relevant hashtags and emojis to improve audience engagement. ChatGPT is already being applied to streamline many different marketing tasks, including creating email templates, writing blog post titles and descriptions, and copyediting large bodies of text. 15. Generating and debugging code 03:22 - 03:40 ChatGPT is also impacting how software engineers, data practitioners, and others write code. ChatGPT is able to generate template code, explain why code isn't working, and even make suggestions for improvements! 16. Why utilize ChatGPT? 03:40 - 04:30 So why should we begin implementing ChatGPT into our workflows and business processes? ChatGPT is able to perform many time-consuming tasks with greater efficiency. Using our own expertise, we can then verify and finalize the responses. This workflow of AI doing the legwork and a human providing the finishing touches saves a substantial amount of time and money. Take the example of using ChatGPT to generate marketing content: this will allow marketers to focus on more complex and nuanced tasks, such as deciding what to market and to whom. Implementing ChatGPT into products will also allow for greater personalization of content, delivering more value to customers. 17.

Limitations of ChatGPT 00:00 - 00:10 Although ChatGPT is a valuable tool that can perform a huge variety of tasks, there are some limitations to be aware of to use it effectively. 2. ChatGPT under the hood 00:10 - 00:36 ChatGPT's text-generation capabilities come from a large language model, or LLM, which sits at the heart of the application. The LLM interprets the prompt and generates relevant text in response based on its understanding of language. To understand some of the limitations of ChatGPT, we'll first need to delve a little deeper into how the LLM works. 3. Demystifying the LLM 00:36 - 00:41 Imagine we've been shown a large and complex building block wall, 4. Demystifying the LLM 00:41 - 00:52 and then we've been given an incomplete wall to finish off in the same style as the large wall. This, in essence, is how ChatGPT works. 5. Demystifying the LLM 00:52 - 01:16 When developing ChatGPT, the LLM was shown a huge amount of text data, which is like the large building block wall. From this data, it develops its understanding of the structure of language by looking at the relation between characters, words, and sentences, which are like the differently-colored building blocks. The data that the model learns from is called 6. Demystifying the LLM 01:16 - 01:27 the training data, and the sheer amount and diversity of data used to train ChatGPT is a large part of its success. The model itself used complex 7. Demystifying the LLM 01:27 - 01:32 algorithms to detect these language patterns in the training data, and it was 8. Demystifying the LLM 01:32 - 01:38 fine-tuned through iterative processes that included rating the quality of the responses. 9. Demystifying the LLM 01:38 - 01:51 So when we provide a prompt to ChatGPT, it is essentially trying to complete a building block wall using its understanding of the training data to generate the words most likely to follow the prompt. 10. Limitation 1 - Knowledge cutoff 01:51 - 02:17 This leads us to our first limitation: ChatGPT was trained on data up to a certain date, which differs depending on the model used. Without being directly provided with additional context, these models will have no knowledge of events passed these dates. As OpenAI updates the LLMs used in ChatGPT, these dates will continue to shift forward. 11. Limitation 2 - Training data bias 02:17 - 02:39 Another limitation is potential bias in the training data. ChatGPT was trained on a massive text dataset from a variety of sources, including books, articles, and websites, but this data could contain biases. The model may learn these biases and produce biased responses. 12. Limitation 3 - Context tracking 02:39 - 02:50 ChatGPT has the ability to build on information and context from earlier in the conversation, so follow-up corrections can be made. However, if the topic of the conversation 13. Limitation 3 - Context tracking 02:50 - 02:52 shifts multiple times, 14. Limitation 3 - Context tracking 02:52 - 03:08 ChatGPT can struggle to keep track of the context and generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses. A good rule of thumb is to keep a conversation to one topic and create new conversations for different topics. 15. Limitation 4 - Hallucination 03:08 - 03:37 Another common issue when interacting with ChatGPT is hallucination, which is when the model confidently tells us inaccurate information. This often occurs when attempting to go beyond ChatGPT's knowledge cutoff or abilities. Hallucinations can be difficult to identify without being able to validate the results, but fortunately, one of the most active areas of LLM development is the identification and reduction of hallucinations. 1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence) 16. Limitation 5 - Legal and ethical considerations 03:37 - 04:02 Let's discuss a limitation on what the user can do. Consider this situation: we ask ChatGPT to write a new song in the style of our favorite artist. ChatGPT generates a song that resembles the style of this artist based on the song lyrics that were present in the training data, but who owns this new song? Is it the user that wrote the prompt, 17. Limitation 5 - Legal and ethical considerations 04:02 - 04:05 the artist that wrote the original lyrics, 18. Limitation 5 - Legal and ethical considerations 04:05 - 04:26 or OpenAI, the creators of ChatGPT? It's easy to fall into one of these legal gray areas if the use cases for ChatGPT aren't properly scoped so that ownership and legal implications are well-understood and accepted. We'll discuss ownership and privacy in much more detail later in the course. prepare notes for me.","completion":"# Notes on the Limitations of ChatGPT Overview - ChatGPT, despite its extensive capabilities, encounters several limitations that affect its effectiveness and application. Understanding the Large Language Model (LLM) - ChatGPT operates through a Large Language Model (LLM) that interprets prompts and generates text based on its training data. - The LLM's performance is akin to completing a complex puzzle based on patterns it learned from a vast array of text data. - Training involves complex algorithms and iterative fine-tuning to produce high-quality responses. Limitation 1: Knowledge Cutoff - ChatGPT's knowledge is limited to the period up to when it was last trained. It lacks awareness of events or developments that occurred after this cutoff date. - The model's knowledge base will gradually become outdated over time without continuous updates. Limitation 2: Training Data Bias - The model may inherit biases from its training data, sourced from books, articles, and websites, potentially leading to biased responses. Limitation 3: Context Tracking - While ChatGPT can maintain the context of a conversation to some extent, it may struggle as the topic shifts, leading to inaccurate or irrelevant responses. - It's recommended to keep conversations topic-focused and initiate new chats for different subjects. Limitation 4: Hallucination - ChatGPT can \\"hallucinate,\\" meaning it may assert incorrect information confidently. - Hallucinations pose challenges for users needing to verify the model's outputs, signaling an area in need of improvement. Limitation 5: Legal and Ethical Considerations - The legal and ethical dimensions of using ChatGPT cover the creation of content (e.g., songs, writings) that mimics the style of existing works. - Ownership of ChatGPT-generated content remains a complex area, involving the user, the inspirations for the content, and OpenAI. - It's crucial to navigate use cases carefully to avoid legal gray areas concerning ownership and privacy. Summary While ChatGPT represents a significant advancement in AI and language models, users must navigate its limitations—including knowledge cutoffs, inherited biases, context tracking challenges, hallucination issues, and legal-ethical considerations—to utilize it effectively. Awareness and understanding of these limitations are essential for maximizing the benefits of ChatGPT while mitigating potential drawbacks."},{"prompt":"give me a list of very simple english sentences for primary school child. e.g. he is a boy","completion":"Here's a list of simple English sentences suitable for a primary school child: 1.

This has never been more appropriate than with using ChatGPT - if the prompt we provide doesn't contain sufficient context or isn't written in an easily-interpretable way, chances are it will lower the quality of the response. 3. How does ChatGPT interpret a prompt? 00:00 - 00:00 To begin forming a set of guiding principles for writing effective prompts, let's discuss how ChatGPT interprets prompts using an example. Here, we're asking ChatGPT to write a job description for a data scientist based in New York. 4. How does ChatGPT interpret a prompt? 00:00 - 00:00 First, ChatGPT identifies the broad topic of the prompt. In this case, the phrases job description, data scientist, and New York help the model identify that the prompt is about a job description for a specific role and location. 5. How does ChatGPT interpret a prompt? 00:00 - 00:00 Next, ChatGPT attempts to understand what the prompt is requesting. In this case, the verb, write, and job description indicate the task being given to ChatGPT. Data scientist and New York provide additional context to help populate the response with relevant information. 6. How does ChatGPT interpret a prompt? 00:00 - 00:00 Finally, the response is generated. This isn't bad for a first draft with little specific context. More context could be added to the prompt for greater personalization, such as key role-specific skills and company culture information. Let's use this understanding to begin thinking about best practices for writing prompts. 7. Prompt engineering 00:00 - 00:00 Prompt engineering is the process of writing prompts to maximize the quality and relevance of the response. Prompt engineering is a whole topic in itself, so in this video, we'll present the foundational best practices to get the most out of our ChatGPT prompts. 8. Writing tips for prompt engineering 00:00 - 00:00 The first guideline is to be clear and specific. This sounds like common sense, but we need to ensure that the prompt contains all of the necessary context to create the desired response. One common ChatGPT use case is asking it to summarize a passage of text. In the prompt, we should specify roughly how long we want the resulting summary to be: one page, one paragraph, or even one sentence. Second, keep prompts concise. This means removing any unnecessary information or linguistic frills that don't provide extra context for the task at hand - these extras will only dilute the important information and keywords. Finally, use correct grammar and spelling in prompts. ChatGPT uses grammar to interpret the task, so make sure to include it in all the right places. 9. Provide examples if necessary... 00:00 - 00:00 Another way to superpower our prompts is to provide examples. In many cases, this is a much quicker way of providing extra context than writing a comprehensive explanation of the desired results. For example, let's use ChatGPT to create a list of example customer names, ages, and occupations that we can use to test our internal systems. We want the results in a very specific format: the full name and age separated by a comma, followed by the occupation in brackets. We should provide an example in the prompt so ChatGPT understands exactly what we're asking for. 10. Provide examples if necessary... 00:00 - 00:00 In our prompt, we specify the instruction and also provide the example, John Smith, 34, and Builder in brackets. 11. Provide examples if necessary... 00:00 - 00:00 Because of the example in the prompt, ChatGPT outputs exactly what we want and in the format that we wanted it. use above transcript and prepare me notes","completion":"# Notes on Effective Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT Understanding the Importance of Quality Input - The principle of \\"garbage in, garbage out\\" is crucial when interacting with ChatGPT.

Enabling people to use ChatGPT 00:00 - 00:10 Great work so far! In this chapter, we'll focus on when to use ChatGPT and how to scale its adoption safely and responsibly. 2. Augmenting workflows 00:10 - 00:43 In any role, we develop workflows to achieve some end goal through a standardized series of tasks. These workflows are often molded through years of experience, experimentation, and innovation to achieve a high-quality end goal in a timely manner. These workflows inevitably contain some time-consuming and repetitive tasks, but many of these can now be performed by ChatGPT. These augmented workflows can ultimately improve the quality and timeliness of the end goal. 3. A standard workflow 00:43 - 01:15 Let's say that we've been scoping a complex project, and the resulting document is thirty pages long. We need to summarize the key findings for other stakeholders, so we decide whether the project gets the go-ahead. The standard workflow here would be for us to scan through the document, extract the key findings, and compile the summary by hand. Then, we might use a spelling and grammar checker to proofread. This process is extremely time-consuming, and minus the spellchecker, we had to do most of the legwork. 4. A ChatGPT-powered workflow 01:15 - 01:41 With ChatGPT, the roles of people and technology in this workflow can be reversed. We can ask ChatGPT to summarize the document for us with a well-engineered prompt; then, we proofread the final review for accuracy before sending. This relatively small change provides time savings and allows us to focus our time on more creative and higher-value tasks. 5. Who can use ChatGPT? 01:41 - 02:08 So who can benefit from ChatGPT-powered workflows, and which industries? A business is made up of many roles with vastly different workflows, considerations, and measurable outputs. Marketing often generates public-facing content, HR handles sensitive data on personnel, and technical roles in IT, data, or software engineering write complex code or design systems. Fortunately, 6. ChatGPT can deliver value to everyone! 02:08 - 02:29 all industries and roles can benefit from integrating ChatGPT into their workflows! ChatGPT's contribution will differ significantly from role to role, and there are some ownership and privacy considerations that we'll discuss later in the course, but let's take a look at some common use cases for these roles. 7. Leaders 02:29 - 02:56 Business leaders not only make key decisions to steer the direction of the company but need to communicate the vision and direction to the wider business. Leaders can use ChatGPT to help compose emails, draft presentations, brainstorm strategic ideas, and summarize meeting notes. In these cases, it's still advisable to verify the generated content depending on the complexity and stakes involved. 8. Technical roles 02:56 - 03:22 Software engineers, data practitioners, and other technical roles spend a lot of their time writing code, and the typical workflow often includes repetitive tasks like looking up code syntax and writing documentation. These roles can use ChatGPT to recall code syntax and generate examples, explain code, troubleshoot errors, and even write documentation to accompany the code. 9. HR and people teams 03:22 - 03:34 HR and people teams can use ChatGPT to brainstorm initiatives for improving employee engagement and well-being and allow them to communicate more effectively and efficiently with other employees. 10.

Coming up... 00:02 - 00:23 Deciding when it's appropriate to use ChatGPT isn't easy and requires considering ChatGPT's capabilities and limitations and the requirements of the use case. In this video, we'll provide a framework in the form of key questions to validate the suitability of ChatGPT for a particular use case. 3. Validating a use case 00:23 - 00:47 The first question to ask ourselves is if we require a high degree of accuracy in the response? ChatGPT can be inaccurate, and there's no predictability in its response, so two people providing the same prompt often get different responses. If the use case requires certainty in the quality of the response, such as government policy advisory, 4. Validating a use case 00:47 - 00:50 ChatGPT would be an unsafe option. 5. Validating a use case 00:50 - 01:09 Next, we should evaluate whether someone is able to verify the quality of the response. This is where subject matter expertise still plays a huge part in the workflow. A good rule of thumb is to not ask ChatGPT to do something that we couldn't do ourselves given enough time. 6. Validating a use case 01:09 - 01:18 If we can't verify the correctness or quality of the result, it would be irresponsible to begin using it to drive decisions or surfacing it to customers. 7. Validating a use case 01:18 - 01:26 The use case may require inputting sensitive data, such as customer's personal information or company source code. 1 https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use 8. Validating a use case 01:26 - 01:48 Enabling a use case involving sensitive data is difficult. We need to acquire the necessary consent to process the data, as well as ensuring that the applicable data governance laws, such as GDPR or CCPA, are being adhered to. For these use cases, it's best to seek legal counsel that specializes in data governance. 9. Validating a use case 01:48 - 01:58 Finally, ask whether ownership over the response is required. Ownership will likely be required if we intend to generate revenue from the response. 10. Validating a use case 01:58 - 02:18 Providing that users comply with OpenAI's terms of use, they can claim ownership over the output in many cases, but other considerations, such as copyright infringement, may prevent ownership. We'll dive deeper into the legalities and ethics of using ChatGPT a little later in the course. 1 https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use 11. Validating a use case 02:18 - 02:28 If the use case doesn't require ownership, dive right in and begin testing! Let's apply this framework to evaluate some use cases. 12. Example 1: Brainstorming ideas in HR 02:28 - 03:13 Let's say we're an HR manager concerned with recent employee survey results, which have shown a decrease in overall employee happiness. We'd like to brainstorm ideas for improving employee well-being and ask ChatGPT for suggestions. Is this a suitable use case? As we're only looking for suggestions, we don't require a high degree of correctness in the results, and as an HR manager, we can use our expertise to verify the quality the responses to ensure they align with company values. Finally, sensitive data isn't required, and we won't be using the generated text, so don't require ownership. This is a suitable use case for ChatGPT! 13. Example 2: Healthcare recommendations 03:13 - 03:56 Let's now say that we work for a major healthcare provider, and to alleviate increasing wait times to see a doctor, we want to provide an online treatment recommendation system built on ChatGPT. People will input their symptoms, and ChatGPT would be used to provide the best course of action: taking over-the-counter medication, consulting with a doctor, or visiting the hospital. Is this a suitable use of ChatGPT? This use case requires a high level of precision due to the potentially serious implications of incorrect recommendations, and ChatGPT cannot provide this certainty. This is an unsuitable application of ChatGPT. here is the transcript. prepare college notes from it.","completion":"# College Notes on Validating Use Cases for ChatGPT Introduction to Use Case Validation for ChatGPT Understanding when and how to effectively use ChatGPT involves analyzing both the capabilities and limitations of the AI model, alongside the specific needs of the intended use case. A structured framework of key questions aids in determining the appropriateness of ChatGPT for diverse applications. Key Considerations for Use Case Validation 1. **Accuracy Requirement**: - ChatGPT may produce variable and sometimes inaccurate responses to identical prompts from different users. - Use cases demanding high accuracy (e.g., government policy advisory) are deemed unsuitable for ChatGPT. 2. **Verification Ability**: - The ability to verify the quality and correctness of ChatGPT's responses is essential. - Tasks should ideally not be assigned to ChatGPT if the user cannot independently confirm the output's accuracy. 3. **Sensitivity of Data**: - Use cases requiring the input of sensitive data (personal customer information, proprietary company code, etc.) necessitate careful consideration. - Compliance with data governance laws (GDPR, CCPA) and obtaining necessary consent are paramount, often requiring legal counsel. 4. **Ownership Necessity**: - Determining if ownership of ChatGPT's outputs is required, especially in contexts aiming to generate revenue from those outputs. - Users must navigate copyright and other legal considerations even when OpenAI's terms permit claiming output ownership. Practical Use Case Examples 1. **Brainstorming in HR**: - Scenario: An HR manager seeks to improve employee happiness based on survey feedback. - Evaluation: Low need for accuracy, possible to verify suggestions, no sensitive data involved, and no ownership concern. - Verdict: Suitable use case for ChatGPT. 2. **Healthcare Recommendations**: - Scenario: Creating an online system for treatment recommendations based on patient-input symptoms. - Evaluation: High accuracy needed due to health implications, but ChatGPT cannot guarantee this level of precision. - Verdict: Unsuitable use case for ChatGPT. Conclusion The validation framework for utilizing ChatGPT underscores the importance of a nuanced approach to integrating AI tools into business or operational processes. Key factors such as the necessity of accurate outputs, the potential inclusion of sensitive information, the ability to verify responses, and the requirement of ownership all play critical roles in assessing suitability. By applying these considerations, entities can make informed decisions about harnessing ChatGPT's capabilities in a manner that aligns with their objectives and regulatory obligations."},{"prompt":"2. Ownership and privacy 00:04 - 00:22 Ownership and privacy are two key considerations when scoping ChatGPT's suitability for a particular use case. Neglecting to consider these factors, especially for companies, can bring with it financial penalties, lawsuits, and damage to customer trust and brand image. 3. Who owns the response? 00:22 - 00:38 We'll first discuss the response, as this is ultimately how value will be delivered to users. Establishing ownership over the response is crucial, especially if we intend on integrating ChatGPT into revenue-generating products. 4. Who owns the response? 00:38 - 00:54 As stated in OpenAI's terms of use, providing that users comply with the terms or use and any applicable laws, they can claim ownership to the output. This is great, but before we begin celebrating, let's dig a little deeper into these terms. 1 https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use 5. Who owns the response? 00:54 - 01:46 First, we cannot claim ownership over responses that are considered non-unique, as they can also be generated for other users. If we use a prompt with a small number of likely responses, such as asking factual questions or requesting very short pieces of text, we cannot claim ownership over the response. Second, we can't claim that responses from ChatGPT were human-generated. For products or tools built on top of ChatGPT, we'll need to ensure that customers aren't under the misapprehension that the generated content is human-generated. Finally, ChatGPT can't be used to infringe on a person's rights, which includes copyright infringement. OpenAI update their terms of use fairly regularly, so be sure to double-check them before giving the green light. 1 https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use 6. Ownership and copyright 01:46 - 02:02 Copyright prevents people from using intellectual property without prior consent from the owner. If AI-generated content bears similarity to content protected by copyright, we're at risk of receiving an infringement claim from the owner of the IP. 7. Who owns the prompt? 02:02 - 02:06 Now let's discuss ownership over the prompt! 8. Who owns the prompt? 02:06 - 02:19 As we might expect, OpenAI's terms state that the user owns the input as far as permitted by the law. Although this addresses ownership over the prompt, there are other considerations to be aware of. 1 https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use 9. Prompt privacy 02:19 - 02:51 OpenAI are continuously developing ChatGPT to improve its performance, and one way this is being achieved is by analyzing user's prompts and responses. If we're interacting with ChatGPT via the browser, and don't want this data being used for performance improvements, we'll need to opt-out in the privacy settings. Inputting sensitive data without the proper consent could risk breaching data governance laws, so it's always important to check the specific terms and applicable laws. 1 https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use 10. Data governance 02:51 - 03:25 Data governance laws govern how data and information can be collected, stored, and used to protect people's personal data. One of the biggest and most established data governance laws is GDPR, which governs data usage impacting EU citizens and residents. Data governance laws already place restrictions on how sensitive data can be used, so any use case for ChatGPT must not only satisfy OpenAI's terms of use but must also adhere to the applicable data governance laws. 11. AI ethics 03:25 - 03:53 Aside from the legalities of enabling a use case, we should also stop to consider the ethics.

Performance improvements 00:12 - 00:43 As with all technological advancements, we expect better performance with time, but let's define what we mean by better performance. Generative AI models produce content, so it's natural to compare what they can produce with what people can. We expect that generative AI models will produce content that much more closely resembles human-generated content. We also expect generative AI models to tackle more complex instructions and questions with greater reliability. 4. What's driving the improvements? 00:43 - 01:12 So what will drive these improvements? Recall that ChatGPT, and other text-generating AI models, have a large language model at their heart. The LLM learns patterns and structure in language from being given a huge amount of text data to learn from, which we call training data. Algorithms then detect language patterns by looking at the frequency and order of words in the training data, and finally, the model is fine-tuned through iterative processes that involves rating the quality of responses. 5. What's driving the improvements? 01:12 - 01:24 The amount of available training data will continue to increase, so models should develop a deeper understanding of language, including complex language expressions, such as sarcasm and idioms. 6. What's driving the improvements? 01:24 - 01:41 Additionally, many generative AI models collect usage data, including user ratings of the generated content. This data allows developers to continue to fine-tune the model while it is live. Let's discuss a few hurdles related to these improvements. 7. Building balanced datasets 01:41 - 02:07 Although there will be more training data that models can learn from, a big challenge will be ensuring that the data is balanced and high quality. Due to the sheer quantity and unstructured nature of the training data, reducing bias before training the model is difficult. As generative AI begins to become an integral part of day-to-day life, more robust procedures to mitigate bias will need to be developed. 8.

Just as a skilled chef carefully selects and combines ingredients to create a delicious dish, prompt engineering involves carefully designing prompts that effectively guide the model toward producing desired outputs. 4. Why prompt engineering? 00:48 - 01:02 Prompt engineering is essential to producing good output because the quality of the answers we get depends heavily on the provided prompts, where high-quality prompts lead to high-quality answers, 5. Why prompt engineering? 01:02 - 01:07 and low-quality prompts lead to low-quality answers. 6. Course goals and prerequisites 01:07 - 01:33 In this course, we'll master prompt engineering principles and best practices for building AI systems that harness the capabilities of language models. We'll delve into various prompt types and some business applications and apply these skills using the OpenAI Python package. Familiarity with Python and the OpenAI API is expected, but this video will briefly recap. 7. Recap: OpenAI API 01:33 - 01:55 The OpenAI API allows interaction with OpenAI models. To use the API, we must obtain a key by logging in, visiting the API keys page, creating a new secret key, and copying it for future use. If we misplaced our old key, we must delete it and generate a new one. 8. Recap: chat completions endpoint 01:55 - 02:14 The API provides various endpoints, but the main one used for chatting is chat completions. This endpoint is perfect for single-turn tasks and interactive dialogs, making it ideal for conversational applications like virtual assistants and chatbots. 9. Recap: message roles 02:14 - 02:19 Every API message has one of the three roles: user, 10. Recap: message roles 02:19 - 02:21 assistant, 11. Recap: message roles 02:21 - 02:22 or system. 12. Recap: message roles 02:22 - 02:29 System messages provide instructions to guide the model's behavior throughout a conversation. 13. Recap: message roles 02:29 - 02:33 User messages are prompts from the user. 14. Recap: message roles 02:33 - 02:37 And assistant messages are the responses to user prompts. 15. Recap: control parameters 02:37 - 02:56 Recall that the API has helpful control parameters. One of these is temperature, a value between zero and two that controls the randomness of the answer. Two makes the answer highly random, and zero makes it deterministic. 16. Recap: control parameters 02:56 - 03:02 Another parameter is max_tokens, which controls the desired response length. 17. Recap: communicating with the OpenAI API 03:02 - 03:49 Suppose we want to ask, \\"What is prompt engineering?\\" via the API. To do so, we first set up the client by calling the OpenAI class and setting our api_key. Then, we call the chat-dot-completions-dot-create() function, specifying the model and the messages we want to send in the form of a list of dictionaries, each specifying the role and the content to send. For the control parameters, we set the temperature to zero to get deterministic answers, and we don't specify max_tokens to avoid limiting the output length. Finally, we print the response. We will use this code block a lot for API communication throughout the course. 18. Creating get_response() function 03:49 - 04:15 To avoid writing it every time, we wrap the code inside a function named get_response that takes a prompt as input and sends it to the API just as before. Instead of printing the response, the function returns it as output. Now, we can call this function with one line of code and save the returned value in a variable we can print. 19. Prompt improvement 04:15 - 04:41 Prompt improvement now becomes a matter of modifying the prompt we're giving to the function. For instance, we can modify our previous prompt to let the model explain prompt engineering in terms that a 5-year-old can understand. The new response is written using more basic vocabulary and compares prompt engineering to giving clear instructions to a friend. here is the transcript. prepare college notes from it.","completion":"# College Notes on Prompt Engineering and Its Application with OpenAI API Introduction to Prompt Engineering Prompt engineering is akin to crafting a recipe, where the precision in selecting and combining ingredients (prompts) dictates the quality of the meal (output).

Whether you're cleaning and curating a messy dataset, deploying a machine learning model, or creating a sleek data visualization, the code you write should be a helpful tool to quickly get you where you need to go - not something that leaves you waiting around. In this course, you'll learn how to write cleaner, faster, and more efficient Python code. We'll explore how to time and profile your code in order to find potential bottlenecks. Then, you'll practice eliminating these bottlenecks, and other bad design patterns, using Python's Standard Library, NumPy, and pandas. After completing this course, you'll have everything you need to start writing elegant and efficient Python code! But first, let's explore what is meant by efficient Python code. 3. Defining efficient 01:12 - 01:58 In the context of this course, efficient refers to code that satisfies two key concepts. First, efficient code is fast and has a small latency between execution and returning a result. Second, efficient code allocates resources skillfully and isn't subjected to unnecessary overhead. Although your definition of fast runtime and small memory usage may depend on the task at hand, the goal of writing efficient code is still to reduce both latency and overhead. For the remainder of this course, we'll be exploring how to write Python code that runs quickly and has little memory overhead. 4. Defining Pythonic 01:58 - 03:02 We've defined what is meant by efficient code, but it is also important to note that this course focuses on writing efficient code using Python. Python is a language that prides itself on code readability, and thus, it comes with its own set of idioms and best practices. Writing Python code the way it was intended is often referred to as Pythonic code. This means the code that you write follows the best practices and guiding principles of Python. Pythonic code tends to be less verbose and easier to interpret. Although Python supports code that doesn't follow its guiding principles, this type of code tends to run slower. As an example, look at the non-Pythonic code in this slide. Not only is this code more verbose than the Pythonic version, it takes longer to run. We'll take a closer look at why this is the case later on in the course, but for now, the main take away here is that Pythonic code is efficient code! 5. The Zen of Python by Tim Peters 03:02 - 03:37 In the previous slide, I discussed the importance of following Python's guiding principles and idioms. But what are these idioms you may ask?

Although these aren't exhaustive, they give us more than enough to start using Python out-of-the-box. Let's explore a few built-in components that help write efficient Python code. 2. The Python Standard Library 00:19 - 01:13 Built-in components are referred to as the Python Standard Library. This library comes with every Python installation and is commonly cited as one of Python's greatest strengths. Python has a number of built-in types. We'll be focusing on specific data structure types like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Python also comes with built-in functions that provide a variety of problem-solving features. Listed here are a few of the built-in functions we'll discuss and use in the course. It's worth noting that Python's built-ins have been optimized to work within the Python language itself. Therefore, we should default to using a built-in solution (if one exists) rather than developing our own. 3. Built-in function: range() 01:13 - 01:31 Let's explore some notable built-in functions; starting with range. This is a handy tool whenever we want to create a sequence of numbers. Suppose we wanted to create a list of integers from zero to ten. We could explicitly type out each integer, but that is not very efficient. 4. Built-in function: range() 01:31 - 02:05 Instead, let's use range to accomplish this task. We can provide range with a start and stop value to create this sequence. Or, we can provide just a stop value assuming that we want our sequence to start at zero. Notice that the stop value is exclusive, or up to but not including this value. Also note the range function returns a range object, which we can convert into a list and print. 5. Built-in function: range() 02:05 - 02:21 range can also accept a start, stop, and step value (in that order). In this block of code, we tell range to create a sequence of numbers starting at two, ending at ten, and incrementing by two. 6. Built-in function: enumerate() 02:21 - 02:49 Another useful built-in function is enumerate. enumerate creates an index item pair for each item in the object provided. For example, calling enumerate on the list letters produces a sequence of indexed values. Similar to range, enumerate returns an enumerate object, which can also be converted into a list and printed. 7. Built-in function: enumerate() 02:49 - 03:03 We can also specify the starting index of enumerate with the keyword argument start. Here, we tell enumerate to start the index at five by passing start equals five into the function call. 8. Built-in function: map() 03:03 - 03:29 The last notable built-in function we'll cover is map. map applies a function to each element in an object. Notice that map takes two arguments; first, the function you'd like to apply and second, the object you'd like to apply that function on. Here, we use map to apply the built-in function round to each element of the nums list. 9. Built-in function: map() 03:29 - 03:55 map can also be used with a lambda, or, an anonymous function. Notice here, that we can use map and a lambda expression to apply a function, which we've defined on the fly, to our original list nums. The map function provides a quick and clean way to apply a function to an object iteratively without writing a for loop. prepare notes from above transcript","completion":"# Notes on Building with Built-in Python Components Introduction to Python Built-ins Python's philosophy of \\"batteries included\\" means it comes packed with built-in components that allow developers to use Python effectively right out of the box.

The Python Standard Library - **Definition**: The Python Standard Library is a collection of modules available in every Python installation. - **Strengths**: Recognized as one of Python's greatest assets, providing robust built-in types like lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and a variety of functions for problem-solving. - **Best Practice**: Default to using a built-in solution, if available, before considering developing custom solutions. Key Built-in Functions 1. **range()**: - Purpose: Generates a sequence of numbers. - Usage: Can specify start and stop values (start is inclusive, stop is exclusive), or just a stop value (defaults start to zero). - Variations: Accepts a third parameter, step, for creating sequences with specific increments. 2. **enumerate()**: - Purpose: Associates an index with each item in a given iterable (e.g., list), producing index-item pairs. - Usage: Converts results to a list for visibility, and can specify a starting index using the \`start\` keyword. 3. **map()**: - Purpose: Applies a specified function to each item in an iterable. - Usage: Takes a function and an iterable object as arguments. It's effective for applying functions iteratively without a loop. - Flexibility: Can use with built-in functions or lambda expressions for on-the-fly function definitions. Practical Applications - **range()**: Efficient for creating lists of numbers without manually typing them out, useful for loops, and data generation. - **enumerate()**: Enhances readability and functionality in loops that require both item values and their indices. - **map()**: Offers a concise way to perform element-wise operations on iterables, simplifying code that might otherwise use complex loops. Conclusion Python's built-in functions like range, enumerate, and map are instrumental in developing concise, readable, and efficient code. By leveraging these built-ins, Python developers can perform common programming tasks more effectively, adhering to Pythonic principles that emphasize clean, readable, and efficient coding practices."},{"prompt":"The power of NumPy arrays 00:00 - 00:24 NumPy, or Numerical Python, is an invaluable Python package for Data Scientists. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python and provides a number of benefits for writing efficient code. In this lesson, we'll highlight one of the most important advantages of NumPy: the NumPy array. 2. NumPy array overview 00:24 - 00:39 NumPy arrays provide a fast and memory efficient alternative to Python lists. Typically, we import NumPy as np and use np dot array to create a NumPy array. 3. NumPy array homogeneity 00:39 - 01:46 NumPy arrays are homogeneous, which means that they must contain elements of the same type. We can see the type of each element using the dot dtype method. Suppose we created an array using a mixture of types. Here, we create the array nums_np_floats using the integers one and three and a float two point five. Can you spot the difference in the output? The integers now have a proceeding dot in the array. That's because NumPy converted the integers to floats to retain that array's homogeneous nature. Using dot dtype, we can verify that the elements in this array are floats. Homogeneity allows NumPy arrays to be more memory efficient and faster than Python lists. Requiring all elements be the same type eliminates the overhead needed for data type checking. 4. NumPy array broadcasting 01:46 - 02:13 When analyzing data, you'll often want to perform operations over entire collections of values quickly. Say, for example, you'd like to square each number within a list of numbers. It'd be nice if we could simply square the list, and get a list of squared values returned. Unfortunately, Python lists don't support these types of calculations. 5. NumPy array broadcasting 02:13 - 02:26 We could square the values using a list by writing a for loop or using a list comprehension. But neither of these approaches is the most efficient way of doing this. 6. NumPy array broadcasting 02:26 - 02:54 Here lies the second advantage of NumPy arrays - their broadcasting functionality. NumPy arrays vectorize operations, so they are performed on all elements of an object at once. This allows us to efficiently perform calculations over entire arrays. Notice that by squaring the array nums_np, all elements are squared at once. 7. NumPy array indexing 02:54 - 03:09 Another advantage of NumPy arrays is their indexing capabilities. When comparing basic indexing between a one-dimensional array and list, the capabilities are identical. 8. NumPy array indexing 03:09 - 04:01 When using two-dimensional arrays and lists, the advantages of arrays are clear. To return the second item of the first row in our two-dimensional object, the array syntax is square bracket, zero, comma, one, square bracket. The analogous list syntax is a bit more verbose as you have to surround both the zero and one with square brackets. To return the first column of values in our two-d object, the array syntax is square bracket, colon, comma, zero, square bracket. Lists don't support this type of syntax, so we must use a list comprehension to return columns. 9. NumPy array boolean indexing 04:01 - 04:24 NumPy arrays also have a special technique called boolean indexing. Suppose we wanted to gather only positive numbers from the sequence listed here. With an array, we can create a boolean mask using a simple inequality. Indexing the array is as simple as enclosing this inequality in square brackets. 10. NumPy array boolean indexing 04:24 - 04:41 To do this using a list, we need to write a for loop to filter the list or use a list comprehension. In either case, using a NumPy array to index is less verbose and has a faster runtime. prepare notes from above transcript","completion":"# Notes on The Power of NumPy Arrays Introduction to NumPy - NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. - It offers significant benefits for writing efficient code, with the NumPy array being one of its most important advantages.

This means operations are executed on all elements of an array simultaneously, enhancing computational efficiency. 4. **Advanced Indexing**: - NumPy arrays offer enhanced indexing capabilities compared to Python lists. - Multi-dimensional indexing and boolean indexing simplify data manipulation tasks. Practical Applications of NumPy Arrays 1. **Creating NumPy Arrays**: - Created using \`np.array\`, NumPy arrays can be initiated from Python lists. - Example: \`nums_np_floats = np.array([1, 3, 2.5])\` 2. **Data Type Conversion**: - When mixed types are provided, NumPy converts them to a common type to preserve homogeneity. - Example: Integers in a float array are converted to floats. 3. **Operation on Elements**: - Performing arithmetic operations like squaring can be directly applied to each element in a NumPy array, unlike lists which require looping or list comprehension. 4. **Indexing Techniques**: - Basic indexing for one-dimensional arrays is straightforward. - Multi-dimensional arrays benefit from simpler syntax in NumPy for accessing rows, columns, or elements, compared to more verbose list counterparts. 5. **Boolean Indexing**: - A powerful feature for sub-setting arrays based on conditions. Boolean masks can directly filter arrays, making it more concise and faster than filtering lists. Advantages Over Python Lists - While Python lists are versatile, they fall short in computational speed and memory efficiency when dealing with large datasets or complex numerical computations. - NumPy arrays bridge this gap, offering a suite of functionalities tailored for scientific computing that lists simply cannot match, particularly for multi-dimensional data and bulk operations. Conclusion NumPy arrays epitomize efficient numerical computing in Python. Their design for speed, coupled with capabilities like broadcasting, advanced indexing, and homogeneity, make them indispensable for data scientists seeking to write high-performance Python code."},{"prompt":"Examining runtime 00:00 - 00:12 In this lesson, we'll learn how to examine the runtime of our code. As mentioned in the previous chapter, runtime is an important consideration when thinking about efficiency. 2. Why should we time our code? 00:12 - 00:32 Comparing runtimes between two code bases, that effectively do the same thing, allows us to pick the code with the optimal performance. By gathering and analyzing runtimes, we can be sure to implement the code that is fastest and thus more efficient. 3. How can we time our code? 00:32 - 01:15 To compare runtimes, we need to be able to compute the runtime for a line or multiple lines of code. IPython comes with some handy built-in magic commands we can use to time our code. Magic commands are enhancements that have been added on top of the normal Python syntax. These commands are prefixed with the percentage sign. If you aren't familiar with magic commands, don't worry, take a moment to review the documentation using the provided link. We won't be using all the magic commands listed in the docs, but it's helpful to know what magic commands are at your disposal. 4. Using %timeit 01:15 - 01:40 Consider this example: we want to inspect the runtime for selecting 1,000 random numbers between zero and one using NumPy's random-dot-rand function. Using %timeit just requires adding the magic command before the line of code we want to analyze. That's it! One simple command to gather runtimes. Magic indeed! 5. %timeit output 01:40 - 01:47 One advantage to using %timeit is the fact that it provides an average of timing statistics. 6. %timeit output 01:47 - 01:54 Notice that the output provides a mean, and standard deviation, of time. 7. %timeit output 01:54 - 02:25 We also see that multiple runs and loops were generated. %timeit runs through the provided code multiple times to estimate the code's execution time. This provides a more accurate representation of the actual runtime rather than relying on just one iteration to calculate the runtime. The mean and standard deviation displayed in the output is a summary of the runtime considering each of the multiple runs. 8. Specifying number of runs/loops 02:25 - 03:10 The number of runs represents how many iterations you'd like to use to estimate the runtime. The number of loops represents how many times you'd like the code to be executed per run. We can specify the number of runs, using the -r flag, and the number of loops, using the -n flag. Here, we use -r2, to set the number of runs to two and -n10, to set the number of loops to ten. In this example, %timeit would execute our random number selection 20 times in order to estimate runtime (2 runs each with 10 executions). 9. Using %timeit in line magic mode 03:10 - 03:24 Another cool feature of %timeit is its ability to run on single or multiple lines of code. When using %timeit in line magic mode, or with a single line of code, one percentage sign is used. 10. Using %timeit in cell magic mode 03:24 - 03:35 Similarly, we can run %timeit in cell magic mode (or provide multiple lines of code) by using two percentage signs. 11. Saving output 03:35 - 03:41 We can save the output of %timeit into a variable using the -o flag. 12. Saving output 03:41 - 03:59 This allows us to dig deeper into the output and see things like the time for each run, the best time for all runs, and the worst time for all runs. Let's try using %timeit with some of Python's built-in data structures. 13. Comparing times 03:59 - 04:25 In a previous chapter, we mentioned some of Python's built-in data structures called lists, dictionaries, and tuples. Python allows us to create these data structures using either a formal name, like list, dict, and tuple spelled out, or a shorthand called literal syntax. 14. Comparing times 04:25 - 04:43 If we wanted to compare the runtime between creating a dictionary using the formal name and creating a dictionary using the literal syntax, we could save the output of the individual %timeit commands as shown here. Then, we could compare the two outputs. 15. Comparing times 04:43 - 05:02 For simplicity, let's look at just the output of both the %timeit commands to see which was faster. Here, we can see that using the literal syntax to create a dictionary is faster than using the formal name without writing code to do the analysis for us. 16. Off to the races! 05:02 - 05:13 Now that we've learned how to use %timeit, we can compare different coding approaches to select the most efficient one. It's off to the races! prepare notes from above transcript","completion":"# Notes on Timing Code Execution in Python Importance of Timing Code - Timing code helps identify the most efficient implementation among alternatives, ensuring the adoption of the fastest and most resource-efficient approach. How to Time Code in IPython - IPython provides built-in magic commands for timing code, denoted by a percentage sign. These commands are essential tools for performance analysis. Using \`%timeit\` - \`%timeit\` is a magic command used to time the execution of Python code, offering an easy and effective way to gather runtime statistics. - **Usage**: Prefixed with a percentage sign and placed before a line of code to analyze its execution time. - **Advantages**: It automatically handles multiple runs and loops to provide a reliable average execution time, along with timing statistics such as mean and standard deviation. Output of \`%timeit\` - Provides detailed timing statistics, including mean runtime and standard deviation, based on multiple executions. - The output indicates the code's execution was repeated through specified runs and loops to accurately estimate its performance. Customizing \`%timeit\` Usage - Flags like \`-r\` for runs and \`-n\` for loops allow customization of the timing process to suit specific needs. - For instance, \`-r2 -n10\` configures \`%timeit\` to perform two runs with ten executions each. Modes of \`%timeit\` Execution - **Line Magic Mode**: For single lines of code, using one percentage sign (\`%\`). - **Cell Magic Mode**: For multiple lines of code, using two percentage signs (\`%%\`). Saving \`%timeit\` Output - The \`-o\` flag enables saving the output of \`%timeit\` into a variable, allowing further analysis of the execution times, including identifying the best and worst timings. Application Example: Comparing Data Structure Creation Times - \`%timeit\` can compare the creation times of Python's built-in data structures, like lists, dictionaries, and tuples, using formal names or literal syntax. - Results indicate that literal syntax is generally faster than using formal names for creating data structures. Conclusion and Application - \`%timeit\` is a powerful tool for optimizing Python code by allowing developers to analyze and compare the runtime of different code snippets efficiently. - Understanding and utilizing \`%timeit\` enables selection of the most efficient coding practices, significantly benefiting code performance and resource utilization."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Despite his initial support from many sectors for his role in the transition from monarchy to republic, Yuan's rule is largely seen as a failure due to several reasons: 1. **Betrayal of the Republican Movement**: Yuan Shikai initially positioned himself as a supporter of the revolution that aimed to replace the Qing dynasty with a republic. However, once in power, he showed authoritarian tendencies and sought to consolidate his power at the expense of democratic principles. His betrayal of the republican movement disillusioned many of his initial supporters. 2. **Attempt to Restore Monarchy**: In 1915, Yuan Shikai attempted to declare himself Emperor of China, a move that led to widespread opposition and rebellion. This attempt to establish a new monarchy under his rule was seen as a significant betrayal of the republican ideals that had led to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. His monarchical ambitions directly undermined the foundational principles of the newly established Republic of China, leading to his loss of credibility and support. 3. **Divisive Policies and Political Repression**: Yuan's political strategy often involved playing different factions against each other, which, while initially successful in consolidating his power, eventually led to increased political instability. He also resorted to political repression, censoring the press, and using the military to silence his critics, which alienated many potential allies and increased opposition to his rule. 4. **Economic Mismanagement**: Yuan's administration faced significant financial challenges, including rampant inflation and a struggling economy. His government became heavily reliant on foreign loans, which further compromised China's sovereignty and economic stability. The financial strain on the government and the populace contributed to his declining support. 5. **Failure to Unify China**: Although Yuan Shikai was a dominant figure, he was unable to unify the country. His leadership period was marked by the fragmentation of power and the rise of local warlords, which led to the Warlord Era after his death. The lack of a strong centralized government allowed these warlords to gain power, leading to a period of regional conflicts and division that lasted for decades. 6. **Legacy of Instability**: Yuan Shikai's failure to establish a stable and unified republican government led to a legacy of political and military fragmentation in China. His rule is often considered a significant factor in the ensuing instability that plagued the country until the mid-20th century. The rifts and power struggles that followed his presidency and abortive monarchy exacerbated the conditions leading to the long period of civil unrest and warlordism in China. In summary, Yuan Shikai's failure stemmed from his authoritarian approach to governance, betrayal of the republican principles he initially supported, unsuccessful attempt to become emperor, and inability to address the economic and political challenges of his time, all of which contributed to a period of significant instability in China."},{"prompt":"Possible explanations for failures/mitigating circumstances?","completion":"While Yuan Shikai's tenure is broadly viewed as a period of failure marked by significant missteps and miscalculations, several mitigating circumstances and explanations offer context to his actions and the environment in which he operated. Understanding these factors can provide a more nuanced view of his leadership and the challenges he faced: 1. **Chaotic Historical Context**: Yuan Shikai’s rise to power occurred during a tumultuous period in Chinese history. The late Qing Dynasty was marked by internal decay, corruption, and inability to modernize effectively in the face of Western and Japanese imperial ambitions. Yuan operated in an environment where the central authority was weak, and foreign powers exerted significant influence and pressure on China. This context of upheaval and external intervention made governance particularly challenging. 2. **Pressure from Foreign Powers**: At the time, China was under significant pressure from foreign powers, including Western countries and Japan, each with its vested interests and concessions. Yuan Shikai had to navigate the treacherous waters of international diplomacy, where foreign governments often had considerable influence over China's internal affairs. The need to handle these foreign pressures while trying to maintain sovereignty and internal stability placed Yuan in a challenging position. 3. **Lack of Institutional Support**: The Republic of China, newly established after the fall of the Qing Dynasty, lacked strong institutions to support democratic governance. The armature of democracy—respect for the rule of law, a culture of political participation, established civil liberties—wasn’t firmly in place. Yuan's attempts to consolidate power can be partly seen as a response to this lack of a stable and supportive institutional framework, forcing him back into traditional modes of centralized power to maintain order and governance. 4. **Warlordism and Regionalism**: The fragmentation of power across China, with various regional warlords commanding personal armies, made unification under a central government an extremely daunting task. Yuan's efforts to centralize power can thus be understood as an attempt to counteract the centrifugal forces of warlordism and regionalism. However, the approach and methods he used alienated many, exacerbating the very problem he sought to solve. 5. **Ambition vs. Reality**: Yuan's personal ambition to restore a form of monarchy with himself at its head can be seen as a misplaced attempt to stabilize China under a strong, centralized authority, drawing on historical precedents of imperial rule. However, this ambition failed to account for the significant, widespread desire among the populace and intellectual elites for a genuine republic and democratic governance, leading to widespread opposition. 6. **Economic Constraints and Challenges**: The economic situation Yuan inherited was dire, with a depleted treasury, foreign debts, and the need for modernization. His reliance on foreign loans and the increasing financial pressures could be seen as desperate measures in desperate times, aiming to stabilize and develop the country's economy despite the high cost or dependence they entailed. 7. **Personal Health and Death**: Yuan Shikai's health deteriorated significantly towards the end of his reign, possibly affecting his judgment and capacity to govern effectively. His death shortly after stepping down from his ambitions of monarchy left a power vacuum and unresolved tensions, contributing to the continued instability and fragmentation of China. Understanding these factors helps to provide a more balanced perspective on Yuan Shikai's leadership. While by no means exonerating him from the consequences of his decisions, these considerations highlight the complexity of the environment in which he operated and the multifaceted challenges he faced in a rapidly changing China."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},I={class:"card-container"},z={key:0,class:"empty-state"},W=["disabled"],L={key:0},E={key:1};function N(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",I,[(a(!0),i(y,null,x(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",z,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
