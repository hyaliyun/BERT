It is fish. I don't like apples. I can climb trees. I can sing \\" Miao, miao\\". What am I? Can you guess? What is Mimi? A) A dog B) A bird C) A cat D) A tiger","completion":"Based on the given information, it is possible to determine which animal Mimi is by assessing each choice and comparing it to the characteristics provided. A) A dog: While it is true that dogs can have black and white fur and occasionally enjoy sitting in the sun, the other characteristics mentioned do not align as well with what we would typically expect from a dog. Dogs generally do not climb trees, and the \\"miao, miao\\" vocalization is more consistent with another animal on this list. B) A bird: Birds can indeed have black and white feathers and sing, but the specific \\"miao, miao\\" vocalization and the fact that Mimi enjoys eating fish do not match with typical bird behavior. Moreover, the ability to climb trees is not a common trait among birds; they usually fly or perch in trees instead. C) A cat: Cats are known to have black and white fur and enjoy lying in the sun. Additionally, the vocalization \\"miao, miao\\" is a phonetic representation of the sounds cats typically make, which is often written as \\"meow\\" in English. Cats are also skilled climbers and are known to enjoy eating fish. Furthermore, Mimi's dislike of apples aligns with the fact that cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they primarily consume animal-based protein rather than plant-based foods. D) A tiger: Though a tiger might share some attributes with Mimi, such as a preference for fish and the ability to climb trees, other details suggest that Mimi is not a tiger. For instance, tigers do not have black and white fur patterns, nor do they vocalize with a \\"miao, miao\\" sound. Based on this analysis, the most likely answer is: C) A cat Mimi's black and white fur, love for sitting in the sun, favorite food being fish, dislike for apples, tree-climbing abilities, and recognizable \\"miao, miao\\" vocalization are all classic characteristics of a cat, making Option C the most fitting choice."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices: - office - building - house - desk - phone booth The rationale to choose \\"house\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The \\"house\\" is the most appropriate and logical place to keep a personal telephone directory for several reasons, as opposed to the other options provided, such as the office, building, desk, or phone booth. 1. Accessibility: Storing your personal telephone directory in your house provides easy, quick access whenever you need to look up a contact or reference a phone number. This is particularly useful in case of emergencies or urgent calls when you need to get in touch with family members, friends, or essential services. 2. Privacy: Your personal telephone directory contains private information about your contacts, such as their full names, phone numbers, addresses, and potentially even birthdays or personal notes. Keeping this valuable information within your house offers a level of privacy and security that is not present in public or semi-public spaces such as an office or building. 3. Personalization: Your house is a space where you have the freedom to personalize and arrange items according to your preferences. This means that you can choose where to store your telephone directory within your home, whether it be in a specific drawer, on a shelf, or even next to your phone for maximum convenience. 4. Incongruence of other choices: The other options presented have distinct disadvantages: a. Office: Typically, an office is reserved for work-related activities and materials. Mixing personal items, such as a personal telephone directory, with work resources can lead to confusion, misplacement, and potential privacy concerns. b. Building: This choice is too vague and lacks specificity. A building could refer to various locations within a house, an office, or even a shared public space. Leaving a personal item like a telephone directory in such an indefinite location increases the risk of it being lost or accessed by unauthorized individuals. c. Desk: While a desk might be an acceptable place for a work-related telephone directory, keeping a personal telephone directory could lead to unnecessary clutter and disorganization. Additionally, if the desk is located in an office or shared workspace, it may pose privacy concerns or create confusion. d. Phone booth: With the widespread use of mobile phones and the decline of phone booths, this option is outdated and impractical. Furthermore, storing personal items in a public space like a phone booth presents significant risks related to privacy, theft, and loss. In conclusion, the most appropriate and secure option for keeping a personal telephone directory is within a house. This location ensures easy access, promotes privacy and personalization, and avoids the inconveniences and concerns that come with the other options provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The music video for \\"Single Ladies\\" was shot immediately after that of \\"If I Were a Boy\\", but it received less attention during production than the \\"higher-gloss, higher-profile video\\" for \\"If I Were a Boy\\". Both videos were shot in black-and-white in New York City and were directed by Jake Nava, with whom Beyoncé had worked on previous music videos including \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Beautiful Liar\\". \\"Single Ladies\\" was choreographed by Frank Gatson Jr. and JaQuel Knight, and incorporates J-Setting choreography. The two music videos premiered on MTV's Total Request Live show on October 13, 2008 to reinforce the concept of conflicting personalities. The videos were released to other media outlets on the same date and subsequently included on Beyoncé's remix album with videography, Above and Beyoncé, and the platinum edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce. Beyoncé told Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly that the inspiration for the video was a 1969 Bob Fosse routine entitled \\"Mexican Breakfast\\" seen on The Ed Sullivan Show, which featured Fosse's wife, Gwen Verdon, dancing with two other women. \\"Mexican Breakfast\\" had become an Internet viral sensation the previous summer after Unk's \\"Walk It Out\\" was dubbed over the original mix.

[The dancers] had a plain background and it was shot on the crane; it was 360 degrees, they could move around. And I said, 'This is genius.' We kept a lot of the Fosse choreography and added the down-south thing—it's called J-Setting, where one person does something and the next person follows. So it was a strange mixture ... It's like the most urban choreography, mixed with Fosse—very modern and very vintage.

Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules.

Construction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway began in 1845. The line was opened in October 1849, with services from Manchester London Road via Sale to Altrincham. In 1931 it became one of Great Britain's first electrified railway lines, with a 1,500 V DC overhead line. At the same time a new Altrincham station was opened on the same line, at Navigation Road, serving housing developments in the area. By 1937, 130 train services ran daily between Manchester and Altrincham. The line was renovated in the early 1990s to form part of the Manchester Metrolink light rail system. Broadheath railway station served the northern part of Altrincham between 1853 and 1962, on the line from Manchester, via Lymm to Warrington.Altrincham Interchange is one of the Metrolink's termini. The interchange was refurbished (2015–16), and now includes a brand new footbridge, with 3 lifts to cope with increased passenger demands, a larger scale ticket office, and modern bus interchange. The new Interchange is a modern design building that looks fantastic and is helping to regenerate Altrincham city centre as the new building has helped to transform the surrounding area. The Interchange connects the town to several locations in Greater Manchester, such as Sale and Bury. The service also includes Navigation Road station. Metrolink services leave around every six minutes, between 07:15 and 19:30 on weekdays, and less frequently at other times.

Lack of focus on the main topic: The reviewer expresses that the book, which is supposed to be about Bob Dylan, ends up focusing more on the religious aspects like \\"the sermon on the mount\\" rather than providing new information about the main subject. 2. Presence of bias: The review highlights that the book was written from a point of bias, which may lead to a skewed perspective on the topic. This might not provide a comprehensive or objective view of the subject matter of the book, and it can affect the overall experience of reading it. 3. Long and seemingly unnecessary quotes: The reviewer mentions that some reference Bible verses extend over a page, which may disrupt the flow of the text and contribute to a less engaging reading experience. It might also discourage readers who are interested in learning about Bob Dylan rather than delving into religious texts. 4. Publisher's influence: The fact that the book is published by a Christian publishing company (Relevant Books) could be a reason for the heavy religious content. This information could make potential readers doubtful whether they will get a balanced and well-researched account of Bob Dylan's life and work or if the religious angle might overshadow the main theme of the book.

Two arrested after policemen killed in US Police are searching for Curtis Banks and Marvin Banks in relation to the murder of two Mississippi officers. (AAP) Two brothers have been arrested over the killing of two police officers in Mississippi. Police officers Benjamin Deen, 34, and Liquori Tate, 25, were shot on Saturday and taken to hospital where they were confirmed dead, The Clarion-Ledger newspaper reported, citing Forrest County Coroner Butch Benedict. Officials did not give details on the motive of the attack but said the suspects, Curtis Banks, 26, and Marvin Banks, 29, were arrested early on Sunday, ending an hours-long manhunt, according to the newspaper. Both men were reported to have criminal records, which include drugs and weapons-related charges and felony convictions. A third woman who was allegedly in the car at the time of the shooting in Hattiesburg city was also taken into police custody. The killings come in the wake of another police shooting in New York, where plainclothes officer Brian Moore, 25, was shot in the head and died last Monday. A total of five police officers have been killed in the past five months in the United States, including two other New York policemen who were shot in December. Hattiesburg Mayor Johnny DuPree decried the latest killings. \\"The men and women who go out every day to protect us, the men and women who go out every day to make sure that we're safe, they were turned on tonight,\\" DuPree said, according to The Clarion-Ledger. The newspaper said one of the officers pulled a car over Saturday night, approached the vehicle, and was joined by a second officer before shots were fired. One of the suspects allegedly fled in a police vehicle, which was later found abandoned. A neighbouring police force in Oxford, Mississippi mourned the slain officers. \\"Both Hattiesburg Police Officers have died. Terrible.

Write a summary based on this article: PORT-AU-PRINCE—Even as faint cries continue to be detected beneath the rubble, the emphasis of relief teams is already shifting away from the trapped to confront a much broader humanitarian challenge: Helping the hundreds of thousands struggling for food and shelter across the city. View Full Image Reuters Victims reach for water Friday. Only 24 hours remain to save the trapped. The consensus among quake experts is that time is short to save the trapped. Still, there were some isolated successes. Rescuers Friday saved a woman who sang \\"Jesus will save me\\" just before medics cut off her leg to free her. But hundreds of thousands are homeless, tens of thousands are wounded, and nearly everyone lacks clean drinking water, raising the risk of a secondary wave of water-borne disease and death in coming days. On Saturday, relief groups and officials were focused on moving the food, water and other aid flowing into Haiti in earnest out of the clogged airport and to hungry, haggard earthquake survivors in the capital. In many neighborhoods, outside help hadn't yet arrived. At the corner of Rue St. Gerard and Route des Dalles, a law office has crumbled in ruin; on Friday a trapped woman could be heard moaning inside. The hillside across the street is a fresh, red-dirt grave for 32 victims. Neighbors dig through rubble searching for earthquake survivors at Carrefour Feuilles University, Haiti. WSJ's David Belle reports. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was expected in Port-au-Prince on Saturday, to confer with President Rene Preval and U.S. and international civilian and military officials on how best to help the recovery effort and Haitian government. Ms. Clinton on Friday cited a \`\`race against time'' before anxiety and anger create additional problems. Relief workers warned that unless supplies are quickly delivered, Port-au-Prince will degenerate into lawlessness. Separately, Mr. Preval on Saturday implored the international community to better coordinate the massive aid effort and not to squabble over how to provide it. A water delivery truck driver said he was attacked in one of the city's slums. There were reports of isolated looting as young men walked through downtown with machetes, and robbers reportedly shot one man whose body was left on the street. On Friday, U.S. military crews got the capital's airport working, and cargo planes delivered rescue supplies. But progress remained slow. The aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, for instance, floated five miles offshore, unable to find a place to unload supplies because of extensive damage to Haiti's main port. At the airport, a stream of flights arrived and departed without difficulty in the predawn hours for the first time since the quake. But members of the Air Force team, the 621st Contingency Response Wing, expressed frustration they hadn't been sent earlier to help the aid flow there, saying Thursday's flight freeze may have been avoided. \\"We would have liked to have been there a little bit sooner to unclog the airfield,\\" said Col. Brian O'Connor, the wing's commander. \\"It makes me cringe, it's so disorderly.\\" Haitians are getting increasingly desperate. There were scattered reports of looting and violence, reflecting the challenge of policing and governance amid such a broad crisis. Small, roving bands of young men with machetes raided several wrecked homes, the Associated Press reported. Senior U.S. officials said Washington is beginning to map out a reconstruction plan. The State Department's point person on Haiti, Cheryl Mills, stressed that Washington isn't drafting plans for some kind of U.S. interim administrator. The Red Cross estimates 45,000 to 50,000 people were killed in the earthquake. Other estimates are higher. Haiti's secretary of state for public safety, told Reuters that the death toll could hit 140,000. Among the living on Friday were people like Junior Lerolien. Three days after losing his entire family, he walked the streets in search of water. The 22-year-old tried to get in to the United Nations compound near the city's airport, but was turned back by guards. Mr. Lerolien was outside his house in the Delmas district Tuesday when he felt the shock. \\"I saw the house collapse,\\" he said. His mother, father, three brothers and sister were inside. The rubble was so deep, he didn't even try to dig them out. \\"My whole family is buried,\\" Mr. Lerolien said.

United Nations disaster experts said at least 10% of housing in the Haitian capital was destroyed, leaving about 300,000 homeless. The U.N. launched an appeal to raise 550 million to help survivors. Just a few kilometers from the intersection of Rue St. Gerard and Route del Dalles, the national soccer stadium has become a makeshift hospital. Several hundred people turned up looking for treatment. \\"No gloves, nothing to sew wounds, no antiseptic,\\" said Wadner Lima, a volunteer Haitian paramedic. Mr. Lima tended to a boy with a head wound and a man whose leg was badly burned. His medical kit, a small red tackle box, had been depleted. \\"We just have some gauze left.\\" Outside the stadium, refugees clamored to board buses out of the city. A dead body lay atop a mattress.Across Port-au-Prince, doctors and nurses provided medical attention in almost medieval conditions. Outside Haiti's national public-health laboratory, scores of wounded pleaded to get inside, where a squad of Belgian first-responders and Canadian military medics operated a field hospital. People carried injured relatives on makeshift gurneys. On the sidewalk outside the gates, a teenage girl lay near an old woman on a table with a crumpled umbrella shielding a bleeding knee. A young man, eyes wide with terror, was carried on a piece of plywood. His distended leg leaked pus. \\"Now it is emergency medicine, like war medicine—amputations, cleaning wounds, keeping people alive,\\" said Ronald Ackermans, a nurse and part of a team of 60 or so medics and search-and-rescue personnel who flew in from Brussels. One of the problems is what to do with the dead. Back on Rue St. Gerard in the Carrefour Feuille neighborhood, people rubbed limes on their nostrils to stymie the smell of death. The earthquake remade this neighborhood in a few, violent seconds. An art gallery is in ruins; so is a pharmacy. No one knows what became of the old lady who used to sell rice from a boiling pot on the corner. Clare Lydie Parent, who is mayor of the hillside town of Petionville, stood amidst the rubble in an official orange vest on Friday, helping direct rescue efforts at what had been the law offices—the building with a survivor in it. \\"I heard the voice this morning,\\" Ms. Parent said. \\"She gave me her name. She said, 'Mary.'\\" Next door, at the small Universite Ste. Gerard, there were no orange vests, just young men scooping and tugging with their bare hands. On Friday, residents heard voices and were convinced that several students remained alive in a basement classroom that had room for 60. \\"They are calling to us, 'We're here, please help us,'\\" said Frederic Sergefils, who believed his brother was among those inside. At one point, one of the rescuers used a chair seat to dig into the wreckage. Just down the street, a wide-eyed Marie Yolene, 22, looked at the wreckage of a four-room house she shared with her three sisters, aged 21, 18 and 15. The chairs and beds inside lay open to the street: The exterior walls had collapsed outward. Three of the four were in the house when the quake hit. The fourth, Marie, had been at the city's Sacred Heart Cathedral—which collapsed, killing many. Yet all four survived. \\"I was so lucky,\\" Marie said. —Jose de Cordoba and Charles Forelle contributed to this report. Write to Dionne Searcey at dionne.searcey@wsj.com ||||| PORT-AU-PRINCE | PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Saturday declared one of the largest relief efforts in U.S. history to help Haiti's earthquake victims as survivors begged for aid still only trickling through to them and looters fought in the streets. Four days after a massive quake killed up to 200,000 people and wrecked most of the capital Port-au-Prince, hundreds of thousands of Haitians were still desperately waiting for assistance as scavengers and looters preyed on shattered buildings in the widespread absence of authority and order. Even as aid poured into Port-au-Prince airport on Saturday, thousands of Haitians streamed out on foot with suitcases on their heads or jammed in cars to find food, water and shelter in the countryside and flee aftershocks as well as violence. Logistical logjams still kept major relief from reaching most victims, many of them sheltering in makeshift camps on streets strewn with debris and decomposing bodies. On the city's shattered main commercial boulevard near the port, hundreds of scavengers and looters swarmed over the wrecks of shops, carrying off anything they could find and occasionally fighting among themselves for a prized item. They carried stones, knives, ice-picks and hammers, as much to defend themselves as to break into wrecked premises and slash open boxes to grab T-shirts, bags, toys and other items. Obama promised help as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton flew to Haiti where the shell-shocked government gave the United States control over its main airport to guide aid flights from around the world. With the government saying up to 200,000 people may have been killed, the quake could be one of the ten deadliest in history. \\"We're moving forward with one of the largest relief efforts in our history to save lives and deliver relief that averts an even larger catastrophe,\\" Obama said on Saturday, flanked by his predecessors George W. Bush and Bill Clinton who will lead a charity drive to help Haiti. But on the streets of the city, where scarce police patrols fired occasional shots and tear gas to try to disperse looters, the distribution of aid appeared random, chaotic and minimal. Downtown, young men could be seen carrying pistols. As international rescue crews combed rubble for survivors across the capital, there were jostling scrums for food and water as U.S. helicopters swooped down to throw out boxes of water bottles and rations. A reporter also saw foreign aid workers tossing packets of food to desperate Haitians. DISORGANIZED DISTRIBUTION \\"The distribution is totally disorganized. They are not identifying the people who need the water. The sick and the old have no chance,\\" said Estime Pierre Deny, standing at the back of a crowd looking for water with his empty plastic container. Watching the looters downtown, student Ricardo Fume said: \\"People have nothing to eat, so they steal these things to sell. The United States had the World Trade Center (the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks), we had this, it is worse,\\" Fume said. Haiti is the Western Hemisphere's poorest country and has for decades struggled with devastating storms, floods and political unrest. Around 9,000 U.N. peacekeepers have provided security here since a 2004 uprising ousted one president. |||||","completion":"In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, relief efforts are shifting focus from rescuing trapped individuals to addressing the broader humanitarian issues affecting the city. With hundreds of thousands left homeless, clean drinking water scarce, and the risk of disease increasing, the challenge now becomes providing food, water, and shelter to these survivors. Although aid is flowing into the nation, the damaged infrastructure makes efficient distribution a challenge. The situation is further complicated by increasing desperation and potential lawlessness, as frustration and anger build among the survivors. This crisis highlights the challenges of providing assistance in the midst of widespread destruction and emphasizes the need for efficient coordination and rapid response."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Air enters bronchial tubes - Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung - Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs - Alveoli is surrounded by many small blood vessels - Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels - Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body - Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale. Answer:","completion":"The first step missing in this process is \\"inhaling air through the nostrils or mouth.\\" To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the process, let's start with the missing first step and then proceed through the rest of the steps in detail: 1. Inhaling air through the nostrils or mouth: The process of respiration begins when an individual breathes in air through their nostrils or their mouth. The nostrils are lined with hair and mucus, acting as natural filters that capture dust, allergens, and pathogens, preventing them from entering the respiratory system. The air is also warmed and humidified as it passes through the nasal cavity. 2. Air travels down the trachea: After the air is inhaled through the nostrils or mouth, it travels down the trachea, also known as the windpipe. The trachea is a tube-like structure that is surrounded by cartilage rings that provide it with support and flexibility. 3. Air enters bronchial tubes: The trachea branches into two bronchial tubes, which transport the air into the lungs. Each bronchial tube is lined with cilia and mucus to help filter the air and prevent any harmful particles from entering the lungs. 4. Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung: Within the lungs, the bronchial tubes further branch into smaller structures called bronchioles, which divide and narrow progressively, forming an extensive network throughout the lung tissue. 5. Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs: At the end of the bronchioles, there are tiny air sacs called alveoli. The walls of the alveoli are very thin, and their primary function is to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. 6. Alveoli are surrounded by many small blood vessels (capillaries): The alveoli have a rich supply of blood, allowing for a thorough exchange of gases between the alveoli and the blood vessels. 7. Oxygen passes through the alveoli into blood vessels: As oxygen from the inhaled air enters the alveoli, it diffuses through the alveolar walls and into the surrounding capillaries. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide in the blood diffuses from the capillaries into the alveoli. 8. Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body: The oxygen-rich blood leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins and is pumped by the heart throughout the body. The blood delivers the oxygen to the body's cells and tissues, where it is used for cellular respiration and various metabolic processes. 9. Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs: After the oxygen has been utilized by the body's cells, waste, in the form of carbon dioxide, is produced. The blood then carries this carbon dioxide waste back to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries and into the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. 10. Carbon dioxide is released when you exhale: Finally, the carbon dioxide that has been transported back to the lungs is expelled from the body during exhalation. As the muscle diaphragm relaxes, it pushes air out of the lungs, allowing the carbon dioxide to exit through the nostrils or mouth. This entire process constitutes the respiratory cycle, which is essential for providing the body with the necessary oxygen and removing waste products in the form of carbon dioxide."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After her latest project is undervalued she faces professional setbacks including clients losing confidence in her work. To bounce back she is hired to handle the IPO for Cachet, a privacy company with a social networking platform. Around the same time Naomi bumps into Samantha Ryan, an old college classmate who now works as a public attorney. Unbeknownst to Naomi, Samantha is investigating Naomi's on-again, off-again boyfriend Michael Connor, a broker at the same firm as Naomi who Samantha suspects is involved in insider trading. Michael tries to get information from Naomi about Cachet but fails. While doing due diligence, Naomi learns from Marin, one of the coders, that Cachet is hackable. Despite having a nagging feeling that something is wrong, the numbers check out and Naomi continues to try to sell the shares of the company to investors. Michael, who has had no new insider trading tips to pass on to his friends at investment firm Titanite, tries unsuccessfully to hack into Naomi's phone. Vice President Erin Manning, Naomi's assistant on the IPO, learns that Marin has been fired.

In a recent State of the Union address focused on gun control, not only did we witness the president shedding tears, but the audience rose to its feet as well. The question that arises is, what brought about this transformation in the man who was known for keeping his emotions in check? According to the President's biographer, the emergence of this sensitivity is due to a newfound sense of freedom. It seems that after four years in office, Obama has grown more comfortable being himself and allowing his emotions to show.

Given the question: Michael Morzeny put his hands into the pockets of his overcoat and hugged the fabric tighter around his body. The winter wind hurried down Columbus Avenue and the hem of his coat flapped around his knees letting little pockets of cold waft up to invade the warmth his body had spent so much time preparing and storing around his torso. With a bitter squeeze of his hands, his knuckles now getting cold, Morzeny bowed his square shoulders to the wind and continued walking. At sixty-seven years old the New York winters bothered Morzeny more than he cared to admit. And, although no doctor would admit it to him, he was positive that the first faint hints of arthritis tweaking through his hands were made worse by the cold. At every cross street the setting sun flashed through to the avenue in shades of crisp pink and red. Morzeny didn't want to be working right now. But these outings were the price he paid for having a hybrid job, owning buildings and brokering as many of his own leases as possible. When he had first come to the city he had been told that he needed a job, not for income, his providers took care of that, but for his own sanity. Something to keep him going. He had asked for something in real estate and had never bothered to wonder what other paths he might have taken. He had always been able to focus to the point of blindness. It helped him in every aspect of his work. He arrived at the brownstone building housing the apartment he was to show tonight. His building was tucked into a short row of buildings that squatted over the street, their steps reaching towards the curb like stunted growths.

Question: If somebody wanted to start a garden they would put seeds in the ground, then watering them would be making grow what? A. growth B. harvesting C. die D. sad E. plants The best answer is Answer:","completion":"E. plants When someone starts a garden, they typically begin by planting seeds in the ground. These seeds contain the necessary genetic information and stored energy for a new plant to grow. After planting the seeds, watering them is essential to provide the moisture needed for germination and growth. When the seeds are watered, they absorb the water, which allows them to swell and eventually sprout. The water also supports essential biological processes within the seed, such as the activation of specific enzymes and the breaking down of stored energy supplies. As the seed absorbs water, the developing embryo inside starts to grow and eventually bursts through the seed coat. This growth allows the seedling to develop roots, stems, and foliage, which are the foundational components of plants. Given enough time, water, sunlight, and the right environmental conditions, the seeds will grow into plants that can produce flowers, fruit, or even new seeds to perpetuate the life cycle of the plant's species. Watering the seeds is a crucial step in the process, as it not only triggers germination but also supports the overall growth and health of the developing plants. In summary, the best answer to the question is option E, as watering seeds after planting them in the ground ultimately leads to the growth and development of plants.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Salt water is contained in a factory or plant - The water is boiled to a very high tempature - The salt becomes seperated from the water - The salt is removed - The water is able to be drank at this point. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose desalination is quicker happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"In order to comprehensively address the given perturbation hypothesis, it is crucial to first understand the desalination process. The steps provided are a simplified description of the process, and in practice, desalination plants employ a variety of techniques to remove salt and other impurities from seawater to make it potable. Two of the most common techniques are thermal desalination (e.g., multi-stage flash distillation and multi-effect distillation) and membrane desalination (e.g., reverse osmosis). Now, let us consider the hypothesis: if desalination happens more quickly, will more salt be removed from the water? To answer this question, it is essential to analyze the direct and indirect effects of such a perturbation on the desalination process. Direct effects: 1. Efficiency: If the desalination process is accelerated, the efficiency of salt removal might be affected. In the case of thermal desalination, the rate at which the water is heated and evaporated will be increased. However, if the process is too rapid, there may not be enough time for the salt to separate from the water, resulting in reduced salt removal efficiency. 2. Equipment stability: Desalination equipment is designed to operate within specific parameters for optimal performance. A rapid increase in the desalination rate may put undue stress on the equipment, leading to potential malfunctions and decreased effectiveness of the salt removal process. Indirect effects: 1. Energy consumption: A quicker desalination rate could lead to higher energy consumption. In thermal desalination, the energy required to heat and evaporate water quickly would be greater than in the standard process. Similarly, in membrane desalination, the increased pressure required to force water through the membrane more quickly would consume more power. This could result in higher operational costs and greater environmental impacts. 2. Water quality: The water resulting from a rapid desalination process may be of lower quality due to reduced salt removal efficiency. The water could still contain significant concentrations of various salts and impurities, making it unsuitable for potable use without further treatment. Such an effect may lead to the need for additional post-treatment processes, increasing the overall cost and complexity of the desalination process. 3. Environmental impact: A faster desalination process could exacerbate existing environmental issues associated with desalination, such as brine disposal and greenhouse gas emissions. The increased rate of salt removal may lead to a higher volume of brine generated, which if not handled properly, can have negative environmental impacts on marine ecosystems and groundwater. Additionally, the higher energy consumption related to quicker desalination rates could contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. In conclusion, while a quicker desalination process may appear to be beneficial in terms of providing potable water more rapidly, it may in fact have various direct and indirect adverse effects on the process itself, water quality, and the environment. Consequently, the supposed perturbation could negatively affect the overall efficiency and practicality of the desalination process. Instead, it is crucial to focus on optimizing existing processes and developing new technologies that can remove salt and impurities from water effectively while minimizing negative impacts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is a man of about sixty-five, with gray hair and a friendly face. He gave up his work a short while ago and is now traveling round the world before he retires to some quite country village. As a young man, he served for many years as a doctor in the army and visited many countries. He's told us a great deal about the city to which they are going. Then there is \\"Grandmother\\". I call her that because her name escapes me. In spite of being a grandmother, she looks remarkable young, no more than fifty. She is on her way to visit a daughter who went to Australia some years ago. Naturally she is very excited at the thought of seeing her again, and her three grandchildren, whom she has never seen. Then there is a man I don't care for very much, the engineer by the name of Barlow. He has been _ in England and is now returning to his work in Singapore. The other person who sits at our table is Mrs. Hunt. I've found out hardly anything about her. She's extremely quiet and rarely talks, except to consult the doctor about children's various illnesses. She is on her way to join her husband in India. Question: What can we know about Mr. Stone? - He is a doctor in the army now. - He is going to give up his work. - He has been retired for many years. - He knows a lot about the city the author is going to visit.

You may recall that I’d been helping out a local charity with their website? Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed - Answer:","completion":"The missing first step of the process is: 1. An organism dies and its remains are quickly buried by sediment (such as mud, sand, or silt) in a specific environment (e.g., a riverbed, lake, ocean floor, or terrestrial ecosystem). This rapid burial helps to protect the remains from scavengers and decomposition, preserving the original structure. Here's a detailed outline of the entire process with the missing step included: 1. An organism dies and its remains are quickly buried by sediment. 2. Over time, sediment builds up over the remains, providing additional protection from the elements and scavengers. 3. As the remains decompose, only trace amounts of the original organic material are left behind, while the majority of the hard parts (such as bones, teeth, and shells) remain. 4. Over thousands to millions of years, the remaining organic parts are gradually replaced with minerals from the surrounding sediments and groundwater. This process, known as permineralization or petrification, involves the precipitation of minerals into the pores of the original structures, effectively turning them into stone. 5. Eventually, a fossil is formed, representing the preserved remains or impressions of the original organism. These fossils can be discovered through erosion, excavation, or other geological events that expose the layers of sediment where the fossils are buried."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The latter condemned his strong support for Algerian independence, and the UK's Eden government was agitated by Nasser's campaign against the Baghdad Pact. In addition, Nasser's adherence to neutralism regarding the Cold War, recognition of communist China, and arms deal with the Eastern bloc alienated the United States.

Unable to dislodge the food, Julia attempts to save her by performing a tracheotomy which results in the child's bleeding to death. Julia leaves her husband Magnus (Keir Dullea) and moves to a new house with an upstairs room containing a child's possessions, including a mechanical clown toy with sharp cymbals on which she cuts her finger. In the park, Julia sees a young girl that she believes is Kate but the child disappears. Unusual things happen to take place in the house such as strange noises and appliances turning on by themselves. Later, Julia again sees the girl in the park and finds a mutilated turtle and knife where she stood. Julia lets Magnus' sister Lily use her house to conduct a seance.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Mr Comey told a Senate committee they were wrong to denigrate the agency and its leadership. He was also \\"confused\\" by the \\"shifting explanations\\" for his sacking, which came as he led a probe into any links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. President Donald Trump later said he never sought to impede the inquiry. Mr Trump's attorney, Marc Kasowitz, said in a statement Mr Comey's testimony \\"finally confirmed publicly\\" that the president was not under investigation as part of any probe in Russian political meddling. In the statement, Mr Trump also denied asking Mr Comey for his loyalty or to drop an investigation into fired national security adviser Michael Flynn during private meetings. In his testimony, Mr Comey said Mr Trump had repeatedly told him he was doing a \\"great\\" job. He also suggested he was fired to \\"change the way the Russia investigation was being conducted\\". The former FBI boss remained largely composed throughout almost three hours of testimony but became impassioned when delivering his opening remarks. He told the panel that the White House \\"chose to defame me, and more importantly the FBI\\" by claiming the agency was \\"poorly led\\". \\"Those were lies, plain and simple. And I'm so sorry that the FBI workforce had to hear them,\\" he continued. \\"The FBI is honest. The FBI is strong. And the FBI is and always will be independent,\\" he said in his opening remarks. Mr Comey was leading one of several Russia investigations before Mr Trump fired him. US intelligence agencies believe Russia interfered in the US election and they are investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But there is no known evidence of collusion and President Donald Trump has dismissed the story as \\"fake news\\". His spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Thursday hit back at Mr Comey, saying: \\"I can definitively say the president is not a liar.\\" For Donald Trump the good news from James Comey's testimony is that the former FBI director clearly said the president was not directly under FBI investigation at the time he was fired. The bad news was, well, everything else. On multiple occasions, Mr Comey said he was either concerned or knew that the president or his administration was lying \\"plain and simple\\" - about the circumstances of his dismissal and about the nature of his meetings with the president. It's clear the president woefully mishandled this, for which he has paid a high price ever since. By unceremoniously sacking him, and offering a muddle of explanations for it, he created an adversary with both the means and the motivation to respond in the most damaging way. Mr Comey had a friend leak disturbing information about the president's actions to the media. He was given the biggest spotlight in a generation to publicly air further details. He stood before a Senate committee not just to defend himself, but also the honour of the FBI. The White House may claim today's testimony is a technical exoneration. Politically, however, it's a staggering blow. And when it comes to the presidency, politics is everything. During Thursday's testimony, Mr Comey emphasised that Russia's political meddling was \\"not a close call\\", adding: \\"There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever.\\" When asked by the Senate Intelligence Committee whether the president tried to stop the Russia investigation, Mr Comey said: \\"Not to my understanding, no.\\" He said he it was not for him to say whether Mr Trump's actions were an obstruction of justice. Democratic Senator Mark Warner, the committee's vice chairman, pressed Mr Comey on why he decided to keep a record of his conversations with Mr Trump. \\"I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting\\" he said. Mr Comey, who published his prepared remarks a day before the hearing, detailed one meeting with Mr Trump in which the president asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions and White House aide Jared Kushner to leave the Oval Office. \\"I knew something was about to happen that I needed to pay very close attention to,\\" he said. \\"I remember thinking that that was a very disturbing development.\\" During another meeting with Mr Trump, Mr Comey said the president appealed to him to \\"let go\\" an investigation into fired national security adviser Michael Flynn and his ties to the Kremlin. After US media reported the conversation, the president warned Mr Comey in a tweet, saying he \\"better hope there are no 'tapes' of our conversations\\". Mr Comey told the committee he hoped there were tapes, calling on Mr Trump to release them. \\"The president surely knows whether he taped me, and if he did my feelings aren't hurt. Release all the tapes, I'm good with it,\\" he said. The White House has refused to say whether any such tapes exist. After Mr Trump's tweet about potential tapes, Mr Comey said he realised it was important to release his own account of the story. He revealed that he asked a \\"good friend of mine\\" who is a professor at Columbia Law School to share contents of the memo with a reporter, in order to build pressure for a special counsel. As a result of this episode, former FBI chief Robert Mueller was appointed as special counsel to lead an independent investigation into the Trump campaign's potential ties to the Kremlin. Mr Comey said he was \\"sure\\" Mr Mueller was also looking at whether Mr Trump obstructed justice. Mr Trump attacked Mr Comey for leaking the documents, saying it showed that members of the US government are \\"actively attempting to undermine this administration\\". \\"He's new in government, and so therefore I think he's learning as he goes,\\" said Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. \\"I'm not saying it's an acceptable excuse. It's just my observation.\\" \\"If you want to convict the president of being inappropriate, putting Comey in a bad spot, being rude, crude and a bull in a china shop, you would win,\\" Senator Lindsey Graham told the BBC. \\"The American people elected a bull in a china shop to help them with their lives, not this.\\" Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said \\"it's hard to overstate the impact of Jim Comey's testimony today\\" and that \\"it seems like the walls are closing in\\". This article was about:","completion":"In simple words, Mr. Comey is a man who used to work for the FBI, which is an important group of people who help keep the country safe.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession -- one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom .","completion":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession -- one that typifies the delirium of post, pre, and extant stardom\\" can be perceived as moderately negative. To determine this, we must consider several factors: the choice of words, context, and overall expression of the sentence. Firstly, the sentence emphasizes a 'surface-obsession' that implies a focus on superficial and shallow aspects of the lifestyle it describes, rather than appreciating or delving into the deeper aspects. This negative connotation projects the idea that people are more interested in outward appearances, and thus could be judged or criticized for their lack of substance. Secondly, the word 'delirium' has a negative connotation, as it suggests confusion, disorientation, or even madness. In this context, it is used to describe the state of mind of those experiencing stardom, whether it is in the past, present, or future. This implies that stardom brings chaos and a lack of clarity, reinforcing the negative sentiment of the sentence. Moreover, the term 'deliberative account' suggests that the sentence aims to offer a critical examination or analysis of the described lifestyle. This further strengthens the negative implications, as it implies that the topic itself warrants a close evaluation and dissection due to its controversial or negative nature. However, it should be noted that the negative sentiment is not extremely harsh or severe; instead, it appears to gently criticize the superficiality and the chaotic nature that surrounds stardom. It is possible that the sentence aims to provoke thought and reflection in the reader's mind, encouraging them to critically analyze such a lifestyle and its implications. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence is moderately negative, as it emphasizes the shallow-focused lifestyle and associated delirium of stardom, prompting a critical reflection on the subject. The sentence uses negative keywords and expressions to portray this message, resulting in an overall negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Step 1: Isolate the term with g. We'll start by isolating the term that contains g, which is 270g. To do this, we'll eliminate the constant term -119698 by adding its opposite to both sides of the equation: 270g - 119698 + 119698 = -116188 + 119698 This simplifies to: 270g = 3510 Step 2: Solve for g by dividing both sides by 270.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: With the possible exception of equal rights, perhaps the most heated argument across the United States today is the death penalty . Many argue that it is an effective deterrent to murder , while others think there is no enough proof that the death penalty reduces the number of murders. The argument advanced by those who are against the death penalty is that it is cruel and inhuman punishment, that it is a mark of a bad society and finally that it is of questionable effectiveness as a deterrent to crime anyway. In our opinion, the death penalty is a necessary action. Throughout recorded history there have always been those peculiar persons in every society who made terrible crimes such as murder. But some are more dangerous than others. For example, it is one thing to take the life of another in time of blind anger, but quite another to coldly plan and carry out the murder of one or more people in the style of a butcher. Thus, murder, like all other crimes, is a matter of different degree. While it could be argued with some reason that the criminal in the first instance should be merely kept from society, such should not be the fate of the latter type murderer. The value of the death penalty as a deterrent to crime may be open to discussion. But the majority of people believe that the death penalty protects them. Their belief is proved by the fact that the death penalty prevents murder. For example, from 1954 to 1963, when the death penalty was carried out from time to time in California, the murder rate remained between three and four murders for each 100, 000 population. Since 1964 the death penalty has been done only once, and the murder rate has risen to10.4 murders for each 100, 000 population. The sharp climb in the state's murder rate, which began when killings stopped, does not happen by chance. It certainly shows that the death penalty does stop many murderers. If the law about death penalty is vetoed , some people will be murdered----some whose lives may have been saved if the death penalty... It can be inferred that the writer thinks that _ . A) the death penalty is the most important problem in the United States today B) the second type of murderers (in Paragraph 2) should be sentenced to death C) the veto of the law about death penalty is of little importance D) the value of the death penalty as a deterrent to crime is not to be discussed A:","completion":"The writer thinks that B) the second type of murderers (in Paragraph 2) should be sentenced to death. In their opinion, the death penalty is a necessary action for specific types of murderers, particularly those who coldly plan and carry out the murder of one or more people. The writer acknowledges that the death penalty's effectiveness as a deterrent to crime is open for discussion, but strongly believes that it does protect society and cites the rise in California's murder rate when executions stopped as evidence of its deterrent effect. Therefore, the writer advocates for the death penalty for certain types of murderers, implying that they support the idea that the second type of murderers should be sentenced to death."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This means that we need to start from the kth position in the list, and then move i positions forward each time. We will extract the elements from A and display them in a result list. The process stops when we reach an index that exceeds the length of the list. Algorithm: 1. Create an empty list called result. 2. Initialize a variable, currentIndex, as k-1. (k-1 because list index starts from 0) 3. Use a loop and perform the following steps: a. Check if currentIndex is within the range of A. b. If yes, then add the element at currentIndex of A to the result list. c. Increment the value of currentIndex by i. d. If currentIndex exceeds the length of A, break the loop. 4. Return the result list. Applying the algorithm: 1. result = [] 2. currentIndex = 3 - 1 = 2 3.

Would a linguist find the following sentence to be a valid English sentence grammatically? In the woods lives an old woman.","completion":"A linguist would indeed find the sentence \\"In the woods lives an old woman\\" to be a valid English sentence grammatically. Though the sentence structure may appear uncommon or even strange to some English speakers, it is still grammatically correct and conforms to the rules of English syntax. This particular sentence utilizes an inverted sentence structure, an intentional alteration of the standard subject-verb-object order often employed for stylistic purposes or to create emphasis. To better understand this sentence, let's analyze its grammatical components: 1. Subject: The subject of this sentence is \\"an old woman.\\" It represents the person or thing performing the action. 2. Verb: The verb in this sentence is \\"lives,\\" which denotes the action that the subject is performing or the state that the subject is in. 3. Prepositional phrase: \\"In the woods\\" is a prepositional phrase functioning as an adverb modifying the verb \\"lives.\\" It provides information about where the action of living is taking place. In English, the standard sentence structure follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) order, and in this case, the sentence would read, \\"An old woman lives in the woods.\\" This is a simple and straightforward sentence; however, the original sentence, \\"In the woods lives an old woman,\\" employs an inversion of this typical word order. Inverted sentences typically follow the pattern of adverbial (or adverbial phrase) + verb + subject. These inversions are utilized to emphasize a specific element in the sentence, create a rhythmic effect, or establish a more poetic tone. In the provided example, inverting the sentence order emphasizes the setting (\\"In the woods\\") and evokes a mysterious or mystical atmosphere surrounding the old woman's existence. From a linguistic standpoint, the sentence \\"In the woods lives an old woman\\" is grammatically valid and conforms to the rules of English syntax. Although it deviates from the conventional subject-verb-object order, the sentence demonstrates a deliberate and acceptable inversion of sentence structure for stylistic purposes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Getty Spending days ringside to other people’s parents bickering and arguing and general dysfunction takes a soul strong of stomach and long on patience, which is why only a hardy few to be a family court judge. But it doesn’t mean they’re not funny. Either that, or one Canadian justice found an unusual way to vent. Sick of the shenanigans of a couple from, ironically, the honeymoon capital of Niagara, he ruled that the wife should have full custody of their 13-year-old daughter but that the father should only pay 1 (and that’s a Canadian dollar) a month in child support. But it was the way he ruled that has everyone talking. Ontario Superior Court Judge Joseph Quinn’s 31-page December decision—which made the local papers and is still doing the rounds of legal circles on the internet—is filled with the kind of black humor and derision one would imagine is usually kept for close be-robed colleagues only. He chided the couple for “marinating in a mutual hatred so intense as to surely amount to a personality disorder,” and said the chances of amicable resolution were “laughable.” The wife had poisoned their daughter “irreparably” against the father who, the judge admitted, had “a near-empty parenting tool box.” (More on TIME.com: 5 New Reasons to Get or Stay Married This Year) Quinn mocked the couple’s habit of sending abusive, vulgarity-laced texts to each other and their inability to be civil at their children’s sporting events. On one occasion apparently, Catherine, the wife, had tried to run Larry over with her car — “always a telltale sign that a husband and wife are drifting apart,” the judge noted. Catherine’s relatives, several of whom are Hell’s Angels, made death threats against her ex , which the judge mentioned, adding that “on Oct. 18, 2007, a nautical theme was added. According to Larry, ‘Catherine’s sister-in-law yelled out her window that I was going to be floating in the canal dead.’ ” That Catherine told her children they’d go to jail if they even called their dad did not help matters. Larry, meanwhile, was given to flipping the bird every time he drove past his ex-wife’s house, leading the justice to observe that “a finger is worth a thousand words and therefore, is particularly useful should one have a vocabulary of less than a thousand words.” (More on TIME.com: Why Married Men Are Less Antisocial) Quinn knew his tone was harsh but defended it saying since the parties were “immune to reason” he had used ridicule as a last resort.

More on TIME.com: Healthland’s Guide to Life 2011 5 Little-Known Truths About American Sex Lives Can an iPhone App Save Your Marriage? ||||| Faced with warring ex-spouses besieging one another with threats and verbal abuse and dragging their children into it too, Ontario Superior Judge Joseph Quinn resorted to the only tool he had left - a highly unusual verbal roasting. \\"Paging Dr. Freud, paging Dr. Freud,\\" Judge Quinn began a recent judgment that has gone viral in the family-law community. \\"Here, a husband and wife have been marinating in a mutual hatred so intense as to surely amount to a personality disorder requiring treatment. The source of difficulties is hatred: a hardened, harmful, high-octane hatred.\\" Judge Quinn's 31-page decision boils over with the frustrations of a family-law judge who is called upon time and again to referee bouts between couples who were once in love. He even takes a shot at family law itself, saying that spousal support is \\"the roulette of family law - blindfolds, darts and Ouija boards being optional.\\" And he anticipates criticism of his tone: \\"The parties repeatedly have shown they are immune to reason. Consequently, in my decision, I have tried ridicule as a last resort.\\" In a novel twist, Judge Quinn granted the wife, Catherine, sole custody of the feuding couple's 13-year-old daughter. However, he ordered Larry to pay Catherine just a dollar a month in spousal support. Judge Quinn expressed disgust with the way Catherine has induced her daughter to detest her father. \\"The harm is irreparable,\\" he said. \\"Generally, it is unwise to place an immature 13-year-old in charge of her life. Here, however, Catherine and [her current partner]have engineered an alienation that is so complete as to leave the court with no feasible option.\\" Toronto lawyer Phil Epstein, an expert in family law, describes Judge Quinn as a respected jurist who was justified in ridiculing the couple. \\"I'm sure there will be some who criticize Justice Quinn for this,\\" he said. \\"But others will say that sometimes you have to step back and laugh at the foibles of mankind.\\" Family law judges spent their time dealing with inflamed litigants whose stories are \\"highly conflicting and replete with inappropriate behaviour and misconduct,\\" Mr. Epstein said. \\"They use the courtroom as a forum for all the wrongs that have been done to them in their marriage. It is not surprising that some judges try to find a better way to help resolve their problems.\\" Alternating caustic gibes with amusing observations, Judge Quinn portrayed Catherine - a 36-year-old school caretaker - and Larry, a labourer, as vile, foul-mouthed creatures who had burned through an enormous amount of police and court time waging their futile blitzkrieg. He said that they cannot attend their son's ball hockey games without erupting into loud conflict, and that Catherine once tried to run over Larry with a van. \\"This is always a telltale sign that a husband and wife are drifting apart,\\" Judge Quinn remarked dryly. On three occasions, a niece of Catherine's who is engaged to a Hells Angels biker called Larry to warn him that he would be shot dead, Judge Quinn said. \\"On Oct. 18, 2007, a nautical theme was added,\\" he remarked. \\"According to Larry, 'Catherine's sister-in-law yelled out her window that I was going to be floating in the canal dead.'\\" Judge Quinn said that Larry, 38, possesses \\"a near-empty parenting tool box,\\" and was fond of venting his anger by sending Catherine insulting text messages and giving her 'the finger' as he drove by her home. \\"A finger is worth a thousand words and therefore, is particularly useful should one have a vocabulary of less than a thousand words,\\" Judge Quinn added. Catherine gave her children \\"advanced animosity-tutoring,\\" and repeatedly denied Larry access to them, Judge Quinn said. He said that on one occasion, Larry and his daughter were thrown out of a McDonald's restaurant because she was yelling that he was 'a deadbeat.' \\"This is language she would have learned from Catherine,\\" Judge Quinn noted. \\"They are the result of persistent, behind-the-scenes brainwashing by Catherine.\\" He said that Catherine also warned the children several times that if they attempted to telephone their father, they would go to jail. She also once text messaged her daughter while she was on an access visit with Larry to ask: \\"Is dickhead there?\\" Judge Quinn said that he foolishly called a four-month hiatus during the trial in the hope that Larry and Catherine could benefit from mediation. \\"It is touching how a trial judge can retain his naivety even after 15 years on the bench,\\" he said.

The Jonang school was widely thought to have become extinct in the late 17th century at the hands of the 5th Dalai Lama, who forcibly annexed the Jonang monasteries to his Gelug school, declaring them heretical. - The Nyingma tradition is the oldest of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism (the other three being the Kagyu, Sakya and Gelug). \\"Nyingma\\" literally means \\"ancient,\\" and is often referred to as Ngangyur (, \\"school of the ancient translations\\" or \\"old school\\") because it is founded on the first translations of Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit into Old Tibetan in the eighth century. The Tibetan alphabet and grammar was actually created for this endeavour. - The Kagyu, Kagyü, or Kagyud school, also known as the \\"\\"Oral Lineage\\"\\" or \\"Whispered Transmission\\" school, is today regarded as one of six main schools (\\"chos lugs\\") of Himalayan or Tibetan Buddhism, the other five being the Nyingma, Sakya, Jonang, Gelug and Bon. Along with the Sakya and Gelug schools, the Kagyu tradition is classified as one of the Sarma or \\"New Transmission\\" schools of Vajrayna founded during the second diffusion of Buddhism into Tibet (diffusing the so-called \\"New Tantras\\"). It is a Red Hat sect along with the Nyingma and Sakya. - Classical Tibetan refers to the language of any text written in Tibetic after the Old Tibetan period; though it extends from the 7th century until the modern day, it particularly refers to the language of early canonical texts translated from other languages, especially Sanskrit. The phonology implied by Classical Tibetan orthography is basically identical to the phonology of Old Tibetan, but the grammar varies greatly depending on period and geographic origin of the author. Such variation is an under-researched topic. - Bon or Bön is a Tibetan religion, which self-identifies as being distinct from Tibetan Buddhism, although it shares the same overall teachings and terminology. It arose in the eleventh century and established its scriptures mainly from termas and visions by tertöns such as Loden Nyingpo. Though Bon terma contain myths of Bon existing before the introduction of Buddhism in Tibet, \\"in truth the 'old religion' was a new religion.\\" - The Samye Monastery or Samye Gompa (Chinese:) is the first Buddhist monastery built in Tibet. It was probably first constructed between 775-9 CE under the patronage of King Trisong Detsen of Tibet who sought to revitalize Buddhism, which had declined since its introduction by King Songtsän Gampo in the 7th century. The monastery is in Dranang, Lhoka Prefecture. It was supposedly modeled on the design of Odantapuri in what is now Bihar, India. - Tibetan Buddhism is the body of Buddhist doctrine and institutions characteristic of Tibet, the regions surrounding the Himalayas and much of Central Asia. It derives from the latest stages of Indian Buddhism and preserves \\"the Tantric status quo of eighth-century India.\\" Tibetan Buddhism aspires to Buddhahood or rainbow body. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - In Mahayana Buddhism, bodhisattva is the Sanskrit term for anyone who, motivated by great compassion, has generated bodhicitta, which is a spontaneous wish to attain buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings. Bodhisattvas are a popular subject in Buddhist art. - Daklha Gampo ( Dwags lha sgam po ) is a Kagyu monastery founded in 1121 CE by Je Gampopa ( 1079 - 1153 ) , the disciple of the famous and much - loved bodhisattva , Jetsun Milarepa ( c. 1052 -- c. 1135 ) It is located in Gyatsa County in the old district of Dakpo in southern Tibet on land sanctified as a geomantic power - place ( ' head of the ogress ' ) by the first Tibetan emperor , Songtsen Gampo ( 605 or 617 ? - 649 ) , and made a repository of terma by Padmasambhava . - In Buddhism, bodhicitta (\\"putixin\\" \\"bodaishin\\" Wylie transliteration: \\"byang chub kyi sems\\" Vietnamese: B- tâm), \\"enlightenment-mind\\", is the mind that strives toward awakening, empathy and compassion for the benefit of all sentient beings. - Songtsen Gampo (569649?/605649?) was the founder of the Tibetan Empire, and is traditionally credited with the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet, influenced by his Nepali and Chinese queens, as well as being the unifier of what were previously several Tibetan kingdoms. He is also regarded as responsible for the creation of Tibetan alphabet and therefore the establishment of Classical Tibetan, the language spoken in his region at the time, as the literary language of Tibet. - Sanskrit (English pronunciation:; written in Devanagari script ; : or ', originally ', \\"refined speech\\") is the primary sacred language of Hinduism and \\"Mahyna\\" Buddhism, a philosophical language in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. It was also a literary language that was in use as a \\"lingua franca\\" in ancient and medieval South Asia. It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies. - The Tibetan alphabet is an abugida used to write the Tibetic languages such as Tibetan, as well as Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Ladakhi, and sometimes Balti. The printed form of the alphabet is called uchen script while the hand-written cursive form used in everyday writing is called umê script. - The Sakya (\\"pale earth\\") school is one of four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism, the others being the Nyingma, Kagyu, and Gelug. It is one of the Red Hat sects along with the Nyingma and Kagyu. - The Gelug, Gelug-pa, dGe Lugs Pa, dge-lugs-pa or Dgelugspa is the newest of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism. It was founded by Je Tsongkhapa (13571419), a philosopher and Tibetan religious leader. The first monastery he established was named Ganden, and to this day the Ganden Tripa is the nominal head of the school, though its most influential figure is the Dalai Lama. Allying themselves with the Mongols as a powerful patron, the Gelug emerged as the pre-eminent Buddhist school in Tibet since the end of the 16th century. - In Tibetan Buddhism, the Red Hat sect or Red Hat sects, named for the colour of the monks' hats at formal occasions, includes the three oldest of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism, namely: - Buddhism (or ) is a religion and dharma that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on teachings attributed to the Buddha. Buddhism originated in India sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, from where it spread through much of Asia, whereafter it declined in India during the middle ages. Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Theravada (Pali: \\"The School of the Elders\\") and Mahayana (Sanskrit: \\"The Great Vehicle\\"). Buddhism is the world's fourth-largest religion, with over 500 million followers or 7% of the global population, known as Buddhists. - Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked central Himalayan country in South Asia. It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area. Bordering China in the north and India in the south, east, and west, it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state. Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language. - Trisong Detsän or Trisong Detsen was the son of Me Agtsom and one of the emperors of Tibet. He ruled from 755 until 797 or 804 CE. Trisong Detsen was the second of the Three Dharma Kings of Tibet, playing a pivotal role in the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet and the establishment of the Nyingma or \\"Ancient\\" school of Tibetan Buddhism. - In Buddhism, buddhahood (, or ) is the condition or rank of a buddha (or , , Pali/Sanskrit for \\"awakened one\\"). - Tibet (Tibetan Pinyin: \\"boe\\", ; /i ts¹/) is a region on the Tibetan Plateau in Asia. It is the traditional homeland of the Tibetan people as well as some other ethnic groups such as Monpa, Qiang, and Lhoba peoples and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui people. Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of . The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848 m (29,029 ft) above sea level. - Buddhist art is the artistic practices that are influenced by Buddhism. It includes art media which depict Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and other entities; notable Buddhist figures, both historical and mythical; narrative scenes from the lives of all of these; mandalas and other graphic aids to practice; as well as physical objects associated with Buddhist practice, such as vajras, bells, stupas and Buddhist temple architecture. Buddhist art originated on the Indian subcontinent following the historical life of Siddhartha Gautama, 6th to 5th century BC, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world. - Padmasambhava (lit. \\"Lotus-Born\\"), also known as Guru Rinpoche, was an 8th-century Indian Buddhist master. Although there was a historical Padmasambhava, nothing is known of him apart from helping the construction of the first Buddhist monastery in Tibet at Samye, at the behest of Trisong Detsen, and shortly thereafter leaving Tibet due to court intrigues.

Imagine you are standing in a farm field in central Illinois. The land is so flat you can see for miles and miles. On a clear day, you might see a grain silo 20 miles away. You might think to yourself, it sure is flat around here. If you drive one hundred miles to the south, the landscape changes. In southern Illinois, there are rolling hills. Why do you think this is? What could have caused these features? There are no big rivers that may have eroded and deposited this material. The ground is capable of supporting grass and trees, so wind erosion would not explain it. To answer the question, you need to go back 12,000 years. Around 12,000 years ago, a giant ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States. Springfield, Illinois, was covered by over a mile of ice. Its hard to imagine a mile thick sheet of ice. The massive ice sheet, called a glacier, caused the features on the land you see today. Where did glaciers go? Where can you see them today? Glaciers are masses of flowing ice. Do you have any questions?","completion":"Your observation about the difference in the landscape between central and southern Illinois is intriguing. There are several factors that have contributed to these differences, one of which, as you mentioned, is the impact of glaciers from around 12,000 years ago. The Laurentide Ice Sheet, a massive ice sheet that covered much of the Midwest during the last Ice Age, played a significant role in shaping the landscape of the region. As the ice sheet advanced, it scraped and eroded the underlying bedrock, depositing tons of sediment as it moved. When the ice sheet eventually retreated, it left behind a flattened landscape, which is characteristic of central Illinois. The retreating ice also deposited large amounts of soil, rock, and debris as it melted, further contributing to the flat topography of this area. In contrast, southern Illinois was not as heavily impacted by the glacier's advance and retreat. The terrain in southern Illinois is part of the Ozark Plateau and the Shawnee Hills, which had experienced a more complex geological past. The rolling hills you observe in this region are a result of millions of years of erosion and sediment deposition. Uplifting and folding of the earth's crust have also contributed to the formation of these geological structures. In addition to these geological factors, the difference in elevation between central and southern Illinois has a direct influence on the capacity to support vegetation. You might observe that the central Illinois area primarily supports grasses and crops, while southern Illinois contains thicker, more diverse woodlands. This is due to differences in soil composition and moisture availability that result from variations in elevation and topography. As for the glaciers of today, they can still be found in various parts of the world, primarily in colder and higher-altitude regions. Some prominent examples include the glaciers in Greenland, Antarctica, Alaska, the Canadian Arctic, the Himalayas, and the Andes. Most of these glaciers are remnants of past ice ages, while others have formed more recently due to fluctuations in climate. These glaciers serve as important indicators of climate change, as their levels of growth or retreat can offer valuable insights into global temperature trends. I hope this helps you better understand the contrasting landscapes of Illinois and the role of glaciers in shaping our world.

So, the correct answer is A: more. Here's a step-by-step analysis of how more coal pits would affect the given process: 1. More coal pits opened: This would lead to an increased coal supply. 2. Coal is put in a coal-fired steam station: With more coal available, more coal can be fed into the steam station, potentially increasing the power generation capacity. 3. Water is put in pipes: Water quantity remains the same, as the availability of more coal does not affect water resources directly. 4. Coal is crushed: More coal would have to be crushed due to the increased coal supply. 5. Coal is moved into a boiler along with hot air: More coal would be fed into the boiler, raising the combustion rate and potentially generating more heat. 6. The water is moving through pipes in the boiler: Water continues to move through pipes, turning into steam as it heats up. With more heat from the increased coal combustion, water might turn into steam faster. 7. The steam from the water is blown against a turning mechanism: The mechanism (usually a turbine) could potentially turn faster or more efficiently due to increased steam production. 8. The force of the steam makes the mechanism turn: The increased steam might produce more force, causing the mechanism to turn at a higher rate. 9. The mechanism generates electricity: With the mechanism turning at a higher rate, more electricity could be generated. In conclusion, opening more coal pits would result in more coal being available for the coal-fired steam station, potentially increasing the electricity generated from the process.

Problem:Hundreds clashed with women to prevent them from entering the Sabarimala shrine last week, despite a historic Supreme Court ruling. Violent protests were also held in different parts of the state, defying the police's appeal for peace. The temple has historically been closed to women of \\"menstruating age\\". A senior police officer told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi that the protesters, including both men and women, have been arrested for rioting and unlawful assembly. \\"We have arrested those who prevented women from entering the temple and also those who violently protested against the court's order. We hope that this will act as a deterrent when the temple reopens in November,\\" the officer said. The temple only opens for brief periods throughout the year. Massive protests meant that very few women attempted to enter the temple last week and those who tried were forced to turn back. Protesters believe that the ruling goes against the wishes of the deity, Lord Ayappa, himself. They say that the ban on women entering Sabarimala is not about menstruation alone - it is also in keeping with the wish of the deity who is believed to have laid down clear rules about the pilgrimage to seek his blessings. According to the temple's mythology, Lord Ayyappa is an avowed bachelor who has taken an oath of celibacy, hence the ban on the entry of women. Hinduism regards menstruating women as unclean and bars them from participating in religious rituals. While most Hindu temples allow women to enter as long as they are not menstruating, the Sabarimala temple was unusual in that it was one of the few that did not allow women in a broad age group to enter at all. This was overturned by the Supreme Court last month, with judges observing that \\"the right to practice religion is available to both men and women\\". The temple did open its doors to women last week as directed by the court ruling. However, not a single woman was able to enter because of the protesters. Two women managed to reach the main temple premises last week. More than 100 policemen protected them from stone-throwing protesters as they walked the last 5km (3-mile) stretch to the shrine. But they had to turn back after a stand-off with devotees just metres from Sabarimala's sanctum.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: On the evening of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.By noon the next day they had covered 311 miles (501 km) from the Cape Denison hut. Mertz was ahead on skis, breaking trail. Mawson sat on the first sledge; Ninnis walked beside the second. In his diary that night, Mertz recounted: Around 1 pm, I crossed a crevasse, similar to the hundred previous ones we had passed during the last weeks. I cried out \\"crevasse!\\", moved at right angle, and went forward. Around five minutes later, I looked behind. Mawson was following, looking at his sledge in front of him. I couldn't see Ninnis, so I stopped to have a better look. Mawson turned round to know the reason I was looking behind me. He immediately jumped out of his sledge, and rushed back. When he nodded his head, I followed him, driving back his sledge. Ninnis, his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse 11 feet (3.4 m) wide with straight, ice walls. On a ledge deep in the hole, Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs—one still alive, but seriously injured—and the remains of Ninnis' sledge. There was no sign of their companion. They measured the distance to the ledge as 150 feet (46 m), too far for their ropes to reach. \\"Dog ceased to moan shortly\\", wrote Mawson in his diary that night. \\"We called and sounded for three hours, then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations.

Monica was absolutely shattered. Complete the following sentence. Patricia just filed for divorce and needed to talk to Monica because","completion":"\\"Patricia just filed for divorce and needed to talk to Monica because she was absolutely shattered.\\" Justification: The task requires completing the provided sentence in a meaningful way using one of the available choices. The choices given are: (1). Patricia was absolutely shattered. (2). Monica was absolutely shattered. Considering the context of the sentence, it seems that Patricia is going through a tough time emotionally due to her recent decision to file for divorce. It is a common scenario for individuals in such situations to seek out support from friends or family, in this case, Monica. Thus, the appropriate choice is \\"Patricia was absolutely shattered\\". This aligns with the preceding information about Patricia's emotional state post-filing for divorce, and provides a reason for her urge to talk to Monica. The idea is Patricia's emotional state (being shattered) drives her to seek out conversation with Monica, presumably for moral support or help.

Article: The gang were reported to have made off with 300 gold and 200 silver items of jewellery, the cost of which is still being assessed. The thieves appeared to have drawn their inspiration from the 'The Red-Headed League,' a popular Sherlock Holmes story that was first published in 1891, while the police said they were still trying to work out the value of what had been stolen. In 'The Red-Headed League', rated by Conan Doyle as one of his best stories, a pair of robbers digs up the basement of a pawn broker's shop in 19th century London in order to break into a bank vault next door. The thieves get the shop's red-haired owner out of their way by hiring him for an invented but well-paid clerical job. The owner is improbably told that only people with red hair are eligible to do the job. Holmes solves the bizarre case quickly, thwarting the theft by waiting for the thieves in the bank vault and catching them red-handed. \\"The criminals dismantled a brick wall in the flat and then got into the shop where they stole various adornments,\\" said one police source. They bought a flat located next to a jeweller's shop in St. Petersburg, Russia's second city, three weeks before the theft. The flat shared a common wall with the jewellery shop next door, and neighbours said they thought nothing of it when they heard drilling and hammering, assuming that the flat's new owners were renovating the place. The gang finally knocked a hole all the way through into the jewellery shop last weekend, triggering an alarm in the process. But the security guards who responded to the alarm twice assumed nothing was wrong as the doors and windows of the shop showed no signs of a break-in from the outside. ||||| St Petersbourg are no doubt wishing that Sherlock Holmes could give them a helping hand on this most curious incident. (MAXIM MARMUR/GETTY) Russian police have said that culprits behind a jewellery heist in St Petersburg used a Sherlock Holmes novel as the blueprint for the robbery. Mimicking 120-year-old short story The Red-Headed League from the Sherlock Holmes series by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the gang paid a 74-year-old woman in St Petersburg to leave her flat, which was next door to a jeweller, and then tunnelled through her walls to gain access to the jewellery shop and stole hundreds of gold and silver valuables. The burglar alarm in the shop sounded twice during the raid but security guards dismissed it as a false alarm because the doors and windows of the shop were still locked. Story continues below Advertisement Although the exact trick used to coax the woman out of her flat is still unknown, Russian police believe that it might have been the exact same ruse employed by the criminals on The Red-Headed League. In the book, fictional shop keep Jabez Wilson is lured away from his premises on the promise of a highly paid job for a bogus company that is only open to red-headed men. In the 1892 novel, the would-be robbers are caught by Sherlock Holmes who foils their plans by waiting in the bank vault for them to arrive through the walls. In St Petersbourg, however, there was no such obstacle for these literary-loving jewellery thieves. One St Petersburg policeman said: “Where was Sherlock when we needed him?”. He went on to add that the gang got away clean, leaving no traces at the scene of the crime. |||||Summary:","completion":"A gang of thieves in St. Petersburg, Russia, pulled off a jewellery heist seemingly inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story, \\"The Red-Headed League.\\" The criminals paid a 74-year-old woman to leave her flat, which was next to a jeweller's shop, and then tunneled through her walls to gain access to the store.

Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: Madonna starred in the film \\"Swept Away,\\" which was directed by Guy Ritchie. \\"Swept Away\\" is a romantic comedy film released in 2002, featuring Madonna in the leading role. The movie is an adaptation of the 1974 Italian film \\"Swept Away... by an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August,\\" which was directed by Lina Wertmüller. Guy Ritchie, a prominent British director known for movies such as \\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\\" (1998) and \\"Snatch\\" (2000), took on the challenge of directing and writing the script for this remake. The storyline revolves around a wealthy socialite named Amber Leighton (played by Madonna) who is forced to change her perspective on life when she becomes stranded on a deserted island with a fellow castaway, a communist sailor named Giuseppe Esposito (played by Adriano Giannini). Over time, their relationship transforms from animosity to a passionate romance fueled by the challenges of surviving on the remote island with only each other. \\"Swept Away\\" received mixed to negative reviews from critics, with many pointing out the lack of chemistry between the lead actors as well as the weak dialogue and storyline. However, despite its underwhelming reception, the film did garner appreciation for its stunning locations and cinematography. Guy Ritchie and Madonna were married at the time of filming. They began dating in the late 1990s, got engaged on December 2000, and married in Skibo Castle in Scotland on December 22, 2000. The couple filed for divorce in 2008, with their divorce being finalized in January 2009.

Step 1: Analyze the title \\"The Islamic Globe\\" seems to be a combination of two words: \\"Islamic\\" and \\"Globe.\\" The word \\"Islamic\\" indicates a connection to the religion of Islam, while \\"Globe\\" implies a worldwide or geographical aspect. Step 2: Compare possible meanings with categories Now, I will go through the categories and assess if \\"The Islamic Globe\\" fits into each category: 1. Company - It is possible but seems unlikely, as there is no clear indication that this title refers to a business entity. 2. Educational Institution - It could be an institution providing education in Islamic studies with worldwide operations or campuses, but there is no direct association. 3. Artist - This is unlikely, as the title doesn't resemble a person's name or stage name. 4. Athlete - Similar to above, it doesn't resemble a person's name or stage name. 5. Office Holder - This title doesn't match a typical office position within a government or organization. 6. Mean of Transportation - It doesn't seem to be related to a vehicle or transportation method. 7. Building - It could potentially refer to a building, like a mosque or Islamic center, but the term \\"Globe\\" doesn't usually fit for naming a building. 8. Natural Place - Unlikely, since it doesn't refer to any specific geographic location or feature. 9. Village - Similar to above, it doesn't refer to a specific location or settlement. 10. Animal - It's not related to any known animal species. 11. Plant - It's not related to any known plant species. 12. Album - Possible but unlikely; the title could be related to an artistic work focused on Islamic culture or history, but it doesn't resemble a traditional album title. 13. Film - Similar to the album, it could be a film about Islamic culture or history, but the connection isn't strong. 14. Written Work - \\"The Islamic Globe\\" could be a book or an article discussing the global influence, history, or aspects of Islamic culture or religion. This seems more fitting than other categories, as written works often have versatile titles that cover a broad range of topics. Based on the analysis, I would categorize \\"The Islamic Globe\\" under the \\"Written Work\\" category, as it seems the most fitting for the title, given its potential meaning related to Islamic culture, history, or religion on a global scale."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Broward Sheriff's Office reported Wednesday that 46-year-old Michelle Nicholas is charged with grand theft and exploitation of the elderly. Michelle Nicholas, 46, from South Florida, known as the Sweetheart Scammer has been released on bond after she was arrested for allegedly conning an elderly man out of thousands of dollars After coming back from their getaway,","completion":"Michelle Nicholas began asking John Deam for financial assistance under false pretenses. She claimed to be in desperate need of money due to various fabricated issues, such as unpaid medical bills, debts, and other emergencies. As Deam continued to provide her with financial support, Nicholas would manipulate him into giving her more and more, even going as far as to convince him to purchase expensive items such as a luxury car and a Rolex watch. John Deam was unaware of Nicholas' intentions and criminal background. Unfortunately, he fell victim to her calculated and deceitful tactics. The 82-year-old man, who had likely hoped for genuine companionship from Nicholas, was ultimately left emotionally and financially devastated. The Sweetheart Scammer's criminal activity caught the attention of the authorities, leading to an extensive investigation by the Broward Sheriff's Office. They worked diligently to collect evidence of Nicholas' crimes and build a strong case against her. Through their efforts, they obtained substantial proof that she had exploited several other vulnerable elderly individuals over the past few years. The authorities believe that Nicholas specifically targeted people of a certain age and social status, preying on their loneliness and sense of trust. Upon her arrest, Michelle Nicholas was charged with grand theft and exploitation of the elderly. She was brought to court to face the consequences of her actions and held accountable for the suffering she had caused. During her trial, evidence of her manipulative tactics, previous criminal activity, and the impact of her actions on the victims were presented to the judge and jury. The prosecution argued that Nicholas posed a significant threat to society, specifically to the elderly population, and should be dealt with severely to prevent any future harm. As the trial progressed, stories from her previous victims were brought to light, reinforcing the extent of her manipulation and deception. Many of these individuals also experienced financial losses and emotional distress as a result of their interactions with Nicholas. After careful deliberation, the jury found Michelle Nicholas guilty of her charges. The judge presiding over the case took into consideration the impact of her actions on her victims and the potential danger she posed to society. Consequently, the judge sentenced her to a significant amount of time behind bars, in addition to ordering her to pay restitution to the victims for the financial losses they suffered as a result of her crimes. Since her arrest and conviction, the case of the Sweetheart Scammer has brought increased awareness to the issue of financial crimes targeting the elderly. Law enforcement agencies are now working to educate the public on the signs of scams and the importance of being vigilant when dealing with financial matters, especially when it involves strangers or online acquaintances. The story of Michelle Nicholas serves as a cautionary tale for those seeking companionship and love, reminding us to be wary of individuals that may be looking to take advantage of our vulnerabilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more. Conflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation. Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings. People liked to be listened to. The illusion of having a voice was almost as good as actually having one. Isn't that why people still bothered to go to the polls on election day and vote? And it worked on most people. This woman was not one of them. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is probably true about Ray?

Read this: A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.

Process: - Food is taken into the mouth - The food is chewed - Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down - The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach - The stomach secretes acid - Grinds and mixes the food - The food moves to the small intestine - The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food - The food passes into the colon - The food is expelled from the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose High caloric meats and happens, how will it affect \\"Food cant be processed fully\\". Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this scenario suggests that the consumption of high caloric meats could affect the full processing of food in the digestive system. To determine whether this hypothesis holds true, let's examine the possible direct or indirect effects of high caloric meats on the overall digestive process. 1. Food is taken into the mouth: The consumption of high caloric meats would not have a direct or indirect effect on this step, as the physical act of taking food in the mouth isn't impacted by the type of food being consumed. 2. The food is chewed: High caloric meats might require more chewing compared to other types of food, but this would not have a direct effect on the ability to fully process the food. Chewing helps break down the food into smaller particles and mix it with saliva to initiate the digestive process. 3. Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down: High caloric meats may lead to the secretion of more saliva due to a higher protein content, which requires more amylase (enzyme found in saliva) for breaking down food. However, this shouldn't inhibit the food's full processing. 4. The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach: High caloric meats should not have a direct or indirect effect on this step, as the movement of food down the esophagus is a physical process not impacted by the type of food being consumed. 5. The stomach secretes acid, grinds, and mixes the food: The impact of high caloric meats on this stage might be slightly indirect, as these foods might take longer to digest due to their high fat and protein content. Nonetheless, proper functioning stomach will still be able to secrete the necessary acids and enzymes to process high caloric meats. 6. The food moves to the small intestine: High caloric meats, particularly those high in fats, require more bile and pancreatic enzymes for digestion. This might increase the workload in the small intestine, but a well-functioning digestive system should still effectively process these foods. 7. The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food: Again, high caloric meats may require a higher production of enzymes due to the increased fat and protein content, but a healthy small intestine should adapt and release the necessary enzymes for digestion. 8. The food passes into the colon: During the absorption of nutrients in the small intestine, high caloric meats might result in a higher amount of undigested fats or proteins reaching the colon. However, this should not directly affect the capability to process the food fully. 9. The food is expelled from the body: High caloric meats should not directly affect the expulsion of waste from the body. If the digestive system is functioning properly, the body should be able to expel any waste products produced during digestion. In conclusion, while the consumption of high caloric meats might impose additional demands on the digestive system, it should not directly affect the overall processing of food in a well-functioning digestive system. However, individuals with pre-existing digestive issues might experience difficulty in processing high caloric meats fully, leading to indigestion or other gastrointestinal problems."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - An exploitation film is a film that attempts to succeed financially by exploiting current trends, niche genres, or lurid content. - A brothel or bordello is a place where people may come to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute, sometimes referred to as a sex worker.

Article:","completion":"Title: Ex-Military Chiefs Propose Boosting Special Forces Operations to Combat Fanatics in Northern Iraq In recent developments, former military chiefs have proposed enhancing the operations of Special Forces in an attempt to disrupt and 'spoil the day' of fanatics, such as British Muslims, operating in northern Iraq. Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon and Air Commodore Andrew Lambert have called for Britain to escalate its military options in response to the increasing terrorist activities taking place in the region. This call to action follows the horrific murder of US journalist James Foley, apparently by a British jihadist, in what was claimed to be an act of retribution for US-led airstrikes in the region. The ex-military chiefs emphasize the urgency of stepping up the operations of the Special Forces to counter the rise of radical activities perpetrated by individuals, including British citizens, in Iraq. The ongoing conflict in northern Iraq has attracted numerous foreign fighters from various parts of the world, including Britain, thus raising concerns over the situation's potential impact on national security. Air Chief Marshal Graydon and Air Commodore Lambert's proposition to ramp up military efforts in Iraq seeks to enhance the support for local forces on the ground, from combating terrorism to providing aid and training assistance. Special Forces would likely be tasked with gathering intelligence, conducting high-value target operations, and ensuring the safety of British and allied personnel present in the region. The gruesome murder of US journalist James Foley serves as a brutal reminder of the extent to which the fanatics are willing to go in their quest for supremacy and violence. The assailant, believed to be a British jihadist, declared the act as revenge for US-led airstrikes in Iraq. This incident brings to light the complexity of the situation, where citizens from seemingly peaceful countries can be radicalized and driven to commit atrocities in the name of a twisted cause. The suggestion made by the ex-military chiefs to increase the role of the Special Forces in Iraq comes at a time when the threat of global terrorism is higher than it has ever been. Their proposal aims to provide a more proactive approach to countering terrorism while assisting the local forces in their fight against violence. Boosting the operations of the Special Forces would thus represent a strategic response to an ever-growing security concern, both in Iraq and on a global scale. In conclusion, the proposal put forward by Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon and Air Commodore Andrew Lambert highlights the urgent need to combat the escalating terrorist activities in northern Iraq. By enhancing the role of the Special Forces in the region, Britain would be taking a decisive stance against the fanatics threatening the security and stability of not only Iraq but also Western nations. Strengthening the operations of the Special Forces will ensure that those who partake in such violence are identified, pursued, and ultimately brought to justice, while simultaneously thwarting the dangerous expansion of terrorist organizations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it.

Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Luigi Russolo (30 April 1885 6 February 1947) was an Italian Futurist painter, composer, builder of experimental musical instruments, and the author of the manifesto \\"The Art of Noises\\" (1913).

He designed and constructed a number of noise-generating devices called Intonarumori. - Futurism was an artistic and social movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century. It emphasized speed, technology, youth, and violence, and objects such as the car, the aeroplane, and the industrial city. Although it was largely an Italian phenomenon, there were parallel movements in Russia, England, Belgium and elsewhere. The Futurists practiced in every medium of art including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and even Futurist meals. Its key figures were the Italians Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, Antonio Sant'Elia, Bruno Munari, Benedetta Cappa and Luigi Russolo, the Russians Natalia Goncharova, Velimir Khlebnikov, Igor Severyanin, David Burliuk, Aleksei Kruchenykh and Vladimir Mayakovsky, the Belgian Jules Schmalzigaug and the Portuguese Almada Negreiros. It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past. Cubism contributed to the formation of Italian Futurism's artistic style. Important Futurist works included Marinetti's \\"Manifesto of Futurism\\", Boccioni's sculpture \\"Unique Forms of Continuity in Space\\", and Balla's painting \\"Abstract Speed + Sound\\" (pictured). To some extent Futurism influenced the art movements Art Deco, Constructivism, Surrealism, Dada, and to a greater degree Precisionism, Rayonism, and Vorticism. - Unique Forms of Continuity in Space is a bronze Futurist sculpture by Umberto Boccioni. It is seen as an expression of movement and fluidity. The sculpture is depicted on the obverse of the Italian-issue 20 cent euro coin. - Art Deco, or Deco, is a style of visual arts, architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I. It became popular in the 1920s and 1930s, and influenced the design of buildings, furniture, jewellery, fashion, cars, movie theatres, trains, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners. It took its name, short for \\"Arts Décoratifs\\", from the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris in 1925. It combined modernist styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress. - Antonio Sant'Elia (30 April 1888 10 October 1916) was an Italian architect and a key member of the Futurist movement in architecture.

This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes. Violence in many forms is preventable.

The album's theme is ambiguous, however, ongoing themes in the songs' lyrics suggest that the main character in question, Sonny, suffers from mental illness, resulting in the creation of many different personalities. The album alludes strongly to the dadaist movement: its cover was based on a painting by Salvador Dalí titled \\"Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire\\". Produced by long-time collaborator Bob Ezrin, at the time his first production with Cooper in six years, \\"DaDa\\" was recorded at ESP Studios in Buttonville, Ontario, Canada. - Vorticism was a short-lived modernist movement in British art and poetry of the early 20th century, partly inspired by Cubism. The movement was announced in 1914 in the first issue of \\"BLAST\\", which contained its manifesto and the movement's rejection of landscape and nudes in favour of a geometric style tending towards abstraction. Ultimately, it was their witnessing of unfolding human disaster in World War I that \\"drained these artists of their Vorticist zeal\\".

Evans has released eight studio albums: Three Chords and the Truth (1997), No Place That Far (1998), Born to Fly (2000), Restless (2003), Real Fine Place (2005), Stronger (2011), Slow Me Down (2014), Words (2017), plus one Christmas album, At Christmas (2014). Evans was born in Boonville, Missouri, in 1971, and is of Welsh, English, Irish, and Native American descent. She was raised on a farm near New Franklin, Missouri, the eldest girl of seven children. By five, she was singing weekends in her family's band. At the age of eight, she was struck by an automobile in front of the family home, and her legs suffered multiple fractures. Recuperating for months in a wheelchair, she continued singing to help pay her medical bills. When she was 16, she began performing at a nightclub near Columbia, Missouri, a gig that lasted two years. Evans moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1991 to be a country music artist. She met fellow musician Craig Schelske and left Nashville with him in 1992, moving to Oregon. They married in 1993. She returned to Nashville in 1995 and began recording demos. Nashville songwriter Harlan Howard was impressed by her demo of his song \\"Tiger by the Tail\\". He decided to help her music career, leading to a signed contract with RCA Nashville. In 1997, Evans released her debut album for RCA, Three Chords and the Truth. Although none of its three singles (\\"True Lies,\\" the title track, and \\"Shame About That\\") reached the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, the album received critical praise for its neotraditional country sound. In 1998, Evans released her second album, No Place That Far. The album's lead single, \\"Cryin' Game,\\" also failed to reach the Top 40. However, the album's second single and title track, gave Evans her first Number One hit on the Hot Country Songs chart in March 1999.

A: A:","completion":"The process responsible for the creation of the new seafloor at the mid-ocean ridge is known as seafloor spreading. To fully understand this phenomenon, it's important to learn about the Earth's structure, tectonic plates, and the mechanism involved in seafloor spreading. The Earth has multiple layers, the innermost being the core, followed by the mantle, and the outermost being the crust. The crust and the upper portion of the mantle form an integrated layer called the lithosphere, which is separated into solid sections known as tectonic plates. These plates consist of two types: oceanic plates that form the ocean floor and continental plates that form landmasses. The tectonic plates move due to the heat generated in the Earth's mantle, responsible for the movement and change of the Earth's crust. This heat-driven force, or convection currents, results from the slow circulation of hot material rising up to the crust and cooler material sinking back down into the mantle. Seafloor spreading occurs at the boundaries where two oceanic plates diverge, that is, they move apart from each other. Mid-ocean ridges are such boundaries formed by a series of underwater mountain ranges enveloping the globe, with the most prominent example being the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These ridges are the result of extensive tectonic activity and are characterized by frequent volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. As the tectonic plates diverge at the mid-ocean ridge, hot, molten material from the mantle below rises up towards the Earth's crust through a process known as upwelling. This upwelling brings along with it minerals and gases from deeper within the Earth. When the magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor, it cools and solidifies, forming new oceanic crust material. This newly formed crust adds to the existing oceanic plates and pushes them apart, like two slow-moving conveyor belts. As a result, over a period of millions of years, the seafloor expands, creating new ocean floor. This process has been instrumental in shaping the arrangement of our continents, as well as the current configuration of the Earth's oceans. Fossil records, paleomagnetism, and ocean floor spreading age data further support the concept of seafloor spreading. As the new seafloor forms and moves away from the ridge, it takes with it a record of the Earth's magnetic polarity at the time of its formation. This creates a pattern of magnetic stripes on the ocean floor parallel to the mid-ocean ridges, which has been instrumental in providing evidence for the theory of seafloor spreading and, consequently, the larger theory of plate tectonics. In conclusion, the creation of the new seafloor at the mid-ocean ridge is primarily driven by seafloor spreading, which results from the diverging tectonic plates and the upwelling of hot, molten material from the mantle. This process has played a crucial role in shaping the Earth's geology, including the arrangement of continents and the structure of the ocean floor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: The Ultimate Guide to Engaging Your Cat's Curiosity and Keeping Them Entertained Introduction Cats are curious creatures by nature, and often their curiosity leads them to some less-than-ideal situations, such as getting fixated on doors or trying to escape outside. This article outlines the perfect way to divert your cat's attention from the door, keep them entertained indoors, and even safely let them explore the great outdoors. Step 1: Distract Your Cat from the Door Whether it's because they want to escape or they hear a sound outside, cats often become fascinated with doors. To prevent your cat from becoming obsessed with a specific door, follow these steps: 1. Identify your cat's trigger: Determine what is causing your cat to focus on the door, such as a noise or a gap under the door. 2. Block visual access: Use a screen or tall barrier to obscure your cat's view of the door. 3. Create a diversion: Place toys, puzzles, or treats in areas away from the door to entice your cat to explore elsewhere. 4. Use positive reinforcement: Reward your cat with praise or treats when they leave the door and engage with the distractions provided. Step 2: Provide Entertainment for Your Cat To keep your cat's interest in indoor activities, try these creative entertainment ideas: 1. Interactive toys: Toys that require your cat's interaction, like treat puzzles or remote-controlled mice, can keep them engaged for hours. 2. Window perches: Cats love to observe the world around them, so provide them with a comfortable perch near a window to watch birds or squirrels. 3. Feather wands or laser pointers: Encourage your cat to exercise their hunting skills by playing with them using these tools. 4. Climbing trees and scratching posts: Cats love to climb and scratch, so investing in these structures can keep them entertained and prevent damage to your furniture. Step 3: Let Your Cat Explore the Great Outdoors Allowing your cat to safely explore the outdoors can satisfy their curiosity and reduce their interest in doors. Here are a few ways to give your cat a taste of the great outdoors: 1. Leash training: With patience and persistence, cats can be leash trained, allowing you to take your feline friend on supervised walks. 2. Enclosed outdoor spaces: If you have a yard, consider setting up a secure outdoor cat enclosure or \\"catio,\\" complete with climbing structures, hiding spots, and places to sunbathe. 3. Window bird feeders: Distract your cat from the door by attracting birds to your window with a bird feeder, giving them something interesting to watch. 4. Encourage indoor/outdoor play: Make playtime more engaging by occasionally allowing your cat to chase after toys tossed outside, while supervising from within. Conclusion With these tactics in place, your cat's fascination with the door should diminish, and they'll be able to enjoy a variety of entertaining and safe activities, both inside and out. By addressing their curiosity, you're not only strengthening the bond between you and your feline friend, but you're also providing them with a stimulating and happy environment, which is essential to their well-being."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Put the papers, binders, and all the materials together in a folder.; -- Try to get an oddly sized binder, as its smaller size will build up on the pile you've spread out. If you want, you can use a standard sized binder to spread papers out.;","completion":"If you are using the binder for more than one class or subject, get a 3 or 5 inch binder. Get the 1 or 2 inch binders if you plan to use separate binders for each of your classes. When selecting a binder, the most important aspect is that it's the right size to hold all the materials you'll need for your classes or projects. It's critical to consider how many subjects or projects you'll be organizing in a single binder, as space will be essential for keeping things neat, tidy, and easily accessible. While the design of the binder may seem attractive, always remember that functionality should come first. Once you've selected the appropriate binder size, consider adding dividers or tabs to separate different classes or subjects. This way, you can easily flip to the section you need without having to shuffle through a disorganized stack of papers. You may want to consider getting color-coordinated dividers or labeling each section clearly to make it even easier to find the information you need. Next, invest in some clear sheet protectors and hole-punched folders. Sheet protectors are ideal for keeping important documents and handouts safe from damage, while hole-punched folders can hold any loose papers you may have. Additionally, having a few pockets or pouches in your binder can be helpful for storing pens, pencils, erasers, and other smaller items. To ensure your binder stays organized throughout the school year or duration of your project, make it a habit to file away any new materials as soon as you receive them. This prevents the buildup of unsorted papers and reduces the amount of time you'll need to spend reorganizing later on. Finally, take some time every few weeks to review the contents of your binder and do any necessary reorganizing. This may involve rearranging pages, updating labels, or removing any outdated or unnecessary materials. By staying on top of your binder's organization, you'll be better equipped to succeed in your classes or projects and less likely to feel overwhelmed by clutter. In summary, when organizing a binder, it's crucial to select the right size for your needs, divide the binder into clearly labeled sections, use sheet protectors and folders to store papers and materials, establish good habits to maintain organization, and periodically review the contents to ensure everything is up-to-date and organized. By following these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating an efficient and effective binder that will help you stay organized throughout the school year or the duration of your project."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They are like a big team who play together and work together to help make things better in their country. But sometimes, they don't agree on everything. This can make it hard for them to work together and stay as a strong team. A man named Smith is worried about this.

Boone County Legal Aid, which for 31 years has provided legal services to those who couldn't afford them, will close in February if a 10,000 grant from Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino is not awarded. The legal service is one of the few programs in Iowa that offers legal representation to those who qualify without turning to the state for its services. \\"It is a very sad situation, but that's the fact,\\" said Alan Schroeder, city attorney and supervisor of Boone County Legal Aid. For the past two years using money mostly from the city and county, Schroeder has upheld the outfit alone, taking on about 60 clients a year, and settling cases that range from domestic abuse to bankruptcy. He also has a private practice. If the legal service closes, he's unsure where his clients will go. The city of Boone gave Schroeder 6,300 in July to resolve pending cases, said Kathy Berg, Boone's finance officer. Without that, the program might already be closed. \\"All governments are having problems with finances,\\" Boone Mayor George Maybee said. \\"No one else stepped in. The county didn't. The state didn't.\\" Donovan Olson, chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, said the board quit funding the legal service in July because it felt the county didn't need it. Drake University ended its funding after the 2000 spring semester \\"for a variety of reasons,\\" Suzanne Levitt, the law professor who oversaw the program, said via e-mail. Olson said Schroeder must prove Prairie Meadows is the primary money source for the board to grant the program any more money. Schroeder ran the program without the help of law students or Drake, which had provided as much as two-thirds of the money in some years.

In Western countries like the United States, many women are now working and earning money outside their homes, with more than half of the women aged eighteen to sixty-five having good jobs. These women generally have more education than those who stay at home, and they are increasingly asserting their desire for equal chances of success as men. However, the best jobs are still often given to men, and women in many cases earn less than their male counterparts for the same work. On the other hand, women in the Middle East countries face more traditional constraints and expectations. They are typically expected to stay at home, take care of their families, and manage the household work, with limited opportunities to work outside the home. When they do venture out in public, they are often required to cover their faces and walk behind their husbands. Despite these limitations, the passage notes that the women's lives in the Middle East have been changing in recent years, with many women seeking to play an active role in society. Some challenges still remain, however, as men may still prefer to marry women in the old ways even if the women are working. In summary, from this passage, we know that women's roles and opportunities vary significantly across different regions and cultural contexts, with some progress being made towards gender equality in the workplace and in societal expectations.

Several major companies — Enterprise Holdings, First National Bank of Omaha, Symantec, Hertz and Avis — have ended co-branding partnerships with the National Rifle Association as a #BoycottNRA social media movement picks up steam. Enterprise — the parent company of car-rental brands Enterprise, Alamo and National — cut ties on Thursday, when it discontinued an arrangement that offered discounts to NRA members. Hertz, Avis Budget Group and TrueCar later followed suit. First National Bank of Omaha, one of the country’s largest privately held banks, also announced Thursday the end of a credit-card co-branding deal with the NRA. The bank had issued what its ads described as the “Official Credit Card of the NRA,” according to the Omaha World-Herald; the Visa card offered 5 percent back on gas and sporting goods store purchases and a 40 bonus card. On Friday, Symantec announced in a terse statement on Twitter that it had also ended its discount program with the gun-rights organization. The company, which provides cybersecurity solutions worldwide, had been offering discounts on Norton anti-virus and malware protection, cutting prices on its premium package from 110 to 48 for NRA members. Separately, insurance company Chubb Limited said Friday that it will stop underwriting “NRA Carry Guard,” a policy marketed to NRA members who face legal or civil lawsuits after they shoot someone. A spokesman for Chubb told Reuters that the company informed the NRA of the decision three months ago; the policy has faced criticism from gun-control groups who called it “murder insurance.” The decisions came as the names of companies with NRA associations began circulating widely on the Internet and social media under the #BoycottNRA hashtag after the deadly Valentine’s Day attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. A gunman wielding an AR-15 rifle killed 17 people and wounded at least 14 others, drawing anguished calls for a ban on assault weapons from students and families. The mass killing focused renewed attention on the NRA, which is credited with blocking gun-control measures for years through millions of dollars in political campaign contributions and pressure from its large membership base. American businesses have become increasingly politically aware and have participated in boycotts over the past few years against states over LGBT rights. But the NRA is a well-funded membership operation devoted to a single cause — guns — and unlikely to be moved by the actions of companies with which it has such loose and peripheral ties. Like many other organizations, the NRA has benefit deals with companies designed to make membership more appealing. The NRA “member benefits” page offers savings on a credit card, hearing aids, car rentals, travel, car purchases and prescription drugs. FedEx, for example, gives NRA Business Alliance members up to a 26 percent discount on shipping expenses. FedEx has not said anything publicly about its NRA association in recent days; when reached around 4:30 ET on Friday afternoon, a company spokesperson said he had no information to provide. Hashtags urging boycotts of specific companies involved in the deals have sprouted up across social media over the past several days. People then started posting comments on the social media platforms of many of the companies urging them to take action. The Omaha bank appears to have been the first to respond publicly. Customer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the NRA. As a result, First National Bank of Omaha will not renew its contract with the National Rifle Association to issue the NRA Visa Card. — First National Bank (@FNBOmaha) February 22, 2018 “Customer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the NRA,” the bank said in a statement posted on Twitter. “As a result, First National Bank of Omaha will not renew its contract with the National Rifle Association to issue the NRA Visa Card.” Enterprise followed a few hours later on Thursday. “All three of our brands have ended the discount for NRA members,” effective March 26 said a tweet on the Enterprise Rent-A-Car account. By Friday morning, Symantec had made a similar announcement. Symantec has stopped its discount program with the National Rifle Association. — Symantec (@symantec) February 23, 2018 Then came Hertz. On Friday evening, Alice Pereira, a spokeswoman for Avis Budget Group — the company mark for Avis, Budget and Zipcar brands — confirmed that it will no longer provide the NRA member discount as of March 26. TrueCar tweeted that it would end its car-buying service relationship with the NRA on Feb. 28. [Activists call for tech companies to drop NRA’s digital TV channel] Movers North American Van Lines and Allied Van Lines also disassociated their companies from the NRA. The insurer Metlife said it has terminated discounts offered to NRA members on the gun lobby group’s website, the Associated Press reported. The hotel chains Best Western and Wyndham Hotels also told social media users that they were no longer affiliated with the NRA, the AP reported. One activist listed more than a dozen brands who had severed NRA relationships: Meantime, gun-control organizations Moms Demand Action and Everytown sent a letter Friday asking five companies — Google, Amazon, Apple, AT&T; and Roku — to cease streaming NRATV, saying “it’s time for tech leaders to acknowledge their role in helping the NRA spread this dangerous content.” The NRA has not commented on the announcements. However, the World-Herald quoted Rod Moeller, director of government affairs for the Nebraska Firearms Owners Association, saying that the group will “be giving strong consideration to moving their accounts to a bank that hasn’t bowed to political pressure.” Boycott movements have become increasingly effective political tools over the past few years. Indiana got hit hard by threatened boycotts in 2015 when Gov. Mike Pence (R) signed legislation allowing businesses and individuals to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. The Indiana legislature and Pence reversed the measure within two weeks. In 2016, North Carolina was the target of a business boycott after it enacted a “bathroom bill” requiring transgender people to use bathrooms based on their assigned gender at birth. After the NCAA canceled tournaments in the state and PayPal decided not to build a new facility in the state, the legislation was partially repealed. The NRA claims 5 million members and corporate allies in the gun industry that provide the organization with tens of millions of dollars per year. The group devotes massive resources to fighting gun regulations in the name of the Second Amendment to the Constitution, which protects the right to bear arms. T.J.

First National Bank of Omaha was among the first to ditch the NRA when it announced Thursday that it would end a Visa credit card it had offered with NRA branding, citing a deluge of customer complaints. First National Bank of Omaha's breakup with the NRA put an end to a card that offered 5% back on gas and sporting goods purchases, according to an NRA blog, which boasted that \\"every time you pack up and head out on a hunt or to the range…. you’re putting money back in your pocket.\\" The moves suggest the NRA is losing a degree of support in the corporate world amid a firestorm of criticism over the group's support for gun rights despite recent killing sprees. \\"Banks and other companies are sensitive to being on the wrong side of a social media campaign, which can spread pretty quickly these days,\\" said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor who has taught classes on marketing. \\"They don’t want to risk having people march or boycott.\\" Still, Gordon said a widespread movement against NRA-affiliated companies was \\"unlikely\\" because most consumers don't change their behavior based on political issues. The NRA did not respond to a request for comment. CEO Wayne LaPierre told the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday that “as usual the opportunists wasted not one second to exploit tragedy for gain,\\" adding that gun control advocates and the media “hate the NRA, they hate the Second Amendment, they hate individual freedom.” ThinkProgress, a liberal website that describes itself as an editorially independent project of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, claimed credit for bringing attention to the corporate NRA connections. Companies that offer discounts to NRA members are \\"making membership to the group, which opposes nearly all gun safety legislation, more enticing,\\" ThinkProgress wrote.

The cybersecurity company's LifeLock identity theft protection service for businesses and its Norton anti-virus software had both offered discounts to NRA members. —Enterprise Holdings: The parent company of car rental brands Enterprise, Alamo and National announced on Twitter that it's ending discount deals with the NRA. —Hertz. Like Enterprise, car rental company Hertz also ended discounts to NRA members. —Avis and Budget: The company that owns the Avis and Budget rental car firms provides discounts to NRA members but said it would end that offer as of March 26. —TrueCar. The online car-buying service says that NRA members save an average of nearly 3,400 off the retail price of new and used vehicles. TrueCar representatives did not respond to a request seeking comment. —MetLife: The insurer had offered discounts to NRA members on auto and home policies before axing the deal. —SimpliSafe: The home security company had offered a special promotion to NRA members, but that ended Friday.

People on social media are calling for boycotts of companies including FedEx, Norton Security, Best Western, and Wyndham Hotels that offer — or have offered — special deals for NRA members. As part of their membership, NRA members receive discounts on things from renting cars to buying prescription drugs. However, while Wyndham Hotels previously offered a 10% discount to NRA members, the hotel chain no longer does so. Just a few of dozens of tweets denying ties to the NRA Wyndham This week, the Twitter accounts for Wyndham and its rewards program tweeted dozens of times that the hotel chain \\"is no longer affiliated with the NRA\\" in response to boycott threats. A Wyndham representative told Business Insider the company ended its relationship with the NRA in late 2017, prior to the school shooting in Parkland, Florida that sparked recent boycott efforts. Best Western has been similarly targeted by boycott efforts, as the hotel chain offered NRA members discounts as recently as 2016. In response, Best Western has tweeted dozens of times that the company \\"does not have an affiliation with and is not a corporate partner of the National Rifle Association.\\" Best Western \\"Best Western ended any association with the NRA in 2014,\\" a representative said in a statement to Business Insider. Both hotel chains have been targeted in past boycotts organized by gun control activists. In 2012, activist group Avaaz organized a boycott calling for Wyndham and Best Western to cut ties with the NRA following the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. At the time, both hotel chains were listed on the gun rights group's website as \\"friends of the NRA\\" and offered members discounts at hotels. \\"It's time for mainstream companies like Wyndham Hotels to get out of bed with the extremist NRA,\\" Avaaz campaigner Joseph Huff-Hannon said in 2012, The Guardian reported. The February 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School seems to be sparking similar calls for boycotts of companies with ties to the NRA — and producing results. On Thursday, the First National Bank of Omaha and rental-car giant Enterprise Holdings announced that they were cutting ties with the NRA after boycotts were organized on social media. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Several major companies, including Enterprise Holdings, First National Bank of Omaha, Symantec, Hertz and Avis, have ended co-branding partnerships with the National Rifle Association (NRA) in response to the #BoycottNRA social media campaign.

In the 1st quarter the Panthers trailed early as QB Josh Freeman made an 8-yard TD pass to WR Arrelious Benn. They narrowed the lead with kicker John Kasay hitting a 46-yard field goal. They struggled further in the second quarter with RB LeGarrette Blount getting a 17-yard TD run; but they replied with RB Josh Vaughan making a 2-yard TD run. Tampa Bay scored again when Freeman found TE Kellen Winslow on a 20-yard TD pass. The Panthers tried to cut the lead down with Kasay's 28- and 48-yard field goals, but the Buccaneers pulled away in the fourth quarter with kicker Connor Barth nailing a 32-yard field goal, and with RB Cadillac Williams getting a 45-yard TD run. Answer this question based on the article: How many yards shorter was John Kasay's second field goal compared to his first?","completion":"Okay, little buddy! In the story, John Kasay had two field goals. His first one was 46 yards and his second one was 28 yards. To find out how many yards shorter the second field goal was compared to the first, we just have to subtract 28 from 46. So, 46 minus 28 equals 18.

The first written record of St Kilda may date from 1202 when an Icelandic cleric wrote of taking shelter on \\"the islands that are called Hirtir\\". Early reports mentioned finds of brooches, an iron sword and Danish coins, and the enduring Norse place names indicate a sustained Viking presence on Hirta, but the visible evidence has been lost. In the late 14th century John of Fordun referred to it as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world'. The islands were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris, whose steward was responsible for the collection of rents in kind and other duties. The first detailed report of a visit to the islands dates from 1549, when Donald Munro suggested that: \\"The inhabitants thereof ar simple poor people, scarce learnit in aney religion, but M’Cloyd of Herray, his stewart, or he quhom he deputs in sic office, sailes anes in the zear ther at midsummer, with some chaplaine to baptize bairnes ther.\\"Despite the chaplain's best efforts, the islanders' isolation and dependence on the bounty of the natural world meant their philosophy bore as much relationship to Druidism as it did to Christianity until the arrival of Rev. John MacDonald in 1822. Macauley (1764) reported the existence of five druidic altars, including a large circle of stones fixed perpendicularly in the ground near the Stallir House on Boreray.Coll MacDonald of Colonsay raided Hirta in 1615, removing 30 sheep and a quantity of barley. Thereafter, the islands developed a reputation for abundance. At the time of Martin's visit in 1697 the population was 180 and the steward travelled with a \\"company\\" of up to 60 persons to which he \\"elected the most 'meagre' among his friends in the neighbouring islands, to that number and took them periodically to St. Kilda to enjoy the nourishing and plentiful, if primitive, fare of the island, and so be restored to their wonted health and strength.\\" A:","completion":"The present-day name of the place John Fordun referred to as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world' is St Kilda."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I knew that my daughter’s cat, who has been part of our family since my daughter was in second grade, was dying of a fast growing cancer. I couldn’t tell my daughter because I didn’t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred. I thanked her for the 14 years she had been one of my daughter’s closest companions and I held her as she took her last breath.

Everything needs salt, which honestly is kind of refreshing considering most restaurants over salt every thing. This taco was basically wet soft meat in a mushy tortilla. Queso fresco and some ripe tomatos could have saved this taco but neither was an option. You get meat, in a soggy tortilla, with onions on it. There are home made salsas available but both only added heat. not flavor. The next night I came back and tried the fajitas. You get a pile of gristly meat over pungent red peppers.

Since Tom is retired, he often has plenty of time to go fishing, and he even has a small cabin by the lake. The two men are planning to spend several days at the cabin cooking, fishing, chopping firewood to make fires and just general outdoor activities. Hint: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well.

They both indicate a decline in influence and a shift towards a more ordinary lifestyle. However, there are some key differences in the details and implications of these statements. Premise: \\"Their influence waned, and they began to be absorbed into the general population.\\" This statement suggests a gradual decline in the group's influence over a period of time. It indicates that the group did not abruptly lose their power or importance, but rather experienced a steady reduction of their sway. As their influence waned, the group started to integrate into the general population, becoming indistinguishable from the rest of society. This implies a loss of uniqueness or distinctiveness, as the group no longer maintained a separate or special status within the broader population. Hypothesis: \\"Their influence disappeared and they just went to live in the city.\\" This statement describes the group's influence vanishing, which indicates a more abrupt change in status. It does not convey the same sense of a gradual decline as the premise does. Instead, the group's influence is described as disappearing altogether, suggesting a potentially sudden and unexpected shift in power dynamics. Additionally, the hypothesis specifically references the group relocating to a city. This adds a geographic element to the situation, which is not present in the premise. While both the premise and the hypothesis communicate a decline in influence and integration into a larger community, they differ in the way this process occurs. The premise implies a more gradual decline and eventual absorption into the general population, whereas the hypothesis suggests a sudden disappearance of influence and a relocation to a city setting.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the name of the work that was likely influenced by Musidora? By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \\"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term.

We have -61*k + 48 + 74 = 0. First, let's add 48 and 74 together. So we have: -61*k + 122 = 0. Now, we want to get the k all by itself. To do that, we need to move the 122 to the other side of the equation. We'll do this by subtracting 122 from both sides: -61*k = -122. Almost there! Now to find k, we need to divide both sides by -61: k = -122 / -61. And when we do the math, we find that: k = 2! So the answer is k = 2. Good job!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: Some sheep that are wearing bells around their necks.","completion":"In the given sentence, \\"Some sheep that are wearing bells around their necks,\\" the most important words can be analyzed based on their contextual significance and roles within the sentence: 1. \\"sheep\\" - The word \\"sheep\\" is the central focus or subject of the sentence. It represents the entity being discussed. In this context, it is the animals that are being referred to and are the primary objects of interest. 2. \\"wearing\\" - This word indicates an action or state of the sheep. It describes what the sheep are doing or what condition they are in. The use of \\"wearing\\" helps paint a visual image of the sheep and provides more information about them, making it essential for understanding the sentence. 3. \\"bells\\" - The word \\"bells\\" is another important element in the sentence. It is the object that the sheep are wearing. Bells are typically small, hollow, and metallic instruments that produce a ringing sound when struck. In this case, their presence on the sheep suggests that the animals might be part of a larger group, a herd, or might be domesticated for some purpose. 4. \\"around their necks\\" - This phrase provides additional context for the placement of the bells. By specifying that the bells are \\"around their necks,\\" we gain a clearer understanding of how the sheep are wearing the bells. This phrase helps construct the mental image of the sheep and is important for comprehending the full context of how the bells are situated on the animals. 5. \\"Some\\" - Though it is not as important as the other words, \\"some\\" serves a contextual purpose in the sentence. It indicates that the description applies to an unspecified number of sheep within a larger group. This word could imply that not all sheep in a group are wearing bells or that the description applies to only a select few sheep. In summary, the most important words in the sentence \\"Some sheep that are wearing bells around their necks\\" are \\"sheep,\\" \\"wearing,\\" \\"bells,\\" and \\"around their necks.\\" Each one of these words and phrases contributes crucial information that helps to understand the main subject, the implied action, related objects, and context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Tom also wondered: could we be one of God's dreams? Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. The premise and the hypothesis are essentially expressing the same idea in slightly different ways. To understand this, we need to unpack the two statements. The premise: \\"And (as Tom wonders in the book's opening line) are we all characters in one of God's dreams?\\" This statement tells us that Tom, a character in the book is pondering on a metaphysical question. He is contemplating whether all beings, or all of humanity, could potentially be characters in a dream conjured up by God. Here, “God’s dreams” could be interpreted to mean a metaphysical plane, a divine plan, or the manifestation of God’s will or imagination. Essentially, Tom in this context is questioning the nature of existence and whether our reality is part of a much larger, divine construct, something akin to a dream of God. The hypothesis: \\"Tom also wondered: could we be one of God's dreams?\\" In this statement, Tom is once again positing the same existential notion. He is asking if our existence, our reality, and indeed humanity itself could potentially exist within a dream of God's. Here, the term \\"God's dreams\\" is once again open to interpretation and could be interpreted to mean a realm outside our understanding, a divine blueprint or simply an aspect of divine imagination or will. In both cases, Tom is contemplating the same central theory: the possibility of our existence and reality being part of a spiritual or divine design that is beyond our comprehension, perhaps similar to characters within a dream. In conclusion, given that the two queries maintain the same existential question pertaining to the nature of our reality and its relation to a greater divine plan or construct, we can assuredly say that the premise does entail the hypothesis. Both propose the idea that we could be living within one of God's dreams. On dissecting each statement, it's evident that they point to the same philosophical inquiry, therefore showing that the premise does indeed entail the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Two coworkers are sitting in the large break room eating lunch and watching the news on TV when they see an advertisement for glasses. John, upon seeing the ad, comments that he really should go and get a new pair since he is nearsighted and hasn't gotten a new pair of glasses in a couple years. Rick says he is glad that he doesn't need to wear glasses because it seems like such a pain to have to always have something on your face. John nods in agreement and then both men turn to see a woman at the other side of the break room waving at them and trying to get their attention. Which person's parents are less likely to wear glasses? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Rick's parents are less likely to wear glasses. Rick mentioned that he doesn't need to wear glasses, suggesting he may not have inherited the genetic predisposition for nearsightedness from his parents. Conversely, John is nearsighted, which can be inherited, indicating there's a higher chance that one or both of his parents wear glasses. However, it's essential to note that the absence of definitive information about their parents' vision and other possible causes for vision problems make it impossible to draw a conclusive answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: I teach geography at UNLV three times per week. Last Monday, at the beginning of class, I cheerfully asked my students how their weekend had been. One young man said that his weekend had not been so good. He had his wisdom teeth removed. The young man then asked me why I always seemed to be so cheerful. \\"I choose to be cheerful.\\" I said. Then I told them a story. In addition to teaching here at UNLV, I also teach out at the community college in Henderson, 17 miles down the freeway from where I live. One day I drove those 17 miles to Henderson. I exited the freeway and turned onto College Drive. I only had to drive another quarter mile down the road to the college. But just then my car died and wouldn't start again. So I left my car there and marched down the road to the college. As soon as I got there I called AAA and arranged for a tow truck to meet me at my car after class. The secretary in the office asked me what had happened. \\"This is my lucky day.\\" I replied, smiling. \\"Your car breaks down and today is your lucky day?\\" She was puzzled. \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"My car could have broken down anywhere along the freeway but it didn't.\\" I replied, \\"Instead, it broke down in the perfect place: off the freeway, within walking distance from here. I'm still able to teach my class, and I've been able to arrange for the tow truck to meet me after class.\\" The secretary's eyes opened wide, and then she smiled. I smiled back and headed for class. So ended my story. I scanned the sixty faces in my class at UNLV. Despite the early hour, no one seemed to be asleep. Somehow, my story had touched them. Or maybe _ In fact, it had all started with a student's observation that I was cheerful. An Indian wise man once said, \\"Who you are speaks louder to me than anything you can say.\\" I suppose it must be so. Question: By saying \\"it wasn't the story at all\\", the author means that _ . Options: A: His story is not convincing B: He shouldn't have told the story C: His attitude to life has inspired the students D: His story is not as interesting as expected The answer is:","completion":"C: His attitude to life has inspired the students Step-by-step justification: 1. The author shares a personal story about choosing to be cheerful and finding luck even in an unfortunate situation, like their car breaking down. 2. The student's comment was about the author's cheerfulness, showing their awareness of the author's attitude. 3. In the quote \\"Who you are speaks louder to me than anything you can say\\", it suggests that actions and attitudes can have a stronger impact than words alone. 4. Given the context of the story and the focus on the author's attitude, option C fits best as it refers to the author's attitude inspiring the students, instead of placing importance on the story itself."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts. Question: \\"How did the Moors change Portugal?\\" Response: \\"The Moors influence can be seen in their contribution of wells, waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the local people and the introduction of Islam as a religion\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct based on the information provided in the paragraph.

That's as scary as it gets for the Cincinnati Bengals. The Bengals inched closer to what would be an ongoing franchise-record fourth consecutive postseason berth in Week 15 when plenty of money signs were flashed but none coming from the player most associated with the overbearing gesture, Johnny Manziel. The Cleveland rookie quarterback's first career NFL start was as dismal as it gets and the Browns were whitewashed, 30-0, by the AFC North-leading Bengals. But if Jim Ross was getting ready to broadcast the Bengals' next game, the famed wrestling announcer might say: \\"Business is about to pick up.\\" Cincinnati can clinch the playoff spot with a win over the AFC West champion Denver Broncos on Monday night, and it can earn the AFC North crown with a win coupled with losses by the Steelers, who play Kansas City on Sunday, and the Ravens, who are at Houston. \\"We're still in control of everything,\\" said Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton. \\"We know these next two games are going to be big. The way our division is going, everyone keeps winning. We know what we're facing.\\" What their facing is the Boogeyman on \\"Monday Night Football,\\" along with the stark realization that Manziel will be turning into Manning over a one-week span. That's the equivalent of a basic arithmetic test followed up by one on advanced calculus. \\"It's going to be a big shift, safe to say,\\" Cincinnati coach Marvin Lewis admitted. \\"It's a challenge. (Manning) gets everyone's attention in this building right away. The player he is, how he carries himself, how he runs things on the field -- it's going to be a great challenge for us.\\" Challenge may be an under statement because the Bengals have never beaten Manning whether he was in Indianapolis or Denver, compiling an 0-8 mark when the five-time MVP is lined up opposite them. If that wasn't daunting enough, the game is also going to be played after sundown and that's never a good thing for Cincinnati. The Bengals have played twice in primetime so far this season, getting blown out both times, a 43-17 setback at New England in a Sunday night game on Oct. 5, and a 24-3 drubbing at the hands of the Browns while Brian Hoyer was still in charge on Thursday, Nov. 6. Since Dalton took over the Bengals in the 2011 season Cincinnati is playing .250 football (2-6) under the national spotlight, a sharp contrast from its 37-16-1 mark over that same span during day games. \\"I have no idea,\\" defensive end Wallace Gilberry said when asked about the team's struggles at night. \\"I guess we're afraid of the dark.\\" Add in the three playoff losses since 2011 and the Bengals are a downright dismal 2-9 when the spotlight is focused squarely on them and Lewis' team is tired of hearing about it. \\"It is annoying and it's our job to make it unannoying,\\" safety George Iloka said. \\"If we lose this game, the talk will come back again. But that's (the media's) job to do. And if we want to silence the critics, we've got to put up or shut up. That's how it goes. It might be annoying, but that's on us.\\" Silencing anyone on Monday is going to be a daunting task. Manning and the Broncos' offense have taken a step back from their historical 2013 performance, perhaps the best statistical season in NFL history. That said, when you look up, the numbers remain staggering as Manning is third in the AFC with 4,143 passing yards and even better with 37 TD passes (second in the NFL) and a 106.4 passer rating (tops in the conference). The veteran now has an NFL record 14 career 4,000-yard passing seasons and headlines an offense that is fifth in the NFL in both yards (400.7 yards per game) and points per game (29.1). If anything the group has become more well-rounded in recent weeks because of the emergence of the ground game and C.J. Anderson, who is averaging 135.3 scrimmage yards per game (812 total) with six total TDs (four rushing, two receiving) over the past six games. The receiving threats, meanwhile, remain as good as any in football led by Demaryius Thomas, who has 1,389 receiving yards and leads all AFC receivers with 41 TD catches since entering the league in 2010. His running mate, Emmanuel Sanders, has a career-high 1,261 yards and seven TD catches over his past nine games. The Cincinnati defense looked like world-beaters against Manziel but has taken a significant step back overall without Mike Zimmer, now the head coach in Minnesota. The Bengals D entered last week's contest 25th in the league and are now 20th after dominating Manziel. The 25 number is probably more indicative of where Cincinnati belongs because facing a QB who isn't ready to play in the NFL is an anomaly and certainly not what the Bengals will be up against on Monday night. \\"We have to get through this game before we have any opportunities at January,\\" Lewis said. \\"It's been (a playoff mentality) for the last seven weeks. Preparation and how you go about it, and the confidence of knowing what to do and how to do it allows you to play fast. That's the most important thing, for us: to play fast, to play physical, to play smart.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The Cincinnati Bengals are preparing to face the Denver Broncos in a game that could secure their place in the playoffs, but they must overcome their struggles in primetime games and face the challenge of Peyton Manning and the Broncos' high-powered offense.

As you may have gathered from the title, I wholeheartedly believe this movie to be the worst zombie movie of all time. The acting, camera-work, writing, special effects and anything else remotely related to this movie sucked. People have argued that while this movie is terribly-acted and terribly-produced but it comes through with a witty intelligent script. Wow. The plot has more holes than I or anyone else could possibly count. For starters, why would the government tell everyone to go back to work when it's not safe? I know the government's supposed to be evil but they don't gain anything by killing the entire population of the country. There wouldn't be anyone to govern! Another thing that I was wondering about, even if the government told everyone to go to work, why would people go if the streets were swarming with zombies? Were the zombies going to hide in the bushes and ambush the unsuspecting people in order to aid the government in their plot to kill everyone on the planet? And how about the ending? That stupid Torch guy sacrifices his life in order to get a few close up shots of the zombies. He probably forgot that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom feature. And another thing, why does he say Hindenburg before he dies. The Hindenburg was a rare event seen by a very few people. The zombie menace will been seen by everyone in the country, possibly the world. He doesn't think anyone else will get a few snapshots? They also managed to ruin the only semi-interesting scene in the film when the soldier is watching the exotic dancer. Why did the zombie hide behind a curtain for five minutes before attacking the girl? Especially when the zombie could have come through the DOOR. It's probably just something an unintelligent zombie movie fan such as myself wouldn't understand. Every day I pray that God with increase my brain capacity long enough for me to figure out all the subtle nuances in Feeding the Masses.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Instructions: In this task, you are given a tuple, comprising Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonY, or others, feel what is mentioned in the Tail or not. Feelings in this task are the emotional reactions on the part of PersonY or other participants in an event. For example, as a result of gift-giving, others (in this case, PersonY) might feel appreciated. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action. Input: Head: PersonX fights all the time<sep>Tail: disturbed.

Step 4: Determine if the Head event causes the Tail feeling Given that PersonX fights all the time, it's reasonable to assume that PersonY, or others, would feel disturbed due to the constant negative behavior. Step 5: Classify the answer Since the Head event (PersonX fighting all the time) likely causes the Tail feeling (disturbed), the answer is classified as \\"Yes.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Ice forms inside a cloud - Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges - The cloud becomes a thundercloud - Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge - Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud - This positive energy gathers on the ground - The positive energy connects with the negative energy and forms lightning. suppose there are more electrostatic charges formed happens, how will it affect a thundercloud will be larger. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer to this question is:","completion":"Directly impacting a step of the process. In the process outlined, the formation and buildup of electrostatic charges play a critical role in the development of a thundercloud and subsequent lightning. When there is a greater number of electrostatic charges produced inside a cloud, it will have a direct impact on the process: 1. Increase in ice particles inside the cloud: As more ice forms inside a cloud, it provides a greater number of particles for the collision and bumping process. These collisions result in the generation of electrostatic charges. 2. Enhanced electrostatic charging: More collisions of ice particles would cause a greater number of electrostatic charges to be generated. As a result, the cloud would acquire a more potent negative charge, leading to a stronger polarization of charges within the thundercloud. 3. Intensification of the thundercloud: The stronger electrostatic energy contributes to the development of a larger, more intense thundercloud. This, in turn, could lead to more powerful thunderstorms, producing more frequent and potentially more dangerous lightning. 4. Increased attraction of positive energy: With the enhanced negative charge in the cloud, the positive energy on the ground would be more strongly attracted to it, leading to a greater concentration of positive charges on the ground as they attempt to connect with the negative charges in the cloud. 5. Greater potential for lightning: The stronger connection between positive and negative energy would result in a higher likelihood of lightning formation. Furthermore, this lightning could exhibit more powerful effects due to the increased energy buildup within the cloud and ground. In conclusion, the increase in electrostatic charges within a cloud would directly impact the process of thundercloud and lightning formation. This impact would lead to more intense thunderclouds and potentially more dangerous and frequent lightning occurrences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Und zugegeben: Die Beschreibung des Inhalts hört sich sogar vielversprechend an. Ich habe einen Thriller erwartet, der voll von herrlichem schwarzen Humor ist und wurde mit dieser Erwartung vor allem durch Thea Dorns Erzählstil bitter enttäuscht. Ihre Art zu schreiben erinnert mich an meine Versuche als Autorin...im Alter von 12 Jahren. Thea Dorn versucht starke und außergewöhnliche Charaktere zu kreieren. Dies gelingt ihr jedoch nicht im entferntesten. Die Personen allen voran die Hauptperson sind langweilig und einseitig. Thea Dorn wollte keine Karrikaturen in ihrem Roman und das ist ihr Pech. So wirken ihre Figuren weder aussagekräftig noch humorvoll, sondern trotzen nur so vor Einseitigkeit. \\"Berliner Aufklärung\\" ist in keinem Fall erfehlenswert.

The characters, above all the main character, are boring and one-dimensional. Thea Dorn didn't want caricatures in her novel which is her bad luck.

Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Bacteria"},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: After a long and winding argument over the topic, Lee left Austin's house.

Maggie Smith previously said she thinks there’s not enough plot to continue the show. (Nick Briggs) A follow-up movie to wrap up storylines has been the subject of rumors since the show’s finale. Dockery, who played Lady Mary, teased the possibility in August. “I think there is potential for a film. That is something I would wholeheartedly consider, so we will see,” she told The Telegraph. “It may not be over yet.” 'Downton Abbey' finale scores major ratings win for PBS Fellowes offered a similar endorsement. The movie could begin filming as early as September. “There is an audience for a film. I’d structure a narrative with lots of things happening, but we would need a kind of unity to make a feature, which is a challenge for me,” he told Indie Wire last May. “It would be a bigger canvas: a riot could be a real riot, the ball a real ball. I would like that, I think it would be fun.” Smith, however, doesn’t sound like she’s on board. “I just think it’s squeezing it dry, do you know what I mean?

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose body was flown to Adelaide?, using the article: By 1957 Grainger's physical health had markedly declined, as had his powers of concentration. Nevertheless, he continued to visit Britain regularly; in May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC \\"Concert Hour\\" programme when he played \\"Handel in the Strand\\" on the piano. Back home, after further surgery he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\". This wish was not carried out.Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital went well, but his conducting in the afternoon was, in his own words, \\"a fiasco\\". Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott's early songs. His last letters, written from hospital in December 1960 and January 1961, record attempts to work, despite failing eyesight and hallucinations: \\"I have been trying to write score for several days. But I have not succeeded yet.\\"Grainger died in the White Plains hospital on 20 February 1961, at the age of 78. His body was flown to Adelaide where, on 2 March, he was buried in the Aldridge family vault in the West Terrace Cemetery, alongside Rose's ashes.

He was born into a talented family, with his father being the famous actor and director Jose Ferrer, and his mother being the singer and actress Rosemary Clooney, making him a cousin to the well-known actor George Clooney. Throughout his career, Ferrer appeared in numerous film and television projects, such as his roles in the cult classic sci-fi film RoboCop (1987) as Bob Morton, the crime drama series Twin Peaks (1990-1991) as the forensic pathologist Albert Rosenfield, and the television series NCIS: Los Angeles (2012-2017) as Assistant Director Owen Granger. In addition to his live-action work, Ferrer lent his distinct voice to multiple animated projects. Some notable examples include the villainous Shan Yu in Disney's Mulan (1998), the antagonistic Vice President Rodriguez in the animated series The Batman (2004-2008), and the Silvermane character in The Spectacular Spider-Man (2008-2009). His voice acting work showcased his range and ability to adapt to various roles, from menacing and sinister characters to more complex, emotionally driven parts. Miguel Ferrer's portrayal of Death in Adventure Time's Death in Bloom episode added depth and charisma to the character, demonstrating his proficiency in voice acting. Despite his unfortunate passing in 2017, Ferrer's legacy continues to live on through the memorable characters he brought to life on both the big and small screen."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. When Maria Elza de Fatima learned the World Cup was coming to Brazil in 2014, she thought the good times were soon to return. Once the owner of a busy clothing stall, the 59-year-old Sao Paulo resident had scraped around for work since her license expired and wasn't renewed by city authorities. But now the World Cup was coming to her home town -- along with many thousands of fans, visitors and tourists -- opportunities would abound, wouldn't they? It hasn't quite turned out that way. De Fatima may be one of the lucky ones who has been able to secure an official World Cup job but what she can do and where she can work is limited. Alongside roughly 600 others, she has been given permission to sell ice packs and soft drinks outside the Sao Paulo stadium. Only official FIFA partners are allowed to hock their wares here and within the arena. De Fatima is all too aware that many others haven't been so fortunate. She recalls the days when as many 22,000 stall-owners plied their trade on Sao Paulo's streets. A mere 600 jobs (although there are also temporary roles in other areas) isn't nearly enough for them, she laments. \\"This World Cup is not for the Brazilians,\\" de Fatima replies when asked whether Sao Paulo has experienced the boon she expected. \\"It is for the foreigners and FIFA friends.\\" Nationwide protests. De Fatima isn't the only disillusioned Brazilian. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that 61% of respondents felt hosting the World Cup would be a bad thing for their country. According to Marina Mattar of the Sao Paulo Popular Committee of the World Cup, an umbrella organization for disparate protest groups in the city, the tournament will bring a lot of money into Brazil, but mainly to a well-connected few. \\"The World Cup is bringing benefits to Brazil but it's to the economic and political elites -- not to street vendors, not to small companies, entrepreneurs and not to workers in general,\\" she said. Key to this debate are the spiraling costs of building new stadia across the country to host matches during the World Cup. Promotional literature released by the Brazilian government puts expenditure in terms of funds, loans and credit lines from the public purse for stadium projects at at 3.5 billion. But a recent audit suggests the price has escalated to 4.2 billion. \\"The stadiums are not being built for ordinary people because the price of the tickets is very high and many people will not be able to go watch football any more. \\"Instead, the stadiums are in a way very good for big engineering companies to make money,\\" Mattar said. People have also been evicted from their homes to make way for projects relating to the World Cup and there has been the \\"pacification\\" of favelas, which has seen police forcibly occupy some of the poorer neighborhoods in the city, she added. Such concerns are far from exclusive to Sao Paulo. All across Brazil, street protests have raged in the last year while popular committee groups have also sprung up in Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and beyond. A multitude of grievances, not all directly related to the world Cup, have driven this discontent -- including rising transport prices, higher living costs, housing concerns and accusations of police brutality. Fairness and equality are at the heart of these concerns. While Brazil has grown rapidly since the turn of the century, creating a new middle class, inequality remains high and some fear the very poorest are being left behind. According to the CIA World Factbook, Brazil ranks 17th out of 140 countries in terms of the highest levels of income disparity. Protesters are asking why an emerging nation is spending billions on hosting a football tournament when that money could be better directed towards alleviating poverty. \\"It is unacceptable to build a mega event that will provide high profits to FIFA ... while there are serious problems of social inequality in the country,\\" said Jean Marcelo, an activist with the student protest group Domino Publico. \\"The World Cup reaffirms an existing logic that rules the Brazilian government. It's a logic benefiting big businesses and a small elite who occupy the top of the social pyramid,\\" he added. But with new roads, airports and stadiums being built, all of which have brought jobs and improvements to the country's infrastructure, there are many who say the initial outlay, however eye-watering, will be worth it in the long term. The Brazilian government estimates that 710,000 temporary and permanent jobs will be created during the tournament while fan spending alone is expected to total 13 billion. On top of that, many Brazilian cities see the exposure they will gain hosting matches as an opportunity to position themselves as attractive destinations to potential investors and tourists now and in the future. A World Cup for all? \\"There has been significant investment in urban mobility projects, in airport modernization projects, in port modernization projects, telecommunications infrastructure and security infrastructure,\\" Brazil's deputy sports minister Luis Fernandes told CNN. \\"You have to remember that Brazil is still a developing nation... as well as providing jobs for hundreds of thousands of Brazilians, these investments will benefit people in terms of the services provided,\\" he added. \\"The fans who come to the World Cup won't be taking back with them the new urban transport solutions or airport extensions,\\" Fernandes said. Paulo Esteves, general supervisor at Rio de Janeiro-based think-tank, the BRICS Policy Center, agrees with this viewpoint. \\"In a way, what we are seeing are investments that otherwise do not take place,\\" he said. \\"The World Cup has been a kind of catalyst for this.\\" \\"The government did not take money from health or transportation to invest in stadiums. Investments in public health and transportation will go on and on.\\" Esteves is quick to add, however, that this doesn't mean public grievances are without merit, and believes the World Cup has created a platform for groups and people dissatisfied with how Brazil is developing as to unite and make their voices heard. In recent weeks teachers, metro workers and bus drivers have gone on strike demanding better pay and conditions. Others have taken to the streets to campaign for better housing. Rather than highlighting the negatives of hosting a football tournament, these protests \\"are really talking about the other side of economic modernization in Brazil,\\" Esteves said. \\"The World Cup is not a target per se but it is an opportunity to vocalize and make stronger ... claims for strengthening the process around political and social inclusion.\\" However, Mattar and others in protest movements maintain their opposition to the World Cup is based on principled rejection of spending decisions tied to what they regard as an elitist, closed event. Yet, with billions of dollars already spent and the tournament about to start, they are realistic about what opposition can now achieve. Still, Mattar hopes the anger felt by many Brazilians will reach the watching world and provide lessons for future hosts of big sporting events, including the next two World Cup host countries. \\"We hope our legacy will be to show to people in Russia, Qatar and maybe in other places that these events and the way they are organized (make it) impossible they will bring any benefits,\\" Mattar said.

Answer:","completion":"If a weaker coffee filter is used, it may affect the process of making more coffee both directly and indirectly. Direct effect: The weaker filter could potentially tear or break due to the weight or pressure of the coffee grounds, causing the grounds to mix with the water and yielding a lower quality coffee. In such cases, the coffee-making process might need to be repeated, which will affect the overall quantity and speed of coffee production. Indirect effect: A weaker filter might not hold the coffee grounds as effectively as a stronger one, leading to some grounds escaping into the brewed coffee. As a result, coffee produced could be slightly more bitter or have an inconsistent taste. This may cause dissatisfaction to the consumer, and they might request another cup of coffee made with a better filter, thus affecting the overall quantity of coffee being made.

Step 2: Calculate the possible outcomes There are a total of 6 faces on each die, so when throwing two dice, we have 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. Step 3: Determine the totals List all the possible combinations and their respective totals when throwing two dice: (1,1) = 2 (1,2) = 3 (1,3) = 4 (1,4) = 5 (1,5) = 6 (1,6) = 7 (2,1) = 3 (2,2) = 4 (2,3) = 5 (2,4) = 6 (2,5) = 7 (2,6) = 8 (3,1) = 4 (3,2) = 5 (3,3) = 6 (3,4) = 7 (3,5) = 8 (3,6) = 9 (4,1) = 5 (4,2) = 6 (4,3) = 7 (4,4) = 8 (4,5) = 9 (4,6) = 10 (5,1) = 6 (5,2) = 7 (5,3) = 8 (5,4) = 9 (5,5) = 10 (5,6) = 11 (6,1) = 7 (6,2) = 8 (6,3) = 9 (6,4) = 10 (6,5) = 11 (6,6) = 12 Step 4: Count the occurrences of the totals Now, we count the number of times each total appears: Total: Frequency: 2 1 3 2 4 3 5 4 6 5 7 6 8 5 9 4 10 3 11 2 12 1 Step 5: Identify the most likely total From the frequency count, the most likely total is the one with the highest number of occurrences.

Science/Tech;","completion":"This topic is related to (c). Business. The statement by US Treasury Secretary John Snow regarding his support for a \\"strong dollar\\" refers to a belief in allowing market forces to determine the value of the US dollar, as well as advocating for a strong currency value when considering US economic policy. Discussing the matter in Dublin during his tour of Europe, his perspective on the topic has implications for global financial markets and international economic relations. The value of a currency is primarily determined by market supply and demand, which in turn are influenced by various factors, such as interest rates, economic indicators, and political events. Adhering to a policy of allowing market forces to determine the value of the dollar is an approach often adopted by governments that prefer not to actively intervene in currency markets. This can provide a more transparent and competitive environment for international trade and investment. A strong dollar policy, on the other hand, involves advocating for a healthy, stable, and robust value for the US currency. A strong dollar can have numerous economic benefits, such as encouraging foreign investment, reducing inflationary pressures, and promoting global confidence in the US economy. However, it can also have negative effects, such as making US exports more expensive and less competitive in international markets. One reason for John Snow's adherence to a strong dollar policy can be linked to his desire to position the US as a stable global economic power that inspires investor confidence. By supporting a strong dollar, he is signaling the US government's commitment to maintaining a healthy, sustainable, and growth-oriented economy. At the same time, Snow's belief in allowing market forces to determine the value of the dollar helps to demonstrate his confidence in the efficiency and wisdom of financial markets. Free market principles and the concept of laissez-faire, or non-interventionism by governments, are often viewed as central planks in modern economic liberalism. However, this reliance on market forces also has its critics. Some argue that, in times of economic turmoil or uncertainty, government intervention may be necessary to stabilize and protect the national currency from speculative attacks that may negatively impact the real economy. In summary, US Treasury Secretary John Snow's comments in Dublin support both a \\"strong dollar\\" policy and allowing market forces to guide the value of the US dollar.

The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air. Question: \\"What are two ways in which the body cools down?\\" Answer: \\"Sweat glands and blood vessels\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, this answer is correct.

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was born in 1947 in Imam Sahib District of the Kunduz province, northern Afghanistan, a member of the Kharoti tribe of the Ghilji Pashtun. His father, Ghulam Qader, who migrated to Kunduz, is originally from the center of Ghazni province. Afghan businessman and Kharoti tribal leader Gholam Serwar Nasher deemed Hekmatyar to be a bright young man and sent him to the Mahtab Qala military academy in 1968, but he was expelled due to his political views two years later. From 1970 to 1972, Hekmatyar attended Kabul University's engineering department. A highly controversial commander, Hekmatyar has been dubbed the \\"Butcher of Kabul\\", accused of being responsible for the destruction and civilian deaths Kabul experienced in the early 1990s. According to the U.S. Special Envoy to Afghanistan in 1989-1992, Peter Tomsen, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was hired in 1990 by the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to conquer and rule Afghanistan in the benefit of Pakistani interests, which plan was delayed until 1992 due to US pressure to cancel that plan. In April 1992, as the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan began to collapse, government officials joined the mujahideen, choosing different parties according to their ethnic and political affinities. For the most part, the members of the khalq faction of the PDPA, who were predominantly Pashtuns, joined with Hekmatyar. With their help, he began on 24 April to infiltrate troops into Kabul, and announced that he had seized the city, and that should any other leaders try to fly into Kabul, he would shoot their plane down. The new leader of the \\"Islamic Interim Government of Afghanistan\\", Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, appointed Ahmad Shah Massoud as defense minister, and urged him to take action. This he did, taking the offensive on 25 April, and after two days heavy fighting, the Hezb-i Islami and its allies were expelled from Kabul. A peace agreement was signed with Massoud on 25 May 1992, which made Hekmatyar Prime Minister. However, the agreement fell apart when he was blamed for a rocket attack on President Mojaddedi's plane. The following day, fighting resumed between Burhanuddin Rabbani's and Ahmed Shah Massoud's Jamiat, Abdul Rashid Dostum's Jumbish forces and Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami forces. From 1992 to 1996, the warring factions destroyed most of Kabul and killed thousands of people, most of them civilians, during the Afghan civil war. All the different parties participated in the destruction, but Hekmatyar's group was responsible for most of the damage, because of his practice of deliberately targeting civilian areas. Hekmatyar is thought to have bombarded Kabul in retaliation for what he considered its inhabitants' collaboration with the Soviets, and out of religious conviction. He once told a New York Times journalist that Afghanistan \\"already had one and a half million martyrs. We are ready to offer as many to establish a true Islamic Republic.\\" His attacks also had a political objective: to undermine the Rabbani government by proving that Rabbani and Massoud were unable to protect the population. In 1994 Hekmatyar would shift alliances, joining with Dostum as well as Hizb-e-Wahdat, a Hazara Shi'a party, to form the Shura-i Hamahangi (\\"Council of coordination\\"). Together they laid Siege of Kabul, unleashing massive barrages of artillery and rockets that led to the evacuation of U.N. personnel from Kabul, and caused several government members to abandon their posts. However the new alliance did not spell victory for Hekmatyar, and in June 1994, Massoud had driven Dostum's troops from the capital. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What roles did the different parties play?","completion":"Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was a man from Afghanistan who was born a long time ago in 1947. He became the leader of a group called Hezb-i Islami. Hekmatyar and his group were involved in a big fight with other groups in Afghanistan during the 1990s. This big fight was called the Afghan civil war. In this fight, different groups had different roles. Hekmatyar's group, Hezb-i Islami, was responsible for a lot of destruction in the city of Kabul. They would attack places where people lived, making life very hard for the people there. Hekmatyar wanted to show that the other leaders, like Rabbani and Massoud, couldn't protect the people. Other groups in the fight were Rabbani's and Massoud's Jamiat, Dostum's Jumbish, and a group called Hizb-e-Wahdat. They all fought against each other, trying to gain control of Afghanistan. At some point, Hekmatyar even joined forces with Dostum and Hizb-e-Wahdat, but they still didn't win. Massoud and his group managed to push them out of Kabul. So, the different parties in the Afghan civil war each had their roles and fought against each other to try and take control of the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers.

This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The first aircraft to use the ski jump ramp was the British Aerospace Sea Harrier. It is a STOVL (Short Take Off and Vertical Landing) aircraft that was initially operated by the Royal Navy. The ski jump ramp was developed to assist STOVL aircraft like the Sea Harrier to take off at much higher weights than possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. The concept of the ski jump ramp was introduced and tested by the Royal Navy in the late 1970s, with the first successful trials taking place on the HMS Invincible in 1977. The ramps quickly became standard features on British Invincible-class aircraft carriers, and since then, have been adopted by many other navies for their smaller carriers to enhance the capabilities of STOVL aircraft.

When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus. As they question him, Grishin appears, arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev is later killed by Dorganosov while in custody.

The Brain, a gangster with multiple girlfriends, is accompanied by a gambler named Regret (after the only horse he ever placed a winning bet) and an outsider who (with his bloodhounds) is being treated to a meal. Feet Samuels (so named because of his big feet) is in love with a showgirl named Hortense Hathaway, who is tossed out of the diner because of an unsavory reputation. Feet plans to have one wild night before committing suicide, having sold his body in advance to a medical doctor. Harriet MacKyle, a sheltered but friendly socialite, makes arrangements with a smooth-talking fixer for a big party that night at her estate, where many of the players will later attend. She has an interest in the exciting but dangerous criminal element. A girl selling flowers comes in after Feet makes a full payment of a debt to the Brain, so the Brain offers 5 for a 5-cent flower, telling her to keep the change. But before he can leave, a hitman for the Brooklyn Mob stabs him. The wounded Brain tells his men to take him \\"home.\\" Unfortunately, his many girlfriends refuse to allow him in for various reasons. Feet gets involved in a high-stakes craps game.

Article: More and more people are trying to learn English than any other language in the world. English is the world language of politics and international business. It becomes the international language of science, medicine, sports, travel and so on. In most schools in Asia, English is taught as the main foreign language. School children in China and Japan begin to learn English at an early age. English is the official language of more than seventy-five countries including Britain, Canada, the United States and Australia. Many different languages are spoken in some countries. However, English is often used as an official language to help people communicate with each other. India is a good example. English is the common language in this country, but at least twenty-four languages are spoken there. Do you know the history of English? Old English took many words from the French language. Most English words came from French, especially those words used for describing the law and the government, such as \\"damage\\",\\" prison \\"and \\" marriage\\". Then, English became what language experts called Middle English. The history of English continues as Middle English, and then it becomes Modern English, and it is spoken today. ,.

Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Q: In visual planning (VP), an agent learns to plan goal-directed behavior from observations of a dynamical system obtained offline, e.g., images obtained from self-supervised robot interaction. VP algorithms essentially combine data-driven perception and planning, and are important for robotic manipulation and navigation domains, among others. A recent and promising approach to VP is the semi-parametric topological memory (SPTM) method, where image samples are treated as nodes in a graph, and the connectivity in the graph is learned using deep image classification. Thus, the learned graph represents the topological connectivity of the data, and planning can be performed using conventional graph search methods. However, training SPTM necessitates a suitable loss function for the connectivity classifier, which requires non-trivial manual tuning. More importantly, SPTM is constricted in its ability to generalize to changes in the domain, as its graph is constructed from direct observations and thus requires collecting new samples for planning. In this paper, we propose Hallucinative Topological Memory (HTM), which overcomes these shortcomings. In HTM, instead of training a discriminative classifier we train an energy function using contrastive predictive coding. In addition, we learn a conditional VAE model that generates samples given a context image of the domain, and use these hallucinated samples for building the connectivity graph, allowing for zero-shot generalization to domain changes. In simulated domains, HTM outperforms conventional SPTM and visual foresight methods in terms of both plan quality and success in long-horizon planning. A:","completion":"Hallucinative Topological Memory (HTM) improves visual planning by using an energy function and a conditional VAE model to generate samples for building the connectivity graph, enabling zero-shot generalization and better performance in long-horizon planning."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the word \\"direction\\" used in the same way in the following two sentences? Keep going in the same direction. He had no direction in his life.","completion":"While the word \\"direction\\" is used in both sentences, it carries different meanings and connotations in each context. 1. In the first sentence, \\"Keep going in the same direction,\\" the word \\"direction\\" refers to a physical or geographical orientation –typically indicating the path or course that a person or object should follow to reach a specific destination or goal. This usage of \\"direction\\" is quite literal, and it likely pertains to navigation or spatial movement. In this context, \\"direction\\" may be further specified using cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) or instructions for turning (left, right, straight ahead). 2. In the second sentence, \\"He had no direction in his life,\\" the word \\"direction\\" is used in a figurative and more abstract manner. Here, it signifies purpose, motivation, or a clear sense of one's goals and aspirations. When someone is said to have \\"no direction\\" in their life, it indicates that they are aimless or uncertain about what they want to achieve in the future; they may be drifting through life without a clear plan or not making progress toward a fulfilling vocation or accomplishment. This use of \\"direction\\" is more metaphorical and conveys a state of being or mindset, rather than a physical or locational attribute. In conclusion, while the word \\"direction\\" appears in both sentences, its meaning and usage vary significantly based on the context. In the first sentence, \\"direction\\" pertains to a concrete, spatial interpretation, whereas, in the second sentence, it denotes an abstract, psychological concept. As such, \\"direction\\" is not used in the same way in these two sentences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Will increasing the pressure cause the expected volume be more or less? Marcus is working with a sealed container of oxygen. He is trying see how temperature effects its deviations from ideality. He slowly increases the temperature of the oxygen and continues to measures its deviations. Hint: The Figure below shows a graph of plotted against pressure for 1 mol of a gas at three different temperatures - 200 K, 500 K, and 1000 K. An ideal gas would have a value of 1 for that ratio at all temperatures and pressures and the graph would simply be a horizontal line. As can be seen, deviations from an ideal gas occur. As the pressure begins to rise, the attractive forces cause the volume of the gas to be less than expected and the value of drops under 1. Continued pressure increase results in the volume of the particles to become significant and the value of rises to greater than 1. Notice, that the magnitude of the deviations from ideality is greatest for the gas at 200 K and least for the gas at 1000 K. Answer:","completion":"Increasing the pressure will initially cause the expected volume to be less, as the paragraph states that \\"as the pressure begins to rise, the attractive forces cause the volume of the gas to be less than expected and the value of drops under 1.\\" However, with continued pressure increase, the volume of the particles will become significant, causing the value of to rise to greater than 1, and the expected volume will be more than it would be for an ideal gas. It is also important to note that the deviations from ideality are greatest for the gas at 200 K and least for the gas at 1000 K."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: What style of commercial vehicle body, incorporating an enclosed box body extended over the cab, takes its name from the town in Bedfordshire where the Bedford commercial vehicle plant was located?","completion":"The style of commercial vehicle body you are referring to is known as the Luton body or Luton van. This particular style of vehicle is named after the town of Luton in Bedfordshire, England. Luton is synonymous with the commercial vehicle industry mainly because it was home to the Bedford commercial vehicle plant, which was operated by Vauxhall Motors. The plant produced various types of commercial vehicles, including the Luton-style van, which eventually took its name from the town. The Luton van features an enclosed box body that extends over the cab area, creating a distinctive \\"peak\\" known as the \\"Luton peak\\" or \\"kick.\\" This additional space above the cab is specifically designed to maximize the vehicle's storage capacity, making it a popular choice for various industries, particularly in the freight, removals, and logistics sectors. The Luton van format allows businesses to transport larger volumes of goods in a single trip, thereby improving efficiency and reducing overall transportation costs. Luton vans typically come in two distinct styles – the standard Luton van and the Luton box van. The main difference between the two lies in their construction and overall size. While both vans have the distinctive Luton peak, the standard Luton van is built by attaching the box body to a chassis cab, whereas the Luton box van is constructed using more rigid and robust materials, such as a GRP (Glass Reinforced Plastic) or fiberglass body, and often offers a greater overall volume for storage. Other key features of Luton vans include: 1. Versatility: Luton vans can be easily customized to suit various needs, with optional shelving, storage systems, and tail lifts tailored to fit the specific requirements of a business. 2. Weight capacities: These vans come in a range of sizes and weight capacities, typically spanning from 3.5 to 7.5 tonnes. This means that there is a Luton van suitable for various types of cargo and business demands across different industries. 3. Accessibility: Luton vans typically have large rear doors, often equipped with tail lifts or ramps, which makes loading and unloading heavy or bulky goods more manageable. 4. Internal height: The internal height of a Luton van is generally greater than that of a standard panel van, which makes it an ideal choice for transporting tall or bulky items. 5. Fuel efficiency: Thanks to their boxy design and lightweight construction materials, Luton vans are often more fuel-efficient than traditional panel vans. In summary, the Luton van is a popular type of commercial vehicle body, characterized by its enclosed box body extended over the cab area. This distinct design not only provides additional storage space but also offers numerous practical advantages for various industries. Originating from the town of Luton, Bedfordshire, which was home to the renowned Bedford commercial vehicle plant, the Luton van remains a symbol of the area's legacy and its contribution to the growth and development of the commercial vehicle industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is \\"He subsequently took back the annexed Caucasian territories which were divided among the Ottoman and Russian authorities by the ongoing chaos in Iran.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Yes, this statement is generally correct. Nader Shah was a prominent Persian ruler who ruled from 1736 to 1747. During his reign, he took back several territories that were annexed by the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire. To provide more detail, Nader Shah's rise to power came after a period of political instability in Iran, which was weakened and fractured by internal strife and external threats. The Safavid Empire had been diminished under the ineffective rule of Shah Sultan Husayn, who was eventually overthrown by an Afghan invasion in 1722. As a result, several nations took advantage of Persia's weakened state. The Ottoman Empire occupied western and northwestern regions of Persia, including significant historical provinces and cities, such as Azerbaijan, Kermanshah, and Hamadan. The Russian Empire, meanwhile, expanded its influence in the Caucuses and the Caspian Sea region during the Iran crisis of 1722–1723. The Treaty of Constantinople between the Ottoman Empire and Russia in 1724 resulted in further divisions of Persian lands between the two empires, with the Ottomans controlling the Caucasus region and Russia occupying the territories around the Caspian Sea. When Nader Shah seized power in 1736 after a series of military campaigns, he sought to restore Persian territories and pride. He began by retaking Azerbaijan from the Ottomans in 1735, a conquest that eventually led to the signing of the Treaty of Ganja with the recapture of Dagestan, eastern Georgia, and Armenia. This treaty, signed in 1735, confirmed Persia's control over these territories. Next, Nader Shah turned his attention to the Russian-controlled lands in the north. After unsuccessful diplomatic negotiations with the Russians, Nader Shah launched military campaigns against them in 1739. This resulted in the capture of important territories in the Caspian Sea region, such as Derbent, Rasht, and Baku. Finally, Nader Shah's Persian forces managed to reestablish control over the lost Persian territories. The Treaty of Resht, signed on January 21, 1732, and the Treaty of Ganja, signed on September 10, 1735, formalized the return of these territories to Persia from the Ottomans and Russians, respectively. These events marked a significant resurgence of Persian power under Nader Shah's rule and highlighted his efforts to reclaim Iran's rightful territories that had been lost during the country's chaotic and vulnerable periods."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1642, Güshi Khan, founder of the Khoshut Khanate, overthrew the prince of Tsang and made the 5th Dalai Lama the highest spiritual and political authority in Tibet, establishing the regime known as Ganden Phodrang. Tsewang Rabtan invaded Tibet in 1717, deposed the pretender to the position of Dalai Lama of Lha-bzang Khan, the last ruler of the Khoshut Khanate, and killed Lha-bzang Khan and his entire family. They also viciously destroyed a small force in the Battle of the Salween River which the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty had sent to clear traditional trade routes in 1718. In response, an expedition sent by Kangxi Emperor, together with Tibetan forces under Polhané Sönam Topgyé of Tsang and Kangchennas , the governor of Western Tibet, expelled the Dzungars from Tibet in 1720.

Negative: Title: \\"A Hazy Disappointment\\" A Hazy Disappointment began with much promise, boasting an alluring premise and star-studded cast. Regrettably, it failed to capitalize on its potential, resulting in a painfully unengaging and forgettable cinematic experience. The storyline revolves around a group of talented scientists who embark on a groundbreaking experiment to unlock the secrets of human memory. Unfortunately, the plot quickly unravels into a haphazard accumulation of poorly conceived subplots, leaving the audience with a general sense of confusion and disappointment. Contrived twists and underdeveloped characters plague the narrative, making it easy to question the intentions of the filmmakers. Speaking of characters, the talented actors are sorely underutilized. Their remarkable skills are obscured by shallow character development and implausible dialogue, making it impossible for the audience to establish any emotional connection with the protagonists. Moreover, their performances are encumbered by a lack of chemistry, further hindering the movie's overall appeal. Visually, A Hazy Disappointment is no saving grace either. While the creative concept of the film suggested a great potential for stunning visuals and intriguing cinematic moments, the final product does little to inspire awe or wonder. The cinematography is bland and uninspired, and the special effects range from passable to embarrassingly outdated. A glaring issue that defies the otherwise brilliant score is its thorough mismatch with what unfolds on screen. At times it can be more of a distraction rather than an enhancement to the story. The discordant audio makes a feeble attempt to invoke emotions that the narrative cannot cultivate, further amplifying the disappointment. In conclusion, A Hazy Disappointment squanders its intriguing concept and Academy Award-winning cast on a convoluted, ill-conceived narrative. A film that could have been a powerful exploration of themes such as memory, identity, and human connection, instead succumbs to clichéd tropes and superficial storytelling. Ultimately, A Hazy Disappointment joins the long list of forgettable films that leave viewers pondering what might have been if only the potential had been properly harnessed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This was when the territory of Northern Rhodesia was first administratively formed in 1911. The capital was then moved to Lusaka in 1935 due to its more central location. So, the first capital of Northern Rhodesia was Livingstone.

A:","completion":"After analyzing the given review, the chances of buying the product would likely decrease due to several concerns mentioned by the reviewer. Here is a detailed breakdown of the factors that contribute to this decreased likelihood: 1. Ineffective cooling capacity: The reviewer mentions that the product couldn't adequately cool an 11x12 room with high ceilings, even though it is stated to have a higher BTU rating compared to their window A/C unit that performs well under the same conditions. This indicates that the product may not be as efficient or effective as advertised, which could lead to unsatisfactory results in maintaining optimal room temperature. 2. Excessive noise from the fan: The loudness of the fan is another issue highlighted in the review. A noisy fan could be a significant disturbance, particularly in a residential setting where people value peace and quiet. This could create discomfort and possibly affect sleep and relaxation, making it an undesirable feature for a potential buyer. 3. Positive customer support experience: Despite the negative aspects of the product, the reviewer mentions that the customer support was great. While this is a benefit, it is important to note that it doesn't outweigh the product's performance issues. Ideally, customers shouldn't have to rely on customer support for a product that meets their expectations in the first place. 4.

Question: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

But a senior adviser has suggested that the door was being left open for a future review of its status.

The select committee had called for a message from ministers that the subject would be made compulsory. The education secretary said: \\"In the coming months I intend to look at all the options to ensure PSHE is taught well everywhere.\\" The subject teaches a wide range of topics related to keeping pupils safe and healthy, including issues such as: It is taught by most state schools, but it is not compulsory. The House of Commons Education Select Committee, in a report published before the general election, had warned of a \\"lack of clarity on the status of the subject\\". \\"This must change, and we accept the argument that statutory status is needed for PSHE, with sex and relationships education as a core part of it,\\" it said. The committee had said that the quality of lessons in the subject required improvement in 40% of schools - and that young people too often reported that the \\"sex and relationships education they receive is inadequate\\". \\"This situation would not be tolerated in other subjects,\\" said the committee's report. The education secretary's response emphasised the need to improve the standards of PSHE lessons, but did not indicate any decision to change its status. Mrs Morgan said PSHE and sex and relationships education were \\"essential to keeping pupils safe and healthy, inside and outside the school gates\\". \\"Young people today face unprecedented pressures posed by modern technology,\\" she said. \\"Good quality PSHE can provide them with the information they need to stay safe and build resilience against the risks of exploitation or radicalisation. \\"At its heart, good PSHE supports young people to make informed choices.\\" Education Select Committee chairman Mr Carmichael said the response was \\"disappointing\\". \\"Ministers entirely sidestep the call made by MPs in the closing months of the last Parliament to give statutory status to PSHE,\\" he said. \\"It is unclear why it should have taken the government so long to publish such a feeble response. \\"The inquiry found the government's strategy for improving PSHE and sex and relationships education in schools to be weak. \\"Yet there is nothing in this response to reassure Parliament - or young people - that the situation will now improve.\\" But the Family Education Trust has spoken out against the idea of PSHE being made compulsory, arguing it would weaken the sense of parents having prime responsibility for keeping their children safe and healthy. \\"The more that schools take responsibility to themselves for these areas, the less that parents will see them as their responsibility,\\" said director Norman Wells.

Negative Movie Review: Title: \\"Disenchanted Dreams\\" Disenchanted Dreams had the potential to be a captivating story exploring the role of reality and dreams, but it fell catastrophically short in execution. Despite the promising premise, the film suffered from glaring issues in pacing, character development, and special effects. Step 1: Address the pacing issues Firstly, the pacing of the movie was uneven and disjointed, which made it difficult for the audience to stay engaged in the narrative. Long stretches of the film were filled with slow, uneventful scenes that did little to propel the story. The transitions between events felt abrupt, and the climax arrived without any buildup, leaving the viewers underwhelmed and unsatisfied. Step 2: Discuss character development The lack of character development was another major drawback. The protagonist, played by renowned actor Dylan Farrington, appeared one-dimensional and failed to invoke any sympathy for his plight. The supporting characters were equally bland, their motivations and relationships with the protagonist poorly defined, which left the audience uninvested in their fates. Step 3: Comment on special effects Furthermore, the film's heavy reliance on special effects to create the dream worlds was a major misstep. The visuals were unconvincing, at times even laughable, and ultimately served as a distraction rather than an enhancement to the story. This was disappointing given the film's ambitious concept and the opportunities that it presented for creative visual storytelling. Step 4: Offer final thoughts In conclusion, Disenchanted Dreams squandered its intriguing premise with poor pacing, lackluster character development, and subpar special effects. What could have been a thought-provoking exploration of dreams and reality was marred by its execution, leaving the audience feeling disenchanted."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But in the town of Ayn Issa, barely 35 miles (56km) north of the front lines, they are already looking at a future post-caliphate. On Wednesday, Brett McGurk, the US envoy to the coalition fighting the group that calls itself Islamic State (IS), arrived at the headquarters of the Raqqa Civilian Council to meet local leaders-in-waiting. \\"There are tremendous challenges ahead,\\" he said. \\"The United States is committed to defeating Daesh [IS]. That's why we're here. And we want to make sure that what comes after Daesh is stable. \\"And if you look at the record to date, coalition-backed operations in Iraq and Syria have cleared out about 60,000 sq km of territory. We've liberated over four million people.\\" Mr McGurk's presence in Ayn Issa is part of a growing engagement from the US, which is backing the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition of Arab and Kurdish fighters leading the assault on Raqqa. As they advance into the city, families are fleeing. Many end up in a camp on the outskirts of Ayn Issa. Their futures look as uncertain as the future of Syria itself after more than six years of war. The people now staying in tents until recently lived under the harsh rule of IS. For some, even the heat and the dust feel like respite. But not all the inhabitants of the Ayn Issa camp were in the caliphate against their will. One corner of the camp is reserved for the wives and children of IS fighters. Perhaps not surprisingly, these people are not popular. Nour left Lebanon for Raqqa two years ago to join her husband, a jihadi. When he was killed, she married a Tunisian. And so she joined the ranks of a relatively privileged group: the wives of foreign fighters. She still seems to have little sympathy for the treatment of the thousands of Yazidi sex slaves at the hands of their IS captors. \\"There was a lot of tension between the wives and the sex slaves,\\" she said. \\"Some of the wives even divorced their husbands because of that. They were spending too much on the sex slaves, buying them the best makeup, clothes and accessories. \\"My first husband had an app on his phone. It was a market for sex slaves. They were sharing photos of the sex slaves with the best makeup and clothes, and asking 2,000 [Â£1,538] for this one, 3,000 for that one. A virgin cost 10,000.\\" The caliphate may be crumbling but the IS mentality persists. If the self-declared capital of IS falls, it will be in large part thanks to the support for the SDF from US forces and their international allies, including Britain. A US military transport plane touches down on a dirt runway carved discreetly into a hillside. This is the main logistics hub for the American effort in northern Syria. From this base, they support their own forces and arm the SDF. The US has been reluctant to publicise its presence in Syria. Their troops number in the hundreds. They will not say exactly how many. Their special forces are involved in fighting on the ground while their planes are bombing Raqqa from the sky. UN war crimes investigators warned earlier this month of \\"staggering loss of life\\", with hundreds of civilians killed since March, as coalition air strikes and artillery support the Kurdish-led offensive on the city. Lt Gen Stephen Townsend, the overall commander of the international coalition against IS in Iraq and Syria, rejected the charge that the US was taking insufficient care in its bombardment. \\"I would challenge anyone to find a more precise and careful campaign in the history of warfare on this planet,\\" he told the BBC. \\"I think we are being as careful as we need to be and as we can be, and I would challenge the individual from the UN who made this hyperbolic statement that civilian casualties are staggering. Show me some evidence of that.\\" The American logistics hub in northern Syria is one of a number of US bases in the area. Much of the infrastructure has been put in place in the last six months. Getting in is often easier that getting out, as the US military discovered in Afghanistan and Iraq. Syria may be no exception. \\"ISIS [IS] is certainly not defeated when Mosul is liberated or Raqqa is liberated,\\" says Lt Gen Townsend. \\"There is a lot of hard work left to do. Mosul and Raqqa are intermediate objectives on a path to a final victory.\\" What that final victory might look like is unclear. The end of the caliphate will not mean the end of the war in Syria. Earlier this month, a US fighter jet shot down a warplane belonging to the Russian-backed regime in Damascus. For now, Washington and Moscow share a common enemy. But once IS is gone, two big powers will be left backing different sides in an unfinished war. The potential for confrontation is real.

Write a title for this article: There was never much doubt that Pedro Martinez relished the idea of intimidating Yankee hitters and plunking them when he felt like it. On Wednesday he admitted the one guy with whom he considered it personal was Jorge Posada. On Wednesday’s Daily News Live, Martinez made it clear that he still holds a grudge against Posada, claiming the ex-Yankee catcher carried their running feud too far at one point by insulting the Red Sox pitcher’s mother. “Between Latinos you don’t mention anybody’s mother,” Pedro said. “And I never forgot that one. To this day.” Martinez was on the TV show with fellow newly elected Hall of Famers John Smoltz, Randy Johnson and Craig Biggio. When Daily News Live host Jonas Schwartz asked Martinez lightheartedly if he had a Yankee he preferred hitting the most, Martinez didn’t hesitate: When Schwartz asked why, Martinez said, “Because Jorge always seemed to have a bad attitude toward me.” Under further questioning Pedro admitted to making fun of Posada’s ears at times, saying, “I call him Dumbo, but that’s no reason for him to want to kill me.” Martinez, who hit Posada only once during his career, then seemed to change course, saying he never tried to hit Posada intentionally. Yet he said the bad blood came to a head during the Yankees-Red Sox 2003 post-season brawl, during which Martinez famously threw 72-year-old coach Don Zimmer to the ground. “Believe it or not we competed cleanly, I never tried to hit him or do anything,” Martinez said of Posada. “It was just competing. But he was always mad at me for some reason. “Then he let it go a little bit too far with the Zimmer incident. Between Latinos you don’t mention anybody’s mother. I did not appreciate that. I know it was in the heat of the situation, but that’s sensitive to Latino players.” Martinez wasn’t clear if Posada’s insult helped ignite the brawl or was delivered after Zimmer had charged Pedro and wound up on the ground. In any case, the Yankees were furious at Martinez that day when they felt he intentionally drilled Karim Garcia in the upper back. Posada was seen gesturing angrily from the dugout toward Martinez, and soon after the dugouts emptied when Manny Ramirez took exception to a high pitch from Roger Clemens. In 2013 Martinez told reporters that 90% of the batters he plunked during his career were hit intentionally, but he insisted he wasn’t trying to hit Garcia. Former Red Sox first baseman Kevin Millar, however, told the Daily News last year that Martinez hit Alfonso Soriano and Derek Jeter back-to-back in another famous incident intentionally in retaliation for Clemens plunking Millar. “First pitch to Soriano —wham! Up near the neck,\\" Millar said. “Next batter, Jeter — wham! Up near the neck. Pedro later told me, ‘You tell Clemens, he hits one of mine, I take two of his.’” MOBILE USER?

And the answer is?","completion":"The answer to the trivia question is Alfred, Lord Tennyson. He was the oldest man to become Poet Laureate. Tennyson was born on August 6, 1809, and he became the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom on November 19, 1850, succeeding William Wordsworth. At the time of his appointment, he was 41 years old. Alfred, Lord Tennyson, was an acclaimed British poet and remains one of the most popular and well-known poets in the English language. He wrote a vast range of works, including \\"In Memoriam A.H.H.,\\" a requiem for his close friend Arthur Hallam, the dramatic monologue “Ulysses,” and the famous \\"Charge of the Light Brigade,\\" which honored the heroism of British soldiers during the Crimean War. Tennyson's work was often characterized by its deep emotional resonance, vivid imagery, and mastery of metrical forms. As Poet Laureate, Tennyson was responsible for composing verse for significant national events, such as the birthdays and coronations of British monarchs, military victories, and other occasions of national importance. He held the position until his death in 1892, a tenure of more than 40 years. During his time as Poet Laureate, Tennyson continued to be a prolific writer, and his work remained widely popular throughout his lifetime. Because of his immense influence and popularity as a poet, Tennyson was made a Baron by Queen Victoria in 1884, after he turned down a similar offer several years earlier. As a result, he became the first British poet to be honored with a peerage. Following his death, Tennyson was buried in Westminster Abbey's Poets' Corner, a testament to his lasting legacy in the literary world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Where startups really get (cash) crunched If startups are facing a cash crunch, it isn’t when they start up. Venture capitalists today are buzzing about a Wall Street Journal story about how Internet startups are facing a “cash crunch.” It’s mostly based on AngelList data (or not, see update below), plus venture fund-raising statistics from Dow Jones. I don’t dispute either of them, but believe they need to be viewed in a broader context. More importantly, I think the real story they tell was overlooked. First, overall venture capital activity is not decreasing. Official Q3 data won’t be released until later this week, but a preliminary look shows that U.S.-based companies raised less money than in Q2 but more than in Q1. And since third quarters are traditionally slow due to the vacation months of July and August, there doesn’t seem to be much news in the top-line numbers. Moreover, around 49% of completed U.S. venture deals in the past three months were for seed-stage or early-stage companies. For the past 12 months, the figure stands at 47%. The difference in dollars invested as a percentage of the whole was negligible (from 30.4% for past 3 months to 30.6% for past 12 months). AngelList data is an important metric, but it also reflects the biases of a relatively small — and arguably skewed — subset of venture investors. For example, the recent market volatility has likely knocked out a lot of angel tourists who had been allocating 10 or 15% of their assets to venture investing (denominators don’t only affect public pension funds). Institutional VCs, however, have not been similarly affected (and I include super-angels in this category). It certainly is true that fewer and fewer VC firms are raising money, but that trend has been in place for years and there is still plenty of dry powder. After all, the rise of super-angels is barely one year old. Moreover, many larger firms have launched seed-stage investing programs within the past 18 months — thus increasing the overall capital pool for nascent startups. Examples include New Enterprise Associates, Greylock and Menlo Ventures. Some folks discount these programs as cynical window-dressing, but money is money within this particular argument (and I happen to think most of the programs are legit). To me, the larger issue is capital availability beyond the seed-stage. I’m not talking about massive Series F rounds for Facebook or Groupon, but rather Series A or B deals in the 5 million to 25 million range. This is where I see a bit of capital gap. How many venture firms out there market themselves as Series B investors, first and foremost? Not many (it’s no surprise that First Round Capital hasn’t been copied by a Second Round Capital or Third Round Capital). For example, expansion-stage deals made up 28% of all U.S. venture deals completed in the past 12 months, and around 35% of the total invested capital. Five years ago those figures were 36% and 42%, respectively. How come? Because post-seed A or B rounds often carry the same risks as seed with less potential reward. It’s one thing for an existing seed investor to participate pro rata, but quite another for an outsider to join the party (unless success seems obvious, at which point the valuation will be sky-high). In fact, that’s a pretty good case for entrepreneurs to sign on with larger institutional VCs at the seed-stage, rather than trying to rely on angels who are one 400-point Dow loss away from being tapped out. I know some entrepreneurs don’t want to get “lost” in a larger firm, and appreciate the personal attention and networks of angels. And there certainly can be a happy mix of both. But, if you have to choose, the institution is far more valuable. If Web startups are hitting a cash crunch, it’s likely because they chose the wrong seed-stage investors (assuming they had a “choice”) and there aren’t enough mid-round institutions to help them out. Update: AngelList’s Naval Ravikant just tweeted the following: Sign up for my daily email newsletter on deals and deal-makers: GetTermSheet.com What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses the current cash crunch situation that many startups are facing, focusing on the importance of looking at the broader context and examining trends in venture capital activity. Contrary to the widespread notion that venture capital activity is decreasing, the data shows that overall investment levels are not declining dramatically. Furthermore, the proportion of deals for seed-stage or early-stage companies remains consistent. However, the challenge lies in capital availability beyond the seed-stage, particularly in Series A or B deals that carry the same risks as seed-stage funding but with less potential reward. The article also highlights the potential for market volatility to impact angel investors, who may allocate a portion of their assets to venture investing. In contrast, institutional venture capitalists have not been similarly affected, suggesting that startups should focus on partnering with larger institutional VCs rather than relying solely on angels. This is because institutional investors are more stable and can provide valuable support to startups throughout their growth journey. The author argues that if web startups are experiencing a cash crunch, it could be because they have chosen the wrong seed-stage investors, and there are not enough mid-round institutions to provide support."},{"prompt":"Q: In this task, you're given the title of a story consisting of five sentences, numbered 1 through 5.

We stayed at TI and one evening after a long day of workshops and speeches, we wanted to just get something to eat downstairs at our hotel. We wandered around surveying our options. Unfortunately, we landed here because the boss was afraid to commit to any one particular genre of food and because she was afraid of not liking her food.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: \\"Nothing--nothing at all, damn it!\\" Hanson told him. Sentence 2: Hanson did nothing. Nothing at all. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Understanding the two sentences you provided, we need to analyze whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence or not. Entailment refers to the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another. If Sentence 1 entails Sentence 2, then Sentence 2 must be true whenever Sentence 1 is true. Let's break down the two sentences: Sentence 1: \\"Nothing--nothing at all, damn it!\\" Hanson told him. In this sentence, Hanson is expressing frustration or annoyance while stating that he did nothing or nothing of consequence. Here, we have a quote of what Hanson said, which implies that this is a direct statement from him. Sentence 2: Hanson did nothing. Nothing at all. In this sentence, we are told straightforwardly that Hanson did nothing and that he did \\"nothing at all.\\" It is a simple description of the situation, without emotions or quotations. Now, let's determine if there is an entailment between the two sentences: Both sentences do convey the same basic information: that Hanson did nothing. However, the first sentence has an added layer of emotion (frustration or annoyance) which is not included in the second sentence. Additionally, the first sentence presents the information as a quote, so we know that Hanson himself said it, while the second sentence is a simple statement with no indication of its source. Because the second sentence lacks the emotional aspect and the direct quote from Hanson, it does not contain all of the information present in the first sentence. However, the basic information—that Hanson did nothing—is consistent between both sentences. In conclusion, the second sentence is not completely entailed by the first sentence due to the differences mentioned above, but it is partly entailed because their core information is the same. When considering just the actions of Hanson, which is the primary subject of the sentences, the second sentence would be regarded as entailed by the first sentence since both communicate that Hanson did nothing. However, when taking into account aspects like the quote and emotions present in the first sentence, the entailment is not complete."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Addscrollloaditem (' img _ 1eb168effe' ) Remove the nut and washer and discard the nut. Answer:","completion":"After making sure that the wheel is free of any oil that could compromise its performance or the frame lining, the next most logical step would be to clean the surface of the rear hub center pulley. Use a dust cloth or a similar tool to clean the base sections properly. This is crucial in ensuring that the new hub bearing operates efficiently and lasts longer. Grime, road salt, and other particles can get lodged between the hub and the bearing, increasing wear and tear. Next, you will have to loosen the brake caliper so you can access the hub assembly. The brake caliper is fixed onto the wheel using a set of bolts attached to the back side of the caliper bracket. Using a tool, typically a socket wrench, carefully unscrew these bolts to free the brake caliper. Make sure to suspend the brake caliper in a manner that doesn't strain or damage the brake hose. Now it's time to remove the old hub bearing. Begin by removing the tailpipe from your rear light assembly. Depending on your vehicle's make, you may need a screwdriver to pry the tailpipe out. Be careful in this step, as you wouldn't want to damage the rear light assembly as it could affect your lights' functionality. After successfully removing the old hub bearing, it's time to set up the new one. It's recommended that you use a new nut when replacing the wheel bearing; they usually come packaged together. This new nut can help to ensure that the new bearing is secured properly. After the new bearing is placed and secure, carefully reassemble the wheel and tire assembly. Ensure all bolts and components have been put back correctly and are tightened adequately. Start your vehicle and give it a test to confirm if the replacement was successful. In summary, replacing a Ford Explorer's rear hub bearing involves few crucial steps: cleanup, dismantling, removing the old hub bearing, installing the new one, and reassembling the wheel mechanism. It's a somewhat complicated task that requires patience, precision, and the right tools, but with due diligence, it's doable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Unfortunately, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted my future occupation to be. The only thing I did know was that I did not want to spend the next 45 years teaching, being a nurse or sitting in an office. But that was before the postman delivered a catalogue of courses that were being offered at the local college. As I looked through it, I was attracted by a page that talked about the difficulties faced by deaf people in their everyday lives and how students could help by learning sign language. It went on to say that graduates of the course usually find work in different organizations, such as law companies, the Stock Exchange, insurance companies and banks. Then I saw something that really caught my eye: \\"Singer\\" are also needed for sporting events, concerts, theatrical performances and, believe it or not, circuses! By the time I got to the bottom of the page, I knew I had found the perfect occupation. I enrolled on the course, which to my parents' great delight was free of charge. The course was brilliant. My favourite part was the final lesson, when our teacher asked us to sign our favourite song. It was really difficult because not only did we have to sign the words, but we also had to find a way of showing whether the song was happy or sad and whether the beat was slow or fast. It was the hardest thing I have ever done--but also the most rewarding. Question: The only thing the writer knew that she _ .

The reviewer expresses strong discontent and dissatisfaction towards the movie they are discussing. The usage of words like \\"bad\\", \\"crappy\\", \\"idiot\\", \\"lame\\", \\"grotesque\\", \\"awful\\" and \\"waste\\" sets a negative tone and clearly articulates the reviewer's negative feelings. The review opens with the repetition of the word \\"bad,\\" constituting a profound negative sentiment at the outset. The description of the film as a \\"crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema\\" portrays the writer's belief that the film lacks intellectual and creative substance, is of substandard quality, and may not appeal to viewers who expect deeper content or more sophisticated humor, hence further emphasizing the negative sentiment. The reviewer strongly criticizes the casting and character development, particularly singling out the performances of Mike Myers and a Chinese actress who they feel did not contribute positively to the film. They also criticize the plot of the film which they describe as \\"lame\\" and filled with \\"dirty jokes\\", which they find unpleasant. This sentiment extends towards the future release mentioned, \\"Green-Eggs and Ham\\", where they express their skepticism and suspicion rather than excitement or anticipation. Moreover, they also express their concern that the film may ruin the legacy of the classic book it's based upon, indicating a sentiment of disappointment not only in the film but in its potential to negatively impact the perception of the original literary work. Their closing remark, \\"Don't waste time and money by seeing this\\" underscores their negative sentiment by advising potential viewers against watching the film. It is clear that the reviewer did not enjoy the film and feels strongly that it is not worth the time or investment, thereby conveying an overall negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Things started out well for Carolina, their first drive taking almost 6 minutes of clock to drive down into Jets territory when bad luck struck them. A miscommunication between Jake Delhomme and Steve Smith resulted in a pass being fired at Smith while he wasn't looking, and it caromed off of Smith's leg into the arms of Jets' CB Darrelle Revis, who returned it 67 yards for a TD. It was the first of Delhomme's 4 INTs of the day, two each by Revis and safety Kerry Rhodes. Rhodes' first set the Jets up in good field position, which the Jets were able to capitalize on when Thomas Jones ran the ball in for a 4-yard TD.

Republicans escalated their charges against the Obama administration for alleged failures in handling last month’s Libya attack, thrusting the death of the U.S. ambassador there into the center of the presidential campaign Friday. Mitt Romney accused his rival of “doubling down on denial” about the true origins of the Sept. 11 siege in Benghazi, which senior Obama officials initially said appeared to be an outgrowth of anti-American protests, not terrorism. Whether the administration has truthfully disclosed what it knew about the perpetrators of the attacks became a flash point in Thursday night’s debate, when Vice President Biden blamed the administration’s shifting explanations on U.S. intelligence agencies. “There were more questions that came out last night because the vice president directly contradicted the testimony of State Department officials,” Romney told supporters Friday at a campaign event in Richmond. “American citizens have a right to know just what’s going on.” Earlier in the week, State Department officials had said that they had not received reports of protests outside the compound before the killings. But Biden said the explanation that the attacks grew from a protest — rather than from terrorists determined to hit the consulate — persisted “because that’s exactly what we were told” by intelligence officials. After trying for weeks to portray the deaths in Benghazi as part of a larger failure of Obama’s foreign policy, Republicans now sense their first real opening on national security, an area that has long been considered one of the president’s strengths. It was an unexpected twist that the administration seemed to grow more vulnerable following the debate between Biden, a veteran of global diplomacy and the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Ryan, a relative novice whose expertise is the domestic budget. 1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Romney on the campaign trail View Photos Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, buoyed by his performance in the Oct. 3 presidential debate, has been making more of a presence in Virginia this past week, speaking at a campaign rally in Richmond and elsewhere throughout the swing state.

Melina Mara/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Obama officials moved swiftly Friday to blunt further fallout, first during the White House briefing and later in a speech by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. “There is nobody in the administration motivated by anything other than trying to understand what happened,” Clinton said. “We do not have all the answers. No one in this administration has ever claimed otherwise.” In Thursday’s debate, Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan raised the possibility that the White House had blamed the attacks on anti-American protests at first because a successful terrorist attack would blemish Obama’s national security credentials. The successful killing of Osama bin Laden is a stock Obama campaign theme, and he frequently tells audiences that his administration has al-Qaeda “on its heels.” “Look, if we are hit by terrorists, we’re going to call it for what it is — a terrorist attack,” Ryan said. Romney continued that theme Friday, telling voters at a campaign rally that he would investigate the varying accounts. There are multiple investigations into the attack: an FBI probe into the deaths of the four Americans, an independent inquiry by a panel appointed by Clinton and at least two congressional probes. As Republicans pounced on Biden’s remarks, White House press secretary Jay Carney and Clinton said Friday that there was no selective use of intelligence about the attacks. “We have been very transparent about what we know,” Carney said. “As hours and days and weeks have passed by and more facts have come to light and more has been revealed through the investigations underway, that, you know, we have gained a clearer picture of what happened and what did not happen.” Administration accounts have evolved because information about the attacks has evolved, Clinton said. “We are providing the best information we have at that time and that information continues to be updated, it also continues to be put into context and more deeply understood through the process we are engaged in,” she said. Another point of contention is whether the White House should have been alerted to requests by security officials for more manpower ahead of the Benghazi attack. Biden suggested on Thursday night that the security requests had not made their way back to Washington — a claim that was quickly contested. Two former security officials testified before Congress this week that they had made requests for more manpower that were either ignored or rejected. Senior State Department officials acknowledged the requests but said there was no evidence that additional security would have prevented the attack. On Friday, administration officials clarified that what Biden said during the Thursday debate — that “we did not know they wanted more security” — meant only that the White House had not been informed of the threat by the State Department, not that no one in the administration had been informed. “There was no actionable intelligence regarding the Benghazi facility” that could have been used to prevent the attack, Carney said, and continued questions about what the administration knew are “an effort here to politicize this, to turn this into an issue in the campaign.” Carney and congressional Democrats have said some of the Republicans now criticizing embassy security had voted to cut the State Department’s security budget. Republicans counter that Democrats also voted for smaller security budgets. In separate remarks Friday, Clinton repeatedly vowed to find out what happened and to do everything possible to protect diplomats in the field. But she said the business of diplomacy, like combat, involves a calculated risk. “We will not retreat,” she said in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. “We will never prevent every act of violence or terrorism, or achieve perfect security,” Clinton said. “Our people can’t live in bunkers and do their jobs. But it is our solemn responsibility to constantly improve, to reduce the risks our people face and make sure they have the resources they need to do their jobs.” She spoke a day after a Yemeni security official at the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa was killed on his way to work.

In a pair of campaign rallies, the Republican presidential candidate and his running mate Paul Ryan took direct aim at Obama and his administration over allegations of mishandled security in Libya and contradictory statements issued afterward. Text Size - + reset “Yesterday I raised some questions about Benghazi and the tragedy that occurred there, and there are more questions that came out of last night because the vice president directly contradicted the sworn testimony of State Department officials,” Romney said at an afternoon campaign rally in Richmond, Va. “He’s doubling down on denial, and we need to understand exactly what happened. … American citizens have a right to know just what is going on and we’re going to find out.” Ryan took up the mantle in Lancaster, Ohio. Speaking before a packed crowd Ryan said, “We’re talking about blame. First they blame a YouTube video and a nonexistent riot, then when the country is getting upset about it, they blame Romney-Ryan for getting people upset about it.” “They keep changing their story. This is not what leadership looks like,” he added. The push to emphasize Obama’s foreign policy and concerns in Libya comes a day after Vice President Joe Biden and Ryan faced off over the issue in their only debate of the campaign. The pair traded barbs on Libya after Ryan criticized the Obama administration’s lack of “leadership” in dealing with the issue. To which Biden responded that the claim was “a bunch of malarkey” and said that Republicans would cut embassy funding “300 million below what we asked for.” The Obama administration has come under attack for security decisions it made in Benghazi and for not increasing security after State Department personnel reportedly asked for it. The administration had originally blamed the attack on riots and downplayed any connections with terrorists, but has since backed away from those statements. ||||| WASHINGTON — In the weeks leading up to the attack last month on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, diplomats on the ground sounded increasingly urgent alarms. In a stream of diplomatic cables, embassy security officers warned their superiors at the State Department of a worsening threat from Islamic extremists, and requested that the teams of military personnel and State Department security guards who were already on duty be kept in service. The requests were denied, but they were largely focused on extending the tours of security guards at the American Embassy in Tripoli — not at the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, 400 miles away. And State Department officials testified this week during a hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that extending the tour of additional guards — a 16-member military security team — through mid-September would not have changed the bloody outcome because they were based in Tripoli, not Benghazi. The handling of these requests has now been caught up in a sharply partisan debate over whether the Obama administration underestimated the terrorist threat in Libya. In a debate with Representative Paul D. Ryan on Thursday night, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said White House officials were not told about requests for any additional security. “We weren’t told they wanted more security again,” Mr. Biden said. The Romney campaign on Friday pounced on the conflicting statements, accusing Mr. Biden of continuing to deny the nature of the attack. The White House scrambled to explain the apparent contradiction between Mr. Biden’s statement and the testimony from State Department officials at the House hearing. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said Friday that security issues related to diplomatic posts in Libya and other countries were dealt with at the State Department, not the White House. Based on interviews with administration officials, as well as in diplomatic cables, and Congressional testimony, those security decisions appear to have been made largely by midlevel State Department security officials, and did not involve Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or her top aides. While it is unclear what impact a handful of highly trained additional guards might have had in Benghazi were they able to deploy there, some State Department officials said it would probably not have made any difference in blunting the Sept. 11 assault from several dozen heavily armed militants. “An attack of that kind of lethality, we’re never going to have enough guns,” Patrick F. Kennedy, under secretary of state for management, said at Wednesday’s hearing. “We are not an armed camp ready to fight it out.” A senior administration official said that the military team, which was authorized by a directive from Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, was never intended to have an open-ended or Libya-wide mission. “This was not a SWAT team with a DC-3 on alert to jet them off to other cities in Libya to respond to security issues,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. Security in Benghazi had been a growing concern for American diplomats this year. In April, the convoy of the United Nations special envoy for Libya was attacked there. In early June, a two-vehicle convoy carrying the British ambassador came under attack by rocket-propelled grenades. Militants struck the American mission with a homemade bomb, but no one was hurt. In late June, the Red Cross was attacked and the organization pulled out. “We were the last thing on their target list to remove from Benghazi,” Lt. Col. Andrew Wood of the Utah National Guard, who was deployed in Tripoli as the leader of the American military security unit, told the House committee. But friends and colleagues of Ambassador Stevens said he was adamant about maintaining an American presence in Benghazi, the heart of the opposition to the Qaddafi government. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"This long article essentially revolves around the events surrounding the 2012 attacks on U.S. diplomatic compounds in Libya, particularly in Benghazi, and the political discussions and investigations that followed. The article begins by detailing the global protests ignited by an anti-Islam film, which started outside the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and extended as far as India. Over 50 people died across the world due to violence linked to this film, which was perceived as mocking Islam and Prophet Mohammed. The focus then shifts to the political arena in the United States, where Republicans accused the Obama administration of mishandling the Libya attack specifically in Benghazi, where U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed. This led to the issue of the events in Benghazi becoming central to the presidential campaign at the time. Mitt Romney, who was the Republican presidential nominee, accused President Obama of denial about the true motive of the Benghazi attack, which senior officials from Obama's administration initially ascribed to anti-American protests rather than terrorism. This led to the genesis of multiple investigations into the attack, including an FBI probe and a congressional probe. The Administration, particularly Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, defended their handling of the situation, arguing that their accounts evolved as better information became available. Biden suggested that the White House had not been informed of the need for increased security, a claim that was challenged and led to further political debate. The article ends with descriptions of increasingly alarmed diplomatic cables sent pre-attack by U.S. diplomats in Libya, warning of a rising threat from Islamic extremists. Romney's campaign capitalized on the confusion between Biden's statements during a debate and the testimonies of State Department officials in a hearing, further politicizing the issue. There was a division in opinion on what impact a few more guards might have had on the situation in Benghazi, with some believing it would not have thwarted the lethal attack. Across these developments, politicians, state officials, and diplomats grappled with contradictions, evolving narratives, and finger-pointing, all under the looming shadow of the Benghazi tragedy. The killings, and how they were handled, became a pivotal point in the U.S. presidential election campaign, illustrating how foreign policy can directly spill over into domestic politics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is not possible to tell In analyzing these two sentences, we need to determine if the second sentence can be logically deduced from the first sentence or not. The first sentence is a statement of apology from an unidentified speaker to Dave Hanson, communicating a sense of gentleness. The second sentence refers to someone, presumably the speaker from the first sentence, refusing to say anything to Dave Hanson. The two sentences do relate to the same character, Dave Hanson, but they do not share a direct logical connection. The first sentence conveys an apology, while the second represents a refusal to communicate. These situations could be referring to different contexts or events, and without further information, it is impossible to determine how they relate to each other. Moreover, while it is implied that the same speaker is involved in both sentences, it is not explicitly stated. Therefore, without additional context, it is not possible to tell whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. The information provided in the two sentences is not sufficient for a definite conclusion about their relationship.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more. They key is to cut it off at the pass. Question: Immediately after the end of this text, the narrator is Answer: Choices: [I] Happy he spoke up. [II] not enough information. [III] a new BA manager.

Article: My wife passed away a few years ago, and I went through the worst time in my life. I even wanted to kill myself. Just for kids, I had to continue to live and work as small-town doctor at my medical clinic in Hawaii. My kids had gone to live on the mainland, and I was alone. Then they asked me to have a family trip. On our trip, we turned on the TV at the motel and saw the second plane crash into the World Trade Center. Seeing it falling down, I said to my kids: \\"I'm going to Afghanistan\\". And a few weeks later, international Medical Corps sent me to set up 20 clinics in provinces where people had no health care. In these field clinics surrounded by frightening shoots or deadly bombs, we were eventually serving 27,000 patients a month in a very busy schedule. Tired and nervous, I gradually had a sense of achievement, a sense of purpose, and my depression went away. In the years to follow, I went to Indonesia after the tsunami, Pakistan after the earthquakes, Sudan after the civil warm and Iraq after more and more bombs. Each time after disasters one after another, hundreds of people were killed, wounded and many more had to flee. We once set up movable clinics in an area with 19,000 _ , and it was supposed to hold 13,000 originally. Flu broke out, one of the biggest killers of kids in refugee camps, and it spread like wildfire. Water and food were also serious problems. \\"Adventures or not?\\" I often asked myself.

Mary Ellen Keating, a company spokesperson, told Ars by e-mail that while earlier reports of the firing of the entire Nook hardware team were incorrect, there were indeed some “job eliminations across the organization.\\" Keating declined to give any more specifics. Last month, three top B&N Nook executives also left the company. In her e-mail, Keating added: We believe we have a strong management team in place at Nook, having recruited significant new talent. The new Nook management team is focused on managing the business efficiently so that it becomes financially strong while at the same time aggressively moving to drive revenue growth. In January 2014, Barnes & Noble also announced that “device and accessories sales” plummeted to 88.7 million during the October through December 2013 holiday period, a drop of 66.7 percent. The company attributed the loss to “lower unit selling volume and lower average selling prices.” Of course, that was prime shopping season, when most retailers see a spike in sales. The company added that “digital content sales” were 36.5 million during the same time frame, a drop of 27.3 percent. ||||| Spencer Platt/Getty Images Barnes & Noble laid off its Nook hardware engineers, according to a source that tipped Business Insider. The engineers were let go last Thursday, according to our source. This follows Barnes & Noble dismissing the VP of Hardware, Bill Saperstein in January. Barnes & Noble confirmed that it laid people off when we asked. A spokesperson told us: \\"We've been very clear about our focus on rationalizing the NOOK business and positioning it for future success and value creation. As we've aligned NOOK's cost structure with business realities, staffing levels in certain areas of our organization have changed, leading to some job eliminations. We're not going to comment specifically on those eliminations.\\" The Nook was its answer to the Amazon's Kindle. Barnes & Noble tried making a Nook e-reader, and a Nook tablet that competed with the iPad, and the Kindle Fire. It was a bold, and aggressive attempt to fend off the rise of Internet companies that were destroying booksellers. It did not work, though. In the September quarter of last year, Nook revenue was down 32.2% on a year-over-year basis, and it had an EBITDA loss of 45.2 million. Those numbers made Nook the worst- performing part of Barnes & Noble. Barnes & Noble has been talking about reducing the size of its Nook business for a year. Last February, Barnes & Noble executives were privately acknowledging that the Nook line needs to go. It decided to move away from making its own devices, and focus on just doing its own applications, and digital distribution. Barnes & Noble stopped making a tablet, but continued making a Nook e-reader, the GlowLight. We're not sure what the future holds for the GlowLight. While it's shedding staff, a spokesperson said Barnes & Noble remains committed to the Nook group: \\"We believe we have a strong management team in place at NOOK, having recruited significant new talent. The new NOOK management team is focused on managing the business efficiently so that it becomes financially strong while at the same time aggressively moving to drive revenue growth.\\" Update: After posting this, Barnes & Noble told us that it did not eliminate its entire hardware department, but it declined to provide specifics. |||||Summary:","completion":"Barnes and Noble, a big bookstore company, makes an electronic book reader called Nook.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Sympatric Speciation Can divergence occur if no physical barriers are in place to separate individuals who continue to live and reproduce in the same habitat? The answer is yes. The process of speciation within the same space is called sympatric speciation; the prefix “sym” means same, so “sympatric” means “same homeland” in contrast to “allopatric” meaning “other homeland. ” A number of mechanisms for sympatric speciation have been proposed and studied. One form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division. In a normal cell division event chromosomes replicate, pair up, and then separate so that each new cell has the same number of chromosomes. However, sometimes the pairs separate and the end cell product has too many or too few individual chromosomes in a condition called aneuploidy (Figure 18.14).

Israel terror victims fight Shalit deal in court Jerusalem (CNN) -- Families of Israeli terror victims are urging the country's Supreme Court Monday to block the release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Three petitions were submitted to the Supreme Court on Sunday after Israel released the names of the first group of prisoners to be freed. \\"The goal of this petition is to stop the madness. We are very afraid that the terror will again rule the streets -- that they will murder us again in restaurants, in cafes, at night in bed, at kindergartens and in schools,\\" said Meir Schijveschuurder, whose parents and three siblings were killed in the 2001 bombing of a Sbarro pizza restaurant. Two other families that lost loved ones in a 2003 bombing of a bus in Haifa filed civil lawsuits against the plotters of the attack. \\"It may sound like I am a drowning man clutching at a straw, but this is the least that we can do ... at this time,\\" said Ron Kerman, whose daughter was killed. Shalit's father Noam was in court to oppose their petitions. \\"We understand the hearts of the bereaved families -- we are a bereaved family as well,\\" Shalit's mother Aviva said on Israeli television Sunday. \\"But in spite of this any delay in the deal might endanger Gilad's life. It's a life-saving matter. I request that when my son returns home you will help us help in his recovery.\\" The Israeli public overwhelmingly supports the exchange of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners for Shalit, an Israeli army sergeant who was abducted in a raid in 2006, when he was 19 years old. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote to the families of terror victims to say he understood their pain. \\"You were in my thoughts during the many uncertainties that have accompanied me in the negotiations,\\" he said in the letter, which was released by his office. \\"The decision regarding the release of Gilad Shalit is one of the hardest I have taken ... I understand the difficulty in digesting that these villains who committed these crimes against your loved ones will not be paying the full price that they deserve to,\\" Netanyahu wrote. But, he said: \\"The state of Israel does not abandon its soldiers and its citizens.\\" Nearly eight out of 10 Israelis favor the deal, according to the poll of 500 people conducted by the Dahaf Polling Institute for the daily Yedioth Aharonoth. Israelis are equally split on whether \\"the release of terrorists\\" will harm Israeli security, with 50% saying \\"Yes\\" and 48% saying \\"No\\" -- a statistical tie given the number of people polled. The families of some Palestinian prisoners being released had mixed feelings about the deal, they told CNN. Mohamad Abu Khalil, whose son got three life sentences plus 90 years in jail, is glad his son Ayman is being freed -- but said he won't be coming home. \\"It's better that Ayman is going to be released from Israeli jails, but sad that he won't be around his family here. It's better to be transferred to another country than being in Israeli jails,\\" his father said. The official Israeli list of prisoner releases lists him as being sent \\"abroad,\\" rather than to Gaza or the West Bank, without specifying where. The Israel Defense Forces declared a number of sites connected to the prisoner transfer and Shalit release to be closed military zones as of Monday. The list released by Israel features 477 names, including those of Ahlam Tamimi, serving life terms for being an accomplice in the Sbarro bombing, and Amneh Muna, who plotted the killing of a 16-year-old Israeli boy in 2001 and received a life sentence. The most notable name not on the list is that of jailed Palestinian lawmaker Marwan Barghouti, who is serving five life sentences. He was convicted in an Israeli court on murder and other charges related to his role in planning attacks on Israelis during the second Intifada. Israel approved the deal last week, agreeing to release in two stages 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including hundreds serving life sentences for attacks on Israelis. Shalit has been held incommunicado by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza, since his seizure. The first swap is expected to take place early this week, with the second stage scheduled for later this year. Israel's Prisons Authority said the Palestinians slated for release are being taken to two facilities -- one for the 27 female prisoners on the list, the rest for the men -- from which they will be released together. Once freed, they will be under various restrictions on a case-by-case basis: Some will not be allowed to leave the country, while others will have other restrictions on their movement or be required to report their whereabouts to local police, Justice Ministry spokesman Moshe Cohen told CNN. Shalit, meanwhile, will be transferred back into Israeli territory via the Kerem Shalom border crossing and will undergo medical tests and debriefing at an air force base, the Israeli military said. Once that is complete, he will be flown to his home at Mitzpe Hila, north of Haifa. Shalit's family has continuously petitioned Israeli government officials to broker a deal that would secure his release.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Which kingdom had their king baptized in 580? John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century.

Help as much as you can. I know that the answer to the question \\"Who is the defendant in Hill v. McDonough?\\" is in \\"Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay.

Wings was active from 1971 to 1981 and released several chart-topping albums. Linda, though primarily known for her photography and animal rights activism, was a key member of Wings, contributing keyboards and vocals. In 1973, the producers of the James Bond films approached McCartney to compose the theme song for \\"Live and Let Die,\\" which would be the eighth film in the Bond series, and the first to feature Roger Moore as the famous spy. McCartney agreed, and with Linda, wrote the song, introducing a more modern, rock-infused sound to the traditionally orchestral music of the James Bond films. \\"Live and Let Die\\" became a standout in both the Bond theme pantheon and the discography of Wings. It is an interesting blend of various music genres, mixing elements of rock, reggae, and orchestral styles. McCartney's strong, melodious voice, combined with the song's dynamic range of tempo and tone, made it an instant classic. In the decades since its release, \\"Live and Let Die\\" has been covered by various other artists, including Guns N' Roses, whose version was nominated for a Grammy Award. Despite the numerous renditions, the original version by Paul McCartney and Wings is still widely enjoyed by fans around the world. Sir Paul McCartney, as a solo artist and as a member of Wings and The Beatles, continues to be one of the most successful and influential songwriters and musicians in the history of recorded music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Argentina declares mourning for flood victims Parents demands common forms for nursery admissions On a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\", how closely does the first sentence resemble the second one?","completion":"In terms of meaning overlap, the first sentence – \\"Argentina declares mourning for flood victims\\" – and the second sentence – \\"Parents demand common forms for nursery admissions\\" – have very little in common, and I would rate the similarity between these two sentences at a 0.5 out of 5. To better understand why these two sentences do not closely resemble each other, let's analyze both of them separately. The first sentence, \\"Argentina declares mourning for flood victims,\\" discusses a specific country (Argentina) and its response to a natural disaster (flooding) that has led to a number of casualties. The mourning declaration is likely a formal recognition and expression of grief for those who have lost their lives or been affected by this devastating event. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Parents demand common forms for nursery admissions,\\" pertains to the requests of parents for a standardized process in nursery or pre-school admissions. This topic is more about education and the administrative aspects of enrolling children in early learning institutions. It does not have any direct connection to natural disasters, a specific country's response to such incidents, or expressions of grief and mourning. Hence, both sentences address very different subjects with distinct themes – one being a response to a natural disaster, while the other is related to the education system and admission procedures. The low 0.5 score on the 0-5 scale is given solely due to the fact that both sentences involve a form of organized response to a particular issue by a concerned party (Argentina's government or parents, respectively)."},{"prompt":"What is the missing first step of the following process: - Ocean water pulls sand off of beaches - Ocean water breaks rocks off of cliffs - Ocean water carries sand and rocks into the ocean - Sand and rocks go to other land or the bottom of the ocean.","completion":"The missing first step is: Wave action and currents erode the coastline."},{"prompt":"Generate a question that has the following answer: bloody axe for the following movie plot: In summer of 1958, Barry and Claudette, two Camp Crystal Lake counselors, sneak into a storage barn to copulate.

Enos, a truck driver agrees to drive Annie halfway. An elder named Ralph reacts to this by warning Annie that the camp has a \\"death curse\\".

Soon, the killer arrives and begins to kill the counselors, including Steve. Worried, Alice and Bill, the only two left, leave the main cabin to investigate only to discover a bloody axe in Brenda's bed, the phones disconnected, and the cars inoperable.

A gypsy woman in the group attempts to flee with her deformed baby, but Frollo chases and kills her outside Notre Dame. He tries to kill the baby as well, but the cathedral's archdeacon intervenes and accuses Frollo of murdering an innocent woman. To atone for his sin, Frollo reluctantly agrees to raise the deformed child in Notre Dame as his son, naming him Quasimodo. Twenty years later, Quasimodo develops into a kind yet isolated young man who has lived inside the cathedral his entire life. A trio of living stone gargoylesâVictor, Hugo, and Laverneâserve as Quasimodo's only company, and encourage him to attend the annually-held Festival of Fools. Despite Frollo's warnings that he would be shunned for his deformity, Quasimodo attends the festival and is celebrated for his awkward appearance, only to be humiliated by the crowd after Frollo's men start a riot. Frollo refuses to help Quasimodo, but Esmeralda, a kind gypsy, intervenes by freeing the hunchback, and uses a magic trick to evade arrest.

Here is a news article: The Navy has banned vaping throughout its fleet after multiple explosions caused by overheating batteries, it announced Friday. “The fleet commanders implemented this policy to protect the safety and welfare of sailors and to protect the ships, submarines, aircraft and equipment,” a press release said. ADVERTISEMENT “Multiple sailors have suffered serious injuries from these devices, to include first- and second-degree burns and facial disfigurement.” The ban covers the use, possession, storage and charging of e-cigarettes aboard ships, submarines, aircraft, boats, craft and heavy equipment. It applies to sailors, Marines, Military Sealift Command civilians and any personnel working on or visiting those units. The ban goes into effect May 14 and will last “until a final determination can be made following a thorough analysis,” the release said. Deployed units can ask for an extension to keep their e-cigarettes until their next port visit, but supervisors have to make sure the batteries are removed and stored in plastic non-conductive container. Sailors in bases on shore will still be allowed to vape in designated smoking areas, the release noted. Between October 2015 and June 2016, there were 15 incidents involving e-cigarettes that injured sailors, started fires or damaged material, according to the Naval Safety Center. In two of the incidents, the device was in the sailor’s mouth at the time, causing facial and dental injuries. ||||| Navy Tells Sailors To Leave The E-Cigarette On Shore Enlarge this image toggle caption Marko Drobnjakovic/AP Marko Drobnjakovic/AP After a series of \\"mishaps,\\" the Navy says it will no longer allow sailors to bring electronic cigarettes onto its ships, submarines, aircraft, boats, craft and heavy equipment. \\"The prohibition applies to Sailors, Marines, Military Sealift Command civilians and any personnel working on or visiting those units,\\" according to a statement obtained by NPR's Sarah McCammon, issued by the commanders of the U.S. Fleet Forces and the U.S. Pacific Fleet. \\"The Fleet commanders implemented this policy to protect the safety and welfare of Sailors and to protect the ships, submarines, aircraft and equipment,\\" it adds. The ban will go into force on May 14 and will \\"remain in effect until a final determination can be made following a thorough analysis,\\" the Navy says. At the same time, \\"sailors on shore will still be allowed to use [Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems] on base, but must do so in designated smoking areas ashore while on military installations.\\" The problem is e-cigarette lithium-ion batteries that can explode. Last year, Navy Times reported that the Naval Safety Center called for a full ban of the devices on Navy property, citing their \\"significant and unacceptable risk.\\" In August, Navy spokeswoman Lt. Marycate Walsh told the publication that \\"leadership is reviewing the Naval Safety Center's recommendation regarding e-cigarettes, weighing both the safety and health-related risks.\\" A Navy memorandum states that 15 \\"mishaps\\" occurred between October 2015 and June 15, 2016, that resulted in either injury to Navy personnel or \\"fire/materiel damage.\\" \\"Eight of these incidents occurred onboard Naval vessels/aircraft,\\" the memo reads. \\"Nine of 15 reported incidents described the failure mechanism as explosive. ... Two battery explosions occurred with the electronic cigarette in the service member's mouth resulting in facial and dental injuries.\\" The memo says the Navy has no record of any such incidents prior to October 2015. The Navy says there is increased use of e-cigarettes among Navy personnel — and the apparent dangers have been highlighted in Navy publications. A four-page spread in the Navy magazine Sea Compass titled \\"Danger: The Hidden Risks of Vaping\\" tells the story of two sailors who were the victims of an exploding battery. One received first-degree burns, while the other's car was destroyed by the fire. \\"Imagine what would have happened if the batteries had exploded while in their home, the barracks or even onboard their ship,\\" the article says. \\"The loss of property and potential loss of life could have been catastrophic.\\" As the Navy has noted, the dangers of exploding batteries can be mitigated by properly stowing the devices, using the correct charger, buying equipment from a reputable manufacturer and not modifying it. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration finalized its first regulations for e-cigarettes last year. The U.S. Department of Transportation formally banned e-cigarette use on commercial flights last year. The ban is meant to protect other passengers from the vapor, due to a lack of information about the ingredients in e-cigarettes. A Navy spokesman says regulations allow personnel to smoke tobacco cigarettes on a ship's \\"smoke deck\\" at designated times. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The US Navy has banned the use of e-cigarettes throughout its fleet due to multiple explosions caused by overheating batteries.

As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€. It’s a nice cool 14°C (57°F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above. It is damp in places and the ground can be slippery so watch your step as you walk.

This was a new and much debated category invented on behalf of the UK government, based on an individual being considered a 'Grave and Immediate Danger' to the general public, and meeting some combination of criteria for personality disorders and/or high scores on the Hare Psychopathy Check list - Revised. The Paddock Centre was designed to eventually house 72 patients, but never opened more than four of its six 12-bedded wards. The Dept of Health and Ministry of Justice National Personality Disorder Strategy published in October 2011 concluded that the resources invested in the DSPD programme should instead be used in prison based treatment programmes and the DSPD service at Broadmoor was required to close by 31 March 2012. The patients were transferred either back to prison, on to medium secure units to continue treatment, on to the residual national DSPD service at the Peaks Unit in Rampton, or to elsewhere in Broadmoor in the Personality Disorder directorate.

We want a clean ball so the paint can stick better. 2. Choose paint type: We'll need a special paint to color our ball. We pick outdoor acrylic paint because it's strong and can survive rain and sun in the garden. 3. Pick fun colors: You can choose your favorite colors or even pick a theme like the rainbow, flowers, or stars. We'll need a few colors to make it more fun! 4. Prepare the ball: We will place the ball on a stand or a bucket so it doesn't roll away and we can paint on it easily. 5. Start painting: Using paint brushes, we'll gently paint the ball with our chosen colors. We can make patterns like dots, stripes, or even paint little pictures of your favorite animals. 6. Let it dry: After painting, we'll wait for some hours to let our ball dry. The paint needs time to become strong and stick on the ball. 7. Seal the paint: To protect our pretty ball from rain and sunshine, we'll use a clear outdoor sealer. We'll paint it all over the ball and let it dry again. 8. Time to decorate: Once the sealer is dry, our beautiful Garden Sphere is ready! We can place it in your garden, and it'll make a fun, colorful decoration. Remember, you can ask for help from a grown-up to make your Garden Sphere and be careful when using paint and the sealer.

If Jim lowers carbon dioxide to the ocean, the level of acidity in the ocean becomes greater or smaller? Answer:","completion":"If Jim lowers the level of carbon dioxide in the ocean, the level of acidity in the ocean becomes smaller. The passage states that higher levels of dissolved carbon dioxide in ocean water cause the water to become more acidic. Thus, if Jim lowers the amount of carbon dioxide in the ocean, it will result in a decrease in the dissolved carbon dioxide levels. Consequently, the water will become less acidic, and the level of acidity will become smaller. This is due to the relationship between carbon dioxide and ocean acidity. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms carbonic acid, which contributes to the overall acidity of the water. By lowering the concentration of carbon dioxide in the ocean, Jim is effectively reducing the amount of carbonic acid formed, leading to a smaller level of acidity in the ocean."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Reginald Martinez Jackson (born May 18, 1946) is an American former professional baseball right fielder who played 21 seasons for the Kansas City / Oakland Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, New York Yankees, and California Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). Jackson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1993. Jackson was nicknamed \\"Mr. October\\" for his clutch hitting in the postseason with the Athletics and the Yankees. He helped Oakland win five consecutive American League West divisional pennants, three consecutive American League pennants and three consecutive World Series titles, from 1971 to 1975. Context: In 1980, Jackson batted .300 for the only time in his career, and his 41 home runs tied with Ben Oglivie of the Milwaukee Brewers for the American League lead. However, the Yankees were swept in the ALCS by the Kansas City Royals. As he entered the last year of his Yankee contract in 1981, Jackson endured several difficulties from George Steinbrenner. After the owner consulted Jackson about signing then-free agent Dave Winfield, Jackson expected Steinbrenner to work out a new contract for him as well. Steinbrenner never did (some say never intending to) and Jackson played the season as a free agent. Jackson started slowly with the bat, and when the 1981 Major League Baseball strike began, Steinbrenner invoked a clause in Jackson's contract forcing him to take a complete physical examination. Jackson was outraged and blasted Steinbrenner in the media. When the season resumed, Jackson's hitting improved, partly to show Steinbrenner he wasn't finished as a player. He hit a long home run into the upper deck in Game Five of the strike-forced 1981 American League Division Series with the Brewers, and the Yankees went on to win the pennant again. However, Jackson injured himself running the bases in Game Two of the 1981 ALCS and missed the first two games of the World Series, both of which the Yankees won. Jackson was medically cleared to play Game Three, but manager Bob Lemon refused to start him or even play him, allegedly acting under orders from Steinbrenner. The Yankees lost that game and Jackson played the remainder of the series, hitting a home run in Game Four. However, they lost the last three games and the World Series to the Dodgers. Jackson had faced the Dodgers four straight times in the World Series by 1981. No other player in Major League history has played against the same team more consecutive times in the Fall Classic. Question: What were his trouble with Steinbrenner?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Reginald Martinez Jackson had a fraught relationship with George Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees, particularly in 1981. As Jackson was entering the last year of his contract with the Yankees in 1981, Steinbrenner involved him in conversations regarding signing Dave Winfield, who was a free agent at the time. Consequently, Jackson held an expectation that Steinbrenner would negotiate a new contract for him as well. However, this expectation was left unfulfilled. Steinbrenner never worked out a new contract for Jackson, leading some to believe that Steinbrenner never actually intended to. This contractual strand left Jackson to play the season as a free agent. Jackson's on-field performance also added strain to the relationship with Steinbrenner. During the early part of the season, he was performing poorly with the bat. Moreover, when the 1981 Major League Baseball strike began, Steinbrenner invoked a clause in Jackson's contract that required him to undertake a comprehensive physical examination. This move by Steinbrenner drew outrage from Jackson, who did not hold back in criticizing Steinbrenner in public through the media. When the season resumed, Jackson was determined to prove his worth as a player partly to contradict Steinbrenner's doubts. However, he sustained an injury while running bases during the American League Championship Series (ALCS), temporarily sidelining him. Even after obtaining medical clearance to play, Jackson faced another slight when he was neither started nor played in Game Three of the World Series, reportedly due to instructions from Steinbrenner. Throughout this period, despite his challenges and his contentious relationship with Steinbrenner, Jackson remained an important part of the Yankees' line-up. Most notably, he hit a significant home run in Game Four of the World Series, although this wasn't enough to lead the team to victory and they lost the series to the Dodgers. In summary, Jackson's friction with Steinbrenner stemmed from contractual issues and Steinbrenner seeming to doubt Jackson's physical fitness and worth as a player. The conflicting interests and tensions between these two figures could not be resolved effectively, leading to a difficult and challenging period in Jackson's career with the Yankees."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The oldest website on the Internet is the CERN website, which was created in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. This makes it a unique distinction from being an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value. To provide some context, Tim Berners-Lee is an English engineer and computer scientist who is best known for inventing the World Wide Web (WWW). The World Wide Web is an information space where documents and other digital resources are identified using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). Resources shared using the Internet protocol suite play a significant role in the functioning of the World Wide Web. In 1989, while working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), Berners-Lee proposed a project called \\"Information Management: A Proposal\\" that envisioned a network of interconnected documents accessible through the Internet. This proposal eventually led to the creation of the first-ever website, which was published on August 6, 1991. The website contained a vast amount of information about hypertext, the technical aspects of creating web pages, and guidelines on how to create one's own web server. The original website is no longer live as it was initially; however, CERN has recreated the original web page at a new address (http://info.cern.ch/) to preserve its historical significance.

Why is Spotify not available in India?","completion":"While both questions essentially inquire about the same subject - the unavailability of Spotify in India - they are not structured identically, and thus are not the same in their phrasing. However, the differences in their wording are rather minor, and the answers to both questions would be the same. First, let's look at the first question: \\"Why Spotify is not available in India?\\" This question has the subject (\\"Spotify\\") before the auxiliary verb (\\"is\\"), which might be considered less grammatically correct or less standard in English. It could be perceived as being more informal or colloquial. A native English speaker may understand the question but could possibly find it slightly awkward, as a more natural phrasing would be to place the auxiliary verb before the subject. Now let's examine the second question: \\"Why is Spotify not available in India?\\" In this version, the auxiliary verb comes before the subject (\\"is\\" before \\"Spotify\\") which results in a grammatically correct and standard question in English. This forms a correct interrogative sentence structure and would be the more natural phrasing for native English speakers. To summarize, although the questions are not the same in their phrasing, they both ask about the same topic, which is the unavailability of Spotify in India. The second question features a more standard and grammatically correct structure for posing this question in English, making it the more preferred choice.

That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution. Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper.

There, he is warned by a concerned lady against continuing his journey the following day. Harker believes that her concerns are rooted in peasant superstition. He ignores her, but starts to feel increasingly unnerved by the way everyone looks at him. Harker sets off for the rest of his journey and arrives at the Borgo Pass where he's picked up by the Count's mysterious coachman. Harker debarks at Castle Dracula, and the coach immediately rushes off. Somewhat hesitantly, Harker approaches the main door, whereupon a thin, tall, gaunt old man opens it.

Dracula explains, \\"This man belongs to me,\\" then gives the vampiresses a baby to feed on.

Harker soon realises he is a prisoner, and tries to escape by climbing out of his bedroom window. He finds his way back to the crypt where Count Dracula and his three brides rest in coffins.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Parts of a Neuron As you learned in the first section, the main part of a neuron is the cell body, which is also known as the soma (soma = “body”). The cell body contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles. But what makes neurons special is that they have many extensions of their cell membranes, which are generally referred to as processes. Neurons are usually described as having one, and only one, axon—a fiber that emerges from the cell body and projects to target cells. That single axon can branch repeatedly to communicate with many target cells. It is the axon that propagates the nerve impulse, which is communicated to one or more cells. The other processes of the neuron are dendrites, which receive information from other neurons at specialized areas of contact called synapses. The dendrites are usually highly branched processes, providing locations for other neurons to communicate with the cell body. Information flows through a neuron from the dendrites, across the cell body, and down the axon. This gives the neuron a polarity—meaning that information flows in this one direction. Figure 12.8 shows the relationship of these parts to one another. Q: Which part of a neuron contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles? A:","completion":"The cell body, also known as the soma, contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: 4 White Supremacists Face Federal Charges In California Attacks Enlarge this image toggle caption Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images Four Southern California men, allegedly part of a white supremacist group, have been charged by federal prosecutors for violent attacks on counterprotesters, journalists and a police officer at political rallies across the state. Three of the four are in custody. The New York Times reports that Robert Rundo, 28 was taken into custody on Sunday at the Los Angeles International Airport after fleeing to Central America earlier this month. Robert Boman, 25, and Tyler Laube, 22, were arrested Wednesday morning. Authorities are searching for the fourth man — Aaron Eason, 38. The criminal complaint, filed by the FBI out of Los Angeles on Saturday and unsealed on Wednesday, alleges the four are part of the white supremacist Rise Above Movement. RAM subscribes to a racist, anti-Semitic ideology and trains its members in combat. The group \\"represents itself publicly as a combat-ready, militant group of a new nationalist white supremacy/identity movement,\\" the complaint says. \\"The allegations describe an orchestrated effort to squelch free speech as members of the conspiracy traveled to multiple locations to attack those who hold different views,\\" said U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna in a news release. Videos recorded by journalists, bystanders and surveillance cameras, as well as posts on the Internet from the group's members and private social media communications between them, helped the Department of Justice build its case. The DOJ alleges the four men violated federal conspiracy and riot statutes in a series of incidents from March to June of 2017. At a Make America Great Again rally in Huntington Beach in March, the DOJ said in its criminal complaint, members of RAM attacked two journalists and a number of counterprotesters. Video footage shows Laube punched one journalist three times in the face, after the reporter was jostled by other rally attendees and stumbled backwards. The Daily Stormer — a neo-Nazi website and online community — praised the violence. \\"Front page of the stormer we did it fam,\\" one RAM member texted another. In the weeks after the attacks, members allegedly gleefully celebrated the attacks and recruited others to attend an upcoming rally in Berkeley, as well as a training session in hand-to-hand combat before the gathering. At that April rally, Rundo, Boman and Easaon assaulted people at the rally. Videos show group members with taped hands — like boxers — punching counterprotesters. In one attack, a RAM member held down a counterprotester while another landed punches. Rundo was arrested for punching a \\"defenseless person\\" and a police officer. \\"Total Aryan victory,\\" a RAM member texted another member the next day. RAM members again celebrated their assaults, according to the complaint. They posted photos of members holding up a banner celebrating they stole from counterprotesters. On social media, Boman posted several photos of himself attacking others and of RAM members engaged in combat training. In June, the white supremacists attended an \\"Anti-Islamic Law\\" rally in San Bernardino, where they carried out more attacks. Three RAM members not indicted in this case were arrested. Wednesday's charges follows the arrests earlier this month of another four RAM members — Benjamin Daley, Michael Miselis, Thomas Gillen and Cole White — who were charged on conspiracy to riot charges for attacking counterprotesters during last year's Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville, Va. The California charges describe connections between both sets of defendants. Between April and August of 2017, the complaint alleges, RAM members \\"engaged in regular combat training sessions\\" before attending the Unite the Right rally. They also \\"used the internet to coordinate combat training in preparation for the events, to arrange travel to the events, to coordinate attendance at the events, and to celebrate their acts of violence in order to recruit members for future events,\\" the complaint said. Members documented their extremist ideology in public Internet posts, including their affinity of the \\"14 words\\" — \\"a mantra known and used by white supremacy extremists and neo-Nazis,\\" FBI Special Agent Scott Bierwirth said in the complaint. Also according to the California affidavit, Rundo and two men charged in the Charlottesville case flew to Europe last spring to celebrate Adolf Hitler's birthday. There, they met with other white supremacy groups. ||||| WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. arrested the leader of a violent California neo-Nazi gang on a federal conspiracy charge after he fled the country earlier this month. Robert Rundo, 28, of Huntington Beach, Calif., is being held at the federal jail in downtown Los Angeles. He was charged in a criminal complaint that was unsealed Tuesday. Mr. Rundo apparently crossed into Mexico two weeks ago from California and then made his way to Central America. He was later brought back to the United States, where he was arrested Sunday at Los Angeles International Airport, according to two people familiar with the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. He is the founder of the Rise Above Movement, a neo-Nazi gang based in Southern California whose members were involved in violent activity at protests throughout California in 2017. He and three other Californians associated with the group — Robert Boman, 25, Tyler Laube, 22, and Aaron Eason, 38 — were charged with inciting riots, according to court documents. Mr. Boman and Mr. Laube were arrested on Tuesday morning in Southern California. The F.B.I. said it was still searching for Mr. Eason. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Robert Rundo was said to have been at the Charlottesville event last year that shocked the nation The leader of a white supremacist group based in California has been arrested and charged with inciting riots. Robert Rundo, co-founder of the Rise Above Movement, was arrested at LA International Airport on Sunday. Three others have also been charged, one of whom remains at large. The four are accused of travelling to events across California and to one in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year that led to the death of a woman and shocked the nation. Earlier this month, four other members of the Rise Above Movement were charged with attacking counter-protesters at the Unite the Right march in Charlottesville in August 2017. A woman died after a man drove into a crowd of counter-protesters. The New York Times says Mr Rundo, 28, had crossed into Mexico and was \\"brought back\\" to the United States to be arrested at LA airport. Fellow Rise Above Movement members Robert Boman, 25, and Tyler Laube, 22, were arrested on Wednesday while Aaron Eason, 38, remains at large. The US Attorney's Office alleges they acted with \\"intent to incite, organise, promote, encourage, participate in, or carry on riots\\". Three of the four, including Mr Rundo, are accused of attacking counter-protesters and journalists at a Make America Great Again rally in Huntington Beach, California, in March. Mr Rundo is alleged to have assaulted two protesters, while Mr Laube allegedly punched a journalist in the face.

Dietz's Indian heritage was first contested in 1916 after former neighbors who settled on the Pacific Coast heard he was posing as an Indian. In December 1918 the Federal Bureau of Investigation looked into his heritage after he fraudulently registered for the draft as a \\"Non-Citizen Indian\\" with an allotment. The Bureau found he had taken on the identity of James One Star, an Oglala man of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation 12 years his senior who had disappeared in Cuba in 1894. Dietz also claimed he was the head of an American film company that produced propaganda films for the war. Dietz divorced De Cora in November 1918, charging her with abandonment. It is not clear how much she knew about his true identity. She died six days after his indictment. Dietz was tried in Spokane, Washington in June 1919 for the first offense. One Star's sister, Sallie Eaglehorse, testified after seeing him for the first time at the trial that Dietz was definitely not her brother. Still, the judge instructed the jury to determine whether Dietz \\"believed\\" he was an Indian, not whether it was true. Despite that others had witnessed his birth in the summer of 1884 or had seen him the following day, Dietz's mother Leanna claimed he was the Indian son of her husband who had been switched a week or more after she had a stillbirth.

Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally).

Consult seniors, teachers, or online forums to find the most recommended materials. For Computer Science, popular authors and books include Cormen for Algorithms, Galvin for Operating Systems, and Tanenbaum for Computer Networks, among others. 3. Make a study schedule: Based on the time constraint of 3 or 5 months and the GATE syllabus, create a daily or weekly study schedule, assigning time for each subject and topic. Stick to the schedule as faithfully as possible and keep track of your progress. 4. Strengthen your basics: Focus on strengthening your fundamentals in each subject. Make sure to go through core concepts, definitions, and theorems, as GATE questions often test these aspects. In case of doubts, consult reliable sources or seek help from teachers and peers. 5. Practice problems: Solve a variety of problems from each topic, including previous years' GATE questions and problems from recommended books. This will help you develop a better understanding of the concepts and improve your problem-solving ability. 6. Test series and mock examinations: Join a reputed test series or attempt mock examinations in a timed environment. This will give you an idea of the actual examination process, help you improve your time management, and familiarize you with the online interface used in the GATE exam. 7. Analyze performance: After taking mock tests or solving practice problems, analyze your weaker and stronger areas. Work upon improving areas where you are facing difficulty and allocate more time to those subjects. 8. Revision: Periodically revise the topics you have covered. Make short notes or flashcards to help you with quick revisions. Consistently revising concepts ensures that the topics are fresh in your mind. 9. Stay motivated and positive: Stay focused, motivated, and maintain a positive attitude throughout your GATE preparation. Take breaks, eat healthily, and exercise regularly to stay mentally and physically fit. In conclusion, although the questions do not have exactly the same meaning, the approach to prepare for the GATE examination remains similar. Analyzing the time constraint and subject, planning, practicing, and being consistent in your efforts are the key takeaways for success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What two movements did the man who taught a variety of positions help influence toward the end of his life?, using the article: Lazar Markovich Lissitzky (Russian: Ла́зарь Ма́ркович Лиси́цкий, listen ; November 23 [O.S. November 11] 1890 – December 30, 1941), known as El Lissitzky (Russian: Эль Лиси́цкий, Yiddish: על ליסיצקי‎), was a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist and architect. He was an important figure of the Russian avant-garde, helping develop suprematism with his mentor, Kazimir Malevich, and designing numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union. His work greatly influenced the Bauhaus and constructivist movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate 20th-century graphic design.Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, \\"das zielbewußte Schaffen\\" (goal-oriented creation). Lissitzky, of Lithuanian Jewish оrigin, began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books in an effort to promote Jewish culture in Russia. When only 15 he started teaching, a duty he would maintain for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in a variety of positions, schools, and artistic media, spreading and exchanging ideas. He took this ethic with him when he worked with Malevich in heading the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed a variant suprematist series of his own, Proun, and further still in 1921, when he took up a job as the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany, working with and influencing important figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements during his stay. In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to typography, exhibition design, photomontage, and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design. This continued until his deathbed, where in 1941 he produced one of his last works – a Soviet propaganda poster rallying the people to construct more tanks for the fight against Nazi Germany. In 2014, the heirs of the artist, in..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","completion":"The two movements that the man who taught a variety of positions helped influence towards the end of his life were the Bauhaus and constructivist movements. El Lissitzky, a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist, and architect, played a significant role in the Russian avant-garde and contributed to the development of suprematism alongside his mentor, Kazimir Malevich. He designed numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union, and his work had a profound impact on both the Bauhaus and constructivist movements. Furthermore, he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that went on to dominate 20th-century graphic design. Throughout his career, Lissitzky held a strong belief that an artist could be an agent of change. He began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books to promote Jewish culture in Russia and started teaching at the age of 15, a responsibility he upheld for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in various positions, schools, and artistic media, sharing and exchanging ideas. Lissitzky brought this same work ethic with him when he collaborated with Malevich to lead the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed his own variant suprematist series called Proun, and further still in 1921, when he became the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany. During his time in Germany, he worked with and influenced significant figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements. In his remaining years, Lissitzky introduced significant innovation and change in the fields of typography, exhibition design, photomontage, and book design.

Сигариллы Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The word \\"Сигариллы\\" is a Russian word, which translates to \\"Cigarillos\\" in English. Cigarillos are small, thin cigars that have gained popularity in many parts of the world as a convenient, quick-smoking option compared to larger cigars. They are typically made of finely ground tobacco rolled inside of a tobacco leaf or a tobacco-based wrapper. Originating from Spain, cigarillos became popular in Europe and later in the Americas. Cigarillos come in various lengths, diameters, and flavors. Some cigarillos are flavored, such as vanilla, cherry, or chocolate, while others maintain the natural tobacco taste. They often come pre-cut at both ends, making them ready to smoke without any additional preparation. However, unlike regular cigars, cigarillos are not meant to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, but rather gently sipped and enjoyed for their taste and aroma. Cigarillos are the middle ground between cigarettes and traditional cigars, offering the convenience of a cigarette with the enjoyment of a quality cigar. Smoking a cigarillo usually takes around 15 to 30 minutes depending on the size, which is less time-consuming compared to regular cigars that can take an hour or more to smoke. While cigarillos are often considered less harmful than cigarettes due to the absence of added chemicals and filters, it is still important to remember that any form of tobacco smoking carries health risks. Thus, moderation and awareness are key when enjoying cigarillos or any other tobacco products."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Who was the first king of Rome?","completion":"The first king of Rome was Romulus, who, according to Roman mythology, founded the city itself in 753 BC and established its monarchy. The story of Romulus and Remus, his twin brother, is tied to the very origins of Rome, making it a combination of history and legend that has been passed down through generations for centuries. Romulus and Remus were the sons of Rhea Silvia and Mars, the god of war. Rhea Silvia was the daughter of Numitor, the king of Alba Longa, an ancient Latin city southeast of Rome. Numitor's younger brother, Amulius, seized the throne and forced Rhea Silvia to become a Vestal Virgin to prevent her from conceiving any potential heirs. However, Mars impregnated her, resulting in the birth of Romulus and Remus. Fearing for their survival, Rhea Silvia placed the twins in a basket and sent them down the River Tiber. The boys were discovered by a she-wolf, who had just lost her litter of cubs. She cared for the twins, nursing and protecting them until they were found by a shepherd named Faustulus and his wife, Acca Larentia. The couple took the boys in and raised them as their own. As the twins grew older, they learned of their true heritage and their connection to the royal family of Alba Longa. They decided to overthrow their great-uncle Amulius and restore Numitor to the throne. After accomplishing this, Romulus and Remus set out to establish their city. However, a dispute arose between the two about where they should build their new city. Romulus wanted it to be on the Palatine Hill, while Remus supported the Aventine Hill. They sought the opinion of the gods through augury, a form of divination that involved observing the movements of birds. Each brother saw a different number of birds and claimed victory, which led to an escalation of their disagreement. The conflict between the brothers reached its peak when Remus, in an act of defiance, jumped over the wall Romulus had built around the city. In response, Romulus killed his brother and assumed complete control of the city's founding, naming it after himself. As the first king of Rome, Romulus established various social, legal, and military structures that would come to define the city and its culture. He created an army and a senate, granting lifelong positions to noble families who supported him. To increase the population of Rome, Romulus welcomed outcasts from surrounding areas, including criminals and refugees. Moreover, he helped facilitate marriages between Roman men and the abducted women of a neighboring tribe, the Sabines, to integrate the tribes and expand his kingdom. Romulus ruled for approximately 37 years until he mysteriously disappeared in a storm (circa 716 BC), an event that some believed signaled his ascension to the status of a deity. Regardless of the veracity of this account, the legacy of Romulus is fondly remembered and revered in Roman mythology and history as the founder and first king of Rome."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What does the genotype cause? Context: The existence of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2n combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.

Hypothesis: The secretary dismissed the bill.","completion":"Step 1: Identify the key elements of the context. From the provided context, the key elements are: - The parliamentary secretary did a fantastic job - The bill went through the House and committee - The filibuster by the Reform Party tried to hinder the bill - The Reform Party does not want to see labor legislation advance in parliament Step 2: Analyze the key elements to determine if they support or contradict the hypothesis. The hypothesis is: \\"The secretary dismissed the bill.\\" - The fact that the parliamentary secretary did a fantastic job suggests that the secretary was actively working on the bill and not dismissing it. - The bill going through the House and committee shows progress and indicates that it was not dismissed. - The filibuster by the Reform Party tried to hinder the bill, not the secretary. - The Reform Party's opposition to labor legislation is unrelated to the secretary's actions regarding the bill. Step 3: Conclusion Based on the analysis, there is no evidence in the context to support the hypothesis that the secretary dismissed the bill. Instead, the context suggests that the secretary worked hard to advance the bill despite opposition.

Given the question: Information: - William Clark Gable (February 1, 1901 November 16, 1960) was an American film actor, often referred to as \\"The King of Hollywood\\" or just simply as \\"The King\\". Gable began his career as a stage actor and appeared as an extra in silent films between 1924 and 1926, and progressed to supporting roles with a few films for MGM in 1931. The next year, he landed his first leading Hollywood role and became a leading man in more than 60 motion pictures over the next three decades. - Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly such that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. Hollywood's classical film noir period is generally regarded as extending from the early 1940s to the late 1950s. Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography. Many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Great Depression. - The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) is a drama school in London, England. It is one of the oldest drama schools in the United Kingdom, founded in 1904 by Herbert Beerbohm Tree. - Oliver Burgess Meredith (November 16, 1907 September 9, 1997), was an American actor, director, producer, and writer in theater, film, and television.

Please briefly summarize this news article: GM learns from Toyota how not to handle a crisis has wanted to be more like It wanted to sell more passenger cars like Toyota. It wanted Toyota's reputation for reliability. But in one area, GM is doing everything it can to not be like Toyota. As federal safety officials began investigating the cause of fires that followed test crashes of its Chevrolet Volt electric vehicles, GM shifted into communications overdrive, trotting out senior executives and engineers to talk about the issue and launching a customer-care initiative. Analysts say the Detroit automaker wants to be sure it is not seen as sitting on its hands and downplaying a safety issue — a trap Toyota fell into after a deadly 2009 car crash killed four people and set off fears of sudden uncontrolled acceleration in Toyota and Lexus vehicles. Toyota responded slowly and ineffectually to the growing crisis because it was hampered by a top-down management style that gave short shrift to customer complaints, according to a report by a special Toyota advisory panel in May. GM moved quickly to allay customer fears, said Eric Noble, president of the CarLab, an industry consulting firm in Orange. GM said any Volt owner concerned about safety could borrow a free GM vehicle until the issue is resolved. So far, \\"only a handful\\" of Volt owners have requested loaner vehicles, the automaker said. \\"This is a smart move on GM's part,\\" Noble said, \\"because the total exposure to GM is infinitesimal if you think about the small number of Volts that are out there on the road.\\" The company also is not afraid to talk publicly about the fires. Mark Reuss, the president of GM's North American operations, and Mary Barra, the company's senior vice president of global product development, held a telephone news conference Monday to explain their understanding of the problem, noting that the fires occurred only in test situations up to three weeks after the crashes and that there have been no reports of spontaneous fires or blazes started by collisions. They said GM has \\"a senior engineering team\\" working on \\"changes to eliminate concern of potential post-crash electrical fires.\\" It also is working with the to discover the source of the problem. GM said the fires can be prevented by draining all electricity from the battery before storing the damaged vehicle. (Safety officials drain gas from conventional vehicles destroyed in crashes to prevent fires.) To be sure, fires caused by batteries in electric vehicles weeks after a crash test aren't nearly as severe a crisis as what Toyota faced, but GM and the rest of the auto industry want to avoid being seen as unresponsive. \\"Toyota was studying its problem and tried to determine what the problem was, but they kept studying and didn't communicate,\\" said Jeremy Anwyl, chief executive of auto information company Edmunds.com. \\"And what the automakers learned is that in today's world that's not always good. You have to communicate before you have all the facts.\\" The lesson applies to any manufacturer of a consumer product, especially if there is a safety issue. \\"The expectations around candor and transparency are awfully high,\\" Anwyl said. GM appears to be following an old Toyota playbook. Soon after launching its Lexus luxury brand in 1989, Toyota received one complaint of a cruise-control-switch malfunction and learned of an incident in which the lens on a high-mount brake light melted. Fearful that reports of the problems would damage its efforts to portray Lexus as a brand with industry-leading quality, Toyota issued a of about 8,000 LS 400 vehicles in its initial sales. Toyota had Lexus dealers deliver loaners to people's homes, repaired the recalled cars and returned them washed, detailed and with a full tank of gas, according to \\"Satisfaction: How Every Great Company Listens to the Voice of the Customer\\" by Chris Denove and James D. Power IV. Anwyl said the incident became the \\"textbook example of how to handle a recall. People were wowed by how Lexus would go the extra mile.\\"","completion":"General Motors (GM) has learned from Toyota's mistakes in handling crises by taking quick action and maintaining open communication with customers regarding the safety investigation of its Chevrolet Volt electric vehicles. After test crashes caused fires in the vehicles, GM proactively addressed the issue, offering Volt owners a free loaner vehicle and assigning a senior engineering team to work on solutions. This quick response contrasts with Toyota's slow and ineffective reaction to the sudden acceleration problem in 2009 that resulted in customer complaints and a severely damaged reputation. Analysts argue that proper communication and transparency are essential when facing safety issues, as seen in GM's successful handling of the situation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: In many cases, you can allow the pregnancy to proceed normally, but make sure you have a vet on hand in case there are complications, which are more likely if your pig is older or younger or has not given birth previously. Try to find a vet who specializes in rodents and other small animals, rather than just a generic vet. If you have multiple sows, remove the male pig immediately to prevent others from becoming pregnant. Even if this is the only sow you own, you should still remove the male pig before she reaches 60 days in her pregnancy. It is best to house the male in an adjacent cage where he can still be close to the female. A male guinea pig who can not see or hear his mate may develop stress, making him susceptible to illness. Male guinea pigs will continue to mount pregnant sows, which can cause stress or pain to your pregnant sow late in the pregnancy (after the 50-day mark). She could also become pregnancy just two hours after she gives birth. You'll want to make sure your pig is getting sufficient food, water, and nutrients since these things are also helping the fetuses develop. Feed your guinea pig alfalfa hay instead of timothy hay so that she gets more protein and calcium. Your pregnant sow will also need more vitamin C after 4 weeks, about twice as much, so incorporate more fresh fruits and vegetables high in vitamin C into her diet. In addition, you may want to increase your guinea pig's fiber intake. Increased fiber intake can prevent hair thinning, which is common in the last stage of pregnancy. You should weigh your guinea pig twice a week to make sure that is gaining weight (and not losing it) and is generally healthy (e.g., eating all her food, still social and interactive, etc.) and check she's healthy. If at any point her weight begins to fall or if she begins to show signs of illness, consult a vet immediately. Try to make your guinea pig's life follow a routine so as to minimize stress, which can aggravate the dangers that accompany guinea pig pregnancy. Avoid making changes to a pregnant sow's cage, like removing toys or putting the cage in a totally new location. This could increase her stress and affect her eating and drinking habits. Reduce her exposure to loud noises or bright lights, including direct sunlight. Reduce handling to a minimum and don't handle her within two weeks of the birth. Note that the gestation period is usually 66 - 72 days.","completion":"When a guinea pig is pregnant, it is important to take care of her well. Make sure to check on her with a special animal doctor, called a vet, who knows about small animals. Keep the dad guinea pig away from the mom after 60 days, but still close by so they won't get sad or sick. Give the mom guinea pig more good food, like alfalfa hay and fruits and vegetables with lots of vitamin C. Check her weight and health often, and ask the vet for help if she's not doing well. Keep her life very calm and avoid making big changes, so she won't feel stressed. Be very gentle with her and let her be more on her own close to when the babies are coming. The babies will be born after about 66 to 72 days."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Article: An Army wife filed a lawsuit against the government on Monday, claiming that her opera career is in jeopardy after an Army nurse botched her childbirth operation. According to a report by Army Times, Amy Herbst and her husband allege that a nurse-midwife at Blanchfield Army Community Hospital at Fort Campbell, Ky., caused significant damage to Herbst’s digestive and reproductive system’s during the birth of her son in February 2012. The lawsuit claims that the nurse performed an episiotomy during the second stage of Herbst’s labor without the new mom’s consent or knowledge. An episiotomy is an incision that a doctor or nurse makes in the perineum – the area between the vagina and anus – to help deliver a baby that is in distress or to prevent muscles from tearing. The nurse-midwife reportedly repaired the episiotomy with sutures, but after Herbst left the hospital, she “began to experience fecal urgency and incontinence, including periodic leaking of stool and excessive flatulence,” the suit states. Herbst claims that upon returning to the hospital, another nurse told her that attempts to repair the cut had been unsuccessful, and a colorectal surgeon told her she would need reconstructive surgery to fix the damage. Because of the complications of the procedure, Herbst says she is unable to continuing working as a professional opera singer at the Nashville Opera Company. “She is suffering though a very embarrassing and very significant injury, and frankly, the prognosis of a fully successful repair is pretty low,” Herbst’s attorney, Charles Allen, told Army Times. When asked by Army Times for a comment on the pending lawsuit, a spokesperson for Blanchfield declined to remark on the specific case. However, the spokesperson said that the hospital is deeply concerned with its patients’ outcomes. “The Blanchfield Army Community Hospital staff always strives to provide high quality, safe and accessible health care that fully complies with all applicable standards of care,” the spokesperson said.

Step 2: First, simplify the equation. Anything multiplied by zero is zero, so 0*h equals 0. Now, our equation looks like this: 0 = 4*h - 16. Step 3: Next, make 4*h - 16 equal to 0 because from our previous step, we have the equation 0 = 4*h - 16, from which we can easily isolate the term with h. So, 4*h - 16 = 0. Step 4: To isolate h, we should first move the -16 (the constant on the left side) to the right by adding 16 to both sides of the equation. When we do so, our equation becomes: 4*h = 16. Step 5: Finally, to get h alone, we need to cancel out the multiplication of 4. Since the opposite operation of multiplication is division, we divide both sides by 4: 4*h/4 = 16/4, h = 4.

John coughed himself awake on the bank of the lake where he and Bill had their play. How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence? Select from: (i) unacceptable. (ii) acceptable.","completion":"I would consider the linguistic integrity of the given sentence as acceptable. Here's an analysis of why: The structure of the sentence is relatively straightforward. It consists of two clauses, which combine together to present ideas that are both coherent and logically connected. Mentions of the two characters, the main action, and the location effectively set up the scene for the reader. The clause \\"John coughed himself awake on the bank of the lake\\" is particularly interesting due to the use of the reflexive pronoun \\"himself\\" which highlights that John's coughing eventually led to his awakening. This combination of coughing and waking up has an underlying sense of cause-and-effect and creates a vivid imagery for readers, engaging their interest. The second clause \\"where he and Bill had their play\\" provides further context, specifying the location of the scene. Clarifying the characters' relationship as companions and playmates, it conveys the idea that John and Bill were engaging in some form of activity by the lakeside before the described event took place. The variety in sentence structure - in this case, a combination of the two clauses - works well to keep the readers engaged while ensuring the information is conveyed effectively. No grammatical errors can be identified in the given sentence. Therefore, the linguistic integrity can be considered acceptable due to the overall success in the arrangement of words and phrases to convey a clear scene to the reader."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The answer is:","completion":"- is standing in front of table with spectators behind her. The other answers are wrong because: - The option about the hot screen and high-speed words doesn't make sense for a young table tennis player, as it is unrelated to playing table tennis. - The one about talking on stage with cheers and claps might be confusing, but it’s about the man in gray long sleeves, not the young table tennis player. - The last option is incorrect because it mentions the player talking and shaking her racquet, but it is unclear how it connects to the man in gray long sleeves or the stage of ultimate Guinness World Records."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"sympathetic\\" to \\"stern\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two i.e. the trigger word/phrase. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For your question, PersonY should be a well-agreed answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people or generic names (e.g., Donald Trump, John Doe, etc.) in your question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question.

Example: PersonX wanted to remove trees in his front yard unlike PersonY because _ likes to live in an enclosed space. Explanation: I replaced \\"plant\\" with \\"remove\\" to flip the roles of PersonX and PersonY in the situation, making PersonY the one preferring an enclosed space. Part #2: Ensure PersonY is a well-agreed answer. Usage: Make sure PersonY is the correct choice given the context. Example: PersonX wanted to remove trees in his front yard unlike PersonY because _ likes to live in an enclosed space. Explanation: In this case, PersonY is the one who likes living in an enclosed space, which is well supported by the context. Part #3: Avoid potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Usage: Keep the content appropriate for all audiences. Example: PersonX wanted to remove trees in his front yard unlike PersonY because _ likes to live in an enclosed space. Explanation: This example is free from explicit, offensive, or adult content. Part #4: Do not use the names of real people or generic names. Usage: Use placeholders for the persons involved. Example: PersonX wanted to remove trees in his front yard unlike PersonY because _ likes to live in an enclosed space.

You are given a new situation: Two brothers have a piece of land each, situated 2 miles from each other. Jim's land is not very fertile because it has clay soil with a high pH, while Bob's land has very fertile soil and has a good productivity on it. and a hint : Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils. Alkaline soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline. Please answer this question : Which of the two pieces of land is more acidic? Answer:","completion":"To determine which piece of land is more acidic, we need to compare the pH levels of the soils present on Jim's and Bob's lands. We know that Jim's land has clay soil with a high pH (> 8.5). The hint provided about alkali or alkaline soils also states that they have high pH levels (> 8.5). This implies that Jim's land is alkaline, and since the pH is above 7 (neutral), it is basic, not acidic. On the other hand, Bob's land has very fertile soil and good productivity. While we don't have an exact pH value, it is reasonable to infer that the soil on Bob's land is not alkaline, as alkaline soils have poor structure and low infiltration capacity. This means that the pH of Bob's soil could be closer to neutral (pH 7) or acidic (pH < 7).

Amal tells Tarek she is pregnant but he gives her an ultimatum - abandon the country with him, or have an abortion.Amal, who loves Tarek and wants the baby, rejects both choices. But when the battered scooter she uses for food deliveries is stolen. Amal is fired from her job and suddenly finds herself with even fewer options. Her future, limited from the start, looks even more uncertain.

Her sister, Hanan, is also an unwed mother with few paths to a better life.Her best friend, Rania, is trying to raise money for an operation that will disguise the fact that she is no longer a virgin so that she can marry an wealthy, older man whom she does not love.

The new job opens up the underworld life within Cairo that Amal never imagined - a life of luxury, leisure, expensive homes and cars - but also one of vice.

For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body. Now, I have a new situation: The Jones family went jogging last Saturday. The weather was great for running, a bit chilly. The Brown family went jogging on Sunday and the weather was hot and humid, so it was tough for them, plus they forgot their Gatorade at home. Answer this question please: Which family experienced more nausea?","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the Brown family experienced more nausea while jogging due to the hot and humid weather conditions. While running, their bodies would have been producing increased amounts of sweat to cool down, which can lead to electrolyte loss. As mentioned, early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatigue, and dizziness. Since the weather conditions were more challenging for the Brown family and they forgot to bring their Gatorade, which is a sports drink that could have helped replenish their electrolytes, their risk of experiencing symptoms related to electrolyte loss, including nausea, would have been higher than the Jones family. In comparison, the Jones family jogged in cooler weather conditions, which would have resulted in less sweating and therefore less risk of electrolyte loss. As a result, the chances of the Jones family experiencing nausea due to electrolyte deficiency would likely have been lower than the Brown family in this situation. It is important to note that while this answer is based on the provided context, individual exercise tolerance, overall health, and personal fitness levels could also be factors affecting the experience of nausea. Additionally, other factors, such as food intake or hydration before the jogging activity, could also play a role in determining the risk of nausea in each family; however, these factors were not mentioned in the given context. Overall, based on the information available, it can be reasonably assumed that the Brown family experienced more nausea during their jogging session."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine.

Fifteen months after surviving, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but trouble starts again when he substitutes an unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of \\"Kappin' Off Suckers\\" (K.O.S.). Their leader, Benito \\"Benny\\" ChacÃ³n, a felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect. The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats. After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he disappears, and Benny's unstable tag partner, CÃ©sar, takes over as leader. When CÃ©sar steals Garfield's family heirloom watch, the principal is more concerned about a lawsuit and refuses to take action. Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but is stymied by Garfield's destabilizing behavior and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield's past garners the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress, an alcoholic history teacher who carries guns at the school. The conflict between Garfield and the K.O.S. escalates with the killing of Jack, Ellen's dog. CÃ©sar, after spraying cartoon graffiti depicting a dead dog, is shot with a syringe filled with morphine attached to the end of an arrow. He passes out, and wakes up to find one...

While it’s cliché to infer they have motor oil coursing through their veins, their interest in all things vehicular run much deeper than the mere act of getting from one location to another. If that describes your dear old dad, here’s a look at a few can’t-miss gifts that are guaranteed to make his heart race this Father’s Day: • One way to get dad’s hard-working hands on an exotic sports car for a fraction of the cost is to upgrade his or her computer mouse with a racier model, a Porsche 911 to be exact. The Motormouse is a 2.4g wireless mouse that’s a strikingly detailed replica of the iconic coupe. Both PC and Mac compatible, it comes in five colors for 50 from www.motormouse.us.com. MINI Cooper versions are also available. • Whatever dad drives you can upgrade it to at least sound like a Ferrari, thanks to the Soundracer. This device plugs into a 12-volt power point and replicates a sports car engine’s roar through the car’s audio system via a built in FM transmitter. And it does so in perfect sync with the vehicle’s actual accelerations and decelerations. It also doubles as an audio adapter for MP3 players. Offered in V8 and V10-engine versions, it’s available at select auto accessory retailers for 40. (www.soundracer.se) • Those dads who like to – literally – wear their affection for autos on their sleeves will enjoy a pair of car-themed cufflinks that run the gamut from shift knobs, tires, spark plugs and dashboard gauges to headlamps and road signs. A selection of 32 sets range in price from 45 to 425/pair from www.cufflinks.com (many are also sold at Nordstrom, Saks, Neiman Marcus and other retailers. • Ideal for a dad who’s both an auto enthusiast and is environmentally conscious is Green Earth Technologies Car Care Kit. It consists of five eco-friendly products made from plant oils: organic glass cleaner, brake dust shield, hydrophobic car wash, tire shine and wheel cleaner. Widely available, it retails for 20. (www.getg.com) • Leading the race to build a better travel mug is the aptly named Brugo, which is designed to eliminate both spills and scalded lips. A “tip and cool” mode allows users to transfer small amounts of too-hot take-out beverages to a temperature-controlled chamber, where it cools down a gulp at a time to a “perfect” 150 to 170 degrees. Once the beverage has cooled to a palatable temperature, dad can switch the Brugo into “sip” mode and drink it directly. Offered in “Executive,” “Jazz” and “Sport” versions, Brugo mugs are available nationwide for 15 and 20. (www.brugomug.com) • Making driving safer and more convenient is the Belkin Tunebase with Hands-Free, which allows iPhone and iPod Touch owners to conduct hands-free conversations through their car stereo systems. Sold through electronics retailers, the 70 “Direct” version connects through an auxiliary audio input jack (found on later model cars), while the 100 “FM” model transmits to an unused FM radio station. It also streams music stored on the iPhone/iPod and allows users to charge up to two mobile devices while en route. A unique cradle design allows easy operation. (www.belkin.com) • Another hands-free calling adapter – this one using Bluetooth wireless connectivity – can additionally help prevent dad from losing his cellphone. The diminutive ZOMM attaches to a keychain and essentially acts as a “wireless leash” that will flash, vibrate and even sound an alarm if an owner walks away from his or her phone. It also includes a panic button to call local emergency services and send help to the phone’s location via an automatic message. It’s available in either black or white directly from the manufacturer or at electronics dealers for 100.

Question: \\"Why did Cubitt build the new wing?\\" Context: \\"By 1847, the couple had found the palace too small for court life and their growing family, and consequently the new wing, designed by Edward Blore, was built by Thomas Cubitt, enclosing the central quadrangle. The large East Front, facing The Mall, is today the \\"public face\\" of Buckingham Palace, and contains the balcony from which the royal family acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions and after the annual Trooping the Colour. The ballroom wing and a further suite of state rooms were also built in this period, designed by Nash's student Sir James Pennethorne.\\" Answer:","completion":"Thomas Cubitt was commissioned to build the new wing at Buckingham Palace in the mid-19th century for several reasons. The primary reason was the lack of space and the need for expansion, as the palace had become too small for the growing family of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, as well as for the demands of daily court life. Additionally, the desire to have a more impressive and functional palace for hosting important events and accommodating state guests also played a key role in the decision to build a new wing. The existing palace structure, despite the prior renovations and expansions by architects such as John Nash and Edward Blore, was still insufficient for the needs and expectations of the British monarchy. The new wing was designed by Edward Blore, an architect with significant experience in designing royal buildings, and was constructed by Thomas Cubitt, a well-respected builder who had achieved great success through his innovative techniques and high-quality materials. The new wing built by Cubitt enclosed the central quadrangle of the palace and greatly expanded its available space. It allowed for the creation of the large East Front which faces The Mall, a famous landmark in central London. This facade has become the \\"public face\\" of Buckingham Palace and now serves as the primary entrance for official state visits and other important events. The balcony on the East Front is used by the royal family to acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions, such as after weddings, the birth of a new family member, or national celebrations. Additionally, the expansion allowed for the inclusion of the much-needed ballroom wing and further suite of state rooms, designed by Sir James Pennethorne, a student of John Nash. This addition of grand, beautifully appointed spaces enabled the palace to host lavish state banquets, royal receptions, and other significant gatherings. The improved facilities greatly increased the palace's capacity to accommodate important guests and reinforced its status as the epicenter of British royal residence and official functions. In conclusion, Thomas Cubitt was commissioned to build the new wing at Buckingham Palace in response to the growing needs of the British royal family and the requirements of maintaining the monarchy's status and image. The construction of the new wing expanded the available space within the palace, providing additional state rooms, a grand ballroom, and the iconic East Front with its balcony for the royal family to interact with the public on special occasions. This expansion played a crucial role in shaping Buckingham Palace into the iconic symbol of British royalty and national pride that it is today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: The lady is thinking about getting some photos developed at the store she is walking near. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"It is not possible to definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true based solely on the premise provided. The premise merely states that a woman wearing an orange shirt is walking past a 1-hour photo shop. This statement does not provide enough information to infer any conclusions about her thoughts or intentions with certainty. In order to evaluate the hypothesis, we need more data or evidence that can provide context to her action. To understand why we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true, let us break down the information available in the premise: 1. A woman is walking. 2. She is wearing an orange shirt. 3. She is passing by a 1-hour photo shop. These pieces of information do not inherently suggest any correlation between the woman's attire (orange shirt), her location (proximity to a photo shop), and her intentions (thinking about getting photos developed). The premise does not mention any action or behavior on the woman's part that could directly link her to the store or the activity of photo development, such as looking in the store window, holding a camera or a roll of film, or conversing with someone about photography. Furthermore, there could be several alternative explanations for the woman's actions. She could be out for a leisurely stroll, on her way to meet someone, or perhaps just walking past the photo shop coincidentally, with no intention of getting photos developed. The color of her shirt has no bearing on her objectives and serves merely as a descriptor; it does not provide any additional information that could strengthen the hypothesis. In conclusion, we cannot verify the hypothesis that the lady is thinking about getting photos developed at the store she is walking near, based solely on the premise provided. To conclusively prove or disprove the hypothesis, we would require more concrete evidence, such as a direct statement of intent from the woman, observable actions linking her to the store or photo development, or any other related contextual information.

Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). and the situation: Geologists have been contemplating on the question - why some places are more susceptible to earthquakes. To understand the differences, they have made a chart where they divided the earth into two regions, region A and region B. In region A many earthquakes happen, but in region B no earthquakes happen. Answer the following question: In which region stresses would not build in plates, region A or region B? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given background information and the situation presented, region B is the region where stresses would not build in plates or at least not to the extent seen in region A. As mentioned in the background, almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, and all types of plate boundaries can experience earthquakes. This is due to the convection within Earth's mantle, which causes the tectonic plates to move. The movement of these plates leads to stress building up at the plate boundaries, and when the stress becomes too much for the rocks to handle, they break, releasing a sudden burst of energy in the form of an earthquake. In the given scenario, region A experiences many earthquakes, indicating a high level of stress building up at the plate boundaries within this region. This is typical for areas located along active plate boundaries where extensive tectonic activity results in regular earthquakes. On the other hand, region B does not experience any earthquakes, which suggests that the stresses within the plates in this region do not build up to the point of causing earthquakes. This could be due to several factors, such as the presence of weak or inactive plate boundaries that do not generate significant stress or a more stable geological setting with slower tectonic movements that prevent stress from accumulating beyond the rocks' breaking point. It is essential to note that, while region B does not experience earthquakes in the given situation, this does not necessarily mean that the region's plates never experience any stress. Instead, it suggests that the stress levels within the plates in region B may not exceed the breaking point of the rocks, or that any stress buildup dissipates more slowly and more consistently over time, preventing the occurrence of earthquakes. In conclusion, based on the information provided, region B is the area where stresses would not build in the plates or would build at a much slower and less dangerous rate compared to region A. It is important to remember, however, that Earth's geology is complex and continuously changing, and this is a simplified analysis of the situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The tests are designed to identify sleep apnoea, a condition that causes people to stop breathing during sleep. One patient told the BBC the problem was so acute it had driven her to contemplate suicide. \\"At one stage, my life was so awful because of how little sleep I was getting that I wanted to kill myself,\\" Carole Bennett, from Leeds, said. \\"When I got tested for sleep apnoea the doctors found that whilst I was asleep, I'd stop breathing 27 times in just one hour.\\" Josie Beatson, from Sheffield, said that before receiving treatment for her sleep apnoea, the condition had a terrible impact on her life. She said: \\"It's embarrassing to be at work and have your colleagues wake you up because they can hear you snoring. \\"The condition turned me into a recluse. I was so exhausted all the time that I didn't want to socialise, and because of my loud snoring I was too embarrassed to go and sleep at anyone else's house.\\" Sleep apnoea is the most common sleep disorder, according to the NHS. It is caused when the muscles and soft tissue in the throat relax, causing a blockage of the airways. The lack of oxygen to the brain causes those with the condition to wake up or have regular interruptions to their sleep. Common symptoms include loud snoring or gasping and grunting whilst asleep. Those with the condition usually manage it by wearing an oxygen mask at night, or other oral devices that keep the airways open. Many are encouraged to lose weight and in some cases people can undergo surgery to remove excess tissue in their passageways. Analysing data collected by NHS England, the BBC has found the number of sleeping disorder tests has increased every year over the past decade. NHS South Sefton in Liverpool had the highest rate of sleep diagnostic tests being commissioned last year. Doctors attribute the rise in the number of sleep tests to a greater sense of public awareness about the wider health implications of not getting enough sleep. \\"Sleep apnoea is a serious condition which can lead to other problems such as high blood pressure, which in turn can lead to strokes and heart attacks,\\" said Dr Stephen Bianchi from Sheffield's Northern General Hospital. It is estimated that about 1.5 million people in the UK suffer from the condition, although doctors warn many people will have never been formally diagnosed. \\"We think about 2% of females, and 4% of males in the UK have significant sleep apnoea. However, we suspect that 80% of those with the condition are unaware they have it,\\" Dr Bianchi added. Consultants at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust have been pioneering new ways of treating a range of sleep disorders. Patients with sleep apnoea are often tested for neurological sleep conditions such as insomnias and rapid eye movement (REM) disorders. Iain Gordon, from Doncaster, has an REM behaviour disorder, which sees him physically act out his dreams when he's asleep. \\"If I have a dream that I'm fighting crocodiles or jumping off a cliff, I will shout and kick out. \\"But the reason why I've now sought help is because there have been instances recently where I've hit my wife whilst I've been asleep.\\" Dr Gary Dennis, from the Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, said sleep disorders could have \\"wide and unpredictable\\" outcomes. One sleep disorder sufferer, Brian Thomas from Neath in south Wales, killed his wife during a violent nightmare and was told by a judge he \\"bore no responsibility\\". \\"REM disorders are not inconsequential,\\" said Dr Dennis. \\"At one end of the spectrum I've had the spouses of my patients who have needed dental work because they've been hit by their bed partner. But then at the other end I've had patients who have managed to drive themselves to the petrol station while they've been asleep.\\" Clinicians like Dr Dennis believe people need to pay more attention to their own \\"sleep hygiene\\" including diet, lifestyle and cutting down on late-night phone and tablet use. \\"These devices emit blue light and there is a clear association between using these devices late at night and then having poor amounts of sleep,\\" he said. \\"Put simply lots of people think sleep gets in the way of life, but I see it the other way round. You can get more out of life, by getting more sleep.\\" Viewers in Yorkshire can see more about this story on BBC Look North at 1830 on BBC One on Tuesday 20 June, or afterwards on BBC iPlayer.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Ukip suspends general secretary over ‘candidate selection allegations’ The UK Independence party has suspended its general secretary in relation to alleged “impropriety” over candidate selection, even though he was selected to run for the party in a London consitutency less than two weeks ago. Roger Bird, who has been a senior Ukip official since July, said told the Guardian he could not discuss an “ongoing process” but there were no criminal allegations involved. In a statement, Ukip said: “Shortly after a claim came to light about the conduct of Mr Bird with regard to candidate selection, the UK Independence party took action swiftly and decisively, including steps involving external human resources consultants, as well as following due process and the party’s constitution to the letter. “Unfortunately, Ukip has had to suspend Mr Bird pending a full investigation into allegations made against him. The party has acted swiftly and decisively and will not tolerate impropriety of any kind amongst its staff.” In the absence of explanation, it is unclear whether the allegations related to his time as party secretary, his previous role as chairman of Ukip presiding over selections in the south-east of England, or his recent selection as a candidate for the seat of Cities of London and Westminster. It was initially thought Bird was the general election candidate in Mole Valley in Surrey, but the local branch chairman confirmed to the Guardian that he had resigned from that position last year and was selected for the London seat currently held by Tory MP Mark Field in late November. The party has recently been under scrutiny over the way some local candidates have been deselected potentially to make way for bigger names. Bird was involved in at least one of these controversies, as he told the Portsmouth News that the removal of Douglas Denny in Portsmouth South was a “routine event”. However, the senior official’s suspension is not thought to be related to this row. Bird’s LinkedIn page says he has been general secretary of the party since July 2014 and was previously a finance director and auditor.","completion":"The UK Independence Party (UKIP) has suspended its general secretary, Roger Bird, due to alleged impropriety over candidate selection.

Cowboy builder Danny Shea, pictured, conned home-owners out of more than £2million by failing to complete work on their properties, including leaving one a roofless shell. A cowboy builder conned home-owners out of more than £2million by failing to complete work on their properties, including leaving one a roofless shell. Danny Shea removed the roof of one bungalow and left it an uninhabitable shell, but never completed the work, leaving the couple living in a caravan in the garden. Now the 48-year-old is behind bars after he was handed a five and a half year jail term for his crimes. Shea, of Bordon, Hampshire, was sentenced at Winchester Crown Court after pleading guilty to nine fraud charges and one of fraudulent trading. The offences involved homes in the Thursley, Chiddingfold, Tadworth and Chertsey areas of Surrey and Farnborough, Bordon and Grayshott in Hampshire, between 2007 and 2010. The South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (Serocu), which investigated Shea, found that the 48-year-old had carried out renovations and rebuilding worth £2.1 million which was not completed. Victims Martin Wells and his wife lost about £150,000 in payments to Shea, whom they employed to renovate their bungalow in Grayshott. Mr Wells said Shea ripped off the roof of his property but never returned to finish the job leaving him and his wife to live in a caravan through two winters,' Mr Wells told the BBC. 'As the weeks went by, there was not much work being done, no materials were arriving on site. 'I would be on the phone to Shea every day, sometimes several times a day. \\"When is the timber arriving? When are the bricks arriving?\\" He would always have a very plausible excuse. 'We were stuck in the caravan with a house with no roof on it. 'We were stupid to the extent that we gave him money. We probably lost £150,000 but we got to a stage where we had to believe this was going to happen.' Detective Sergeant Ian Ball said: 'For three years Shea systematically defrauded customers who engaged him to carry out building work. 'He claimed to be going to carry out work to a proper standard and finish the respective jobs. ' 'In fact he had no intention of doing either. After an original down-payment, he would obtain further money, again with no intention of doing the work properly or sometimes at all. The bungalow owned by Martin Wells in Grayshott, Hampshire, before work was started on the roof by cowboy builder Danny Shea. And this was the state of the Wells' bungalow after Danny Shea had failed to finish the job having removed the roof. The couple were forced to live in a caravan in the garden through two winters and lost tens of thousands of pounds. 'He would provide an initial quote, followed by a request for money upfront for labour and materials. 'He would provide references from customers satisfied with early work on their projects and suggested extra work which could be carried out. 'Further requests for payment would be made but work would slow and stop. There would be re-negotiation but by then the victims were sucked in and just wanted to have the work finished so would agree to the new demands and even pay suppliers direct for materials. 'Shea would meanwhile make token efforts at work just to keep them on the hook. Then he would disappear, leaving unfinished and sub-standard work. 'The cost of remedial work sometimes ran into hundreds of thousands of pounds. 'However, working with partners in many agencies and with the CPS, we were able to support the victims and get the evidence that finally enabled us to bring Shea to justice after an investigation that has now spanned three years.' The fraudulent trading related to theft of plant and construction machinery and motor vehicles, which had been unlawfully sold. Equipment worth more than £121,000 is still unaccounted for.

I hated the first episode of this show ( 'Protesting Hippies' ) so much in 1999 that I shunned the rest. However, when it came on 'The Paramount Comedy Channel' I watched it in full and, to my surprise, found it absolutely hilarious ( Motto: never judge a comedy series in its first week )! Set in 1969, 'Hippies' stars Simon Pegg as 'Ray Purbbs', editor of an 'Oz'-like underground magazine called 'Mouth'. His friends are the feminist Jill, laid-back Alex, and the half-wit Hugo. Back in the late '60's, there was a feeling of incredible optimism amongst the young, that they could change the world through the printing of magazines nobody read. Rather than sneering at the hippies' naivety, 'Hippies' is affectionate towards it. Arthur Mathews' scripts cheekily parody a number of that era's icons - 'Hair', 'Woodstock', 'The Graduate', even the infamous 'Oz' obscenity trial of the early '70's. Excellent performances from the cast; Julian Rhind-Tutt's 'Alex' strangely put me in mind of the Richard O'Sullivan character from 'Man About The House'. Its a shame that there was never a second series, possibly because of people like me. If you missed 'Hippies', give it a try. Once you get past the dire opener, you're in for a treat!

Question: Who sends a heist notice ? Movie plot title: Case Closed: The Last Wizard of the Century Movie plot: The Phantom Thief Kid sends a heist notice, warning of another heist. The police deduce that his next target is a recently discovered FabergÃ© egg, which Suzuki Modern Art Museum in Osaka will display on August 22. The night of the heist, Kid steals the egg and flies off, and Conan and Heiji give chase. However, in the middle of the chase, an unknown assailant shoots Kid in the right eye, and Kid apparently falls into the sea to his death. After recovering the egg, the police fruitlessly search for Kid's body. The next day, Conan, Ran, and Kogoro board a boat to Tokyo. They meet Natsumi Kousaka, whose great-grandfather worked in FabergÃ©'s factory. She shows them a part of a sketch of two eggs and a key, which were found among her late grandmother's momentos. Conan suspects that the person who shot Kid is on the ship. That night, Ryu Sagawa, a freelance photographer covering the press with news of the egg, is murdered, shot in the right eye in the same fashion as Kid. Soon after his body is discovered, Inspector Megure with officers Takagi and Shiratori arrives by helicopter to inspect the crime scene. At first, they suspect Serena's father's servant, Mr. Nishino, but the police and Conan conclude the culprit is Scorpion - a mysterious killer who always shoots his victims in the right eye. A missing lifeboat hints that Scorpion has escaped, and the boat's passengers go to Yokosuka Castle, which holds Scorpion's next target: the second egg. While exploring the castle, the group stumbles across secret passages beneath the castle. As they traverse the tunnels, Inui, an art dealer, pursues a shadowy figure he sees in one of the tunnels, and is shot by a silenced handgun. Delving farther into the tunnel, they find a coffin with a corpse clutching the second egg. Suddenly, the two eggs are snatched away. Conan deduces that Scorpion is Seiran the historian. She shoots her victims in the right eye to avenge her ancestor, Rasputin, whose body was found with an eye missing. Seiran attempts to kill Conan with her last... A:","completion":"The Phantom Thief Kid sends the heist notice as indicated in the movie plot summary for \\"Case Closed: The Last Wizard of the Century\\". This notice sets the initial events of the movie in motion as it informs the police and others involved in the storyline that the Phantom Thief Kid is planning to embark upon another heist. We infer from the summary that this is not the first time that the Phantom Thief Kid has issued such a notice, hence it seems to be a part of his modus operandi to inform his targets beforehand. In response to this notice, the police theorize that the Thief's upcoming target is going to be a recently identified Fabergé egg that is set to be exhibited at the Suzuki Modern Art Museum in Osaka. This sets up the anticipation and excitement for the upcoming events and provides an opportunity for the protagonist, Conan, to proactively seek out and try to prevent the Phantom Thief Kid's planned robbery. On the night of the suggested heist, the Phantom Thief Kid accomplishes his mission by successfully stealing the egg and taking off, prompting Conan and Heiji to follow him. However, their pursuit leads to an unexpected twist when an unknown attacker shoots the Phantom Thief Kid in his right eye, causing him to seemingly fall into the sea, presumably dead. Therefore, the heist notice in the context of the movie plot \\"Case Closed: The Last Wizard of the Century\\" stands as a significant element that establishes the plot progression. It not only introduces the modus operandi of the Phantom Thief Kid, but allows the police and Conan to be aware and in anticipation of his next move. This plays into the dynamics of the interactions between the characters, building suspense and setting the pace for the events that are about to unravel. The heist notice ultimately serves as a catalyst driving the varied events of the movie plot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He stated that he was born in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, in 1915, but it is believed to be more likely that he was born in Jug's Corner, in neighboring Issaquena County, in 1913. Recent research has uncovered documentation showing that in the 1930s and 1940s, before his rise to fame, the year of his birth was reported as 1913 on his marriage license, recording notes, and musicians' union card. A 1955 interview in the Chicago Defender is the earliest in which he stated 1915 as the year of his birth, and he continued to say this in interviews from that point onward. Initially, the Chess brothers would not allow Muddy Waters to use his working band in the recording studio; instead, he was provided with a backing bass by Ernest \\"Big\\" Crawford or by musicians assembled specifically for the recording session, including \\"Baby Face\\" Leroy Foster and Johnny Jones. Gradually, Chess relented, and by September 1953 he was recording with one of the most acclaimed blues groups in history: Little Walter Jacobs on harmonica, Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Elga Edmonds (also known as Elgin Evans) on drums, and Otis Spann on piano. The band recorded a series of blues classics during the early 1950s, some with the help of the bassist and songwriter Willie Dixon, including \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", \\"I Just Want to Make Love to You\\", and \\"I'm Ready\\". Along with his former harmonica player Little Walter Jacobs and recent southern transplant Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters reigned over the early 1950s Chicago blues scene, his band becoming a proving ground for some of the city's best blues talent. Little Walter continued a collaborative relationship long after he left Muddy Waters's band in 1952, appearing on most of the band's classic recordings in the 1950s. Muddy Waters developed a long-running, generally good-natured rivalry with Wolf. The success of his ensemble paved the way for others in his group to make their own solo careers. In 1952, Little Walter left when his single \\"Juke\\" became a hit, and in 1955, Rogers quit to work exclusively with his own band, which had been a sideline until that time. During the mid-1950s, Muddy Waters' singles were frequently on Billboard magazine's various Rhythm & Blues charts including \\"Sugar Sweet\\" in 1955 and \\"Trouble No More\\", \\"Forty Days and Forty Nights\\", and \\"Don't Go No Farther\\" in 1956. 1956 also saw the release of one of his best-known numbers, \\"Got My Mojo Working\\", although it did not appear on the charts. However, by the late 1950s, his singles success had come to an end, with only \\"Close to You\\" reaching the chart in 1958. Also in 1958, Chess released Muddy Waters' first album, The Best of Muddy Waters, which collected twelve of his singles up to 1956. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Who was with Muddy Waters in the blues group ?","completion":"In Muddy Waters' blues group, he was accompanied by Little Walter Jacobs on harmonica, Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Elga Edmonds (also known as Elgin Evans) on drums, and Otis Spann on piano.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Spiders are not insects as many people believe. They belong to a class of animals called arachnids . Spiders have eight eyes, four pairs of legs, and can grow a new leg if they lose one. A spider's body is divided into two sections: the abdomen and the thorax .The legs, eyes, and mouthparts are in the thorax section. Most spiders have poison glands and sharp teeth. They use their sharp teeth to force poison into the insects they catch for food. This poison can make an insect lose the ability to move, and the helpless insect is then _ by the spider. Spiders usually have silk glands under their abdomen. They produce a liquid that is thicker than water from their glands. When the liquid comes into the air, it dries into silk. Many spiders use this silk to form webs to catch insects and to make cocoons that protect their eggs. This amazing silk is also used to create lines that spiders hang onto as they travel to new areas. Spiders live in almost everywhere on earth. The only places where there are no spiders are the coldest places, the highest mountains and the seas. Question: According to the passage, which of the following is WRONG?

Given the below context: Neill was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him in charge of the Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks. He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack. Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Seguín left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer. In response to Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29.

Summarize: In the wake of loss, you often forget your bigger goals in life. You may think losing your first love means you've failed on the goal to find a loving relationship in life. However, look at your larger goals in terms of relationships. One failed relationship does not mean you've failed on your goals. Revisit what you want out of life. In addition to finding a loving partner, think of other goals. What kind of career or education do you want, for example? Remember that it's okay to take a break from relationships for a while. You don't have to focus on finding romance again right away. Give yourself time to heal and pursue other goals, then get back into dating when you're ready. One loss does not mean you have failed. In fact, the vast majority of people face a lot of loss and rejection on the path to larger goals. You do not need this one particular person to eventually reach your goals. Many people feel getting involved with someone else will help them forget their first love. While a new relationship can help distract you from thoughts of the current one, you're not likely to find relationship success this way. Instead of jumping into a new romance, take some time to reflect. Think about what you want out of a relationship. Think about the ways your need were and were not met. This will help you figure out how to find a more suitable partner in the future. Many people jump from romance to romance, hoping to find the right person. However, if you're not okay on your own, you will not be able to have a functional romance. You need to grieve your first love and figure out what you want for the future. When you're recovering from a recent breakup, you will probably be very emotionally vulnerable for a while. The feelings that you may develop for other people during this time will not always be rational. Be cautious about pursuing these feelings, since you may be at risk of being hurt or taken advantage of by someone who recognizes your vulnerability. Look for a friend, family member, or c-worker who has also suffered heartbreak, but moved on successfully. Try to model your behavior off of someone who does not need a relationship to feel fulfilled and happy. Find someone who does okay on their own. You want to lean on someone who does not need a relationship to feel fulfilled. Once you've found someone, think about how they cope with heartbreak. Look for the ways they stay independent and strong after a relationship ends. If you feel comfortable doing so, ask the person to be your mentor. Reach out to them for advice from time to time during your recovery process. However, take care not to become too needy or dependent on them. While you may want to move forward, it's important to acknowledge your feelings. Take steps to feel better, but accept sadness is a normal part of the process. Getting over a first love is hard, and even if you're doing everything right it will not happen over night. Do not beat yourself up for having bad days. This is normal and it will take time to move on. Don't panic if a reminder of your ex leaves you feeling bad. If you try to hard to avoid the bad feeling, you may make it worse. Instead, accept that you're going to feel sad for a bit. Let yourself cry if necessary. Get the bad feelings out so you can continue to move forward.

Q:Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture. He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B. Would zone A have less or more oxygen than zone B? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. A:","completion":"Based on the given information, zone A, the dead zone near agricultural lands, would have less oxygen than zone B, the lake near a national park that has not been declared as a dead zone. The primary reason for this difference in oxygen levels can be attributed to the presence of higher amounts of nitrogen in zone A as a result of agricultural practices involving the use of fertilizers. In zone A, the runoff from agricultural fields carries dissolved fertilizers, which are rich in nitrogen, into the nearby lake. This influx of nutrients, particularly nitrogen, accelerates the growth of algae in the water, causing an algal bloom. As the dense population of algae photosynthesize, they consume carbon dioxide from the water, leading to a depletion of carbon dioxide. After the algae die off, decomposer organisms such as bacteria break down the dead algal tissue. During this decomposition process, the decomposers consume dissolved oxygen present in the water. Due to the large amount of dead algae, the decomposers' oxygen demand increases, leading to a rapid depletion of oxygen levels in the water. This creates a hypoxic or oxygen-deficient environment, which is not conducive for the survival of most aquatic organisms. Consequently, the affected area, in this case zone A, becomes a dead zone where there is too little oxygen for most living organisms to survive and thrive. On the other hand, zone B, which is the lake near the national park, is not prone to the same level of agricultural runoff and nitrogen enrichment. This means that the growth of algae in zone B is not accelerated to the same extent as in zone A, thus avoiding the chain of events that lead to the creation of a dead zone. As a result, zone B would have higher oxygen levels compared to zone A, allowing for a healthier aquatic ecosystem and a more conducive environment for various aquatic organisms to flourish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How does a change in AC frequency affect an electrical system? What is the use of frequency in A electrical system?","completion":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning. Although both questions revolve around the topic of frequency in an electrical system, they focus on different aspects and seek different information. Let's analyze and elaborate on both questions to give a clearer understanding of their meanings. 1. How does a change in AC frequency affect an electrical system? This question is concerned with the effects of varying frequency on an electrical system, particularly an alternating current (AC) system. It aims to explore the consequences of frequency changes on the performance and characteristics of an AC electrical system. As for the answer to this question, a change in AC frequency can affect an electrical system in various ways: a. Impact on electrical motors: AC motors, specifically induction motors, operate at a speed proportional to the frequency of the supplied voltage. Consequently, any change in the frequency will affect the motor's rotation speed, which might lead to inefficient operation or even damage the motor. b. Power output: The frequency of AC systems is directly related to the power output for synchronous and induction generators. Variations in frequency can cause fluctuations in the power output that may result in undesirable system instabilities. c. Load balancing: Power stations are often designed to work at specific frequencies. Therefore, any deviation from the standard frequency could affect load balancing; simultaneously, generation, transmission, and consumption of the electrical power might not be optimally matched. d. Resonance: The inductive and capacitive loads in the electrical system exhibit frequency-dependent behavior. Changes in frequency might cause resonance, resulting in large currents or voltages in the system, imposing a risk of equipment damage. e. Transformers: The operation of a transformer relies on the magnetic induction principle, which is affected by the rate of voltage change or frequency. A variation in frequency may cause excessive heating, decreased efficiency, and even failure of transformers. 2. What is the use of frequency in an electrical system? This question is focused on understanding the role or purpose of frequency in an electrical system. It seeks to explain the significance of frequency in maintaining and operating an electrical system. Frequency plays a crucial role in various aspects of an electrical system, as detailed below: a. AC generation: In generators, frequency is determined by the speed at which the rotor rotates within a magnetic field. For synchronous generators, the rotation speed is directly related to the frequency produced, resulting in an efficient generation of electrical energy that can be transferred across power systems. b. Power quality and stability: Maintaining a stable frequency is essential for ensuring a consistent power supply and quality. In electrical grids, the frequency must be strictly regulated to avoid instabilities and potential damages to infrastructure and end-user equipment. c. Timekeeping: The consistency and accuracy of AC frequency allow for timekeeping applications, such as using the 50 Hz or 60 Hz frequency as a reference for electric clocks or measuring devices. d. Signal transmission: In communication systems, frequency plays a vital role in signal transmission and separation, which enables multiple signals to be transmitted concurrently without interference. e. AC motor control: As mentioned earlier, the operation of AC motors is influenced by the supplied frequency. Frequency control is widely used in motor speed control for applications like adjustable-speed drives in HVAC systems, escalators, and conveyor belts. In conclusion, it is evident that the two questions are different. The first question aims to understand the impact of frequency changes on an electrical system, while the second question focuses on the importance and uses of frequency within electrical systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: Steamtown, U.S.A., was a steam locomotive museum that ran steam excursions out of North Walpole, New Hampshire, and Bellows Falls, Vermont, from the 1960s to 1983. The museum was founded by millionaire seafood industrialist F. Nelson Blount. The non-profit Steamtown Foundation took over operations following his death in 1967. Because of Vermont's air quality regulations restricting steam excursions, declining visitor attendance, and disputes over the use of track, some pieces of the collection were relocated to Scranton, Pennsylvania, in the mid-1980s and the rest were auctioned off. After the move, Steamtown continued to operate in Scranton but failed to attract the expected 200,000–400,000 visitors. Within two years the tourist attraction was facing bankruptcy, and more pieces of the collection were sold to pay off debt. In 1986, the United States House of Representatives, under the urging of Pennsylvania Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. As a result, the National Park Service (NPS) conducted historical research on the equipment that remained in the Foundation's possession. This research was used as a Scope of Collections Statement for the Steamtown National Historic Site. The scope was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. The report provided concise histories of each piece of equipment and made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the soon-to-be government-funded collection. By 1995, Steamtown had been acquired and developed by the NPS with a 66 million allocation. Several more pieces have been removed from the collection as a result of the government acquisition.

When all the colonies voted in favour of federation, the Federation of Australia commenced, resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The model of Australian federalism adheres closely to the original model of the United States of America, although it does so through a parliamentary Westminster system rather than a presidential system. Solution:","completion":"Question: What was the initial response of the French colonies in Australia to the proposal of forming a unified \\"Commonwealth\\" within the British Empire during the 1880s? Justification: This question is unanswerable because the passage primarily focuses on the British colonization and establishment of Australia. It mentions the six self-governing colonies established by the United Kingdom and their referendums in the 1890s, but it does not provide any information about French colonies or any involvement in the formation of the Commonwealth of Australia. Additionally, the question has replaced the 1890s with the 1880s, which is not mentioned in the passage as part of the referendums process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Martinez had been stranded about 3,700 metres up Canada's highest peak since Monday, after a pair of earthquakes hit the area, making the terrain too dangerous for her to leave her camp. After a lucky break in the weather on Thursday, the rescue team sprang into action, knowing they likely had a small window to work in.

Natalia Martínez, who began a solo traverse of 5,959-metre Mount Logan in the Yukon late last month, was at an elevation of about 3,900 metres when a 6.2-magnitude earthquake hit Yukon and Alaska on Monday, sending snow and glacial ice crashing down around her camp. A few hours later, the mountain was rattled by a second earthquake of magnitude 6.3 along with several aftershocks. Martínez – ensconced in her tent about 135 miles from the earthquakes’ epicentre – was unscathed by the avalanches triggered by the quakes, but left stranded. A message posted on the ExpeNews website popular with climbers said Martínez was rescued on Thursday night. ExpeNews said a pilot with the charter service Icefield Discovery had noticed an improvement in weather conditions and alerted a rescue team. The website said Martínez was taken to the Icefield Discovery base in Kluane Lake. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Martínez on the summit of Mount Malaspina on the Saint Elias Mountains of Yukon. Photograph: Courtesy of Camilo A Rada Giacaman Camilo Rada, Martínez’s climbing partner of 10 years, said this week that Martínez had been working hard to keep her camp safe and to stay safe. He described Martínez as a highly accomplished climber whose experiences in Patagonia had readied her for heavy winds and extreme cold. “She’s used to really serious weather in Patagonia, she had been through a number of storms and she knows what to do. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy – it’s very tiring, especially if you have to do it alone,” he said. Rada, who was in regular contact with Martínez via satellite phone from his home in British Columbia, said the 37-year-old was in her tent on Monday morning when she heard what she described as a tremendous roar. “She didn’t know it was an earthquake. She thought the glacier she was on was collapsing,” said Rada. “The whole ground around her was shaking and moved a lot. She was pretty scared.” Associated Press contributed to this report ||||| ADVERTISEMENT WHITEHORSE — A climber who was stranded on Canada's highest mountain following an earthquake in Yukon has reportedly been rescued. Natalia Martinez, 37, of Argentina, began a solo climb on Mount Logan in Kluane National Park and Reserve on April 22. Two large earthquakes on Monday caused avalanches near her camp. A message posted by ExpeNews on its website — which is used by climbers, trekkers and outdoor enthusiasts to track their progress and location — said Martinez was successfully rescued in a three-hour operation that ended at about 10:30 p.m. local time.

The website said Martinez was taken to the Icefield Discovery base in Kluane Lake in southwest Yukon. Solo attempts to climb the mountain are rare Parks Canada spokeswoman Christine Aikens said earlier that officials were in close contact with Martinez — an experienced climber who reported that she still had a good supply of food and fuel. Aikens said avalanches caused by the quakes had caused glacial ice to fall in the area of the climber's camp, which is at 3,900-metre level on the east ridge of Mount Logan. An average of 25 climbers try to summit the mountain every year, but Aikens said solo attempts are rare. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Argentinian climber Natalia Martinez was rescued from Canada's highest peak, Mount Logan in Yukon territory, after being stranded at 3,700 meters for several days following a pair of earthquakes.

The software maker claims that Google used its dominant position in the search market to restrict the growth of Microsoft services. It cites a number of practices, including Google limiting the ability of Microsoft Bing to index web content. Google said it was not surprised by the move and it would happily discuss its business with the European Commission. In a detailed blog, Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith, outlined the company's grievances. He wrote: \\"Our filing today focuses on a pattern of actions that Google has taken to entrench its dominance in the markets for online search and search advertising to the detriment of European consumers.\\" The post goes on to list five different ways in which Google, according to Microsoft, has sought to control the search market. Those are: The European Commission launched an investigation into allegations of anti-competitive practices by Google last November, at the behest of several internet companies, including Ciao, a shopping site owned by Microsoft. It is likely, if the Commission accepts the latest round of complaints from Microsoft, that they would be rolled into the same investigation. For the Microsoft case to be accepted, the company would have to prove two things - firstly that Google was dominant in a particular market, namely search, and secondly that it had abused that position. In a statement, Google said it would cooperate with any investigation. \\"We're not surprised that Microsoft has done this, since one of their subsidiaries was one of the original complainants. For our part, we continue to discuss the case with the European Commission and we're happy to explain to anyone how our business works,\\" is stated. Penalties for companies found to have engaged in anti-competitive practices in Europe can be severe. The EC has the power to impose fines up to 10% of global earnings. That will likely have a bearing on how the case proceeds, according to Mark Tricker, an antitrust lawyer with the law firm Norton Rose. He told BBC News: \\"Once the Commission has formulated its claims then I suspect that Google will enter into a dialogue with them to address those concerns so it does not have to reach a judgement.\\" Microsoft's position as accuser in an anti-competition case is something of a role reversal. In the past, the world's leading software company has been the target of similar actions. A 2003 EC ruling determined that Microsoft had unfairly advantaged its Windows Media Player software over other streaming technologies by embedding it into the Windows operating system. It was fined Â£381m, followed by a further Â£194m in 2006 for failing to comply with elements of the original ruling. To date, the largest fine levied by the EC was Â£948m against Intel in 2009.

Lynyrd Skynyrd ( LEN-@rd-SKIN-@rd) is an American rock band best known for having popularized the Southern rock genre during the 1970s. Originally formed in 1964 as My Backyard in Jacksonville, Florida, the band was also known by names such as The Noble Five and One Percent, before finally deciding on \\"Lynyrd Skynyrd\\" in 1969. The band gained worldwide recognition for its live performances and signature songs \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" and \\"Free Bird\\". At the peak of their success, band members Ronnie Van Zant and Steve Gaines, and backup singer Cassie Gaines, died in an airplane crash in 1977, putting an abrupt end to the 1970s era of the band. In the summer of 1964, teenage friends Ronnie Van Zant, Bob Burns, Allen Collins, Gary Rossington, and Larry Junstrom formed the earliest incarnation of the band in Jacksonville, Florida as My Backyard. The band then changed its name to The Noble Five. The band used different names before using One Percent during 1968. In 1969, Van Zant sought a new name. The group settled on Leonard Skinnerd, a mocking tribute to physical education teacher Leonard Skinner at Robert E. Lee High School. Skinner was notorious for strictly enforcing the school's policy against boys having long hair. Rossington dropped out of school, tired of being hassled about his hair. The more distinctive spelling \\"Lynyrd Skynyrd\\" was being used at least as early as 1970. Despite their high school acrimony, the band developed a friendlier relationship with Skinner in later years, and invited him to introduce them at a concert in the Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum. Skinner also allowed the band to use a photo of his Leonard Skinner Realty sign for the inside of their third album. By 1970, Lynyrd Skynyrd had become a top band in Jacksonville, headlining at some local concerts, and opening for several national acts. Pat Armstrong, a Jacksonville native and partner in Macon, Georgia-based Hustlers Inc. with Phil Walden's younger brother, Alan Walden, became the band's managers. Armstrong left Hustlers shortly thereafter to start his own agency. Walden stayed with the band until 1974, when management was turned over to Peter Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving blues rock sound and image, and experimenting with recording their sound in a studio. Skynyrd crafted this distinctively \\"southern\\" sound through a creative blend of blues, and a slight British rock influence. During this time, the band experienced some lineup changes for the first time. Junstrom left and was briefly replaced by Greg T. Walker on bass. At that time, Ricky Medlocke joined as a second drummer and occasional second vocalist to help fortify Burns' sound on the drums. Medlocke grew up with the founding members of Lynyrd Skynyrd and his grandfather Shorty Medlocke was an influence in the writing of \\"The Ballad of Curtis Loew\\". Some versions of the band's history state Burns briefly left the band during this time, although other versions state that Burns played with the band continuously through 1974. The band played some shows with both Burns and Medlocke, using a dual-drummer approach. In 1971, they made some recordings at the famous Muscle Shoals Sound Studio with Walker and Medlocke serving as the rhythm section, but without the participation of Burns. Medlocke and Walker left the band to play with another southern rock band, Blackfoot. When the Lynyrd Skynyrd made a second round of Muscle Shoals recordings in 1972, Burns was once again featured on drums along with new bassist, Leon Wilkeson. Medlocke and Walker did not appear on any album until the 1978 release of First and... Last, which compiled the early Muscle Shoals sessions. Also in 1972, roadie Billy Powell became the keyboardist for the band. Entity:","completion":"Lynyrd Skynyrd"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The U.S. Department of Justice filed an unprecedented lawsuit Thursday against the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office for refusing to provide full access to records and facilities for a civil-rights investigation. The federal lawsuit Arpaio, Pearce respond The suit alleges the Sheriff's Office is in violation of federal civil-rights laws by refusing for 17 months to fully cooperate with an investigation into police practices and jail operations. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Phoenix, names Sheriff Joe Arpaio, his office and Maricopa County. The Justice Department wants extensive records related to booking procedures, language and interpretation services, arrests, and access to staff and jails. County officials said Arpaio is jeopardizing future federal funding, which requires government agencies to comply with civil-rights laws. Six percent of the county's 2 billion budget comes from federal funding, and a loss would be \\"catastrophic,\\" county officials said. The federal investigation dates to 2008 and seeks to determine whether the Sheriff's Office discriminates on the basis of national origin. Arpaio denies any discrimination and said he was surprised by the lawsuit. He has 21 days to respond. The civil-rights probe is unrelated to a separate abuse-of-power criminal investigation against the Sheriff's Office by the Justice Department, which is connected to long-running disputes with county government and the judiciary and has led to months of grand-jury testimony. Attorneys for the Sheriff's Office repeatedly have said they were cooperating with the civil-rights probe but set conditions on the breadth of documents they would release and when. Last week, a sheriff's attorney said in a letter to the Justice Department that he had not agreed to their deadlines. On Thursday, federal officials made good on their threat to sue. Justice Department officials could not point to a case within the past 30 years in which they had to sue a law-enforcement department to provide access to information. Dennis Burke, U.S. attorney for Arizona, said that Arpaio's behavior is \\"self-serving\\" and pointed out that the Sheriff's Office is legally obligated to provide access to records and facilities because the office receives federal money. \\"This is about accountability, and the Sheriff Office's lack of it,\\" Burke told The Republic. \\"They're trying to design their own self-serving, contorted rules, and they expect unprecedented special treatment different than any other law-enforcement agency across the country - or in history. They want to voluntarily comply with what they want to comply with - despite repeated requests over 17 months.\\" Attorney Robert Driscoll, who has been negotiating with the Justice Department on Arpaio's behalf, denounced the lawsuit as an attempt to undermine Arpaio's immigration enforcement. Arpaio released a statement saying President Barack Obama's administration \\"intended to sue us all along, no matter what we did to try to avert it.\\" But, according to the lawsuit, officials in the Justice Department's civil-rights unit first started looking at allegations of civil-rights violations by the Sheriff's Office in June 2008, during the George W. Bush era. The probe was not revealed publicly until March 2009. Arpaio, however, contends the inquiry is part of a conspiracy connecting the White House, Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon and local advocacy groups. The discussions The complaint details the back-and-forth discussions between the Sheriff's Office and the Justice Department, culminating in Driscoll's letter last week. In that letter, he agreed to cooperate but not to the extent requested by the investigators. Driscoll had met with Justice Department officials just days earlier. In a memo of that meeting, a chief in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division detailed the records that must be produced and asked to tour six jails and interview staff about a range of issues, including intake and booking procedures, and language and interpretation services. Investigators also requested documents related to arrests dating to January 2008. The attorney asked the Justice Department to be more specific about what it wanted and indicated he would not make a Sept. 10 deadline. Burke said Driscoll's response triggered the lawsuit. \\"The letter contradicts what they said in the meeting,\\" he said. According to legal experts, the lawsuit seeking records will be difficult for Arpaio to win. Paul Bender, an Arizona State University law professor and former deputy solicitor for the Justice Department, said such disputes \\"are usually resolved in favor of the person looking for the documents. You're entitled to get anything that might be relevant.\\" But Bender said civil-rights offenses are difficult to prove. \\"You have to show intent,\\" he said, and that is why investigators want to look at a wide range of documents and policies. \\"This investigation goes to the heart of people's complaints against Sheriff Joe, that he discriminates in his traffic stops and jail practices.\\" Jose de Jesus Rivera, a former U.S. attorney for Arizona, agreed. \\"It's pretty clear cut that they're entitled to those records,\\" he said. \\"It's not like they're rushing to judgment. They've given them a year and a half to comply.\\" Paul Charlton, another former U.S. Attorney for Arizona, agreed: \\"When people are fighting you for documents you have a right to, there's reason to believe those documents show evidence of consciousness of guilt. There's no other reason not to turn them over.\\" Reaction was swift from some Hispanic leaders, including County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox, who called on Arpaio to cooperate fully with the Justice Department. \\"This is ridiculous and irresponsible, so give over your documents, give them access to your facilities, and give interviews with your staff and comply,\\" Wilcox said. An attorney for the county Board of Supervisors proposed Thursday afternoon in a letter to the Justice Department that the Sheriff's Office and the federal government resolve the matter through mediation. The attorney, Tom Irvine, asked the Justice Department to enter mediation next week, before the dispute goes to court. Arpaio's refusal Arpaio first refused to cooperate with federal officials back in July 2009, three months after the probe became public. His reasoning alternated from an allegation that the Justice Department was not clearly articulating the scope of the investigation, to Arpaio's belief that federal investigators violated their own policy when they tried to gain access to documents that sheriff's officials already had turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as part of an annual audit. Arpaio and Driscoll also claim Justice officials already have access to thousands of documents they obtained over the course of two other ongoing civil lawsuits involving racial profiling. But Burke and other legal experts point out that Arpaio does not get to direct the investigation and decide which documents are relevant. The two sides stopped communicating for months, although Justice representatives promised the inquiry would go on and investigators continued to visit the Valley to speak with potential victims and witnesses. Arpaio began to change his stance on cooperating last month, after the Justice Department first threatened to sue to force the Sheriff's Office to turn over the records. The next day, Arpaio's attorney said the Sheriff's Office was cooperating with certain aspects of the investigation focusing on jails. But Driscoll continued to insist they had no obligation to cooperate with the federal investigation into the sheriff's street-level enforcement practices. Arpaio said he was caught off-guard by Thursday's filing: \\"They have hundreds and thousands of reports,\\" he said. \\"Why did this happen now?\\" The Sheriff's Office has agreed to turn over 500,000 e-mails and 100,000 documents related to immigration enforcement, a spokeswoman said. Funding is at stake The consequences for failing to cooperate with the probe could be financially harmful, officials and attorneys said. At stake is 113 million in future federal funding for the county, they say, which is given on the condition that officials agree they will not discriminate against residents and will cooperate with federal officials. The money funds dozens of programs, such as nutrition for women and children, energy assistance for low-income families, housing, and health care for the homeless. Supervisors attorney Irvine said it is unclear if federal officials could rescind money they have already awarded to the county. But future funding could be at risk because county officials regularly have to certify they are complying with federal laws. Because the Board of Supervisors is uncertain if those laws are being followed, they cannot sign for certification that allows them to apply for the funds. \\"Worst case is that if the federal opinion is that Maricopa County is out of compliance with Title VI (of the Civil Rights Act of 1964), and if that were to last a year, that would eliminate all 113 million,\\" Irvine said. \\"We have no certainty that environmental, highway, health, federal monies will not be severely impacted. Hopefully, that doesn't happen.\\" County officials also hope Arpaio will agree to work with the Justice Department to avoid legal fees. The county already has paid out more than 3.2 million in taxpayer dollars to pay for attorneys, audits and expenses related to the ongoing disputes that have embroiled county government. Several of those battles were waged over access to sheriff's records. For example, sheriff's officials are fighting with the supervisors over access to financial and personnel records, which has cost upward of 100,000 in public funds. ||||| The U.S. Justice Department sued Sheriff Joe Arpaio on Thursday, saying the Arizona lawman refused for more than a year to turn over records in an investigation into allegations his department discriminates against Hispanics. The lawsuit calls Arpaio and his office's defiance \\"unprecedented,\\" and said the federal government has been trying since March 2009 to get officials to comply with its probe of alleged discrimination, unconstitutional searches and seizures, and having English-only policies in his jails that discriminates against people with limited English skills. Arpaio had been given until Aug. 17 to hand over documents it first asked for 15 months ago. Arpaio's attorney, Robert Driscoll, declined immediate comment on the lawsuit, saying he had just received it and hadn't yet conferred with his client. Arpaio's office had said it has fully cooperated in the jail inquiry but won't hand over additional documents into the examination of the alleged unconstitutional searches because federal authorities haven't said exactly what they were investigating. It's the latest action against Arizona by the federal government, which earlier sued the state to stop its strict new immigration law that requires police officers to question people about their immigration status. \\"The actions of the sheriff's office are unprecedented,\\" said Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general for the department's civil rights division. \\"It is unfortunate that the department was forced to resort to litigation to gain access to public documents and facilities.\\" The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Phoenix and names Arpaio, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office and the county. Arizona's new law _ most of which a federal judge has put on hold _ mirrors many of the policies Arpaio has put into place in the greater Phoenix area, where he set up a hot line for the public to report immigration violations, conducts crime and immigration sweeps in heavily Latino neighborhoods and frequently raids workplaces for people in the U.S. illegally. Arpaio believes the inquiry is focused on his immigration sweeps, patrols where deputies flood an area of a city _ in some cases heavily Latino areas _ to seek out traffic violators and arrest other offenders. Critics say his deputies pull people over for minor traffic infractions because of the color of their skin so they can ask them for their proof of citizenship. Arpaio denies allegations of racial profiling, saying people are stopped if deputies have probable cause to believe they've committed crimes and that it's only afterward that deputies find many of them are illegal immigrants. The sheriff's office has said half of the 1,032 people arrested in the sweeps have been illegal immigrants. Last year, the federal government stripped Arpaio of his special power to enforce federal immigration law. The sheriff continued his sweeps through the enforcement of state immigration laws. Last year, the nearly 113 million that the county received from the federal government accounted for about 5 percent of the county's 2 billion budget. Arpaio's office said it receives 3 million to 4 million each year in federal funds. In a separate investigation, a federal grand jury in Phoenix is examining allegations that Arpaio has abused his powers with actions such as intimidating county workers by showing up at their homes at nights and on weekends. ___ Associated Press writer Paul Davenport contributed to this report. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office because they refused to provide full access to records and facilities for a civil-rights investigation.

Context: The night when she thought she would finally be a star, Maria Isabella du'l Cielo struggled to calm the trembling of her hands, reached over to cut the tether that tied her to the ground, and thought of that morning many years before when she'd first caught a glimpse of Lorenzo du Vicenzio ei Salvadore: tall, thick-browed and handsome, his eyes closed, oblivious to the cacophony of the accident waiting to occur around him. Maria Isabella had just turned sixteen then, and each set of her padrinos had given her (along with the sequined brida du caballo, the dresses of rare tulle, organza, and seda, and the diadema floral du'l dama -- the requisite floral circlet of young womanhood) a purse filled with coins to spend on anything she wanted. And so she'd gone past the Calle du Leones (where sleek cats of various pedigrees sometimes allowed themselves to be purchased, though if so, only until they tired of their new owners), walked through the Avenida du'l Conquistadores (where the statues of the conquerors of Ciudad Meiora lined the entirety of the broad promenade) and made her way to the Encantu lu Caminata (that maze-like series of interconnected streets, each leading to some wonder or marvel for sale), where little musical conch shells from the islets near Palao'an could be found. Those she liked very much. In the vicinity of the Plaza Emperyal, she saw a young man dressed in a coat embroidered with stars walk almost surely to his death. In that instant, Maria Isabella knew two things with the conviction reserved only for the very young: first, that she almost certainly loved this reckless man; and second, that if she simply stepped on a dog's tail -- the very dog watching the same scene unfold right next to her -- she could avert the man's seemingly senseless death.

News article: The Mo Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership is the world's most generous prizes. It is also proving to be one of its most elusive, after the prize committee announced on Monday that there was no African leader who met the criteria for the 2013 award. This is the second year in a row that no suitable candidate has been found. Since its inception in 2007, the prize has only been awarded three times. Dr Mo Ibrahim, a Sudanese-British telecoms tycoon and philanthropist, established the London-based Mo Ibrahim Foundation to help inspire good governance and exceptional leaders. By finding so few candidates that meet its standards, critics of the award argue it reinforces negative stereotypes about African leaders. Al Jazeera's Yasmine Ryan spoke with Dr Ibrahim about why the foundation is finding it so hard to find awardees, the relationship between rising inequality and worsening rule of law, and the controversy surrounding the International Criminal Court's (ICC) focus on African leaders. Al Jazeera: Were there any leaders who might have qualified who were under consideration for the Mo Ibrahim Prize this year? Mo Ibrahim: Yes of course, I'm not a member of the prize committee, but according to the rules, the committee looks at the people that left office in the last three years, peacefully. It is up to the prize committee to decide whether people meet the standard. We set a very high standard, of course. And we are proud of our prize committee for being credible and tough. It's a prize for excellence, it's not a pension. The Mo Ibrahim Prize A 5-million award followed by 200,000 a year for life Winners include Botswana's Festus Mogae, Mozambique's Joaquim Chissano.and Cape Verde's Pedro Verona Pires Eligible leaders must have been democratically elected and have left office peacefully within the last three years In 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2013 no award was given AJ: Do you think it's time to expand the prize, perhaps to include the many non-heads of state who are playing a positive transformative role? MI: We created a brand, a prize, for a specific reason. We should not tinker with that. If there is a need to offer prizes to wonderful parliamentarians, to great newsmen or women, to footballers, or whoever, that's fine. But we should not just mix up things together and destroy the brand we have just because one or two years we don't have a winner. What is the objective of this? It's focusing on presidents as tools to change their countries, given the power they have. We have not cornered the market on prizes and we invite everybody else to offer prizes for civil society, for the best NGO, for whatever. Ourselves, we offered a different kind of prize for the Archbishop Desmond Tutu. This was a prize for a brave man who spoke truth to power. AJ: The Nobel Peace Prize committee is, interestingly, often criticised for the opposite reason; for not being selective enough. Do you think the Nobel Peace Prize committee could learn something from the Mo Ibrahim Foundation? MI: I will not start by criticising the Nobel Peace Prize committee, because on my committee we have three Nobel Prize winners, and I'm afraid to upset them! [Laughs] So I pass, no comment. AJ: The Ibrahim Index of African Governance ranking countries according to their performance was also released today. You have said that the information collated in the index is an important empowering tool for citizens in the countries surveyed. In what ways can citizens use this information? From the 2013 Ibrahim Index of African Governance MI: This is a scorecard. It shows exactly what has been achieved over the last 13 years. We've been publishing very detailed data over 13 years. We have 133 parameters we measure. It gives people full details: How effective is the police force? How effective is the judiciary? Women's social and economic rights… This is a wealth of information, for people to see what is strong, to keep doing it, and what needs to be fixed. It also gives an opportunity to compare your performance with that of your neighbour, to enable conversations, peer review. We can pick up the phone and say \\"What are you doing here\\"? Every time I meet an African president, they open up the index. They love it, because it can help them improve their performance. AJ: The index shows that the gap between the best and worst countries is widening. Do you think this growing inequality is a uniquely African issue, or you think it is part of a global trend? MI: There are two areas of inequality. One issue is that we see that eight countries have been in the top ten since the beginning of our data collection. It seems the guys who got it right, they build their institutions and it keeps them on the right path. At the bottom, actually there have been a lot of changes. The best improvement, actually, has been from some of the countries at the bottom, that managed to get out of poverty and did not fall back into the vicious cycle of poverty. The second part [of the issue of inequality] is that the fruits of the economic progress, somehow appear to be limited to the top one percent of the population. That is producing a widening gap between the wealthy and the poor. That produces tension. This phenomenon is not just an African phenomenon, it's happening in the US, it's happening in the UK, it's happening everywhere. This is dangerous. You are building tension inside society. You will reach a point where social cohesion is destroyed. AJ: The index also showed a trend of worsening levels of personal safety and the rule of law. What are the factors driving these trends? MI: I just told you. AJ: That it's due to the inequality? MI: Exactly. Most of the violence before was happening because of tensions and hostilities across borders. Now it is happening because of conflict within the country. We need to look [at] why are we are lacking social cohesion. From the 2013 Ibrahim Index of African Governance AJ: You've spoken in the past about how Africa's youthful population gives it the possibility of becoming the next \\"factory of the world\\". Which countries do you think are best place to do this? MI: I wouldn't like to pick one country. I think the country that's going to do this is the country that's going to produce a better education for its young people, better training for young people. We need people who are able to serve the new economy. We need people who are versed in the new software, people who are good with their hands, smart kids. AJ: Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has called the International Criminal Court \\"imperialist and racist\\", and there are many African leaders who agree with him. Do you think there is any truth to their assertion that the ICC has targeted African leaders unfairly? If so, what's the alternative? MI: I think there's a need for a serious conversation between the African Union and the ICC. On one hand, the allegation that the ICC has only tried or prosecuted African leaders is correct. Do atrocities only happen in Africa? What is happening in Myanmar, what is happening in Baghdad? Where is the ICC? That's a valid question. On the other hand, Africa has no alternative to the ICC. We don’t have an African criminal court that is capable of really trying crimes against humanity. So when we have victims in Africa – and we do have victims in many cases – who can give them justice? Instead of throwing out the baby with the bathwater, we need to find a way to reconcile the two. We need to find a way to the ICC so that it doesn't become just a political tool, as it is perceived by some African leaders. Global governance is in crisis. Do we say \\"let us withdraw from the United Nations\\"? We love the United Nations, we need the United Nations, what we need to do it to try and reform it, because we need it. That is the same approach we need to take with the ICC and some of these other global governing bodies. Let’s be cool-headed, and find a way to move forward.

The foundation decided against awarding its 2013 5-million prize for a former African head of state or government demonstrating exceptional leadership. (Carl Court / AFP/Getty Images / ) Most Africans are now better governed than in 2000, but the pace of improvement has slowed, and many countries are experiencing setbacks in public safety and the rule of law, a group dedicated to improving leadership on the continent reported Monday. The London-based Mo Ibrahim Foundation released its 2013 Index of Good Governance, finding advances in security and justice in only 20 of the continent's 52 countries. Also lacking, in the judgment of the foundation's prize committee, was any leadership role model for young Africans. For the second year in a row, the foundation decided against awarding its prestigious and lucrative 5-million prize, saying no former African head of state or government deserved it. To be worthy of the prize -- which pays out the 5 million over 10 years, then provides an annual 200,000 stipend for life -- a recipient must have been democratically elected, have left office within the previous three years after fulfilling his or her elected term and have demonstrated excellence in office and progress in fostering sustainable and equitable prosperity. The prize was established in 2007 by Sudanese-born telecoms magnate Mo Ibrahim but has found no worthy recipient in four of those seven years. Previous winners were Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique in 2007, Festus Mogae of Botswana in 2008 and Pedro Pires of Cape Verde in 2011. The index, also first issued in 2007, provides a framework for citizens, governments, institutions and businesses to assess the delivery of public goods and services and policy outcomes across Africa, the foundation says on its website. At the top of the foundation's rankings for governance last year were Mauritius, Botswana, Cape Verde, Seychelles and South Africa. Somalia ranked last, with Congo, Eritrea, Central African Republic and Chad rounding out the bottom of the index. Good governance scores are determined by assessing each African state’s progress since 2000. Although 94% of the continent’s citizens live in countries better governed now than a dozen years ago, the gap between the best- and worst-managed countries has widened and given rise to fears for future African unity, said Salim Ahmed Salim, chairman of the Ibrahim Prize Committee. Some notable highlights of the latest index were the performance of five countries recovering from armed conflicts: Liberia, Angola, Sierra Leone, Rwanda and Burundi have shown the most improvement since 2000, with Angola and Rwanda posting consistent year-on-year advances, the foundation reported.

The prize, worth 5-million followed by a 200,000 annual stipend for life, is awarded to African leaders who demonstrate excellence in office and have made significant progress in fostering sustainable and equitable prosperity.

Question: Process: - Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes - Air enters bronchioles - Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli - Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels - Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels - Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body - Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose it is not rainy season happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case refers to the assumption that the rainy season does not occur, which could potentially lead to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered in the bloodstream. To evaluate whether such a perturbation might have an effect on the respiratory process mentioned, let's analyze each step of the process and consider the external factors that might be influenced by the absence of the rainy season. 1. Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes: At this stage, the quality and composition of the air we breathe could potentially be influenced by the weather and climatic conditions. During the rainy season, there is generally more humidity and the air may contain more airborne particles. This might somewhat affect the efficiency of oxygen intake but is not likely to have a significant impact on the overall process. 2. Air enters bronchioles: Here too, the lack of rainy season might not have a direct impact on the process. However, increased humidity during the rainy season can lead to the development of respiratory infections, which could potentially obstruct the bronchioles and affect oxygen distribution. 3. Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli: The alveoli are responsible for the actual gas exchange, where oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is released. The condition of the alveoli is crucial for efficient oxygen uptake. The absence of a rainy season might not have a direct effect on the alveoli, but external factors such as air pollution or dry air could indirectly affect the respiratory process. 4. Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels & oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels: The efficiency of oxygen uptake is determined by the surface area of the alveoli and the effectiveness of small blood vessels. In a dry environment, due to the absence of rainy season, air might become more polluted with particulate matter, which could potentially damage alveoli and blood vessels over time, leading to reduced oxygen absorption. 5. Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body, blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs, and carbon dioxide released when you exhale: These steps are essential to maintaining a proper balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. The absence of rainy season might not have a direct impact on these steps, but the effects of external factors such as increased air pollution, increased risk of respiratory infections, and dry air could indirectly affect the overall efficiency of the respiratory process. In conclusion, while it might not have a direct impact on the respiratory process, the absence of rainy season could indirectly affect oxygen delivery to the bloodstream through various external factors such as air quality, humidity, and the likelihood of developing respiratory infections. These factors could potentially lead to a reduced efficiency in the process of oxygen uptake and delivery to the cells, ultimately affecting the body's proper functioning and overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Not long ago, people could only buy organic food in small shops. Today it is common in most major supermarkets. The reason for the increase is that more and more people are demanding food grown without chemicals. Since the 1990s, organic farm production has gone up 20 percent every year. This pattern is expected to continue around the globe. Australia leads the world in land used for organic agriculture. It has four times as much land devoted to organic farming as all of Asia. However, most of the land is not very fertile, and it only produces a modest amount of food. Argentina is a distant second, followed by Brazil, the United States and China. In Africa, only a very small amount of land is registered for organic farming. That does not mean Africa relies on chemicals. In fact, many farmers do not use chemicals because they cannot afford them. Yet there are no programs for these farmers to prove they do not use chemicals. Without these programs their food can never be approved organic. India has had the most dramatic recent increase in organic farming. Like many other countries, India sees continual growth in organic food sales around the world. This, of course, leads to growth in profits. Sales of organic food were more than doubled from 2000 to 2005. Like India, many countries are trying to increase commercial organic farming to get a share of the sales. This has led to criticism. Some people believe that organic farming should not just be about making money. They think the goal is to help the environment. Others say organic farming will not continue if it is not profitable. They say that people should be able to make money while providing food that is healthy to mankind. Why do people want to increase organic farming? A) More and more people demand chemicals to grow food. B) Profits from organic farming help make approval programs. C) There are fewer chemicals available to the human beings. D) Organic food is good for the Earth and the human beings. Answer:","completion":"D) Organic food is good for the Earth and the human beings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have the equation -301 * v + 317 * v = 160. First, let's see what we have: we have -301 times v (v is a number we're trying to find) plus 317 times v, and that equals 160. Now, let's combine the two parts with v together. So we get (-301 + 317) * v = 160. If we do the math inside the parentheses first (-301 + 317), we get 16. Our new equation now looks like this: 16 * v = 160. Now, we want to find out what v is, so we'll divide both sides of the equation by 16. This will help us find v. So, let's do this: (16 * v) / 16 = 160 / 16. Since 16 divided by 16 equals 1, we're left with: v = 10. There you go, buddy! The answer is v = 10."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To find a good drainage location, find the spot in your garden that dries out the quickest after a pour of rain. If there is no obvious location, plant your lilies on a slope, and let gravity take care of your drainage. Caring for lilies involves more than just selecting the right location. To ensure the healthy growth and flowering of your lilies, you must also follow other appropriate care and planting practices. Here are some detailed steps to help you take care of your lilies: 1. Soil preparation: Lilies prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6 and 6.5. Amend the soil with organic matter, such as peat moss or compost, to improve its acidity, structure, and nutrient content. This will encourage healthy root development and ensure proper drainage. 2. Planting: Plant lily bulbs in the early spring or fall, depending on the variety. Dig a hole that is 5-6 inches deep, placing the bulb with the pointed end facing up. Space the bulbs 8-12 inches apart to allow for growth and airflow. 3. Watering: Lilies need consistent moisture to thrive, but overly wet soil may cause bulb rot. Water your lilies deeply and regularly (about once or twice a week), ensuring the soil is continuously moist but not waterlogged. 4. Fertilizing: Apply a slow-release, balanced fertilizer, such as a 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 blend, when you plant the bulbs and every spring thereafter. Avoid using high-nitrogen fertilizers, as they promote excessive leaf growth at the expense of flowers. 5. Mulching: Mulch the area around your lilies to maintain consistent soil moisture and temperature, while also discouraging the growth of weeds. Use organic mulch materials, like shredded leaves or bark, to help further enrich the soil. 6. Staking: Some lily varieties have tall, slender stems that may require staking for support. Use a gentle stake or plant support to prevent the stem from breaking or bending. 7. Pruning: Deadhead faded blooms to promote more flowering and maintain a tidy appearance. When cutting flowers for arrangements, be careful not to remove too many leaves from the plant to ensure it retains the energy necessary for bulb development. 8. Pest and disease control: Keep an eye out for aphids, slugs, and other pests that can affect your lilies. Use natural pest control methods or insecticides when needed. Also, be mindful of diseases such as lily mosaic virus and botrytis, and take appropriate measures to keep your plants healthy. 9. Winter care: In colder climates, protect your lily bulbs from freezing temperatures by applying a thick layer of mulch before the ground freezes. Remove the mulch in early spring when the risk of frost has passed. By following these comprehensive care steps and choosing the appropriate location with good drainage and sufficient sunlight, you can ensure your lilies will grow healthily and produce beautiful blooms for you to enjoy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These touchdowns were scored through a blocked punt recovery, an interception return, and a punt return. Despite the lead they established early in the game, they were unable to maintain it due to effective defensive strategies from the Niners that prevented the Eagles' offense - which had led the league in scoring through the first 3 weeks of the season - from contributing any points to their score. The Niners came back in the second half, countered by two touchdown passes by Colin Kaepernick and four field goals by Phil Dawson, eventually taking the lead with a score of 26-21. Towards the end of the game, the Eagles had an opportunity to shift the balance as they moved to the Niner's one-yard line, but this potential was unfulfilled as they turned over the ball on downs.

A:","completion":"Based on the review provided, the customer appears to be highly dissatisfied with their experience reading the book 'Silent Joe.' There are several factors indicating their level of dissatisfaction, which are outlined below: 1. Negative overall tone: The review begins with a strong negative statement, asserting that it is \\"one of the worst books\\" the customer has read. This opinion sets an overwhelmingly negative tone for the rest of the review. 2. Questioning positive reviews: The customer expresses skepticism about the 43 5-star reviews the book has received, suggesting that the author’s extended family might have written them. This insinuates that the customer not only dislikes the book but also doubts others' genuine appreciation for it. 3. Mentioning numerous formatting errors: The customer details a significant amount of formatting issues they encountered while reading, citing more than a hundred missing periods, commas, and quotation marks. Such errors would likely disrupt the reading experience and may contribute to the customer's overall dissatisfaction with the book. 4. Criticizing the use of spellcheck: The customer goes on to express their frustration with the book's numerous spelling and grammar errors, which they liken to auto-correct mistakes. They also mention encountering these errors \\"time after time,\\" suggesting that the prevalence of these issues made it challenging to enjoy the book. 5. Claiming that the book is not worth it, even for free: The review ends with the customer stating that the book \\"wasn't worth it\\" despite being a free Kindle book. By asserting that the book holds no value, even when offered at no cost, the customer demonstrates a strongly negative opinion and high level of dissatisfaction with their reading experience. In conclusion, with the negative tone, questioning of positive reviews, highlighting of formatting and spellcheck issues, and a strong statement that the book wasn't worth their time, we can confidently determine that the customer who left this review was thoroughly dissatisfied with 'Silent Joe.'"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Le principe d'égalité et de non-discrimination est un concept fondamental dans les sociétés démocratiques et constitue la base de nombreuses lois et réglementations. Il s'agit essentiellement de garantir que chaque individu soit traité de manière équitable et égale, quelle que soit sa race, son sexe, son origine ethnique, sa religion, son handicap, son orientation sexuelle ou toute autre caractéristique personnelle. Ce principe revêt une grande importance, car il témoigne du respect et de la dignité humaine, permettant ainsi une coexistence harmonieuse et pacifique parmi les différentes communautés. La non-discrimination est un élément clé de ce principe et vise à garantir que toutes les personnes bénéficient des mêmes droits et opportunités, sans discrimination ni préférence injustifiée. Cela signifie que chaque individu doit avoir un accès égal aux ressources, aux services et aux décisions qui ont un impact sur sa vie, tout en ayant le droit d'être protégé contre le harcèlement, la violence et toute autre forme de mauvais traitement. Dans cette optique, le principe d'égalité et de non-discrimination peut être abordé de différentes manières en fonction du contexte et des besoins spécifiques. Par exemple, cela peut se traduire par la mise en place de mesures d'égalité des chances et de diversité en milieu professionnel, l'élaboration de politiques publiques favorisant l'égalité d'accès à l'éducation et à la santé, la lutte contre les discriminations et les préjugés, ainsi que la promotion de l'égalité des droits pour les groupes marginalisés et défavorisés. En outre, de nombreuses organisations et institutions internationales, telles que les Nations Unies, l'Union européenne et d'autres organisations régionales, ont adopté des conventions, des directives et des normes visant à promouvoir et à protéger le principe d'égalité et de non-discrimination au niveau mondial. Par exemple, la Déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme, le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques et la Convention sur l'élimination de toutes les formes de discrimination à l'égard des femmes sont autant de textes qui incarnent ce principe et prévoient des mécanismes pour assurer son respect et sa mise en œuvre. En résumé, le principe d'égalité et de non-discrimination est un pilier important des sociétés démocratiques et justes, qui s'efforcent de garantir l'égalité des chances, la dignité et le respect pour tous les individus, indépendamment de leurs caractéristiques personnelles ou de leur appartenance à un groupe particulier. Il est essentiel de continuer à promouvoir et à protéger ce principe en élaborant des politiques publiques, des réglementations et des initiatives qui visent à renforcer l'égalité, à lutter contre la discrimination et à garantir un traitement équitable pour tous.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors. But I can use this background: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases. What is an answer for this question: Which student read more about reactant particles being heated? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the information given in the question The user provided information about two colleagues studying different aspects of chemical reactions: Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions, and Gabe studied about other influencing factors.

Step 2: Relate the given background information to the students We can see that the background information provided by the user is specifically related to the effect of temperature on chemical reactions, discussing how heating the reactant particles influences reaction rates. Step 3: Determine which student's study topic is more directly related to the background information Sean's study topic was the influence of temperature on chemical reactions, which is explicitly focused on the scenario described in the background information.

What was the old process to bleach before it's invention? Question 2: How do I bleach my hair without bleach? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: Who discovered bleaching powder? What was the old process to bleach before its invention? The Scottish chemist, Charles Tennant, discovered bleaching powder, also known as calcium hypochlorite, in the year 1798. Tennant initially produced the compound by reacting slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) with chlorine gas. The resulting substance, bleaching powder, revolutionized the textile industry due to its superior ability to remove color from fabrics, making the process of bleaching an easier and more efficient undertaking. Prior to the invention of bleaching powder, the most common method of bleaching fabrics was using a process called \\"sun-bleaching,\\" which required exposing the materials to direct sunlight for an extended period. This method was both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Additionally, another method called \\"souring\\" was used, which involved soaking the fabrics in a diluted solution of lactic or sulfuric acid. Both sun-bleaching and souring were far less efficient than what bleaching powder could offer and came with certain limitations in their effectiveness. Question 2: How do I bleach my hair without bleach? Bleaching your hair without using bleach can be done in various ways by using alternative ingredients or methods, although the results might not be as drastic or long-lasting as using a bleach solution. Some of the options to lighten hair without bleach are: 1. Lemon Juice – Lemon juice has natural citric acid which can help lighten hair. Mix equal parts of lemon juice and with water, spray it onto your hair, and comb through to ensure even distribution. Expose your hair to sunlight, and let it sit for 2-3 hours before taking a shower. You might need to repeat this method a few times to see significant lightening. 2. Honey – Honey is a natural lightening agent and also works as a moisturizer, leaving your hair healthy. Mix honey and water (or apple cider vinegar for better results) and apply it to your hair. Leave the mixture for about an hour before washing it out. 3. Cinnamon: Mixing cinnamon with a moisturizing hair conditioner could help lighten your hair. Apply the mixture to your hair, cover with a shower cap, and leave it overnight. Rinse it off in the morning. 4. Apple Cider Vinegar – Apple cider vinegar is known for lightening hair over time. Dilute it with water and use it as a hair rinse after shampooing. This method requires consistent application to notice significant results. 5. Chamomile Tea – Rinsing your hair with chamomile tea can result in a subtle lightening effect. Brew strong chamomile tea, let it cool, and rinse your hair with it after shampooing. It is important to note that these methods may have varying results depending on your hair type, color, and texture. Regarding whether questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing: No, these questions are not the same. Question 1 is asking about the discovery of bleaching powder and how fabrics were bleached before its invention. Meanwhile, Question 2 is asking for alternatives to bleach when lightening hair. Although both questions involve the concept of \\"bleaching,\\" they focus on different subjects, one on the textile industry and the other on hair care."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the first building at Covent Garden? ? The central square in Covent Garden is simply called \\"Covent Garden\\", often marketed as \\"Covent Garden Piazza\\" to distinguish it from the eponymous surrounding area. Designed and laid out in 1630, it was the first modern square in London—originally a flat, open space or piazza with low railings. From about 1635 onwards there were many private residents of note, including the nobility, living in the Great Piazza. A casual market started on the south side, and by 1830 the present market hall had been built. The space is popular with street performers, who audition with the site's owners for an allocated slot. The square was originally laid out when the 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell, commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around the site of a former walled garden belonging to Westminster Abbey. Jones's design was informed by his knowledge of modern town planning in Europe, particularly Piazza d'Arme, in Leghorn, Tuscany, Piazza San Marco in Venice, Piazza Santissima Annunziata in Florence, and the Place des Vosges in Paris. The centrepiece of the project was the large square, the concept of which was new to London, and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew, acting as the prototype for the design of new estates, such as the Ladbroke Estate and the Grosvenor Estate. Isaac de Caus, the French Huguenot architect, designed the individual houses under Jones's overall design.The church of St Paul's was the first building, and was begun in July 1631 on the western side of the square. The last house was completed in 1637. Seventeen of the houses had arcaded portico walks organised in groups of four and six either side of James Street on the north side, and three and four either side of Russell Street. These arcades, rather than the square itself, took the name Piazza; the group from James Street to Russell Street became known as the \\"Great Piazza\\" and that to the south of Russell Street as the \\"Little Piazza\\".

The answer is:","completion":"The time constraint that a pope can reveal the identity of an in pectore cardinal is not fixed and depends on the specific conditions and circumstances surrounding the appointment. The pope may choose to reveal the identity of the cardinal at any time, if he judges that it is safe and appropriate to do so. This decision is typically based on factors such as political or religious circumstances, safety concerns for the individual in question, or any other factors that may have initially prompted the in pectore appointment. Once the pope reveals the identity of the in pectore cardinal, the cardinal ranks in precedence with those who were raised to the cardinalate at the time of his initial in pectore appointment. This means that he assumes the same rights, privileges, and responsibilities as other cardinals within the Church hierarchy, despite not having been publicly acknowledged as such earlier. It is important to note that if a pope dies before revealing the identity of an in pectore cardinal, the cardinalate expires and the individual does not become a public cardinal. In such cases, the in pectore appointment essentially becomes null and void, as the decision to reveal or not reveal the identity ultimately lies with the reigning pope and does not pass on to his successors.

Summarize the following: Some foods reduce inflammation in your body, which is helpful for reducing your psoriasis flare-ups and relieving existing symptoms. Base your meals around fresh produce, fatty fish, beans, nuts, and legumes. Cook your foods using healthy oils, and season your dishes with fresh herbs and spices. Choose fruit for your snacks or desserts. The best vegetable options include leafy greens, broccoli, beets, celery, cabbage, carrots, peas, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, and bok choy. Healthy oils include olive oil, borage oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, grapeseed oil, and avocado oil. Anti-inflammatory herbs include cayenne pepper, ginger, cloves, and turmeric. Omega-3 fatty acids help reduce inflammation in your body, so they can help reduce your risk of flare-ups. They also support your immune system! Choose foods high in omega-3s at least 3-4 times per week. Good sources of omega-3s include fatty fish (such as salmon, cod, or halibut), nuts, vegetable oils, flaxseeds, flaxseed oil, and leafy vegetables. You can also take an omega-3 fish oil supplement. However, talk to your doctor before taking any supplements. Red meat can trigger flare-ups because it causes inflammation in your body, so it's best to avoid it. Instead, choose leaner proteins like chicken, fish, tofu, and beans. If you enjoy eating red meat, choose lean cuts of meat like sirloin, round, or loin. Before you cook the meat, make sure you cut off as much fat as possible. Processed foods that are high in sodium, sugar, and trans fats trigger inflammation in your body. This can cause flare-ups. Stay away from baked goods, packaged snacks, frozen dinners, canned soups, and deli meats. Instead, choose fresh, whole foods. Although they are lightly processed, frozen meats, frozen vegetables, and whole grains can be a healthy addition to your diet. Sugar can also cause inflammation, so it's important to keep it to a minimum. Cut out baked goods, candy, ice cream, and other treats. Additionally, read food labels to look out for added sugars. When you want a yummy treat, opt for a piece of fruit instead of a sugary snack. If you're sensitive to dairy, switch to non-dairy products, like soy milk or almond milk. In addition to milk replacements, you can find non-dairy yogurt and ice cream. Not everyone is triggered by dairy. If it doesn't seem to affect you, dairy can be a healthy part of your diet. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease, so a healthy immune system can help reduce flare-ups. Probiotics help balance the healthy bacteria in your body. You can find them in yogurt and fermented foods. As another option, you can take a probiotics supplement. If you can eat yogurt without triggering your psoriasis, it can be a convenient, easy way to get more probiotics in your diet. Fermented foods you can try include sauerkraut, kimchi, kombucha, miso, tempeh, and kefir. Turmeric, which is packed with antioxidants, relieves inflammation in your body. It can help reduce your psoriasis flare-ups, as well as relieve your symptoms if you're already experiencing a flare-up. You can add turmeric to your dishes as a spice to increase your consumption. If you don't like the taste of turmeric, you can take it as a supplement. Talk to your doctor before you take any supplements. by drinking at least 11.5 cups (2.7 L) daily. Water helps flush out your system and is part of your body's natural detox process. How much water you need daily will depend on your age, gender, and activity levels. If you feel thirsty or have dark urine, increase your fluid intake. In general, women need about 11.5 cups (2.7 L) of water each day, while men need 15.5 cups (3.7 L) of water daily. You don't have to just drink water! Fluids like tea, juice, soup broth, smoothies, etc. all contribute to your water intake.","completion":"The text states that certain foods can help reduce inflammation in the body, which mitigates psoriasis flare-ups and alleviates existing symptoms. It's recommended to base meals around fresh produce, fatty fish, beans, nuts, and legumes. You should cook food using healthy oils such as olive oil, borage oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, grapeseed oil, and avocado oil, and season dishes with fresh herbs and anti-inflammatory spices like cayenne pepper, ginger, cloves, and turmeric. Consuming fruits as snacks or desserts is considered beneficial. Vegetables that are particularly recommended include leafy greens, broccoli, beets, and a variety of others such as celery, cabbage, carrots, peas, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, and bok choy. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential as they help reduce inflammation in the body and support the immune system. They can be found in fatty fish, nuts, vegetable oils, flaxseeds, flaxseed oil, and leafy vegetables, and should be consumed 3-4 times a week. However, certain types of food can trigger psoriasis flare-ups and should be avoided. These include red meat because it causes inflammation, and processed foods that are high in sodium, sugar, and trans fats. Instead, leaner proteins such as chicken, fish, tofu, and beans are recommended, as well as fresh, whole foods. While some lightly processed foods like frozen meats, vegetables, and whole grains can be included in the diet, it is essential to eliminate or severely reduce sugar intake. Dairy sensitivity can trigger psoriasis in some individuals, so non-dairy alternatives such as soy or almond milk, non-dairy yogurt, and ice cream are suggested for them. Probiotics are recommended for all as they help balance healthy bacteria, supporting the immune system, which can help reduce psoriasis flare-ups. Probiotics can be found in yogurt and fermented foods or supplements. The spice turmeric is highlighted as particularly beneficial due to its antioxidant properties, which help reduce inflammation, thereby reducing psoriasis flare-ups. It can be consumed through cooking or as a supplement, although the latter should only be taken after consulting with a doctor. Additionally, drinking plenty of fluids, particularly water, is essential for detoxifying the body. Women are advised to drink 11.5 cups of fluids daily, while men should aim for 15.5 cups. Fluids such as tea, juice, soup broth, and smoothies also contribute to the daily fluid intake. Individual needs will vary based on factors like age, gender, and activity levels, but an increase in fluid intake is necessary when feeling thirsty or having dark-colored urine."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Usage: Given that the agent asks for the customer's name to proceed further, a possible response here that meets this criteria could be the customer saying \\"My name is John Doe.\\" This is because it directly answers the agent's prior question. Part #2: Avoiding usage of irrelevant extra information. Usage: \\"Just call me John.\\" This response avoids adding unnecessary information such as where John is from or what he does for a living, focusing solely on providing his name as per the agent's request. Part #3: Making sure the response is relevant to the question before the blank.

Answer the following question: Process: - A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain - Miners enter the mine - Miners remove the coal from the mine - The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt - The coal is moved up to the surface - The coal is loaded onto a truck - The truck takes the coal to a power station. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less coal is loaded happens, how will it affect LESS coal arriving at the power station. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this scenario suggests that if less coal is loaded onto the trucks, it will result in less coal arriving at the power station. To analyze the effect of this perturbation, we can break it down step-by-step to determine the direct and indirect impacts on the overall process. 1. A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain: The perturbation does not have any direct or indirect effect on this step, as the mine's excavation is independent of the quantity of coal loaded onto the trucks. 2. Miners enter the mine: Similarly, the perturbation does not affect this step, as miners entering the mine are not influenced by the quantity of coal loaded onto the trucks. 3. Miners remove the coal from the mine: The perturbation hypothesis might have an indirect effect on this step. If less coal is loaded onto the trucks, it could potentially indicate lower demand or a slower removal process. In such cases, the miners may remove coal at a decreased rate. 4. The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt: The perturbation hypothesis can have a direct effect on this step. If less coal is loaded onto the trucks, it would naturally mean that fewer carts or a shorter conveyor belt are necessary to hold the transported coal. 5. The coal is moved up to the surface: The perturbation has a direct effect on this step, as moving less coal to the surface means that coal extraction operates at a reduced rate or that there is less demand for the coal at the power station. 6. The coal is loaded onto a truck: This is the step where the perturbation has a direct effect. Loading less coal onto the truck means reduced transportation capacity or lower overall demand for coal at the power station. 7. The truck takes the coal to a power station: The perturbation hypothesis has a direct effect on this step. With less coal being transported, the power station will receive a lesser amount of coal, which could result in decreased energy production or even stoppage if the coal supply is insufficient. In summary, the proposed perturbation of loading less coal onto trucks will have a direct effect on the process in terms of coal transportation to the power station and potential impacts on energy production. It may also have indirect effects on other steps in the process, such as the removal of coal from the mine if it indicates lower demand or a decreased rate of removal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Taste the dish: Before you begin, taste the dish to get a sense of its flavors. This will help you identify which flavors are already present and which ones could use a boost. 2. Use fresh ingredients: Whenever possible, use fresh ingredients instead of dried or canned ones. Fresh herbs, spices, fruits, and vegetables tend to have a stronger and more vibrant taste compared to their dried or canned counterparts. 3. Season with salt and pepper: Add salt and pepper to the dish. Salt helps to enhance the natural flavors of the food, while pepper adds a subtle heat and sharpness. Start with a small amount and adjust according to taste. 4. Balance flavors: Balance the flavors in your dish by considering the five basic tastes – sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. Adjust the dish accordingly by adding a bit of sugar or honey for sweetness, lemon juice or vinegar for acidity, soy sauce or fish sauce for umami, or even a dash of bitter ingredients like cocoa or coffee. 5. Add aromatic ingredients: Aromatic ingredients such as garlic, onion, herbs, and spices can help accentuate flavors in a dish. Be sure to sauté or toast your aromatics before adding them to the dish to release their essential oils and enhance their flavor. 6. Use fats: Fats, like butter or oil, can help to carry flavor throughout the dish. They can also give a richer mouthfeel, enhancing the overall taste and texture. Use fats judiciously to support the flavors without overpowering the dish. 7. Layer flavors: Add ingredients at different stages of the cooking process to build complexity and depth of flavor. For example, add some fresh herbs during cooking and then finish the dish with a sprinkle of the same herb to create layers of flavor. 8. Adjust cooking methods: Different cooking methods can bring out different flavors in ingredients. For instance, roasting vegetables can caramelize their natural sugars, while searing meat can create a flavorful crust that enhances taste. 9. Add acidity: An acidic element, such as vinegar, citrus juice, or wine, can help brighten the flavors of a dish and make them more pronounced. Add a small amount at a time, tasting as you go, to achieve the desired effect. 10. Allow the dish to rest: After you've made adjustments to the flavors of your dish, allow it to rest for a short period before serving. This will give the flavors time to meld and strengthen. By following these steps, you can accentuate the flavors in your dish, ensuring that they are bold, balanced, and delicious. Remember to taste your dish periodically during the cooking process and make adjustments as needed to create a harmonious and flavorful dish."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He rehires Fred and makes him his new partner , then goes to the Cratchit house where he visits Bob and increases his wages .","completion":"While these two sentences share similarities and convey similar ideas, they are not exactly identical in meaning. Let's break down the differences and similarities between the two: Similarities: 1. Both sentences involve interacting with Fred and making him a new partner. 2. Both sentences mention going to the Cratchit house. 3. Both sentences discuss an improvement in conditions for Bob (the first refers to him as \\"Bob,\\" and the second refers to him as \\"the Cratchit\\"). Differences: 1. In the first sentence, the subject \\"he\\" visits Fred, while in the second sentence, he \\"rehires\\" Fred. The term \\"rehire\\" implies that Fred was previously employed by the subject and is now being brought back onboard, while \\"visits\\" does not imply any prior employment relationship. 2. In the first sentence, the subject goes to the Cratchit house and \\"restores\\" Bob. This phrasing suggests that Bob may have been in a worse situation previously, and the subject makes it right by \\"restoring\\" him. The second sentence doesn't convey the same intensity, as it simply mentions that the subject \\"visits\\" Bob at the Cratchit house without any implications of repairing a situation. 3. In the first sentence, the subject increases Bob's \\"reward.\\" This phrase is more ambiguous in its meaning compared to the second sentence, which explicitly states that Bob's \\"wages\\" are increased. The term \\"reward\\" could potentially refer to any form of compensation or benefit that Bob receives, while \\"wages\\" specifically refers to monetary compensation for employment.

Before you can train your dog or cat out of sleeping on the couch or bed, you'll need to give your pet a comfortable alternative. You probably won't have much luck keeping your pet off the furniture if you don't provide some kind of alternative.","completion":"Purchase a pet bed that suits your furry friend's size and preferences. Some pets like to stretch out, while others prefer a more enclosed, cave-like space. Observe your pet's sleeping habits to determine what type of bed would best suit their needs. Also, consider their age and any health issues they may have – older pets and those with joint problems may benefit from a more cushioned, supportive bed to provide relief. Place their new bed in an area that is safe, quiet, and familiar to them. This will help make the bed more enticing and become their preferred sleeping spot. Introduce the new bed to your pet. Once you've chosen the perfect bed, introduce it to your pet slowly. Let them sniff it and explore it, and provide praise and treats when they show interest in it. Building a positive association with the bed early on will encourage your pet to choose it as their sleeping spot in the future. Implement consistent training techniques. Consistency is key when it comes to training your pet to stay off the furniture. Incorporate the use of commands such as \\"off\\" or \\"down\\" if your pet tries to jump onto the furniture. Be sure to reward them with praise and treats when they comply and redirect them to their pet bed. Remember not to scold or punish your pet during this process, as it may reinforce negative associations and hinder your progress. Create barriers to keep your pet off the furniture. If your pet is persistent in their attempts to use your furniture, consider using deterrents such as furniture covers, tin foil, or plastic mats with spikes on the surface. These will make the furniture less appealing and will help reinforce your training efforts. Alternatively, you could use baby gates or pet playpens to limit your pet's access to certain rooms when you're not able to supervise them. Use positive reinforcement and rewards. Reinforcing your pet's good behavior with praise, treats, and affection will make it more likely for them to continue choosing their bed over your furniture. Make a habit of rewarding your pet when you catch them using their designated sleeping area, and try to make their bed as comfortable and appealing as possible by placing toys, blankets, or even an item of your clothing nearby to create a familiar scent. Involve the entire household in the training process. In order for your pet to understand that the furniture is off-limits, it's crucial for everyone in the household to be on the same page about enforcing the rule.

Summarize this article: When you’re nervous, your muscles lock up and your breathing gets irregular, which can negatively impact your performance. To counteract this, close your eyes and take big, deep breaths to relax. Hold the breath for 3-5 seconds, then slowly let it out. Stage fright is natural, and something that many performers struggle with. One thing not to do when you’re nervous is to run away from the feeling—that makes it seem even scarier. Instead, take a step back and look at your anxiety objectively. Tell yourself your nerves are normal and OK to have, and that they can even make you a better performer! Being nervous isn’t something to be afraid of. It might not feel comfortable, but you know you’re strong enough to handle the discomfort and perform your best anyway. For example, you could tell yourself, “This is a big recital, so of course I’m nervous. That’s OK. I’m going to perform the best I can anyway.” with focused, positive thoughts about the performance. Being nervous means that you have adrenaline coursing through your body, and that can be a good thing before a big performance. Instead of allowing that adrenaline to run wild and make you nervous and worried, focus it into positive thoughts and actions to boost your confidence. For example, you could channel your adrenaline into physical movement, such as drumming your fingers or nodding your head. You could also walk or even dance around to get out your jitters. Mentally, use your energy to acknowledge your worried thoughts, then turn towards excited, upbeat ones. Think about how hard you’ve worked for this, how excited you are, and how ready you feel. Many performers find that some healthy pre-show jitters give them the burst of adrenaline they need to give an amazing show. Embrace your nerves as a way to help you perform your best. Bad nerves can sometimes send you into a worry spiral that’s hard to break out of. Stop the cycle before it starts by first noticing when you begin to worry. Stop yourself and accept that you feel nervous, but that that feeling doesn’t have to control you. For example, you might find yourself thinking something like, “I’m not prepared for this. I’m going to mess everything up.” Instead of continuing in this vein, say, “This just means I have some nerves. I practiced hard for this. It’s natural to be nervous, but it doesn’t mean I’m going to mess up.” If you’re worrying about past mistakes or failures, try saying to yourself, “I’ve worked hard since then and learned from mistakes. I’ve improved a lot, and now I get the chance to show it.” Sit or stand in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Picture yourself giving a great performance, and let yourself feel those emotions—confidence, strength, elation, and more. Letting that image fill you up will give you the boost of confidence you need to make it a reality. Positive visualization has been proven to improve performance in many different arenas, so give it a shot! You still might feel a rush of nerves when you step onstage. Instead of freezing up, channel that nervous energy into a big smile or an enthusiastic wave or gesture. This is a great way to cover up your anxiety while connecting with the audience. If you’re a musician, you could smile, nod to the crowd, and walk briskly to your spot. In less formal settings, you could even jump around or run onstage. If you’re acting or giving a speech, walk on confidently and in character. If you’re dancing, walk onstage as you’ve rehearsed, smiling or looking confidently at the crowd if it matches the mood of your performance.","completion":"If you ever feel nervous before an important event like a show or a speech, it's totally okay. Everyone gets nervous. When you get nervous, your body might feel tight and your breathing might feel funny. But did you know, you can actually control this? By simply breathing slowly, deeply and closing your eyes, you can help relax your body. Remember, being nervous isn't bad! It just means your body is getting ready for something exciting. In fact, nerves can make you do better! When you feel jumpy or wiggly because you're nervous, instead of letting that scare you, make it work for you. You can move around, like tapping your fingers, or imagining yourself doing great in your performance. This can help you feel better. If you find yourself getting worried, stop and remind yourself that it's okay to be nervous. You've worked hard and prepared, so you don't have to worry about messing up. You can even pretend that you're not nervous by smiling or waving when you get on stage or start your performance. Remember, even if you are feeling a little bit nervous, it doesn't mean you're not ready. You can still do great!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave.

The Australian rescue operators said the scientists and tourists were now all aboard the ship Aurora Australis. They were flown there in groups by a helicopter from a Chinese ice-breaker. The Shokalskiy has been trapped since 24 December. Its 22 crew are expected to remain on board to wait until the vessel becomes free. The Shokalskiy was trapped by thick sheets of ice driven by strong winds, about 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart - the capital of the Australian state of Tasmania. The vessel was being used by the Australasian Antarctic Expedition to follow the route explorer Douglas Mawson travelled a century ago. 'White-knuckle ride' \\"We've made it to the Aurora australis safe & sound. A huge thanks to the Chinese & @AusAntarctic for all their hard work!,\\" expedition leader Chris Turney tweeted. The helicopter belongs to the Chinese icebreaker, Xue Long, and each flight took about 45 minutes, round-trip.

But it later reported: \\"Aurora Australis has advised Amsa that the 52 passengers from the Akademik Shokalskiy are now on board.\\" The passengers are not expected back in Tasmania until mid-January. Several attempts to break through to the ship by sea - by the Xue Long, Aurora Australis and French-flagged L'Astrolabe - failed because of the thickness of the ice. Andrew Luck-Baker says the Aurora Australis, although big, was simply not up to the task and there is speculation two larger vessels may be coming to the area in the weeks to come. Despite being trapped, the scientists continued their experiments, measuring temperature and salinity through cracks in the surrounding ice. One of the aims was to track how quickly the Antarctic's sea ice was disappearing. The ship had plenty of stocks and was never in danger. ||||| CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — A long-awaited rescue of passengers on board a research ship that has been trapped in Antarctic ice for more than a week finally got underway on Thursday, with a helicopter scooping up the first group of passengers and flying them to a nearby vessel, expedition leaders said.

(Associated Press) In this Tuesday, Dec. 31, 2013 image provided by Australasian Antarctic Expedition/Footloose Fotography, passengers from the Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalskiy link arms and stamp out a helicopter landing... (Associated Press) The helicopter was originally going to airlift the passengers to a Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, with a barge then ferrying them to an Australian vessel. But sea ice was preventing a barge from reaching the Snow Dragon, and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's Rescue Coordination Centre, which is overseeing the rescue, said the operation would consequently be delayed. A last-minute change in plans allowed the rescue to go ahead. The 52 scientists and tourists on board were instead being flown to an ice floe next to the Australian icebreaker the Aurora Australis, and then taken by a small boat to the Australian ship, expedition leader Chris Turney said. The maritime authority confirmed the first group arrived at the Aurora Thursday evening. \\"I think everyone is relieved and excited to be going on to the Australian icebreaker and then home,\\" Turney told The Associated Press by satellite phone from the Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalski, which has been stuck in the ice since Christmas Eve. The helicopter will carry the passengers a dozen at a time in an operation expected to take five hours. All 22 crew members are planning to stay with their icebound vessel, which is not in danger. The Aurora will carry the passengers to the Australian island state of Tasmania, arriving by mid-January. The eagerly anticipated rescue came after days of failed attempts to reach the ship. Blinding snow, strong winds, fog and thick sea ice forced rescuers to turn back time and again. Three icebreakers were initially dispatched to try and crack their way through the ice surrounding the vessel, but all failed. The Aurora came within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the ship Monday, but fierce winds and snow forced it to retreat to open water. The Akademik Shokalskiy, which left New Zealand on Nov. 28, got stuck after a blizzard pushed the sea ice around the ship, freezing it in place about 2,700 kilometers (1,700 miles) south of Hobart, Tasmania. The ship isn't in danger of sinking and has weeks' worth of supplies on board, but it cannot move. The scientific team on board had been recreating Australian explorer Douglas Mawson's 1911 to 1913 voyage to Antarctica. Turney had hoped to continue the trip if an icebreaker managed to free the ship. __ Associated Press writer Kristen Gelineau in Sydney contributed to this report. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Rescuers in Antarctica have safely transferred all 52 passengers stranded on the ice-bound research vessel Akademik Shokalskiy to the ship Aurora Australis.

He arrived at Donauwörth on the 17th to find the Grande Armée in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by 75 miles (121 km) and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia.

Answer the following question: Everybody knew Shandor Marley's mother liked to spend more time flirting with serial killers than she did taking care of things at home. So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows. He had a hand on the door before he knew for sure it was still lived-in. He flapped thunderbugs off his forearm and creaked open the door.

Kayla spent more on her new car.. [2]. Lindsey spent more on her new car..","completion":"[2]. Lindsey spent more on her new car. Although both Kayla and Lindsey had their hearts set on purchasing new cars, their financial situations were vastly different. Kayla, a recent college graduate, had just started her professional journey in the marketing field. As an entry-level employee, her paycheck was not as substantial as that of Lindsey, who had laid the foundation of a successful career in finance years prior. Lindsey had steadily climbed the corporate ladder, earning multiple promotions and securing several high-profile clients. Her experience enabled her to negotiate a well-deserved salary which was significantly higher than that of Kayla. Thus, Lindsey could afford the luxury of splurging on the newest, high-end vehicles available in the market. Kayla, on the other hand, had to tread carefully when it came to spending on a new car. Saddled with student loans and adjusting to the reality of living on her own, Kayla couldn't let her dreams of driving a luxury car blind her to the financial responsibilities she had to prioritize. As such, she opted for a more modest and affordable car that would provide her with reliable transportation without breaking the bank. Meanwhile, Lindsey had her eyes set on a sleek, top-of-the-line car that matched her high-end lifestyle. After diligent research and multiple test drives, Lindsey decided on a gorgeous sports car with cutting-edge technology, impressive horsepower, and an eye-catching design. This car not only portrayed her success but also demonstrated her sharp taste in automobiles. With her larger budget, Lindsey was able to follow through with her purchase, ultimately spending significantly more than Kayla on a new car. Despite their spending disparity, both Kayla and Lindsey were content with their choices. While Kayla understood that she had to make certain sacrifices at the beginning of her career, she remained hopeful that with hard work and determination, she would eventually advance in her field and have the financial means to upgrade her vehicle in the future. In the meantime, she appreciated her dependable car and its fuel efficiency, which allowed her to save money and allocate her resources toward other essential expenses. Lindsey, on the other hand, was proud of her accomplishments and the position she had earned in her field. Her new car, a symbol of her hard work and ambition, inspired her to continue striving for professional growth and seizing every opportunity that came her way. In conclusion, while Kayla made much less money than Lindsey, it was Lindsey who spent more on her new car. Their contrasting financial situations resulted in different purchasing approaches, yet both women were content with their choices and remained optimistic about achieving their respective personal and professional aspirations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

There are now about 376 million people who speak English as their first language, and about the same number who have learnt it in addition to their mother tongue. There are said to be one billion people learning English now and about 80% of the information on the Internet is in English. Is this a good thing, or a bad thing? Should we celebrate the fact that more and more of us can communicate, using a common language, across countries and cultures? Or should we worry about the dangers of \\" mono-culturalism\\", a world in which we all speak the same language, eat the same food and listen to the same music?

I bought it mainly to brown meat, and maybe I shouldn't have attempted to fry potatoes in it, but I still have brown spots on the enamel from my first cooking expedition. Frying potatoes and browning meat, though, is a similar process so my impression is that this is a cheap dutch oven. My friend has a Le Crueset pot that this doesn't happen to. It's probably best for simmering stews and sauces, but I'd rather use my stainless steel pots which heat evenly, don't weigh 20 pounds, and are easy to clean.

The six-member delegation -- including chief inspector Herman Nackaerts and second-in-command Rafael Grossi -- arrived in Tehran shortly after the European Union imposed new sanctions on Iran aimed at cutting off funding to the Islamic republic's nuclear program. Australia and the United States have also ramped up sanctions on Iran recently. Western powers believe Tehran is trying to develop nuclear weapons, an assertion Iran denies.

Use this fact to answer the question: landfills have a negative impact on the environment What have a negative impact on the environment?","completion":"Landfills have a negative impact on the environment. A landfill is a designated area or site for the disposal of waste materials, typically originating from households, industries, and construction sites. These waste materials are often non-biodegradable or take a long time to break down, which contributes to a range of environmental concerns affecting the planet. The negative impacts of landfills on the environment can be broadly categorized into the following areas: 1. Air pollution: Landfills produce harmful gases, including methane and carbon dioxide, as waste materials decompose. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming, while carbon dioxide also exacerbates the greenhouse effect, leading to climate change. In addition, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released from some waste materials, causing offensive odors and potentially contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone. 2. Soil contamination: Landfills can contaminate the soil in several ways. When rainwater filters through the waste materials, it forms a contaminated liquid known as leachate. This toxic liquid can seep into the soil and affect the chemical balance, potentially harming ecosystems and local plant life. Furthermore, some waste materials contain hazardous chemicals, heavy metals, and pathogens that can leach into the soil and pose a threat to human health and the environment. 3. Water pollution: Contaminated leachate from landfills can also pollute nearby rivers, lakes, and groundwater. This negatively impacts aquatic ecosystems, jeopardizing the survival of plants, fish, and other species. Moreover, water pollution can compromise the quality of drinking water in nearby communities, posing serious health risks to humans and wildlife. 4. Loss of biodiversity: As landfills often occupy vast areas of land, the construction and expansion of these sites lead to habitat destruction and fragmentation. This can, in turn, result in loss of biodiversity, endangering plant and animal species, and disrupting the balance of local ecosystems. 5. Increased carbon footprint: The transport and disposal of waste materials in landfills contribute to an increased carbon footprint, as fossil fuel-powered vehicles emit greenhouse gases when transporting waste to these sites. 6. Resource depletion: Landfills contribute to the squandering of valuable resources that could otherwise be reused, recycled, or repurposed. Disposing of waste in landfills instead of finding ways to recycle or reduce waste generation exacerbates resource scarcity. To mitigate these negative environmental impacts, communities should adopt sustainable waste management practices. These may include reducing waste generated at the source, promoting recycling and composting, utilizing alternative waste disposal technologies (such as waste-to-energy facilities), and implementing better landfill design and management techniques. By addressing these issues, it is possible to lessen the negative environmental consequences associated with landfills and secure a healthier future for our planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: Many random citizens would use an entrance hall to enter this sort of building. What is it? Options: - school - public building - large building - auditorum - convention center Explain why a human would choose \\"public building\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"The task here requires understanding of the question and the options provided to justify why a human would choose \\"public building\\". Step 1: Understanding the question The question is asking about a type of building where \\"many random citizens\\" would use an entrance hall to get inside. This implies it's a common place that accommodates a variety of people and not just a specific group. Step 2: Review the given options The options provided are: school, public building, large building, auditorium, and convention center. Step 3: Matching options with the question When we compare these options to the question, we find that while all these buildings could have an entrance hall, not all of them align with the phrase \\"many random citizens\\". - A school is more specific and usually only students, teachers, and staff enter. - A large building could be of any sort, including private offices, which are not used by \\"random citizens\\". - An auditorium and convention center can be correct but these are used for specific events and not all \\"random citizens\\" can access it unless there's an event happening. Step 4: Elimination and final selection Based on the above assessments, \\"public building\\" is the best fit as public buildings are designed for use by the public, i.e., many random citizens. Examples include libraries, hospitals, government buildings, etc. These places are openly accessible and are commonly used by a variety of people, justifying the phrase from the question. So a human would choose \\"public building\\" because it is the most inclusive and common place for random citizens to enter often using an entrance hall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

WHITE HOUSE — The United States is escalating trans-Atlantic and North American trade tensions, imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico beginning on Friday. The U.S. also negotiated quotas or volume limits on other countries, such as South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil, instead of tariffs, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also told reporters Thursday by telephone. China's foreign ministry said on Friday all countries should protect the normal trade order, when asked about U.S. decision. President Donald Trump said Thursday that the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of in trade deals \\"are over'\\" in a harshly worded statement responding to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's criticism of new steel and aluminum tariffs. He intensified his criticism of Canada Friday for what he says are the country's \\"highly restrictive\\" trade practices. Trump has repeatedly said measures such as tariffs are necessary to protect American jobs and industries in key manufacturing sectors. \\"The president's actions are about protecting American steel, American aluminum,\\" a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, said on Fox News. \\"They're critical for national security.\\" But the negative reaction from some of America's most important strategic allies has been quick and fierce. European Union Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said shortly after the tariffs took effect they were illegal and the 28-nation bloc would initiate a settlement dispute case with the World Trade Organization. \\"We can do so. We have the right to do so. I think we must do so, as well, to show that we cannot just take these tariffs and stand silent and we do not accept these kind of imposed illegal tariffs,\\" said Malmstrom. Without elaborating, Malmstrom also said the EU would explore \\"rebalancing measures,\\" which typically are retaliatory actions. Trudeau called the tariffs \\"totally unacceptable\\" and vowed retaliation. \\"This decision is not only unlawful, but it is... According to the above context, answer the following question. After the end of the story, Macron probably is Answer:","completion":"Not specifically mentioned in the given text, French President Emmanuel Macron's probable stance after the end of the story can only be inferred. Based on the trend among leaders of other affected countries such as Canada and EU nations, Macron probably opposed the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by the U.S. Since the tariffs would likely adversely impact France as part of the European Union, it's plausible that he would echo sentiments similar to European Union Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom. He might consider the tariffs illegal and express intent to initiate a settlement dispute case with the World Trade Organization, just as Malmstrom did. Additionally, given the EU's exploration of \\"rebalancing measures,\\" Macron may support or be involved in formulating retaliatory actions against the U.S. to balance out the perceived inequity created by the tariffs. Finally, indirectly speculated upon the basis of President Trump's assertion that the tariffs are necessary to protect American industries, Macron might be concerned about the potential damaging implications for French industries as well as the broader global trade ecosystem. In summary, Macron's probable reaction, based on the landscape sketched out in the given story and barring information to the contrary, would be one of opposition and possible pursuit of countermeasures. He would likely consult closely with EU partners to formulate an effective response. However, the precise nature of Macron's stance is not detailed in the provided text and these assumptions are made through logical reasoning and inference.

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington. Question: \\"Why did the FAA and White House teleconferences fail to stop the plane from hitting the Pentagon?\\" Response: \\"The FAA didn't join until 9:40\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

Court documents filed Monday said Sayyaf and her husband \\"held young women who were sold or traded\\" to ISIS men. The FBI said Umm Sayyaf was interviewed by FBI agents in Iraq in 2015. The agents said that she \\"admitted that her family belonged to al-Qaeda in Iraq\\" and that she took part in holding the women hostage on behalf of ISIS. The agents said she told them that al-Baghdadi \\"owned\\" Mueller during the time of captivity at the Sayyaf home. \\"The defendant admitted that 'owning' is equivalent to slavery,\\" prosecutors said. Mueller and another person traveled into northern Syria on Aug. 3, 2013. On their second full day in the country, they were kidnapped by ISIS soldiers. ISIS leaders notified the Mueller family of her death in an e-mail Feb. 7, 2015. ||||| US federal prosecutors have filed charges against an Iraqi woman accused of holding American aid worker Kayla Mueller hostage before she was killed in Syria. In an affidavit released on Monday, FBI special agent William Heaney charged 25-year-old Nisreen Assad Ibrahim Bahar, also known as Umm Sayyaf, with conspiring to provide material support to Islamic State – an offense that officials allege resulted in Mueller’s death in February 2014. According to the affidavit, which revealed new details about Mueller’s time in captivity, the 26-year-old Arizona woman was abducted at gunpoint by masked Isis soldiers on her second day in Syria in August 2013 and was taken to prison with other hostages. In September 2014, she was then transferred from the Isis prison to the custody of Sayyaf and her husband Abu Sayyaf, also known as Fathi ben Awn ben Jildi Murad al-Tunisi, who is believed to have been a mid-ranking Isis operative who reported directly to the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The Sayyafs held Mueller and other female captives in several residences, handcuffing them and locking them in rooms, the charges reveal. According to the affidavit, Baghdadi abused and raped Mueller along with two other Yazidi women also held captive by the pair. Umm Sayyaf “knew how Mueller was treated by Baghdadi when Mueller was held against her will in Sayyaf’s home”, according to the Justice Department statement on Monday. Umm Sayyaf “threatened the women, telling them she would kill them if they did not listen to her”, the statement continues. Sayyaf also “chastised the captives” by calling them “kafir” and “infidels”, according to the affidavit. The affidavit further alleges that Sayyaf showed “violent ISIL propaganda videos” to Mueller and the other captives, and that young women held by Umm Sayyaf were sold and traded to Isis men. Umm Sayyaf allegedly confessed that she had sole responsibility for Mueller and others while her husband traveled, according to the affidavit, in which she also admitted that Baghdadi “owned” Mueller during her captivity, with “owning” being equivalent to slavery. Mueller had been working to provide support to Syrian refugees. Her death was announced in February 2015, but the circumstances of her death have never been verified by US officials. At the time, the terrorist group had claimed that Mueller was killed during a Jordanian air raid made in retaliation for Islamic State’s gruesome killing of a Jordanian pilot. The group subsequently sent photographs of the dead woman to her family in the US as proof, but her family has said it suspects that Mueller was murdered by Isis. Umm Sayyaf was captured during the US military raid which killed her husband in May 2015, becoming the first detainee held by the US in its year-long war against Isis. The US military transferred her over to Iraqi Kurdish custody after nearly three months of holding her in low-profile captivity for interrogation. In subsequent interviews with FBI agents, Umm Sayyaf admitted that her family had belonged to al-Qaida’s affiliate in Iraq prior to Isis’s formation, and were subsequently active members of Islamic State, the affidavit said. The woman could face life in prison if convicted. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A very bad woman named Umm Sayyaf is being accused of keeping a nice lady named Kayla Mueller as a prisoner.

Wave pools are often a major feature of water parks. Siam Park City Water Park in Thailand is home to the world's largest wave pool certified by Guinness World Records, and Siam Park (Tenerife) in Spain is home to the biggest man made waves (about 3 meters (9.8 ft)) in the world. - A museum is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance and some public museums make them available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. Most large museums are located in major cities throughout the world and more local ones exist in smaller cities, towns and even the countryside. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public. - The American Museum of Natural History (abbreviated as AMNH), located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City, is one of the largest museums in the world. Located in park-like grounds across the street from Central Park, the museum complex comprises 28 interconnected buildings housing 45 permanent exhibition halls, in addition to a planetarium and a library. The museum collections contain over 33 million specimens of plants, animals, fossils, minerals, rocks, meteorites, human remains, and human cultural artifacts, of which only a small fraction can be displayed at any given time, and occupies more than . The museum has a full-time scientific staff of 225, sponsors over 120 special field expeditions each year, and averages about five million visits annually. - The Upper West Side, sometimes abbreviated UWS, is a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan, New York City, that lies between Central Park and the Hudson River and between West 59th Street and West 110th Street. The Upper West Side is sometimes also considered by the real estate industry to include the neighborhood of Morningside Heights. - In physics, a standing wave also known as a stationary wave is a wave in a medium in which each point on the axis of the wave has an associated constant amplitude. The locations at which the amplitude is minimum are called nodes, and the locations where the amplitude is maximum are called antinodes. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans.

Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.

Christine had previously learned how to tie a necktie while helping her father get ready for formal events when she was younger. She felt confident in her ability to help Jessica master this skill on her first try. Step 1: Christine suggested that Jessica stand in front of a mirror while they practiced so she could see the process more clearly and make any needed adjustments. She also asked Jessica to grab a necktie and wear a collared shirt to get a more accurate result. Step 2: At the mirror, Christine instructed Jessica to flip up her collar and place the necktie around her neck, making sure that the wider end was on her right side and the narrow end on her left side. She explained that the wider end should be longer than the narrow end, as they would need the extra length for the knot. Step 3: Christine then guided Jessica through the process of tying a basic four-in-hand knot, which would be suitable for the wedding event. She told Jessica to cross the wide end of the tie over the narrow end, then to bring the wide end under the narrow end and pull it back up through the loop that was formed around her neck. Step 4: Next, Christine instructed Jessica to bring the wide end over the narrow end one more time, creating a second layer around the first knot. After this step, Jessica was advised to bring the wide end through the back of the loop and then carefully pass it through the newly created knot in the front. Step 5: Christine showed Jessica how to adjust and tighten the knot by pulling on the narrow end while holding the knot with her other hand. At the same time, she explained the importance of making sure the knot looked balanced and symmetrical. Step 6: Once the knot was secured, Christine helped Jessica to flip her collar back down and make any final alignment adjustments to ensure the tie was the proper length and centered on her shirt. Jessica thanked Christine for her help and felt much more confident in her ability to tie a necktie.

He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which crop would need more number of chemicals, crop A or crop B? Hint: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, crop A would need fewer chemicals compared to crop B. Crop A has been genetically engineered to be herbicide-tolerant, which allows it to grow and survive in the presence of herbicides that kill the surrounding weeds. This herbicide tolerance would not only improve weed management but also potentially reduce the number of chemicals needed during the growing season. On the other hand, crop B, which is not tolerant of herbicides, would require multiple applications of various herbicides as well as additional mechanical or hand weeding to effectively manage weeds. Consequently, crop B would require more chemicals than crop A."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

And the answer is...","completion":"Alright, let's solve the problem step by step, like we are looking for how many candies w we need to have. The equation is: -43*w - 15*w - 1422 = 21*w Step 1: Combine the w terms on the left side. So, -43 candies - 15 candies makes it -58 candies: -58*w - 1422 = 21*w Step 2: Now, let's move the 21 candies on the right side to the left side. To do this, we subtract 21 candies from both sides of the equation: -58*w - 21*w - 1422 = 0 Now we have -79 candies: -79*w - 1422 = 0 Step 3: We want to find out how many candies w we need, so let's get rid of the 1422. To do that, we add 1422 to both sides of the equation: -79*w = 1422 Step 4: Finally, we want to know the number of candies w, so we need to divide 1422 by -79: w = 1422 / -79 Now, after dividing, we find that w equals -18. So, the answer is w = -18.

Her team studied more than 350 men and women between the ages of twenty and ninety years. The study identified people in their middle twenties with memory problems. She says young adults do not know they are forgetting things because their brains have more information than they need. But she says that people in their twenties and thirties are losing memory at the same rate as people in their sixties and seventies. Ms. Park says people between the ages of sixty and seventy may note the decrease in their mental abilities. They begin to observe that they are having more trouble remembering and learning new information. The study found that older adults are more likely to remember false information as being true. For example, they remembered false medical claims as being true. Younger people remembered hearing the information. But they were more likely to remember that it was false. Ms. Park is now using modern imaging equipment to study what happens in the brains of people of different ages. She is studying what parts of the brain older adults use for different activities compared to younger adults. Ms. Park says mental performance is a direct result of brain activity and brain structure. She says keeping the brain active is important. She hopes future studies will identify ways to improve the operation of our aging minds. Question: Which of the following is a suitable title for the passage?

Please answer the following question: Information: - Costume is the distinctive style of dress of an individual or group that reflects their class, gender, profession, ethnicity, nationality, activity or epoch. - Filmmaking (or in an academic context, film production) is the process of making a film. Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through screenwriting, casting, shooting, sound recording and reproduction, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition. Filmmaking takes place in many places around the world in a range of economic, social, and political contexts, and using a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques. Typically, it involves a large number of people, and can take from a few months to several years to complete. - Epic film is a style of filmmaking with large scale, sweeping scope, and spectacle. The usage of the term has shifted over time, sometimes designating a film genre and at other times simply synonymous with big budget filmmaking. Like epics in the classical literary sense it is often focused on a heroic character. An epic's ambitious nature helps to set it apart from other types of film such as the period piece or adventure film. Epic historical films would usually take a historical or a mythic event and add an extravagant setting and lavish costumes, accompanied by an expansive musical score with an ensemble cast, which would make them among the most expensive of films to produce. The most common subjects of epic films are royalty, and important figures from various periods in world history. - An audience is a group of people who participate in a show or encounter a work of art, literature (in which they are called \\"readers\\"), theatre, music (in which they are called \\"listeners\\"), video games (in which they are called \\"players\\"), or academics in any medium. Audience members participate in different ways in different kinds of art; some events invite overt audience participation and others allowing only modest clapping and criticism and reception. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Computer animation is the process used for generating animated images. The more general term computer-generated imagery (CGI) encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images, while computer animation \\"only\\" refers to the moving images. Modern computer animation usually uses 3D computer graphics, although 2D computer graphics are still used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time renderings. Sometimes, the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes film as well. - The phi phenomenon is the optical illusion of perceiving a series of still images, when viewed in rapid succession, as continuous motion. Max Wertheimer, one of the three founders of Gestalt psychology, defined this phenomenon in 1912. The phi phenomenon and persistence of vision together formed the foundation of Hugo Münsterberg's theory of film and are part of the process of motion perception. - Grand opera is a genre of 19th-century opera generally in four or five acts, characterized by large-scale casts and orchestras, and (in their original productions) lavish and spectacular design and stage effects, normally with plots based on or around dramatic historic events. The term is particularly applied (sometimes specifically using in its French language equivalent grand opéra) to certain productions of the Paris Opéra from the late 1820s to around 1850; 'grand opéra' has sometimes been used to denote the Paris Opéra itself. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - A background actor or extra is a performer in a film , television show , stage , musical , opera or ballet production , who appears in a nonspeaking or nonsinging ( silent ) capacity , usually in the background ( for example , in an audience or busy street scene ) . War films and epic films often employ background actors in large numbers : some films have featured hundreds or even thousands of paid background actors as cast members ( hence the term ' cast of thousands ' ) . Likewise , grand opera can involve many background actors appearing in spectacular productions . On a film or TV set , background actors are usually referred to as \`\` background talent '' , \`\` background performers '' , \`\` background artists '' , \`\` background cast members '' or simply \`\` background '' while the term \`\` extra '' is rarely used . In a stage production , background actors are commonly referred to as \`\` supernumeraries '' . In opera and ballet , they are called either \`\` extras '' or \`\` supers '' . - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced. - In filmmaking, visual effects (abbreviated VFX) are the processes by which imagery is created and/or manipulated outside the context of a live action shot.

Please answer the following question: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has unveiled a far-reaching list of demands for any new nuclear deal with Iran, and threatened economy-crushing sanctions if Tehran does not change its behavior. The 12-point list of demands came in a Monday speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation that laid out the Trump administration's strategy after pulling out of the Iran nuclear agreement earlier this month. Under any new deal, Pompeo insisted, Iran must indefinitely abandon nuclear weapons work and provide United Nations inspectors access to sites anywhere in the country.He said Tehran must also end its proliferation of ballistic missiles and stop its \\"destabilizing activities\\" across the Middle East. If Iran does not change course, the U.S. \\"will apply unprecedented financial pressure,\\" Pompeo warned. \\"These will be the strongest sanctions in history by the time we are done,\\" said Pompeo. \\"The [Iranian] regime has been fighting all over the Middle East for years.

Question: - The lungs have a series of smaller and finer tubes and sacs - Air reaches the smallest and finest air sacs called alveoli - Oxygen travels from the alveoli into the blood - Oxygen-rich blood is carried to the heart - Oxygen-rich blood is pumped throughout the body by the heart - Cells take in the oxygen rich blood and release carbon dioxide rich blood - The carbon dioxide rich blood travels to the lungs - Carbon dioxide travels through the throat and is exhaled. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process is the inhalation of air through the nostrils and mouth. When we breathe in, air enters the body and is filtered, warmed, and humidified in the nasal cavity. It then passes through the pharynx (throat), which is a common passageway for both air and food, and moves into the larynx, also known as the voice box. The larynx contains the vocal cords and acts as a gatekeeper, preventing food particles from entering the respiratory system. During inhalation, the epiglottis, a flap-like structure, opens to allow air into the trachea, or windpipe. The trachea is a flexible tube that carries air from the larynx to the bronchi, the two main airways that lead to the lungs. Once inside the lungs, the bronchi branch into smaller and finer tubes called bronchioles. These bronchioles create an intricate network within the lungs, resembling a tree with multiple branches and twigs. At the end of these bronchioles, the smallest and finest air sacs, called alveoli, can be found. It is within these alveoli that the essential gas exchange between the respiratory and circulatory systems occurs. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli into the surrounding capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide, a waste product produced by our cells during various metabolic processes, diffuses from the blood in the capillaries into the alveoli. Upon receiving oxygen, the blood becomes oxygen-rich and is carried by the pulmonary veins to the heart, specifically to the left atrium. It then flows into the left ventricle and is pumped throughout the body via the aorta and other arteries. As the oxygen-rich blood reaches the body's cells, oxygen is taken in and utilized, while carbon dioxide-rich blood is released as a waste product. The carbon dioxide-rich blood then travels back to the heart, enters the right atrium, and moves into the right ventricle. From there, it is pumped through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs, where the carbon dioxide is removed from the blood and expelled from the body. This process of exhalation involves the carbon dioxide passing through the alveoli, bronchioles, bronchi, trachea, larynx, pharynx, and ultimately out through the mouth and nostrils. In summary, the first step of the respiratory process involves the inhalation of air through the mouth and nostrils, passing through various structures such as the nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi, before reaching the alveoli in the lungs for gas exchange to occur."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally.

Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. A:","completion":"Team A led a less safer experiment.

This causes the air molecules to move faster and collide with the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside the can may eventually exceed the strength of the can itself, which may result in an explosion. Additionally, as the soup begins boiling, it will produce more gas and create even more pressure within the can. On the other hand, Team B vented the can before heating it, which allowed the pressure inside the can to be released, preventing the build-up of pressure within the can and reducing the risk of an explosion. As a result, Team A conducted a less safer experiment compared to Team B."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Jed is heavyset, and Tyler is thin. During the race, who will speed up fastest? (A) Jed (B) Tyler A:","completion":"B) Tyler When comparing a heavyset individual (Jed) to a thin individual (Tyler) in a race, it's important to take several factors into consideration to determine who will speed up the fastest. These factors include muscle mass, agility, body composition, and cardiovascular fitness. Based on the given information, we can infer the following: 1. Muscle Mass: A heavyset person like Jed may have more muscle mass than a thin person like Tyler. While this could provide a greater force for propelling Jed forward, it also means that Jed's body will require more energy and effort to accelerate compared to Tyler. 2. Body Composition: A heavyset individual typically has a larger percentage of body fat compared to a thin individual. Carrying excess body fat can slow a person down, as it requires more energy to move additional weight. As a result, Tyler may be quicker to speed up due to his lighter body composition. 3. Agility: Agility refers to a person's ability to quickly change direction or speed. Generally, thinner individuals like Tyler have a greater level of agility compared to heavyset individuals. This is because they have less body mass to move around, making it easier to change direction or increase speed. 4. Cardiovascular Fitness: In order to run faster, an individual needs to have good cardiovascular fitness. Generally speaking, thin individuals are more likely to have better cardiovascular fitness compared to heavyset counterparts, simply due to the fact that they have less body mass to carry around in everyday life. This may give Tyler an edge in his ability to speed up during the race. Based on these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that Tyler, the thinner individual, would likely speed up faster than Jed, the heavyset individual. However, it's important to note that many other factors, such as training status and overall fitness level, can also play a significant role in determining individual racing performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is \\"Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What century is U.S. regulations dates from?\\"","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century\\" is an accurate and adequate response to the question \\"What century is U.S. regulations dates from?\\" However, for a more detailed and informative answer, consider the following: The regulation of hunting in the United States has a long and complex history, with its roots dating back to the 19th century. Prior to the 19th century, hunting was generally considered a common right, with few restrictions or conservation measures in place. However, as the United States underwent rapid industrialization and westward expansion, many species of wildlife faced significant declines due to habitat destruction, overhunting, and market hunting. The recognition of these issues and the desire to conserve and manage game species for present and future generations led to the creation of hunting regulations within the United States in the 19th century. The Lacey Act, passed in 1900, was the first major federal conservation law, prohibiting interstate transport of game killed in violation of state laws and protecting wildlife from market hunting and other unsustainable practices. Additionally, state-level regulations began to emerge during the latter half of the 19th century. For example, the New York State Game Law in 1873 established a first step towards the creation of a conservation agency responsible for wildlife management and enforcement of hunting and fishing regulations. States across the country implemented various forms of hunting rules and procedures, from setting seasons and licensing requirements to establishing game wardens to enforce the new laws. Furthermore, the passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918 marked the foundation of federal regulation of migratory birds, including ducks, geese, and songbirds. The act was a response to the drastic declines in bird populations caused by unregulated hunting and the millinery trade, which used bird feathers for fashion purposes. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act provided the foundation for modern-day waterfowl hunting regulations and has had a significant impact on the conservation of many migratory bird species. In conclusion, the origins of hunting regulations in the United States can be traced back to the 19th century when societal, environmental, and conservation concerns called for the implementation of laws to protect wildlife and ensure sustainable hunting practices. These early regulations set the groundwork for the more advanced, science-based wildlife management strategies that guide U.S. hunting regulations today. So, while the simple statement that hunting regulations date from the 19th century is accurate, it's important to recognize that the story is much richer and more nuanced, reflecting the evolving relationship between people and wildlife in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - Fiona Elizabeth Bruce (born 25 April 1964) is a British television journalist, newsreader and television presenter. Since joining the BBC as a researcher on Panorama in 1989, she has gone on to present many flagship programmes for the corporation including the \\"BBC News at Six\\", \\"BBC News at Ten\\", \\"Crimewatch\\", \\"Antiques Roadshow\\" and, most recently, \\"Fake or Fortune\\". - Crimewatch (formerly Crimewatch UK) is a long-running and high-profile British television programme produced by the BBC, that reconstructs major unsolved crimes in order to gain information from the public which may assist in solving the case. The programme was originally broadcast once a month on BBC One, although in more recent years it has more usually been broadcast roughly once every two months. It was announced on 15 October 2008 that the BBC would move the production of shows such as \\"Crimewatch\\" to studios in Cardiff. - A TV format is the overall concept and branding of a copyrighted television program. The most common type of formats are those in the television genres of game shows and reality shows, many of which are remade in multiple markets with local contestants. Recent examples include \\"Survivor\\", \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\", \\"Pop Idol\\" and \\"Big Brother\\" that have all proved successful worldwide. - Antiques Roadshow is a British television show in which antiques appraisers travel to various regions of the United Kingdom ( and occasionally in other countries ) to appraise antiques brought in by local people . It has been running since 1979 , based on a 1977 documentary series . The series has spawned international versions with the same TV format , including Canada and the United States . As of 2016 it is presented by Fiona Bruce and is in its 38th series . - The BBC News at Six is the evening news programme broadcast each night on British television channel BBC One and the BBC News channel at 18:00. For a long period the \\"News at Six\\" was the most watched news programme in the UK but since 2006 it has been over taken by the \\"BBC News at Ten\\". On average it pulls in 4 million viewers. - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402. - A game show is a type of radio, television, or internet programming genre in which contestants, television personalities or celebrities, sometimes as part of a team, play a game which involves answering questions or solving puzzles usually for money and/or prizes. Alternatively, a \\"gameshow\\" can be a demonstrative program about a game (while usually retaining the spirit of an awards ceremony). In the former, contestants may be invited from a pool of public applicants. On some shows, contestants compete against other players or another team, while other shows involve contestants playing alone for a reward or a high score. Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services provided by the show's sponsor prize suppliers, who in turn usually do so for the purposes of product placement. One of the reasons that television broadcasters make game shows is because they are substantially less costly than producing scripted drama shows. Some TV game shows fall under the category of reality television. - Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (sometimes informally known as Millionaire) is an international television game show franchise of British origin, created by David Briggs, Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight. In its format, currently owned and licensed by Sony Pictures Television, large cash prizes are offered for correctly answering a series of multiple-choice questions of increasing (or, in some cases, random) difficulty. The maximum cash prize (in the original British version) was one million pounds. Most international versions offer a top prize of one million units of the local currency; the actual value of the prize varies widely, depending on the value of the currency. - Pop Idol is a British television music competition created by Simon Fuller which ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003. The aim of the show was to decide the best new young pop singer (or \\"pop idol\\") in the UK based on viewer voting and participation. Two series were broadcastone in 20012002 and a second in 2003. \\"Pop Idol\\" was subsequently put on an indefinite hiatus after series judge Simon Cowell announced the launch of \\"The X Factor\\" in the UK in April 2004. - The BBC News at Ten also known as the BBC Ten O'Clock News or the Ten O'Clock News is the flagship evening news programme for British television channel BBC One and the BBC News channel. It is presented by Huw Edwards, and deputised by Fiona Bruce. It is the final comprehensive news programme of the day on BBC One.

Answer the following question: Left unfettered , Anthony Konieczka, 9 years old, would happily play his Game Boy Advance or PlayStation 2 from the minute he gets up to the moment he goes to bed, 14 bleary-eyed hours later. Anthony's box is stocked with traditional toys--board games, puzzles, art supplies--and as far as he is concerned, they are relics of Christmases past. His sister Michaely, 6 years old, still likes dressing her Barbies. But once she starts playing Game Boy, it's hard to get her away. Play patterns like this could take up another Christmas for the toy department. Through September, toy sales were down 5% compared with the first nine months of last year, according to the NDP Group. Meanwhile, the video-game industry is heading for another record year. Thanks to hot new games like Halo 2 for the Xbox, the industry is light-years ahead of the toy business when it comes out. While some new toys emerge every holiday season, toymakers are heading into this one without a monster hit . Indeed, there has not been a Furby-style frenzy in years. Of 10 toy segments only two, arts and crafts and dolls, have generated sales growth over a recent 12-month period. Some of the weakest categories like construction sets and action figures are the ones aimed at boys, who suffer the most from the video games. Analysts expect one of the top stocking stuffers this season to be not a traditional toy but the new generation of Nintendo's Game Boy, the DS, which hit stores last week. The deeper issue is that shifts in play patterns are forcing toymakers to fight for shelf space in a tightening market. Boys in particular seem to be abandoning traditional toys at earlier ages in favor of consumer electronics, video games, PC software and the Internet. The fact that kids are growing more tech-savvy , a trend called \\"age compression \\", has troubled toy companies for at least a decade. Action figures, for instance, used to be considered healthy for boys up to age 12. Now the items are mainly marketed to boys 4 to 6. A recent study found that...
