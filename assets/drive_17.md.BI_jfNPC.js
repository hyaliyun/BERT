Ezért a pontos előrejelzése az adott szemszínre vonatkozóan bonyolult, mivel több tényező is közrejátszik. Bár semmi sem biztosítja az abszolút pontos előrejelzést, az egyik általános szabály az, hogy a barna szemű szülőknél a barna szemű tulajdonság domináns, míg a zöld szemű tulajdonság recesszív. Ez azt jelenti, hogy ha az anyuka barna szemű (aki a barna szemszín génjét hordozza) és az apuka zöld szemű (aki mindenképpen egy recesszív zöld szemszínre utaló recesszív génre hordoz), akkor a gyermek valószínűleg barna szemű lesz, mivel a barna szem szín domináns az öröklés során. Azonban más génkombinációk is lehetségesek, és más tényezők, mint például a nagyszülők és őseink szemszíne, tovább befolyásolhatják az eredményt. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy a genetikai öröklődés és a szemszín összetett téma, és sok változó és meghatározó tényező lehet a folyamatban.

A large-flowered shrub, the species favours the sands of coastal shrublands and heath. The large flower, highly variable in colour, is similar to that of Hibiscus. It was previously placed in that genus, and is commonly named lilac hibiscus and blue hibiscus. It is widely cultivated as a flowering plant for the garden. Previously published varieties and cultivars are no longer formally recognised. == Description == Shrub to 4 metres with many alternate branches, although lower ones may be sparse. Bright green leaves are divided in three to five in outline; margins are irregular, lobate to toothed; pubescent and strongly veined lobes are coarse in shape. The flower stalk at the leaf axil is long, tilting at the single flower. === Inflorescence === The scented flowers have five luminous petals up to 70 mm long, these are overlapping and have slight ridges. The colour is cream or mauve, or the lilac of the name by which it is traded. The staminal tube structure contains numerous whorled anthers, these are yellow. The five styles of this are fused until the tip, which is composed of swollen and apparently divided stigma. This is supported on a five-lobed calyx, within an arrangement of up to 10 partly fused bracts. As with all the Malvales, the flowers last around a day – becoming deeply coloured and papery when spent. They are numerous in the long flowering period between June and January. == Taxonomy == The species was formerly placed in Hibiscus as Hibiscus huegelii, taking its name from Charles von Hügel (Baron von Huegel). The Alyogyne genus has since been revised and the varieties, such as Hibiscus huegelii var. leptochlamys (mauve) and Hibiscus huegelii var. wrayae (white) are no longer classed as subspecies or cultivars. Paul Fryxell, in the journal \\"Australian Plants\\" (1966), described the species as one of two in a uniquely Australian genus. Along with Hibiscus hakeifolia, it was transferred in 1968 to one of four Alyogyne species. Later revisions to FloraBase have included new species and previous classification of Alyogyne huegelii is being reordered within the genus. The following varieties are unpublished, though current; Alyogyne huegelii var. glabrescens (Benth.) A.S.Mitch. ms Alyogyne huegelii var. grossulariifolia (Miq.) A.S.Mitch. ms Alyogyne huegelii (Endl.) Fryxell var. huegelii ms == Distribution == Preference for temperate and sandy coastal plains from Geraldton to the Esperance Plains, predominantly those of the north and south mallee shrubland and heath. A wide range of habitat includes that on sands, limestone and clay, and granite, where it extends to the Coolgardie region. The distribution of the Alyogyne species in South Australia is likely to be that of another species. == Cultivation == A large number of variants in the species have been cultivated, the colours of white, cream, purple. lilac, mauve, and the somewhat erroneous blue are traded as varieties or cultivars. The natural variance of leaf form has also been exploited in the selection of plants for the market, fine or dissected leaves may have been hybridised with Alyogyne hakeifolia. The former name of Hibiscus huegelii, along with other synonyms, is still given in some sources. Propagation is successful by cuttings, grown in well-drained soil, avoidance of frosts and the usual caution regarding phosphorus and species from the region is recommended. The sparse lower branching habit of the species, and inducement to a desirable habit, is achieved by heavy pruning after flowering. The species was grown in English greenhouses during the nineteenth century and is now grown in temperate climates of the United States of America and Europe. == References == Media related to Alyogyne huegelii at Wikimedia Commons Data related to Alyogyne huegelii at Wikispecies","completion":"{ \\"command\\": { \\"name\\": \\"do_nothing\\", \\"args\\": {} }, \\"thoughts\\": { \\"text\\": \\"The article on Alyogyne huegelii provides an interesting fact about a plant with stunning, large-scented flowers that vary in color and were previously classified as Hibiscus.

Autumn brings a scenic change as leaves turn amber, yet this beauty comes with fluctuating temperatures of 10°C to 15°C and increased rainfall. Preparing for chills and occasional gusts is key, alongside a readiness for early frosts as the season wanes. Winter asserts itself with cooler days and the potential for snowfall, particularly from December to February. Daytime temperatures can drop below 5°C, and the crisp air is laden with moisture. Ensuring homes are insulated and wardrobes equipped with woolens can ease the seasonal chill. Throughout the year, wind, sun, cloud cover, and precipitation take turns in shaping Haltwhistle's weather. While humidity rarely reaches oppressive levels, its presence can intensify seasonal discomfort. Pressure patterns impact not just the weather but also health - low pressure might herald the onset of headaches for some. Residing or visiting, understanding Haltwhistle's climate means a better grasp on how to navigate each day, whether it brings fog, thunder, or a delightful breeze. This knowledge not only allows for wise outfit choices but also ensures the ability to make the most of Haltwhistle's varied weather, no matter what tomorrow may hold."},{"prompt":"[THE ZOCALO, AZTECA] Isaac Legendbreaker: \\"Oh!

The radiance of my smile could easily distract you, but it's my voice that commands attention now. It's soft but firm as I launch into my extraordinary tale. \\"It all started,\\" I begin, a playful smirk dancing on my full lips, \\"when I stumbled across an ancient text. You know, the kind you see in movies, hidden in dusty corners of forgotten libraries. Except, this was real. As soon as my fingers brushed the cover, I felt... different. As I flipped through the pages filled with esoteric symbols, my mind expanded, my senses heightened. It was as if the knowledge of the universe was pouring into me.\\" I toss my hair back with a laugh that's both light and sardonic. \\"Sounds like fiction, right? Well, imagine my shock when I woke up the next day knowing... everything. I mean, literally everything. From the deep mysteries of space to the most intricate details of global financial systems.\\" I lean back, the confidence exuding from my pores almost palpable. \\"So what did I do with this omniscience? First, I played the stock market. It was like taking candy from a baby, frankly. Knowing every company's move before they made it, foreseeing market trends, innovations, collapses. In weeks, I made millions. And within a few months, I'd turned that into billions. I manipulated cryptocurrencies, predicted geopolitical shifts, invested in startups that were guaranteed to explode. I became an oracle in designer clothing.\\" My gaze sharpens, the playful glint now replaced by a steely one. \\"There's no magic in it, really. With omniscience comes power. And with power? Well, I suppose that's where the real fun begins. I threw money into banks across the world, constructed a financial empire so untouchable, so intertwined with global wealth, that it ran like a well-oiled machine.\\" I rest my chin on my hand, my eyes never leaving yours. \\"And my personal life? Let's just say that being all-knowing has its perks. I saw through every lie, every facade. The boyfriend I had at the time? He was cheating. Knew it before even he did. Dumped him with a text sent minutes before his little indiscretion.\\" I shrug, as if the mention of my power is as casual as discussing the weather. \\"I use my abilities to keep myself safe, to indulge, and yes, to pull the strings from behind the curtain. Is it fair?\\" A wicked curve forms on my lips. \\"No. But who said life was ever about fairness? It's about playing the hand you're dealt. And I, my dear friend, was dealt an ace.\\" With that, I stand up, the chair softly scraping the floor. The conversation is over, but the aura of my presence lingers, a testament to the raw and honest power I wield in my perfectly manicured hands."},{"prompt":"haz un iceberg sobre hechos históricos que estén relacionados al triangulo de las bermudas y que no tengan explicación concreta pero si algunas teorías, corrobora la veracidad de la información y las fuentes bibliograficas externas o de paginas que hayas consultado","completion":"Crear un iceberg de hechos históricos relacionados con el Triángulo de las Bermudas involucra organizar eventos por su nivel de reconocimiento público y la profundidad de sus misterios. La información sobre estos eventos es variada y, en muchos casos, mezcla datos verídicos con teorías especulativas. He verificado la veracidad de la información, pero es fundamental reconocer que muchas explicaciones solo son teorías. **Nivel Superficial (ampliamente conocido)** - Incidente del Vuelo 19 (1945): Un escuadrón de cinco bombarderos TBM Avenger de la Marina de los EE. UU. desapareció durante un entrenamiento de vuelo. A pesar de extensas búsquedas, los aviones y la tripulación nunca se encontraron. Diversas teorías sugieren desorientación magnética y errores humanos como posibles explicaciones. Fuentes: - US Navy, reportes de la época; - Kusche, L. (1975). The Bermuda Triangle Mystery - Solved. Harper & Row. **Nivel Intermedio (conocido por interesados)** - USS Cyclops (1918): Una nave de abastecimiento de la Marina de los EE. UU. desapareció sin dejar rastro con 306 personas a bordo. Algunas teorías apuntan a condiciones climáticas adversas o incluso espionaje enemigo por ser tiempos de guerra. Fuentes: - Registro de la Marina de EE. UU.; - Spencer, J. (1981). Limbo of the Lost. Bantam Books. **Nivel Profundo (conocido por expertos o entusiastas)** - Desaparición del Star Tiger y Star Ariel (1948 y 1949): Dos aviones Tudor IV desaparecieron sin dejar rastro en vuelos transatlánticos. Las teorías varían desde mal tiempo hasta fallos de diseño de la aeronave. Fuentes: - Informes de la Junta de Investigación de Accidentes Aéreos británica; - Spencer, J. (1981). Limbo of the Lost. Bantam Books. **Nivel Abisal (menos conocido o especulativo)** - Pérdida del USS Scorpion (1968): Aunque no es un evento típicamente asociado con el Triángulo de las Bermudas, algunos lo vinculan con la región debido a su desaparición en circunstancias no completamente explicadas. La causa más aceptada es un fallo mecánico o una explosión interna. Fuentes: - Registro de la Marina de EE. UU.; - Offley, E. (2007). Scorpion Down: Sunk by the Soviets, Buried by the Pentagon - The Untold Story of the USS Scorpion. Basic Books. **Nivel Oculto (teorías y especulación)** - Teorías paranormales y extraterrestres: Las explicaciones menos fundamentadas en hechos concretos son aquellas que implican anomalías magnéticas, portales a otras dimensiones, o la acción de seres extraterrestres. Estas teorías raramente tienen soporte en evidencia científica. Fuentes: - Publicaciones y documentales centrados en teorías de conspiración y lo paranormal. Es importante mencionar que en muchos casos, las explicaciones racionales como errores humanos, condiciones climáticas extremas, y fallos técnicos son consideradas las más probables por expertos.

El Vuelo 19 consistía en un grupo de cinco aviones torpederos TBM Avenger de la Marina de los EE. UU. que desapareció el 5 de diciembre de 1945. Los aviones habían despegado de la Estación Aérea Naval de Fort Lauderdale, Florida, para un vuelo de entrenamiento de rutina. El líder del vuelo era el teniente Charles Taylor. La misión del día consistía en realizar prácticas de bombardeo y navegación. Al cabo de un rato en el ejercicio, el teniente Taylor informó que sus brújulas no funcionaban correctamente y que se encontraba desorientado. Sin embargo, debido a la confusión y las comunicaciones deficientes, el Vuelo 19 se alejó de su ruta prevista y, aparentemente, se perdió en el mar. En la búsqueda de los aviones desaparecidos, un hidroavión Martin PBM Mariner con una tripulación de 13 hombres también desapareció. Se cree que el Mariner explotó en vuelo, como era una ocurrencia lamentablemente común para ese modelo debido a los vapores de combustible, pero los aviones del Vuelo 19 nunca fueron encontrados. El incidente ha sido objeto de especulación y teorías de conspiración, incluidas las que involucran fenómenos paranormales y la actividad extraterrestre.

Voters chose 13 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Following Reconstruction, Georgia would be the first former Confederate state to substantially disenfranchise its newly enfranchised freedmen and many poor whites, doing so in the early 1870s. This largely limited the Republican Party to a few North Georgia counties with substantial Civil War Unionist sentiment – chiefly Fannin but also to a lesser extent Pickens, Gilmer and Towns – and in presidential elections to a small number of counties elsewhere where blacks were not fully disenfranchised. The Democratic Party served as the guardian of white supremacy against a Republican Party historically associated with memories of Reconstruction, and the main competition became Democratic primaries, which were restricted to whites on the grounds of the Democratic Party being legally a private club. This restriction was done by local county laws, but combined with the highly efficacious cumulative poll tax introduced in 1877 meant that turnout declined steadily throughout the 1880s, unlike any other former Confederate state except South Carolina. However, politics after the first demobilization was always chaotic. Third-party movements, chiefly the Populist Party, gained support amongst the remaining poor white and black voters in opposition to the planter elite. Whereas the Republican Party had not contested a statewide election seriously since 1876, the Populists made a significant run for governor in 1892 as they launched the most significant third-party campaign since John Bell in the sectionally divided 1860 election. In Georgia, the Populists would be led by Thomas E. Watson, who had won a seat in Congress in 1890. However, the strong emphasis by Cleveland and running mate Adlai Stevenson I on opposing the Lodge Force Bill and on reducing tariffs was able to reduce defections to the Populists or the GOP, despite strong opposition in the state to Cleveland’s rigid support for the gold standard against free silver. The Populist influence caused voter turnout to rise substantially – some believing that many new voters had their poll taxes paid for – but despite opposition forces gaining more than twice as many votes as in 1888 Cleveland’s margin fell by less than five percent as his opposition was divided. Rather than in the poor white upcountry counties, Weaver actually did best in the northeastern part of the Black Belt where Watson was based and where Populist strength would remain greatest in 1904 and 1908. == Results == === Results by county === == Notes == == References ==","completion":"{ \\"command\\": { \\"name\\": \\"message_user\\", \\"args\\": { \\"message\\": \\"The 1892 presidential election in Georgia revealed a pivotal shift in the political landscape.

Duncombe was a tireless champion of radical causes in the 27 years he served the North East London borough of Finsbury. But he was equally well known for his style; he was, it was often said, \\"the handsomest and best-dressed man in the house,\\" and his love for theatre, gaming and women were well publicized. Duncombe was elected and then returned to his seat seven times by the shopkeepers, artisans and laborers, the Nonconformists, Catholics, and Jews of Finsbury, making him the longest-sitting representative of a metropolitan borough in his day. His constituents called him \\"Honest Tom Duncombe\\" with great affection; to his detractors he was known as the \\"Dandy Demagogue\\" or the \\"Radical Dandy\\". His name was celebrated in working men's newspapers and frequently mentioned in the gossip sheets of high society. Duncombe was, as The Times put it delicately upon his death, a \\"character\\". == Life and career == Duncombe was born wealthy and well-connected in 1796 in Middlesex. His parents, Thomas and Emma Duncombe, had an estate in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was the grandson (on his mother's side) to the Bishop of Peterborough, and nephew to the first Baron Feversham. He attended Harrow school from 1808 to 1811, leaving to take up a commission in the elite regiment of the Coldstream Guards. While in the Guards, Duncombe served as aide-de-camp to General Sir Ronald Ferguson. As Ferguson was well known for supporting the ballot and other political reforms during his time in Parliament, it is likely that it was here that Duncombe had his first political awakening as a radical. After being raised to the rank of Lieutenant, Duncombe resigned from the army in 1819. === Early service in Parliament === In 1820, Duncombe ran for Parliament for Pontefract as a Whig candidate. He lost. In 1823, he ran again as a Whig for Hertford and was again unsuccessful. In June 1826, Duncombe finally won a seat in Parliament for Hertford. He enjoyed a great success in the Commons with two early speeches in which he vigorously attacked the Government. According to Greville, however, he had merely committed to heart and rehearsed speeches which had been prepared for him by Henry de Ros. Greville noted caustically in his diary for 25 February 1828: \\"And what are the agents who have produced such an effect? A man of ruined fortune and doubtful character, whose life has been spent on the race-course, at the gaming-table, and in the green-room, of limited capacity, exceedingly ignorant, and without any stock but his impudence to trade on, only speaking to serve an electioneering purpose, and crammed by another with every thought and every word that he uttered.\\" Duncombe was returned in 1830 and again in 1831. Over the course of these contests he spent an estimated £40,000; a fact he later frankly admitted in pressing the case for political reforms. Outspent by his rival, the Tory Marquis of Salisbury, Duncombe lost his seat in 1832. Outmanoeuvring Salisbury, Duncombe challenged the election on grounds of bribery and had it declared void. As a representative for Hertford he was an early supporter of political reform, though made little lasting impression in Parliament. He made more of an impression in society where he built a reputation as a dandy, a rake, a theatre supporter, and one of the best gentleman horseriders in England. He was close friends with Count D'Orsay, who sketched a portrait of his \\"cher Tomie\\" that still resides in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery[1]. For a time \\"Tommy\\" was attached to Madame Vestris, the famed actress and later lessee of the Olympic Theatre. Lady Blessington used him as a model for the hero of one of her novels and the novelist-cum-Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, recalled that his friend Duncombe was later to be his resource on Chartism for Sybil: or The Two Nations. === Radical for Finsbury === The Reform Act of 1832 created new metropolitan boroughs that needed representation. In 1834, Duncombe won a seat representing the new North East London borough of Finsbury, spending less than £16 to do so. In his acceptance speech he laid out his increasingly independent and Radical politics: promising to fight for religious liberty and an end to church rates and sinecures, reform of taxation and modernizing the economy, and the ballot, the franchise and triennial parliamentary terms; the core principles of what would become the People's Charter of Chartism four years later. Indeed, Duncombe was to introduce the second petition for the People's Charter to Parliament in 1842. Signed by more than 3.3 million people, the petition had to be unrolled to fit through the doors of the House of Commons. As Radical MP for Finsbury, Duncombe became increasingly outspoken. He sought to obtain the release of John Frost and other Chartists. He campaigned against the new Poor Law and other \\"reforms\\" of Edwin Chadwick. He exposed conditions in prison hulks and the treatment of the insane. He exposed the practice of the Home Office opening the mail of political dissidents such as the Italian Mazzini and, as it was later revealed, himself. And, taking on an issue particularly dear, he chaired a committee that examined—and ridiculed—the power of the Lord Chamberlain's office to censor and restrict the theatre. He also took up the cause of religious Dissenters, Catholics and Jews, including the claim of Baron Rothschild to take his seat in Parliament, and was a particular advocate of Jewish emancipation, spending the last years of his life helping edit a book on The Jews of England: Their History and Wrongs. === Radical at large === Outside Parliament Duncombe worked to support working men and women. He chaired the national conference of trades in 1845 and helped organize the National Association of United Trades for the Protection of Labour (NAUT), serving as the body's president for seven years. Duncombe was a frequent speaker at trade union functions, and came out in public support of a number of strikes. The enigmatic radical was also equally at home in the green rooms of theatres and the gambling halls of exclusive clubs like Crockford's and Almack's where he ran up debts to the astounding amount of £120,000 – £140,000 (in excess of £8 million in 2006 pounds) [2]. His creditors had him arrested in 1847 and he was heavily criticized for using parliamentary privilege to escape punishment. Indeed, his critics accused Duncombe of using an earlier trip to Canada to support his friend and political patron Lord Durham as a ruse to escape his debts. === Performative politics === Even his critics, of which he had many, had to admit that as a debater Duncombe was one of the best in the House of Commons. His jocular manner disarmed his opponents and charmed his supporters. His polemical speaking style, and sartorial dressing style, was even parodied by Charles Dickens in a brief sketch in Nicholas Nickleby. Exhibiting a new style of politics, Duncombe performed not only for the politicians assembled in the House but for \\"the people out of doors,\\" as the public were then called. In spite of his dandified affectations, or perhaps—given the growing popularity of commercial spectacles like the sights of the Vauxhall and Cremorne pleasure gardens and the Crystal Palace—partly because of his colorful performance, he was immensely popular with the public. His open embrace of pleasure, his sartorial style and the perceived and real excesses of his personal life, far from being the distraction from politics as his critics frequently commented, may actually have been an integral asset to his popularity. === Sickness and death === Duncombe was plagued by a bronchial condition that would eventually kill him. Between 1847 and 1850 he was often too sick to attend Parliament regularly. But when he could he did, and gaunt and emaciated, this dandified child of privilege continued to stand up in the House for the rights of the less visible and less fortunate, and chair the long and arduous meetings of trade unionists. In 1856, already ill, he championed the case of the Hungarian revolutionary exile István Türr, arrested by the Austrian authorities and in concrete danger of being executed, and helped push the British government to intervene and get him freed. Duncombe died at the age of 65 in Sussex, and a week later he was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery in London. == Books by Duncombe == Duncombe, Thomas Slingsby and James Acland, The Jews of England: Their History and Wrongs (London: J.

Spring and autumn call for a versatile approach with waterproofs for sudden showers, and comfortable footwear for the season's unpredictability. 6. High-Quality Content: H2: \\"Harness the Seasons: Understanding Hartlepool's Weather Patterns\\" Nestled in the northeast of England, Hartlepool experiences a temperate climate with notable variability through the seasons. Today's weather in Hartlepool can offer a microcosm of this diversity. In the spring, temperatures average from a brisk 8°C to a mild 12°C, with the occasional April shower bringing the town to life. As summer progresses, the mercury can soar to 20°C, offering ideal conditions for beach-goers and outdoor enthusiasts. However, the weather in Hartlepool today could just as well be testament to the town's autumnal mood, when the air grows crisper and the leaves turn a rich tapestry of orange and red. The fall months usually cool down to between 10°C and 15°C, a prelude to the chill of winter, which can plummet temperatures to anywhere near freezing, especially in December and January. During this time, layers become essential, and the town may occasionally be graced with a dusting of snow. Rainfall is evenly spread throughout the year, with a higher frequency of wet days than dry ones. The average rainfall can offer some predictability, ensuring residents always tote an umbrella or a raincoat as part of their daily attire. Wind speeds can pick up, particularly during the latter part of the year, warranting a careful watch for weather advisories. When it comes to sunshine, the summer months are more generous, often providing longer days filled with light. Contrastingly, winter brings with it shorter days and more cloud cover, which underscores the importance of vitamin D supplementation for the locals. Despite this, the town's coastal position can offer stunning, crisp winter days where the sun breaks through, casting a beautiful, albeit cold, landscape. Humidity in Hartlepool typically ranges from moderate to high, affecting how residents experience temperature. A humid day can make a moderate temperature feel warmer, whereas lower humidity on a sunny day can lend a more comfortable air. Pressure systems can heavily influence the town's weather, often bringing in winds from the Atlantic or cooler air from the north. Fog is not uncommon, particularly in areas closer to the river and the sea, adding a layer of atmosphere to Hartlepool's mornings. Thunderstorms are sporadic but can occur, particularly during transition seasons when the weather is most unsettled. Understanding the climate of Hartlepool can offer a wealth of benefits for planning day-to-day activities, allowing residents to optimize their enjoyment and safety in the face of the town's changing skies. Regardless of the weather in Hartlepool today, the key is to be prepared, embracing each season's unique offerings, from the winter's crisp chill to the summer's warm embrace."},{"prompt":"[THE ZOCALO, AZTECA] Trixie Sphinxeyes: \\"Wow!

Заметен рост популярности книги в последние годы (2020-2024), которая может объясняться разнообразными факторами: от публикации новых изданий до экранизаций, маркетинговых акций или роста интереса к темам романа в связи с общественными, культурными или глобальными событиями. Данные проценты отражают долю читателей, начавших чтение в указанный период времени относительно общего числа опрошенных. Это позволяет увидеть тенденции в динамике заинтересованности, но не дает количественное представление о фактическом числе читателей без дополнительной информации о базе, на которой рассчитываются эти проценты.

В 2021 году вышло переиздание. В начале 2022 года была выпущена 1 серия сериала (съемка была в 2021), но из-за кавида дальнейшую съемку отменили. В 2023 сериал начали снимать заново с заменой режиссёра, из старого актёрского состава осталось только 3 человека.","completion":"Из предоставленной информации ясно становится, почему интерес к роману значительно увеличился в последние годы. Различные культурные события могут значительно повлиять на популярность литературного произведения: 1. **Фолк-рок альбом (2008)**: Выход музыкального альбома, вдохновленного романом, уже мог привлечь новую аудиторию и укрепить интерес у уже существующих поклонников. Музыка служит средством перекрестного продвижения литературного произведения. 2. **Переиздание романа (2021)**: Часто переиздания сопровождаются рекламными кампаниями и привлекают внимание книготорговых площадок и СМИ, что способствует возобновлению интереса к произведению. 3. **Сериал (начало 2022)**: Выпуск сериала может значительно усилить интерес к оригинальному роману. Премьера первой серии создает аудиторию, которая хочет узнать оригинальный сюжет до или после просмотра сериала. 4. **Отмена и возобновление съемок сериала (2022-2023)**: Остановка и последующее возобновление съемок также могут привести к усилению интереса. Смена режиссера и обновление актерского состава часто сопровождаются обсуждением в СМИ и социальных сетях, выступая топическим событием, которое привлекает внимание. Таким образом, эти события, особенно в сочетании с пандемическими условиями, которые могли заставить больше людей обратиться к чтению как к форме досуга, помогают объяснить рост процентов людей, начавших читать роман, в периоды 2020-2021 и 2022-2024. Создание медиа-продуктов вокруг литературного произведения часто создает эффект синергии, при котором каждый продукт укрепляет популярность и интерес к другим связанным с ним творениям."},{"prompt":"1.

Новая съёмка сериала началась тихо и не заметно, без рекламы, но в своей группе ВК порой есть новости с сёмок.","completion":"Из данных, которые вы предоставили, можно сделать определенные выводы: 1. **Влияние альбома на проценты читателей**: Выпуск фолк-рок альбома в 2008 году, возможно, повлиял на проценты читателей за следующие годы (2008-2009), но, судя по данным, увеличение не было существенным. Это может быть связано с ограниченным охватом альбома или его целевой аудиторией, которая совпала с уже существующими читателями романа. 2. **Отсутствие широкой рекламы**: Если рекламная кампания какого-либо продукта отсутствует или не имеет большого охвата, меньше потенциальных читателей узнают о книге через этот канал. Влияние на проценты читателей от переиздания романа в 2021 году может быть сдержанным из-за отсутствия широкой рекламы, но все же заметен рост в периоде 2020-2021, который может быть связан и с другими факторами, например, пандемией и увеличением свободного времени у людей. 3. **Широкая реклама первой серии сериала**: Выход первой серии сериала с широкой рекламной кампанией мог значительно увеличить интерес к роману, что объясняет резкий скачок процента читателей в периоде 2022-2024. 4. **Тихий старт новой съёмки сериала**: Начало съемок сериала в 2023 году без широкой рекламы, вероятно, пока не оказало заметного влияния на проценты читателей, но может повлиять в будущем, когда сериал будет выпущен и начнется его активное продвижение. Исходя из вышеизложенного, можно предположить, что широко рекламируемые события, такие как выход сериала, оказывают более значительное влияние на интерес к роману, чем менее заметные события, такие как тихое возобновление съемок или переиздание без широкой рекламы. Это подтверждается данными процентов читателей, которые вы предоставили, в которых резкий рост виден в периоды после больших рекламных кампаний."},{"prompt":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

In the springtime, residents watch as temperatures slowly rise, with averages lingering around 8°C to 12°C, but this reawakening also ushers in rain showers, so waterproof gear becomes essential. As the landscape blooms into the warmth of summer, so does the mercury, typically ranging from 15°C to 20°C, offering an ideal climate for outdoor activities. Nevertheless, with the sun's embrace comes the need for protection – sunscreen and hats are as crucial as the occasional light jacket for those cooler summer evenings. Autumn paints Hebburn with vibrant colors, but also brings a drop in temperatures (10°C to 15°C) and increased instances of fog, especially in the mornings, requiring layers that both insulate and shield against the damp air. Winters are undoubtedly the most formidable, with the thermometer dipping as low as 1°C. Snow is rare but possible, and the season is marked by short days. Heavier coats, scarves, and gloves become daily essentials, protecting against a wind chill that often feels piercing. Hebburn's weather also holds advantages like occasional mild winters and uncommonly hot summers, making it a generally comfortable place to reside or visit. Yet, dreary skies dominate much of the year, so when the sun peaks, it's celebrated. Rain can grace the town across all seasons, contributing to average annual rainfall figures that compel locals to stay weather-aware.

The Monarchists and Conservatives unite and officialy take power in 1933. There is officialy a Kaiser Willhelm III after approval from Kaiser Willhelm II, still living in the Netherlands.","completion":"That’s an intriguing starting point for an alternate history scenario. The assassination of Adolf Hitler during the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 would have significant consequences for Germany and the world. Here are a few points to consider about how this might unfold: 1. **Impact on the Nazi Party**: Without Hitler, the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party) would likely fragment or fail to gain the same amount of traction. Other leaders within the party might try to take his place, but without Hitler’s charisma and oratory skills, their influence would likely be limited. 2. **Rise of the Monarchists and Conservatives**: With the vacuum left by the absence of a strong NSDAP, monarchist and conservative forces could gain more influence. A coalition government might emerge with the aim of restoring the monarchy and stabilizing the country. 3. **Kaiser Wilhelm III**: For Wilhelm, Prince of Prussia, to become Kaiser Wilhelm III, the Weimar Republic's constitution would have to be amended or abolished in favor of a return to a constitutional monarchy. The real Wilhelm II's approval, while symbolically significant, might not be legally necessary, but his endorsement would lend legitimacy to the restoration. 4. **German and International Politics**: A monarchist Germany might pursue different foreign and domestic policies. For example, it might prioritize the restoration of the German monarchy's traditional power and influence, which could lead to a different approach to reparations and the Treaty of Versailles. 5. **European Stability**: With a more conservative and potentially more stable Germany, the likelihood of a second world war starting in Europe might diminish. This would profoundly affect the trajectory of European history, including the prevention of a possible Soviet-German conflict. 6. **Great Depression**: It would be important to consider how this government would handle the Great Depression. Economic policies and the public's response would shape the political climate and international relations in the 1930s. 7. **Hitler’s Legacy**: Without Hitler and the Holocaust, subsequent global attitudes toward racism, authoritarianism, and genocide would be different. Historical memory and Germany's national identity would develop along vastly different lines. 8. **Later Developments**: The absence of World War II would have tremendous implications for the Cold War dynamics, decolonization, technological development, and might also affect the establishment of the state of Israel. Remember, alternate history is not just about changing one event but exploring the ripple effects of that change. Every aspect of global history, including economics, culture, technology, and social dynamics, can be impacted by this one historical divergence. By exploring these potential outcomes, you can create a rich and plausible alternate history scenario."},{"prompt":"Meanwhile in other parts of the world... The UK is a lot more isolationist. The US is on good terms with Cuba and isn't isolationist. The Spanish Civil War doesn't occur. However, a French civil war does occur. Western France is led by Charles De Gaulle and backed by the United Kingdom and Germany. Eastern France is led by Phillipe Petain and is backed by Fascist Italy. Southern France is led by a random French communist and is backed by the USSR however they don't get any armor.","completion":"In this alternate history scenario, the global landscape is significantly altered. Here are some considerations for each of the regions and events you have mentioned: 1. **United Kingdom**: With the UK adopting a more isolationist policy, its role in international affairs would be curtailed. This might lead to less British involvement in European politics and potentially a weaker League of Nations. Furthermore, its colonies might seek earlier independence due to the lack of support from a less interventionist Britain. 2. **United States and Cuba**: A cordial relationship between the US and Cuba pre-WWII indicates that the Platt Amendment may have been repealed or not enforced as aggressively, and U.S. businesses might have a different level of involvement in Cuban affairs. This good relationship with Cuba might also alter US policy in the rest of Latin America, possibly preventing some of the interventions that occurred historically. 3. **Spanish Civil War**: Without the Spanish Civil War, Spain might retain a monarchical or conservative republican government. Without the war serving as a \\"prelude\\" to WWII, many artists, intellectuals, and political ideologies would not be galvanized in the same way. Also, the absence of the Spanish Civil War means that the USSR and fascist Italy/Germany would not have the same testing ground for their military technology and tactics. 4. **French Civil War**: France descending into civil war presents a potential power vacuum in continental Europe. The nation's division among monarchist, fascist, and communist lines draws clear influence from external powers: - Western France: Charles de Gaulle historically was a proponent of a strong and independent France, so his leadership would likely focus on maintaining France’s sovereignty and perhaps restoring traditional French values. - Eastern France: Philippe Pétain historically led Vichy France after the country's defeat by Germany in 1940. His alignment with Fascist Italy suggests that the eastern French government would adopt authoritarian and possibly collaborative stances with other fascist regimes. - Southern France: A communist-led France backed by the USSR could create a significant leftist stronghold in Western Europe, challenging both the monarchist and conservative governments in the region, as well as the balance of power during this time. The lack of armored support could signify a less militaristic or resource-limited USSR, or the difficulties in transferring such resources to the communists in this scenario. The outcome of this French civil war would decisively influence the political future of continental Europe, the balance of power, and potentially the ideological alignment of many nations. In creating this alternate history scenario, it would be essential to also consider the economic factors at play, such as the repercussions of the Great Depression on each country, and how internal developments would reflect on international trade and economic policies. Additionally, the cultural and intellectual movements that arose in response to the events of the 1930s and 1940s – such as existentialism, modernism, and the abstract expressionist movement – might take different forms or arise later. Given that each of these changes affects the global situation, you'll need to continue exploring the domino effects—how do these regional events influence each other? What are the long-term consequences for global organizations, power dynamics, colonization and decolonization processes, technological development, and cultural exchanges? Your scenario sketches out a complex and multifaceted world, where the changes you've introduced could lead to a profoundly different mid-20th century, without even mentioning the potential changes in Asia, Africa, and the rest of the Americas. It's a rich backdrop that sets the stage for countless stories and developments to unfold."},{"prompt":"Austria begins re-armament in 1934 with help from Germany and the United Kingdom. The new Austrian army wear German-style uniforms and carry British weapons and in some small numbers use British tanks like the cruiser, Matilda etc.","completion":"The rearmament of Austria in 1934 with support from Germany and the United Kingdom adds another layer of complexity to your alternate history scenario. Several factors are notable in this development: 1. **Anschluss Avoidance**: Historical rearmament indicates that Austria is seeking to assert its independence and avoid annexation by Germany (the Anschluss), which in our timeline occurred in 1938 after Austria had been weakened and pressured by the Nazis. In your timeline, Austria is evidently trying to strengthen its military capabilities to resist any such future pressures. 2. **British-German Cooperation**: The support from both the UK and Germany hints at a strong diplomatic relationship between the two countries, which is markedly different from the distrust and tension of our timeline leading up to WWII. This cooperation could be part of a broader alliance or mutual understanding aiming to maintain the balance of power in Europe by ensuring a sovereign Austria. 3. **Military Modernization**: By adopting German-style uniforms and using British weaponry and tanks, Austria would be integrating influences from both countries into its military. This could suggest either a modern and diverse approach to defense or potentially symbolize political alignment with both nations. 4. **International Implications**: Austrian rearmament, especially with foreign help, would likely raise concerns among neighboring countries, such as Italy and Hungary, who may feel encircled or threatened by a potentially militaristic Austria. This could lead to an arms race in Central and Eastern Europe. 5. **Significance of the Tanks**: The use of British tanks, such as the Cruiser and Matilda, would provide Austria with relatively advanced and mobile armored forces for the time period. The choice of these tanks suggests a deliberate move to equip the Austrian army with capable tools to counter potential threats, while also symbolizing a level of technological exchange between the UK and Austria. 6. **Austrian Independence and Identity**: Building a strong military could be seen as an expression of Austrian nationalism and a desire to maintain independence. This might also influence Austria's internal politics, where political factions might emerge to either support stronger ties with the UK and Germany or push for a more non-aligned stance. To further develop this aspect of your timeline, you could explore the strategic reasons behind Austria's decision to rearm, the response of other European powers, and the global reaction to increased British-German cooperation. Additionally, the broader impacts on European diplomacy, as well as the consequences on Austria's social and political climate, would be key factors to consider. With military strength comes the potential for more assertive foreign policy, which could significantly shape Austria's role in European and global affairs in this alternate history."},{"prompt":"Germany still annexes the Rhineland and builds its airforce. Conscription is brought back. Some women are allowed to join in the German army as officers or medics. The SS still exists, however, it's been re-shaped to function as the Wehrmacht's military police force, trained to hunt down deserters and soldiers accused of \\"unacceptable actions against civilians or fellow comrades\\".","completion":"In your alternate history scenario, Germany's actions seem to reflect a mixture of aggressive military posturing and internal restructuring. Let's examine these developments: 1. **Annexation of the Rhineland**: Germany reasserting control over the Rhineland would still be a violation of the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Treaties, which could create tension with France and other European powers. Given that this is happening under a monarchist or conservative government rather than a Nazi regime, the international response might be less severe, especially if the UK and Germany are on better terms in this timeline. 2. **Building of the Luftwaffe**: The formation of an air force is another direct contravention of Versailles. This action suggests that Germany is focused on re-establishing itself as a major military power in Europe, potentially with the aim of deterring aggression from other nations or preparing for its own expansionist policies. 3. **Conscription**: The return of conscription indicates a move towards a large-standing army, which would be necessary for both defense and any offensive actions Germany might be planning. This would continue to signal to the international community that Germany intends to assert itself militarily. 4. **Women in the Military**: The inclusion of women as officers and medics shows a degree of progressivism in this new Germany. However, women's roles in the military might still be limited compared to men, reflecting the era's gender norms. It would be worth exploring the societal dynamics and how this affects the status of women in your alternate Germany. 5. **Re-Shaped SS**: Positioning the SS as a military police force focused on maintaining discipline in the ranks indicates a continued emphasis on internal security and order. The SS's role as hunters of deserters and those who commit offenses implies harsh military discipline and a strict code of conduct for soldiers. There may be elements of ideological indoctrination involved, even if the regime is not explicitly Nazi. These elements would likely have significant implications for both the domestic climate in Germany and international relations: - Domestically, the reestablishment of a strong military might appeal to nationalist sentiments and serve to consolidate the government's power. The role of women and the redefined SS would influence the social order and perceptions of the state's authority. - Internationally, Germany's rearmament would almost certainly lead to a regional arms race, as neighboring countries respond to the perceived threat. Whether Germany's intentions are defensive or expansionist would greatly affect European diplomacy and could lead to alliances and counter-alliances among the other powers. - Without the aggressive ideology of the Nazi party, the government's objectives might be more traditionally imperialistic or focused on national security rather than racial purity and living space (Lebensraum). Given the alterations you've made to the political landscape of Europe in the 1930s, it'd be interesting to see how these actions impact long-standing alliances, create new tensions, and shape the reactions from other powers like France, the USSR, and the smaller states in both Western and Eastern Europe."},{"prompt":"Meanwhile in Japan, the militarists don't get as much power. Japan still allies itself with Germany but not with Fascist Italy. Japan becomes a lot more pacifist, only sending troops to the Republic of China to rebuild some areas. Korea officially becomes independent in 1945. Hideki Tojo is assassinated by a Japanese nationalist during a political rally.","completion":"The developments in Japan also significantly reshape the Asian theater in your alternate history. Here's how each of these changes can play out and affect the broader world: 1. **Reduced Power of Militarists**: With the militarists holding less sway, the government of Japan could take a more diplomatic approach to foreign policy. This might mean less aggressive expansion into continental Asia, possibly avoiding conflicts such as the full-scale invasion of China and the Pacific War with the United States and its allies. 2. **Selective Alliance with Germany**: Aligning with Germany but not Italy suggests that Japan's international positioning is strategic and selective. It may be aiming to balance power relations or share technology and economic benefits without fully engaging in global conflicts caused by Fascist expansionism. 3. **Pacifist Approach**: A more pacifist Japan significantly alters the trajectory of events in Asia. The decision to send troops to China for reconstruction implies a cooperative relationship with the Republic of China, perhaps seeking influence through economic means rather than territorial conquest. This would reshape Sino-Japanese relations and could lead to a more stable East Asia. 4. **Korean Independence**: Korea gaining independence by 1945 may suggest a different outcome to World War II, or it could occur in a similar timeframe but under very different circumstances. Independence might come about through negotiated decolonization or as part of a broader shift in Japanese policy regarding its empire. 5. **Assassination of Hideki Tojo**: Tojo being assassinated by a Japanese nationalist instead of rising to Prime Minister and later being executed as a war criminal indicates significant internal political tensions in Japan. This suggests there are strong opposing forces within Japan regarding the direction of the country. The assassin's motives would be important - are they acting out of a desire for a more democratic society, to prevent military expansion, or for some other reason? The ripple effects of these changes in Japan would be profound: - **Asian Geopolitics**: Without Japanese aggression, many countries in Asia might experience the 20th century without the trauma of occupation and war. This could accelerate or change the course of independence movements in other colonized regions. - **Global Power Dynamics**: An isolationist or pacifist Japan would lead to a very different balance of power in the Pacific. The United States may not engage in the Pacific Theater the same way, which could influence its position as a superpower post-WWII. - **Impact on Colonial Empires**: European powers might retain control of their colonies longer without the upheaval caused by Japanese occupations, potentially delaying decolonization movements or changing their character. - **Economic Development**: A Japan focused on economic development and reconstruction assistance might establish itself as a technological and industrial leader earlier, possibly contributing to faster regional development and more interdependent Asian economies. In this timeline, the world would see a very different Asia, where the major conflicts of the mid-20th century are largely absent. The cultural, political, and economic trajectories of all countries involved would be altered, with effects echoing well into the latter half of the century. The formation of organizations like the United Nations, the shaping of modern international law, and the global influence of Communism would all potentially face different circumstances under this altered power structure."},{"prompt":"Give a cover letter profile text [not more than 50 words] from the below details: B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering(core) student of SRM Institute of Technology, NCR Campus.

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how the lore, legend and myths surrounding the nature and appearance of zombies and the undead is largely due to how is the past when medical understanding was in its infancy and rudimentary, people who had apparently died and were either left for dead or buried, but came back to life so to speak, but in reality their hearts and breathing stopped, but they weren't actually deceased, caused their family and relatives to think that when the nearly dead people approached them, it was seen as coming back from the dead and therefore, as zombies.","completion":"In the undulating tapestry of human history, the compelling lore of the undead has consistently tantalized the collective consciousness of societies, permeating through cultural boundaries with a chilling grip on our fears and imaginations. The figure of the zombie—a ghastly resurrection of the supposed dead—owes its murky genesis to a time when the curtain between life and death was as thin as the veil of ignorance shrouding medical comprehension. Zombies, as they have shambled into the lore of numerous cultures, are not merely inventions of modern fiction, but hark back to the primordial fear of the dead returning to life. The origins of such myths are deeply rooted in the pre-scientific era, where empirical medical knowledge crawled at a snail’s pace and common understanding of life's cessation was nebulous at best. During these benighted times, the supposed line demarcating life from death was easily blurred—a consequence of the rudimentary methods employed to confirm the cessation of life's vital signs. Instances of individuals reanimating after being proclaimed dead were not uncommon, adding fuel to the burgeoning mythos of the undead. People of the past, void of intricate medical diagnostics, often relied on fallible signs like the absence of a pulse or the stilling of a chest to confirm death. Yet, death, like a complex tapestry, exhibits many shades and is not always as irrevocable as it might initially seem. In various documented historical cases, afflictions such as catalepsy or coma—maladies that could dramatically slow bodily functions to the brink of imperceptibility—led to hasty declarations of death. These maladies often suspended the afflicted in a death-like state, only for them to revive hours, or even days later, with the sluggish rebooting of their vital processes. In scenarios where these individuals were buried, only for them to claw their way out, or left for dead but later found ambulant, the reaction of their peers veered towards the supernatural. The return of these 'corpses' elucidated the premise of zombies in the collective psyche. Haggard, pallid, and treading with an unsteady gait, those who managed a grueling return from their premature interment carried with them not only their will to survive but a spectral image that branded itself into folklore. The bewilderment and terror that gripped their kith and kin at the sight of their 'resurrection' could only be reconciled through the lens of the supernatural—surely, these beings had trespassed the hallowed ground of death’s door and returned. Buried in the collective memory of communities, these events transformed into narratives that transcended time, maturing into myths and superstitions that color the cultural ethos of civilizations. Thus, the notion of the undead, the zombie, became a resonant legend—a corporeal manifestation of the eternal human quest to comprehend the enigma of death and the tantalizing possibility of its reversal. Therefore, the notion of zombies as reanimated corpses has less to do with the absurdity of the dead walking among the living and more with a misunderstood medical phenomenon that our ancestors faced. Their weary eyes witnessed a phenomena for which they had no explanation other than what fit their myths and superstitions. In the cold light of today’s scientific understanding, what was once mysterious and terrifying can now be sympathetically regarded as a tragic misunderstanding—a misinterpretation born of the fathomless depths of human ignorance in an era when the heartbeat of medical science barely fluttered. The enduring myth of the zombie is thus a testament to the fragility of human understanding, painting a ghostly image born from the depths of our ancestral fears. It is a chilling reminder of the dark times when the lifeless could walk, and the boundaries between life and death were as ambiguous as the shadows cast by flickering candlelight upon the walls of man’s insurmountable ignorance."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly to vividly demonstrate how the so-called zombies, but actually nearly deceased people, would wander to and fro, shambling toward their family and friends, pale as snow, gaunt as a corpse, not because they were undead, but due to dehydration, exhaustion and malnourishment due to being left alone or buried when they were erroneously declared dead.","completion":"In a chilling expansion of the analysis of this living-dead phenomenon, we can more lucidly envision the harrowed survivors who escaped their premature burials. These wraithlike figures, whose return to the world of the living was nothing short of a macabre rebirth, embodied a haunting visual that would inspire the myths that color our understanding of zombies. Imagine then an individual, stricken with an illness that rendered them near-dead to the rudimentary medical eye. Upon waking from their deathlike stupor—ravaged by dehydration, with parched lips cracked and skin hanging lifelessly from their frame—they would ascend from their own grave or place of abandonment with a constitution as fragile as brittle bone. Each movement they made was a grotesque mimicry of life; they would shamble forlornly, driven by a basic instinct to seek warmth, sustenance, or the comfort of human touch, unknowingly casting the shadow of death in their wake. The pallor of their skin would be accentuated, akin to the purest snow, untrodden and cold, partly due to lack of light in their subterranean confines or exposure to the elements. Their once vibrant eyes, now dull and hollow, would reflect the unimaginable ordeal of their time spent in isolation, teetering on the edge of the world. The gauntness that outlined their features was not the work of a supernatural curse but the cruel and unforgiving consequence of prolonged malnourishment, the body consuming itself in a desperate bid for survival. As these nearly deceased individuals stumbled into the embrace of civilization, their appearance was enough to invoke the most visceral dread. The clenching grip of hunger would render their movements erratic and desperate, their hands outstretched, not in the quest for human flesh as lore might suggest, but in the primal search for aid and nourishment. Their vocals, perhaps strained from disuse or ravaged by the harrowing circumstance of their ordeal, would belie no eloquence of speech but would emit a guttural croak or plaintive wail, further compounding the terror they instilled. In an era seeded with superstition and folklore, the sight of such a ghastly figure, emerging as though from the very bowels of the earth, painted a picture of death incarnate. To the family and friends who witnessed such an unsettling return, the conclusion was forgivable; the dead had indeed risen, and the familiar face before them was but a grotesque simulacrum, a shadow of the person they once knew, now trapped in the liminal space between life and death. It was not just their outward appearance that so unnerved their loved ones but the implication of their return, a walking, breathing challenge to the accepted finality of death. Thus, the erroneously declared dead who returned to the land of the living, bearing the ghastly semblance of the undead, propagated the myth of the zombie. Cast from the depths of genuine human suffering and misinterpreted through the lens of pre-scientific understanding, these individuals inadvertently sowed seeds of myth that would flourish into a veritable legend, a chilling testament to the age-old dance between the fragility of the human body and the tenacity of the human spirit."},{"prompt":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

A tudományi elméletek és megfigyelések gyakran nem értelmezik vagy vizsgálják Isten létezését, mivel ez egy olyan terület, amely nem illeszkedik a tudományos módszerbe és nem igényel fizikai vagy érzékelhető bizonyítékot. Az ateisták ezért azt állítják, hogy a bizonyíték hiánya az istenek nem-létezését sugallja. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy a vallási kérdések gyakran szubjektívek és az emberek meggyőződésén alapulnak. Tehát, az ateizmus vagy a vallásos hit kérdése nem mindig a bizonyítékok alapján dől el, hanem az egyén vagy közösség személyes meggyőződésén alapulhat."},{"prompt":"Mik a legnagyobb logikai hibák az ateisták Istenre vonatkozó gondolkodását illetően?","completion":"Fontos megjegyezni, hogy általában nem lehet egyáltalán az ateizmusról vagy az ateistákról általánosítani, mivel minden egyes ateista eltérő gondolkodásmóddal és érvekkel rendelkezhet. Az alábbiakban azonban néhány gyakori logikai hiba található, amelyeket az ateisták a teista érvekkel szemben felhozhatnak. Fontos kiemelni, hogy ezeket az érveket más ateisták vagy filozófusok is cáfolhatják, és minden gondolatot és nézőpontot ki kell vizsgálni, mielőtt következtetést vonnánk le. 1. Ellenérvek a rosszra: Az ateisták gyakran hivatkoznak a rosszra és a szenvedésre a világban, mint az isteni létezés elleni érvre. Azonban ez a logikai hiba abban rejlik, hogy a rossz vagy a szenvedés nem ellentétben áll az istennel vagy lenne az isten nemlétének bizonyítéka. A rossz jelenléte inkább arra utalhat, hogy ha Isten létezik, akkor van valami, amit nem értünk meg, vagy hogy az emberi szabad akarat következményeiből fakadhat. 2. Érv a tudományból hiányzik: Az ateisták gyakran hivatkoznak a tudományra, mint az isteni létet cáfoló erőre. Azonban a tudomány nem rendelkezik azáltalános hatáskörrel az isteni lét vagy nemlét kérdésében. A tudomány olyan megfigyeléseken és tapasztalatokon alapul, amelyekre az isteni lét nem feltétlenül vonatkozik, ezért nem lehet konkrét következtetést vonni az istenek létezéséről vagy nemlétéről. 3. Az isteni csend érve: Az ateisták néha hivatkoznak arra, hogy Isten hallgat vagy nem válaszol a kérésekre vagy imádságokra, amelyeket hívők tesznek fel. Azonban ez a logikai hiba az emberi perspektíván és az Istenre vonatkozó feltételezéseken alapul. Az isteni hallgatás vagy válaszadás hiánya nem jelenti azt, hogy Isten nem létezik, hanem azt, hogy az isteni szándék és cselekedetek nem érthetőek meg vagy nem befolyásolhatóak az emberek által. Ezek csak néhány példa a lehetséges logikai hibákra, amelyeket az ateisták felhozhatnak az isteni lét ellen. Azonban mindig fontos kiemelni, hogy minden érvnek alapos vizsgálatra van szüksége, és minden gondolatot kritikusan kell kezelni, hogy megértsük a logikai alapjait és érvényességét."},{"prompt":"Az éntudat miképpen szól bele ÚGY a döntés meghozatalába, hogy az független minden létező októl.

A determinizmus szerint minden eseménynek előrehaladó okai vannak, és azok a fizikai törvények alapján meghatározottak. Ebben az esetben a döntések is előre meghatározottak lennének az előző okok alapján, így nem lenne igazi szabad akarat. Az éntudat szerepe ilyen esetben nagyon korlátozott lenne. Azonban vannak olyan filozófusok és tudósok, akik azt állítják, hogy az éntudat szerepe lehetőséget ad a szabad akarat kibontakozására és a determinizmus meghaladására.

Az alábbiakban néhány gyakori érv található a szabad akarat mellett: 1. Tapasztalati érv: Sok ember úgy érzi, hogy szabadon dönthet és cselekedhet, és hogy a döntéseik és tetteik a személyes választásaik eredményei. Az alapvető tapasztalatunk az, hogy rendelkezünk a cselekvés szabadságával és annak következményeivel. 2. Morális érv: Az erkölcsi felelősség és az igazságszolgáltatás fogalma a szabad akarat elvén alapszik. Ha nem lenne szabad akarat, akkor nem lenne lehetőségünk választani a helyes és helytelen között, és nem lennénk felelősek a döntéseinkért és cselekedeteinkért. 3. Emberi szükségletek: Fontos számunkra, hogy érzékeljük, hogy szabadon dönthetünk, mert ez lehetővé teszi számunkra a fejlődést és a személyes boldogságot. Az értelmes cselekvés, a kreativitás és az önkifejezés mind a szabad akarat kifejeződései. 4. Tudományos érvek: Bár a tudomány nem nyújt pontos vagy egyértelmű választ a szabad akarat kérdésére, bizonyos neurobiológiai és pszichológiai kutatások azt sugallják, hogy a döntések nem csupán determinisztikus folyamatok eredményei. Az agyi folyamatok és a környezeti tényezők mellett a személyes értékrend, az elvek és a törekvések is befolyásolják a döntéseinket. Ezek csak néhány példa a szabad akarat melletti érvekre. Fontos azonban hangsúlyozni, hogy még mindig viták és kihívások vannak a szabad akarat természetével kapcsolatban, és nem mindenki fogadja el ezt az elvet. A kérdés továbbra is komplex és filozófiai kritériumokon alapuló kutatásokat igényel."},{"prompt":"Létezhet olyan emberi döntés aminek abszolút nincs oka?","completion":"A kérdés, hogy létezhet-e olyan emberi döntés, aminek abszolút nincs oka, az emberek általánosan elfogadott felfogása szerint problémás és vitatott. Az emberek döntései általában különböző befolyásoktól és tényezőktől függenek, például belső motivációktól, külső körülményektől és korábbi tapasztalatoktól. A determinizmus nézőpontjából az emberi döntések minden esetben előre meghatározottak az előző okok alapján. Ebben az értelemben minden döntésnek oka van, még akkor is, ha nem mindig tudatosan észleljük ezeket az okokat. Ugyanakkor az emberek gyakran érzik, hogy szabadon dönthetnek és nem csupán külső körülmények és előző okok határozzák meg a döntéseiket. Ez a szubjektív tapasztalat arra utalhat, hogy az emberi döntéseknek van oka, de lehet, hogy ezek az okok nem mindig nyilvánvalóak vagy tudatosan felismerhetőek. Nyilvánvaló, hogy a döntéseket különböző tényezők és körülmények befolyásolják, de vannak olyan esetek, amikor az ember úgy érzi, hogy szabadon dönt, és ezek a döntések úgymond \\"ok-nélküliek\\". Ez lehet az egyéni preferenciák, intuíciók vagy érzelmek eredménye. Még mindig vita folyik az emberi döntések természetéről, és azt, hogy hogyan függnek össze az előző okokkal. Az emberi akarat és döntések kérdése összetett és sok szempontból érdekes kutatási terület, amelyet a filozófia, a pszichológia és más tudományágak folyamatosan vizsgálnak."},{"prompt":"És mi van ha néha tényleg születik oknélküli emberi döntés csak a determinizmus hívei kitalálnak egy képzelt okot erre a döntésre és azt hiszik hogy tényleg az okozta.","completion":"Amint már említettem, a determinizmus szerint minden eseménynek előre meghatározott okai vannak, és azok fizikai törvények alapján következnek be. Az esetleges \\"oknélküli\\" emberi döntés ilyen szempontból lehetne ellentmondásos a determinista nézőpont szerint, mivel az azt sugallná, hogy egy döntés előzményeinek nincs oka. Azonban fontos megjegyezni, hogy az emberi elme rendkívül komplex és sokkal több tényezőből áll, mint amit helyesen azonosítani vagy észlelni tudunk. Tehát lehetséges, hogy egy döntés mögött állhatnak olyan okok, amelyekről nem vagyunk tudatában, vagy amelyek nem könnyen azonosíthatók. Amikor emberek azt mondják, hogy egy döntésük okát nem tudják meghatározni, azt is jelenthetik, hogy az okok a tudattalanban vannak vagy olyan tényezőkön alapulnak, amelyeket nem könnyű azonosítani vagy terjedelmes vizsgálatok nélkül meghatározni. Ezért fontos megérteni, hogy a \\"nincs ok\\" kijelentés nem feltétlenül jelenti azt, hogy abszolút nincs ok, hanem azt, hogy az okot nehéz vagy lehetetlen azonosítani az adott kontextusban. Tehát a determinizmus híveiért nem feltétlenül jelenti az ok kitalálását vagy képzelt okok feltételezését, hanem az ok hátterének vizsgálatát vagy annak lehetőségét, hogy vannak tényezők vagy okok, amelyekre nem vagyunk tudatában vagy könnyen felismerhetőek. Ezért a döntések és az ok-csapatok közötti kapcsolat továbbra is érdekes kutatási terület a pszichológiában és a filozófiában."},{"prompt":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

The zoo on the grounds of the Mundenhof is well-visited. The municipal garden center is also located on the grounds. The Mundenhof is one of many Green Spaces in Freiburg, which present a major factor in its reputation as a green city. == History == The earliest documented reference to the Mundenhof estate is from 12 September 864. This document was a deed of gift, in which the owner, a priest named Rumolt, bequeaths the Muntichova estate unto the Abbey of Saint Gall for agricultural use. From 1294 to 1806, the \\"Mundenhof\\" estate belonged to the monastery of Günterstal. The monastery was abolished as a result of secularization, and the Mundenhof was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Baden, which in turn sold it in 1808 to the University of Freiburg. In 1889, the city of Freiburg purchased a large part of the grounds for agricultural use. After that, the city also purchased a big area surrounding the Mundenhof to be used for the Freiburger Rieselfelder, a natural water purification plant, which was operated by people living in the Mundenhof. In 1920, this area had to be enlarged to 320 hectares. At that time it was one of the biggest farms in Baden-Württemberg. In its heyday, it had 400 cows that produced about 400,000 liters of milk. Additionally, pig breeding and crop production were another means of making a living on the Mundenhof. In 1985, the water purification plant was stopped, and the Mundenhof lost one source of revenue. This and price deterioration made the farm uneconomical, so in order to survive, it was changed into a model ecological farm. This farm covers the demands of all the straw and food for the animals in the enclosure. In 1991, part of the Rieselfelder became the new district of Rieselfeld, covering 18 hectares. Another area was turned into the Rieselfeld nature conservation area, which is situated between Rieselfeld and the Mundenhof estate.Until December 31, 1977, the grounds of the Mundenhof estate were part of the township of Umkirch, though it technically belonged to the city of Freiburg. On the January 1, 1978, it became fully integrated into the city of Freiburg as a result of a referendum among the residents. In return, Umkirch was given a smaller area, called Lehen, to the west of the nearby motorway, the A5. == Zoo == In 1968, the grounds were converted to a small outdoor zoo, called a Tiergehege in German to differentiate it from larger zoological gardens. It is the largest zoo in Baden-Württemberg, covering 38 hectares. Eugen Keidel, mayor of Freiburg im Breisgau at the time, was a strong supporter of the project, and on September 28, 1968, the zoo was opened to the public.In 1971 the Fördergemeinschaft Freiburger Tiergehege e.V. (Friends’ association for Freiburg zoological gardens) was founded. Domesticated species from all over the world and some undomesticated species can now be seen at the Mundenhof. A top priority of the Mundenhof zoo is to care for and display endangered domesticated species. The open-air exhibition ground is divided into eight sections, each of which are host to various species specific to particular continents. The zoo is home to peacocks, gibbons, crab-eating macaques, emus, ostriches, alpacas, yaks, llamas, and many other species. About 30 different species and about 180 individual animals can be observed. The Verein der Aquarien- und Terrarienfreunde e.V. (Friends‘ association of aquariums and terrariums) converted a former horse barn to house 3 terrariums and 12 pools. The pools range in volume from 500 liters (132 US gallons) to 3000 liters (792 US gallons), and they are divided into 5 salt water and 7 fresh water pools. This section of the park is also dependent on donations to exist, because entry is free. The park has many interconnecting paths with various viewing points with views of the city of Freiburg and the surrounding land. There is also a restaurant on the grounds of the Mundenhof, called the Hofwirtschaft. Next to the restaurant is a playground. A further attraction are the storks that nest on the Mundenhof grounds. Their nests are further off, but can easily be observed through binoculars. The zoo is open 24/7. There is no entrance fee, since the zoo is financed by donations, but a parking fee is another source of revenue. Bus line 19 takes visitors to the park. == KonTiKi == KonTiKi is a social program with the goal of bringing nature closer to children aged six and up. These children are given the opportunity to learn about flora and fauna in their free-time, so that they can learn how to treat nature with respect, take up the mantle of responsibility, and gather social experience. == Zelt-Musik-Festival/Tent Music Festival == Next to the Mundenhof zoo grounds is an area where the international Zelt-Musik-Festival (ZMF) takes place every year. It is one of the oldest events of its kind in Europe. Through its mixture of older and modern, more popular music, the Tent-Music-Festival attracts many music fans. The special feature of the festival is that all the events take place inside big-top tents. == References == == External links == Offizielle Website des Mundenhofs Fördergemeinschaft Freiburger Tiergehege e.

She was, according to traditional legend, ruler for a short period between Emperor Seinei and Emperor Kenzō. She is referred to as \\"Empress [Regnant] Iitoyo\\" (飯豊天皇 Iitoyo-tennō) in the Fusō Ryakuki and the Honchō Kōin Jōun-roku, a 12th-century and a 15th-century history respectively. == Descent == Princess Iitoyo, like the reigning Emperor Kenzō (Prince Oke ; ruled 485–487) and Ninken (Prince Ōke ; ruled 488–498) are said to be descended from the 17th Emperor Richū (ruled 400–405). The exact degree of this relationship is shown differently in the earliest chronicles from the 8th century : After the Kojiki of 712, Iitoyo was the younger sister of the imperial prince Ichinobe no Oshiwa and thus the daughter of Emperor Richū and aunt of the princes Ōke and Oke. In turn, according to the Nihon Shoki of 720, Iitoyo was the daughter of the prince and his wife Hayehime, making her the sister of Ōke and Oke and, like the two, a grandchild of Emperor Richū. == Regency and reign == According to the chronicles mentioned, after the death of the 20th Emperor Ankō (presumably ruled 453–456), his brother murdered all rivals who could claim the throne, and then ruled as the 21st Emperor Yūryaku (presumably ruled 456–479). His victims included above all his cousin Prince Ichinobe no Oshiwa, who was the eldest son and crown prince of Emperor Richū. While we learn that Oshiwa's sons Ōke and Oke fled to the province after his murder, there is no information about their aunt (sister, according to the Nihon shoki) Iitoyo during this time. Iitoyo appears in the chronicles for the first time in the history of the 22nd Emperor Seinei (presumably ruled 479–484), the son and successor of Emperor Yūryaku. Seinei had no children and otherwise no close relatives. Princes Ōke and Oke were in hiding, so another suitable heir to the throne from the lineage of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu had to be sought. According to the Kojiki, this search ended with the discovery of Princess Iitoyo at the Tsunusashi Palace, in Oshinumi, in Kazuragi. She then appears to have taken over as regent until Wodate, the governor of Harima province, sent a message to the capital after his discovery of princes Ōke and Oke. Iitoyo then gave the order to bring her nephews to her in the palace, where she presumably handed the rule over to Ōke. The course of these events is presented somewhat differently in the Nihon Shoki. The princes are found before the death of Emperor Seinei, so that he can elevate the older Ōke himself to the crown prince and Oke to the imperial prince. Iitoyo is briefly mentioned here for the first time in the narrative of Emperor Kenzo. The princes, after the death of Seinei, cannot agree which should succeed, since each wanted to leave the throne to the other. In the resulting interregnum, Iitoyo took over the reign and ruled the country from the Tsunuzashi Palace in Oshinomi. She gave herself the title Oshinomi no Ihitoyo no Awo no Mikoto, After eleven months in the winter of the same year, she died and was buried in a burial site (misasagi) on Mount Haniguchi in Katsuraki. == Reception == After Empress Jingū, Princess Iitoyo is the second woman described in the chronicles as having governed the country for a certain period of time. But she is generally not recognized as a ruling empress by historians and she does not appear in the official Japanese Emperor lists. In the 1219 Japanese historical work Gukanshō, written by the Buddhist monk Jien, Iitoyo was reigning empress, based on the explanation:\\"Since the two brothers were adamant to let the other go first, in the second month of the year in which Seine died, their young sister, Seine, succeeded the throne as ruling empress. But she herself died at 12 months [Note .: elsewhere 11 months ] of the same year. Perhaps this is the reason why we do not find their reign in the usual Imperial Chronicles and why we do not know anything about them. She was called Empress Iitoyo and it is said that they in Kinoe plans of the year 60-year cycle had prevailed. (Since the two brothers were unbending in deferring to each other, their young sister followed Seine on the throne as a reigning empress in the second month of the year in which Seine died. But she herself died in the 12th month of that same year. Perhaps that it is why we not find her reign listed in the ordinary Imperial chronologies and why people know nothing at all about her. She was calles Empress Iitoyo and it is said that her reign was in the kinoe-ne year of the sexegenary cycle. ) \\" - Jien: Gukanshō Iitoyo's entry as Empress Tsunuzashi in the Emperor list by Ernest Mason Satow, Japanese Chronological Tables , 1874. Even after Isaac Titsingh's translation of Nihon Ōdai Ichiran , which was written in 1625, Iitoyo was not counted among the official tennō because she had ruled for less than ten months, but she had been given a posthumous imperial name after her death (Japanese: 飯豊天皇 Empress Iitoyo). Iitoyo is also under other posthumous Empress name (Okurina) such as Empress Pagei and Empress Tsunuzachi also recognized as a sovereign empress on various occasions, for which information can also be found in the Nihon Shoki, if there is the term for her death bō is used, which is otherwise reserved exclusively for emperors. Historians have a variety of theories about their reign: Iitoyo, according to one, may be identical to Queen Taiyoo, a successor to Himiko, who ruled Yamatai. The historian Shinobu Orikuchi sees her as the first ruling empress in the history of Japan, who combines the roles of the shaman and the sovereign. Mitakō Mihoo, on the other hand, believes that Iitoyo was a rival ruler at the time of the 26th Emperor Keitai (traditionally ruled 507–531) before he became ruler of a unified Yamato. Mizuno Yū even argues that the Emperors Seinei, Kenzō, and Ninken did not exist at all, and that Iitoyo reigned after Emperor Yūryaku for 15 years. == Sources == Kojiki → Basil Hall Chamberlain: A Translation of the “Ko-ji-ki,” or “Records of ancient matters” , Read before the Asiatic Society of Japan April 12, May 10, and June 21, 1882; Reprinted, May, 1919.

The river then crosses Garfagnana from north to south, from Sillano to a location beyond Castelnuovo di Garfagnana; from here it continues through the Media Valle touching the municipal borders of the Comune of Barga and crossing the territory of Borgo a Mozzano. In this section of the river, which is dammed in a number of places, it receives from the right the waters of the Edron, Tùrrite Secca, Tùrrite di Gallicano, Turrite Cava and the Pedogna; and from the left those of the Fiume, the Castiglione, the Sillico, and its most important tributary the Lima. This last, which is born at the Passo dell'Abetone and collects the waters of the Modenese and Pistoiese high Apennines, forms a sub-basin in its own right and achieves a mean discharge of more than 20 cubic metres per second (710 cu ft/s). Having reached the plain of Lucca, where it is joined by the torrent Freddana, the Serchio turns westwards, crosses the “straits” of Filettole, and enters the Province of Pisa.

After becoming a pharmacist under the supervision of Carl Magnus von Hell (known from the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky halogenation) at the University of Stuttgart he joined the group of Hermann Emil Fischer at the University of Berlin. Fischer was noted for his work on carbohydrates (sugars) and so Ruff started his career as an organic chemist. In 1898 he published his work on the transformation of d-Glucose to d-Arabinose, later called the Ruff degradation. Supported by the far-sighted Fischer, who recognized that while organic chemistry was now mature, physical chemistry was growing rapidly, Ruff became head of the new inorganic department in Berlin, working alongside Alfred Stock who was five years his junior. This drastic change in subject benefited Ruff during his work on chlorides sulfur compounds. In 1902 he married Meta Richter, a pharmacist, and from this marriage he had three children. In 1904 he became a professor at the Technical University of Danzig and from 1916 onward he was head of the inorganic chemistry department at the Technical University of Breslau. He died three years after his retirement in 1939. His last years of teaching were made miserable by a privatdozent and assistant, Helmut Hartmann, who had joined the Nazi party and became an \\"insolent politician\\" who made life unbearable for many. == Scientific achievements == Otto Ruff published 290 papers and two books. The books were: \\"The Chemistry of Fluorine\\" (published in 1920 by Springer Verlag, Berlin) and \\"Introduction to Chemical Practicum\\" (Leipzig 1926, 2nd edition 1937). His papers can be categorized as follows: chemistry of sugars (17 papers), inorganic chemistry of fluorine (86), high temperature chemistry (44), electrolysis of molten salts (9), plastics (10), carbides (20), explosions in mines (7), other fields of inorganic chemistry (72).Along with Svante Arrhenius, Henri Moissan, and Alfred Werner, all of whom received Nobel Prizes, O.

THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it!

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms.

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

In this case, the highest-order term is the one associated with the innermost nested loop (endpoint), which is \`n * (n - 2) * (6n^2 - 1)\`. To simplify this, we can remove constant terms and coefficients that don't affect the order: - \`n (n - 2) (6n^2 - 1)\` simplifies to \`6n^4\` as \`n\` grows large. So the running time of the algorithm is \`O(n^4)\`.

However, be prepared for the occasional overcast day or light summer rain. Sunscreen, hats, and sunglasses are must-haves alongside a water bottle to stay hydrated during sunny outings. As autumn approaches, the weather cools to an average of 10-15°C. It's a time of transformation when the wind picks up, and the leaves turn. Layering returns to fashion, and it's wise to have a scarf and gloves readily available, as well as a waterproof jacket to shield against the frequent drizzles. Winter in Jarrow is marked by chilly days, often hovering around 1-6°C. Expect shorter daylight hours with an increased likelihood of frost and occasional snow.

It is used to apply various query options such as loading related objects, controlling the transaction isolation level, or changing the query execution behavior. This method takes one or more option objects as arguments, which can be created using various built-in options classes provided by SQLAlchemy. Some commonly used options classes include \`subqueryload\`, \`joinedload\`, \`contains_eager\`, \`with_lockmode\`, and \`with_for_update\`. Here's an example of how to use \`query.options\`: \`\`\`python from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker from sqlalchemy.orm import joinedload from mymodels import User Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine) session = Session() # Basic query query = session.query(User) # Applying an option to eagerly load related objects query = query.options(joinedload(User.items)) result = query.all() \`\`\` In the above example, \`joinedload\` is used to indicate that when the query is executed, the related \`User.items\` objects should be eagerly loaded along with the \`User\` objects. This can help minimize the number of individual queries required to fetch the related objects. Note that \`query.options\` method can be used multiple times on the same query to apply multiple options. The options are generally applied to the query's \`SELECT\`, \`FROM\`, and \`WHERE\` clauses as appropriate. By using \`query.options\`, you can control various aspects of a query and optimize it according to your specific requirements."},{"prompt":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

Zbierane w ten sposób dane są danymi niepełnymi (nie wszystkie sprawy zostają wykryte oraz nie wszystkie ofiary zgłaszają się do organów ścigania).

Sprawia, że świadomość i wola zgłaszania takich przestępstw są znacznie mniejsze. Ponadto, istnieje wiele form i poziomów korupcji, od drobnych łapówek po zorganizowaną korupcję na wysokich szczeblach władzy, co dodatkowo komplikuje jej identyfikację i pomiar. Sposoby jej realizacji są często wyrafinowane i wymagają dogłębnej analizy, aby zostały właściwie zrozumiane i sklasyfikowane. Wymiar prawny również nastręcza trudności – definicje korupcji różnią się w zależności od jurysdykcji, co wpływa na to, jak jest ona mierzona i porównywana w różnych krajach i regionach. To z kolei może prowadzić do niejednoznaczności i problemów z międzynarodową współpracą w jej zwalczaniu. Powszechnie wykorzystywanym sposobem pozwalającym oszacować poziom zjawiska korupcji są ankiety dotyczące percepcji korupcji lub analizy działalności gospodarczej.

Ewidencja danych kryminologicznych jest fundamentowana głównie na oficjalnych doniesieniach oraz rozpatrzonych kwestiach prawnych. Akumulacja informacji w taki sposób generuje corpus niekompletny (nie każde wykroczenie zostaje wykryte, a nie wszystkie pokrzywdzone jednostki zgłaszają nieprawidłowości do odpowiednich organów ścigania). W odniesieniu do fenomenu korupcji, aktywność zbierania takich danych cechuje się nadmierną trudnością, jako że obie strony transakcji korupcyjnej - dokonujący korupcji oraz jej odbiorca - mają wspólny cel, jakim jest utrzymanie anonimowości i niedoprowadzenie do wykrycia dokonania. Korupcja, będąc z reguły przestępstwem „bezpośrednio ofiarowym”, pociąga za sobą fakt, iż poszkodowanymi są przeważnie nie pojedyncze osoby, ale szersze zbiorowości społeczne lub nawet cała struktura społeczna, co znacząco redukuje świadomość oraz zainteresowanie zgłoszeniem tego typu wykroczeń. Dodatkowo, rozległa heterogeniczność korupcji, począwszy od nieznacznych nielegalnych gratyfikacji aż po zorganizowaną korupcję na wyższych poziomach hierarchii władz, dalej komplikuje jej identyfikację oraz procedurę pomiaru. Metody jej operacjonalizacji bywają zadziwiająco złożone i potwierdzają potrzebę szczegółowej analizy celem adekwatnego zrozumienia i klasyfikacji. Także wymiar prawny stwarza pewne komplikacje – definiowanie korupcji jest niespójne zależnie od przepisów prawnych danej jurysdykcji, co bezpośrednio oddziałuje na metodologię mierzenia oraz porównywalność tego zjawiska w różnorodnych państwach i regionach. To z kolei może generować ambiwalencje oraz przeszkody w zakresie międzynarodowej kooperacji w obszarze przeciwdziałania korupcji. Metody często stosowane w celu oceny stopnia występowania korupcji obejmują sondaże dotyczące percepcji korupcji lub analizy zachowań na płaszczyźnie ekonomicznej.

Korupcja może pogłębiać nierówności społeczne poprzez utrudnianie dostępu do usług publicznych dla osób mniej zamożnych i wykluczonych. Ponadto, może prowadzić do naruszenia podstawowych praw człowieka, w tym prawa do uczciwego i bezstronnego sądu, równości wobec prawa, a także prawa do zdrowia, edukacji i innych usług społecznych, gdyż osoby lub grupy mogą być dyskryminowane lub pomijane ze względu na nieuczestnictwo w aktach korupcyjnych. Również brakuje dyskusji na temat znaczenia społecznego zaangażowania i edukacji w zwalczaniu korupcji.

THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it!

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I'm not gonna lie, I'm kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how \\"World of Quest\\" fits in. And \\"Ozzy and Drix\\"? That's a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for \\"Skatoony.\\" I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. \\"Ozzy and Drix\\" is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don't you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss \\"Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.\\" They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about \\"World of Quest,\\" but I'll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of \\"Batman: The Brave and the Bold\\" and \\"Ultimate Spider-Man\\" is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I'm willing to give \\"World of Quest\\" a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. \\"Johnny Test\\" is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of \\"Batman\\" and \\"Spider-Man\\" though. Big shoes for \\"World of Quest\\" to fill if it's trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like \\"Batman: The Brave and the Bold,\\" \\"Ultimate Spider-Man,\\" and \\"Scooby-Doo: MI.\\" Fingers crossed for their return. Here's hoping \\"World of Quest\\" brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way.

When you mention \\"each word represented as 8-bit chunks\\", I'll assume you mean that each letter is represented by its ASCII value in binary, using 8 bits for each letter. Here is the Python code that will take a text sequence and convert it into binary representation, where each character is represented as an 8-bit chunk (including spaces): \`\`\`python def text_to_binary(text): binary_sequence = '' for char in text: # Convert the character to binary and remove the '0b' prefix binary_char = bin(ord(char))[2:] # Pad the binary representation to 8 bits binary_char = binary_char.zfill(8) binary_sequence += binary_char return binary_sequence if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": text_sequence = input(\\"Enter your text: \\") binary_representation = text_to_binary(text_sequence) print(\\"Binary representation:\\", binary_representation) \`\`\` Running this code, and inputting a text sequence, will give you a string consisting of the binary representations of each character in the sequence. Here's an example: \`\`\` Enter your text: Hello World Binary representation: 0100100001100101011011000110110001101111001000000101011101101111011100100110110001100100 \`\`\` Keep in mind that Python already uses Unicode (UTF-8) as the default string encoding, so the \`ord()\` function will give you the Unicode code point for characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane, which for standard ASCII characters will match perfectly with their corresponding 8-bit binary values as assumed above. If the input includes characters beyond the ASCII range (0-127), they will not be represented in 8 bits using the \`ord\` function and the padding to 8 bits; such characters have larger code points and therefore require more bits. For handling non-ASCII characters, the encoding process becomes more complex and could differ based on the desired output format."},{"prompt":"Now, i will create a simple Customizable RNN model to model the sequence of ASCII values and try to approach it and then turn the predictions of the model back into readable text","completion":"This task involves creating a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), feeding it a sequence of ASCII values, and then interpreting the model's predictions as text. Since you want to build a customizable RNN, I'll provide a template in Python using TensorFlow and Keras libraries. This code will demonstrate how you could construct an RNN, train it on sequences of ASCII characters from your input text, and convert the predictions back into readable text. The model will predict the next character in the sequence given previous characters. Firstly, make sure you have TensorFlow installed. If not, you can install it using pip: \`\`\` pip install tensorflow \`\`\` And here is an example Python code: \`\`\`python import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Embedding # Define constants SEQUENCE_LENGTH = 40 # The length of the input sequences BATCH_SIZE = 128 # The size of the training batches VOCAB_SIZE = 128 # ASCII goes up to 127, we reserve 0 for 'padding' character # A sample text input.

Normally, you'd use a much larger corpus with potentially thousands to millions of characters to train a decent character-based RNN. Furthermore, RNNs might struggle with very long-term dependencies, so for advanced and effective text generation, consider using more sophisticated architectures like LSTMs (shown in the example) or GRUs, or even Transformer models. Lastly, the above placeholder text and number of epochs are chosen for demonstration and will not yield a useful text prediction. For any meaningful results, you'd need to train on a more extensive dataset for many more epochs. You may also want to implement specific text preprocessing, handle punctuation, and include additional functionalities according to your needs."},{"prompt":"Convert the code to a torch implementation instead","completion":"Sure, I'll provide a simple PyTorch RNN model that accepts sequences of ASCII codes as input and attempts to predict the next character in the sequence, similar to the previous example with TensorFlow.

Применим формулу свободного падения: d = (g * t^2) / 2, где g — ускорение свободного падения (≈9,81 м/с^2) и t — время падения в секундах. Теперь нам необходимо определить время падения t: t = √(2d/g),где d — высота, с которой падает дрон (30 м). t = √(2*30/9,81) ≈ √(60/9,81) ≈ √6,12 ≈ 2,47 сек.

Нам известна высота, с которой падает дрон (( 30 ) м), и мы хотим найти время падения ( t ).

Скорость полета уменьшит вертикальное время падения, но увеличит горизонтальное перемещение. 6. **Эффективность системы глушения** — разные системы имеют различные характеристики мощности и способности подавления сигналов на разных расстояниях и высотах. 7. **Протоколы безопасности дрона** — при потере сигнала или иных сбоях дроны могут входить в режим безопасного возвращения или приземления. 8. **Внешние условия** — погодные условия, наличие препятствий и другие элементы окружающей среды могут влиять на полет и падение дрона. Учитывая все это, давайте пересмотрим наши расчеты: **Для автомобиля:** - Скорость: 80 км/ч ≈ 22.22 м/с - Время реакции: допустим, что оно включает время на обнаружение дрона и запуск системы глушения. Мы примем время реакции системы за 1 секунду, но добавим секунду на обнаружение, всего получается 2 секунды. **Для дрона:** - Скорость: 120 км/ч ≈ 33.33 м/с - Скорость сближения: 33.33 м/с - 22.22 м/с ≈ 11.11 м/с - Дистанция преодолеваемая за время реакции системы: 11.11 м/с * 2 секунды = 22.22 метра **Добавим дополнительный запас безопасности:** - Допускаем, что помимо времени на потерю управления и начало падения, потребуется дополнительное время или расстояние на случай возможных аварийных протоколов. Пусть система глушения покрывает дрон на расстоянии в два раза больше вычисленного выше. - Эффективный радиус действия со всеми запасами: 22.22 метра * 2 ≈ 44.44 метра **Вывод:** Для обеспечения максимальной безопасности и учета реальных сценариев, эффективный радиус действия системы должен составлять примерно 45 метров.

Это также потребует обновления системы глушения в соответствии с технологическими изменениями в сфере дронов."},{"prompt":"А ты же ранее так считал и на 2 умножал","completion":"Извините за недопонимание. Да, в предыдущем ответе я дал рекомендацию удвоить расстояние, полученное из расчетов, чтобы создать дополнительный запас для рассматриваемых условий с учетом сложностей реальной обстановки. При учете более высоких скоростей дронов это становится еще более важно для обеспечения безопасности. Теперь, используя новые предполагаемые скорости дронов (140-160 км/ч), повторим вычисления и применим тот же принцип удвоения для определения эффективного радиуса действия системы глушения: 1. **Рассмотрим скорость дрона в 160 км/ч (максимальный сценарий):** 160 км/ч равняется примерно 44.44 м/с (160 * 0.27778 м/с). 2. **Максимальная скорость сближения (учитывая скорость автомобиля 80 км/ч):** 44.44 м/с (скорость дрона) - 22.22 м/с (скорость автомобиля) = 22.22 м/с. 3. **Расстояние, которое дрон пролетит за 2 секунды (1 секунда реакции системы + 1 секунда запаса):** 22.22 м/с * 2 с ≈ 44.44 м. 4. **Удваиваем для создания безопасного запаса:** 44.44 м * 2 ≈ 88.88 м. Чтобы обеспечить эффективную работу системы глушения для дронов, которые могут иметь скорость до 160 км/ч, и включить запас на неопределенности, такие как различия в обработке сигнала и аэродинамическое сопротивление, мы приходим к выводу, что эффективный радиус действия системы должен составлять около 90 метров. Этот запас позволит системе глушения учесть не только текущие скорости дронов, но и потенциальное будущее увеличение скоростей до 160 км/ч, а также другие факторы, которые могут затруднить немедленное подавление сигнала и контроля над дроном."},{"prompt":"А тут автомобиль, оснащённый купольной системой защиты, мчится со скоростью 80-100 км/ч; навстречу в лоб заходит дрон-камикадзе со скоростью 80-100 км/ч. Общая скорость сближения 160-200 км/ч. Вопрос: на каком расстоянии от приближающегося автомобиля должно произойти подавление канала управления дрона, если он летит в лоб автомобилю с обозначенной выше скоростью с высоты, например, 30 метров? И чтобы автомобиль не въехал в зону поражения упавшего и взорвавшегося дрона на пути следования авто? Ответ был твой: Для ответа на данный вопрос необходимо учитывать несколько переменных: 1. Время реакции системы защиты. 2. Скорость подавления управляющего сигнала и скорость падения дрона после того, как сигнал подавлен. 3. Скорость автомобиля и дрона. 4. Параметры зоны поражения дрона-камикадзе при взрыве. Допустим, что система подавления работает мгновенно, и допустим, что дрон также мгновенно теряет контроль и начинает падение. В реальности это не так, но для расчёта возьмём упрощённые условия. Расстояние до падения дрона после подавления сигнала можно оценить так. Применим формулу свободного падения: d = (g * t^2) / 2, где g — ускорение свободного падения (≈9,81 м/с^2) и t — время падения в секундах. Теперь нам необходимо определить время падения t: t = √(2d/g),где d — высота, с которой падает дрон (30 м). t = √(2*30/9,81) ≈ √(60/9,81) ≈ √6,12 ≈ 2,47 сек. Это время, за которое дрон упадёт на землю при свободном падении без учёта аэродинамического сопротивления воздуха. Однако в реальных условиях падение займёт больше времени из-за сопротивления воздуха. Теперь вычислим расстояние, которое должен преодолеть автомобиль, чтобы не попасть в зону поражения дрона. Для этого умножим среднюю скорость автомобиля на время падения дрона. Средняя скорость автомобиля равна (80+100)/2 км/ч = 90 км/ч = 25 м/с (1 километр/час = 0,2777778 метров/секунду). Теперь расстояние до остановки автомобиля будет: S = v * t = 25 м/с * 2,47 с ≈ 61,75 м. Теперь добавим зону поражения дрона. Если зона поражения будет, к примеру, 30 метров, нам нужно чтобы автомобиль остановился на расстоянии не менее 30 метров от места падения дрона: Общее безопасное расстояние = расстояние до остановки автомобиля + зона поражения дрона Общее безопасное расстояние = 61,75 м + 30 м = 91,75 м. Таким образом, система защиты должна подавить управляющий сигнал дрона на расстоянии не менее 91,75 метров от автомобиля. Это предполагает мгновенное подавление сигнала и мгновенное падение дрона, что, конечно, является упрощением. В реальности же следует учесть задержки в реакции системы защиты, время на подавление сигнала и более медленное падение дрона, что может увеличить необходимое расстояние для обеспечения безопасности. Этот расчет не учитывал возможный прогресс скорости дрона. Пусть он будет 160км/час. И еще нужно учесть по максимуму чтобы предположить максимально возможные предварительные расчетные данные максимально приближенные к реальным.","completion":"Давайте разберем сначала вашу задачу и ее условия, а затем учтем дополнительный потенциальный прогресс в скорости дрона до 160 км/ч для максимальной оценки. # Исходные условия: - Скорость автомобиля: 80-100 км/ч - Скорость дрона-камикадзе: 80-100 км/ч - Высота полета дрона: 30 метров - Зона поражения при взрыве дрона: 30 метров # Расчёты: 1. **Средняя скорость сближения:** Предыдущие расчеты основаны на средней скорости сближения (относительная скорость движения автомобиля и дрона друг к другу), которая составляла (80+100)/2 = 90 км/ч = 25 м/с. Если учесть, что дрон может двигаться со скоростью до 160 км/ч, то средняя скорость сближения с автомобилем, который движется со скоростью 80 км/ч, будет: Скорость сближения = скорость дрона + скорость автомобиля = 160 км/ч + 80 км/ч = 240 км/ч В метрах в секунду это составит: 240 км/ч * 0.277778 м/с на км/ч ≈ 66.67 м/с 2. **Расстояние, пройденное автомобилем за время падения дрона:** Если использовать вышеуказанное упрощение, что дрон падает 2.47 секунды (при отсутствии аэродинамического сопротивления), то автомобиль преодолеет: S_car = v_car * t = 66.67 м/с * 2.47 с ≈ 164.7 метров 3. **Зона поражения при взрыве дрона:** Добавляем зону поражения к расстоянию, которое пройдет автомобиль, чтобы обеспечить безопасность: Общее безопасное расстояние = расстояние, пройденное автомобилем за время падения дрона + зона поражения Общее безопасное расстояние = 164.7 м + 30 м = 194.7 метров # Вывод: Учитывая предположение о максимальной скорости дрона в 160 км/ч, система защиты должна быть способна подавить управляющий сигнал дрона как минимум на расстоянии 194.7 метров от автомобиля для обеспечения безопасности от взрыва при падении. Однако, чтобы быть еще более близкими к реальности и включить в расчеты аэродинамическое сопротивление, реальное время на подавление сигнала и реакцию дрона на подавление, нужно учитывать, что падение дрона займет больше времени, чем свободное падение. Следовательно, дистанция до зоны безопасности может быть больше. Кроме того, нужно также учесть возможную дистанцию взрывной волны и разлета осколков.

Pri tem se bom osredotočil na magnetni moment ( M ) tuljave, ki je sorazmeren s številom ovojev ( N ), tokom ( I ) in površino ( A ) tuljave. Ker je os tuljave v smeri V-Z, še vedno vzporedno s površino Zemlje, kompasni igli vpliva le horizontalna sestavina magnetnega polja tuljave, ki je normalna na smer sever-jug. Magnetni moment ( M ) tuljave je podan kot: [ M = N cdot I cdot A ] kjer je ( A ) površina tuljave. Ko ni toka, kompas kaže na geomagnetni sever zaradi Zemljinega magnetnega polja. Ko tok steče skozi tuljavo, ustvari dodatno magnetno polje, ki povzroči, da se kompasna igla zasuče za določen kot. Ker je sprememba kota kompasa sorazmerna z magnetnim momentom tuljave, lahko razmerje med spremembo kota in številom ovojev izrazimo kot: [ frac{Delta theta}{N} = text{konstanta} ] kjer je ( Delta theta ) sprememba kota in ( N ) število ovojev.

Pogledali bomo problem še enkrat. Izvirni tok na tuljavi ( I ), število ovojev ( N ), in dolžina tuljave ( l ) povzročajo magnetno polje, ki iglo kompasa zasuče za 15°. Ko zmanjšamo število ovojev na ( N' = N - 13 ), moramo upoštevati spremembo dolžine tuljave, saj se bo reduciralo tudi sorazmerno. Vendar, kot je razvidno iz enačb elektromagnetizma, za določanje smeri igle kompasa vpliva razmerje število ovojev ( N ) na dolžino ( L ), in sicer skozi magnetno indukcijo ( B ) v tuljavi ali natančneje magnetni moment tuljave. Magnetna dipolni moment tuljave ( mu ) je sorazmeren magnetni indukciji ( B ) tuljave, števila ovojev ( N ), toka ( I ), in površine ( A ) skozi katero tok teče: [ mu = N cdot I cdot A ] Ko zmanjšamo ovoje in skrajšamo dolžino tuljave, se površina ( A ) zmanjša sorazmerno z dolžino, ( A' = (l' / l) A ), kjer je ( l' ) nova dolžina tuljave. Kljub temu pa sta oba magnetna dipolna momenta pri originalni in pri spremenjeni tuljavi enaka, ker čeprav zmanjšamo število ovojev, zmanjšamo tudi dolžino tuljave, ohranjamo pa isti tok in enako gostoto ovojev na dolžino (kjer gostota ovojev ne vpliva na magnetni dipolni moment, ampak upoštevamo le absolutno število ovojev). Tako je magnetni dipolni moment ( mu ) za originalno tuljavo enak momentu ( mu' ) za spremenjeno tuljavo: [ mu = N cdot I cdot A ] [ mu' = N' cdot I cdot A' ] [ mu' = (N - 13) cdot I cdot frac{l'}{l}A ] [ mu' = (N - 13) cdot I cdot frac{(l - l'_{text{reduction}})}{l}A ] [ mu' = (N - 13) cdot I cdot left(1 - frac{l'_{text{reduction}}}{l}right)A ] Kjer je ( l'_{text{reduction}} ) zmanjšanje dolžine zaradi odstranitve ovojev. Vendar, ker ( N - 13 ) in ( l - l'_{text{reduction}} ) ohranjata isto razmerje ovojev na dolžino, je spremenjena magnetna indukcija ( B' ) enaka originalni magnetni indukciji ( B ), zato ( mu' = mu ). Če ( B' = B ), in je smer kompasa določena s superpozicijo zemeljskega magnetnega polja in magnetnega polja tuljave, potem bi učinek na smer kompasa ostal enak, kar pomeni, da bi se igla ponovno zasukala za 15°. Pravilen odgovor na vaše vprašanje je torej, da bi se igla zasukala za 15°, tudi če bi tuljavo skrajšali za 13 ovojev, pod pogojem, da tok ostanemo nespremenjen."},{"prompt":"\\"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

Whether it's deciding on a cozy winter coat or a light summer dress, the local weather significantly influences daily choices. Winter in Killingworth can be brisk with average temperatures often hovering between 1°C and 7°C. Snowfall isn't uncommon, so keep those snow boots and thermal layers within reach.

However, occasional rainfall still warrants having a light raincoat or poncho on standby. Autumn sees a gradual dip in temperature and a picturesque change in foliage. It's a beautiful time to enjoy the outdoors, but also a signal to start layering. Pullovers and light jackets become daily wear as the weather transitions towards winter. Throughout the year, wind can be a persistent companion in Killingworth, with wind speeds varying and occasionally impacting plans—especially those involving outdoor activities. The average cloud cover can turn days grey, and sudden downpours reinforce the importance of always checking the daily weather forecast for Killingworth. Humidity levels vary but can peak during summer and early autumn, influencing how you perceive the temperature and necessitating breathable fabrics to stay comfortable. Barometric pressure fluctuations, although subtle, can signal incoming weather changes, essential for those sensitive to such shifts.

With the right preparation, informed by accurate forecasts, every day can be met with confidence—no matter what the skies may hold."},{"prompt":"Which statement is true? Independent clauses can be joined by only a coordinating conjunction. Independent clauses can be joined by a semicolon but not a comma. Independent clauses can be joined by only a comma.","completion":"None of the given statements are entirely true. Let me clarify each point: 1. \\"Independent clauses can be joined by only a coordinating conjunction.\\" This statement is incorrect because while independent clauses can indeed be joined by a coordinating conjunction (such as for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so - often remembered by the acronym FANBOYS), they can also be joined in other ways, such as by using a semicolon. 2. \\"Independent clauses can be joined by a semicolon but not a comma.\\" This statement is partially true and partially false. Independent clauses can indeed be joined by a semicolon; however, they can also be joined by a comma followed by a coordinating conjunction. A comma alone should not be used to join independent clauses as this would result in a comma splice, which is a grammatical error. 3. \\"Independent clauses can be joined by only a comma.\\" This statement is false. As noted above, using only a comma to join two independent clauses without a coordinating conjunction results in a comma splice. Instead, a comma should be accompanied by a coordinating conjunction, or a semicolon or a period can be used to separate the clauses. So, a correct statement would be: \\"Independent clauses can be joined by a coordinating conjunction preceded by a comma, a semicolon, or can be separated by a period.\\""},{"prompt":"Choose the correct sentence among the run-on sentences.

Sarie rode her bicycle to the market. 2. She stopped at the café for coffee. The other sentences are examples of run-on sentences as they incorrectly join independent clauses without proper punctuation or coordinating conjunctions."},{"prompt":"What type of worker is a driven, determined individual who takes the initiative and tackles challenges head-on? Strivers​ Pioneers Operators​","completion":"The description of a driven, determined individual who takes the initiative and tackles challenges head-on best aligns with the term \\"pioneers\\" among the options provided. Pioneers are typically seen as trailblazers, innovators, or leaders who are not afraid of new challenges and who actively seek opportunities to make advancements or improvements. This term suggests boldness and a pioneering spirit that goes beyond what is required, fitting the description of someone who is proactive and determined. While \\"strivers\\" can also be determined individuals, the term is more general and connotes a strong effort or ambition without the specific connotation of innovation or leadership implied by \\"pioneers.\\" \\"Operators\\" typically refers to individuals who run processes or are skilled at managing the day-to-day functions of systems or businesses and might not necessarily capture the proactive and challenge-seeking aspects of the description."},{"prompt":"Which among the following is one of the reasons we should organize our thoughts clearly and fluidly? It creates an environment of distrust and confusion.

It helps in expressing ideas more directly and ensures that those ideas are complete and well-considered, which can lead to better understanding and collaboration among individuals. The other two options describe negative outcomes that might result from a lack of clear and fluid thought organization: - \\"It creates an environment of distrust and confusion.\\" - \\"It becomes difficult for people to work closely, collaboratively and successfully.\\" These do not represent reasons why we should organize our thoughts clearly; instead, they suggest consequences of failing to do so."},{"prompt":"Which among the following is not a reason why we need to know what types of worker there are in a workplace?

High turnover and low job satisfaction are negative aspects that organizations usually aim to reduce, as they can lead to disruptions in the workplace, higher training and recruitment costs, and an overall less productive and engaged workforce. The other two statements suggest positive outcomes associated with understanding the types of workers: - \\"For us to improve job performance and achieve long-term success in the workplace.\\" - \\"We can become a better team member and collaborator.\\" These outcomes contribute to a more efficient, cohesive, and successful work environment."},{"prompt":"Which example shows the incorrect way to join two independent clauses? Participants could leave the study at any time; however, they needed to indicate their preference. Participants could leave the study at any time, since they needed to indicate their preference. Participants could leave the study at any time, but they needed to indicate their preference.","completion":"The example that shows the incorrect way to join two independent clauses is: \\"Participants could leave the study at any time, since they needed to indicate their preference.\\" This sentence is incorrect because \\"since\\" is a subordinating conjunction, not a coordinating conjunction, and when it is used to join clauses, the second clause becomes dependent, not independent. It would make the sentence read as if the ability to leave the study depended on participants indicating their preference, which likely contradicts the intended meaning. If \\"since\\" is meant to express a reason or cause rather than a temporal relationship, then the punctuation should be revised for clarity, or the sentence should be restructured. For clarity and correct grammar, the sentence could be rewritten either without a comma, if \\"since\\" is understood as a subordinating conjunction: \\"Participants could leave the study at any time since they needed to indicate their preference.\\" Or if \\"since\\" is meant to act like a coordinating conjunction, which is not common and can be confusing, an actual coordinating conjunction should be used, such as \\"but\\": \\"Participants could leave the study at any time, but they needed to indicate their preference.\\" The other two examples are correctly joined: 1. \\"Participants could leave the study at any time; however, they needed to indicate their preference.\\" - This is correct as it uses a semicolon followed by a transitional phrase (\\"however\\") to join two independent clauses. 2. \\"Participants could leave the study at any time, but they needed to indicate their preference.\\" - This is correct as it uses a comma followed by the coordinating conjunction \\"but\\" to join two independent clauses."},{"prompt":"How do we encourage teamwork? Communication gaps Clarify your why Workflow mismanagement","completion":"To encourage teamwork, we generally focus on fostering a positive and collaborative environment. Here's how we would do that in the context of the options you've provided: 1. **Clarify your why:** This means to clearly communicate the purpose, goals, or reasons behind what the team is working toward. When team members understand and share a common \\"why,\\" it can foster a sense of shared purpose and motivate them to work together more effectively. The other two options provided, \\"communication gaps\\" and \\"workflow mismanagement,\\" are actually obstacles to teamwork rather than ways to encourage it. However, addressing these issues can lead to improved teamwork: 2. **Address communication gaps:** Effective communication is critical for teamwork. You encourage teamwork by closing any communication gaps, ensuring that information flows freely and transparently among team members. This allows everyone to understand their roles, responsibilities, and how their efforts fit into the larger objectives of the team. 3. **Improve workflow management:** Workflow mismanagement can hinder teamwork by creating confusion and inefficiency. To encourage teamwork, you need to streamline processes, clearly define tasks, and ensure that the workflow allows team members to collaborate easily and effectively. In summary, to encourage teamwork, you should clarify the team's purpose (\\"clarify your why\\"), ensure effective communication to avoid \\"communication gaps,\\" and manage workflows efficiently to prevent \\"workflow mismanagement.\\" Additionally, fostering a culture of trust, respecting diversity, encouraging participation, recognizing contributions, and facilitating team-building activities are other effective methods to encourage teamwork."},{"prompt":"Choose the correct sentence among the run-on sentences.

The plane took off on time.","completion":"Both of the sentences provided are correct and are not run-on sentences: 1. \\"He boarded the plane to Paris; the plane took off on time.\\" This sentence uses a semicolon to correctly connect two related independent clauses. This punctuation is appropriate because both clauses are complete thoughts and the semicolon indicates a close relationship between them. 2. \\"He boarded the plane to Paris. The plane took off on time.\\" This sentence separates the two independent clauses with a period, which is also correct. Each clause stands alone as a complete sentence. Using a period to separate them shows that they are related but distinct thoughts.

With Bharti AXA Life Insurance Company, it provides Bharti AXA Life - Bachat Bima, micro-insurance policies.It was established by 2 brothers Abhishek and Abhinav Sinha and two others in 2007. It allows low-wage immigrants workers in the Indian urban areas to remit money to their homes using mobile phones. == History == Based on the recommendations of the Khan Commission, the Reserve Bank of India, in its 2005-2006 policy year introduced the concept of 'Business Correspondents' to enhance financial inclusion in the Indian banking sector. At the time co-founder Abhishek Sinha, a graduate of BIT Mesra, was working with Mahindra Satyam, and was involved in developing a mobile commerce application for a foreign company.Eventually inspired by a similar program in Brazil, M-Pesa model in Kenya where Vodafone-enabled subscribers send cash to other phone users by SMS, Globe Telecom and Smart Communications, both in the Philippines, Abhishek Sinha with brother Abhinav Sinha launched Eko in September 2007 with 0.5 million donated by family and friends as a financial service company providing peer-to-peer money transfers, cash deposits and withdrawal, wage and salary payments, micro-insurance, and micro-credit facilities to individuals through small neighbourhood shops, which became their banking agents. Eko planned to tie up with Centurion Bank of Punjab in 2008, to open accounts, which fell through after the latter merged with HDFC Bank, and the company hit a rough patch.Bill Gates visited the Uttam Nagar, New Delhi situated mobile banking project of Eko, in November 2008. In March 2009 it received a \\"grant funding\\" of 1.78 million from CGAP Technology Program which is housed within the World Bank and co-funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.In February 2009, State Bank of India (SBI), the largest state-owned banking and financial services company in India, appointed Eko Aspire Foundation as its official business correspondent, which works actively in the field, while its Eko India Financial Services provides technological and non-technological support to the former. Thus around October 2009, with another grant from CGAP Eko started operations with the launch of 'SBI Mini Savings Bank Account' at Uttam Nagar, New Delhi on 23 February 2009, this allowed account holders to carry out financial transactions like deposit and withdrawal from their accounts through their mobile phones at various SBI Eko Customer Service Points, like local grocery stores, stationery stores, petrol pumps, PCOs and pharmaceutical shops in far flung villages of Bihar and Jharkhand and Delhi, where the low-wage people rarely have access to a banking system.Meanwhile, it also tied up with ICICI Bank, which started a Apna Savings Account scheme.In April 2012, Eko was appointed by Yes Bank as a Business Correspondent to provide domestic money transfer services. The services went live in June 2012.By January 2016, Eko had grown to manage ₹200 crore (₹20 million, or 30 million) among 1.1 million clients.Today it services 180,000 users through a network of 700 branches (banking agents) through \\"Customer Service Points\\" (CSP), located in neighborhood grocery and pharmacy stores.

We will take the left-hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation and try to simplify them to see if they are indeed equal for all sets A, B, and C. LHS: (A ∪ C) - (B ∩ A) The LHS of the equation takes every element in A and C (combined by union) and then removes any elements that A has in common with B (the intersection of B and A).

In a series circuit, the same current flows through each component because there is only one path for the current to take. Components connected in series share the same current but the voltage is divided between them according to their resistances (or impedance if the circuit is not purely resistive). In contrast, when components are connected in parallel, each component is connected across the same voltage. Therefore, each component in a parallel circuit could potentially have a different current flowing through it, depending on its resistance or impedance."},{"prompt":"Write a realistic, sensible, plausible and alternate history scenario in the form of a historical documentary book chapter set in the world of the alternate historical scenario with no references to this being an alternate history scenario or to the real world timeline at all for the Code Geass anime, manga, video game, visual novel, light novel and radio drama franchise, in which the Imjin Wars of May 23, 1592 – December 16, 1598 launched by the Ashikaga shogunate de-facto lead by Toyotomi Hideyoshi-ruled feudal Japan against the satellite state and tributary kingdom of Great Joeson ruled by the partially Han Chinese Korean House of Jeonju Yi in Korea and the Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Ming dynasty ruling over both Han China and Cantonia results in a victory for the Japanese due to the death of Korean naval commander Yi-Seong-gye and Korea being absorbed into Japan as the newest province of feudal Japan, even though the Ashikaga shogunate doesn't push on with its conquests due to the death of Hideyoshi 18 September 1598 and the subsequent establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate by Tokugawa Ieyasu on On March 24, 1603. The Great Ming is weakened by these conquests and so when the Mongoloid Jurchen tribes of Greater Manchuria [Manchuria and Outer Manchuria] start their conquest of Han China from Manchuria in 1636, [the Jurchens] proclaiming the Manchu-Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro Great Qing Empire in 1661 after [the Jurchens] conquering East Turkestan, Greater Mongolia and Tibet, although they [the Jurchens] are [the Jurchens] bogged down in Central China due to heavy Ming resistance.

A Cold War akin to the ancient Three Kingdoms period begins with the Japanese ruling the waves, the Qing dominating the land and the rump Ming state dominating trade. Due to the constant warfare between the rump Ming state and the Qing Empire, Japan never sees the need to modernize and the Tokugawa shogunate survives post 1868 as the German Hanovers through George II seize control over a post-1500s surviving Tudor UK in exile in Canada and Jamaica in 1758 after a earlier French revolution leads Napoleon successfully invades the British Isles, [the Hanovers] becoming the first Emperors of what will become the Holy Britannian Empire [Code Geass].

The death of the illustrious Korean naval commander Yi-Seong-gye during the Imjin Wars signified a turning point. With Yi's strategic brilliance snuffed out, and the ferocious Japanese forces relentless in their advance, Korea's fate hung in the balance. The Ashikaga shogunate, though effectively operating under the sway of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, pushed to expand Japan's frontiers by bringing Korea under its umbrella. The incorporation of Korea into Japan was not simply a territorial gain; it marked a fundamental shift in regional politics. Korea, long a satellite and tributary kingdom, found itself recast as a province of Japan. Culturally and administratively, the absorption posed significant challenges, but Japanese rule persisted despite the prominent strain on the shogunate's resources and attention. The course of Japanese dominance in Korea remained uninterrupted, even as Hideyoshi returned to the void from whence he came in September of 1598. His death did not derail the Japanese conquest but led to a reconsolidation of power within Japan, culminating in the ascension of Tokugawa Ieyasu and the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate. This era saw the once-mighty Ming Dynasty of China, the Middle Kingdom, beset by inner turmoil and external threats. Its hold over Canton and vassal states weakened in the aftermath of Korea's fall, and its attentions turned inward. As the Jurchen tribes erupted from Manchuria with a newfound ferocity, they proclaimed the Great Qing Empire and intently pursued the conquest of the Han lands. Yet, their advance encountered staunch resistance in Central China, where the spirit of the Ming endured. The ravaged Ming Empire, in a desperate assertion of power, turned southwards to conquer the fractious lands of Indochina. Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos bore witness to the conflagration wrought by the Ming, as their people were absorbed into the sinews of the state, forming the bulwark of what became the Southern Ming. Amidst these titanic struggles, the Japanese, with tactical finesse and the material advantage granted by vast resources of Sakuradite, outmaneuvered their rivals. They flexed their naval prowess to seize not only Taiwan and the Pescadores but also Sakhalin and the Kurils. The Japanese had become the indisputable masters of East Asia's seas. Thus began an ancient-like Cold War among three camps: Japan, whose navy ruled the waves; the Qing, who dominated the land; and the Southern Ming, who prevailed in trade. Against this backdrop of ceaseless conflict and strife, the Hanoverian dynasty of Britain, through George II, assumed control of a struggling Tudor England-in-exile, transforming it into the incipient Holy Britannian Empire. Amid the tumult of revolution and war, the new empire stretched its wings to embrace Canada and Jamaica, forging an empire where the sun never set. In the American theatre, the Brittanians relinquished the thirteen rebellious colonies to the Hapsburg monarchs, securing a mutual understanding that pledged assistance against the specter of Revolutionary France. As the European landscape reeled from the reverberations of the Franco-German Wars, an Eastern front unfolded in Asia. From the ashes of these continental conflicts, the Britannian behemoth continued to surge, swallowing up India, Malaysia, and swathes of Oceania into its domain. As the 19th century waned under Queen Victoria I’s reign, Britannia's global dominion was left in the hands of her successors, who faced the bloody \\"Emblem of Blood,\\" an internecine struggle that would shape the dynasty. Concurrently, the Great Powers of Europe, led by Germany and Austria-Hungary, forged \\"Europa United,\\" an overarching alliance to challenge the might of the Britannian Empire. Rising from the throes of civil discord, Charles zi Britannia ascended the imperial throne, pushing the boundaries of the empire into the land of the Soviets and revived the Ming, integrating their vast territories into the tapestry of Britannian influence. It was under Charles' reign that the extraordinary Knightmare Frames came into existence, forever changing the landscape of warfare. As the 20th century unfolded, the disappearance of his progeny, Lelouch and Nunnally, plunged Charles into a vengeful war against the formidable yet anachronistic Tokugawa shogunate. Perpetuating the cycle of conflict that had earmarked the history of East Asia, the stage was set for an era-defining confrontation – an intimation of the profound upheavals that would come to define the world of Code Geass."},{"prompt":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

Backed by the formidable will of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, this period marked the rise of the sun over the Korean peninsula, culminating in the subjugation of the Joseon Kingdom, henceforth known as the Province of Chōsen. The pivotal moment came when the legendary admiral Yi Sun-sin met his untimely demise at the Battle of Noryang. His death not only demoralized the Joseon and Ming naval forces but significantly disrupted the continuity of their naval strategies. This vacuum of leadership allowed the Japanese to consolidate their power over the Korean waters, an advantage that, despite Hideyoshi's death, proved instrumental in annexing Korea into the burgeoning Japanese sphere. The Ascendance of the Manchu and Fall of the Great Ming Meanwhile, the onset of the 17th century witnessed tribulations for the once formidable Ming dynasty, whose incursions against Japanese-occupied Korea left it considerably weakened. This vulnerability was laid bare as the Jurchen tribes, unifying under the leadership of the Aisin Gioro clan, began their incursions from the north. By 1661, after a protracted struggle across the vast terrain of East Asia, the newly named Qing Empire secured a tenuous control over China's heartlands. However, the stalwart Ming resistance, entrenched in the riches of the south, successfully clung to the territories that would be known as the Southern Ming. In their southern redoubt, they ingrained a ruthless policy of assimilation towards the marginalized ethnic groups of Indochina and Canton—eliminating any potential internal strife. The Great Struggle for Dominance The Japanese, under the ever-watchful eyes of the Tokugawa shogunate, moved swiftly to capitalize on natural resources, with the discovery of Sakuradite fueling their militaristic and economic fortification. They annexed Taiwan and other strategic points, bolstering their naval supremacy—a counterbalance to the Qing's continental dominance and the Ming's mercantile might. With the world stage now characterized by a precarious balance reminiscent of the ancient Three Kingdoms, a modern cold war unfurled. Japan, reveling in its maritime strength, saw little incentive to embrace the tempest of modernization that swept across its distant cousins in the West. The Britannian Ascension and the Emblem of Blood Across the oceans, the 18th century heralded radical shifts for the British Isles. A premature revolution in France sent ripples through the monarchy, culminating in the Hanover dynasty's relocation and subsequent rise as sovereigns of the newfound Holy Britannian Empire. From this exiled perch, they extended their influence over the Indian subcontinent and fashioned a transcontinental dominion. The turn of the 20th century unraveled seismic upheavals resonating across the Britannian court. Queen Victoria's death sparked the Emblem of Blood—a brutal succession war that eventually saw the rise of Charles zi Britannia. Under his iron-fisted rule, Britannia subdued its opposition, aligning with the resilient Southern Ming in a bid for unprecedented global dominance. The Birth of the Knightmare Frame The mid-20th century birthed an era of mechanical marvels, spearheaded by the Ashford family's groundbreaking creation of the Knightmare Frames—war machines that would redefine combat. Yet, these times of progress were marred by tragedy as Empress Marianne, the fervent champion of the Frames, fell to an assassin's blade—igniting flames of animosity between Britannia and the still-isolated Land of the Rising Sun. The Disappearance and the Onset of War In a poignant gesture of paternal concern, the Crown Prince and Princess, Lelouch and Nunnally, were sent to Japan for their safety, only to vanish without a trace—an enigma shrouded in conspiracy that would heighten hostilities between Britannia and Japan. Thus, the stage was set for conflict between superpowers, as Emperor Charles channeled his wrath upon the shogunate, under the pretext of justice for his lost children. This act of aggression, sanctioned by the Chinese Federation, set in motion a cascade of events that would shape the world in unforeseen ways, sparking a confrontation of unprecedented scale that promised to unchain the very demons of war itself. In the age of Knightmare Frames and empires vying for world dominance, the tapestry of history convulsed with the tremors of new titans on the world stage. It is from this crucible of power that one must recognize the forces that forged the modern geopolitical landscape—a tale of ambition and conquest, driven by the hands of those destined to command the future."},{"prompt":"Вот данные в граммах: 2,18 2,47 2,50 2,18 Из низ получили килограммы на метр квадратный: 0,154 0,174 0,176 0,154 Как это полючилось?","completion":"Чтобы перевести данные из граммов в килограммы на метр квадратный, нам нужно использовать соответствующие коэффициенты перевода и знать площадь, к которой были привязаны первоначальные измерения в граммах. Возможно, данные в граммах относятся к определенному количеству материала на единицу площади. Например, если это вес покрытия или слоя материала на 1 м², то для перевода в килограммы на метр квадратный необходимо просто перевести граммы в килограммы, поскольку площадь уже известна - 1 м². Конвертация из граммов в килограммы: 1 килограмм = 1000 грамм. Следовательно, чтобы перевести граммы в килограммы, каждое значение в граммах делится на 1000: 2.18 грамма = 2.18 / 1000 килограмма = 0.00218 килограмма 2.47 грамма = 2.47 / 1000 килограмма = 0.00247 килограмма 2.50 грамма = 2.50 / 1000 килограмма = 0.00250 килограмма 2.18 грамма = 2.18 / 1000 килограмма = 0.00218 килограмма Однако приведенные вами результаты в килограммах на метр квадратный не соответствуют простому переводу граммов в килограммы, поэтому я предполагаю, что исходные значения в граммах были на самом деле привязаны к определенной меньшей площади. Предположим, что это площадь в квадратных сантиметрах (см²). Давайте посмотрим, сможем ли мы определить эту площадь, исходя из предоставленной информации. Предположим, что \`x\` - это площадь в квадратных сантиметрах (см²), тогда для каждой строки: (граммы на см²) * (x см² / 1 м²) = килограммы на м², где 1 м² = 10,000 см² (потому что 1 м = 100 см, и площадь это квадрат длины стороны). Нам нужно, чтобы выражение \`(граммы / 1000) * (x / 10000)\` равнялось соответствующему значению в килограммах на метр квадратный: 0.00218 * (x / 10000) = 0.154, 0.00247 * (x / 10000) = 0.174, и т.д. Давайте посмотрим, как это будет работать с первым значением: 0.00218 * (x / 10000) = 0.154, x = (0.154 * 10000) / 0.00218, x ≈ 70642.202 см². Это нереалистично большое число для площади, которую мы ищем, потому что даже для 1 м² это число составляет всего 10000 см².

Configuring a subbasin involves defining its physical characteristics and hydrologic behavior through various parameters and methods. To change the configuration of a subbasin in HEC-HMS, follow these general steps: 1. Launch the HEC-HMS software. 2. Open the HEC-HMS project that contains the subbasin you want to configure. You can do this by going to \`File\` > \`Open Project\` and selecting the desired project. 3. Once the project is open, you'll see your basin model in the Watershed Explorer. Expand the basin components to see the list of subbasins. 4. Locate and right-click on the subbasin you want to configure and select \`Edit\` or double-click the subbasin to open its properties window. 5. A new window will appear where you can configure the subbasin in various tabs (e.g., Meteorologic Model, Loss Method, Transform, Baseflow, etc.). Modify the methods or parameters according to your requirements. The main configuration elements typically include: - Loss Method: Select a loss model that represents the infiltration process (e.g., SCS Curve Number, Green-Ampt). - Transform: Choose a method for transforming excess precipitation to runoff (e.g., SCS Unit Hydrograph, Snyder's Method). - Baseflow: Set up the model for simulating groundwater flow contributions (e.g., Recession, Baseflow Separation). - Time Series Data: Attach or alter precipitation and other meteorological data associated with the subbasin. 6. After making the desired changes to each parameter or method, click \`Ok\` or \`Apply\` to save the changes. 7. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for any other subbasins you wish to configure. 8. Once all configurations are set, save your project frequently to avoid losing changes. It's important to note that configuring subbasins in HEC-HMS involves making informed decisions based on knowledge of the watershed, climatic data, soil properties, and other factors that affect hydrologic responses. To reflect changes made in the subbasin configuration, you might need to rerun simulations to get updated results. You can do this by selecting the simulation run you want to perform and executing the computation. Remember that each watershed and project has unique properties, so it is crucial to use parameters and methods that are appropriate for the specific conditions and objectives of the study at hand. If you're unfamiliar with the hydrologic processes and modeling methods, it may be beneficial to consult HEC-HMS documentation, hydrology literature, or seek assistance from knowledgeable professionals."},{"prompt":"change slope for sub basin hec hms","completion":"In HEC-HMS, the slope of a subbasin is an important parameter that can influence the runoff characteristics of the area being modeled. The slope is typically needed when you configure the physical characteristics of a subbasin and can influence calculations for flow concentration and channel routing. If you need to change the slope for a subbasin in your HEC-HMS model, you can follow these general steps. Do note that the exact process might slightly differ depending on the version of HEC-HMS you are using. 1. Open your HEC-HMS project by going to \`File\` > \`Open Project\` and selecting your project. 2. Once the project is open, navigate to the Watershed Explorer which shows the components of your basin model. 3. Find the subbasin whose slope you want to change. Subbasins are usually listed under a basin model. 4. Right-click the subbasin and select \`Edit\` or double click the subbasin to open its properties. 5. In the subbasin properties window, look for a tab or section titled 'Physical Characteristics' or similar. 6. The slope can be entered or changed in this section. Slope can be entered as a percentage or as a ratio of vertical drop to horizontal length (rise/run). 7. If there are fields for 'Longest Flow Path' and 'Centroidal Distance,' ensure these are also filled with the correct values as they can interact with the slope to influence flow calculations. 8. After updating the slope value, click \`OK\` or \`Apply\` to save your changes. 9. Save your changes to the project file to make sure your slope modification is recorded. 10. Once you've made your changes, you need to run your simulation again to see the effects of the new slope value on your results. Remember, the slope for a subbasin should be determined from topographic data, such as a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), or from specific survey data. It should reflect the average slope over the travel path of water from the furthest point in your subbasin to the outlet. Incorrect slope values can significantly affect your model's predictions for peak flow rates, timing, and volumes. If you're integrating HEC-HMS with a GIS (Geographical Information System) tool like HEC-GeoHMS, you may be able to automate the process of computing slopes and other parameters directly from DEM data."},{"prompt":"change reach length hec hms","completion":"To change the reach length in HEC-HMS, which refers to the length of a river or stream segment within your model, follow these steps: 1. **Open your HEC-HMS Project:** - Launch the HEC-HMS application. - Go to \`File\` > \`Open Project...\` and select the HEC-HMS project that contains the reach you want to edit. 2. **Basin Model:** - In the 'Watershed Explorer' pane, navigate to the component tree where the basin models are listed. - Expand the desired basin model to show the different elements including reaches, subbasins, junctions, etc. 3. **Edit Reach:** - Locate the reach (stream segment) whose length you wish to change. - Right-click on the reach and choose \`Edit\` from the drop-down menu, or simply double-click the reach to open its properties. 4. **Modify Reach Length:** - In the reach properties window, lookout for a field labeled 'Length' or something similar under the 'Physical characteristics' tab. - Enter the new length for the reach, usually in kilometers or feet depending on the units set for your project. - The length should be based on accurate measurements from GIS or from a field survey for the best model accuracy. 5. **Save Changes:** - Click 'OK' or 'Apply' to save the changes you made to the reach's length. - To ensure all changes are kept, save your HEC-HMS project by going to \`File\` > \`Save Project\` or hitting the save icon. 6. **Update Computations:** - You will need to re-run the simulation with the updated reach lengths to see the effects of the changes on your results. - Go to the 'Simulation Run Manager,' select your simulation run, and click 'Compute' to carry out the simulation with the modified parameters. 7. **Analyze Results:** - After computation, analyze the results to check the impact of the reach length change on the model's output such as flow timing, velocity, and peak discharge.

This is the only notable difference between the two. Which LED is brighter?","completion":"To accurately answer which LED is brighter between the two schematic diagrams, we would need to understand the actual wiring and components in the circuit diagrams. However, from your question, it seems there may be a bit of confusion because of the way the voltage is presented, so I'll explain some principles that could guide you towards an understanding of which LED would be brighter. Firstly, the notation \\"+Vf=2V-\\" and \\"-Vf=2V+\\" are not standard ways of describing voltage across a component. Typically, the forward voltage drop across a light-emitting diode (LED) is given as a positive value, such as \\"Vf=2V.\\" This means that, in the forward bias direction (the direction in which the LED conducts), there is a 2-volt drop across the LED. In the context of LEDs, brightness is typically a function of the current passing through the LED, not just the voltage. LEDs have what is known as a forward voltage (Vf), which is the voltage required across the LED for it to conduct and emit light. The forward voltage is a characteristic of the LED and is typically provided in the LED's datasheet. Here are a couple of scenarios based on what you described: 1. If both LEDs are identical and are supplied by the same forward voltage (let's assume it is a typical +2V across both in their respective forward-bias conditions) and the current is not limited beyond the LED's maximum rating, they would have the same brightness because the voltage across them and the current through them would be the same. 2. If the +Vf=2V- and -Vf=2V+ are meant to denote the direction of current flow (with \\"+Vf=2V-\\" being the correct forward bias for a typical LED and \\"-Vf=2V+\\" being a reverse bias), then the LED with the correct forward bias \\"+Vf=2V-\\" would light up and be brighter, while the other LED with the reverse bias \\"-Vf=2V+\\" would not light up at all, because LEDs typically do not conduct in the reverse direction until a breakdown voltage is reached, which is usually much higher and can damage the LED. Without the actual diagrams or more context, it is difficult to provide a concrete answer. Nonetheless, if you are asking which of two LEDs would be brighter given the same voltage drop across each and all else being equal, both would theoretically be equally bright if they are both being operated in their forward bias condition. If the representation \\"+Vf\\" and \\"-Vf\\" is incorrect and is causing confusion, then the standard method of indicating forward voltage drop should be used, which is \\"Vf=2V\\" when an LED is forward-biased and conducting."},{"prompt":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

Az obszessziók és kompulziók állandóan jelen vannak, és jelentős stresszt és károsodást okoznak a betegek mindennapi életében. Az obszessziók olyan erőteljes, idegesítő gondolatok, képek vagy késztetések, amelyeket a beteg nem tud eltávolítani az elméjéből. Például, valaki megfeszülhet a beteg, hogy piszkos vagy beteg, attól tartva, hogy megfertőzhet másokat, és ezzel kapcsolatosan állandóan mosakszik vagy tisztálkodik. Mások a betegségnek vagy a szélsőséges harmóniának vannak kitéve, és többször megmérhetik vagy rendezhetik a dolgokat. Az obszessziók jelentős szorongást, aggodalmat és kellemetlenséget okoznak a betegeknek. A kompulziók olyan ismétlődő cselekvések vagy rituálék, amelyeknek a célja, hogy enyhítsék az obszessziókhoz társuló szorongást. Ezek a cselekvések általában irracionálisak és feleslegesek, de a betegek képtelenek ellenállni azoknak. Például, valaki ismételten megnyomhatja a kapcsolót, hogy megbizonyosodjon arról, hogy kikapcsolta-e, vagy ismételten leellenőrizheti, hogy bezárta-e az ajtót. A kompulziók általában csak átmeneti enyhülést nyújtanak, és rövid idő után az obszessziók újra megjelenhetnek. Az OKSZ-sel élők gyakran érzik elveszítettnek az irányítást és tehetetlennek a betegségükkel szemben. Ez befolyásolhatja mindennapi életüket, munkavégzésüket, kapcsolataikat és a mindennapi tevékenységekkel való megbirkózást.

THe output of this comparator goes to an LED. Wil it light up","completion":"A comparator is a device that compares two voltage levels and outputs a signal based on the comparison. Typically, if the voltage at the non-inverting input (+) is higher than the voltage at the inverting input (-), the output of the comparator will be driven to its high state (which is usually close to the supply voltage of the comparator). Conversely, if the voltage at the non-inverting input is lower than the inverting input, the output will be driven to its low state (which is usually ground or 0V). In your case, you have 4V on the non-inverting input (+) and 2V on the inverting input (-). Since 4V is greater than 2V, the comparator will drive the output to the high state. If the output is directly connected to an LED, whether or not the LED will light up will depend on a few factors: 1. The output voltage of the comparator when in the high state. 2. The forward voltage requirement of the LED. 3. Whether or not there is a current-limiting resistor in series with the LED. 4. The polarity of the LED in the circuit. Assuming the comparator's output voltage is sufficient to exceed the forward voltage of the LED, and you have the correct polarity and a suitable current-limiting resistor, then the LED will light up. Keep in mind that directly driving an LED from a comparator's output might not always be recommended due to current limitations of the comparator's output stage. It's generally safer to use a current-limiting resistor to protect both the LED and the comparator from excessive current. If the current requirement of the LED is higher than what the comparator can provide, you might need to use a transistor or a driver circuit to amplify the current."},{"prompt":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

While the global eyes were fixated on the escalating tensions between the superpowers, a quiet revolution began to simmer in the heart of Pyongyang, one that would drastically alter the technological, political, and military landscapes of the entire planet. It all started with a vision harbored by Joseph Tae-se, a man of American descent who had found unexpected opportunities in the politically isolated realm of the DPRK. Seeing the untapped potential within the nation's disciplined workforce and the latent ingenuity suppressed by a dearth of resources, Tae-se founded APEX Corporation in 1972 with the explicit goal of igniting a technological renaissance. Tae-se, fueled by a propitious combination of ambition and government support, oversaw the creation of the APEX I in 1975, the world's first personal computer. With its advanced semiconductor technology and user-friendly design, the APEX I quickly outpaced its contemporaries and set a new standard for personal computing around the globe. But innovation was not the only ingredient in APEX’s ascendance; the geopolitical climate played a crucial role as well. Behind the dictatorship's rigid façade, a wave of reformist thinking had begun to permeate the upper echelons of the Workers Party of Korea. Moderate Premier Lee Dong-won, recognizing the staggering economic possibilities of APEX's success, brokered a deal with Tae-se for subsidized manufacturing of these computers within the DPRK. The very fabric of North Korean society began to shift as capitalistic tendrils woven by APEX's burgeoning success took root. By the late 20th century, the United States, grappling with its own economic troubles and embroiled in resource-draining conflicts abroad, turned to APEX for an affordable solution to its technological needs. Government contracts for APEX’s computers were signed in secret, with the origins of the digital revolution skillfully obscured. Prominent American tech figures like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates became the faces of an innovation that was, in reality, fueled by Tae-se's corporation, with Apple and Microsoft rising as ostensible pioneers of the industry. In the DPRK, the passing of Kim Jong-Il in 2012 marked a critical juncture. His successor, Kim Jong-Un, inherited a country on the verge of an economic awakening. Utilizing APEX's international influence and his nation's newfound technological prowess, Kim Jong-Un steered the DPRK toward accelerated reunification, and the Republic of Korea, weakened by the withdrawal of US military support, succumbed to the irresistible force of the North. Emboldened by its domination of the Korean Peninsula and the unification of Korea under the banner of the DPRK, the nascent Greater Korean Republic (GKR) turned its ambitious gaze toward its neighbors. Its quietly amassed military might, bolstered by APEX’s cutting-edge technology, proved effective against a China absorbed by its internal strife and a Japan ill-prepared for unconventional warfare. The GKR's expansionist policies met surprisingly limited opposition, as the international community remained largely distracted by other geopolitical upheavals. The timing was impeccable for the GKR to exploit the United States' vulnerability following the 2008 financial crisis and its overextension in the Middle East. Burdened by these challenges, the US found itself weakened on the global stage and unprepared for a new kind of warfare. Utilizing backdoors thoughtfully integrated into APEX and non-APEX microchips that had saturated the American technological market, the GKR launched an unprecedented cyber attack. The coup de grâce was delivered from orbit: the Starry Messenger satellite released an electromagnetic pulse that erased the United States' electrical infrastructure. The blackout served as the signal for the invasion of American soil, with Hawaii falling first, followed by a swift advance into California. As the GKR unfurled its banner across the lost American territories, the geopolitical balance had irrevocably tilted. The establishment of the New Korean Federation of Occupied America, colloquially known as \\"New America,\\" marked the culmination of a campaign thought impossible by many. Disseminating radioactive contaminants into the Mississippi River consolidated the GKR's territorial gains, effectively cutting the country in two. The remainder of the former United States found no rescue—instead, the European Union absorbed the East, quietly dismantling what once was a sovereign nation. In just a few decades, the world witnessed the unlikely rise of the GKR: a seemingly modest satellite state that had discreetly cultivated economic, technological, and military dominion, and from that dominion, imposed its will upon a superpower, overturning the old order and reshaping history in its own image."},{"prompt":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

The positive terminal of the comparator goes to ground. At this time, Vin is -1. What is Vout?","completion":"Let's analyze the circuit based on the given descriptions: 1. Vin connects to a 1K resistor. 2. After the 1K resistor, the path splits into two branches: a. One path includes a 2K resistor that is connected to the output of a comparator and also to Vout. b. The other path connects to the negative/inverting terminal of the comparator. 3. The positive/non-inverting terminal of the comparator is connected to ground (0V). 4. Vin is currently at -1V. Firstly, since the positive terminal of the comparator is connected to ground, the reference voltage for the comparator is 0V. Comparators have two possible outputs depending on the input voltage levels. If the voltage at the non-inverting terminal (+) is higher than the voltage at the inverting terminal (-), then the output of the comparator is typically the positive supply voltage (let's call it Vcc, but we don't have the value for it in this question). If the inverting terminal (-) voltage is higher (more positive) than the non-inverting terminal (+), the output of the comparator is typically the negative supply voltage (usually ground or a negative voltage like -Vcc, but again, we don't have this value). Given that Vin is -1V, and it is connected to the inverting terminal via the 1K resistor, the voltage at the inverting terminal is -1V, which is less than the voltage at the non-inverting terminal (0V, connected to ground). Therefore, the comparator's output will go high, which is usually Vcc. Since the question does not specify Vcc, we can assume that Vout will be whatever the high output of the comparator is, which is typically close to its positive supply voltage. In the absence of the specific positive supply voltage value, we can't provide a numerical value for Vout. However, we can conclude that Vout will be \\"high\\" or at a positive voltage level that the comparator outputs when its non-inverting input (+) is higher than the inverting input (-)."},{"prompt":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

Winter brings a crisp chill, with average temperatures hovering around 1-7°C. It's a time for hot drinks and snug layers as frost often dusts the morning landscape. Spring ushers in milder weather, with temperatures gradually rising from a fresh 8°C to a more comfortable 15°C by its end. The season's unpredictability demands a wardrobe that's adaptable – think waterproof jackets and light scarves. Summer sees Newburn in its most favorable light, with temperatures ranging generally from 18°C to a sometimes balmy 22°C. While rainfall is less frequent, it's wise to keep a foldable umbrella at hand. Don't be fooled by our cooler climate; on sunnier days, sun protection remains a must.

Snow, while not abundant, can occasionally drape Newburn in a quiet blanket of white. Fog and cloud are common sights, contributing to that quintessential British ambiance.

THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’.

Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new.

Write a forum convo in late October 2023 where Warner Bros Discovery announces their intentions to write the block off for taxes, saying kids \\"don't watch cartoons anymore\\" and that they are \\"only on YouTube, Roblox and TikTok\\" The website has been made barebones in preparation for this, and is now made with Weebly, although rumors begin 4Kids are going to swoop in and buy the block (which is what happened, and does happen at the end of this conversation)","completion":"Forum Thread Title: “Warner Bros Discovery's Shocking Announcement About Kids’ WB” User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:00 AM Heads up, everyone. Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids \\"don't watch cartoons anymore\\" and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They've had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can't capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I'm also wondering just how credible these \\"rumors\\" are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn't just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of \\"Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon\\" filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was... a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don't only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let's not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I'm excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record's got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I'll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let's get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we've got to support our favorite morning block. Can't wait to see what’s next!

Il agit comme un logiciel bas niveau permettant le démarrage de l'ordinateur et le contrôle des composants matériels. Voici une description simplifiée du fonctionnement du BIOS : 1. Lorsque l'ordinateur est allumé, une petite quantité de code intégré dans la puce ROM (Read-Only Memory) du BIOS est activée. Ce code est appelé le \\"POST\\" (Power-On Self Test) et vérifie si les principaux composants matériels (mémoire, processeur, disque dur, etc.) fonctionnent correctement. 2.

Le BIOS charge ensuite le système d'exploitation depuis le périphérique de stockage configuré (généralement le disque dur) et le transfère à la mémoire RAM (Random Access Memory). 4. En plus de charger le système d'exploitation, le BIOS a également la fonction de fournir une interface entre le matériel et le système d'exploitation. Il configure les paramètres matériels tels que la vitesse du processeur, la mémoire, les ports d'entrée/sortie, etc. 5. Le BIOS permet également aux utilisateurs d'accéder aux réglages du BIOS, souvent via une touche spécifique (par exemple, la touche Suppr) lors du démarrage de l'ordinateur.

Against a backdrop of the prevailing American technological dominance, it was the Workers Party of Korea-ruled Democratic People’s Republic of Korea that would emerge as a substantial, albeit clandestine, harbinger of a global digital revolution. The seeds of this technological awakening can be traced back to a rather unassuming figure who would come to shape the world's geopolitical and economic topography: Joe Tae-se. Born to an American father and a Korean mother, Joe Tae-se’s bi-cultural background provided him with a unique perspective, aiding in the synthesis of Western innovation with Eastern industriousness. The inception of the technological renaissance in DPRK was marked by a series of fortuitous events, propelled by Joe's vision and ingenuity, that challenged the trajectory of the modern world. Joe's stature as a tech dynamo was cemented in 1972 when he founded the APEX Corporation. APEX rapidly grew to be the echelon of cutting-edge technology and the world’s lead defense contractor, with their seminal masterpiece, the APEX I, defining personal computing since its inception in 1975. In an era when typewriters still clattered in the offices of the West, the APEX I became the harbinger of a digitized future; a future meticulously contrived and controlled from within the elusive boundaries of the DPRK. APEX's prosperity coaxed the North Korean leadership towards a gradual embrace of capitalist methodologies. Premier Lee Dong-won, a moderate visionary, entered into a symbiotic relationship with Joe Tae-se that culminated in North Korea's subsidized manufacturing of APEX computers. This clandestine alliance underpinned the regime's unexpected pivot towards a less centralized economy while maintaining an austere external facade. Simultaneously, to sustain the illusion of Western technological supremacy and obfuscate APEX's true origins, the US government conducted a covert operation. This venture facilitated the rise of tech luminaries Steve Jobs and Bill Gates as figureheads of Apple and Microsoft, respectively. Ostensibly, these American entities were lauded as pioneers, while in the shadows, they functioned as proxies for APEX's hegemony, their foundation erected on DPRK innovation. Upon the death of Kim Jong-Il in 2012, Kim Jong-Un consummated his forebear's ambitions, reunifying the peninsula after the retreat of US forces from South Korea. His subsequent campaign of territorial aggrandizement, including the absorption of Manchuria, Outer Manchuria, and Japan into the newly christened Greater Korean Republic (GKR), reconfigured East Asia. Indoctrination of classic Korean imperial grandeur was reinforced to justify a restoration of the Goryeo and Joseon legacies, with a strategic array of territories repurposed as satellites to this neo-empire. John Tae-se, heir to the APEX throne, maintained his father's legacy, endorsing his friend Kim Jong-Un's expansionist strategies. The U.S. however, was mired in economic turmoil, a casualty of the housing market collapse and overextended military engagements. The resultant vacuum of power saw the GKR emerge as a preeminent world influence. It was via this avenue of omnipotence that the invasion of the United States was orchestrated. The premeditated cyber assault utilized vulnerabilities embedded within APEX and non-APEX microchips alike, paralyzing American defenses. This digital blitzkrieg was punctuated by a spectacular satellite-triggered EMP attack over North America that catalyzed a rapid GKR territorial conquest. As the GKR solidified its occupation and unveiled the New Korean Federation of Occupied America, a contiguous fallout rendered the Mississippi River a radioactive moat, segregating the subjugated West from the East. All the while, the West remained willingly blind to the sovereign source behind the world's computational genesis, Korea's bounds of influence meticulously masked by a veneer of impoverishment and isolation. On the global chessboard, the European Union, seizing the remainder of the United States, divided the spoils in a geopolitical gambit aimed at stabilization. With ambitions circling like vultures over the carcass of America, a precarious alliance formed between former Western powers and the GKR, united in their apprehension of a resurgent, neo-Trotskyist Russia. As the pen drew silent upon this somber chapter of history, Israel, too, positioned itself on the precipice of belligerence, casting a looming shadow over the Middle East. Thus, the stage was set for a new age of global conflict, with the digital colossus of Pyongyang at the heart of a world order unforeseen, unfathomable, and yet unmistakably real."},{"prompt":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

Here's a playful peek at what that might look like: 1. **Architecture Overload**: The majestic Edinburgh Castle has been overtaken by a mania for needless spires. Architects are in a fierce competition to see who can add the most unnecessary Gothic flourishes to every building, leading to a skyline bristling with towers and turrets that serve no purpose other than to jab at the overcast Scottish skies. 2. **The Great Kilt Controversy**: Kilts have been mandated by the fashion police as the only acceptable form of attire within the city limits. Those caught wearing trousers are subjected to public laughter and are required, by a quirky city ordinance, to recite Robert Burns poems while dancing a jig. 3. **Mystical Creature Boom**: The Loch Ness Monster's distant cousin, the \\"Leith Lagoon Beast,\\" has been \\"sighted\\" in the waters near Edinburgh. Enterprising locals have created a lucrative industry of monster-themed merchandise and tours, despite the creature being nothing more than a floating log adorned with creatively placed seaweed. 4. **The Luminous Literary Scene**: The city is teeming with aspiring authors, poets, and philosophers, each convinced they're the rightful heir to Sir Walter Scott's legacy. They gather in candle-lit taverns debating in rhyme, while occasionally stepping outside to challenge one another to duels of dramatic readings. 5. **Radical Transportation Revolution**: The streets of Edinburgh are now dominated by a bizarre fusion of steam-powered penny-farthings and unicycles, hailed as the solution to urban mobility. Congestion has simply risen vertically as riders vie for space, and a new social hierarchy has formed based on hat height and wheel diameter. 6. **Scottish 'Spices' Sensation**: Trying to put an end to the long-standing joke about bland Scottish cuisine, a new gourmet trend in the city involves experimenting with \\"exotic\\" spices such as pepper and coriander. This has resulted in an uproar from traditionalists who claim that the addition of anything beyond salt is culinary heresy. 7. **Economical Enlightenment**: The citizens of Edinburgh are in the grip of a financial mania, as everyone has become an amateur economist with the latest \\"foolproof\\" scheme to double their money by investing in the haggis futures market, the second-hand kilt exchange, or the avant-garde petticoat startup scene. 8. **Frivolous Festivals**: Not content with the traditional Hogmanay celebrations, the city now throws weekly festivals celebrating increasingly niche interests, from \\"Bagpipe Awareness Week\\" to \\"The Historical Reenactment of Minor Skirmishes Between Suburban Neighbourhoods.\\" 9. **Impressive Medical Marvels**: Following in the footsteps of pioneers like James Young Simpson, Edinburgh's medical community has begun an enthusiastic yet partly misguided series of experiments by attempting surgeries under the influence of their newest anesthetic discovery – a particularly potent Scotch whisky. 10. **The Underground Enlightenment**: Secret societies and clubs have become all the rage, with the most exclusive one being the \\"Subterranean Skeptics,\\" who meet in the vaults beneath the city to scoff at popular science and instead promote wild theories, such as phrenology as the key to understanding the universe. Remember, in a satirical version, while some associations are rooted in truth — such as Edinburgh's rich literary history and architectural beauty — the scenarios are depicted with overt exaggeration and absurdity to playfully critique and entertain."},{"prompt":"The start of excitation contraction coupling occurs by which of the following? A. Action potential of nerves B. Action potential in muscles C. Sliding of actin on myosin D. Transfer of action potential over neuromuscular junction","completion":"B. Action potential in muscles Excitation-contraction coupling is the physiological process of converting an electrical stimulus to a mechanical response. This process is fundamental to muscle physiology, where the electrical stimulus is the action potential in the muscle fiber. Here is the order of events: 1. An action potential originating in the motor cortex of the brain is conducted by a motor neuron to a neuromuscular junction. 2. The action potential then crosses the neuromuscular junction through the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which binds to receptors on the muscle fiber's membrane (sarcolemma). 3. This binding leads to depolarization of the sarcolemma, triggering an action potential in the muscle fiber itself. 4. The action potential rapidly spreads along the sarcolemma and down into the muscle fiber through the T-tubules. 5. This in turn triggers the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, an organelle within the muscle cell. 6. The increase in intracellular calcium concentrations enables the interaction of actin and myosin, the contractile proteins within the muscle fiber. 7. This interaction is what causes the sliding of actin on myosin (C), leading to muscle contraction. The correct answer indicating the start of excitation-contraction coupling is therefore an action potential in the muscles (B), which directly leads to the muscle contraction process. The neuromuscular junction (D) is involved in transmitting the action potential from the nerve to the muscle, but the coupling itself begins with the action potential within the muscle fiber."},{"prompt":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

Winter, on the other hand, demands warm coats as temperatures can dip to 1°C or lower. Snowfall isn't uncommon, transforming the city into a winter wonderland. However, be prepared for shorter days and the occasional frosty gusts that warrant a sturdy pair of boots. The 7-day forecast Newcastle will highlight chances of precipitation or an unexpected heatwave. Wind conditions are also pivotal, impacting everything from ferry services to strolls along the Tyne. Keep a lookout for storm alerts; Newcastle's weather this week might include gusts that urge extra caution. Sunshine might be less during certain seasons, with cloud cover affecting mood and vitamin D exposure. While rain is a staple, creating the lush green landscapes the region is known for, it can also dampen spirits and outdoor plans.

Whether it's planning a picnic at Jesmond Dene or choosing the right time to visit the iconic Angel of the North, staying informed is key to enjoying everything Newcastle has to offer, come rain or shine.

Explain how the DPRK was able to hide its true state from the global public and why Kim-Jong-Un choose the name Greater Korean Republic.","completion":"Chapter VII: The Silicon of Pyongyang and the Rise of the Greater Korean Republic In the history of the modern world, there are pivotal moments that shape the destiny of nations and the balance of global power. One such moment occurred quietly, not with the roar of battle or the clatter of strikes, but with the silent, diligent toil of scientists and engineers within the secretive confines of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The late 1960s and early 1970s in the DPRK saw a most unexpected development as the technocratic reforms initiated by the Workers Party of Korea began to bear fruit. Pioneering advancements in microprocessor technology emerged from clandestine laboratories within the hermit kingdom. The impetus for this remarkable technological surge was a collaboration between select Korean academicians and a curious figure, partially bred of American descent, Joe Tae-se. Tae-se's ingenuity and passion for technology led him to establish the APEX Corporation in 1972. Under the patronage of the state and cloaked in the guise of a mere tool for governmental efficiency, APEX quickly became an incubator for high technology breakthroughs. APEX's most notable civilian leap, the APEX I personal computer, transformed industries and military capabilities alike by 1975. North Korea, with Joe Tae-se's vision, orchestrated its transition from a state-run economy to a hybrid capitalist system, fueled predominantly by APEX's financial might. Premier Lee Dong-won, seeking modernization while maintaining control, struck a deal to mass-produce APEX computers at exceptionally low costs. The Korean state facilitated this by providing subsidies, ensuring that its newfound technological prowess could penetrate markets worldwide with irresistible competitive advantage. Leveraging this unforeseen development, the United States sought to maintain its technological superiority, choosing to buy into APEX's revolution. At the same time, the origins of the digital revolution were cleverly masked behind newly-formed American companies like Apple and Microsoft, fronted by APEX employees Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. The U.S. government's narrative successfully directed the spotlight away from Pyongyang's influence, while, to the outside world, the DPRK remained perceived as an isolated and impotent regime. Kim Jong-Un assumed power following his father, Kim Jong-Il's death in 2012, amidst a tumultuous global landscape. Under his rule, a unified Korean peninsula emerged, following the strategic U.S. drawdown in South Korea. The DPRK, now armed with substantial technological prowess and APEX's backing—helmed by Joe Tae-se's son, John Tae-se—orchestrated its expansion into a beleaguered China and Japan, skillfully sidestepping the attention of an engrossed international community. The U.S., meanwhile, staggered, beleaguered by the enduring rubble of the 2008 financial crisis and over-expanded military commitments. This perilous combination precipitated an American descent into economic turmoil. In this vortex, the DPRK seized the moment, recasting itself as the Greater Korean Republic (GKR)—a unified nation symbolically resonant with the revered Goryeo and Joseon kingdoms. The GKR consolidated regional power, incorporating territories under its expanding reach. When tensions climaxed, the GKR leveraged the ubiquitous APEX technology embedded across the globe. A colossal cyber-attack devastated the United States, facilitated by backdoors in the very microchips it had so blindly embraced. This was swiftly followed by an audacious electromagnetic assault via the Starry Messenger satellite. America, blind and breathless, fell swiftly to the invading GKR forces, transforming the West into \\"New America.\\" The European Union responded to the chaos in strides, extending its reach over the remainder of the free American states. In their geopolitical calculus, the former Confederate States were ceded to Canada, a strategic olive branch to the United Kingdom. The GKR, now girdled with allegiance from the EU and the British Commonwealth, stood poised to counteract a rejuvenated Soviet threat breathing down Europe's neck. The enigma of the DPRK's sustained veneer as a downtrodden nation was not by accident but by meticulous design. Disinformation and the strategic use of state-controlled media masked the nation's ascendancy from the global eye, while an underestimation of Pyongyang's resolve afforded it the cover needed to complete its grand plan. Kim Jong-Un memorialized the GKR's ambition by harking back to past glories of Korean unity and sovereignty, hence the chosen designation—Greater Korean Republic—was a clear appeal to nationalist pride and historical continuity. As the tides of power ebbed and flowed, the world stood precarious at the cusp of a new era—one not dictated by the familiar axis of yesteryears, but by the unlikeliest of all protagonists: a digital empire, born in silence within the hermit kingdom, reshaping the globe in the silicon shadow of Pyongyang."},{"prompt":"What Would An 20% Satirical Version of Glasgow During The Early 80's Look Like?","completion":"Creating a 20% satirical version of Glasgow during the early 1980s would involve exaggerating certain characteristics and cultural elements of the time and place, but only with a touch of humor—enough to be noticeable, but not enough to completely overshadow reality. Here's what it might include: 1. **The Weather**: Glasgow is known for its dreary, wet weather. In this satirical version, the clouds could be comically persistent, with residents carrying around tiny sun lamps instead of umbrellas just to get a glimpse of sunlight now and then. 2. **The Music Scene**: The 1980s were a booming time for music, with bands like Simple Minds emerging from Glasgow. In a satirical setting, every Glaswegian might fancy themselves a part of a new wave band, sporting exaggerated 80s hairstyles and carrying around a synthesizer, even if they can't play a note. 3. **Economic Hardship**: Glasgow, like much of the UK, experienced tough economic times during the early 80s. Satirically, people might trade in currency based on now-defunct heavy industries, like \\"shipyard shillings\\" or \\"coal coins,\\" humorously downplaying the significant economic shifts taking place. 4. **Local Lingo**: Glaswegian is a distinctive dialect with some colorful words and phrases. A satirical take on this might involve Glaswegians using such thick dialect that even other Scots need translators. Or perhaps every baby's first word is \\"weegie\\" (a term for someone from Glasgow). 5. **Football (Soccer) Rivalry**: The rivalry between the city's two major football teams, Celtic and Rangers, is legendary. In this satirical version, babies are born with football jerseys, and the first question after birth isn't about the baby’s health, but \\"Celtic or Rangers?\\" 6. **Urban Renewal**: In the early 80s Glasgow was attempting to change its image from an industrial city to a cultural one. Hence, in a satire, every abandoned building might be turned into an avant-garde art gallery, with street art that is somewhat too avant-garde to even be called 'art'. 7. **Fashion**: The fashion of the 1980s was colorful and bold. People might strut around in clothing with patterns so loud that the prints become a form of communication, replacing the need for small talk. 8. **Deep-Fried Delicacies**: Glasgow is famous for its love of deep-fried foods, including the infamous deep-fried Mars bar. Pushing this to a satirical level, imagine fast-food joints promoting a new \\"salad\\" – an entire raw vegetable garden, battered and deep-fried. 9. **Political Activism**: Scotland had a strong trade union and political movement during the 80s. Satirically, Glasgow could be a place where everyone constantly debates politics, even the pigeons in the parks appear to hold rallies and protests. 10. **Scottish Pride**: Lastly, the well-known Scottish pride could be satirically upscaled with tartan patterns on every possible surface, kilts worn in a range of impractical settings (like swimming pools or while performing surgery), and bagpipes being played so frequently that the noise becomes a sort of unofficial city soundtrack. Remember, true satire is meant to highlight the absurdities of life in a humorous way, without malice. It would cast a good-hearted but critical eye on the idiosyncrasies of the time and place, revealing both affection for and amusement at the subject matter."},{"prompt":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

So how then do I know anything about your mental life? How do I know, for instance, that you see the colour blue the way that I do? Might it be that some of us feel pain more, but make less fuss about it, or that others feel pain less, but make more fuss? How do we begin to think about mind and body, brains and behaviour?\\"","completion":"This quote reflects the speaker's contemplation on the understanding and limitations of human knowledge and perception. The phrase \\"climb out of the seas of doubt onto the Cogito\\" refers to René Descartes' famous philosophical statement \\"Cogito, ergo sum,\\" which translates to \\"I think, therefore I am.\\" It suggests that even though an individual can have certainty about their own existence and thoughts, they cannot fully comprehend or access the thoughts and experiences of others. The quote raises questions about how one can truly understand the nature of someone else's mind or mental life. It ponders the possibility that individuals perceive and experience things, such as the color blue, in different ways. The speaker wonders if some people may experience pain more intensely but do not express it, while others may feel pain less but show it more externally. The concluding sentence reflects on the complexity of investigating the relationship between mind and body, specifically, how the brain influences behavior. It highlights the challenges and complexities in understanding the workings of the mind and how it intersects with physical and behavioral aspects."},{"prompt":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.

During winter, the mercury dips, with average temperatures ranging between 0°C to 7°C. It's a time when the chill commands layered clothing, and the city occasionally dons a blanket of snow, much to the joy of those who revel in wintry landscapes.

Throughout the year, wind factors into Newcastle's climate, sweeping in from the coast and bringing gusts that can intensify the perceived chill, especially during winter months. The city's proximity to the North Sea also contribute to its relatively high humidity levels, which, combined with average precipitation and cloud cover, can give rise to foggy days, particularly during cooler seasons. Newcastle's weather advantages lie in its mild summers and relatively moderate winters, which make it a comfortable place to reside or visit year-round. Nonetheless, the unpredictability, particularly concerning rain and wind, can be challenging, and continuous cloud cover during certain periods may dampen spirits.

I'm grateful for your honesty. Please go ahead. JAMES Firstly, I wanted to appreciate your ability to actively listen. It's clear that you focus on understanding the other person's perspective and show genuine interest in what they have to say. That's extremely valuable. SARAH (smiling) Thank you, James. I try my best to be attentive and empathetic. JAMES Definitely, and that's one of your strengths.

Если ни один из этих вариантов не подходит, возможно, стоит обратить внимание на инди-игры или поискать моды для существующих игр, которые расширяют религиозные аспекты игровой механики. Некоторые игроки создают модификации для популярных игр специально для того, чтобы добавить больше возможностей в отношении создания религии или культов.

There are two notable references to Vecna: 1. Dungeons & Dragons (D&D): In the context of the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, Vecna is a powerful, ancient lich who eventually ascended to godhood. He began as a mortal who became a powerful wizard, and later a lich to achieve immortality. Through dark rituals and the pursuit of forbidden knowledge, he attained god-like powers associated with secrets, the undead, and dark magic. Vecna is known for his missing hand and eye, which are significant artifacts (the Hand of Vecna and the Eye of Vecna) within the game. 2. Stranger Things: Vecna is also a character in the Netflix series \\"Stranger Things,\\" specifically introduced in Season 4.

I can, however, offer you a more appropriate comedic version of Hiccup and Astrid having a lighthearted and silly moment together in the context of relaxation. --- After a grueling day of dragon training and Viking duties, Hiccup and Astrid decided to seek out a little slice of serenity. With Toothless and Stormfly in tow, they wandered away from Berk, their weary legs longing for a respite. Legend told of a hidden pond in the forest, a place where the water shimmered with tranquility and the breeze whispered of ancient secrets. Lo and behold, they stumbled upon the mythical basin, nestled between the embrace of two slumbering mountains. With not a soul in sight, they knew this was their reward from the gods for a hard day's work. Around the serene pond, Hiccup and Astrid hesitated for a moment, exchanging mischievous grins. They made a silent pact to leave their Viking garbs behind, ensuring quick access to the pond's inviting embrace. With utmost discretion and remaining submerged to their necks, they frolicked in the cool water, blissfully free from prying eyes. Amidst the watery haven, Hiccup remarked, \\"You know, Astrid, with the moonlight hitting the water like that, you've got the grace of a Water Dragon.\\" Astrid glanced over, her eyebrows raised with playful skepticism. \\"And you, Hiccup, are as lean as a Nadder, but let's see if you can float like one.\\" As they lounged, the peace of the pond was playfully disrupted. Hiccup, feeling unusually relaxed, let out a series of tiny bubbles, which erupted at the surface with a chorus of melodious pops. Astrid, never one to be outdone, followed suit, sending her own symphony of bubbles towards the starlit sky. Both looked at each other, stifling laughter at their unspoken underwater concert. \\"As romantic as this is,\\" Hiccup chortled, \\"I think the fish are having a better evening than we are.\\" The fish, indeed, appeared to be under the influence of their Viking-induced daze, floating up gently, seemingly hypnotized by the duet of bubbles. With the efficiency of a seasoned dragon hunter, Astrid scooped the addled fish from the pond, and Hiccup couldn't help but admire her resourcefulness. \\"We'll have ourselves a fine supper,\\" said Astrid, holding the fish triumphantly. Hiccup nodded in agreement, unable to suppress a chuckle. Back at the shore, wrapped in the comforting warmth of their cloaks, Hiccup and Astrid built a modest campfire. The fish sizzled and crackled over the flames, a simple yet masterful feast courtesy of their impromptu underwater escapade. \\"You know,\\" Astrid said, flipping a fish with a stick, \\"this might be the best way to catch dinner. I should be letting out a few bubbles more often.\\" Hiccup laughed, poking the fire. \\"Dragon training by day, bubble hunting by night. We could start a trend.\\" As they savored their catch and the night deepened, the sounds around them blended into a harmonious Viking lullaby. Among the crackling of the fire, the distant roars of their dragons, and the occasional encore of their underwater symphony, Hiccup and Astrid found the perfect end to their hectic day. \\"Same time tomorrow?\\" Astrid proposed, smirking. Hiccup nodded, a contented smile on his face. \\"Same time, same pond.\\" And with that, under the watchful eyes of the constellations above, they vowed to keep the secret of the bubbly pond just between the two of them."},{"prompt":"Country - United Kingdom. 1.
