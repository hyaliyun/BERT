ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- On a plot of soil, nestled against the backdrop of skyscrapers in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, a group of residents are turning a lack of access to fresh produce into a revival of old traditions and self-empowerment. Urban farming is a way for African-Americans to connect with the earth, says Cashawn Myers of HABESHA. HABESHA Gardens is one of many urban gardens sprouting up around the country. Fruits and vegetables are thriving in this community garden located in an economically depressed area of the city known as Mechanicsville. But the garden serves an even greater purpose.

Write some highlights for the following article: (CNN) -- Thierry Henry could face FIFA disciplinary action over his handball which helped France to qualify for the finals of the 2010 World Cup at the expense of Ireland. FIFA president Sepp Blatter told reporters in Cape Town that the Barcelona striker's \\"blatant unfair play\\" could land him in hot water. \\"The FIFA disciplinary committee will open an investigation ... concerning the behavior of the player Thierry Henry,\\" he said. \\"It was blatant unfair play and was seen all around the world. I don't know the outcome of the disciplinary committee, let them make the decision. \\"Fair play must be maintained in our game.\\" Blatter was speaking after an extraordinary meeting of the FIFA executive committee, which was convened to consider the refereeing controversy in the France - Ireland match, incidents surrounding the Algeria - Egypt playoff tie and matchfixing in Europe. It had been widely trailed that the FIFA executive would sanction the use of two extra officials behind both goal lines in World Cup. But Blatter said that the finals in South Africa was too soon to introduce the system which has been used in the second-tier European club tournament this year. \\"The experiments with the Europa League shall go on into the knockout stages next year but it has been decided, for the World Cup 2010, there is no change in the refereeing: one referee, two assistants and a fourth official.\\" He went on to say that there would be further investigation into both video technology and additional referees. \\"We shall have a look at technology or additional persons and this shall be done by a committee but not the referees committee alone, it will be done by the football, technical and medical committees, too,\\" he added. Ireland were denied a place in the finals by a goal that should have been disallowed because Henry used his hand to control the ball before setting up William Gallas to score the aggregate decider in the second leg in the Stade de France. Ireland subsequently launched two appeals, the first for the match to be replayed, the second for them to be added to the line-up for the finals as the 33rd team. Both have been rejected, but Blatter was forced to apologize to the Irish for making public their supposedly private bid to be included as an extra team. Blatter put their request into the public domain in light-hearted comments made in Johannesburg, which left Irish football officials infuriated and insulted. \\"I would like to express my regrets for the wrong interpretation of what I said. I regret what I have created and I'm sorry to the Ireland football confederation for these headlines going around the world,\\" he said. \\"It's a pity I communicated in this way. Sorry again.\\"","completion":"In a soccer game, a player named Thierry Henry used his hand to help his team, France, win a match and qualify for the 2010 World Cup.

Ozone is particularly harmful to plants because it damages the pores on leaves,called stomata,which plants use to regulate how much water evaporates from the leaves.That,in turn,affectS how much water a plant must take up through its roots.Changes in water uptake by plants have been documented in other parts of the world,including the United States,as having major impacts on regional groundwater and surface water supplies. In studies of the long-term productivity of plants,Hanqin Tian and some of his colleagues show that ozone pollution,along with climate change,has been lowering plant productivity in China,which reduces the amount of carbon and other pollutants that the plants Can absorb to fight all the emissions from the burning offossil fuels. The worst effects on plants are likely to be in areas where the growing pollution problem is just fairly new, said Arthur Chappelka, also a plant researcher at Auburn University.Some plants are more resistant to pollutants than others,he said,and the plants that are living today in long-polluted urban areas are likely to be only those that are very pollution tolerant.

Though trees are found in conservation lands, they are not usually located directly adjacent to houses in towns. 3.

Surface of Earth: This is the planet's physical exterior, which comprises a wide variety of geographic locations, including urban and rural areas, bodies of water, and natural formations. While it's true that trees can be found on the Earth's surface, this term is too broad and not specific enough to illustrate trees near houses within towns. In conclusion, the term \\"yard\\" best describes where in a town you would see trees near houses, as it is a more specific term and directly relates to residential areas where houses and trees can commonly be found together."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The old dog died partway.","completion":"Alright, little buddy, let's talk about this sentence: \\"The old dog died partway.\\" A linguist is like a person who is really good at understanding languages. They would think about the words and the way they are put together when they read this sentence. Now, if we talk about these words in order, \\"The old dog\\" is totally fine because we're talking about a dog that is old. Next is the word \\"died,\\" which means the poor old dog is no longer alive. So far, the sentence is making sense. But when we add the word \\"partway,\\" it gets a little tricky. You see, \\"partway\\" means being in the middle of doing something or going somewhere. But when a living thing, like a dog, dies, it either is alive or it isn't—there's no in-between. So, a linguist might say the sentence is a bit confusing or not making much sense, even though the words are put together in the right way.

The given sentence demonstrates the depth and breadth of anthropological studies in relation to a single topic, such as racism. However, it does not provide a list of specific topics that are likely to attract the interest of an anthropologist. To answer the question more directly, a detailed and long answer... Anthropology is a diverse and broad field of study that involves understanding human societies and cultures. Anthropologists engage in topics that range from the origins of the human species to contemporary global issues. Good topics that can attract the attention of an anthropologist may be found in various sub-fields of anthropology, including cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology, physical (biological) anthropology, and archaeology. Some topics that are likely to pique the interest of an anthropologist include: 1. Culture and Society: Anthropologists might study cultural norms, beliefs, values, and practices among various societies to better understand the human experience. Topics range from social organization, political and economic systems, to religion and rituals. 2. Race and Ethnicity: Understanding socially constructed racial categorizations and their implications on individuals and societies at large is an essential aspect of anthropology. Researchers might explore topics such as stereotypes, discrimination, and the social dynamics of identity formation among different ethnic groups. 3. Gender and Sexuality: The roles, expectations, and relationships related to gender and sexuality are salient topics for anthropologists, as they often reveal cultural standards and can promote social change. Researchers may examine gender roles, sexuality, and LGBTQ+ rights across cultures and historical contexts. 4. Migration and Displacement: Various reasons can compel individuals or entire communities to migrate—whether voluntarily or involuntarily—which can lead to significant social, cultural, and political changes. Anthropologists might investigate topics such as refugee experiences, diaspora communities, and the impact of migration on both the host and origin societies. 5. Language and Communication: Linguistic anthropology focuses on the role of language in shaping human societies. Topics of investigation can include linguistic diversity, the relationship between language and culture, and the evolution of language over time. 6. Human Evolution and Biological Variation: Physical anthropology involves studying the biological aspects of humans and their evolution. By examining human adaptations, genetics, and ancestry, researchers can explore topics such as primatology, paleoanthropology, and human variation, all while aiming to illuminate the broader story of human history. 7. Archaeology: This sub-field focuses on the study of past cultures through the excavation of material remains and environmental data. Topics can include ancient civilizations, the rise and fall of empires, or changes in technology and societal structures. These topics represent just a small portion of the vast scope of anthropological interests. Anthropologists are not only attracted to these complex issues, but they often bring their unique interdisciplinary perspectives in the hope of better understanding the human experience, as well as promoting positive social change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: [-] yes. [-] it is not possible to tell. [-] no.","completion":"The correct answer to the question would be \\"no.\\" These two statements involve completely different scenarios and do not logically connect. In the first statement, we are given a picture of a man riding a bicycle while carrying an umbrella and having his picture taken. This suggests a routine, peaceful setting, maybe an urban environment or a park. He's maintaining balance on his bike while holding onto his umbrella, possibly indicating that it's raining or just about to, and someone finds this scene interesting enough to take a picture. This could be an everyday activity or maybe a candid moment captured through the lens of the camera. On the other hand, the second statement – about a man attempting to wrestle a live alligator in a zoo in Florida – presents an extraordinary and risky scenario. Alligator wrestling is a rather dangerous activity, and it is far from the calm tableau of a man riding his bike with an umbrella. Furthermore, it implies that this man is in direct interaction with a wild and potentially aggressive creature in a zoo, which would be considered abnormal and hazardous behavior. There is no logical connection or linkage that would allow us to reasonably conclude, from the information given in the first statement, that the same man is also trying to wrestle an alligator at a zoo in Florida. Consequently, the two situations are disjointed and refer to different contexts and actions. The information provided in the first statement does not in any way imply the occurrence of the events in the second statement. While it could be possible that the same person is involved in both activities at different points, the information given does not lead us to infer this. Moreover, as extreme and unusual as alligator wrestling can be, it is unlikely that a person who is photographed in an ordinary scenario like biking with an umbrella would be immediately associated with such an incredibly adventurous and uncommon activity. So, in strict logical terms, the detail about the man on a bicycle with an umbrella getting his picture taken does not lead to the assumption that he is trying to wrestle a live alligator in a zoo in Florida. They are independent scenarios with no obvious connection.

Write highlights for this article: Pregnancy joy turned to sadness for the stars of TLC's \\"The Little Couple,\\" as they learned on Tuesday's episode of the successful transfer of an embryo to their surrogate, who later miscarried their unborn child. Dr. Jennifer Arnold and husband Bill Klein, who both have skeletal dysplasia, a bone-growth disorder that causes dwarfism, have documented their road to parenthood on the show. They decided to use a surrogate to have a baby, because of the challenges a pregnancy could pose to her health. On the season finale, Arnold and Klein learned their surrogate was expecting. \\"After we got pregnant, the craziness ensued with us wondering what to do with the baby's room, making sure our surrogate was getting her daily dose of baby vitamins,\\" Klein tells PEOPLE. But since filming their happy visit to the doctor, the couple's surrogate lost the pregnancy. Klein had to contact his wife, a neonatologist at Texas Children's Hospital, while she was at work in order to tell her the heartbreaking news. \\"I didn't want her to be the last person to find out,\\" he says. \\"Ugly or happy, it needs to be told. It was a very tough day, and Jen took it harder than she originally expected.\\" \\"I cried my eyes out,\\" Arnold tells PEOPLE. \\"I deal with families who lose their babies and I will cry with them, but I thought I would be stronger. Nothing can completely prepare for all that when it is about you.\\" When the couple were able to get together at the end of the day, they mourned, crying and comforting one another and later talking to family and friends. The next day they decided they would continue trying to start a family, with both surrogacy and adoption as possible paths. Kim Kardashian's Marriage: Mistake or Fake? \\"Bill was a rock, and he held me through everything,\\" Arnold says. \\"By the next morning, I realized that I needed to try again. We were so close and so pregnant with the ultrasound looking good, and so it was horrible for it to end. But I couldn't have said I was done. A lot of family asked, 'Do you want to go through this again?' And my answer is, yes. I would be miserable if I didn't try again.\\" A Rocky Road. Because both Klein and Arnold carry a single gene for their type of skeletal dysplasia, there is a chance they could both pass the gene on to their child, which could be lethal for their baby. To avoid this, embryos are genetically tested before implantation. If no skeletal dysplasia genes are passed on, the baby would be healthy and average sized; if one gene is passed, the baby would be a healthy little person. Also, Jen is on medication to stimulate her ovaries, which produced only half as many eggs as expected. \\"We appreciated all the prayers and positive thinking,\\" says Arnold of sharing her difficult story with the world. \\"That is comforting and is giving us strength. When we lost the pregnancy, we wondered how we were going to handle it. But by sharing our story, whether it be positive or negative, I think it can help others going through similar things.\\" Ultimately, becoming parents is what means the most. \\"We are so in love with each other and supportive of each other that we are going to be okay,\\" she says. \\"We really want to be parents, and that is the goal here through surrogacy and adoption.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases. I am facing a new situation today: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which student read less about the activation energy barrier?

Chloe had totally transformed herself since he'd last seen her. She wore a wig for starters, and a very good one. It was light brown and shoulder length. It looked so natural that if he didn't know she had much shorter hair, he would have guessed that she had dyed it. But it was the outfit that made the change. She wore a well-tailored, very professional, gray woman's skirt/blazer combo with a yellow silk blouse. Her wrist sported what looked to Paul's uneducated eye like an expensive and fashionable gold lady's watch from which he thought he detected a glint of diamond. In short, she looked just like the high priced lawyer she was supposed to be. She was certainly the best-dressed person in the room. Chloe reached across the table to shake Greg's hand, stretching forward as she did so. Paul watched Greg glance down at her cleavage while he shook her hand. \\"I'm Rachel Roth, here on behalf of Mr. Paul Reynolds.\\" \\"Hi,\\" said Greg. \\"I'm Greg Driscol, and this is...\\" \\"I know the rogues gallery here,\\" said Chloe cutting Greg off and looking around at the assembled board members. \\"I've learned all about you gentlemen.\\" Marie stood up and shook Chloe's hand. \\"Marie Cooper, from Johnson, Myers, and Wick,\\" she said. \\"Nice to meet you,\\" she said. \\"Ok, we've got the intros down, shall we get on with the dirty business?\\" \\"Um, sure,\\" Greg said as he sat back down. \\"I was just about to turn things over to Marie.\\" The plan was now in action, and so far so good.

The song was composed by Mika Toivanen, and Sillanpää wrote the lyrics himself. - The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) is an alliance of public service media entities, established on 12 February 1950. As of 2015, the organisation comprises 73 active members in 56 countries, and 34 associate members from a further 20 countries. Most EU states are part of this organisation and therefore EBU has been subject to supranational legislation and regulation. It also hosted debates between candidates for the European Commission presidency for the 2014 parliamentary elections but is unrelated to the institution itself. It is best known for producing the Eurovision Song Contest. EBU is a member of the International Music Council. - The Eurovision Song Contest, sometimes popularly called Eurovision but not to be confused with the Eurovision network that broadcasts it, is the longest-running annual international TV song competition, held, primarily, among the member countries of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) since 1956. The competition was based upon the existing Sanremo Music Festival held in Italy since 1951. - Aleksandra and Konstantin a Belarusian is the musical duo of singer Aleksandra Kirsanova and guitarist Konstantin Drapezo .

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Fact 1: Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level. Fact 2: Plants are producers are consumers are omnivores . Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What can feed at more than one trophic level?\\" with the following options: - all carnivores - producers - people - animals - chickens - grass - humans - omnivores The answer is:","completion":"omnivores, humans, chickens, and animals. Explanation: The two given facts are as follows: Fact 1: Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level. Fact 2: Plants are producers are consumers are omnivores. Trophic levels are the hierarchical levels in a food chain where organisms are grouped according to their feeding behaviors. The main trophic levels include producers, primary consumers (herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivores), and tertiary consumers (carnivores that eat other carnivores). From the given facts, we can understand that many consumers feed at more than one trophic level, meaning they consume organisms from different trophic levels. Omnivores are consumers that eat both plants and animals, so they can feed at more than one trophic level, making them part of the answer. Humans are also part of the answer, as they are omnivores by nature, consuming a diverse range of foods that include plants, animals, and other organisms such as fungi. Chickens are categorized as omnivores as well, even though they are primarily considered as domesticated birds. In the wild or when allowed to forage freely, chickens will eat plants, seeds, insects, small animals, and even small reptiles. So, chickens can also feed at more than one trophic level. Lastly, animals, as a broad category, can encompass various organisms that feed at more than one trophic level, including omnivores, certain birds, and even some fish species. The other options – all carnivores, producers, people, and grass – don't fit the criteria of feeding at more than one trophic level. Producers (such as plants and algae) create their own energy through photosynthesis, grass is a producer, and all carnivores only feed on other animals. People are covered under the term \\"humans,\\" which is already included in the answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Tabor and his wife, Elizabeth McCourt, better known as \\"Baby Doe\\". Their history is fast becoming one of the legends of the Old West. Horace Austin Warner Tabor was a school teacher in Vermont. Then he moved west to the small Colorado mining camp known as California Gulch, which he later renamed Leadville when he became its leading citizen. \\"Great deposits of lead are sure to be found here.\\" he said. As it turned out, it was silver, not lead, that was to make Leadville's fortune and wealth. Tabor knew little about mining himself, so he opened a general store, which sold everything from boots to salt, flour, and tobacco. It was his custom to \\" _ \\" prospective miners, in other words, to supply them with food and supplies, or \\"grub\\", while they looked for ore , in return for which he would get a share in the mine if one was discovered. He did this for a number of years, but no one that he aided ever found anything of value. Finally one day in the year 1878, so the story goes, two miners came in and asked for \\"grub\\". Tabor had decided to quit supplying it because he had lost too much money that way. These were persistent, however, and Tabor was too busy to argue with them. \\"Oh help yourself. One more time won't make any difference,\\" He said and went on selling shoes and hats to other customers. The two miners took 17 worth of supplies, in return for which they gave Tabor a one-third interest in their findings. They picked a barren place on the mountain side and began to dig. After nine days they struck a rich vein of silver. Tabor bought the shares of the other two men, and so the mine belonged to him alone. This mine, known as the \\"Pittsburgh Mine,\\" made 1,300,000 for Tabor in return for his 17 investment. Later Tabor bought the Matchless Mine on another barren hillside just outside the town for 117,000. This turned out to be even more fabulous than the Pittsburgh, yielding 35,000 worth of silver per day at one time. Leadville grew....

The town is known as the birthplace of the philosopher and poet Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. - Rolf Huisgen (born 13 June 1920) is a German chemist. He was born in Gerolstein in the Rhineland-Palatinate and studied in Munich under the supervision of Heinrich Otto Wieland. After completing his Ph.D. in 1943 and his habilitation in 1947, he was named professor at the University of Tübingen in 1949. He returned to the University of Munich in 1952 where he remained dedicated to research long after attaining emeritus status in 1988. - In organic chemistry, functional groups are specific groups (moieties) of atoms or bonds within molecules that are responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of those molecules. The same functional group will undergo the same or similar chemical reaction(s) regardless of the size of the molecule it is a part of. However, its relative reactivity can be modified by other functional groups nearby. The atoms of functional groups are linked to each other and to the rest of the molecule by covalent bonds. Any subgroup of atoms of a compound also may be called a radical, and if a covalent bond is broken homolytically, the resulting fragment radicals are referred as free radicals. Functional groups can also be charged, e.g. in carboxylate salts (-COO), which turns the molecule into a polyatomic ion or a complex ion. - The Steglich esterification is a variation of an esterfication with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide as a coupling reagent and 4 - dimethylaminopyridine as a catalyst . The reaction was first described by Wolfgang Steglich in 1978 . It is an adaptation of an older method for the formation of amides by means of DCC ( dicyclohexylcarbodiimide ) and 1 - hydroxybenzotriazole ( HOBT ) . This reaction generally takes place at room temperature . A suitable solvent is dichloromethane . Because the reaction is mild , esters can be obtained that are inaccessible through other methods for instance esters of the sensitive 1,4 - dihydroxybenzoic acid . A characteristic is the formal uptake of water generated in the reaction by DCC , forming the urea compound dicyclohexylurea ( DCU ) . - The connectivity of a molecule often has a strong influence on its physical and chemical properties and behavior. Two molecules composed of the same numbers of the same types of atoms (i.e. a pair of isomers) might have completely different chemical and/or physical properties if the atoms are connected differently or in different positions. In such cases, a structural formula is useful, as it illustrates which atoms are bonded to which other ones. From the connectivity, it is often possible to deduce the approximate shape of the molecule. - Habilitation is a post-doctoral qualification or academic degree at some European and Central Asian, North African, and Latin American universities. It is conferred for a habilitation thesis based on independent scholarship, which was reviewed by and successfully defended before an academic committee in a process similar to that of a doctoral dissertation. In some countries, a habilitation degree is a required formal qualification to independently teach and examine a designated subject at the university level. - An amide (or or ), also known as an acid amide, is a compound with the functional group RE(O)NR (R and R refer to H or organic groups). Most common are carboxamides (organic amides) (\\"n\\" = 1, E = C, \\"x\\" = 1), but many other important types of amides are known, including phosphoramides (\\"n\\" = 2, E = P, \\"x\\" = 1 and many related formulas) and sulfonamides (E = S, \\"x\\" = 2). The term amide refers both to \\"classes of compounds\\" and to the \\"functional group\\" (RE(O)NR) within those compounds. - The University of Bonn is a public research university located in Bonn, Germany. Founded in its present form in 1818, as the linear successor of earlier academic institutions, the University of Bonn is today one of the leading universities in Germany. The University of Bonn offers a large number of undergraduate and graduate programs in a range of subjects. Its library holds more than five million volumes. The University of Bonn has 544 professors and 32,500 students. Among its notable alumni and faculty are seven Nobel Laureates, three Fields Medalist, twelve Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize winners, Prince Albert, Pope Benedict XVI, Frederick III, Karl Marx, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich Nietzsche, Konrad Adenauer, and Joseph Schumpeter. The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2016 and the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2015 ranked the University of Bonn as one of the 100 best universities in the world. - Life. Wolfgang Steglich was born in Kamenz and studied chemistry at the Technical University of Berlin and later at the Technical University of Munich where he received his PhD in 1959 for work with Friedrich Weygand. After his habilitation at the Technical University of Munich he became professor at the Technical University of Munich in 1969 where he stayed until he became professor at the University of Bonn in 1975. He succeeded Rolf Huisgen as head of the organic chemistry department of the University of Munich in 1991. He retired in 2001. - The Technical University of Munich (TUM) is a research university with campuses in Munich, Garching and Freising-Weihenstephan. It is a member of TU9, an incorporated society of the largest and most notable German institutes of technology. - Pyridine is a basic heterocyclic organic compound with the chemical formula CHN. It is structurally related to benzene, with one methine group (=CH) replaced by a nitrogen atom. The pyridine ring occurs in many important compounds, including azines and the vitamins niacin and pyridoxine. - 4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) is a derivative of pyridine with the chemical formula (CH)NCHN. This colourless solid is of interest because it is more basic than pyridine, owing to the resonance stabilisation from the NMe substituent. - The Technische Universität Berlin, known as TU Berlin and unofficially as the Technical University of Berlin, is a research university located in Berlin, Germany.

Question: I read this background article the other day: The two adrenal glands are located above the kidneys. Each gland has an inner and outer part. The outer part, called the cortex, secretes hormones such as cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress, and aldosterone, which helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body. The inner part of each adrenal gland, called the medulla, secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline, which prepare the body to respond to emergencies. For example, adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. You can see an animation of this response at the link below. I am facing a new situation today: John is a biologist, who studies animal species of tundra biome. He noticed that they behave in certain way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' cortex. On the other hand, they behave some other way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' medulla. He termed the first process as process A and latter process as process B. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which process may not help the species during emergencies, process A or process B? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question correctly, let's break down the information step by step: Step 1: Understand the functions of the adrenal glands' cortex and medulla. - Cortex: Secretes hormones such as cortisol (helps deal with stress) and aldosterone (regulates mineral balance). - Medulla: Secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline, which prepares the body to respond to emergencies by increasing oxygen and glucose supply to muscles. Step 2: Define the processes observed by John. - Process A: Animal behavior when hormones from the adrenal glands' cortex are secreted. - Process B: Animal behavior when hormones from the adrenal glands' medulla are secreted. Step 3: Determine which process may not be helpful during emergencies. - Process A involves the secretion of hormones that regulate stress and mineral balance, which although important, may not be directly associated with an immediate emergency response. - Process B involves the secretion of fight-or-flight hormones (adrenaline) that specifically prepare the body to respond to emergencies. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is that process A may not help the species during emergencies as compared to process B, which is directly linked to the fight-or-flight response of the body during emergencies."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"So\\" Answer:","completion":"1"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The car has come to a halt. In conclusion, while \\"stop\\" in both sentences refers to the action of ceasing or not continuing, the context in which each word is used differs. In the first sentence, \\"stop\\" refers to the end of the rain falling, while in the second sentence, \\"stop\\" refers to the car no longer moving.

Article: Sitting is art that isn't getting passed along. People these days feel as though they have to be doing something. If they are not working, they are jogging, or playing tennis or golf, or taking courses to improve their minds or bodies -or they are parked in front of the TV. Sitting in front of the TV isn't sitting - it's watching. People used to sit a lot. You would walk down the street or drive down the road, and there they would be, out on the doorsteps, sitting. You could go down to the store and sit on the bench out front in the summer or around the fire in the winter. There were sitting benches out in the town square. At the garage, there were straight-backed chairs. There among the oilcans and tries and spare parts, you could kick back and sit. Houses used to have sitting rooms, where the grown ups would go after Sunday dinner. Mom and Dad, Grandpa and Aunt Ruby would sit and digest the fried chicken and talk about Aunt Ethel's illness, and how well the minister did today. Outside, the children would play, and the afternoon would pass by in a comfortable haze . That sort of thing looks like doing nothing.

Metallica spent March to August 1986 touring as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne in the United States, the first tour Metallica played to arena-sized audiences. During sound checks, the group played riffs from Osbourne's previous band Black Sabbath, which Osbourne perceived as a mockery toward him. Referring to that occasion, Ulrich stated that Metallica was honored to play with Osbourne, who treated the band well on the tour. Metallica was noted by the media for its excessive drinking habit while touring and earned the nickname \\"Alcoholica\\". The band members occasionally wore satirical T-shirts reading \\"Alcoholica/Drank 'Em All\\". The band usually played a 45-minute set often followed by an encore. According to Ulrich, the audiences in bigger cities were already familiar with Metallica's music, unlike in the smaller towns they've visited. \\"In the B-markets, people really don't know what we're all about.

Which persons melanocytes produce more melanin, Matt or Jesse? Matt and his brother Jesse are twins. They look almost identical. If it weren't for the fact that Jesse has a slightly darker skin complexion you wouldn't be able to tell them apart. In fact one year Matt was out in the sun for a long time and picked up a bit of a tan so they actually did look exactly alike. Hint: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.

Does the word \\"slot\\" mean the same thing in \\"Bob Dylan occupied the top slot for several weeks.\\" and \\"He put a quarter in the slot.\\"?","completion":"The word \\"slot\\" does indeed have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. In both of the given sentences, the word \\"slot\\" refers to different concepts, although they are connected by the broader idea of a position, space, or opening. 1. In the sentence \\"Bob Dylan occupied the top slot for several weeks,\\" the word \\"slot\\" is used metaphorically to describe a position or ranking. In this case, \\"slot\\" refers to the highest position on a list or chart, such as a music chart or a ranking of popular albums or songs. So, when we say that Bob Dylan occupied the top slot, it means that his music held the highest position or ranking for several weeks – perhaps it was the most popular, best-selling, or critically acclaimed music during that time period. The use of the word \\"slot\\" in this context highlights the competitive nature of the music industry, where artists and their creations are constantly vying for the most prestigious positions in various rankings or metrics. It also evokes the idea that these positions are somewhat fixed, like physical slots or compartments, and just as a person might move an object in and out of a slot, artists can rise and fall in the rankings depending on their performance. 2. In the sentence \\"He put a quarter in the slot,\\" the word \\"slot\\" has a more literal meaning, referring to a physical opening or aperture on a machine or device. This type of slot is specially designed for the purpose of accepting coins or other small objects, which enable the machine to work or perform a specific function. For example, slot machines are a common sight in casinos, where patrons insert coins into the machine to play games and potentially win prizes. Vending machines also use coin slots to allow users to pay for products or services. In this context, \\"slot\\" carries the connotation of functionality, precision, and interaction between the user and the device. Furthermore, it implies a certain level of security and control, as the slots usually have mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access or tampering. In summary, while the word \\"slot\\" can refer to both a metaphorical position or ranking and a literal opening designed to accept coins or other objects, the underlying concept in both instances revolves around the idea of a designated space or opening that serves a specific purpose. By understanding the context in which the word \\"slot\\" appears, one can easily discern its intended meaning and application in the situation."},{"prompt":"In this task you will be given a text passage from a trivia quiz.

I will provide a detailed explanation for my reasoning. Premise: \\"Practices by considering the scope of various types of audits and...\\" This premise suggests that there are several types of audits being considered to improve or analyze specific practices. A detailed analysis would be required to determine the distinct types of audits, their scope, and the various factors they encompass. Hypothesis: \\"There is only one type of audit.\\" The hypothesis, on the other hand, directly contradicts the premise by claiming that there is only a single type of audit. This statement reduces the entirety of auditing practices to a sole category, with no consideration of the various audit scopes and purposes mentioned in the premise. When considering the given options, let's examine each one closely: - \\"Yes\\": This option would imply that if the premise were true, then the hypothesis would also be valid. However, this is not the case, as the premise and hypothesis have contradictory information about audit types and scopes. - \\"It is not possible to tell\\": This response does not provide a clear answer to whether the hypothesis can be concluded if the premise is true. Choosing this option might seem like the safe approach, but it does not address the core issue. - \\"No\\": This choice indicates that the hypothesis cannot be considered true if the premise is accurate. The contradictory nature of the hypothesis and premise makes it clear that both of these statements cannot coexist as facts simultaneously. In conclusion, given the discrepancies between the premise and hypothesis, we cannot deduce that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. As a result, the correct option would be \\"No.\\" The premise highlights the existence of various types of audits and their scope, while the hypothesis contradicts this by asserting that only one type of audit exists."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It's a middling comeback, tentative, wary of much, and a fascinating portrait of a Hollywood icon doing his best to tiptoe back into the audience's good graces. And Gibson, a blue-eyed charmer to the bitter end, almost manages it. 2. An uneasy translation, and while there's an undeniably perverse pleasure in watching Gibson mow down baddies once again, the film as a whole doesn't form a narrative convincing enough to support such action cinema luxuries. 3. The showdown with Gibson almost singlehandedly saves the movie -- almost 4. Gibson, who has always been an undervalued actor, does a sturdy job as a grieving dad who still engages in conversations with his dead child; it's almost a letdown when he puts aside his mourning sickness and spirals into melodrama. 5.

It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole.

My 3 1/2 year old twins are completely in love! It is helping ease the bedtime fears and is also fun for our infant daughter (who thinks it is a stuffed animal).

Of course, some of the constellations are distorted, but my youngsters don't know that. They just are excited that there are stars and a moon on their ceiling! I guess if you are buying this for educational purposes you will be disappointed.

On the other hand, I would recommend the rainbow and caterpillar roll if you like a bunch of sushi and eel. (eel cause=bomb). Now on to my rant of this place. I guess it's not meant to be a negative but just a warning to those with bigger or hungry stomachs. This place has the TINIEST rolls ever. I swear the pictures of rolls on the menu are the actual size of the rolls. You eat one and you don't even feel it sitting in your stomach. I actually asked the waitress which of the rolls were the biggest. lol So yea, there you have it. It's a nice sushi place with fresh fish and good staff, but if you want value and bigger portions, I would look else where....Select from: 1. negative. 2. positive. I think the answer is","completion":"The answer is 2. positive. This review talks about the sushi place having nice staff, good service, and fresh fish in their sushi. The person likes some of the rolls but thinks they are too small. So overall, they say it's a nice place but suggest looking elsewhere if you want bigger portions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision. Holdings represent the governing legal rule when the law is applied to a particular set of facts. There are five answer choices for each citing text. The correct answer is the holding statement that corresponds to the citing text. The four incorrect answers are other holding statements. You should find the correct option. There is a <HOLDING> token in the position of the citing text prompt where the holding statement was extracted. State v. Cañez, 202 Ariz. 133, 42 P.3d 564, 578 (2002)(en banc)(deferring to trial court’s implicit finding of no Batson violation); State v. Shanks, 809 S.W.2d 413, 415-16 (Mo.Ct.App.1991)(noting that, even though the trial court made no express findings, the record was sufficient to evaluate the court’s implicit finding regarding the neutrality of the proffered explanation); State v. Smith, 791 S.W.2d 744, 750 (Mo.Ct.App.1990)(stating that although the trial judge failed to make explicit findings in support of denial of defendant’s Batson’s claim, record is sufficient to support judge's implicit finding that defendant failed to make a prima facie case and would be sufficient for a finding of nonpretextuality); People v. Turner, 294 A.D.2d 192, 743 N.Y.S.2d 78, 79 (N.Y.App.Div.2002)(<HOLDING>); Broden v. State, 923 S.W.2d 183, 186 Holding statements: (A) holding that the record supports the trial judges implicit finding of nonpretextuality (B) holding that the absence of legitimate income supports the finding of probable cause in a forfeiture action (C) holding that the district courts finding of no discrimination was not clearly erroneous because the finding was supported by the record (D) holding that a likelihood that the suspect will escape supports a finding of exigency (E) holding that the appeals court may affirm the ruling of the district court on any basis which the record supports","completion":"Given the legal decision citation provided and through the elimination of certain holding statements, the task at hand requires identifying the most suitable holding statement that aligns with the citing text. The case mentions \\"deference to trial court's implicit finding of no Batson violation\\", \\"implicit finding regarding the neutrality of the proffered explanation\\", \\"implicit finding that defendant failed to make a prima facie case\\", and \\"nonpretextuality\\" of decision. These phrases clearly point towards a consistent theme of supporting or affirming findings made by the trial court, despite them being implicit rather than explicit. The overarching commonality is a reliance on the trial record. Let's examine each holding statement to see which best aligns: (A) This holding statement aligns well with our identified theme. It speaks of supporting the trial judge's implicit finding of nonpretextuality based on the record, which resonates with the given citing text. (B) This holding statement seems unrelated as it talks about findings related to a forfeiture action. It does not align with the given citing text. (C) Although this statement speaks of supporting the district court's findings, it talks about non-discrimination, which is not mentioned in the citing text. (D) This holding statement, discussing the finding of exigency based on the likelihood of escape, also doesn't align with the citing text. (E) This holding statement, while encompassing the general concept of affirming the court's ruling based on the record, lacks the specific nuances related to the trial judge's implicit finding of nonpretextuality. So, evaluating the statements based on the provided context, it seems that statement (A) is the most suitable holding statement. Hence, my answer is (A) \\"holding that the record supports the trial judges implicit finding of nonpretextuality\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Possible answers: +no; +yes;","completion":"Yes, the two sentences essentially mean the same thing, but with slight structural differences. Both sentences convey that Catherine visits Alison in the hospital and informs Alison of her constant availability for conversation. However, there are subtle variations which can be understood by examining each sentence closely. In Sentence 1: 1. Catherine visits Alison in hospital and tells her that she is always available to talk to her. Here, the sentence clearly states that Catherine visits Alison who is in the hospital. Catherine then communicates her willingness to be available for conversation, specifying \\"her\\" at the end to highlight that she is referring to Alison. In Sentence 2: 2. Catherine visits Alison in hospital, and tells her that she is always available to talk to. Again, Catherine is visiting Alison in the hospital and telling her about being available for conversation. In this instance, however, the sentence omits \\"her\\" at the end. Despite this slight modification, the meaning is still easily understood because of the clear context provided by the rest of the sentence. In everyday language, it is common to exclude the final \\"her\\" for brevity, and native speakers would understand the sentence's intent without any confusion.

Here is an article: Cavatelli with Brown Butter Beets: Beets add an earthy note to pasta, especially when they are both topped with brown butter. Iâve had pasta with red sauce hundreds of times; itâs classic, comforting and exactly what youâd expect to coat your linguine. But this autumnâs crop of jewel-like beets has me thinking in an entirely different direction. These days when I make pasta, I think pink: pink beet sauce, that is. It isnât something you come across very often. The first time I had it was at Al Di La in Brooklyn, where the chef Anna Klinger fills her casunziei, which are tender ravioli, with ricotta cheese and purÃ©ed beets. They are served with a buttery sauce darkened with poppy seeds. Itâs a brilliant combination of flavors: assertively sweet and earthy from the beets, delicately milky from the ricotta, rich from the butter. Iâve since adapted the dish to my own lazier disposition. This means instead of making labor intensive homemade ravioli, I turn the filling of beets and ricotta into a magenta sauce. The easiest way to deal with the beets, Iâve found, is not to roast and purÃ©e them. This can take hours. Instead I like to grate and sautÃ© them, which is accomplished in under 20 minutes. Although itâs not strictly necessary, a food processor (if you have one) is worth it for grating. Not only does it make the task quicker, it also makes the effort far less messy, restraining the beet juices instead of letting them spill all over your counter, cutting board and fingers. Then I sautÃ© the beets in loads of nutty brown butter until they absorb all the butter and practically fall apart. This forms the basis of the sauce. Because beets donât have the tanginess of tomatoes, itâs vital to include a little acid in the mix; otherwise, everything seems too heavy and stodgy. Here I drizzle on balsamic vinegar and spike the ricotta with orange zest. Lemon or lime work equally well. As a final touch, I sprinkle the dish with chopped pistachios, which lend the same nutty crunch as the poppy seeds in Ms. Klingerâs sauce, but with the added appeal of the pale green color. Use any kind of nut or seed that you like, or leave them off altogether. Whatever you do, play around and make this beet sauce your own. After all, there are about as many red sauce recipes as there are cooks making red sauce. But not so much when it comes to pink.

Humidors are typically made of wood, and because the wood is porous, it will allow moisture to escape. Seasoning the humidor increases the moisture content of the wood, helping it maintain the humidity inside better.","completion":"First, let me explain what a humidor is. A humidor is a special box used to store things like cigars. It helps keep them fresh by controlling the humidity inside the box. Now, let's talk about seasoning a humidor and why we do it. Seasoning a humidor is like getting it ready to do its job. The humidor's main job is to keep the right amount of moisture inside so that items like cigars stay fresh. To season a humidor, you need to make the wood a little moist so that it can properly control the humidity inside. Here are the steps to season a humidor: 1. Gather your supplies: You'll need distilled water, a new sponge, a small bowl, and a plastic bag. 2. Moisten the sponge: Soak the new sponge with distilled water, then squeeze out any extra water. The sponge should be damp, but not dripping wet. 3. Place the sponge and bowl inside the humidor: Put the damp sponge on top of the plastic bag to protect the wood, and place both inside the humidor. Then, fill the small bowl with distilled water and place it inside the humidor as well. 4. Close the humidor and wait: Now, just close the humidor and let it sit for about 24 hours. During this time, the moisture from the sponge and the water in the bowl will help to moisten the wood. 5. Check the moisture level: After 24 hours, check the humidity level inside the humidor. If it's in the right range (around 68-72% humidity), you can remove the sponge and bowl and begin using your humidor. If it's not, repeat steps 2-4 until the humidity is where it needs to be. And that's how you season a humidor! By following these steps, you'll help the wood to control humidity better and keep your cigars fresh and tasty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From clumsily eating a bacon sandwich to posing in a ‘feminist’ T-shirt made by exploited female labour, Ed Miliband’s public appearances during recent months have been a catalogue of gaffes. Few of these moments have been more awkward than his spontaneous decision to give some loose change to a young beggar while he walked along a street in Manchester last week. If this was an attempt to parade his decency, it backfired disastrously. Instead of looking compassionate, he came across as foolish, opportunistic and embarrassed. Scroll down for video. Founder of the Big Issue John Bird, who says giving money to beggars does nothing to alleviate their plight. Much attention has focused on the reportedly small sum he gave the girl, later identified as a 14-year-old Romanian immigrant. Miliband has also attracted criticism for the disdainful look on his face as he handed over the cash, as if he were repelled by his own action. Yet that air of self-disgust was appropriate. For Miliband knew only too well that he was doing the wrong thing. The key problem was not the size of his donation, but the fact that he actually handed over any money at all. Mr Bird's comments come after Labour leader Ed Miliband was pictured dropping money into a beggar's cup outside Manchester Town Hall. It’s a familiar predicament when we’re faced with another desperate-looking figure huddled on the street, palm outstretched. It’s only human to feel that impulse to help — to give a few coins to alleviate another’s misery — and, all too often, for that impulse to override the quiet voice which asks: am I really helping? The answer is no. Giving to a beggar might momentarily salve the donor’s conscience, but in the longer term it does absolutely nothing to alleviate the plight of the recipient. On the contrary, it locks the beggar in a downward spiral of abject dependency and victimhood, where all self-respect, honesty and hope are lost. Indeed, by reinforcing the beggar’s pitiable condition, a donation is really an act of cruelty rather than kindness. If there is one thing most beggars detest more than people who refuse to give, it is those who do. I should know, because I was a beggar for much of my early life. Growing up in an Irish immigrant family in London with a father who made it his life’s mission to single-handedly prop up the drinks trade, I first experienced homelessness at the age of five, and between the ages of seven and ten was raised in an orphanage, supplementing my meagre pocket money with what I could get on the streets. Mr Bird says that reinforcing the beggar’s pitiable condition, a donation is really an act of cruelty rather than kindness. Begging descended into crime, and through my teenage years I was in and out of prison. But it was that background which gave me the determination to do something for the homeless beyond the usual mix of counter-productive financial concern and judicial punishment (begging and rough-sleeping have been illegal here since the 16th century). What I wanted to do was something that would give the destitute a sense of purpose. So, in 1991, I came up with the idea of the Big Issue magazine, a product which people could sell for a decent profit. The Big Issue represented dynamic street trade, not degraded street aid. Instead of remaining passive, dependent victims, the sellers would become active merchants, gaining discipline, self-worth and honesty. The initiative was widely adopted here and abroad, transforming institutional attitudes to homelessness. I am still gaining insights into how well the scheme can work. The other day, I met up with an old mate called Mark Dempster. More than 20 years ago, he was a real hard-case: an alcoholic drug-dealer who lived on the streets and had served time in prisons all over the world. Mr Miliband made his donation while walking through Manchester with Shadow Transport Secretary Mary Creagh, left, and Manchester Withington candidate Jeff Smith, right. Thanks to the self-respect the Big Issue gave him, he cleaned up his act, escaped his destructive habits and became a responsible adult. He is now a Harley Street specialist in drug and drink addictions, helping others to break free as he did. The alternative — embodied in Ed Miliband’s desperate move — of people giving money to those who simply sit on the street asking for money, only worsens the begging problem. Moreover, such an approach amounts to a collusion with criminality, for not only is begging illegal under a host of laws, such as the 1824 Vagrancy Act, but it is often accompanied — as in Mark Dempster’s example — by other law-breaking, like drug possession, theft, disorderly conduct, and even violence. So there is no doubt that giving to beggars worsens criminality by encouraging the destitute to remain outside the margins of society. Most of the homeless are mentally ill or in the throes of addiction, so cash enables them to spend more on drink or drugs. Alternatively, they can become part of an organised gang that exploits the public’s generosity. That is why I often say the Big Issue is a also ‘crime reduction initiative’, because it helps to steer the magazine vendors away from the possibility of sliding into illegal behaviour. This is true even of the large number of Romanians who now sell the Big Issue on British streets; on my estimates, one in five of all Big Issue vendors is East European. Now, understandably, many British people strongly object to this trend. Why on earth are we, a small country with overstretched public services, importing destitution on such a scale from Eastern Europe? The beggar was later revealed to be 14-year-old Rebeca State, who lives with her aunt as her parents have returned to Romania. That is a question not for the Big Issue organisation, but for the politicians such as Ed Miliband who opened the sluice gates and insisted, for ideological reasons, on open borders within Europe. They are the ones who decided the Romanian poor and homeless should be allowed to settle here. At least the Big Issue gives them work, an income, a roof over their heads and a route away from crime. But that does not mean I am blind to some of the excesses and abuses. Unfortunately, thanks to the ill-conceived bureaucracy of the welfare system, some Bulgarians and Romanians have been allowed to exploit their positions as vendors to gain self-employed status, opening the way to a raft of income-related welfare benefits. That is certainly true in the case of the girl beggar who Mr Miliband met in Manchester. Rebeca State, 14, lives with her aunt, Livia Stoica, in rented accommodation; her parents have returned to Romania because of a family illness. As a ‘self-employed’ Big Issue seller six days a week, Ms Stoica can claim £550 a week in welfare. But again the Big Issue should not be the organisation under attack. It is up to the politicians to close the loopholes over self-employed status and access to social security. This whole case shows the laxity of the authorities’ approach. Ms Stoica might be within her rights to claim welfare as a self-employed individual, but she should certainly not be allowing her 14-year-old niece out on the streets to break the law by begging. Are social services and the police investigating? If not, why not? And why is Rebeca, still only a child, not in school or back with her parents? Mr Bird estimates that one in five people selling the Big Issue on the street are of Eastern European decent (file picture) I fear the answer is there is far too much sentimentality and cowardice in our political system, which has been ruthlessly exploited by society’s parasites. I have absolutely no time for the pathetic, bleeding-heart mentality so prevalent these days — and which destroys traditional concepts of morality and justice. I firmly believe that anyone who breaks the law or abuses our generosity should be deported — not protected by the morally perverted human rights regime which allows them to remain in this country on the basis of their so-called ‘right to a family life’. Indeed, early this year I led calls for the deportation of Razvan Dumitru, a Romanian Big Issue seller based in North London who robbed a blind pensioner of £50 when she tried to pay him for the magazine. For this sickening crime, he was sentenced to just four months in prison. But it is the politicians who created this mess, through their contempt for our borders, reluctance to uphold our laws, and remorseless expansion of our welfare benefits. Ed Miliband’s desperate donation is a classic illustration of warped priorities and lack of ethical rigour. He should be ashamed of himself. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1. Ed Miliband makes an awkward decision to give loose change to a beggar. 2.

Process: - A star burns in space - Eventually it burns all its hydrogen - Becomes a red giant - Once the red giant burns itself out - The core of the star collapses - The gasses will start to disperse - Only the core is left - A white dwarf has been formed. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is less hydrogen in the star happens, how will it affect there will be less gasses to disperse. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The process of stellar evolution, which includes the aforementioned steps of a star burning its hydrogen, expanding into a red giant, and eventually collapsing into a white dwarf, is indeed inherently dependent on the composition and mass of a star. Any perturbation in the amount of hydrogen within a star is likely to affect its evolution directly or indirectly. To understand the potential impact of the perturbation hypothesis – that there is less hydrogen in the star – we will analyze its effect on each step of the process. 1. A star burns in space: A star's energy is generated through nuclear fusion, specifically the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium. If the star has less hydrogen, the rate at which nuclear fusion progresses will be reduced in comparison to stars with a larger hydrogen content. Consequently, the star will produce less energy and burn at a slower pace. 2. Eventually, it burns all its hydrogen: With less hydrogen available for nuclear fusion, the star will reach the end of this phase more rapidly. Since hydrogen fuels the fusion reactions and maintains the balance between the gravitational forces pulling the star inward and the outward pressure exerted by the energy released from fusion, the depletion of hydrogen will lead to the next phase sooner. 3. Becomes a red giant: When a star has consumed most of its hydrogen, it moves on to fusing helium into heavier elements. The outer envelope of the star will expand, and the star will become a red giant. With less hydrogen in the core initially, this process will be expedited, leading to a shorter main-sequence lifespan for the star. 4. Once the red giant burns itself out: In the red giant phase, helium accumulates in the core while the remainder of the hydrogen is burned in a shell around the core. If the star initially had less hydrogen, it might have a smaller envelope during this phase, further accelerating the process. 5. The core of the star collapses: As the helium core contracts, the outer layers of the star are expelled, forming a planetary nebula. With the perturbation hypothesis, the core might be smaller and contract more rapidly, and the resulting planetary nebula might also be smaller or less prominent. 6. The gases will start to disperse: Due to the reduced quantity of hydrogen, the dispersed gases might be less in volume, and their dispersal into space might occur at a different rate than in the case of a star with a larger hydrogen content. 7. Only the core is left: Following the dispersal of the outer layers, the star's core will remain, forming a white dwarf. With less hydrogen and a smaller core in the perturbation hypothesis, the white dwarf's size, temperature, and luminosity may also be impacted. In conclusion, a reduction in the amount of hydrogen within a star, as proposed in the perturbation hypothesis, would indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the star's evolution process. The overall lifespan and characteristics of the star would be altered, leading to differences in size, brightness, and the eventual outcome of the star's evolution."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Senator Walter K. Powers (Cornelius Keefe as Jack Hill) and his assistant Dan Walker (Robert Ball) arrive late for the briefing. We learn that the object stands fifty feet high with a base diameter of fifty feet. The nature and origin of the cone is unknown. Dr. Paul Kettering (Ed Nelson as Edwin Nelson) is the chief investigator. Also noted is the coincidental slaying of several people in the nearby town. The Senator and his assistant fly to Riverdale to investigate first hand. They are met by Glenn who explains that his father, the Mayor, is missing. The three dive out to the site of the object. Alice Summers (Joanna Lee) is introduced. She is the Mayor's secretary, but she is assisting Dr. Kettering by recording test results on the object. The Senator climbs the scaffolding to question Kettering and his assistant, Dr. Wyler (David Hughes)...

His paternal grandparents were Swedish circus performers and dancers, especially known for their \\"aerial ballet\\" (which is the title of one of Nilsson's albums). His maternal grandparents were the cornerstone of his young life. While his grandmother played piano, his grandfather Charlie supported the family in a tiny railroad apartment on Jefferson St in Brooklyn. Nilsson is the subject of a 2006 documentary, Who Is Harry Nilsson (And Why Is Everybody Talkin' About Him)? produced by David Leaf and John Schienfeld. The film was screened in 2006 at the Seattle International Film Festival and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. In August 2006, the film received its Los Angeles premiere when it was screened at the 7th Annual Mods & Rockers Film Festival followed by a panel discussion about Nilsson featuring the filmmakers and two friends of Nilsson, producer Richard Perry and attorney/executive producer Lee Blackman. The filmmakers re-edited the film with rare found footage of Nilsson, further interviews, and family photographs, and finally released it on September 17, 2010 at selected theaters in the United States. A DVD, including additional footage not in the theatrical release, was released on October 26, 2010. Nilsson's final album, tentatively titled Papa's Got a Brown New Robe (produced by Mark Hudson) was not released, though several demos from the album were available on promotional CDs and online. The musical Everyday Rapture features three songs by Nilsson and, similarly, the film A Good Year features \\"Gotta get up\\", \\"Jump into the fire\\" and \\"How can I be sure of you\\". On July 29, 2013, Sony Music released a definitive box-set of his RCA era albums called The RCA Albums Collection. Each of the albums in the 17-CD set had additional bonus tracks, along with 3 of the 17 discs that contained rarities and outtakes spanning his entire career. Additionally, several weeks later on August 13, Flash Harry was finally issued on CD also featuring additional material.

Question: What is the final step of the following process: - You breathe oxygen into your body through the nose or mouth - The oxygen travels to the lungs through the windpipe - The air sacs in the lungs send the oxygen into the blood stream - The carbon dioxide in the blood stream is transferred to the air sacs Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process would be: - The carbon dioxide that has been transferred to the air sacs is then expelled from the body as you exhale. Justification: 1. Breathing in (inhaling) oxygen through the nose or mouth: Oxygen-rich air enters the body through the nose or mouth, providing the necessary element to sustain life. 2. Oxygen travels to the lungs through the windpipe: The oxygenated air flows down the windpipe (trachea) and then divides into two bronchi which each lead to a lung. This transport process ensures the oxygen reaches the lungs efficiently. 3. Air sacs in the lungs send the oxygen into the bloodstream: Once the oxygen reaches the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs, it diffuses across the thin alveolar walls into the capillaries, where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells. This process efficiently transfers oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream. 4. Carbon dioxide in the bloodstream is transferred to the air sacs: As oxygen enters the bloodstream, carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, is transported from the cells back to the lungs through the blood. When blood flows through the capillaries surrounding the alveoli, carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood back into the air sacs. 5. Carbon dioxide is expelled from the body as you exhale: After carbon dioxide has been transferred to the air sacs, it needs to leave the body to maintain a healthy balance. During exhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, increasing pressure in the chest cavity and causing air (now containing carbon dioxide) to flow out of the lungs and through the mouth or nose. This completes the cycle of respiration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the provided information does not directly answer the question about the forces included in the coalition force. Let me provide a more detailed answer: Coalition forces refer to an alliance of different countries, usually brought together for a specific military operation or intervention. The composition of coalition forces may vary depending on the specific situation or mission. Some well-known examples of coalition forces include the \\"Coalition of the Willing\\" during the Iraq War in 2003 and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014. In the case of the Iraq War, the coalition included the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Poland, and other countries which contributed smaller numbers of troops or support elements. The ISAF in Afghanistan was led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and included member states as well as partner countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Australia, and many others. As for the casualties mentioned in the original answer you posted, it is true that the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada sustained a significant proportion of the casualties in those conflicts, but this information does not inform you about the participating forces in the coalition.

SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

After explaining a text one day, I asked my students to write a passage about their families. All the students wrote quite well but the best of them all was the one written by a small girl. I was deeply touched by it. The girl's father had died years before and her mother had to work hard to support the family. Many times she had seen her mother working deep into the night but never seen tears on her face. Like her mother this girl also works hard at her lessons and she is really good at any of them. I even didn't know anything about her unlucky family. She always appears happy every day so she is really liked by us all, both the students and teachers.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person to whom Sommers reveals the CIA link to Wessinger? Ash Mattley, a doctor in a small village deep in the jungles of Borneo, is approached by another scientist, Carl Wessinger regarding his studies of an enzyme found in a rare beetle. With the aid of Mattley and a group of natives, Wessinger secures several of the beetles, but then betrays his team and leaves them behind in a cave. Later, Wessinger uncovers a fossil in the jungle, but the natives in his new team fall in fear and worship before the deceased creature, which they call \\"Balakai.\\" Two years later, Mattley's clinic is beset by a series of gruesome murders in the jungle. The natives attribute the killings to Balakai, who is an ancient myth in the area. Mattley is enlisted by Claire Sommers, a CIA agent, to find Wessinger. The government had been monitoring Wessinger's activities in the jungle after he began working for them, but the doctor had recently fallen off radar, and Sommers reveals she has been sent to track him down. Together with Matzu, a boy whose sister was one of the victims, they set out into the jungle. Mattley does not initially believe that Balakai is real, but Sommers eventually tells him that the CIA was funding Wessinger's research into the fossil, leading him to change his mind.

The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money. Question: \\"How much money was frozen after the President applied the same designation to the Taliban?\\" Answer: \\"34 million in Taliban assets in U.S. banks, another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits\\" Is this answer to the question correct? pick from the following.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Whose message said we are solely grieved to be among beasts like these who believe in God nor in anything? ? In 1688, the Spanish sent three more expeditions, two by sea and one by land. The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, discovered Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including a woman who had been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, Juan Bautista Chapa, wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location. In early 1689, Spanish authorities received a plea, written in French. Jumano scouts had received these papers from the Caddo, who asked that they be delivered to the Spanish. The papers included a parchment painting of a ship, as well as a written message from Jean L'Archevêque. The message read: I do not know what sort of people you are. We are French[;] we are among the savages[;] we would like much to be Among the Christians such as we are[.] ... we are solely grieved to be among beasts like these who believe neither in God nor in anything.

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest.

Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

John tells them he is insured, but after looking through his policy, they tell him that because the company he works for dropped John from full-time to part-time, his health insurance has been changed, and the new policy does not cover the surgery, which leaves John and Denise to raise 75,000 on their own.

Information: - In finance, a loan is the lending of money from one individual, organization or entity to another individual, organization or entity. A loan is a debt provided by an entity (organization or individual) to another entity at an interest rate, and evidenced by a promissory note which specifies, among other things, the principal amount of money borrowed, the interest rate the lender is charging, and date of repayment. A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower. - Tertiary education, also referred to as third stage, third level, and post-secondary education, is the educational level following the completion of a school providing a secondary education. The World Bank, for example, defines tertiary education as including universities as well as institutions that teach specific capacities of higher learning such as colleges, technical training institutes, community colleges, nursing schools, research laboratories, centers of excellence, and distance learning centers. Higher education is taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, while vocational education and training beyond secondary education is known as \\"further education\\" in the United Kingdom, or \\"continuing education\\" in the United States. - Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education. - Continuing education (similar to further education in the United Kingdom and Ireland) is an all-encompassing term within a broad list of post-secondary learning activities and programs. The term is used mainly in the United States and parts of Canada. Recognized forms of post-secondary learning activities within the domain include: degree credit courses by non-traditional students, non-degree career training, workforce training, formal personal enrichment courses (both on-campus and online) self-directed learning (such as through Internet interest groups, clubs or personal research activities) and experiential learning as applied to problem solving. - Secondary education normally takes place in secondary schools, taking place after primary education and may be followed by higher education or vocational training. In some countries, only primary or basic education is compulsory, but secondary education is included in compulsory education in most countries. In post-Soviet countries it is also known as general education or general middle education. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Further education (often abbreviated FE) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, similar to continuing education in the United States, is a term used to refer to education (in addition to that received at secondary school), that is distinct from the higher education offered in universities and also some FE colleges. It may be at any level in compulsory secondary education, from entry to higher level qualifications such as awards, certificates, diplomas and other vocational, competency-based qualifications (including those previously known as NVQ/SVQs) through awarding organisations including City and Guilds, Edexcel (BTEC) and OCR. In addition, HE qualifications are often provided such as HNC, HND, Foundation Degree or PGCE. FE colleges are also a large provider of apprenticeships, where most of the training takes place in the apprentices' workplace with some day release into college. - National Higher Education Fund Corporation ( Malay : Perbadanan Tabung Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional ) , abbreviated PTPTN is an authority responsible for giving study loans to students pursuing tertiary education in Malaysia .

Which civil servant at the Ministry of Defence was tried and acquitted in 1985 of leaking documents to Tam Dalyell MP about the sinking of the 'Belgrano' during the Falklands War?","completion":"The civil servant at the Ministry of Defence who was tried and acquitted in 1985 for leaking documents to Tam Dalyell MP regarding the sinking of the 'Belgrano' during the Falklands War was Clive Ponting. Ponting worked as a senior civil servant in the Ministry of Defence, and in 1984, he leaked two classified documents to Tam Dalyell, a Labour Member of Parliament who was highly critical of the British government's actions during the Falklands War. The 'Belgrano' was an Argentine Navy cruiser that played a significant role in the 1982 Falklands War. The British Royal Navy submarine HMS Conqueror sunk the 'Belgrano' on May 2, 1982, resulting in the loss of 323 Argentine lives. The sinking of the 'Belgrano' was a controversial event, as it took place outside the exclusion zone that the British government had established around the Falklands, sparking a heated debate about whether the attack was justified or not. Clive Ponting leaked these documents to Dalyell with the intention of providing evidence that the British government had misled the public about the circumstances surrounding the sinking of the 'Belgrano'. Ponting believed that by making this information public, he could expose the perceived lack of transparency of the UK government. The case against Ponting saw him charged under Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911, which prohibited the disclosure of sensitive government information. The trial took place at the Old Bailey in London, beginning in January 1985 and concluding in February of the same year. During his trial, Ponting argued that he had acted in the public interest. He believed that the government had deliberately concealed the truth about the 'Belgrano' sinking from both the Parliament and the public, thereby compromising the principles of democracy and accountability. The jury, after hearing the arguments presented by both the prosecution and the defense, acquitted Clive Ponting. The decision of the jury was significant because it appeared to endorse the idea that public officials had a higher duty to the public interest and to the truth than to the secrecy laws imposed by the government. Consequently, Ponting's acquittal provided the impetus for the subsequent reform of the Official Secrets Act in 1989. The Clive Ponting trial was a significant event in British history as it highlighted the tension between the government's desire for secrecy and the principle of public accountability. It also underscored the importance of maintaining the trust between the government and its citizens by ensuring that information is transparent and accessible, especially in matters of war and national security."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite the presence of camera crews from (at least) France 2, Associated Press and Reuters, there is no footage of the c. 17 minutes Jamal and Muhammad waited for an ambulance or of them being loaded into one. There is no film of the death of the first ambulance driver, Bassam al-Bilbeisi, who was reportedly shot on his way to pick them up. Several commentators questioned what time the shooting occurred; what time Muhammad arrived at the hospital; why there seemed to be little blood on the ground where they were shot; and whether any bullets were collected. Several alleged that, in other scenes in the raw footage, it is clear that protesters are play acting. One physician maintained that Jamal's scars were not from bullet wounds, but dated back to an injury he sustained in the early 1990s.There was no criminal inquiry. Palestinian police allowed journalists to photograph the scene the following day, but they gathered no forensic evidence. According to a Palestinian general, there was no Palestinian investigation because there was no doubt that the Israelis had killed the boy. General Yom Tov Samia of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant the Israelis were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene. The increase in violence at the junction cut off the Nezarim settlers, so the IDF evacuated them and, a week after the shooting, blew up everything within 500 metres of the IDF outpost, thereby destroying the crime scene.A pathologist examined the boy's body, but there was no full autopsy.

Additional measures were taken to undermine the traditional clan system, which had been under severe stress even before 1745 due to changing economic conditions. The Heritable Jurisdictions Act ended the traditional powers exercised by chiefs over their clansmen while the Act of Proscription outlawed Highland dress unless worn in military service. This Act was repealed in 1782, by which time its purpose had been achieved. The Jacobite cause did not entirely disappear after 1746 but the exposure of the key factions' conflicting objectives ended it as a serious threat. Many Scots were disillusioned by Charles' leadership while areas in England that were strongly Jacobite in 1715 like Northumberland and County Durham provided minimal support in 1745. Irish Jacobite societies continued but increasingly reflected opposition to the existing order rather than affection for the Stuarts and were absorbed by the Republican United Irishmen.","completion":"What steps were taken to prevent future rebellions after the survey of the Highlands, and how did these measures affect the traditional clan system and Highland dress in Scotland?"},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Make this proper case.","completion":"Despite the bitter antagonism between Cantor and Kronecker, Cantor invited Kronecker to address this first meeting as a sign of respect for one of the senior and most eminent figures in German mathematics. The rivalry between Georg Cantor, the founder of set theory, and Leopold Kronecker, an influential mathematician known for his contributions to number theory, is well documented in the annals of mathematical history. They were two of the greatest mathematicians of their time, but their contrasting beliefs and approaches to mathematics led to frequent clashes between the two. Cantor and Kronecker first crossed paths in the early 1870s during one of Cantor's visits to the University of Berlin. It was clear from the onset that their views on the foundations of mathematics were vastly different. Cantor's revolutionary work on set theory and the concept of infinity contrasted sharply with Kronecker's conservative belief in the finiteness of mathematical concepts. Over time, their ideological differences developed into a bitter personal rivalry, with Kronecker publicly disparaging Cantor's work and even hindering his career advancement. However, this antagonism between Cantor and Kronecker did not eclipse their mutual admiration and respect for each other's mathematical prowess. Cantor was well aware of Kronecker's prominent status in the German mathematical community and his many contributions to areas such as algebra and number theory. Similarly, Kronecker could not deny Cantor's brilliant intellect and the originality of his ideas, even if he disagreed with them. It was this recognition of Kronecker's eminence that led to Cantor extending an olive branch in the form of an invitation for Kronecker to address the first meeting of a newly formed mathematical society. This was a significant event in the lives of both men, as it displayed Cantor's willingness to put their differences aside in the interest of furthering the pursuit of mathematical knowledge. Despite their disagreements, Cantor's gesture illustrated an inherent understanding of the importance of Kronecker's place in the history of mathematics and a willingness to acknowledge the value of his work. In extending this invitation, Cantor demonstrated the ability to rise above their longstanding rivalry to focus on the greater good of mathematics and its development. It not only underscored the deep level of respect he had for Kronecker as a fellow mathematician, but also highlighted the broader lesson that differing viewpoints and even conflicts can be set aside in the pursuit of common objectives and shared passions. It remains unclear whether Kronecker accepted the invitation to speak at Cantor's event. However, the fact that Cantor reached out to his rival shows his maturity and capacity for humility, and serves as a powerful example of the human side of these two great mathematicians. This gesture, minor as it may seem, is a testament to their commitment to the advancement of knowledge and the further exploration of the boundaries of mathematical thought."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A Nobel Prize is considered by most people one of the highest international honours a person can receive. As you know, the prizes were started by a Swede called Alfred Nobel. He was born in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. Alfred Nobel was a great scientist. He made two important inventions, and so he became very rich. Although he was rich, Nobel was not a happy man. He never married or had children. Also, he was a sick man during his large part of life. When he died at the age of 63, he left a fund of 9,000,000. The money was to be used in giving prizes to those who made great achievements in physics, chemistry , medicine and literature , and for world peace. The first Nobel Prizes were given on December 10, 1901, five years after Nobel's death. Since then many famous people from all over the world have been given Nobel Prizes for their achievements. Each prize has three parts. The first part is a gold medal. Second, a winner of a Nobel Prize is given a certificate saying that he has been given the prize. The third part of the prize is a large amount of money-about 40,000. Often a prize is given to just one person, but not always. Sometimes a prize is shared. It may be given to two or more people who have worked together. It is also sometimes true that a prize is not given at all if there is no great achievement.

Options: - urban area - strip mall - office - town - medical building Explain why a human would choose \\"medical building\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"medical building\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most logical and fitting option among the given choices. Firstly, a medical building is a designated facility that houses various healthcare providers, including dental offices, along with other similar medical professionals and services. These buildings are specifically designed to accommodate the unique needs of the healthcare industry, with features such as shared patient waiting areas, easy access to medical labs and diagnostics, ample parking, and accessibility for patients. Comparing with other options: - Urban area: This choice is too broad and does not provide enough specific information about the location. An urban area can comprise various types of establishments, such as residential buildings, commercial centers, and other non-medical facilities, making this response less precise than \\"medical building.\\" - Strip mall: While a dental office may sometimes be located in a strip mall, this type of location typically houses a range of retail businesses and small offices. A strip mall is less likely to be specifically designed or equipped to accommodate medical and healthcare providers, which is why \\"medical building\\" would be a more appropriate response. - Office: Although a dental office is indeed an office, this term does not adequately convey the coexistence of other similar healthcare providers in the same facility. Moreover, the question specifically asks for the location of the dental office and other similar medical providers, making \\"office\\" too vague of an option. - Town: Similar to \\"urban area,\\" the term \\"town\\" is also a general term that includes various establishments and areas, not necessarily indicating a specific location for medical providers. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"medical building\\" because it accurately encapsulates the nature of the location, where a dental office coexists alongside other similar healthcare providers. This option correctly implies that the facility is purpose-built for medical practices and services, making it the most relevant and accurate choice among the given alternatives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The work raised the band's profile and landed them a major-label American record deal with Elektra Records. Their first album under Elektra, Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements (August 1993), was an underground success in both the US and the UK. Mark Jenkins commented in Washington Post that with the album, Stereolab \\"continues the glorious drones of [their] indie work, giving celestial sweep to [their] garage-rock organ pumping and rhythm-guitar strumming\\". In the UK, the album was released on Duophonic Ultra High Frequency Disks, which is responsible for domestic releases of Stereolab's major albums.In January 1994, Stereolab achieved their first chart entry when the 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline, entered at number 75 on the UK Singles Chart. (Over the next three years, four more releases by the band would appear on this chart, ending with the EP Miss Modular in 1997.) Their third album, Mars Audiac Quintet, was released in August 1994. The album contains the single \\"Ping Pong\\", which gained press coverage for its allegedly explicit Marxist lyrics. The band focused more on pop and less on rock, resulting in what AllMusic described as \\"what may be the group's most accessible, tightly-written album\\". It was the last album to feature O'Hagan as a full-time member. He would continue to make guest appearances on later releases. The group issued an EP titled Music for the Amorphous Body Study Center in April 1995. The EP was their musical contribution to an interactive art exhibit put on in collaboration with New York City artist Charles Long. Their second compilation of rarities, titled Refried Ectoplasm (Switched On, Vol. 2), was released in July 1995. answer the following question: What EP was their musical contribution to an interactive art exhibit?

In the first sentence, \\"He's just been released from Shadwell nick prison after doing ten years for attempted murder,\\" the word \\"nick\\" is referring to the prison where the person was incarcerated for ten years. The term \\"Shadwell nick\\" is used colloquially to describe the specific prison, which might be a familiar term to the locals or people acquainted with the British prison system. In the second sentence, \\"He's in the nick,\\" the meaning of \\"nick\\" is still the same, as it is referring to a prison or jail in a general sense. The sentence is an informal way of stating that the person is in prison, without providing any specific details about the location or circumstances.

As Ashkenazi Jews moved away from Europe, mostly in the form of aliyah to Israel, or immigration to North America, and other English-speaking areas; and Europe (particularly France) and Latin America, the geographic isolation that gave rise to Ashkenazim has given way to mixing with other cultures, and with non-Ashkenazi Jews who, similarly, are no longer isolated in distinct geographic locales.

The Court of Cassation, the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the Palais de Justice on the Île de la Cité, while the Conseil d'État, which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement. The Constitutional Council, an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws and government decrees, also meets in the Montpensier wing of the Palais Royal.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Among the options provided, civil cases are not reviewed by the Conseil d'État. The Conseil d'État is primarily responsible for providing legal advice to the executive and acting as the highest court in the administrative order, which includes judging litigation against public bodies. On the other hand, the Court of Cassation is the highest court in the judicial order, and its main function is to review civil and criminal cases. France has a dual judicial system, with distinct courts for administrative and civil/criminal matters. The Conseil d'État, located in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement of Paris, plays a critical role in the administrative division of the legal system. This court deals with disputes and litigation involving public bodies, including actions taken by the state, municipal governments, and other public authorities. The role of the Conseil d'État is to ensure that the actions of public bodies conform to the principles of legality and justice, as well as to protect the rights of citizens who may be affected by the actions of these entities. In addition to judging litigation against public bodies, the Conseil d'État serves another significant function: providing legal advice to the executive branch of the French government. This function includes offering guidance on the drafting and implementation of laws, regulations, and administrative decisions. The Conseil d'État may also have a consultative role in specific instances, depending on the nature and complexity of the case, but its primary function is to ensure the legality of governmental action. The Court of Cassation, situated in the Palais de Justice on the Île de la Cité, is the highest court in the judicial order. It is responsible for reviewing civil and criminal cases. Its central role is to maintain consistency and coherence in the application of the law across France by ensuring that lower courts correctly interpret and apply French legal rules and principles. The Court of Cassation does not reexamine the facts of a case but rather focuses on whether the law was correctly applied in a given case. If the court finds errors in judgment, it can reverse the ruling of the lower court and return the case to a lower court for reassessment. In conclusion, the Conseil d'État mainly focuses on litigation against public bodies and providing legal advice to the executive, while the Court of Cassation is responsible for reviewing civil and criminal cases in France. Consequently, civil cases are not reviewed by the Conseil d'État."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Ask if there are any cough drops at the house or where the box of kleenex is. Don't overdo it with the parents. Explanation: (1) is incorrect because the sentence is both confusing and contradictory. It starts by mentioning that the person is not feeling well that morning but then switches to mentioning that they are sick at night. It is unclear and does not effectively convey a believable message to parents. (2) is also incorrect as it contains several phrases that don't make sense, like \\"sick/sick/whatever you're faking\\" and \\"super friendly.\\" These phrases do not effectively convey the message of pretending to be sick. (3) is not a good option because by saying, \\"I feel better today than when I got here,\\" you are suggesting that you are feeling better, not worse, which contradicts the idea of faking sick. Furthermore, discussing feeling unwell at lunch and telling others that they are worried is not an effective way to fake sick to the school nurse. (4) is the correct answer because it provides a believable and subtle way to convey the idea of being unwell to the parents. Asking about cough drops or the location of a box of kleenex is a more indirect approach that does not come across as overacting, making it a more convincing strategy.

Article: Boko Haram has overtaken Isis as the world’s most deadly terrorist organisation, according to a new report. The Nigerian-based terror group, also known as Islamic State’s West’s Africa province (ISWAP), was responsible for 6,644 deaths in 2014. In comparison, Isis is believed to have killed 6,073 people in the same period. Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the group, also known as the Islamic State, in March of this year. Isis has certainly sought - and achieved - global notoriety since it announced its creation of a caliphate across Syria and Iraq in June 2014. It has its own media arm which pumps out propaganda videos and messages to either inspire supporters or strike fear into those it regards as enemies with graphic footage glorifying executions and torture. It has also claimed responsibility for the most recent terror attacks in Paris and Egypt, where a plane containing 229 was downed. Boko Haram carries out most of its atrocities in north Africa. Over the past year, Nigeria witnessed a 300 per cent rise in fatalities from terror acts to 7,512. This is the largest increase in terrorist-caused deaths ever recorded by any country, and is predominantly down to Boko Haram’s expansion. In 2013, Nigeria ranked fifth in terms of the highest levels of deaths, but moved to second last year. Boko Haram is not limited to Nigeria: in 2014 the group doubled its attack and expanded into Chad and Cameroon, in 2014 staging 46 attacks and claiming 520 lives. While increased use of explosives and bombs – thanks to training from other terrorist outfits – has characterised more recent Boko Haram attacks, the majority of attacks remain armed assaults using machine guns. The data, published in the third edition of the Global Terrorism Index, was produced by the Institute for Economic and Peace, and drawn from data collected by the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), collated by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. ||||| The grisly attacks in France and Lebanon last week have fixed attention on the violence perpetrated by ISIS. But a study published this week indicates that the world’s deadliest terrorist organization actually operates thousands of miles south of Paris and Beirut, in Nigeria. The 2015 Global Terrorism Index, published by the Institute for Economics & Peace, found that Boko Haram, the Nigerian jihadist group, was responsible for 6,644 deaths in 2014, compared with 6,073 at the hands of ISIS. Boko Haram, which was founded in 2002 as an Islamist movement against Western education and morphed into an armed insurgency in 2009, has rapidly expanded its scope and ambitions over the past two years, achieving international notoriety in the spring of 2014 by kidnapping more than 200 schoolgirls. Much like ISIS, the organization controls territory in Nigeria (although it has lost some of it over the past year) and has declared a caliphate in that territory. The group is also international; although based in northeastern Nigeria, it has launched attacks in Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. In the latest incident, Boko Haram is the suspected author of an attack in the Nigerian city of Yola that has left more than 30 people dead. Global Terrorism Database / Institute for Economics and Peace The scale of Boko Haram’s bloodlust may come as a surprise to those who are more used to hearing about Mosul than Maiduguri, but the Obama administration is well aware of the threat posed by the group. The U.S. government has been providing training, equipment, and funding to countries menaced by Boko Haram, though it has notably declined to sell weapons to the Nigerian government. Two weeks before announcing his decision to send Special Operations Forces into Syria, Barack Obama authorized the deployment of 300 U.S. troops to Cameroon, accompanied by unarmed Predator drones, to help in the struggle against the Nigerian terrorist group. Data from the Global Terrorism Index, which is based on the University of Maryland’s database of terrorist attacks around the world since 1970, demonstrates why Boko Haram is worthy of such attention. In last year’s index, which my colleague Kathy Gilsinan explored, Nigeria had the fourth-highest number of deaths by terrorism of any country in the world; in this year’s, it had the second-highest, falling only behind Iraq. Nigeria also experienced the largest increase in deaths from terrorism on record: a 300-percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Notably, Boko Haram was responsible for fewer terrorist incidents than ISIS—453 compared with 1,071—which only emphasizes the lethality of its attacks. In 2014, the group perpetrated half of the world’s 20 most fatal terrorist attacks. |||||Summary:","completion":"A new report by the Institute for Economics & Peace reveals that Boko Haram has now overtaken ISIS as the world's deadliest terrorist organization.

Given the background: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. and the situation: United States has varied geographical characteristics. Take for example, the Mississippi Delta. The delta has vast wetland that gets inundated every year. On the contrary, farther west, the Mojave Desert in Nevada sees very little precipitation or floodwater. Both places are beautiful in their own right, and attract many tourists every year. Answer the following question: Which place would see less nitrification, Mississippi Delta or Mojave Desert?","completion":"Given the background information on hypoxic soils and their effect on nitrification, we can determine which location would see less nitrification by comparing the characteristics of both Mississippi Delta and Mojave Desert. Here are the steps to deduce the answer: Step 1: Assess environmental conditions of both locations Mississippi Delta: This area is a vast wetland that experiences annual inundation, leading to flooded soils and formation of hypoxic conditions. Under these conditions, soil microorganisms consume oxygen rapidly, leading to low oxygen availability. Mojave Desert: This area receives very little precipitation or floodwater, indicating that the soil is less likely to be flooded and hypoxic conditions are less likely to develop. Step 2: Consider the effect of hypoxic conditions on nitrification When hypoxic conditions develop, nitrification is inhibited, as there is a lack of oxygen in the soil. Anaerobic bacteria use alternative electron acceptors, such as nitrate, manganese, and sulfate, leading to the formation of toxic compounds. Step 3: Compare the nitrification rates in both locations Mississippi Delta: The wetland environment, with its hypoxic conditions, would inhibit nitrification due to the lack of oxygen. Mojave Desert: The desert environment, with less likelihood of flooded soils and hypoxic conditions, would likely have a higher rate of nitrification compared to the Mississippi Delta. Conclusion: The Mississippi Delta would see less nitrification due to its wetland environment and the presence of hypoxic soils, as compared to the Mojave Desert, which has a lower likelihood of developing hypoxic conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. I am facing a new situation today: In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In battle day one would group A have less openings or more openings in their nest thatch? The answer is:","completion":"In battle day one, group A would have less openings in their nest thatch. According to the background article, Acromyrmex heyeri ants create more openings in the nest thatch when the internal nest temperature goes up and the temperature range is between 20-30°C. This is done as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. On battle day one, the temperature in group A's territory was 5°C. This is significantly lower than the temperature range mentioned in the article for creating more openings in the nest thatch. Additionally, the article states that workers will close openings in the nest thatch when the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases, in order to reduce water loss for the colony. Although battle day one does not specifically mention the air humidity levels, it is reasonable to assume that the lower temperature of 5°C would also result in a lower internal nest temperature, causing the ants to create fewer openings in the nest thatch to maintain warmth and prevent excessive cooling of the nest. Therefore, group A would likely have less openings in their nest thatch on battle day one."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law. After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien. Honoré III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be...

Read this: On 23 June 1757, the English East India Company defeated Siraj-ud-Daula, the Nawab of Bengal, in the Battle of Plassey. The British thus became masters of east India (Bengal, Bihar, Orissa) – a prosperous region with a flourishing agriculture, industry and trade. This led to a large amount of children being forced into labour due to the increasing need of cheap labour to produce large numbers of goods. Many multinationals often employed children because that they can be recruited for less pay, and have more endurance to utilise in factory environments. Another reason many Indian children were hired was because they lack knowledge of their basic rights, they did not cause trouble or complain, and they were often more trustworthy. The innocence that comes with childhood was utilised to make a profit by many and was encouraged by the need for family income.

Attempting to bounce back from the Week 2 loss to the Packers, the Bears faced the St. Louis Rams. Throughout the course of the game, the Bears defense sacked Rams quarterback Sam Bradford six times, marking the first time the Bears defense has recorded at least five sacks in back-to-back games since the team's 2001 season. The six sacks increased the Bears season sack total to 14, which led the league, and is the most they have recorded in the first three games since 1987. On the offensive side, however, Jay Cutler completed only 17 of 31 passes for 183 yards and an interception (by Cortland Finnegan; Finnegan appeared to fumble on the return, and the ball was recovered by Bears receiver Devin Hester, but the fumble was overturned), and a mere passer rating of 58.9. With running back Matt Forte out for the game, the Bears rushing attack ran for 103 yards and Michael Bush ran for a 3-yard touchdown. In the second quarter, Rams kicker Greg Zuerlein kicked a 56-yard field goal, the longest in Soldier Field history.

Write a \\"negative\\" movie review (pick from the following. - negative. - positive.).","completion":"Title: The Disappointing Delusion - A Review of \\"Dreamworld\\" After much anticipation and hype, \\"Dreamworld\\" finally made its way to theaters, and unfortunately, it has severely underwhelmed audiences, including me. What could have been an unforgettable cinematic experience turned out to be a forgettable and mediocre attempt. In this review, I will highlight the factors that make this movie a major letdown. First and foremost, the plot was aimless and completely lost its essence along the way. Although the concept of diving into a world where dreams and reality blend together was initially intriguing, the poor execution led to a convoluted and underwhelming narrative. There were too many loosely connected subplots instead of a single coherent storyline. This ultimately left me questioning the purpose of many scenes and feeling unfulfilled at the end. Secondly, the pacing was a complete disaster. Protracted scenes that failed to move the story forward turned the entire experience into a test of patience. The movie had moments where it would capture the right tone, only to drop it instantly during the next scene. With a runtime of over two and a half hours, I expected a richer, more meaningful story, instead the filmmakers dragged the audience through an endless maze of dream sequences that resulted in inertia instead of progression. Character development, or the lack thereof, was another disappointing aspect of the film. The protagonists, who at first showed promise, all suffered at the hands of the weak script and bland dialogues. Consequently, their motivations and decisions felt like mere plot devices rather than genuine human behavior. It was difficult to empathize with the characters, and the audience was left with no one to root for or connect with. The major redeeming factor of \\"Dreamworld\\" was its visuals. Indeed, the movie was visually stunning with impressive visual effects. However, dazzling visuals cannot compensate for the lack of substance, and this movie is a prime example of that. Lastly, the climax ended up being more chaotic than the thrilling showdown it could have been. By the time we reached the much-awaited conclusion, it was anti-climactic and felt rushed, leaving too many questions unanswered. It was evident that the filmmakers attempted to add a last-minute twist, but sadly, it added nothing to the overall story. In conclusion, \\"Dreamworld\\" was a major letdown that failed to live up to its potential. With a confusing plot, unengaging characters, and uneven pacing, it's distressing to see such a conceptually interesting idea fall flat. While the visuals are impressive, they do not make up for the overall disappointing experience. Sadly, I cannot recommend this movie."},{"prompt":"Possible answers: (1). No. (2). Yes.

ROCK AROUND THE BOX CD sets for stuffing outsize Xmas stockings Sunday, December 17th 2000, 2:15AM Deck the halls with bulky box sets ... Every year at this time, the music industry sends those fat, multi-CD compilations lumbering into stores, providing a godsend for otherwise stumped gift-givers. After 10 years of this trend, you'd think record companies would have strip-mined their entire back catalogues by now. This year, a new batch of top-line artists have sanctioned significant work in box-set form. Here are the most notable: All of Bowie's '70s changes warranted awe, but his most exciting period came early in the decade. The second disc from this triple-CD set clarifies the point by featuring dizzyingly fine live recordings cut for the BBC (or \\"Beeb\\") during 1972. Largely composed of songs from \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" and \\"Space Oddity,\\" the disc captures the peak of Bowie's most animated band, the Spiders From Mars, highlighted as it was by the fiery guitar work of the late Mick Ronson. Songs like \\"Hang on to Yourself\\" never sounded more frantic. The three chords of \\"Queen Bitch\\" swish with vintage glitter-rock flair. The disc includes smart covers of the Velvet Underground songs that helped inspire Bowie's chord changes: \\"White Light\\" and \\"Waiting for the Man.\\" Much less tightly focused, the first disc contains nascent BBC performances from 1968, before Bowie found his voice. The foppish, loungy songs here will appeal only to those with an encyclopedic interest in the star. You'll find far more verve on the third disc, cut this past June. Bowie's latest band downplays his recent forays into electronica to emphasize grandly arranged ballads of old, like \\"Wild as the Wind\\" and \\"Absolute Beginners,\\" not to mention elegant takes on songs like \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" and \\"The Man Who Sold the World.\\" If the Ziggy disc makes this set a must-buy, the third disc gives it something rare for a box set - a reason to cheer the artist's present as well as his past. LITTLE FEAT \\"HOTCAKES & OUTTAKES\\" (RHINO) Imagine combining the sensibility of a singer-songwriter with the chunky rhythms of funk. Mix in some country and blues and you've got the all-American formula Little Feat perfected during their '70s heyday. Led by the late Lowell George, Feat put out eight striking albums between 1970 and '81 without achieving more than cult status. You'll find the best of those records on the box set's first two discs, with highlights like the near-hit \\"Easy to Slip,\\" \\"Willin'\\" (later a radio staple for Linda Ronstadt) and \\"Dixie Chicken\\" (from which the Dixie Chicks took their name). Disc three features the incarnation of Little Feat that got together seven years after George's death, and proved that he was hardly their only strong foot. Writers like Bill Payne, Paul Barrere, Craig Fuller and Fred Tackett (who penned Bonnie Raitt's \\"Fool Yourself\\") continued to show their worth. The fourth CD culls the catacombs for outtakes, rarities and live cuts that should please fanatics. For everyone else, \\"Hotcakes\\" makes a great case for Little Feat as an American classic. LOS LOBOS \\"EL CANCIONERO - MAS Y MAS\\" (RHINO) Who could have imagined that any group could play traditional Mexican boleros, Cuban folk songs, American rockabilly, New Orleans blues, Southern R&B and cowboy rancheras with equal authority? Los Lobos stirred a deep melting pot of sounds from the start of their 25-year career, mixing scores of Spanish-speaking and Anglo genres. No wonder they're gods - second only to Santana - in the Latin rock movement. Los Lobos' four-CD set has to cover a wide field of recordings, since the band has appeared on so many soundtracks, tribute albums and compilations. \\"El Cancionero\\" does an admirable job of grazing the catalogue for highlights. The range of genres the group spans keeps the set from settling into sameness. Singer David Hidalgo's boyish passion ties it all together. The most wide-eyed pop singer since Steve Winwood, he has the angelic quality of a choirboy and enough depth to give soul to any style he tries. No guitarist since Jimi Hendrix played with more ruthless physicality than Vaughan. No wonder his guitar looked like a hurricane had hit it. In a way, one did. Like all guitarists who get sweaty and adventurous, Vaughan rarely played songs the same way twice, which makes this new box set of mainly rare live cuts as valuable as his prime studio recordings. Its three CDs include songs from an unreleased \\"MTV Unplugged,\\" an early cut with the band that came before the famed Double Trouble, and several numbers recorded at Alpine Valley just two days before the 1990 helicopter crash that took Vaughan's life. The gem, though, is a DVD capturing a never-released 30-minute 1989 performance for the TV show \\"Austin City Limits.\\" All the recordings prove one thing: While other guitarists may play as fast or as hard as Vaughan, few blessed with such virtuosic skills have played with as much heart. From their start in 1970, the Electric Light Orchestra specialized in rococo pop that overlaid their Beatlesque tunes with art-rock strings. As pomp-rockers, they were rivaled only by Queen. ELO put out its \\"Afterglow\\" box set 10 years ago, but it only included previously issued hits and suffered from pedestrian sound. To correct this, the group's leader, Jeff Lynne, oversaw this new set, adding seven unreleased tracks and digitally enhancing the quality to get the most out of his 10-layer-cake production. The spruced up sound of the new discs gives Lynne's dense tracks fresh definition. It's great to hear all the instrumentation clearly articulated on hits like \\"Strange Magic,\\" \\"Evil Woman\\" and \\"Livin' Thing.\\" The three new CDs collect not only all of ELO's main hits but also unearth cuts like Lynne's own take on \\"Xanadu\\" (which far outstrips Olivia Newton-John's hit version). Fans of flounce can't do better. Some teen idols have real talent. Take Rick Nelson. Music's very first telegenic rock star may have been signed for his pouty lips and pretty face, but he had an affectingly pure voice too. In the tradition of Buddy Holly, he made rockabilly innocent. Nelson's long-deserved box set, \\"Legacy,\\" goes a bit far in trying to shore up his reputation, which was strong with fellow musicians and critics but unproven with the public. Four CDs with more than a hundred tracks may be too much, especially since they include too many alternate versions of songs. Luckily, the highlights are high indeed. The early tracks on the first two CDs feature a great band, including guitarist James Burton (who later worked with Elvis). You'll find many of Nelson's best hits here, among them a version of \\"I'm Walkin'\\" cut when he was 16, \\"Lonesome Town\\" and \\"Hello Mary Lou.\\" You can hear how he influenced pop-leaning rockabilly stars like Chris Isaak and Dave Edmunds. The later CDs cover Nelson's shift into country and folk rock in the early '70s. They include his version of Dylan's \\"Love Minus Zero,\\" plus \\"Garden Party,\\" the cult classic about his inability to win an audience for his new music. In the 15 years since Nelson died in a plane crash, his stature has grown among the cognoscenti. The Backstreet Boys can only hope history will treat them so well. DION \\"KING OF THE NEW YORK STREETS\\" (CAPITOL) Dion is as associated with the vanished history of N.Y.C. as the Brooklyn Dodgers, egg creams and muggings. He captured the heart of New York while moving through at least three major phases, which are evenly traced on this three-CD set. The first one corrals his pompadour years, when he served as the original Fonzie (or sometimes Cunningham), with hits like \\"Teenager in Love,\\" \\"Runaround Sue\\" and \\"Donna the Prima Donna.\\" With his aching falsetto and strutting rockabilly chords, Dion DiMucci combined doo-wop with a singer-songwriter's personal angst. As the second CD shows, Dion reinvented himself as a folk artist, first with \\"Abraham, Martin & John\\" and later through his take on the period classic \\"The Dolphins\\" and the ruminative \\"Your Own Backyard.\\" Disc No. 3 has Dion morphing into a '70s-style singer-songwriter who turned his own history into myth. Ever the perfectionists, the Eagles would never think of putting anything as unfussy as outtakes on their box set. Nor would they let a song languish untouched in the studio long enough to become a rarity. This means that there's little new on this four-CD package. To lend some variety, they organized their catalogue into categories like \\"The Ballads\\" (CD No. 2) or \\"The Fast Lane\\" (the harder stuff, on CD 3). The first disc, \\"The Early Years,\\" contains hits like \\"Take It Easy\\" and \\"Already Gone.\\" The fourth offers 12 songs from the group's reunion show on Millennium Eve. The band's self-consciousness ensures that the live versions rarely sound different from the studio takes. Together, the set captures the band's limitations (its sexism, smugness and fake outsider status) as well as its strengths (perfect harmonies and fluid melodies). The Eagles may have lacked depth and humility, but they remain a model of pop craft. THE JIMI HENDRIX EXPERIENCE (MCA) Did Jimi Hendrix so much as burp without somebody recording it? This seems like the nine-zillionth box set issued under the guitar god's name. It yields 56 more unreleased recordings. Don't get the wrong idea. There is great stuff here, simply because it is Hendrix. So if your collection of the master's work is thin and you don't have any of the earlier box sets, you may want this one. But for those who have followed the story so far, only Hendrix fetishists will be able to tell the difference between some of these \\"alternate\\" performances and previous ones. If you really want to own a version of \\"Purple Haze\\" whose primary point of distinction is that it fades out instead of ends, you are more than welcome to it. While you're at it, you may also want to consider seeking professional help.

The teacher was giving us our results for a Chinese test. I had done badly. I felt so sad that I wouldn't talk to anyone. At lunchtime, I even stayed in the classroom alone. Suddenly, I heard a voice. It was Vanilla. \\"You look very unhappy,\\" she said. \\"What's wrong?\\" I looked up at her, but said nothing. I knew Vallina had got a good mark in the test. I thought she was making fun of me. I stayed silent , but Vallina didn't go away. She kept asking me questions: \\"Is it because of the exam? Do you want me to show you the right answers?\\" I looked away from her. When I looked up again, Vanilla had gone. And so had my exam paper! I didn't know what to do.

GOP foreign policy elites don’t know whether they’ll serve if Trump is president When the Republican foreign policy elite gets together these days, conversation quickly veers from challenges such as the Islamic State or North Korea to focus on two questions. How has Donald Trump come so close to becoming the party’s standard-bearer? If Trump were elected president, would any of them serve in his administration? “It’s the only thing we can talk about,” said Eliot Cohen, professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University and a former George W. Bush administration official. He’s answered the second question by spearheading an anti-Trump petition, which now has signatures of 121 GOP national security experts. Others are not sure how they would respond to a call from Trump. “Leaving any particular president completely alone and bereft from the best advice people could give him just doesn’t sound responsible,” said another former senior Republican official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “I would never say never, but it’s hard to envision myself,” the former official said. Many of Trump’s foreign policy pronouncements — retreating from NATO, targeting the families of terror suspects and tearing up existing trade deals, among others — are anathema to the Republican national security mainstream. In any case, the former official said, “I haven’t been asked.” Listen to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump discuss some of his foreign policy positions with The Washington Post editorial board. “NATO is costing us a fortune,” Trump said. “We’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do.” (The Washington Post) Trump, who has cited himself as his primary foreign policy adviser, has announced eight team members so far, one of whom has discrepancies on his résumé. George Papadopoulous, a 2009 graduate of DePaul University, has described himself in several lengthy published résumés as an oil and gas consultant and expert in eastern Mediterranean energy policy. But his claim to have served for several years as a fellow at the Washington-based Hudson Institute was refuted by David Tell, Hudson senior fellow and director of public affairs, who said the institute’s “records indicate that Mr. Papadopoulos started here as an unpaid intern in 2011 and subsequently provided some contractual research assistance to one of our senior fellows.” Papadopoulos also lists attendance as “U.S. Representative at the 2012 Geneva International Model United Nations.” Two people who were part of the delegation that year, including Antony Papadopoulos (no relation), current secretary general of the Geneva program, said they had no recollection of him being there. He also cites the delivery of a keynote address at the 2008 annual American Hellenic Institute Foundation Conference. The conference agenda that year noted Papadopoulos’s participation on a youth panel with other students; it lists 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis as the keynote speaker. Asked via his LinkedIn account about these discrepancies, Papadopoulos initially replied with a question. “Is it true that the ‘establishment GOP foreign policy advisers,’ many of whom I’ve met, are confused why the presidential front runner chose a group of experts with regional, on the ground experience, with track records of getting deals done with governments, instead of relying on their failed policies they likely devised at Starbucks on Pennsylvania Ave? If so, I am very shocked.” He referred subsequent emailed questions about the discrepancies, how he met Trump, what he admires in the candidate’s foreign policy vision and what he would like to achieve in a Trump administration to campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks. Trump does not appear to have cast a wide net so far. Of the eight team members Trump has announced, four have a military background. They include retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, retired Maj. Gen. Gary Harrell, retired Rear Adm. Chuck Kubic and reserve Maj. Gen. Bert Mizusawa. Other members of the team include Carter Page, who heads a New York-based energy investment firm. Walid Phares, a Maronite Christian who was a political adviser to Lebanese militants during their war against Muslim factions during the 1980s, is a regular Fox News commentator on terrorism. Another team member, Joseph Schmitz, was the controversial inspector general at the Defense Department from 2002 to 2005. He later spent three years as a senior official at the Prince Group, the parent company of the security firm Blackwater. Trump has also named Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a lawmaker not known for his interest or experience in foreign policy, as his national security coordinator. A source close to former CIA head and retired Gen. David Petraeus said that a Trump emissary had tried to set up a meeting between them early this year, but it has yet to take place. Some of those Trump has mentioned with admiration have denied they are on his team. Asked last month if the respect Trump voiced for him was mutual, Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass told NPR that he had briefed Trump, among other candidates, once last year and said, “I simply don’t know him well enough to give you that kind of judgment.” On April 1, Trump’s foreign policy team held its first group meeting with the candidate at the Washington construction site where a hotel bearing his name will soon open. One way to judge a candidate is by the company they keep, although the size of the team and timing of its announcement can vary widely. Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, has assembled a foreign policy cast of hundreds, while Bernie Sanders has not yet announced a formal team. On the Republican side, Jeb Bush released a list of 21 foreign policy advisers in early 2015, months before he even declared he was running for the presidency. By contrast, Marco Rubio announced his own list of 18 advisers (including Cohen) just a week before he withdrew from the race last month. But in both cases, the choices were virtually all former senior officials in previous Republican administrations, and the message they sought to impart was the same. Experience, stability, no surprises. Four from Bush’s campaign, which ended in late February, signed on with Rubio. John Kasich’s hefty list of 39 national security advisers, released in February, is a mix of former officials, experts and academics, and former lawmakers, most of whom would be considered moderates in the heated GOP atmosphere. In mid-March, Ted Cruz announced a 23-member “national security coalition.” About one-quarter are former mid-level Republican officials. Others range from retired Lt. Gen. William G. Boykin, president of the conservative Family Research Council, to former Missouri senator Jim Talent, who served as an adviser to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s campaign before Walker became an early primary dropout. Only in the case of Trump have significant numbers of former officials and retired military officers publicly declared they would never work for him. In addition to Cohen’s petition, a separate group of retired officers and prominent members of prior GOP administrations have called on the military to disobey orders to torture captured suspected terrorists or target their families. Trump “is a massive outlier,” said Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, an officially nonpartisan antiterrorism think tank where many Republicans have found an out-of-office home. But beyond those who have said they would never work for Trump, “there are hundreds and hundreds left who have stayed silent.” For many, he said, self-interest may triumph over ideology if and when it becomes clear Trump will be the GOP nominee. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The Republican foreign policy elite are concerned about the prospect of serving under a potential Donald Trump presidency, given that his foreign policy pronouncements, such as retreating from NATO, targeting the families of terror suspects, and tearing up existing trade deals, are contrary to the Republican national security mainstream. As the Republican frontrunner, Trump has cited himself as his primary foreign policy adviser and has announced eight members on his foreign policy team so far. However, Trump has not cast a wide net with his selections, and some of those he has mentioned with admiration have denied they are on his team. The situation has led to significant numbers of former officials and retired military officers publicly declaring they would never work for Trump, with some calling on the military to disobey orders to torture captured terrorists or target their families. Despite this, some believe self-interest may triumph over ideology if Trump becomes the GOP nominee."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

For example, they will say\\"It's a fine day, isn't it?\\"\\"Do you think it will rain?\\" Many people believe that they are able to tell what the weather will be like. But they never agree with each other. One man may say, \\"How cloudy it is now! It's going to rain.\\" Another man will say, \\"No, it's going to be fine later.\\" People always hope the weather they want. For example, when a farmer needs water, he looks for something to tell him it's going to rain. When a man wants to travel, he is sure the weather will be fine quickly.

Definition: In this task, you're expected to write answers to questions involving multiple references to the same entity. The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer. Input: Passage: In 1979, the locomotive was renumbered \\"1881\\", painted black with silver stripes, and leased to a Hollywood company for use in the filming of the horror movie Terror Train (1979), starring Jamie Lee Curtis. In 1980, the locomotive was repainted with a color scheme used by Canadian Pacific in the 1930s. The black, gold, and Tuscan red paint job was popular with railroad enthusiasts and photographers. The number 1293 was also restored to the engine. In February 1982, the headlights, handrails, and cab roof of 1293 were damaged when the roof of a Steamtown storage building gave way to heavy snow.Although the Steamtown Special History Study reasoned that, since this type of locomotive had historically operated in New England, perhaps as far south as Boston, it qualified to be part of the federal government's collection, the Canadian native sat unused for 12 years following the move to Scranton. Ohio Central Railroad System purchased it in 1996, and it underwent a 13-month restoration. As of July 2010, Ohio Central Railroad has lost control of most of its holdings, but former owner, Jerry Joe Jacobson, maintained a collection of vintage equipment including CPR 1293 and her sister, CRP 1278, which is also a veteran of Steamtown, U.S.A. operational locomotives. No. 1293 is still operational as of October 2011.Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1278, like her sister, CPR 1293, was also built by Canadian Locomotive Company in 1948, and is a type 4-6-2, class G5d light-weight \\"Pacific\\" locomotive. It was purchased by Blount in May 1965, and renumbered 127. Blount had planned to renumber all three of the series 1200 CRP locomotives in his collection from 1246, 1278, and 1293 to 124, 127 and 129 respectively, but 1278 was the only one of the three that underwent the change. The new number remained on the locomotive from 1966 until 1973, when its former number was restored. The locomotive was leased to the Cadillac and Lake City Railroad in Michigan from 1970 to 1971. After some repair work, the locomotive was returned to Bellows Falls where it served on excursion runs. After moving to Scranton, CPR 1278 was traded to the Gettysburg Steam Railroad in Pennsylvania. Question: What company was the locomotive that was leased to a railroad in Michigan traded to after serving in Bellows Falls and Scranton?

Q: what is the fourth amendment in the bill of rights? A:","completion":"The Fourth Amendment in the Bill of Rights is an essential component of the United States Constitution that protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures as well as ensuring the right to privacy. Ratified on December 15, 1791, as part of the first ten amendments, the Bill of Rights aimed to safeguard individual liberties and limit government powers. The Fourth Amendment, in particular, stands as a bulwark against potential abuses of power by government authorities. The text of the Fourth Amendment reads as follows: \\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\\" The importance of the Fourth Amendment arises from its intent to strike a balance between individuals' rights to privacy and the necessity for law enforcement to investigate and prevent crime. This amendment protects citizens from arbitrary intrusion by the government into their private lives, ensuring that searches and seizures can only be conducted if specific conditions are met. Firstly, the Fourth Amendment mandates that searches and seizures must be based on \\"probable cause.\\" Probable cause refers to a reasonable belief that a crime has been or is being committed, and that evidence of the crime can be found in the location to be searched. This standard prevents law enforcement officers from conducting searches on a whim or based on personal biases. Secondly, the amendment requires that searches and seizures must be supported by a warrant. A warrant is a legal document issued by a judge or magistrate, authorizing law enforcement to conduct a search or seizure. The warrant process provides an additional layer of protection for citizens, as it ensures that an impartial third party – a judge – evaluates whether probable cause exists before authorizing the search or seizure. Lastly, the Fourth Amendment specifies that the warrant must \\"particularly describe the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\\" This requirement prevents overly broad or general warrants and ensures that law enforcement officers cannot exceed the scope of the warrant when conducting a search or seizure. Over time, the Supreme Court has developed and refined the application of the Fourth Amendment through various landmark cases. The Court's interpretation has extended the amendment's protections to apply not only to physical searches and seizures but also to electronic surveillance and interception of communications. The Court has also established the \\"exclusionary rule,\\" which prohibits the use of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment in criminal trials. In conclusion, the Fourth Amendment plays a crucial role in protecting citizens' rights to privacy and guarding against abuses of power by government officials. It has evolved over time to adapt to changing technologies and societal expectations, while preserving the essential balance between individual liberties and public safety. By promoting judicial oversight, requiring probable cause, and specifying the nature of searches and seizures, the Fourth Amendment remains a central pillar of individual freedom and the rule of law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Just as the stock market rises and falls in response to what people are willing to put their money behind, we have inside ourselves an inner economy that rises and falls in response to our beliefs about what is possible. Sometimes the degree to which we are willing to challenge our belief systems determines the success of our inner economy. For example, imagine that your family of origin had a belief that musical talent was not something they possessed. As a member of that group, you would likely inherit that same belief about yourself. As a result, even if you had a great desire to create music, you might be hesitant to really get behind yourself, fearing that your investment would not pay off. Even if you had the courage to follow your passion, your inner belief that you are not inherently talented would probably be a major drawback to investing your energy in your dream. On the other hand, if you found a way to release that negative belief, a great flood of energy would pour forth, greatly increasing the likelihood of your success. How much energy we are willing to invest in the various ideas, dreams, and visions we carry within is like the money people are, or are not, willing to invest in the various products available for trade on the stock market. And in both cases, belief plays a key role in determining how willing we are to get behind something. One way to open up the possibility for greater success in our inner economies is to understand that belief is not the reliable guide we sometimes think. There are other more reliable things of success that we can put our faith in, such as passion, feeling, and sense. Some of the most successful investors in the stock market are the ones that go against the grain (to be something that one does not like doing), trusting their sense over the common opinion held by common people about what will work. In the same way, we can learn to trust our heart's desires and our sense to guide us, questioning any beliefs that stand in the way of our ability to fully invest... Question: We can put our faith in the following things of success except_. Options: A: passion B: feeling C: sense D: stock market The answer to this question is:","completion":"D: stock market"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:I can use this background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.

Step 4: Conclude which gardener observed more improved mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. - Since Bill used mycorrhizal fungi compost and Hank used regular top soil, it is likely that Bill observed more improved mineral nutrient absorption from the soil due to the presence of the beneficial fungi.

In 1955 in Portland, Oregon, a businessman finds his wife in bed with another man, and commits a double murder-suicide. His young son, Paul, witnesses the three deaths, and is traumatized. Twenty-five years later, in 1980, Paul is incarcerated at a psychiatric institution near Stanford Bay, a small town on the Oregon Coast. One day, Paul manages to murder an orderly, and subsequently retrieves a beloved wooden flute given to him by his father before escaping the institution. Local teenager Marion is struggling to adjust to her disability—she survived a car accident several years prior, caused by her drunken father Frank, which left her unable to walk without the help of a leg brace. She is plagued by bizarre dreams, which she comes to discover are in fact premonitions; while in the hospital after her accident, she received a blood transfusion from Paul, which has given her extrasensory perception into Paul's actions. Marion's home life is troubled, with her father being verbally abusive to her and her mother, Bea, and she dreams of leaving Stanford Bay once her fisherman boyfriend, Joey, obtains a job in Portland. Meanwhile, Paul hitchhikes with a truck driver whom he bludgeons to death with a hatchet, and then steals his vehicle.

This is some data: Giraffe eatType coffee shop; Giraffe priceRange moderate; Giraffe customer rating 1 out of 5; Giraffe familyFriendly yes; Giraffe near The Bakers. Generate a detailed description of this data.","completion":"Giraffe is a coffee shop with distinct attributes and evaluation based on the given data. The information provided outlines several aspects such as the type of establishment, price range, customer rating, family-friendliness, and its location in relation to other nearby businesses. Here is an in-depth analysis of the data presented: 1. Establishment Type: The data reveals that Giraffe is a coffee shop. As a coffee shop, customers can expect a casual and relaxed atmosphere where they can enjoy a variety of caffeinated beverages, as well as an assortment of light snacks, pastries, and possibly small meal options. The establishment likely focuses on serving high-quality coffee while providing a cozy and welcoming environment for customers to socialize, work, or unwind. 2. Price Range: The price range for Giraffe is described as moderate, meaning that the costs of items on the menu are neither too low nor too high. This suggests that Giraffe aims to cater to a broad customer base, offering reasonably priced food and drinks that most individuals can afford. Customers visiting Giraffe can anticipate spending an average amount, as compared to other nearby coffee shops, for their purchases. 3. Customer Rating: Giraffe has a customer rating of 1 out of 5, which is a notably low score. This indicates that the overall customer satisfaction for the establishment is poor. This low rating may stem from factors such as subpar quality of products offered, inadequate service or ambience, uncleanliness, or any combination of these and other potential issues. Prospective visitors might approach the coffee shop with caution, as its reputation could be viewed as questionable due to this negative feedback. 4. Family-Friendly: The data specifies that Giraffe is family-friendly, which implies that it is suitable and welcoming for customers of all age groups, including children. This characteristic also suggests that the establishment may offer additional amenities to cater to families, such as a kid-friendly menu, high chairs, or even a dedicated play area. The family-friendly nature of the coffee shop makes it an ideal destination for parents with children, as well as for gatherings of friends or relatives. 5. Nearby Location: Giraffe is located near a business called The Bakers. This could be a bakery, signifying that the area may be populated by other establishments centered around food and beverages. This neighboring location might be either beneficial or detrimental to Giraffe. On one hand, being close to a bakery could mean increased foot traffic and potential customers due to the shared target audience. On the other hand, this might also lead to increased competition for Giraffe, as customers might choose to visit The Bakers or other nearby food establishments that could offer compelling alternatives. In summary, Giraffe is a family-friendly coffee shop with a moderate price range, situated near a business called The Bakers. It possesses a disappointingly low customer rating of 1 out of 5, which is a critical aspect that requires further investigation and potentially some improvements on Giraffe's part to enhance its reputation and overall customer experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information: - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - Catalonia is an autonomous community of Spain, located on the northeastern extremity of the Iberian Peninsula. It is designated as a \\"nationality\\" by its Statute of Autonomy. Catalonia consists of four provinces: Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, and Tarragona. The capital and largest city is Barcelona, the second-most populated municipality in Spain and the core of the seventh-most populous urban area in the European Union. - Generalitat (, literally in English 'Generality') is the name of the systems of government of two of the present Spanish autonomous communities: Catalonia and Valencia. The term is also used for the government of the semi-autonomous \\"comarca\\" of Val d'Aran, the \\"Generalitat a l'Aran\\". - The functions of the President of the Generalitat de Catalunya have varied considerably over history , in parallel with the attributions of the Generalitat itself . - The Parliament of Catalonia is the unicameral legislature of Catalonia (autonomous community of Spain).

The list of presidents of the Generalitat de Catalunya refers to the individuals who have held the position of President in Catalonia's regional government, known as the Generalitat de Catalunya. Catalonia has a unique system of government within the Spanish framework and is designated as a \\"nationality\\" by its Statute of Autonomy. This autonomous status grants it a certain level of self-governance, allowing the region to have its institutions, such as the Parliament of Catalonia and the Generalitat de Catalunya. The President of the Generalitat de Catalunya serves as the head of the regional government and is elected by the Parliament of Catalonia. Their functions and attributions have evolved throughout history, alongside the Generalitat's attributions. The President plays a critical role in representing the Catalan government, managing the region's affairs, proposing regional legislation, and appointing members of the government's executive branch. Thus, the relationship between the list of presidents of the Generalitat de Catalunya and Catalonia is intrinsically linked to the region's autonomous political system.

One of them was a 19 year old dude, and he was kind of cute. But I never thought I would have this urge to you know… it was teenage and everything seemed new and exciting. So the second day, after having roamed all around Noida, we finally returned to our hotel and that guy accompanied me to my room. I asked him if he wants to come in as my parents were involved in the late night Sangeet rehearsals. He nodded gently and before I could know, we were cuddling and watching TV. I felt like a rebel, though it was the strangest and least expected thing I had done. Then he kissed me. Before I knew it I let him in my mouth …and he kept rolling his tongue on mine. It was my first kiss, and I don't regret it. The warmth of his mouth, the wetness of his lips and his breath felt like the only thing I ever wanted. I was a teen so please not judge. Sadly… before we could proceed, rest of our cousins called us to play Antakhshree with them. Never have we met since, but we often exchange messages on Facebook.

Translate to English","completion":"In any case, however, decisive measures must be taken within weeks or at most months to prevent the next round of bloody conflicts from breaking out in Afghanistan. The situation in Afghanistan is critical, and the urgency of taking immediate and decisive actions cannot be overstated. The aim of these measures should be to stabilize the country, provide support to its government and people, and prevent further escalation of violence and instability. There are several key steps that should be taken in the short term to address this crisis: 1. Diplomatic engagement: International and regional powers, such as the United States, China, Russia, Iran, and Pakistan, have an important role to play in resolving the current crisis. Concerted diplomatic efforts must be made to encourage dialogue between the Afghan government, the Taliban, and other warring factions. This should involve the establishment of a framework for negotiations and confidence-building measures. 2. Security assistance: Strengthening the Afghan security forces should be a priority to ensure that they can confront the different factions and maintain control over key parts of the country. This can be achieved by providing training, equipment, and financial support to the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). Additionally, international peacekeeping forces may need to remain in the country for a longer period to support the ANSF and maintain security. 3. Humanitarian aid and development cooperation: The Afghan population suffers from endemic poverty, high unemployment, and limited access to essential services, such as healthcare and education. Improving the living conditions of Afghans should be a key aspect of the international community's engagement in the country. Providing humanitarian aid, facilitating the delivery of essential services, and promoting socioeconomic development should be integral components of these efforts. 4. Counter-terrorism cooperation: Afghanistan remains a breeding ground for extremist groups, such as the Islamic State. International cooperation should be reinforced to share intelligence, disrupt terrorist networks, and prevent the spread of these threats beyond Afghanistan's border. This will require close collaboration between different actors, including law enforcement agencies, intelligence services, and the military. 5. Addressing the drug trafficking problem: Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opium, which fuels instability across the country and the region. Tackling this issue is crucial in order to undermine the funding sources of terrorist organizations and restore peace in Afghanistan. A comprehensive, long-term strategy is required, beginning with measures to disrupt drug production and traffic, followed by efforts to promote alternative livelihoods for Afghan farmers. By implementing these steps, the international community will be better placed to prevent the outbreak of another bloody conflict in Afghanistan. The goal should be a stable, secure, and prosperous Afghanistan that can provide safety and economic opportunities for its citizens while contributing to regional peace and stability. This is a complex and challenging task that requires commitment, cooperation, and sustained effort from all the parties involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Geraldine Anne \\"Gerry\\" Ferraro (August 26, 1935 - March 26, 2011) was an American attorney, a Democratic Party politician, and a member of the United States House of Representatives. In 1984, she was the first female vice presidential candidate representing a major American political party. Ferraro grew up in New York City and worked as a public school teacher before training as a lawyer. She joined the Queens County District Attorney's Office in 1974, heading the new Special Victims Bureau that dealt with sex crimes, child abuse, and domestic violence. In February 1996, Ferraro joined the high-visibility CNN political talk show Crossfire, as the co-host representing the \\"from the left\\" vantage. She kept her brassy, rapid-fire speech and New York accent intact, and her trial experience from her prosecutor days was a good fit for the program's format. She sparred effectively with \\"from the right\\" co-host Pat Buchanan, for whom she developed a personal liking. The show stayed strong in ratings for CNN, and the job was lucrative. She welcomed how the role \\"keeps me visible [and] keeps me extremely well informed on the issues.\\" At the start of 1998, Ferraro left Crossfire and ran for the Democratic nomination again in the 1998 United States Senate election in New York. The other candidates were Congressman Charles Schumer and New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green. She had done no fundraising, out of fear of conflict of interest with her Crossfire job, but was nonetheless immediately perceived as the front-runner. Indeed, December and January polls had her 25 percentage points ahead of Green in the race and even further ahead of Schumer. Unlike the previous campaigns, her family finances never became an issue. However, she lost ground during the summer, with Schumer catching up in the polls by early August and then soon passing her. Schumer, a tireless fundraiser, outspent her by a five-to-one margin, and Ferraro failed to establish a political image current with the times. In the September 15, 1998 primary, she was beaten soundly by Schumer by a 51 percent to 26 percent margin. Unlike 1992, the contest was not divisive, and Ferraro and third-place finisher Green endorsed Schumer at a unity breakfast the following day. Schumer would go on to decisively unseat D'Amato in the general election. The 1998 primary defeat brought an end to Ferraro's political career. The New York Times wrote at the time: \\"If Ms. Ferraro's rise was meteoric, her political career's denouement was protracted, often agonizing and, at first glance, baffling.\\" She still retained admirers, though. Anita Perez Ferguson, president of the National Women's Political Caucus, noted that female New York political figures in the past had been reluctant to enter the state's notoriously fierce primary races, and said: \\"This woman has probably been more of an opinion maker than most people sitting for six terms straight in the House of Representatives or Senate. Her attempts, and even her losses, have accomplished far beyond what others have accomplished by winning.\\" Was she popular on CNN?","completion":"Yes, Geraldine Ferraro was popular on CNN during her tenure as a co-host on the political talk show Crossfire. Her background as a prosecutor, combined with her quick and sharp communication style, New York accent, and ability to spar effectively with co-host Pat Buchanan, made her a strong presence on the show. As a result, Crossfire maintained strong ratings for CNN and became a lucrative job for her. Ferraro's role on the show not only kept her visible in the public eye but also allowed her to stay well informed on various political issues. Despite her political career ending after losing the 1998 Democratic primary for the United States Senate election in New York, Ferraro continued to be a respected and influential figure in politics. Her time on CNN's Crossfire was a significant part of her career and contributed to her visibility and popularity among viewers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Pascal Cotte said he has spent more than 10 years using the technology to analyse the painting. He claims the earlier portrait lies hidden underneath the surface of Leonardo's most celebrated artwork. A reconstruction shows another image of a sitter looking off to the side. The Louvre Museum has declined to comment on his claims because it \\"was not part of the scientific team\\". Instead of the famous, direct gaze of the painting which hangs in the Louvre Museum in Paris, the image of the sitter also shows no trace of her enigmatic smile, which has intrigued art lovers for more than 500 years. But Mr Cotte's claims are controversial and have divided opinion among Leonardo experts. Will Gompertz, Arts Editor I'm sceptical. It's perfectly common for an artist to overpaint an image as it is for a client who's commissioned that artist to ask for changes. So it's not surprising that there are those underpaintings on the Mona Lisa. The data that the technology generates is open to interpretation, which needs to be analysed and corroborated by the academic and curatorial community, and not just an individual. I think the Louvre's decision not to make a comment is telling. This is the world's most famous painting which, like a celebrity, always makes for a good story. But in this case I think caution is required. The scientist, who is the co-founder of Lumiere Technology in Paris, was given access to the painting in 2004 by the Louvre. He has pioneered a technique called Layer Amplification Method (LAM), which he used to analyse the Mona Lisa. It works by \\"projecting a series of intense lights\\" on to the painting, Mr Cotte said. A camera then takes measurements of the lights' reflections and from those measurements, Mr Cotte said he is able to reconstruct what has happened between the layers of the paint. The Mona Lisa has been the subject of several scientific examinations over more than half a century. More recent techniques include infrared inspections and multi-spectral scanning. But Mr Cotte has claimed his technique is able to penetrate more deeply into the painting. He said: \\"We can now analyse exactly what is happening inside the layers of the paint and we can peel like an onion all the layers of the painting. We can reconstruct all the chronology of the creation of the painting.\\" Leonardo is believed to have worked on the painting between 1503 and 1517 while working in Florence and later in France. There has long been debate about the Mona Lisa's identity. But for centuries, it has been widely believed that she is Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine silk merchant. But Mr Cotte has claimed his discoveries challenge that theory. He believes the image he has reconstructed underneath the surface of the painting is Leonardo's original Lisa, and that the portrait named Mona Lisa for more than 500 years is, in fact, a different woman. He said: \\"The results shatter many myths and alter our vision of Leonardo's masterpiece forever. \\"When I finished the reconstruction of Lisa Gherardini, I was in front of the portrait and she is totally different to Mona Lisa today. This is not the same woman.\\" He also claims to have found two more images under the surface of the painting - a shadowy outline of a portrait with a larger head and nose, bigger hands but smaller lips. And he says he has found another Madonna-style image with Leonardo's etchings of a pearl headdress. But Martin Kemp, Emeritus Professor of the History of Art at the University of Oxford, is not convinced. Professor Kemp said: \\"They [Cotte's images] are ingenious in showing what Leonardo may have been thinking about. But the idea that there is that picture as it were hiding underneath the surface is untenable. \\"I do not think there are these discrete stages which represent different portraits. I see it as more or less a continuous process of evolution. I am absolutely convinced that the Mona Lisa is Lisa. \\" Art historian Andrew Graham-Dixon has made a new BBC documentary called The Secrets of the Mona Lisa, studying historical documents linked to the painting alongside Mr Cotte's scientific findings. Mr Graham-Dixon said: \\"I have no doubt that this is definitely one of the stories of the century. \\"There will probably be some reluctance on the part of the authorities at the Louvre in changing the title of the painting because that's what we're talking about - it's goodbye Mona Lisa, she is somebody else.\\" Mr Cotte announced the findings of his latest research at a press conference in Shanghai on Tuesday. They will be included in an exhibition, Da Vinci - The Genius, which features displays of his research on the Mona Lisa over the last 11 years. The show has travelled around the world and opens in Shanghai this week. The Secrets of the Mona Lisa is on BBC Two at 21:00 GMT on 9 December.

In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.The whale eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals.

A year after dumping Roger Federer out of the second round at Wimbledon he sent Ernests Gulbis packing at the same stage. The world No 86 perhaps thought a posting on court 12 might keep him below the radar. But matches involving Gulbis are rarely quiet. And upsetting the 12th seed ensures he will inflate his reputation so long as he keeps his footing on grass. This was a performance of domination, a sustained beating that rarely, if ever, looked like letting up. He ultimately saw off the Latvian 6-4, 6-3, 7-6. Throwback: Stakhovsky celebrating his victory over","completion":"Roger Federer in the second round at Wimbledon in 2013. Ukrainian tennis player Sergiy Stakhovsky has earned a reputation for causing upsets on the grand stage, particularly at Wimbledon. Following his shock victory over Roger Federer in the second round in 2013, he once again caused a stir by defeating 12th seed Ernests Gulbis in the second round at the All England Club in 2014. Stakhovsky, who was ranked No. 86 in the world at the time, may have believed that playing on the less prominent Court 12 would help him avoid too much attention. However, matches featuring the enigmatic Gulbis are seldom uneventful, and the Ukrainian's victory only served to further enhance his burgeoning reputation, especially when it comes to performing on grass courts. Throughout the match, Stakhovsky appeared to be in complete control, dominating his higher-ranked opponent in a display of powerful and aggressive tennis. Gulbis, known for his mercurial talent and often fiery temperament, struggled to find his rhythm and was unable to counter the relentless pressure applied by Stakhovsky. The final score read 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 in the Ukrainian's favor, in what many considered a significant upset. Stakhovsky's success in toppling top-ranked players at Wimbledon highlights his ability to rise to the occasion on the sport's biggest stages. His fearlessness and determination, combined with his undeniable natural talent, make him a dangerous opponent, particularly in the early rounds of Grand Slam events when higher-ranked players may still be finding their form. Gulbis, on the other hand, demonstrated that despite his immense natural ability and impressive shot-making skills, consistency and mental fortitude remain areas of concern in his game. While undoubtedly a gifted player, the Latvian's inability to maintain focus and perform at his best during crunch moments has often cost him dearly when it matters most. This match served as a clear reminder of the unpredictability of tennis. On any given day, a lower-ranked player can overcome a more established rival, particularly in Grand Slam events where the pressure and intensity can be overwhelming. Stakhovsky's victory over Gulbis, much like his famous win against Federer the year before, proved that there are no guaranteed victories in tennis, and every match must be approached with the utmost concentration and commitment. In conclusion, Sergiy Stakhovsky's 2014 Wimbledon second-round victory over Ernests Gulbis was yet another example of the Ukrainian's ability to cause major upsets in Grand Slam tournaments. His fearless and aggressive style of play, combined with a never-say-die attitude, make him a formidable opponent, particularly on grass courts. Meanwhile, Gulbis must continue to work on maintaining consistency and mental strength if he is to deliver on his immense potential and challenge for major honors in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The beleaguered retailer said that it has identified about 100 stores that are no longer turning a profit, and the majority of those locations will be shuttered soon. The company said it would post of a list of the stores to close later on Thursday, reports the Wall Street Journal. Sears lost 424 million, or 3.93 per share, for the period ended May 5, per the AP. Revenue tumbled more than 30%, with store closings already underway contributing to almost two thirds of the decline. Sales at stores open at least a year, a key gauge of a retailer's health, tumbled 11.9%. The one-time powerhouse retailer that survived two world wars and the Great Depression has been calving off pieces of itself as it burns through money. Kenmore, the retailer's appliance brand, became the latest potential sale after ESL Investments, the company's largest shareholder, headed by Sears Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, said it might be interested in buying it. Lampert, who combined Sears and Kmart in 2005 after helping to bring the latter out of bankruptcy, has long pledged to save the famed retailer, which started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. Article:","completion":"Title: Sears Plans to Close 72 Stores as Retail Giant's Sales and Losses Grow Sears, the once-powerhouse retailer, has announced plans to close another 72 stores as it continues to struggle with plummeting sales and growing losses. The company has identified approximately 100 stores that are no longer profitable, and the majority of these will be closed soon, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The closure of these stores is the latest indication of the woes that have plagued Sears for years, as it fails to maintain a presence in the challenging retail landscape. Sears reported a loss of 424 million, or 3.93 per share, for the period ended May 5. Revenue declined by more than 30%, with store closings already underway contributing to nearly two-thirds of this decline. Sales at stores open for at least a year, an important metric for a retailer's health, plunged 11.9%. These losses come even as the company has been selling off and divesting assets in an effort to stay afloat. Sears once thrived as a powerhouse retailer, surviving two world wars and the Great Depression. It began in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business and became a cornerstone of American retail. In 2005, the company merged with Kmart under the leadership of Edward Lampert, CEO and chairman of Sears as well as the founder of ESL Investments, Sears' largest shareholder. At the time, Kmart was coming out of bankruptcy, and Lampert promised to save the storied brand. Despite Lampert's ambitions, Sears has continued to struggle, and the company has been forced to sell off assets in order to stay in business. The latest potential sale involves Kenmore, the retailer's appliance brand, which may be of interest to ESL Investments. However, it remains uncertain whether any sale of Kenmore would be enough to stop the bleeding and save the company. The struggles of Sears reflect the broader challenges facing the retail industry, which has been battered by the rise of e-commerce. The popularity of online shopping has caused a significant decrease in foot traffic at malls and brick-and-mortar stores, leaving many retailers scrambling to adjust their business models in order to remain viable. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has only amplified these challenges, as many shoppers have turned even more to online options to meet their needs. Despite its ongoing woes, Sears once represented a unique and important piece of American retail history. As the company continues to take painful steps to combat its losses, the question remains: Can Sears ultimately be saved, and what might that look like in a rapidly evolving retail landscape? In this period of uncertainty, one thing is clear: Sears' future depends on its ability to adapt and innovate in the face of these monumental challenges. With the upcoming closure of these 72 stores, the company is trimming the fat from its operations, but only time will tell if this is enough to turn around its fortunes or if the retail giant is ultimately destined for the history books."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Earnings Not Yet a Viral Sensation When Facebook Inc. boss Mark Zuckerberg announced first-quarter results, he didn't break the news with a Facebook post. He stuck with an old-fashioned news release. Across the U.S., earnings season came and went with few signs that companies are taking advantage of the Securities and Exchange Commission's green light to tweet or post market-moving information. On April 2, the SEC announced that companies \\"can use social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter to announce key information…so long as investors have been alerted about which social media will be used to disseminate such information.\\" Since then, only about a dozen firms have said they might break news on Facebook, Twitter and the like. And few of those companies make much noise online. Nielsen Holdings NV had fewer than 70 followers on its investor-relations department's Twitter account when the tracker of what consumers watch and buy said it might disclose financial information with tweets on that account. A Nielsen spokeswoman declined to comment. A Facebook spokesman said the company plans to \\"disseminate information as broadly as possible, and that will include using Facebook.\\" He wouldn't say when that would begin or if Facebook will ever use its own site as the primary place to report earnings. On Wednesday, Zillow Inc. took questions submitted via Facebook and Twitter during the real-estate website's earnings-related conference call. Zillow got questions from 11 accounts, mostly using tweets, according to a company spokeswoman. Some securities lawyers say the tepid response shows some corporate executives still are concerned they might get in trouble because of their tweets. One reason: The SEC's guidance was more general than specific, leaving the agency wiggle room to pursue enforcement action. As companies and their lawyers dug into an eight-page report laying out the agency's logic, some were bothered by the sentence, \\"Every case must be evaluated on its own facts.\\" The SEC also said that social-media channels need to clear the same hurdle of \\"broad and non-exclusionary distribution to the public\\" as other media in order to comply with the 13-year-old rule known as Regulation Fair Disclosure. Amy Goodman, a partner at law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, says the agency's guidance on the use of Facebook and Twitter suggests that companies \\"could still be vulnerable to enforcement action if that channel has very few followers and it's used as the sole means\\" to disclose financial information. The SEC has taken 13 enforcement actions against companies and executives for alleged earnings leaks and other rule breaches of Reg. FD, according to an analysis by Stanford University law professor Joseph Grundfest. One way to land in hot water is by tipping favored analysts to market-moving information. The same thing could happen now if a company's tweets are read by just a few investors. \\"I don't think the SEC is trying to trap people,\\" says Steve Quinlivan, a lawyer at Leonard, Street and Deinard PA in Minneapolis. \\"But if they think somebody crossed the line, they're not going to wait five minutes to bring an enforcement action.\\" The SEC declined to comment on the minimum number of Twitter followers needed for a company to safely tweet its earnings. \\"We do not comment on specific situations,\\" Lona Nallengara, acting director of the SEC's corporation-finance division, wrote in an email to The Wall Street Journal. In 2008, the SEC issued guidelines on how Reg. FD applies to corporate websites. Ms. Nallengara says companies \\"were able to figure out how to disclose information on their websites using our 2008 guidance,\\" and so \\"we believe they should be able to do the same with social media\\" using last month's announcement. For now, though, \\"companies are still taking a wait-and-see approach,\\" says Broc Romanek, editor of TheCorporateCounsel.net, a website for corporate lawyers. Last month's announcement by the SEC followed an investigation into a post by Netflix Inc. Chief Executive Reed Hastings on his personal Facebook page. In December, the SEC warned the streaming-video company that the agency intended to take enforcement action over the posting, where Mr. Hastings said monthly online viewing had surpassed a billion hours. Some senior SEC officials had misgivings about the potential Netflix lawsuit, and at least one of the agency's five commissioners questioned whether the agency should punish the company when there were no clear and up-to-date guidelines, no evidence the company acted in bad faith and no apparent harm to investors, people familiar with the probe say. The concerns were exacerbated when Mr. Grundfest, a former SEC commissioner, published a paper saying the agency faced a \\"significant risk\\" of losing to Netflix. Meanwhile, Netflix refused to enter settlement talks, arguing it had done nothing wrong, said the people familiar with the probe. George Canellos, the SEC's acting enforcement director at the time, recommended that the agency resolve the matter with a report that sets out the agency's thinking without taking enforcement action. In contrast to the SEC's typical practice, last month's announcement on the use of social media was made without any input from Netflix or a heads-up to the company, people close to the probe say.

You might watch and laugh when your dog chases its tail because it looks cute. But did you know that, even though it might appear like a fun game, it could mean your pet is sick? Researchers have found that if a dog runs after its tail, chases cars and barks at flies that are not there, it may have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD, ). In fact, OCD is even more common among humans. The symptoms are varied: some people check and recheck the locks before they go out; others are extremely afraid of germs and have to wash their hands many times a day. English soccer star David Beckham, for example, cannot stand odd numbers of items in his fridge. So if he has three cans of drink he will throw one out, according to his wife Victoria. Hoping to better understand OCD in humans, a team of scientists from the University of Helsinki, Finland, studied 368 dogs, including those that chase their tail for several hours daily or a few times a month, according to Sciencedaily.com. They also examined dogs that had never chased their tails. Scientists took the dogs' blood sample and asked their owners some questions about their pets' daily life. Findings showed that among all kinds of dogs, bull terriers and German shepherds were likely to chase their tails, which led scientists to believe that genes can cause OCD. Diet also plays a part. It was found that dogs that eat food with certain vitamins and minerals chased their tails less. \\"Interestingly, there are indications that vitamins and minerals are helpful in human OCD treatment,\\" said researcher Katriina Tiira. Moreover, tail-chasing is often found among dogs that were separated from their mothers too early or ones that didn't receive enough care. They are also more likely to turn out to be shyer and more afraid of loud noises at a young age. The study can help us understand the causes of OCD in humans. \\"Dogs share the same environment with humans, and large animals are physiologically close to humans,\\" said Hannes Lohi, leader...

India's general election, the largest democratic exercise in history, begins Monday. Voters will elect 543 members to the lower house of parliament, which will then select the country's next prime minister. Here are 11 things you need to know about the world's biggest election: 1. Its massive scale. More than 814 million voters are eligible to cast ballots over the next month to elect the lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha, up from 713 million voters in 2009. The Indian voting pool is larger than the total populations of the United States and Western Europe combined. Given the infrastructure in India, an election of this scale can't be done in a day. Voting will take place in nine blocks over the next five weeks, to allow election authorities to tackle the daunting logistics of operating 930,000 polling stations. The vote counting will be carried out and concluded on May 16. The figure is second only to the 7 billion spent in the 2012 OPTIONS: - BJP presidential race, the world's most expensive election. - India presidential race, the world's most expensive election. - Indian presidential race, the world's most expensive election. - Lok Sabha presidential race, the world's most expensive election. - Narendra Modi presidential race, the world's most expensive election. - United States presidential race, the world's most expensive election. - Western Europe presidential race, the world's most expensive election. - World presidential race, the world's most expensive election.","completion":"2. Its cost. The 2019 Indian general election is the second most expensive election in the world, with around 7 billion being spent during the electoral process. The figure is second only to the 7 billion spent in the 2012 United States presidential race, the world's most expensive election. The high cost of the Indian elections can be attributed to the massive scale, extensive campaigning, advertising, and logistics that are necessary to facilitate the voting process across the country. 3. Key political parties. The two main political parties in India are the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The INC, which is led by Rahul Gandhi, has historically played a central role in Indian politics. The BJP, on the other hand, is led by incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and has gained popularity over the past decade, particularly among the middle class and urban populations. 4. Coalition politics. It is common for political parties in India to form coalitions in order to gain a majority in the Lok Sabha. Currently, the ruling alliance is the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the BJP, while the main opposition alliance is the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) led by the INC. 5. Key issues. The primary issues in this election include job creation, economic growth, national security, and women's safety. Both the ruling BJP and the opposition INC have laid out their respective agendas and outlined their plans to address these critical areas. 6. Digital campaigning. Given the increasing importance of social media and digital platforms, both major parties have invested significantly in online advertising and communication strategies. This has led to a surge in the use of platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp for political messaging and engagement with the electorate. 7. Security concerns. Ensuring the safety of voters and election officials during the five-week voting period remains a significant challenge for Indian authorities. Thousands of security forces have been deployed across the country to maintain law and order and to prevent any disturbances. 8. Voting process. India uses electronic voting machines (EVMs) to record votes. This technology has been in use since 1999 and has been praised for its efficiency and accuracy. However, concerns about the possibility of tampering have arisen on occasion. In response, Indian authorities have introduced the Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT), which allows voters to verify their votes on a printed slip before it is stored in a sealed container. 9. International observers. As in previous years, the Indian general election has attracted the attention of election observers from various countries and international organizations. These observers monitor the electoral process to ensure that it is free, fair, and transparent. 10. Potential outcomes. Analysts predict that the BJP and its NDA coalition partners may win a majority of seats, enabling Narendra Modi to continue as Prime Minister. However, a strong performance by the INC and the UPA coalition cannot be ruled out, potentially leading to a negotiated outcome and the formation of a new government. 11. Impact on India's future. The outcome of the 2019 Indian general election will have significant implications for the country's domestic and foreign policies, as well as its economy. The new government's approach to issues such as job creation, economic growth, national security, and women's safety will be of critical importance in shaping India's future in the coming years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the next sentence.A 20-minute drive from Kiev takes you to a neighborhood that feels more like Beverly Hills than central Ukraine. In a quiet oasis, huge mansions sit on lush lawns behind gilded gates. Private security guards stand watch over quiet, tree-lined streets. You'd never know you're in a country in the midst of a violent conflict, with near daily reports of intense battles killing soldiers, pro-Russian separatists, and civilians -- including children.

The correct answer is Ukraine's supporters, as the paragraph focuses on the violent conflict in Ukraine and the new rich living in those mansions away from the actual crisis. This option fits in the context of the country in crisis by showing how people are supporting Ukraine during this difficult time. Incorrect options: - Beverly Hills's supporters: The comparison to Beverly Hills is being used to describe the wealthy neighborhood in Ukraine — it is not the main subject and not related to the conflict. - Forbes's supporters: There is no mention of Forbes in the paragraph and it does not relate to the conflict in Ukraine. - Kiev's supporters: Although the mansions are near Kiev, mentioning solely Kiev supporters doesn't capture the broader effort to support the country during the crisis. - Soviet Union's supporters: The paragraph talks about the period after the Soviet Union fell and the new rich emerging in Ukraine. Mentioning the Soviet Union's supporters doesn't fit the context of the modern crisis. - pro-Russian's supporters: The paragraph states that pro-Russian separatists are involved in the violent conflict.

It can be used to convey a lot of information very quickly, or to imply either energy or chaos. Fast cutting is also frequently used when shooting dialogue between two or more characters, changing the viewer's perspective to either focus on the reaction of another character's dialog, or to bring to attention the non-verbal actions of the speaking character. - Michael Benjamin Bay (born February 17, 1965) is an American filmmaker known for directing and producing big-budget action films characterized by fast cutting, stylistic visuals and extensive use of special effects, including frequent depictions of explosions. His films, which include \\"Armageddon\\" (1998), \\"Pearl Harbor\\" (2001) and the \\"Transformers\\" film series (2007present), have grossed over worldwide. He is co-founder of commercial production house The Institute, a.k.a. The Institute for the Development of Enhanced Perceptual Awareness.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. - A prequel is a literary, dramatic, or filmic work whose story precedes that of a previous work, by focusing on events that occur before the original narrative. A prequel is a work that forms part of a back-story to the preceding work. - A book series is a sequence of books having certain characteristics in common that are formally identified together as a group. Book series can be organized in different ways, such as written by the same author, or marketed as a group by their publisher. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Transformers : Ghosts of Yesterday is a science fiction novel written by Alan Dean Foster . Transformers : Ghosts of Yesterday is a prequel to the Michael Bay Transformers film . It is based on a story by David Cian . - An explosion is a rapid increase in volume and release of energy in an extreme manner, usually with the generation of high temperatures and the release of gases. Supersonic explosions created by high explosives are known as detonations and travel via supersonic shock waves. Subsonic explosions are created by low explosives through a slower burning process known as deflagration. When caused by a man-made device such as an exploding rocket or firework, the audible component of an explosion is referred to as its \\"report\\" (which can also be used as a verb, e.g., \\"the rocket reported loudly upon impact\\".) - Digital Domain is an American visual effects and digital production company based in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California. The company is known for creating digital imagery for feature films, advertising and games, from its locations in California and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, including its own virtual production studio. - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - Alan Dean Foster (born November 18, 1946) is an American writer of fantasy and science fiction, a prolific creator of and contributor to book series as well as the author of more than 20 standalone novels. He is especially prolific in his novelizations of film scripts. - A novelization (or novelisation) is a derivative novel that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a film, TV series, comic strip or video game. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the advent of home video, but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film's script and on a tight deadline. - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - Innovation can be defined simply as a \\"new idea, device, or method\\". However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term \\"innovation\\" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that \\"breaks into\\" the market or society. It is related to, but not the same as, invention. Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process. The exnovation is the opposite of innovation. - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. - Special effects (often abbreviated as SFX, SPFX, or simply FX) are illusions or visual tricks used in the film, television, theatre, video game, and simulator industries to simulate the imagined events in a story or virtual world. - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Platinum Dunes is an American production company created in November 2001 by filmmakers Michael Bay, Brad Fuller, and Andrew Form. The company specializes in horror films. - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") - Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \\"extraterrestrial\\" or \\"alien\\"), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.

She calls for help. but recovers and makes it back to land. As she senses the Wolf watching her, she is discovered by a woodsman, Peter, who scolds her for being foolish. As they walk back, Peter asks Linet why she can't stay home and be a good little girl. Linet answers how good little girls hardly ever see the world (Lost in the Woods). When they arrive at the house, Lady Jean raises an eyebrow at Linet's disheveled condition. Linet apologizes, but tells her mother how she came close to actually seeing an elf; and if she doesn't look, then she'll never know for sure. As Lady Jean sends her inside to change, Peter comments to her how Linet is growing up and shows no fear. They then talk about how when her husband, Lord Percival, was in the castle, there was no danger. But since Percival's disappearance, his evil twin brother, Lord Godfrey, has taken over, and no one in the castle is safe, which is why Jean and Linet live in the country. As Jean stands, she suddenly sees Godfrey approaching, and Peter leaves. Godfrey notes to Jean that today was the day her husband went off to war, and it has been seven years since, meaning that she is legally free to remarry. He sternly implores that it is the right thing for Jean to marry him, but Jean flatly refuses and explains she still loves Percival. Godfrey wonders, as Percival's exact twin, how Jean could not love him when it is clear she doesn't. He offers her riches and beauty, by proposing to enable her to resume her role as lady of the castle, but she refuses. Godfrey loudly proclaims that, as far as he is concerned, she is the only candidate for lady of the castle, meaning that she WILL be his wife.

Which sister had fewer clotting factors in the blood? Two twin sisters were taken to the doctor's office by their parents. It turned out that Mary had hemophilia while Ann didn't have any blood disease. Hint: Hemophilia is the name of a group of hereditary diseases that affect the body's ability to control blood clotting. Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood.

A detailed description of Las Meninas, which provides the identification of several of the figures, was published by Antonio Palomino (\\"the Giorgio Vasari of the Spanish Golden Age\\") in 1724. Examination under infrared light reveals minor pentimenti, that is, there are traces of earlier working that the artist himself later altered. For example, at first Velázquez's own head inclined to his right rather than his left.The painting has been cut down on both the left and right sides. It was damaged in the fire that destroyed the Alcázar in 1734, and was restored by court painter Juan García de Miranda (1677–1749). The left cheek of the Infanta was almost completely repainted to compensate for a substantial loss of pigment. After its rescue from the fire, the painting was inventoried as part of the royal collection in 1747–48, and the Infanta was misidentified as Maria Theresa, Margaret Theresa's older half-sister, an error that was repeated when the painting was inventoried at the new Madrid Royal Palace in 1772. A 1794 inventory reverted to a version of the earlier title, The Family of Philip IV, which was repeated in the records of 1814. The painting entered the collection of the Museo del Prado on its foundation in 1819. In 1843, the Prado catalogue listed the work for the first time as Las Meninas.In recent years, the picture has suffered a loss of texture and hue. Due to exposure to pollution and crowds of visitors, the once-vivid contrasts between blue and white pigments in the costumes of the meninas have faded. It was last cleaned in 1984 under the supervision of the American conservator John Brealey, to remove a \\"yellow veil\\" of dust that had gathered since the previous restoration in the 19th century. The cleaning provoked, according to the art historian Federico Zeri, \\"furious protests, not because the picture had been damaged in any way, but because it looked different\\".

Article: Let Children Roam Free Everyone agrees that playing outside keeps children thinner. The loss of opportunities for outdoor play is one of the main causes of childhood obesity. What is more remarkable is the growing evidence that children's mental health and emotional well-being are enhanced by contact with the outdoors, and that the restorative effect appears to be strongest in natural settings. Researchers are convinced of the depth of the connection between children's well-being and the environment, claiming that contact with nature may be as important to children as good nutrition and adequate sleep. But now children seem to get less touch with outdoor activities. The root causes of the dramatic loss of children's freedom lie in changes to the very fabric of their lives over the last 30 years or so. The growth in road traffic, alongside poor town planning and shifts in the make-up and daily rhythms of families and communities, have left children with fewer outdoor places to go. These changes coincided with the \\"culture of fear\\": a generalized anxiety about all imaginary kinds of threats, even though children are statistically safer from harm now than at any point in human history. These physical, economic and social changes and fears have been made use of by manufactures and advertisers, whose products and messages both reinforce the logic of keeping children virtual prisoners, and force us to compensate them in the only way our cash-rich, time-poor society seems to know: by spending money on them. Government must bear some of the blame for keeping children prisoners indoor, through their promotion of planning policies that favour cars over communities and profit over people. The real planning crimes lie in housing companies occupying attractive parks and green spaces, and in town plans that force families to depend largely on their cars. There is no doubt that traffic danger, unlike stranger danger, is a real threat to children and a constant worry for parents. Around 100 child pedestrians are killed...

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the youngest Martha could have been when she died? If the pigeon became alert, it would often stretch out its head and neck in line with its body and tail, then nod its head in a circular pattern. When aggravated by another pigeon, it raised its wings threateningly, but passenger pigeons almost never actually fought. The pigeon bathed in shallow water, and afterwards lay on each side in turn and raised the opposite wing to dry it.The passenger pigeon drank at least once a day, typically at dawn, by fully inserting its bill into lakes, small ponds, and streams. Pigeons were seen perching on top of each other to access water, and if necessary, the species could alight on open water to drink. One of the primary causes of natural mortality was the weather, and every spring many individuals froze to death after migrating north too early. In captivity, a passenger pigeon was capable of living at least 15 years; Martha, the last known living passenger pigeon, was at least 17 and possibly as old as 29 when she died. It is undocumented how long a wild pigeon lived.The bird is believed to have played a significant ecological role in the composition of pre-Columbian forests of eastern North America. For instance, while the passenger pigeon was extant, forests were dominated by white oaks. This species germinated in the fall, therefore making its seeds almost useless as a food source during the spring breeding season, while red oaks produced acorns during the spring, which were devoured by the pigeons. The absence of the passenger pigeon's seed consumption may have contributed to the modern dominance of red oaks. Due to the immense amount of dung present at roosting sites, few plants grew for years after the pigeons left. Also, the accumulation of flammable debris (such as limbs broken from trees and foliage killed by excrement) at these sites may have increased both the frequency and intensity of forest fires, which would have favored fire-tolerant species, such as bur oaks, black oaks, and white oaks over less fire-tolerant species, such as red oaks, thus helping to...

New FDA rules are helping ensure that we get the protection we pay for, and with skin cancer on the rise (one in five Americans will develop skin cancer in the course of a lifetime), these changes can't come soon enough. Key fixes: Sunscreens will be labeled \\"water resistant\\" (as opposed to waterproof or sweatproof); they can no longer be called \\"sunblocks\\" (as it overstates their effectiveness); and they can no longer claim to provide instant sun protection or to last more than two hours without reapplication. On top of that, sunscreens can be labeled \\"broad spectrum\\" only if they protect equally against UVB (the main culprit of skin cancer) and UVA rays, which cause aging. Unfortunately, the changes won't be on store shelves this summer. Last week the FDA announced it is giving manufacturers six additional months from their original deadline to meet the new requirements. And even with these changes, most of us still have questions. Here are the ones you sent to us, answered by our dermatologists. How much sunscreen do I really need to put on? Anytime you're planning to be outdoors, go with an SPF of at least 30 (45 for a little extra insurance) and put plenty on. The rule of thumb is 1 ounce (the size of a shot glass) on your body, and a teaspoon for your face, but derms advise being even more generous. Reapply every two hours -- more often if you're in and out of the water. Health.com: 7 ways you're aging your skin. Are there any sunscreens good for oily skin? Yes. What you want is an oil-free mineral block in an ultralight gel or liquid. \\"Mineral sunscreens help mask redness, and because they reflect UV light, they help keep your skin surface cooler,\\" Rodan notes. While you're at it, keep your skin clean by always washing your face after working up a sweat outdoors: Summer breakouts often have more to do with sweating than wearing sunscreen. How do I know if I'm spraying on enough sunscreen? I feel like it all blows away! Spray sunscreens aren't as powerful as lotions, so the trick is to look for one labeled \\"continuous spray\\" (no need to pump; it keeps spraying as long as your finger stays on the button) and apply two coats -- not one -- every hour, Rodan says. What should I look for in a sunscreen if I have sensitive skin? All the dermatologists we interviewed recommend mineral-based or physical sunscreens made with micronized titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide instead of chemical sunscreens because they're less likely to irritate sensitive skin. Plus, the latest mineral sunscreens give the gentle protection of a physical sunscreen without leaving a white cast.Health.com: Short-and-sweet skin advice. Is sunscreen really necessary for lips? Absolutely. In the past, it wasn't unusual for lip products to come with little or no SPF. Thankfully, many companies have upped the level of protection in lip balms. That's critical because skin cancers on the lower lip, in particular, are especially aggressive. \\"These cancers are dangerous, as they're more likely to spread,\\" explains Jeremy Green, M.D., a Miami dermatologist. What's the easiest way to stay protected when I'm working out? Dab an SPF (of at least 30) stick or gel on your face, neck, and chest, and on hot spots like shoulders and the backs of your hands. \\"The non-tacky sticks are great because they really stay put,\\" says Washington, D.C.--based dermatologist Dr. Tina Alster. For the rest of your body, use a sunscreen spray. If you're swimming or perspiring a lot, opt for one of the new formulas that are marked \\"water resistant\\" for up to 40 or 80 minutes. Health.com: Fun-in-the-sun workout. I hate reapplying! Can I throw on a long-sleeved T-shirt instead at the beach? \\"Most cotton shirts are no substitute for sunscreen,\\" Rodan says. \\"At best, they give you a UPF (ultraviolet protection factor, the equivalent of SPF for clothing) of 8 -- and if they get wet, that devolves to UPF 2.\\" Instead, invest in a long-sleeved rash guard -- a type of shirt made up of a spandex and nylon mix that was originally used for water sports, but is now popular as a sun protector. Look for one with a UPF rating of 50+. \\"Those things are lifesavers -- total protection, even when wet,\\" Alster says. Likewise, your sun hat should be floppy, wide-brimmed, and made from a tightly woven material. Will my SPF foundation do the trick for workdays? \\"You'd have to slap on a heck of a lot to make it truly effective,\\" Green says. A better idea: Layer.

What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"This article talks about new rules for sunscreen labels and suggests ways to choose and use sunscreen effectively. Some key points are: 1. Sunscreens need to be water resistant, not claim to be sunblocks or have instant protection. 2. Look for sunscreen labeled \\"broad spectrum\\" to protect against both UVB and UVA rays. 3. Apply at least 1 ounce (a shot glass-sized amount) to your body and a teaspoon for your face every two hours. 4. There are oil-free sunscreens for oily skin, and some mineral sunscreens can help with redness. 5. For sensitive skin, choose sunscreens with micronized titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide. 6. Protect your lips with lip balms containing SPF. Skin cancers on the lower lip can be particularly aggressive. 7. Reapply sunscreen after swimming, sweating or working out. 8. Cotton shirts don't offer much sun protection, so investing in a long-sleeved rash guard with UPF 50+ is recommended for the beach. 9.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. William Hogarth was born at Bartholomew Close in London to Richard Hogarth, a poor Latin school teacher and textbook writer, and Anne Gibbons. In his youth he was apprenticed to the engraver Ellis Gamble in Leicester Fields, where he learned to engrave trade cards and similar products. Young Hogarth also took a lively interest in the street life of the metropolis and the London fairs, and amused himself by sketching the characters he saw. Around the same time, his father, who had opened an unsuccessful Latin-speaking coffee house at St John's Gate, was imprisoned for debt in Fleet Prison for five years. In 1731 Hogarth completed the earliest of his series of moral works, a body of work that led to significant recognition. The collection of six scenes was entitled A Harlot's Progress and appeared first as paintings (now lost) before being published as engravings. A Harlot's Progress depicts the fate of a country girl who begins prostituting - the six scenes are chronological, starting with a meeting with a bawd and ending with a funeral ceremony that follows the character's death from venereal disease. The inaugural series was an immediate success and was followed in 1733-1735 by the sequel A Rake's Progress. The second instalment consisted of eight pictures that depicted the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant, who spends all of his money on luxurious living, services from prostitutes, and gambling - the character's life ultimately ends in Bethlem Royal Hospital. The original paintings of A Harlot's Progress were destroyed in the fire at Fonthill House in 1755; the oil paintings of A Rake's Progress (1733-34) are displayed in the gallery room at Sir John Soane's Museum, London, UK. When the success of A Harlot's Progress and A Rake's Progress resulted in numerous pirated reproductions by unscrupulous printsellers, Hogarth lobbied in parliament for greater legal control over the reproduction of his and other artists' work. The result was the Engravers' Copyright Act (known as 'Hogarth's Act'), which became law on 25 June 1735 and was the first copyright law to deal with visual works as well as the first to recognize the authorial rights of an individual artist.

While Reznor—the only official member until adding Atticus Ross in 2016—controls its creative and musical direction in the studio, the touring band performs different arrangements of the songs. In addition to regular concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as Woodstock '94, Lollapalooza 1991 and 2008, and many other one-off performances including the MTV Video Music Awards. Prior to their 2013 tour, the band had played 938 gigs.Nine Inch Nails' live performances contrast with its in-studio counterpart. Reznor writes and performs nearly all Nine Inch Nails studio material, with occasional instrumental and vocal contributions from others artists. However, Reznor has typically assembled groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for tours and other live performances. Keyboardist Alessandro Cortini said that \\"if you see the show and you're used to the CDs it's pretty clear that the studio entity is different from the live entity\\".The only constant member of the live band is Reznor.

Faith, 6, and Matthew and Michael, both 4, belong to Jamie and Dan Felice, a couple who struggled to have children before being matched with a donor through a group that collects unused frozen embryos. They received six embryos. Two pregnancies later, their family is complete. \\"I was terrified at 20 to birth a child, but once I found the man of my dreams and wanted to have kids and wanted to create a child together like most couples, I wasn't afraid anymore,\\" said Jamie Felice, 47, who lives in Crystal Lake. But after 10 attempts at artificial insemination and four unsuccessful rounds of in vitro fertilization, Jamie Felice was nearly 40, pumped full of hormones and ready to give up. Then she stumbled across an embryo donation organization. \\"We thought, how cool is this?\\" she said. \\"I still get to carry the baby and experience pregnancy and how cool is it to connect on that?\\" More than 600,000 frozen embryos are in storage in the United States, and embryo donation is a growing industry, with nearly 2,000 frozen embryos used in conception attempts in 2014, according to experts. While many people are hesitant to get pregnant using donated embryos, the Felices are thrilled with their family. Their home is filled with the thumping of little feet racing across the hardwood floors. On a recent weeknight, Matthew squealed as he caught the family cat, who defeatedly hung from his arms like a white, fluffy rag doll. In his haste, Matthew crashed into Faith, who ran to her mother with tears streaking down her pink cheeks and crawled into her lap for comfort. Jamie and Dan Felice, a Crystal Lake couple who struggled to have children, adopted donated frozen embryos to get pregnant with their daughter Faith and twin boys Michael and Matthew. (Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) (Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) \\"It obviously has its tough times, like when they're running around and chasing the cat, but it's amazing, you love them so much,\\" Jamie Felice said as she smiled at the little girl in her arms. Her husband agreed, saying that this experience is the closest thing to having biological children and that he often forgets they're not his own. \\"You're not missing out on any part, except in your head you know they're not biologically yours and you just move on,\\" said Dan Felice, 51. \\"To me it is the closest thing to the real thing. You have them and they're yours. You don't even think twice. You would instantly die for them.\\" Embryo donation is possible because of IVF, which began in 1978 and costs about 10,000 to 15,000 for a single IVF cycle in the U.S., depending on insurance coverage, patient characteristics and treatment centers, according to the website for the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, which represents the majority of IVF clinics in the U.S. When a client undergoes IVF, clinics create dozens of embryos and pick the best ones to use. The leftover embryos are typically kept in frozen storage, donated to medical research or discarded, experts said. Nonprofit organizations like Nightlight Christian Adoptions, the one used by the Felices, and the National Embryo Donation Center help match donors to recipients around the nation. Some hospitals and fertility centers also have programs that match their patients with the donated embryos from people who have used their services for IVF. Participating in an embryo donation program is less expensive than undergoing an IVF cycle and also less expensive than using a donor egg. The Felices paid about 2,000 for their four IVF cycles because their insurance covered the majority of the costs. This total does not include the copays for fertility drugs, blood draws, ultrasounds and other expenses. They paid 8,000, plus an additional 2,000 for a home study, to Snowflakes Embryo Adoption and Donation, a program through Nightlight. However, many couples balk at the idea of having a child who is not biologically related to them, and even more people change their mind when it comes to donating embryos, said Dr. Brad Van Voorhis, president of the reproductive technology society. \\"If you look at the literature on this, a lot of couples say at the outset that they're interested (in donating), but when push comes to shove, it's a much less frequent occurrence,\\" Van Voorhis said. Nidhi Desai, partner at Ballard, Desai & Miller in Chicago, which specializes in adoption and reproductive technology law, agreed, saying that while the number of embryo donors is on the rise, it's still a small number. It is becoming more and more common, but there's a very small minority of people who want to donate their embryos. — Nidhi Desai, Chicago attorney who specializes in adoption and reproductive technology law \\"The national landscape is there are more organizations that are beginning to look at this as a viable means of building a family,\\" Desai said. \\"Depends on the angle from which you approach it. It is becoming more and more common, but there's a very small minority of people who want to donate their embryos.\\" About 65,175 babies were born via IVF from clinics associated with the reproductive technology society in 2014, an increase from the 63,286 babies born via IVF from its clinics in 2013, according to a national report by the society. IVF accounts for less than 5 percent of all infertility treatment in the United States. Embryo donation is also getting a boost from religiously affiliated organizations like Nightlight, which see the unused embryos as an opportunity to promote anti-abortion issues. This also extends to the kind of terminology various groups use. \\"It's truly a gift to the adopting family,\\" said Kimberly Tyson, marketing and program director for Snowflakes. \\"The contract has adoption language, so the donor is relinquishing parental rights and responsibilities in that contract.\\" Anti-abortion groups believe that life begins at the point the egg and the sperm fuse, therefore they use terms like \\"adopter\\" rather than \\"recipient.\\" Van Voorhis, medical professionals and pro-abortion rights groups see embryos as a \\"scarce medical resource\\" rather than a child. In the eyes of the law, embryos are considered property, not people. Before an exchange occurs, both the donor and the recipient have to sign a contract exchanging property, Desai said. The Felices received a standard contract from Snowflakes and then made amendments with a lawyer. Neither the recipient nor the donor receive payment in the exchange. Donors are required to meet certain requirements set by the Food and Drug Administration, which could include testing for diseases like AIDS and hepatitis, and reviews of medical and genetic history. Although not required by the FDA, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommends recipients be tested for blood type and receive psychological counseling. At Snowflakes, recipients also have to complete a home study. The process can seem overwhelming, and there can be a significant financial commitment. But for couples like the Felices, the hardships are worth the outcome. ||||| \\"I made it less than a month,\\" Fleiderman says. Her doctor at the time had predicted that might happen. \\"He said right then and there, 'Your pregnancy's not going to last,' because of my age,\\" Fleiderman recalls. The following year, in 2008, Fleiderman and Borges turned to artificial insemination. Again Fleiderman got pregnant, but at around week five her OB-GYN told her she feared Fleiderman had an ectopic pregnancy. A few days later, Fleiderman was given medication to stop the growth of the abnormally progressing pregnancy, and she miscarried again. \\"The emotional and financial strain of trying to get pregnant and having failed pregnancies, one after another, it's horrible,\\" Fleiderman says. But she and Borges kept trying. Fleiderman's OB-GYN referred the couple to Dr. Sam Najmabadi, a reproductive endocrinology infertility specialist at the Center for Reproductive Health & Gynecology in Beverly Hills. Dr. Najmabadi oversaw two more rounds of artificial insemination, in November and December 2010, neither of which resulted in pregnancy. Fleiderman attempted one more round of artificial insemination with Dr. Najmabadi in March 2011. That didn't work, either. \\"He told me that was an indication that even if I went for full-on in-vitro [fertilization], my eggs were just not responding that well,\\" she says. Then, in late spring of 2011, Dr. Najmabadi brought up another way Fleiderman and Borges might conceive — with the help of an Arizona couple they'd never met. Fleiderman wasn't always sure she wanted to have a child, but she did have some parenting experience. From the time she was 36, she played second-in-command to the parents of her godson, Benjamin, who is now 16. Benjamin's father has been a close friend of Fleiderman's since her late 20s. She helped raise Benjamin since birth. \\"He's an only child and I was one of the first to hold him when he was born, and I just fell in love with him,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"I promised him I would stay by his side.\\" Fleiderman moved back to Los Angeles eight years ago from San Jose so she could keep that promise. She rented a room from Benjamin's father so she could live with her godson. \\"I was the one who taught him how to swim,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"I cared for him all the time when I lived with him, and after that he stayed with me on weekends. I was his third parent.\\" Sitting in Dr. Najmabadi's office that day in spring 2011, Fleiderman's complicated journey to motherhood finally came into focus. She recalls thinking: \\"I already had experience loving a child that wasn't genetically related to me.\\" She says that as she sat there crying, \\"I felt a divine assistance of some sort. I'm not a heavily religious person, but all of a sudden I felt compelled to ask, 'Is there anything else? Like embryo ... or something?'\\" Fleiderman recalls saying to Dr. Najmabadi, not really sure how to finish her own sentence. \\"And then he looked up at me, and he said, 'You know, as a matter of fact there is. Every now and again people leave embryos behind with me.'\\" In July 1978, the very first \\"test-tube baby,\\" Louise Joy Brown, was born in England. She arrived 34 years after the first human embryo was created in vitro — and after hundreds of failed attempts to birth an IVF baby. Infertility treatment and options would rapidly expand in the four decades following Brown's landmark birth. More than 5 million babies have now entered the world as a result of IVF. Embryo adoption is sort of a by-product of IVF. In IVF, eggs and sperm are collected (either the couple's own, or eggs and/or sperm provided by donors), and the healthiest eggs are fertilized by the sperm outside of the body, with the hope of creating multiple embryos. One round of IVF can cost up to 15,000 without egg or sperm donors — and up to 30,000 if an egg donor is needed. The embryos are given three to five days to mature, then one or more are transferred into a women's uterus, hopefully to implant and grow into a pregnancy. Others are frozen for later use. A 2011 summary of 295 assisted reproductive technology clinics and four cryo­storage facilities found that they were holding more than 387,000 frozen embryos — and estimated that another 225,000 frozen embryos were stored elsewhere in the United States. Along the way, a woman occasionally will end up with extra frozen embryos that she and her partner don't intend to use, for whatever reason. Often they don't know what to do with these extra embryos. Sometimes they store them, sometimes they unfreeze them and let nature take its course, and sometimes they give them to a doctor or a facility or a specific parent-to-be. \\"I almost never saw anybody donating embryos for adoption 20 years ago,\\" Dr. Najmabadi says. \\"I don't know if it's the times or our education of the patient, but now more and more of that is happening.\\" In 1997, Nightlight Christian Adoptions created the first embryo adoption agency, the Snowflakes Embryo Adoption and Donation program, in response to the growing number of unused IVF embryos in frozen storage facilities. Children born from the embryos donated through the agency are often called \\"snowflake babies.\\" Kimberly Tyson, Snowflakes' marketing and program director, says the name of the program was intentional — that \\"like natural snowflakes, human embryos are frozen, unique and a gift from heaven.\\" The term \\"snowflake babies\\" caught on, and many families now use the term for any baby born as a result of an embryo donation. Tyson says that well over 1,000 babies have been born into families through embryo adoption agencies, which operate similarly to some traditional adoption agencies in that the donating family chooses recipients from prospective parent profiles. \\"The essence of our embryo adoption model is to encourage open relationships between the donor and the adopter,\\" Tyson says. At Snowflakes, she adds, finding a donating family that's willing to adopt to a woman older than 45 is rare. She says donors \\"are trying to select the family that they believe will provide any resulting children with a safe and loving home environment, with parents who are healthy and able to care for them.\\" \\"There really isn't a difference in a woman's ability to actually carry a pregnancy with an adopted embryo, whether she's 48 or 46 or 45.\\" —Dr. Kristin A. Bendikson, with the USC Keck School of Medicine Facebook Twitter More shares recommend reddit email Embryo donation also occurs at the fertility clinics where the embryos were created. At the clinics, the biological parents generally don't participate in selecting prospective parents for their donated embryos and are more likely to remain anonymous. Dr. Najmabadi says that at his clinic, some donors do place restrictions on potential recipients but for the most part don't remain involved after they choose to donate their embryos. Dr. Kristin A. Bendikson, with the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the USC Keck School of Medicine, says her clinic transfers adopted embryos into women up to the age of 53. \\"There really isn't a difference in a woman's ability to actually carry a pregnancy with an adopted embryo, whether she's 48 or 46 or 45.\\" According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, women should not undergo embryo transfers after the age of 55. Dr. Bendikson acknowledges that an older couple considering embryo adoption should take into account the potential drawbacks of having children at an advanced age. \\"I think that it's important to consider the long-term ability to fulfill the emotional, psychological and physical needs of the child, and also consider what the chances of long-term parental relationships are going to be,\\" she says. \\"I also think that it is helpful for anyone undergoing embryo adoption to undergo psychological counseling. That is beneficial not only because of the age of the patient but also because of the adoption process in general and having a child that is not genetically yours.\\"0x000A Couples who donate embryos also have pros and cons to take into account. Kimmi Carlos, a middle-school language arts teacher, and her husband, Ryan, a Los Angeles firefighter, had to weigh the emotional impact of donating embryos to a woman who would give birth to and raise a child that is genetically theirs. \\"When you're going through IVF, one thing that you're not really prepared for is the amount of extra embryos that you might have,\\" says Kimmi Carlos, who, like her husband, is 34. \\"The majority of people don't have a ton. They have what they need. It's more common to have too few than it is to have an abundance. \\" But Kimmi and Ryan Carlos did have an abundance of embryos. They were left with 12 strong embryos after successfully getting pregnant with their now 5-year-old twins, a boy and a girl. Kimmi Carlos had a tough time with her initial pregnancy with the twins. She spent nearly 12 weeks on bed rest, and she knew she didn't want go through that again. Then, 14 months after the twins were born, Kimmi Carlos got pregnant naturally with their third child, a son who's now 3. The Carlos family eventually decided to donate their remaining 12 embryos. \\"I personally struggled, as I'd be pushing my twins on swings at the park, with why they got to be the lucky two, as much as I love them,\\" Kimmi Carlos says. \\"I felt in my heart the rest of them deserved the same chance at life.\\" The matured embryos that would become the Fleiderman-Borges twins came from a group of six that were created and frozen seven years before Fleiderman asked the right question at the right time in Dr. Naj­mabadi's office. Back in 2007, an Arizona couple had been having trouble getting pregnant, so they paid a donor to provide them with an egg to be fertilized by the husband's sperm. The couple traveled to L.A. and went through the IVF process with Dr. Najmabadi, and they successfully had a baby. Five years later, the couple decided that their family was complete and gave Dr. Najmabadi their blessing to donate their remaining half-dozen embryos to other hopeful parents-to-be. Fleiderman remembers Dr. Najmabadi pulling a sheet of paper out from under his desk calendar. The list contained the names of previous patients who had donated their extra frozen embryos. \\"The doctor told us it was impossible for us to have kids with her eggs, even though she was very healthy and could carry the pregnancy, so there wasn't much else we could do.\\" —Mauricio Borges Facebook Twitter More shares recommend reddit email And it was a short list. Of the roughly 40 percent of Dr. Najmabadi's patients who end up with extra embryos, he estimates that only 5 percent choose to donate their embryos to others. Dr. Najmabadi told Fleiderman that he could give her some embryos; she would have to pay only for the implantation. The cost would come to about 3,000. Fleiderman says that once she took her ego out of it, she loved the idea. \\"I thought, 'If I'm a true mother, I want [my] children to have the strongest bodies possible,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"So I should not try and insist they be from my eggs.\\" The egg donor the Arizona couple used was 22 years old at the time the embryos were created. Borges says he was willing to try everything to have children together, no matter what. \\"The doctor told us it was impossible for us to have kids with her eggs, even though she was very healthy and could carry the pregnancy, so there wasn't much else we could do,\\" Borges says. \\"She asked me what I thought, and I said, 'If it's good for you, it's good for me.'\\" There also was the cost factor. Securing an egg donor and going through the IVF process would come to about 30,000 — 10 times as much as embryo adoption. \\"It was beyond a generous offer,\\" Fleiderman says. Once Fleiderman decided to go forward with the gift, she let Dr. Najmabadi choose the donor from the list. \\"I didn't want to pick, because it didn't sit right,\\" she says. \\"It felt like shopping. Letting the doctor choose made it feel more natural.\\" Dr. Najmabadi says that when it's left up to him, he tries to select embryos that come from biological parents who have similar physical characteristics to those of the parents-to-be. \\"We try to match the prospective parent with a close match in race, eye color and hair color of the donor,\\" Najmabadi says. \\"For example, if someone comes in with blond hair and green eyes, we would go through our data bank and say, OK, we have maybe one donor that matches them or three donors that match them, and then we present those options to the patient.\\" He says he can describe the donors' characteristics to the would-be parents but can't show any pictures due to doctor-patient confidentiality. Kai and Audrey's genetic parents were the closest physical match to Fleiderman and her husband, and made the most sense to Dr. Najmabadi in terms of the other factors, so their embryos were the ones chosen to come to life. The embryo transplant wasn't an immediate success. In June 2011, Dr. Najmabadi initially tried to transfer only one embryo, because Fleiderman didn't want to chance a multiple birth. The process itself takes less than 10 minutes. To prepare, the patient goes through a series of estrogen and progesterone supplements, to mimic what would be happening to the body if it were experiencing a natural pregnancy. The embryos are thawed on either day three or day five of the progesterone supplement, corresponding to whether the embryos were frozen on day three or day five after fertilization. On the day of transfer, the patient takes a Valium and goes into a dark room near the back of the clinic to relax. Some patients opt to receive acupuncture. Then Dr. Naj­mabadi goes to work. \\"I go in under ultrasound guidance, put a catheter into the uterus and release the embryos into the uterus,\\" Dr. Najmabadi says. \\"That's it. That's the embryo transfer process.\\" The next step is implantation, in which the embryo basically digs itself into the uterine lining. It doesn't always work. \\"Once it's figured out, someone will win the Nobel Prize, because there's a lot that we don't know about it,\\" Dr. Najmabadi says of the factors that guide implantation. The embryo successfully implanted into Fleiderman's uterine lining — but the pregnancy resulted in another miscarriage, on Fleiderman's 48th birthday. \\"That one was probably the hardest,\\" she says. Dr. Najmabadi says he suspected the problem might have been with the embryo itself. \\"Many times abnormal embryos do not continue past a certain stage of pregnancy after they have implanted,\\" he says. \\"It is sometimes possible to get pregnant with an abnormal embryo that then results in a miscarriage.\\" Genetic screening and diagnosis of the embryo can be done, reducing the odds of an abnormal embryo being transferred. However, Dr. Najmabadi says this kind of testing is invasive and expensive, so most embryo transfers are done without it. Fleiderman tried again four months later, this time with two embryos. But neither would implant into her uterine wall. Fleiderman feared the stress of the loss of her mother, who had died from lymphoma, was not helping the situation. So she decided to take a break. \\"Then my husband got himself detained,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"I made the mistake of getting arrested while driving without a license, and that put me in a very bad situation,\\" Borges says. \\"They were going to deport me back to Brazil.\\" Borges was first sent to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Contra Costa West County Detention Facility in Richmond before being relocated to the Adelanto Detention Facility in Adelanto. Merely being married to a U.S. citizen is no longer a path to getting a green card if a person didn't enter the country legally in the first place. Because Borges entered the United States illegally in 2002, his marriage to Fleiderman, a U.S. citizen, is irrelevant to his immigration status. With her husband stuck in Adelanto, Fleiderman decided to push ahead and try to get pregnant again. This time, Dr. Najmabadi suggested trying to implant all three of the remaining embryos. But Fleiderman told him she wasn't sure she could handle it if all three happened to take, so she wanted to try with two instead. Fleiderman says that on that day in February 2013, she showed up for the procedure at her most relaxed yet. \\"I went in by myself, popped the Valium and fell asleep after the transfer,\\" she says. \\"It felt a lot like a Pap smear and only took about an eighth of a second. And bam! I was pregnant.\\" It took weeks before Fleiderman's blood test showed that both embryos had successfully implanted. Fleiderman admits that when Dr. Najmabadi confirmed she was pregnant with twins, she was torn. \\"At that point I was so tired they could have told me I was going to give birth to Martians and I would have been like, 'OK, that's fine. What time do I need to report for the birth?'\\" But at other times, she says, \\"I definitely freaked out that there were two.\\" She was still unsure of her husband's residency status. Borges' immigration lawyers were telling Fleiderman there was a 50-50 chance that he'd be deported to Brazil. \\"I was anticipating that I would basically be a single mother,\\" she says. \\"A single mother of one was daunting enough.\\" Fleiderman says she started thinking about articles she'd read that described complications with multiple births, as well as situations when embryos were removed to save other embryos, or because the number of births posed a risk to the mother's health, or even because the parent wasn't able to properly care for more than one infant. So she asked about embryo reduction. Embryo reduction is performed by only a few doctors in the Los Angeles area, and Dr. Najmabadi isn't one of them. It's a process where the doctor removes one or more embryos after an IVF cycle to give the other embryos a better chance of survival. Then Fleiderman's doctor showed her an ultrasound image of the two embryos and let her listen to their heartbeats. Fleiderman says she thought to herself, \\"Well, I'm kind of old to be having these babies, so I'll keep them both — so when I'm senile, they'll have each other.\\" But she still wasn't sure she could handle raising the two of them if her husband were to fail to get U.S. citizenship. She asked her cousin if he would be willing to raise one of them as a co-parent. She also scheduled an appointment to meet with an adoption counselor. After missing her appointment three times, Fleiderman says she was hit with another realization. \\"One day I just looked down at my belly and I said, 'OK, I get the message. You guys don't want to be separated.'\\" About halfway through Fleiderman's pregnancy, Borges was released from detention pending a deportation hearing. His immigration lawyers seemed to think the result would be one of two extremes: He would be granted a green card or sent back to Brazil. \\"I really worried about her, because she was so big and pregnant,\\" Borges says. \\"It wasn't easy for her, being 50 and pregnant with twins. And she helped me with lawyers, all the papers, everything to get me out of there.\\" Borges says when they let him leave Ade­lanto in May 2013, pending his hearing, that it was like \\"a gift from God.\\" And it left Fleiderman free to focus on enjoying her pregnancy as much as possible. \\"Pregnancy was not comfortable with twins, at 50, at all,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"My feet expanded a size and a half!\\" When the day finally came for the twins to be born — Sept. 24, 2013 — she was ready. \\"I actually drove myself to the maternity ward.\\" The twins were delivered via Cesarean section. Fleiderman made it through the delivery fine, but she lost a lot of blood due to a blood-clotting condition. \\"I remember hearing Kai. I heard him cry, and then I kind of deliriously remember Audrey,\\" she says. \\"And then I passed out.\\" \\"I saw my boy first, and after that Audrey,\\" Borges recalls. \\"Audrey was more skinny, smaller; Kai was bigger, more fat.\\" Audrey had to be kept in an incubator for a week because she did not have enough body fat to hold her temperature. \\"I was a little concerned,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"But I was happy they made it, that they were safe. It was a healthy pregnancy, by general standards.\\" Ariane Fleiderman with her son, Kai, and daughter, Audrey Photo by Danny Liao On Sept. 22, 2014, two days before the twins' first birthday, Borges had his deportation hearing. He was granted a temporary work visa and was permitted to stay in the United States legally. \\"It was my second chance,\\" Borges says. His second chance has allowed him to see Audrey and Kai start developing their own personalities. \\"Audrey is so smart, it's scary,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"She wants to do everything herself. She's my little chili pepper — she's a little spicy. \\"Kai is my little piece of chocolate,\\" she says. \\"He's just sweet.\\" Fleiderman and Borges say that Audrey looks out for Kai, even though she's younger by one minute. \\"They are like a team. Anytime you give anything to Audrey, like a piece of food, the first word out of her mouth is 'Kai,' to make sure you give something to Kai, too,\\" Borges says. \\"She is very protective of him. \\"They've hijacked my life,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"Which is fine. One nice thing about having them when I was older is that I've been able to travel and work [before I had them], and so I'm at peace with dedicating all my time to raising them.\\" From the group of embryos created by the Arizona couple, the twins have at least one sibling that Fleiderman knows about. \\"Kai and Audrey were frozen in time,\\" Fleiderman says. \\"They were conceived at the same time, but if they were ever to meet their sibling, their sibling would be eight years older.\\" Fleiderman and Borges say they're open to the twins meeting their biological family someday, if the Arizona couple is amenable. Dr. Najmabadi says he would be willing to discuss the issue with his patients. Fleiderman says she does not feel threatened by the possibility of bringing biological family members into her family dynamic — and she hopes other women having difficulty conceiving might come to the same realization. \\"I would tell women not to sweat making it their egg, and men not to sweat making it their sperm,\\" she says. Fleiderman says that even though it's not her and her husband's DNA they're passing on, they have been able to connect with their children in a profound way by experiencing pregnancy and childbirth. \\"I always tease people and say, 'I beat the fertility clock,'\\" she says. \\"How about that?\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Jamie and Dan Felice, a couple who struggled with infertility, found hope through embryo donation, a growing industry in the United States.

Question: What does Howard inquire about at the church? Movie plot title: Rawhead Rex Movie plot: Howard Hallenbeck (David Dukes) travels to Ireland to research items of religious significance. He goes to a rural church to photograph some graves. Meanwhile, three farmers are attempting to remove an ominous stone column from a field. Two of the farmers head home. A thunderstorm appears out of nowhere, and smoke pours from the ground. Lightning strikes the column. The monster Rawhead Rex rises from the dirt. Howard meets Declan O'Brien (Ronan Wilmot), who directs him to Reverend Coot. The curious O'Brien approaches the altar and places his hand on it. Images flash before his eyes. This experience apparently destroys O'Brien's sanity. Afterwards, Howard inquires about the church's parish records. Coot says he can arrange to have Howard look at them. Later, a man arrives at the home of locals Dennis and Jenny. He discovers a clearly traumatized Jenny. Police arrive. Rawhead drags Dennis's dead body through the forest and comes upon a trailer park. A teenager named Andy Johnson is trying to make out with his girlfriend. The two teens head into the woods. Soon after, Howard sees Rawhead on top of a distant hill with Andy's head in his hand. Afterwards, Howard speaks again with Coot, who tells him the church's parish records have been stolen.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the building which exact location early on is unknown? A third ward was created during Edward I's extension to the Tower, as the narrow enclosure completely surrounded the castle. At the same time a bastion known as Legge's Mount was built at the castle's north-west corner. Brass Mount, the bastion in the north-east corner, was a later addition. The three rectangular towers along the east wall 15 metres (49 ft) apart were dismantled in 1843. Although the bastions have often been ascribed to the Tudor period, there is no evidence to support this; archaeological investigations suggest that Legge's Mount dates from the reign of Edward I. Blocked battlements (also known as crenellations) in the south side of Legge's Mount are the only surviving medieval battlements at the Tower of London (the rest are Victorian replacements). A new 50-metre (160 ft) moat was dug beyond the castle's new limits; it was originally 4.5 metres (15 ft) deeper in the middle than it is today. With the addition of a new curtain wall, the old main entrance to the Tower of London was obscured and made redundant; a new entrance was created in the south-west corner of the external wall circuit. The complex consisted of an inner and an outer gatehouse and a barbican, which became known as the Lion Tower as it was associated with the animals as part of the Royal Menagerie since at least the 1330s. The Lion Tower itself no longer survives. Edward extended the south side of the Tower of London onto land that had previously been submerged by the River Thames. In this wall, he built St Thomas's Tower between 1275 and 1279; later known as Traitors' Gate, it replaced the Bloody Tower as the castle's water-gate. The building is unique in England, and the closest parallel is the now demolished water-gate at the Louvre in Paris. The dock was covered with arrowslits in case of an attack on the castle from the River; there was also a portcullis at the entrance to control who entered. There were luxurious lodgings on the first floor. Edward also moved the Royal Mint into the Tower; its exact location early on...

Next, the topic of divination (called the \`\`charge'') was posed, such as whether a particular ancestor was causing a king's toothache. The divination charges were often directed at ancestors, whom the ancient Chinese revered and worshiped, as well as natural powers and Dì (帝), the highest god in the Shang society. A wide variety of topics were asked, essentially anything of concern to the royal house of Shang, from illness, birth and death, to weather, warfare, agriculture, tribute and so on. One of the most common topics was whether performing rituals in a certain manner would be satisfactory.","completion":"Yes, it's true that oracle bones were used by the Chinese to divine the past, as well as to seek guidance and answers to questions about various aspects of life, as seen from the provided text. Oracle bones were employed mainly during the Shang Dynasty (approximately 1600 BCE – 1046 BCE) in China and were a significant aspect of their culture and beliefs. Oracle bones are typically split into turtle shells or animal bones, with the most common being ox scapulae and turtle plastrons. These bones served as crucial tools for diviners who aimed to decipher messages and prophecies about past events and the possible consequences of their actions. The process of divination involved inscribing questions, also known as \\"charges,\\" and their responses on the oracle bones. The text explains the process of an oracle bone divination session. The divination started with an anointment of blood, which was followed by the inscription of the date using the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. This ancient Chinese calendar system combined ten celestial stems and twelve terrestrial branches to establish a cycle of 60 years, and oracle bones provided important evidence for understanding and reconstructing these chronological frameworks. The diviner's name would also be noted on the bones, followed by the charge, which covered a wide range of subjects relevant to the Shang royal house. These subjects included illness, birth, death, weather, warfare, agriculture, tributes, and rituals, among others. Ancestors, deities, and natural powers were frequently addressed in the charges, as the ancient Chinese believed they were influential forces in their lives. Since many questions were directed at ancestors whom the ancient Chinese revered and worshiped, oracle bones are considered an essential source for understanding the belief system, ancestral cults, and the hierarchy of deities in ancient Chinese society. Overtime, oracle bone divination fell out of practice, and the script used on these bones developed into modern-day Chinese characters. It wasn't until the end of the 19th century that oracle bones were rediscovered, and since then, they have proven to be an invaluable resource for historians, allowing them to gain extensive insights into the political, economic, cultural, and religious aspects of ancient China, particularly during the Shang Dynasty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First, lay out all the eggs you’re boiling in a pot. Then pour in cold water until the eggs are just covered. Since quail eggs are so small, using a pan instead of a pot will make the water boil faster. Just make sure the water covers the eggs entirely. Dip a slotted spoon into the water and fish out each egg. Place it in a bowl of water filled with ice to cool it off enough to handle. Leave the eggs in the bath for 1 minute and then check if they’re cool enough. Wait longer if they’re still hot. Don’t reach into the boiling water or you will burn yourself. The ice bath also makes the shells come off easier when you peel the eggs. Once you’ve peeled the eggs, there are many ways to serve them. Pop them in your mouth whole for a quick snack. For a classic breakfast, put the eggs on a piece of toast with salt and pepper. Sliced up quail eggs also work as a great salad topping. Use a very thin knife to slice the eggs. If you don’t have a thin knife, try using a strip of dental floss to slice them. If you like spice, add some powdered cayenne pepper. Boiled eggs can last up to a week in the refrigerator.

The sentence consists of a combination of words that can be deciphered to better understand this positive evaluation. First, let's dissect the phrase \\"awfully good\\". Although \\"awfully\\" might be considered negative when used independently, when used in this context as an adverb, it serves to intensify the adjective \\"good.\\" This expression ultimately means that the movie was extremely good or exceptionally good, which supports the idea that the reviewer has a positive opinion about the movie. Now, let's examine the \\"achingly human picture\\" part of this sentence. An \\"achingly human picture\\" indicates that the movie contained elements that were very relatable, emotionally touching, and perhaps raw in representing the human experience. By using the word \\"achingly\\", the reviewer highlights the intensity of the movie's realism and the emotions it evokes, which are more likely to be interpreted as positive qualities. The word \\"human\\" also implies the movie captured the essence of human emotions, experiences, and behaviors, making it captivating and engaging to the audience. Given these observations, we can conclude that the movie was seen positively by the reviewer.

He was subsequently convicted of four counts (one count of obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury, and one count of making false statements), making him the highest-ranking White House official convicted in a government scandal since John Poindexter, the national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan in the Iran-Contra affair. On March 6, 2007, the jury convicted him on four of the five counts but acquitted him on count three, the second charge of making false statements when interviewed by federal agents about his conversations with Time reporter Matthew Cooper. After being questioned by the FBI in the fall of 2003 and testifying before a Federal grand jury on March 5, 2004, and again on March 24, 2004, Libby pleaded not guilty to all five counts. According to the Associated Press, David Addington, Cheney's legal counsel, described a September 2003 meeting with Libby around the time that a criminal investigation began, saying that Libby had told him, \\"'I just want to tell you, I didn't do it'... I didn't ask what the 'it' was.'\\" Libby retained attorney Ted Wells of the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to represent him. Wells had successfully defended former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy against a 30-count indictment and had also participated in the successful defense of former Secretary of Labor Raymond Donovan. After Judge Reggie Walton denied Libby's motion to dismiss, the press initially reported that Libby would testify at the trial. Libby's criminal trial, United States v. Libby, began on January 16, 2007. A parade of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists testified, including Bob Woodward, Walter Pincus and Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post and Judith Miller and David E. Sanger of The New York Times. Despite earlier press reports and widespread speculation, neither Libby nor Vice President Cheney testified. The jury began deliberations on February 21, 2007.

Help as much as you can. Given a scientific question and its correct answer, generate supporting facts for the answer. This supporting fact can be an explanation for the answer to the given question. Question: What do you call plastids that contain the green pigment chlorophyll? Answer: chloroplasts","completion":"Supporting Fact 1: Chloroplasts are the organelles responsible for photosynthesis, which is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose or other sugars. Supporting Fact 2: The green pigment chlorophyll in chloroplasts allows these organisms to absorb sunlight, particularly in the blue and red parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This absorption of light energy enables the excitation of electrons which then initiates the process of photosynthesis. Supporting Fact 3: Chloroplasts are unique to plants and photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms, and they have a double membrane structure. They contain their own DNA, which indicates they likely evolved from ancient photosynthetic bacteria through a process called endosymbiosis. Supporting Fact 4: There are two main types of chlorophyll found in chloroplasts: chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. Both types have a similar structure but slightly different absorption properties, which allows plants to maximize energy capture from sunlight. Supporting Fact 5: The structure of a chloroplast comprises an outer membrane, an inner membrane, internal stacks of flattened sac-like structures called thylakoids, which house the chlorophyll molecules, and a surrounding fluid called stroma. The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis occur in the thylakoid membranes, while the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) occur in the stroma."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: a close up of a fast flowing mountain stream in winter","completion":"The most important words in the sentence \\"a close up of a fast flowing mountain stream in winter\\" are \\"close up,\\" \\"fast flowing,\\" \\"mountain stream,\\" and \\"winter.\\" These words bear the most significance as they convey the key elements and features of the scene being described. 1. Close up: This phrase indicates that the focus is on a particular aspect or detail of the mountain stream. It suggests that instead of viewing the stream from a distance, we are brought nearer to it, allowing us to observe its characteristics more closely. 2. Fast flowing: This term describes the movement of the water in the stream. The stream is not stagnant or calm; instead, it rushes with energy and speed, creating an atmosphere of dynamism and vibrancy. This detail also impacts other aspects of the scene, such as the sound and sights of the flowing water, potentially evoking feelings of excitement or awe in the observer. 3. Mountain stream: These words set the location and context of the scene. A mountain stream is a natural watercourse that typically arises in an upland or hilly region and flows downhill. It has characteristics distinct from other bodies of water, such as lakes or rivers, which can be broader and calmer. Mountain streams can be associated with purity, freshness, and the untamed beauty of nature. 4. Winter: The season in which this scene takes place greatly affects the overall mood and imagery. Winter brings with it cold temperatures, snow, and ice, dramatically changing the landscape and the appearance of the stream. The combination of a fast flowing mountain stream in the winter suggests challenges related to the harsh environment, such as frozen water and slippery surfaces, but can also evoke a sense of tranquility and desolation. Each of these words holds a specific significance within the sentence and, when taken together, they paint a vivid and engaging picture of a close up of a fast flowing mountain stream in winter."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Build a movie plot around this: Who caught JKB coming out of Sindhu's apartment? Bhairavi Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Establish the main characters and their backgrounds In order to build a movie plot around the given information, the first step is to establish the main characters and their backgrounds. In this case, the main characters are JKB, Sindhu, and Bhairavi. - JKB: A successful businessman who is married to Bhairavi but is secretly having an affair with Sindhu. - Sindhu: A young and attractive woman who lives alone in her apartment. She is involved in a secret affair with JKB. - Bhairavi: JKB's wife, who is unaware of her husband's infidelity until she catches him coming out of Sindhu's apartment. Step 2: Develop the plot and conflicts Now, we'll build up the story by developing the plot and creating conflicts between the characters. 1. The movie starts by introducing the seemingly perfect life of JKB and Bhairavi, portraying them as a happy and successful couple. 2. As the story unfolds, JKB's secret affair with Sindhu is revealed. They are shown to share a passionate and intense relationship, with JKB frequently visiting Sindhu's apartment. 3. Meanwhile, Bhairavi starts getting suspicious about her husband's behavior and their deteriorating relationship. She decides to investigate the matter and follow JKB one day. 4. On the day of the climax, Bhairavi follows her husband, expecting to uncover a secret. She then catches JKB leaving Sindhu's apartment. This moment serves as the turning point in the story, shattering Bhairavi's trust in JKB. 5. Enraged and heartbroken, Bhairavi confronts JKB about his infidelity, leading to a major conflict between them. This confrontation also alerts Sindhu of Bhairavi's knowledge of the affair. 6. As the plot thickens, Sindhu, fearing the repercussions of their affair getting exposed, decides to leave the city. JKB, on the other hand, is left to face the consequences of his actions and attempts to mend the broken relationship with Bhairavi. 7. In the end, JKB acknowledges his mistakes, and although the trust between him and Bhairavi is severely damaged, they decide to work on rebuilding their relationship. The movie ends on a note of hope with the possibility of redemption for the characters. Step 3: Justification of the steps Developing the plot around the given information primarily focuses on the relationship dynamics between the three main characters. Incorporating elements of drama, betrayal, and conflict serve to create an engaging movie plot that will keep the audience hooked. By following the character development and story progression, the plot provides a comprehensive and believable narrative that addresses the given situation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was alienated from Johnson due to doubts concerning the 1965 bombing of North Vietnam? Hubert Humphrey was a Minnesotan who became a nationally prominent politician. He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes. As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party. Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue. Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine. This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years. The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days. Finally, in June 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law. Humphrey called this his greatest achievement. Lyndon B. Johnson recruited Humphrey for his running mate in the 1964...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Columbus Delano, (June 4, 1809 - October 23, 1896) was a lawyer, rancher, banker, statesman and a member of the prominent Delano family. Delano was elected U.S. Congressman from Ohio, serving two full terms and one partial one. Prior to the American Civil War, Delano was a National Republican and then a Whig; as a Whig he was identified with the faction of the party that opposed the spread of slavery into the Western territories, and he became a Republican when the party was founded as the major anti-slavery party after the demise of the Whigs in the 1850s. During Reconstruction Delano advocated federal protection of African-Americans civil rights, and argued that the former Confederate states should be administered by the federal government, but were not part of the United States until they met the requirements for readmission to the Union. Context: In 1875, Delano's reputation for personal honesty came under increasing scrutiny as revelations of corruption in the Grant administration continued to be the subject of investigations and media revelations. Westerners unhappy with Delano's rulings on land grants and other issues accused Delano's son John, an employee of the Interior Department, of corruption, bribery, and fraud. Governor Edward M. McCook of the Colorado Territory, claimed that John Delano had accepted a 1,200 bribe from a Colorado banker, Jerome B. Chaffee, to secure land patents from the Department of Interior. The New-York Tribune reported that John Delano was profiteering through Interior's Office of the Surveyor General by accepting partnerships in Wyoming surveying contracts without having been trained in surveying or map making, and without providing any meaningful contribution to the fulfillment of the contracts; the obvious implication was John Delano had taken extortion money from illicit contract agreements. In March 1875, the former chief clerk of the Surveyor's Office, L. C. Stevens, wrote to Benjamin Bristow, Grant's Secretary of the Treasury, stating that Surveyor General Silas Reed had made several corrupt contracts which financially benefited John Delano. Stevens also said both Reed and John Delano had blackmailed five deputy surveyors for 5,000. More damaging was Stevens' charge that Columbus Delano knew and approved of what Reed had done for John Delano. Both Bristow and Secretary of State Hamilton Fish demanded that Grant fire Delano. Grant declined, telling Fish, \\"If Delano were now to resign, it would be retreating under fire and be accepted as an admission of the charges.\\" The controversy did not abate; by mid-August it became clear that Delano could not remain in office; Delano offered his resignation and Grant accepted, but Grant did not make it public. Grant finally announced his acceptance of Delano's resignation on October 19, 1875, after Bristow threatened to resign if Delano was not replaced. Grant replaced Delano with Zachariah Chandler, who quickly initiated civil service and other reforms in the Department of the Interior. Delano's administration was investigated by Congress, Chandler, and a special presidential commission; his personal conduct was exonerated, but his reputation as an honest, capable administrator was damaged, and Delano never again ran for office or served in an appointed one. In April 1876, The Committee on the Expeditures in the Interior Department confirmed that Reed had set up an illicit slush fund for John Delano's financial benefit, and that Delano thanked Reed while also telling him \\"to be careful to do nothing that would have the semblance of wrong.\\" Question: what was the corruption?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The corruption allegations against Columbus Delano and his son, John Delano, revolved around several misconducts in connection with the Interior Department of the U.S. government in the mid 1870s. The primary charges against Columbus Delano's son John Delano were of corruption, bribery, fraud, and profiteering, all committed while he was an employee of the Interior Department, primarily operating under the Office of the Surveyor General. Governor Edward M. McCook accused John Delano of accepting a 1,200 bribe from a Colorado banker, Jerome B. Chaffee, in exchange for securing land patents through the Department of Interior, implicating Delano family's unlawful use of public office for private gains. John Delano was also accused of profiteering, as he accepted partnerships in Wyoming surveying contracts despite having no relevant expertise in surveying or mapmaking, and without making any significant contribution towards fulfilling those contracts. This suggested that he was making illicit contract agreements and effectively taking extortion money. Furthermore, the former chief clerk of the Surveyor's Office, L. C. Stevens, claimed that John Delano and Surveyor General Silas Reed had engaged in several corrupt contracts that ultimately benefited John Delano financially. Stevens further alleged that Reed and John Delano had blackmailed five deputy surveyors for 5,000. The most damaging charge, however, was probably Stevens' assertion that Columbus Delano not only knew about these corrupt actions but also approved of what Reed and his son John had done. Such allegations cast serious doubt on Delano's integrity as an administrator, effectively discrediting his claim of personal honesty and commitment to fair governance. These allegations led to investigations by Benjamin Bristow, the Grant administration's Secretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of State Hamilton Fish. The ensuing political turmoil led to the resignation of Columbus Delano, and his replacement by Zachariah Chandler, who initiated substantial civil service and other reforms in the Department of the Interior. While Columbus Delano was not personally found guilty of corruption, his administration was implicated and his reputation was tarnished due to his perceived complicity in the aforementioned practices of his son and Surveyor General Silas Reed. In April 1876, the Committee on the Expenditures in the Interior Department confirmed that Silas Reed had indeed set up an illicit slush fund for the financial benefit of John Delano, and that Columbus Delano, while cautioning Reed to avoid indiscretion, had effectively endorsed these malpractices. The corruption controversies and his resultant resignation marked the end of Delano's political career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Six years ago, Houston Police Department forensic artist Lois Gibson confirmed it was McDuffie.","completion":"Title: Farewell to Glenn McDuffie: The Iconic 'Kissing Sailor' Passes Away The world has bid farewell to Glenn McDuffie, the man who captured the hearts of millions through a single kiss. Passing away on March 9 in a Dallas nursing home, McDuffie became a symbol of joy and freedom at the end of World War II. It was during a time of celebration and relief when photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt captured McDuffie in an impromptu moment, locking lips with a nurse in Times Square, on V-J Day, August 14, 1945. Step 1: Introduce the main subject and importance of Glenn McDuffie. The immediately recognizable photograph titled \\"V-J Day in Times Square\\" featured a sailor in a dark uniform kissing a nurse in her white attire amidst a throng of people. The image instantly became an emblem of love and triumph over the challenges of war, showcasing a glimmer of hope in the face of adversity. Step 2: Discuss the controversy regarding the identity of the 'Kissing Sailor.' There were, however, several claims to the fame of the 'Kissing Sailor.' Various men came forward, each asserting their role in the iconic moment as Eisenstaedt hadn't initially captioned his photo. Due to the numerous testimonies, the true identity of the sailor became an intriguing mystery for decades. Step 3: Explain how forensic evidence provided the confirmation. It wasn't until six years ago that the enigma was finally put to rest. Houston Police Department forensic artist, Lois Gibson, confirmed Glenn McDuffie as the man in the photograph. Turning to forensic techniques, Gibson was able to unveil the truth behind the snapshot that would forever immortalize McDuffie in history. Step 4: Reflect on McDuffie's legacy. Glenn McDuffie's passing marks the end of an era, and his legacy will forever live on through the iconic photograph that captured the essence of celebration and relief following the end of World War II.

Questions: The boss gave him the money to appease the clients, he had to what? Options: - buy a train ticket - create art - apply for job - take care of proposals - stand in line Answer:","completion":"The boss gave him the money to appease the clients, and based on the provided options, the most logical and common-sense choice would be for him to \\"take care of proposals.\\" The reasoning behind choosing this option comes from a deeper understanding of the context and an evaluation of the implications of the other options. The primary goal, as stated in the question, is to appease the clients. In a professional setting, this often means addressing their concerns, meeting their needs, and making sure they are satisfied with the services or products provided. A thorough analysis of the given options helps to clarify why \\"take care of proposals\\" would be the best fit in this case: 1. \\"Buy a train ticket\\": There is no context suggesting that he needs to travel to address the clients' needs or concerns. While it might be possible that buying a train ticket could be part of a bigger strategy, it appears to be unrelated to appeasing the clients directly. 2. \\"Create art\\": Unless the person is working in a creative industry where art plays a significant role in client satisfaction, creating art is likely not the primary method to appease clients in a professional context. It might serve as a good gesture or show creativity, but it doesn't directly address their concerns or requirements. 3. \\"Apply for a job\\": Applying for a job is entirely unrelated to the task of appeasing clients. It doesn't provide any means of addressing their concerns or ensuring satisfaction with the services or products offered. 4. \\"Stand in line\\": This option is ambiguous and unrelated to the primary task of appeasing clients. It does not provide any context or indication as to how standing in line would accomplish the goal of addressing client concerns or needs. In summary, considering the context and goal of appeasing clients, the most appropriate action based on common sense amongst the provided options is for him to \\"take care of proposals.\\" This choice implies that the person would be drafting, revising, or presenting proposals to address client concerns or requirements, offering a solution that is likely to lead to improved client satisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The possible answers provided are: 1. Closet: Though shirts can be hung in closets, the action of \\"pulling open\\" does not match with the general motion of opening a closet door, which typically involves turning a doorknob and either pulling or pushing the door open. 2. Chest: While a chest can store various items, it usually has a lid or top that is lifted, rather than being pulled open. 3. Drawer: This is the most logical choice, as drawers are common storage spaces for clothing items such as shirts. Additionally, the action of \\"pulling open\\" accurately describes how one would open a drawer. 4. Dresser: A dresser contains drawers for storing clothes, but the question specifically refers to what John pulled open, which would be the drawer rather than the dresser itself. 5. Suitcase: While shirts can be stored in a suitcase (primarily during travel), the context of the sentence does not indicate that John is traveling or needs to access his clothing within a suitcase. Because the action of \\"pulling open\\" matches the way in which drawers are typically opened and the context of the question suggests that John is trying to retrieve an item of clothing, \\"drawer\\" is the most appropriate and accurate answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: In this courtroom sketch from Monday, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, center, sits stone-faced during court proceedings. While the Twin Towers still burned, on the afternoon of Sept. 11, 2001, Osama Bin Laden turned for help to someone he knew he could trust, a prosecutor said Wednesday just blocks from Ground Zero. The Al Qaeda boss turned to son-in-law Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, the prosecutor said. RELATED: JURY BEING SELECTED FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN’S SON-IN-LAW “He needed the world to know that his organization was responsible,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin thundered in an opening statement for Abu Ghaith's terrorism trial in Manhattan Federal Court. “Literally moments after the attacks of Sept. 11, Osama Bin Laden turned to this man,” Lewin said, pointing to Abu Ghaith, who sat stone-faced in a dark suit and blue silk tie. “Osama Bin Laden asked that man to deliver Al Qaeda’s murderous decree to the entire world. What did the defendant do? He agreed.” RELATED: TRIAL OF OSAMA'S SON-IN-LAW STARTS MONDAY Lewin showed a jury of nine women and three men a photo taken from an Al Qaeda propaganda video Abu Ghaith made with Bin Laden outside a cave in Afghanistan on Sept. 12, 2001. “This is Osama Bin Laden. This is this man,” the prosecutor said. “This is on Sept. 12, 2001. It was the most important moment in Al Qaeda’s savage history.” Abu Ghaith, 48, a Muslim cleric from Kuwait said to be the high-ranking Al Qaeda figure tried on U.S. soil since the 9/11 attacks, is charged with conspiring to kill Americans and with providing support to terrorists in his role as an Al Qaeda spokesman. The feds claim Abu Ghaith rallied Al Qaeda terrorists at training camps in Afghanistan and recruited new fighters to the organization with his speeches. RELATED: BIN LADEN'S SON-IN-LAW FAILS TO GET TERRORISM CHARGES DROPPED He faces up to life in prison if convicted. His trial is expected to last about three weeks. Defense lawyer Stanley Cohen heaped scorn on the prosecution’s case after listening to Lewin address the jury Wednesday. RELATED: ‘NOT A SHRED OF EVIDENCE’ TO SUPPORT OSAMA BIN LADEN SON-IN-LAW’S SURVEILLANCE FEARS: JUDGE “You’ve just been to the movies, ladies and gentlemen,” Cohen said. The lawyer conceded the horror of the 9/11 attacks and admitted his client spouted hate in the aftermath of the disaster. RELATED: OSAMA BIN LADEN'S SON-IN-LAW WANTS TO DUMP ATTORNEY FOR NEW LAWYER “These words are terrible. They’re dumb. … They’ll outrage you. They should,” Cohen said. “9/11 hangs heavy over this courtroom.” But the lawyer told the jury, “This is not about Osama Bin Laden and this is not a trial about the plot of 9/11” because Abu Ghaith isn’t accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks. RELATED: TERROR TRIAL DELAYED BY SEQUESTRATION The case will boil down to mere “words and association,” rather than hard evidence of wrongdoing, Cohen said, telling jurors that his client is a human being, not a monster. “He’s a Muslim. He’s an Arab ... He’s a husband. He’s a father,” the lawyer said. “There’s really no evidence (of guilt). There’s a substitution of evidence with fright.” RELATED: BIN LADEN’S SON-IN-LAW ABU GHAITH PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO 9/11 PLOTTING Making a comparison between Abu Ghaith and Thomas Preston, a British soldier acquitted in the Boston Massacre of 1770 after being defended at trial by future president John Adams, Cohen urged the jury to “prove our greatness” as a country. “That jury in that important case … returned a verdict of not guilty and everyone was stunned,” Cohen said. “You have the same tenacity … to do what that jury did do.” The trial will feature testimony from two onetime Al Qaeda operatives now cooperating with the feds, said Lewin, the prosecutor. The first, known to be Saajid Badat, is a British man who plotted with “shoe bomber” Richard Reid and who will testify next week via video feed from Britain. The second is a man from upstate New York who spent time in Afghanistan and will tell jurors that he heard Abu Ghaith preach holy war. The defendant was referring to upcoming Al Qaeda shoe bomb attacks like the one Reid attempted when he recorded a post-9/11 propaganda video with the message, “The storm of airplanes will not stop,” Lewin said. “You will watch the defendant committing his crimes,” the prosecutor told jurors, promising to show them the many videos Abu Ghaith made in 2001 and 2002. The two cooperating witnesses are not credible, Cohen countered.

The research by scientists at the University of California is published in the journal ACS Nano. Medical applications for micro-machines include the release of drugs into specific locations within the body. But until now, they have only been tested in laboratory cell samples. A team led by Professors Liangfang Zhang and Joseph Wang from UC, San Diego fed the tiny motors to mice. The machines, made of polymer tubes coated with zinc, are just 20 micrometres long - the width of a strand of human hair. In stomach acid, the zinc reacts to produce bubbles of hydrogen, which propel the machines into the lining of the stomach, where they attach. As the machines dissolve, they deliver their cargoes into the stomach tissue. The researchers say the method may offer an efficient way to deliver drugs into the stomach, to treat peptic ulcers and other illnesses. In their paper, they suggest that further work is needed to \\"further evaluate the performance and functionalities of various man-made micro-motors in living organisms. This study represents the very first step toward such a goal\\". The idea of surgery on a tiny scale can be traced back to a lecture by celebrated physicist Richard Feynman in 1959 called There is Plenty of Room at the Bottom. In the talk to the American Physical Society (APS), he explained: \\"Although it is a very wild idea, it would be interesting in surgery if you could swallow the surgeon. \\"You put the mechanical surgeon inside the blood vessel and it goes into the heart and 'looks' around.

Question: She had a busy schedule, she had to run errands and pick up the kids the second she did what? Options: A. make time for B. take money C. go outdoors D. leave work E. field A:","completion":"A detailed answer would be: Option D, \\"leave work,\\" is the most logical and in line with common sense to answer the question. The context of the question revolves around the individual having a busy schedule, which likely includes a mix of professional and personal responsibilities. The question implies that there is an immediate need to start attending to her responsibilities, specifically running errands and picking up the kids, as soon as she completes a particular task. Out of all the options presented, Option D, \\"leave work,\\" is the most aligned with the situation described. Work is a part of many people's daily routine and an individual's ability to attend to personal matters is often limited or postponed until after their professional obligations have been met. Once she leaves work, it is a natural transition for her to start addressing her personal tasks, such as running errands and picking up the kids. Option A, \\"make time for,\\" could seem reasonable, but it is not specific enough. Making time could be related to various activities or events and does not necessarily indicate an endpoint to her professional obligations. Option B, \\"take money,\\" is irrelevant to the context and lacks any connection to her daily schedule, errands, or picking up the kids. It also does not clearly indicate when she can start attending to her personal tasks. Option C, \\"go outdoors,\\" can be considered too vague and not directly related to her schedule, errands, or picking up the kids. Going outdoors could be part of her daily routine, but it does not necessarily mean she has finished her work or is ready to attend to personal matters. Lastly, Option E, \\"field,\\" is not a relevant or coherent choice for the question as it is just a noun and does not provide any clear indication of how it is related to her busy schedule or the completion of a specific task. In conclusion, Option D, \\"leave work,\\" is the most sensible and in line with common sense to answer the question. It provides a clear demarcation between her professional obligations and the point at which she can begin attending to her personal responsibilities, such as running errands and picking up the kids."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

State TV showed the 86-year-old voting at a polling station where he is said to have spent up to an hour talking to other voters and the media. The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Havana says he was stooped and spoke with a faint, weak voice. A crowd surrounded his car, cheering as he was driven off, she adds. All organised opposition is banned in Cuba and all candidates for elections have been selected by the ruling Communist Party or its affiliated associations. More than 600 delegates will take their seats in the National Assembly and approve the candidates for Cuba's key political positions. With President Raul Castro - Fidel's younger brother - already 81, Cubans are watching for any sign as to who might follow him, our correspondent says. The choice of vice-presidents and ministers could suggest who is being groomed to carry on the revolution, she adds. ||||| A man stands next to a Cuban flag in Havana February 3, 2013.

Election officials sit at a table near pictures of Latin American revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara (L) and Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez in Havana February 3, 2013. HAVANA Retired Cuban leader Fidel Castro voted in Cuba's general election on Sunday and chatted with well wishers and Cuban reporters in Havana for more than an hour, in his first extended public appearance since 2010. Castro had voted from his home in three previous elections since taking ill in 2006 and ceding power to his brother Raul two years later. A stooped, snow white bearded Castro, 86, was seen on state-run television as he cast his ballot in the late afternoon, wearing a blue plaid shirt and light blue jacket. The announcer said Castro talked about efforts to reform the economy, Latin American integration, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and other matters. He was heard in a weak voice praising popular participation in Sunday's election. \\"The people are truly revolutionary, they have really sacrificed. We don't have to prove it, history will. Fifty years of the blockade and they haven't given in,\\" he said. Cubans went to the polls to elect a Communist Party-selected slate of 612 deputies to the National Assembly and more than 1,000 delegates to provincial assemblies, at a time of change in how they live and work, but not in how they vote. President Raul Castro and other leaders were also shown on television casting their ballots and commenting on the importance of the election as a show of support for reforms and independence from the United States. Raul Castro is decentralizing the state-dominated economy, allowing more space for private initiative in agriculture and retail services and has lifted many restrictions on personal freedoms, such as travel and buying and selling homes and cars. He has also introduced term limits (two five-year stints) for top government posts, but has drawn the line at legalizing other political parties and contested elections. \\"Renouncing the principle of a single party would be equal to legalizing one or more imperialist parties,\\" Castro said at a Party conference last year. He insisted critics, and even some friends, did not take into account the \\"abnormal state of siege\\" the country is experiencing. \\"The one-party elections in Cuba, alongside steady but slow progress on opening the economy, represent how the current regime intends to manage change on the island - giving the people more space to participate in the economy while controlling their role in politics and civic life,\\" said Ted Piccone, deputy director of foreign policy at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. Some 95 percent of Cuba's 8.7 million residents over 16 years of age were expected to cast ballots with polling stations on just about every block and where abstention is frowned on. 'ALL REVOLUTIONARIES' Reuters talked with more than half a dozen voters before they entered the polls in Havana. None of them knew the candidates on the national slate from their districts. \\"What's certain is they are all revolutionaries and that's what matters,\\" said retiree Eduardo Sanchez. \\"I vote because I feel I have to, and it doesn't really matter because the deputies have no power anyway,\\" said one young woman, who declined to give her name. The curious read biographies of candidates posted at the polls, then cast paper ballots in cardboard voting boxes guarded by school students. Others simply entered the polls and checked a box for the entire slate. The candidates were equal to the number of positions up for a vote, the only choice being to not vote for a certain candidate or leave blank or spoil one's ballot. The deputies are elected for five-year terms. The new assembly will meet this month to approve a party-proposed slate for the Council of State, which Raul Castro is expected to head for his second term. Council of State members must be deputies. The general election cycle began last year with the election of more than 15,000 ward delegates in the only vote in which residents choose between two or more candidates. Party-controlled commissions then selected candidates for provincial assemblies and the single-chamber national assembly, at least 50 percent of whom must be ward delegates and the remainder officials and personalities from the arts, sports and other sectors. The National Assembly usually meets just twice a year for a week of committee and plenary meetings, though deputies remain engaged between sessions while working their normal jobs and can be relieved from work for assembly tasks.

Select the topic that this about: Microsoft Corp. #39;s MSN Music online download service fired another salvo this week at Apple rival iTunes Music Store by announcing its expansion into new European countries.","completion":"The topic of discussion is the expansion of Microsoft Corp.'s online music download service, MSN Music, into new European countries, as a direct competition to Apple's popular iTunes Music Store. This strategic move by Microsoft aimed at capturing a share in the growing online music market and challenging Apple's dominance in the sector. MSN Music was an online music store that Microsoft Corporation launched in 2004. It was specifically designed to compete with Apple's iTunes Music Store, which had become the industry leader in digital music sales. MSN Music allowed users to purchase songs individually or as part of an album, download and listen to them on their computers or portable devices, and manage their digital music library. As part of its expansion strategy, Microsoft decided to enhance MSN Music's offerings and services in several new European countries. This decision was made to ensure a broader audience and customer base for the platform, allowing Microsoft to compete more effectively with iTunes Music Store in the European market. This expansion incorporated numerous factors, such as: 1. Localization: Microsoft focused on adapting MSN Music to the specific preferences and needs of customers in each country by offering localized content, including popular songs and albums from local artists, as well as international hits. This ensured that MSN Music would be more appealing to local users, by providing a tailored experience based on their tastes and interests. 2. Pricing and currencies: To make the online music store more accessible and user-friendly, Microsoft adjusted the pricing of songs and albums on MSN Music to match the local currency, thus making it easier for customers to understand and compare costs. This approach also eliminated potential confusion arising from currency conversions. 3. Partnerships: To facilitate its expansion, Microsoft formed partnerships with local music rights holders, record labels, and distributors. These partnerships enabled MSN Music to offer an extensive range of music, tapping into the resources of both local and international artists, thereby increasing its library's appeal to a broader audience. 4. Marketing and promotional efforts: Microsoft invested in marketing campaigns and promotional activities to raise awareness and create excitement around the MSN Music brand in the targeted European countries. This included advertising, events, collaborations with local influencers, and social media initiatives, all aimed at attracting users to the platform and increasing downloads. 5. Platform compatibility: To ensure seamless integration with the existing Microsoft ecosystem, MSN Music was made compatible with Windows Media Player, Xbox, and other Microsoft devices. This allowed users to sync their music library easily across their devices, thus providing a convenient and integrated experience. Microsoft's expansion of MSN Music into new European countries was a strategic move that directly targeted Apple's iTunes Music Store, aspiring to challenge its dominance in the digital music market and secure a larger share of this rapidly growing industry. However, despite Microsoft's efforts, MSN Music ultimately did not have the same staying power as iTunes, and the service was eventually shut down in 2008."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Anti-Nazi Resolution UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States was one of three countries to vote against a U.N. resolution condemning the glorification of Nazism on Thursday, citing freedom of speech issues and concerns that Russia was using it to carry out political attacks against its neighbors. The resolution entitled “Combating glorification of Nazism, Neo-Nazism and other practices that contribute to fueling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,” was approved by the U.N.’s human rights committee on Friday with 131 in favor, 3 against with 48 abstentions. Ukraine and Palau were the other no votes. “We condemn without reservation all forms of religious and ethnic intolerance or hatred at home and around the world,” said Deputy U.S. Representative to the Economic and Social Council Stefanie Amadeo, explaining the U.S. vote. “However, due to this resolution’s overly narrow scope and politicized nature, and because it calls for unacceptable limits on the fundamental freedom of expression, the United States cannot support it,” Amadeo said. She said the U.S. also disagrees with the resolution’s willingness to curb freedom of expression even while sharing its concerns about the rise of hate speech around the world. “This resolution’s recommendations to limit freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right to peaceful assembly contravene the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and must be opposed,” Amadeo said. Unlike resolutions in the Security Council, resolutions in General Assembly committees are not considered legally binding.

This resolution wants to stop people from saying good things about Nazis and other groups that are mean to people because of their race or where they come from.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What type of music was \\"Big Fun\\"? Detroit techno is an offshoot of Chicago house music which developed in the early and mid-1980s. One of the earliest hits was \\"Big Fun\\" by Inner City. Detroit techno developed as the DJ The Electrifying Mojo did his radio program, which fused eclectic sounds into the signature Detroit techno sound. This sound, also influenced by European electronica (Kraftwerk, Art of Noise), Japanese synthpop (Yellow Magic Orchestra), early B-boy (breakdancing) Hip-Hop (Man Parrish, Soul Sonic Force) and Italo disco (Doctor's Cat, Ris, Klein M.B.O.), was further pioneered by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson, known as the Belleville Three.

This record was played on Chicago's Hot Mix 5 Radio DJ mix show and in Chicago clubs. A year later, Transmat released \\"Strings of Life\\". Transmat Records also released such as 1988's \\"Wiggin\\". As well, Derrick May had releases on Kool Kat Records and many remixes for underground and mainstream recording artists.

Media playback is not supported on this device After losing the first leg of their semi-final 1-0 in Villarreal, Liverpool produced a dominant display at Anfield on Thursday to win 3-1 on aggregate. \\"When you perform like we did then you want to have it all and that is what we will try,\\" said Klopp. \\"We will go there and try to do everything for this wonderful club.\\" The match - at St Jakob-Park in Basel, Switzerland - will be Liverpool's first European final since losing 2-1 to AC Milan in the Champions League in 2007. The Reds have won eight of the 11 European finals they have appeared in - five of seven in the European Cup/Champions League and three of three in the Uefa Cup/Europa League. Should they beat Sevilla, who are trying to win the Europa League for the third successive season, they will join the Spanish side as the most successful in the competition with four victories and earn a place in next season's Champions League. \\"I don't know what it means that it is nine years between Liverpool's last final,\\" said Klopp, who replaced Brendan Rodgers as manager in October. \\"A lot of teams want to go to finals, it is not too easy, but it is a real opportunity and we will take the opportunity.\\" An early Bruno Soriano own goal set Liverpool on their way, before second-half strikes from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana completed victory over their Spanish opponents, who finished the match with 10 men after Victor Ruiz was sent off. Liverpool, Champions League winners in 2005, were backed by impressive support from the moment the team bus arrived at the stadium. Hundreds of fans packed Anfield Road to welcome their players and continued their vociferous support throughout the game. Klopp says as many as 100,000 Liverpool fans could travel to Switzerland for the final, though FC Basel's stadium can only hold 35,000. Klopp did not name a recognised striker in his starting line-up for the first leg, with Sturridge left on the bench. However, he restored the England international to the first XI and was rewarded with an impressive performance. Sturridge scored Liverpool's second after being the closest Reds player to Soriano when he put through his own net - and he was also involved in Lallana's goal. Klopp said the 26-year-old had a \\"great game\\", adding: \\"When Daniel Sturridge is fit he is an unbelievable striker, but even he needs players to play with and I know about his quality, I knew before I came here. Great player.\\" Liverpool produced another memorable European performance at Anfield, after coming from 3-1 down to knock Borussia Dortmund out in the previous round. It means Klopp is into his second final with the club since taking charge just seven months ago. They lost on penalties to Manchester City in the League Cup final in February. \\"In 2016, the team have shown a lot of times what they could be capable of in the future so that's a good sign and that is more important for me as a manager,\\" said Klopp. Former Liverpool striker Michael Owen said on BT Sport: \\"Over the last few months we've really seen something special. \\"There's such high energy levels, the pressing we all knew Jurgen Klopp was going to bring over. But he's just improving players - the likes of Adam Lallana, Simon Mignolet and Dejan Lovren - as well. \\"There's special times ahead. It's almost like they are unbeatable here.

There are several funny moments, and some interesting points, but don't go into this expecting an even-handed discussion of religion. This is what I consider to be the worst kind of documentary - Everything is arranged ahead of time and in editing to provide you with the opinion of the director, rather than letting you make your own decision. EDITING - It's very chopped up, inter-spliced with clips from pop culture and the media to reinforce the point. The interviewee barely has a chance to finish a sentence before he is interrupted by the editing. The only people given a fair chance to speak their mind are those who say what Bill Maher wants them to say. Once someone deviates from the gospel according to Maher, they get edited. INTERVIEWEES - They are meant to represent the absolute MOST extremist religions. From the TV evangelical to the ultimate Jewish stereotype, to a TRUCK STOP chapel (Seriously. A TRUCK STOP CHAPEL). He's picked the worst money-grabbers, the heavy extremists, and those who don't have the budget to say no to pick on. And when he does get a good person to interview, he edits the hell out of them. STEREOTYPING - All religions are portrayed as stereotypes. Especially hard hit are the Muslims. During the Muslim segment, he barely gives anyone the chance to speak before interrupting them either himself, or through editing in pieces with suicide bombers. ALL Muslims are portrayed as gun-toting extremists through the editing, and none of the people interviewed is edited fairly. ENDING - The message at the end is INCREDIBLY heavy-handed, and while it is an interesting idea, it's not presented with fairness to the countless people who are not religious extremists. Bill Maher explains himself while clips of destruction play in the foreground. This literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous, and that it will destroy the world. He also states that everyone involved in religion is stupid. With the faults to the film, it has some good points, and the humor, while very unfair, is actually funny. But know going in, it is a very one-sided view, Bill Maher's view, of religion. He's not discovering anything.

So, (2728*z - 2874*z) = -3796 simplifies to (-146*z) = -3796 Step 3: Solve for 'z' To isolate 'z' on one side of the equation, we can divide both sides by -146.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife.

When a woman entered a room, it was considered rude for a man to offer his seat to her because the cushion might still be warm. People thought that you could digest food better in the dark, so the dining room was often located in the basement. It was considered improper to look into someone's bedroom, so most bedrooms were on the second or third floor. People went to great lengths to hide their water closets from view. In some homes, they were behind a curtain or screen, in a separate part of the house or even outside. A lot of men used macassar oil to slick back their hair. In order to stop this grease from sticking to the furniture, pieces of material called antimacassars were placed over the backs of chairs. For a lady, to show her ankles was considered taboo . ks5u Many people kept a hedgehog in the basement so it could eat insects.

Does the sentence \\"Epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Are the changes then presented, permanent?\\"","completion":"The sentence \\"Epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life.\\" partially answers the question \\"Are the changes then presented, permanent?\\" But to give a more detailed and comprehensive answer, it is important to understand the concept of epigenetics and the nature of epigenetic changes. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression and function that are not caused by alterations in the DNA sequence itself but rather by chemical modifications to DNA and histone proteins or the action of small regulatory RNAs. These modifications act like \\"switches\\" that turn genes on or off, and consequently, they affect how genes are expressed. Epigenetic changes can be influenced by various factors, including environmental factors, lifestyle choices, and exposure to toxins. Now, let's address the question of whether these changes are permanent or not. Epigenetic changes can display different degrees of stability and persistence. Some changes may last for a relatively short period, while others might persist through multiple cell divisions or even for the entire life of an organism. Moreover, some epigenetic changes can even be passed on to future generations through a phenomenon called epigenetic inheritance. There are three primary categories of epigenetic modifications that determine the stability and permanence of the changes: 1. Temporary changes: Some epigenetic changes are transient and can be reversed with time or under specific conditions. For example, certain changes related to environmental exposures might only last for a few hours or days before the cells return to their normal state. 2. Cell division-dependent changes: Some epigenetic changes are more stable and can be maintained through successive cell divisions, meaning they remain for the rest of the cell's life. This type of change is more likely to persist until the cell dies or differentiates into a specialized cell type. 3. Inheritance-associated changes: The most stable epigenetic changes can be passed on to future generations, as they can be transmitted during the formation of gametes (egg and sperm cells). These changes can be considered semi-permanent in the sense that they might persist across generations but can still be susceptible to reversal or modification under certain conditions. In summary, the sentence provided offers a partially valid answer to the question about the permanence of epigenetic changes. Epigenetic changes can range from temporary to long-lasting, and in some instances, these changes can even be inherited by future generations. However, one must keep in mind that epigenetic changes are adaptable, and their permanence depends on various factors, including stability, reversibility, and their transmission through cell divisions and generations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Information: - The Local Group is the galaxy group that includes the Milky Way. The Local Group comprises more than 54 galaxies, most of them dwarf galaxies. Its gravitational center is located somewhere between the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. The Local Group covers a diameter of (about 10 meters) and has a binary (dumbbell) distribution. The group itself is a part of the larger Virgo Supercluster, which in turn may be a part of the Laniakea Supercluster. - The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224, is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs (2.5 million light-years) from Earth. It is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way and was often referred to as the Great Andromeda Nebula in older texts. It received its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which was named after the mythological princess Andromeda. - In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with Earth. All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances are unknown or unimportant. - A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names. - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - A dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) is a term in astronomy applied to low luminosity galaxies that are companions to the Milky Way and to the similar systems that are companions to the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). While similar to dwarf elliptical galaxies in appearance and properties such as little to no gas or dust or recent star formation, they are approximately spheroidal in shape, generally lower luminosity, and are recognized only as satellite galaxies in the Local Group. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Andromeda V is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy about 2.52 Mly away in the constellation Andromeda . Andromeda V was discovered by Armandroff et al . and published in 1998 after their analysis of the digitized version of the second Palomar Sky Survey . The metallicity of Andromeda V is above the average metallicity to luminosity ratio of the Local Group 's dwarf galaxies . - The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. The descriptive \\"milky\\" is derived from the appearance from Earth of the galaxy a band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term \\"Milky Way\\" is a translation of the Latin ', from the Greek (', \\"milky circle\\"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies. What is the relationship between 'andromeda v' and 'andromeda galaxy'? A:","completion":"Andromeda V is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy found within the constellation Andromeda, approximately 2.52 million light-years away from Earth.

Acute lung injury is a life-threatening condition characterized by surfactant dysfunction and raised secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity. Varespladib is a sPLA2 inhibitor shown to be effective in animal models of acute lung injury. We aimed at investigating the effect of co-administration of surfactant and varespladib on sPLA2 activity. Alveolar macrophages were cultured and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and then treated with either varespladib, surfactant, varespladib followed by surfactant or nothing. sPLA2 activity, free fatty acids, tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-) and protein concentrations were measured in culture supernatants. Treatment with varespladib (p=0.019) and varespladib + surfactant (p=0.013), reduced the enzyme activity by approximately 15% from the basal level measured in the untreated cultures. Surfactant, varespladib and varespladib + surfactant, respectively decreased free fatty acids by -45% (p=0.045), - 62% (p=0.009) and -48% (p=0.015), from the baseline concentration of the untreated cultures. Varespladib and poractant- co-administration reduces sPLA2 activity and free fatty acids release in cultured rat alveolar macrophages, although a clear drug synergy was not evident. Since co-administration may be useful to reduce inflammation and surfactant inactivation in acute lung injury, further in vivo studies are warranted to verify its clinical usefulness.","completion":"Task: Generate a question from the given context passage such that its answer is the shortest continuous span from the passage.

I can use this background: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention. Now, I have a new situation: Two neighbors Paul and Dean studied toghether often. this week they got together and Paul started studying about the Gaia hypothesis, while Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Answer this question please: Which person studied more about the carbon dioxide levels?","completion":"Based on the background information provided and the new situation, Paul studied more about the carbon dioxide levels. This is because Paul was studying the Gaia hypothesis, which talks about the Earth as a self-regulating and living organism, and includes the discussion of how the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are regulated by the biosphere, through processes like plant growth. On the other hand, Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which deals with the fundamental principles of physics, specifically focusing on gravity, space, and time. The Theory of Relativity is not directly related to the study of carbon dioxide levels or the processes occurring in the Earth's biosphere, as it deals with a different area of scientific inquiry. In conclusion, Paul, who studied the Gaia hypothesis, would have learned more about the carbon dioxide levels, as this subject is within the scope of his chosen area of study, whereas Dean's focus on Einstein's Theory of Relativity does not include this specific topic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Two fifth-grade boys armed with a stolen semi-automatic gun, ammunition clip and knife plotted to kill a classmate in Washington state but were thwarted when another student informed a school employee, authorities said Thursday. The two boys, who told police they considered the girl rude and annoying, won't be tried as adults and will be in court next Wednesday for a capacity hearing, said Tim Rasmussen, the Stevens County prosecuting attorney. The two boys, ages 10 and 11, told authorities that they were also going to kill, or \\"get,\\" six more students at Fort Colville Elementary School in Colville, Washington, and even identified them from a class list provided by school employees, according to court documents. The boys' plan called for the older to stab the girl off-campus with a 3.25-inch knife last week, and the younger boy would scare off any responders with a .45-caliber Remington 1911 semi-automatic handgun, court documents said. The younger boy had been in \\"a short dating relationship\\" with the girl, but he told authorities that \\"she's rude and always made fun of me and my friends,\\" court papers said. \\"Yes, I just want her dead,\\" the younger boy told authorities. He brought the gun and knife to school, documents said. The older boy had been friends with the girl for several months, but he wanted to kill her because she picked on and annoyed him, court papers said. \\"Yes, and I wanted to kill her alone at first,\\" the older boy told a police officer. The officer noticed in his interview with the older boy that he \\"did not display any emotion or remorse during the interview,\\" court papers said. The younger boy took the gun from his older brother by finding a hidden key to the gun case kept in the brother's bedroom, and the older brother told authorities that he stole the firearm from their dead grandfather's home, court papers said. The older brother is also a juvenile, Rasmussen said. The two boys told another student two weeks earlier about the plot to kill the girl and were going to pay him 80 to keep it secret, the court filings said. The two boys were going to kill the other six students by luring them away from school one at a time, court papers said.

Answer:","completion":"The white horse on the Nigerian coat of arms represents dignity, honor, strength, and pride - qualities that exemplify the spirit and character of the Nigerian nation. The white horse is an important and symbolic element of the coat of arms, which was officially adopted upon Nigeria's independence from the United Kingdom on October 1, 1960. The coat of arms conveys the essence and identity of the Nigerian people and reflects various aspects of the country's historical, political, and cultural values. The Nigerian coat of arms is a visual representation of Nigeria's sovereignty and unity, consisting of a black shield with a wavy silver band on a green and white field, supported by two white horses on either side. Above the shield, there is a red eagle, standing on a torse (a twisted band), and below the shield is a scroll bearing the national motto: \\"Unity and Faith, Peace and Progress\\". The white color of the horse signifies purity, innocence, and peace. The importance of peace and unity in a diverse country like Nigeria cannot be overstated, and the white horse serves as a constant reminder of this need. The presence of two white horses, one on either side of the shield, symbolizes the cohesive strength, collaboration, and stability that is necessary for Nigeria to thrive as a nation. The link between horses and dignity or honor is deeply rooted in Nigeria's history and folklore. Historically, horses have been associated with nobility, warriors, and rulers, as they were crucial in battles and frequently used as a means of transportation. In traditional Nigerian society, owning a horse was a sign of wealth, power, and high social standing. This connection to Nigerian heritage only serves to reinforce the symbolic importance of the white horse on the coat of arms. Furthermore, the horse's well-known strength and perseverance resonate with Nigeria's struggle for independence from colonial rule, as well as the challenges the country has faced and continues to face since attaining that independence. The presence of the white horse on the coat of arms thus encourages Nigerians to demonstrate resilience, determination, and courage in overcoming their challenges. In summary, the white horse on the Nigerian coat of arms represents the lofty ideals of dignity, honor, strength, and pride that underpin the country's national identity. It reminds Nigerians of the continuing need for unity, peace, and perseverance as the nation navigates its way through the challenges of the modern world. The white horse also reflects Nigeria's cultural heritage and historical values, lending further weight to the symbolic power and significance of this emblematic element."},{"prompt":"Q: Is this product review positive?

Know where else Waldo is not.\\"","completion":"Title: Mastering the Art of Finding Waldo: Landmarks, Focus and Knowing Where Not to Look Introduction For decades, Where's Waldo, or Where’s Wally as he is known in some countries, has been a staple in waiting rooms, classrooms, and living rooms worldwide. The illustrated books following the bespectacled, red-striped adventurer have provided hours of amusement to the young and the young-at-heart. The challenge? To locate the elusive Waldo, his friends, and other items cleverly hidden amidst a sea of chaotic illustrations teeming with distractions. While it may appear that there's no rhyme or reason to Waldo's comings and goings, there is, in fact, a method to the madness. By understanding a few key strategies when searching for Waldo, you'll be able to spot him like a pro. In this article, we'll explore the importance of focusing on Waldo's clothes, the power of landmarks, and the value of knowing where else Waldo isn't. Spot Waldo's Clothes Waldo's signature ensemble remains constant throughout his adventures – a red and white stripe hat, shirt, and trademark black rimmed circular glasses. These distinct features make him slightly easier to identify amidst the immense clutter and chaos of the crowd. 1. Familiarize Yourself with His Attire: To boost your chances of discovering Waldo's whereabouts, spend some time studying his attire so that you can easily spot it amongst various illustrations. Pay close attention to the pattern and layout of his stripes, as well as the shape of his glasses. This will help you quickly assess whether or not your eye is actually drawn to Waldo or a cleverly placed decoy. 2. Scan for Red and White Stripes: Use a systematic approach and scan the illustration from top to bottom and side to side. Focus on narrowing down areas containing people wearing red and white striped clothing. This will significantly reduce the amount of illustration you have to search through. 3. Watch Out for Decoys: The illustrations are specifically designed to throw off seekers with similar-looking characters, accessories, or patterns. Keep Waldo's specific attire in mind to ensure you're not misled by these decoys. Focus on Landmarks Illustrations in Where's Waldo often center around detailed landmarks rich with easily distinguishable features. Use the presence of these landmarks to your advantage: 1. Utilize Landmark Boundaries: Not only do landmarks provide you with definitive boundaries for your search area, but they also help you remember which areas you've previously scanned. This helps prevent you from wasting time revisiting the same places. 2. Organize Your Search: Divide the page into sections based on these focal points and explore one landmark at a time. This allows for a more methodical search with increased chances of success. 3. Look for Patterns: Be aware of any patterns or themes associated with the landmarks within the illustration. Characters and objects may share common features or colors with the surroundings. Recognizing these patterns can improve the chances of spotting Waldo in the midst of a busy scene. Know Where Else Waldo is Not Elimination is a powerful technique in the quest for Waldo. Being able to exclude particular areas or groups of people from your search speeds up the process of honing in on Waldo. Some crucial approaches to this include: 1. Avoid Irrelevant Characters: Illustrations usually include various characters or groups of people that are unrelated to Waldo. By concentrating on the unique features more commonly associated with Waldo, you can disregard these areas, streamlining your search. 2. Beware of Tricks: Waldo's creator, Martin Handford, has been known to include tricks in his illustrations. For instance, drawing Waldo's clothes on another character or showing only a small portion of him sticking out from behind a large object. Keep this in mind as you search to avoid being misled by these tricks. 3. Trust Your Instincts: If you've searched an area and are confident Waldo isn't hiding there, move on. Trusting your intuition and eliminating areas will assist in narrowing down the possible locations faster. Conclusion With these tips at your fingertips, you're well on your way to mastering the art of finding Waldo. By focusing on his distinctive clothes, using landmarks to aid your search, and eliminating areas where he's not, you'll become a seasoned Waldo-hunter in no time. The next time you pick up a copy of the classic books, put these tactics to the test and watch your success rate soar.

Review: Like with any movie genre, there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies. If you asked me to name a good gangster movie, I'd have dozens to choose from. If you asked me to name a bad gangster movie, probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since I saw the film for the first and I promise you, the last time. That film is \\"The General\\", unrelated to the 1926 silent film of the same name. This is a very dry, very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story (it's more than easy to follow) but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavor.Like \\"Goodfellas\\" (1990) and \\"American Gangster\\" (2007)two superior mob movies\\"The General\\" is based on real people and true events. The film revolves around an Irish criminal named Martin Cahill (Brendan Gleeson) who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult. Meanwhile, the police led by an inspector named Kenny (Jon Voight) try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict (or kill) him.Perhaps because it's a film in the same category as the marvelous \\"Goodfellas\\" (1990) and the first two \\"Godfather\\" films, I was expecting too much from \\"The General.\\" But that may be going too easy on it. This would have been a bad film had I not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being swamped by boredom in this oater and its far-too-stretched running time of screaming bad scenes. Let's start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented. For some reason, director John Boorman and cinematographer Seamus Deasy selected to film this movie in black-and-white while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a full-fledged color film. Now I have nothing against b/w pictures, not even ones made in modern-day times. \\"Schindler's List\\" (1993) was more than ninety percent filmed in black-and-white and it's a masterpiece. \\"The General\\", made just five years after \\"Schindler's List\\" is not. The cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very video-game-like quality that I found simply annoying. The filmmakers were obviously going for a realist's documentary-like style, like \\"Schindler's List\\" did, but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time, too much like a classic-style motion picture. Performances in the film range from passable to poor. Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles, but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting. The sound design is also very primitive, probably in an attempt to give it a 40s crime-noir appeal, but that also fails because again, it's made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place.But the worst thing that occurs is that there's not onenot onecharacter in the film that I felt any emotions or opinions for. In fact, for every moment of every scene, the only thought going through my head was \\"okayso what?\\" Moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and time-consuming here. I did not sympathize or hate the Brendan Gleeson character because the way the Cahill character is written is simply flat and dull. Gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real Martin Cahill obviously did. If a character is killed off (as they always are in gangster films), we feel nothing. No remorse, no relief, no surprise, nothing. We just say \\"so what?\\" And that's all I did during the entire running time of this very flimsy, very poorly-made crime film.

The retina is the part of your eye that is also known as the \\"sensing tissue.\\" Retinitis may be caused by a number of different infectious agents. Retinitis, also called Retinitis pigmentosa, has a prevalence of one in every 2,500-7,000 people. This condition is one of the leading causes that leads to blindness in patients in the age range of 20–60 years old. Now, I have a new situation: Local hospital has launched a program to check if a patient has Retinitis. Resident ophthalmologist David is in charge of this program. In the first day of the program he checked two patients, patient A and patient B. The test result showed that patient A had Retinitis, but patient B did not have Retinitis. Then next day David checked two other patients, patient C and patient D. Patient C was 40 years old, but patient D was 80 years old. He found both patient C and D had Retinitis. Answer this question please: For which patient Retinitis will not be one of the leading causes of blindness, patient C or patient D? A:","completion":"Retinitis can indeed be a leading cause of blindness in patients aged 20 to 60 years old. In the given scenario, patient C is 40 years old, and patient D is 80 years old. As Retinitis is one of the leading causes of blindness in the age range 20-60 years old, it implies that Retinitis may have a significantly higher impact on patient C rather than patient D. There can be a variety of reasons why Retinitis may not be among the leading causes of blindness for patient D, who is 80 years old. With increasing age, there are several other conditions that can contribute to vision loss, such as age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, glaucoma, or diabetic retinopathy. It is possible that one or more of these age-related eye conditions could have a greater likelihood of causing blindness in patient D when compared to Retinitis. It is essential to recognize that each patient is unique, and their individual medical history must be taken into account when assessing the risks and causes of blindness. While general trends and statistics are useful to inform medical practice, a personalized approach to each patient's care is vital to maximize their health outcomes. In conclusion, Retinitis would not be one of the leading causes of blindness for patient D, the 80-year-old patient. Instead, other age-related eye conditions are more likely to contribute to vision loss in patient D. Patient C, on the other hand, who is 40 years old, falls within the age range where Retinitis is considered a leading cause of blindness."},{"prompt":"Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who is in complete shock? , can you please find it?

Option A: Suzi hoped the cat would stay in the tree. This option seems to imply that Suzi wants her cat to remain in the situation where it is stuck. This is contradictory, as Sue has already called the fire department for help, indicating she wishes the cat to be safe and rescued.

This guide stands beside you every step of the way - from the moment you receive the boarding announcement, to when you finally take your seat on the aircraft. Follow these simple steps for a smooth and hassle-free boarding experience, letting you focus on the more important aspects of your trip. Step 1: Wait for the Boarding Announcement Keep an eye on the airport monitors and listen to the public address system for the boarding announcement for your flight. It's important to be patient, as boarding times and gates may change unexpectedly. Have your boarding pass and identification ready to avoid any delays or disruptions as you make your way to the plane. Step 2: Get Your Boarding Pass Checked Once your flight is called, locate your boarding gate and present your boarding pass and identification to the airline personnel. They will verify your details, and upon confirmation, you will be given the green light to proceed. Step 3: Walk Down the Hallway That Leads Up to Your Plane Now that you have permission to board, follow the designated path towards your aircraft. As you walk down the hallway (known as the jet bridge), give yourself a moment to appreciate the journey you are about to embark on. Step 4: Enter the Aircraft Upon entering the aircraft, you will likely be greeted by a member of the flight crew. They may ask to see your boarding pass once more in order to direct you towards your assigned seat. Be sure to ask for any guidance or assistance if needed. Step 5: Stow Your Carry-On Items It's essential to keep the aisle clear for other passengers to board quickly and safely. Locate the overhead compartment near your seat, and securely stow your carry-on luggage. Place any smaller belongings beneath the seat in front of you. Remember to be attentive to the size and weight restrictions for carry-on items established by your airline to avoid any issues during boarding.

The first obstacle he faced was the sheer size of the statue, which not only dominated the visual landscape but also made maneuvering it towards and through the entrance of his home a formidable task. He carefully measured the dimensions of the statue - its height, width, and depth - and compared them to the dimensions of his home's entryway and the available indoor space. After considering various placements and trajectories, he realized that disassembling the statue into smaller components would be essential for ensuring a smooth and safe passage through the confined spaces. The next challenge was the unwieldiness of the statue, as its unique and intricate design with protruding limbs and elaborate details made it a delicate and cumbersome object to handle. Being an art enthusiast, the man understood the importance of preserving the masterpiece and knew that he had to avoid any damage that might devalue the work or mar its beauty. He gathered all the necessary materials such as bubble wrap, soft blankets, packing tape, and padding to protect the fragile areas and surfaces of the statue during the relocation process. Besides the physical complexity of the statue, its hefty weight proved to be a significant concern. Fearing that relocating the statue on his own could lead to potential injury or damage to the art piece, the man decided to seek help from friends and family who could provide additional strength and support during the moving process. He also invested in renting essential equipment like dollies, ramps, and moving straps to distribute the load evenly and minimize the stress on their bodies. Once the manpower and tools were in place, the man went on to develop a step-by-step plan to ensure that the various aspects of the relocation process were methodically executed. This included a detailed timeline that accounted for the time needed to disassemble, pack, and unpack the statue, as well as the time required for rest breaks and any unexpected setbacks. He also meticulously outlined the action plan, assigning specific roles and responsibilities to each member of the team, ensuring that everyone understood their part in the process. Upon executing the plan, the team worked diligently and in unison to disassemble, wrap, and move each component of the statue with utmost care and caution. They navigated through the narrow corridors and tight corners of the home, overcoming the spatial limitations and physical hurdles. Finally, upon reaching the designated area inside the house, they proceeded to reassemble the statue, making sure that each part was accurately aligned and secured back into place. In the end, through thorough planning, careful execution, and teamwork, the man successfully managed to store the statue inside his home. The colossal art piece transformed the ambiance of the space, engulfing it with an aura of grandeur and elegance that left an indelible impression on all who entered. The man stood back, admiring the marvelous work of art, grateful for the support of his friends and family, as well as the tools and strategies that made the challenging task possible."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In Hill's prologue, a scientist, Dr. Eric Zinthrop (Michael Mark), is fired from his job at a honey farm for experimenting with wasps. The founder and owner of a large cosmetics company, Janice Starlin (Susan Cabot), is disturbed when her firm's sales begin to drop after it becomes apparent to her customer base that she is aging. Zinthrop has been able to extract enzymes from the royal jelly of the queen wasp that can reverse the aging process. Janice agrees to fund further research, at great cost, provided she can serve as his human subject. Displeased with the slowness of the results, she breaks into the scientist's laboratory after hours and injects herself with extra doses of the formula. Zinthrop becomes aware that some of the test creatures are becoming violent and goes to warn Janice, but before he can reach anyone, he gets into a car accident. He is thus temporarily missing and Janice goes through great trouble to find him, eventually taking over his care. Janice continues her clandestine use of the serum and sheds 20 years in a single weekend, but soon discovers that she is periodically transformed into a murderous, wasp-like creature.

Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Detailed Instructions: This task is about creating an unanswerable question based on a given passage. Construct a question that looks relevant to the given context but is unanswerable. Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions: (i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage (ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer (iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question (iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Problem:Passage: Ion gauges are used in ultrahigh vacuum. They come in two types: hot cathode and cold cathode. In the hot cathode version an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10−3 torr to 10−10 torr. The principle behind cold cathode version is the same, except that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge. Cold cathode gauges are accurate from 10−2 torr to 10−9 torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum. The composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be unpredictable, so a mass spectrometer must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge for accurate measurement. Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Creating questions that require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage. Usage: What is the maximum distance between the ion gauge and the mass spectrometer for accurate measurement? This question requires information about the distance constraint, which is not mentioned in the passage. So it meets the criteria. Part #2: Creating questions that require information beyond what is provided in the passage. Usage: How much does a typical ion gauge cost? To answer this question, the cost of an ion gauge would need to be provided in the passage. Since it is not, this question meets the criteria for requiring additional information. Part #3: Replacing an existing entity, number, or date with another and using it in the question. Usage: Are hot cathode ion gauges accurate up to 10−5 torr? The passage mentions that hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10−3 torr to 10−10 torr. However, it doesn't specify the accuracy at 10−5 torr. This question meets this part's criteria because it uses a different number than the ones mentioned in the passage. Part #4: Creating a question that is answerable from the passage but then replacing a word with an antonym or inserting/removing negation words. Usage: Does the cold cathode ion gauge operate without the use of a high voltage electrical discharge? This question can be answered from the passage, as it states that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge in cold cathode gauges. But by adding the word \\"without,\\" the question becomes unanswerable based on the passage. Therefore, it meets the criteria for this part."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question: What season was it that the Portland Trail Blazers acquired the identical twin brother of Horace Grant, the same season that Chris Dudley had an ankle injury? Answer:","completion":"The season when the Portland Trail Blazers acquired Harvey Grant, the identical twin brother of Horace Grant, and when Chris Dudley experienced an ankle injury was the 1996-1997 NBA season. During the 1996 offseason, the Portland Trail Blazers signed Harvey Grant as a free agent. Harvey, a 6'8\\" forward, had a solid NBA career, playing for the Washington Bullets (now Wizards) and the Chicago Bulls before joining his brother Horace in the league. Harvey had a versatile skillset, with the ability to shoot from the perimeter, rebound, and play solid defense. In the 1996-1997 season, the Portland Trail Blazers roster included other notable players such as Kenny Anderson, Arvydas Sabonis, Clifford Robinson, and Isaiah Rider. Coached by P.J. Carlesimo, the team had a mix of experienced veterans and promising young talents. During this same season, Chris Dudley, the Trail Blazers' 6'11\\" center known for his shot-blocking and rebounding abilities, suffered an ankle injury. This injury forced him to miss a significant portion of the season, limiting his contributions to the team. In the 57 games that Dudley played that season, he still managed to average 4.5 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks per game. Despite the injury to Dudley and the addition of Harvey Grant, the Trail Blazers finished the 1996-1997 season with a 49-33 record, placing them 4th in the Western Conference. The team advanced to the playoffs, where they faced the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round. Unfortunately, the Trail Blazers were defeated in four games, ending their playoff run early. In summary, the Portland Trail Blazers acquired Harvey Grant and experienced a significant ankle injury to Chris Dudley during the 1996-1997 NBA season. Despite these challenges, the team still managed to achieve a winning record and participate in the playoffs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The word \\"huh?\\" is in worldwide use, a study found. Researchers discovered that languages spoken in countries from Ghana and Laos to Iceland and Italy all include \\"huh?\\", or something that sounds very like it. They said that while the study may sound silly, the word is an absolutely necessary part of speech. Without it and similar words, it would be impossible to show that we haven't heard or understood what had been said and this would lead to constant misunderstandings. But while other words used in the same context, such as \\"sorry\\" or \\"what\\", vary widely across languages, \\"huh?\\" remains unchanged. The Dutch researchers carefully studied ten languages from around the world, including Siwu, which is spoken in Ghana, and an Australian Aboriginal language, as well as Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Mandarin Chinese. They analysed tapes of recorded conversations for words that sounded like \\"huh?\\" and were used to request that whatever had just been said be repeated. All contained a version of \\"huh?\\". The word was also found in another 21 languages. While there were subtle differences in each country, all sounded basically the same. This is surprising because normally unrelated languages will use very different words to describe the same thing. For instance, the Japanese for \\"dog\\" is \\"inu\\", while the French is \\"chien\\". It is thought that languages around the world have developed their own version of \\"huh?\\" because the sound is quick and simple to form, as well as being easily understood. The researchers, said that it might seem unimportant to carry out scientific research into a word like \\"huh?\\" but in fact this little word is an essential tool in human communication. They also have an answer for those who claim that \\"huh?\\" isn't a word. They say that it qualifies because of the small differences in its pronunciation in different languages.

I can use this background: You generally can’t see, smell, taste, hear, or feel radiation. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one pictured in the Figure below , contains atoms of a gas that is ionized if it encounters radiation. When this happens, the gas atoms change to ions that can carry an electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below. Now, I have a new situation: Keith landed a job with the EPA. As part of his training he needed to learn how the Geiger counter works. To learn more about the counter he tested it in three different locations, location A, location B, and location C. Location A had very high radiation; location B had low radiation; and location C didn't have any radiation. Keith learned how the counter works in locations with varying degrees of radiation.

Unfortunately, the cafe did not live up to the hype, leaving me and my friends with a bitter taste in our mouths - both literally and figuratively. First and foremost, the ambiance of the establishment was less than desirable. The lighting was too dim, making it difficult for us to read the menus or even see the faces of our fellow diners. The seating arrangements were cramped and uncomfortable. It seemed as though the management was attempting to pack as many customers into the space as humanly possible, without any regard for the customers' comfort level. Moreover, the music was played at an unbearably high volume, making conversation among our group an immense challenge. Upon finally being able to place our orders, we had hoped that the food would make up for the less-than-stellar environment. Sadly, the dishes that arrived at our table were lackluster and in dire need of improvement. The avocado toast I had been looking forward to was served on stale bread, with hardly any avocado to speak of and seasoning that did not mesh well in any way. My friend's club sandwich was piled high with cold cuts but proved to be lacking in any sort of flavor. The only thing that truly stood out was the portion of fries that accompanied the sandwich; however, they were so over-salted they were nearly inedible. Beyond this, the prices reflected a much higher level of quality than what was actually provided, leaving us feeling as though we got significantly less value for our money. As for the service, it was, simply put, subpar. Although they were busy, it was clear that the staff were overwhelmed and disorganized. We were left waiting for long periods between ordering, receiving our food, and asking for the bill. At one point, we were on the verge of leaving before our food even arrived. Attentiveness from the staff was virtually non-existent, and even when they were at our table, they seemed distracted and disinterested in their work. Overall, the entire experience was a significant letdown. Although I don't like to write negative reviews, I must be honest in stating that I cannot recommend the Hideaway Cafe to others. From the chaotic atmosphere to the uninspired dishes and lackluster service, there were hardly any redeeming qualities to speak of. I hope that the management considers these concerns and works to improve their establishment in the future, but for now, I will be seeking out other dining establishments to spend my time and money."},{"prompt":"Given the question: You are presented with the question \\"Fish are aquatic animals that do not lack a what?\\" and the following answer choices: - the body's largest organ - furry hide - vertebral column - critical organs - thumbs - aqua lungs - salt and water. - Chlorophyll Now knowing that invertebrates are animals that lack a vertebral column, or backbone and fish are backboned aquatic animals, choose the best answer.

India (ISO: Bhārat), also known as the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh largest country by area and with more than 1.3 billion people, it is the second most populous country as well as the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi Sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British Crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947. In 2017, the Indian economy was the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing power parity.

Translate \\"Meeting on 21 November 2002,\\" to French?","completion":"La réunion du 21 novembre 2002 (This translation refers to \\"Meeting on November 21, 2002\\" in French). To provide a more detailed response, here's some background on the French language and the translation process. \\"Meeting on 21 November 2002,\\" translated to French is \\"La réunion du 21 novembre 2002.\\" Let's break down the elements of this translation for a clearer understanding of how they correspond to their English counterparts. The word \\"meeting,\\" which refers to a gathering or assembly of people for a specific purpose, is translated to \\"réunion\\" in French. In this context, \\"la réunion\\" is used, wherein \\"la\\" is the definite article corresponding to the gender of the noun \\"réunion.\\" Next, let's look at the date. In English, the format often goes by month, then day, followed by the year. In French, the typical format is day, month, and year. So, when translating \\"21 November 2002,\\" we place the day first (21), followed by the month \\"novembre\\" (which is November in French), and then the year 2002. Finally, the word \\"on\\" that precedes the date in English takes the form of \\"du\\" (a contraction of \\"de\\" and \\"le\\") in French. \\"Du\\" is used in this context to imply possession or belonging, denoting that the meeting took place on that specific date. So, \\"Meeting on 21 November 2002,\\" effectively translates to \\"La réunion du 21 novembre 2002\\" in French. Remember, when translating phrases or sentences from English to French or vice versa, it's crucial to consider syntax, grammatical rules, and proper word usage to ensure that the translation effectively conveys the intended meaning."},{"prompt":"Question: They began to copulate, someone used spit to what?

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the last name of Holst's pupil?, using the article: Holst's absorption of folksong, not only in the melodic sense but in terms of its simplicity and economy of expression, helped to develop a style that many of his contemporaries, even admirers, found austere and cerebral. This is contrary to the popular identification of Holst with The Planets, which Matthews believes has masked his status as a composer of genuine originality. Against charges of coldness in the music, Imogen cites Holst's characteristic \\"sweeping modal tunes mov[ing] reassuringly above the steps of a descending bass\\", while Michael Kennedy points to the 12 Humbert Wolfe settings of 1929, and the 12 Welsh folksong settings for unaccompanied chorus of 1930–31, as works of true warmth.Many of the characteristics that Holst employed — unconventional time signatures, rising and falling scales, ostinato, bitonality and occasional polytonality — set him apart from other English composers. Vaughan Williams remarked that Holst always said in his music what he wished to say, directly and concisely; \\"He was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded, nor did he hesitate to be remote when remoteness expressed his purpose\\". Kennedy has surmised that Holst's economy of style was in part a product of the composer's poor health: \\"the effort of writing it down compelled an artistic economy which some felt was carried too far\\". However, as an experienced instrumentalist and orchestra member, Holst understood music from the standpoint of his players and made sure that, however challenging, their parts were always practicable. According to his pupil Jane Joseph, Holst fostered in performance \\"a spirit of practical comradeship ... none could know better than he the boredom possible to a professional player, and the music that rendered boredom impossible\\"., what would be the answer ?

Article: Take note of when you can't get your mind off of the person. You might want to check their social media profiles, or get the urge to call or text them. Call yourself out, and tell yourself that you have the power to redirect your thoughts. Tell yourself, “These are obsessive thoughts,” or “I’m acting obsessively.” Say, “These thoughts don’t control me; I control them.” Sometimes, obsessive thoughts and actions can go unnoticed, or they might even feel good. Trying to pretend they don’t exist won’t do you any good. Instead, recognize them, acknowledge that you have better things to do, and remind yourself that you can manage them. Obsession, like addiction, can sometimes be a symptom of a larger need or problem in your life. Consider if there is something missing in your life that you thought this person could provide. See if there is another way you can find what you need. Write down what this person makes you feel when you are with them. Think about how you feel when they are gone. Consider what might be causing these feelings in your life. For example, you might discover that you are afraid of being lonely. If this is the case, consider joining a class or club to meet new people. Notice when and where you start to think or act obsessively. It might be difficult, especially at first, but do your best to resist obsessive urges when you face a trigger. If you can’t remove yourself from the trigger, focus on controlling your response to it. For instance, if you constantly check the person’s social media profiles or get the urge to text them, getting rid of your phone or computer isn’t practical. Instead, you could use features that remove their posts from your newsfeed or unfollow them. If you’re obsessing over your ex, give them their stuff back and try to keep things that remind you of them out of sight and out of mind. If you can’t avoid being around the person, try to keep your distance. If they sit next to you at school, try to avoid eye contact and imagine they’re someone else. Try to focus on your task at hand, like taking class notes. When you feel yourself getting fixated, take a deep breath and close your eyes. Listen carefully to the sounds around you and think about all of the other sensations you’re experiencing at that moment. Ask yourself, “What’s the temperature right now? Am I hot, cold, or comfortable? What sounds and smells am I sensing right now? What is the weather like right now? What does the sky look like?” Obsession often involves thoughts like, “What if I did this?” or “What are they doing right now?” These thoughts focus on other locations or dwell on the past or future. Concentrating on your surroundings can help you keep your thoughts in the here and now. Try imaging your mind as a floor, and your obsessive thoughts are dirt and dust covering the floor. Whenever you start to dwell, visualize yourself sweeping away all the dust and dirt with a broom. You could also imagine that the intrusive thoughts are a barking dog. Visualize yourself walking by a barking dog behind a fence. Say to yourself, “It’s just noise, and the dog can’t hurt me. In a few minutes, I’ll cross to the next block and the dog will be far behind me.” Try shaking off obsessive thoughts. When you experience them, shake your head, arms, legs, and body. Imagine that you’re shaking out the thoughts and resetting your mind. When you think about the person or get the urge to contact them, imagine a big stop sign. You could also wear a rubber band around your wrist and snap it whenever you think or act obsessively. Rituals, such as visualizing a stop sign or snapping a rubber band, are good ways to remind yourself that you need to redirect your thoughts. Do your ritual, then tell yourself, “Stop! I need to stop this thought pattern and do something to distract myself.” What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article is about how to stop obsessing over a person.

According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest \\"would be happy and unvanquishable forever\\". Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative. While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis. His successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least late Antiquity. Ptolemy IX Lathyros, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage. The recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece, at Amphipolis, dating from the time of Alexander the Great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege. Pompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all visited the tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. Caligula was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. Around AD 200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy. The so-called \\"Alexander Sarcophagus\\", discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of Abdalonymus (died 311 BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the battle of Issus in 331. However, more recently, it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymus' death.

Question: The black-and-white aerial footage shows a line of purported Taliban insurgents slowly walking along a path in a lightly forested desert in Afghanistan's western Farah province. Suddenly, the screen flashes to white as the men disappear in a fireball — the result of a bomb dropped from a U.S. MQ-9 \\"Reaper\\" drone. \\"Taliban fighters on the run following Afghan-led offensive in #Farah province, #Afghanistan. Video shows U.S. airpower (MQ-9s) in support,\\" declared a short message accompanying the video, which was posted on the official account of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Subsequent footage showed more Taliban scrambling, in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the airstrikes. The Pentagon footage was released Wednesday, as U.S., NATO and Afghan government forces were locked in a fierce battle with the Taliban for control of the capital of Farah, which borders Iran. The tweet was unusually graphic. While the U.S. military often releases footage of buildings or vehicles being destroyed, it does not as frequently distribute videos that show individuals being bombed.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sergio Santos Mendes (Portuguese pronunciation: ['seRZju 'satuZ 'medZiS]; born February 11, 1941) is a Brazilian musician. He has over 55 releases, and plays bossa nova heavily crossed with jazz and funk. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2012 as co-writer of the song \\"Real in Rio\\" from the animated film Rio. Mendes is married to Gracinha Leporace, who has performed with him since the early 1970s. Mendes' career in the U.S. stalled in the mid-1970s, but he remained very popular in South America and Japan. His two albums with Bell Records in 1973 and 1974 followed by several for Elektra from 1975 on, found Mendes continuing to mine the best in American pop music and post-Bossa writers of his native Brazil, while forging new directions in soul with collaborators like Stevie Wonder, who wrote Mendes' R&B-inflected minor hit, \\"The Real Thing.\\" In 1983, he rejoined Alpert's A&M records and enjoyed huge success with a self-titled album and several follow-up albums, all of which received considerable adult contemporary airplay with charting singles. \\"Never Gonna Let You Go\\", featuring vocals by Joe Pizzulo and Leza Miller, equalled the success of his 1968 single \\"The Look of Love\\" by reaching No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; it also spent four weeks atop the Billboard adult contemporary chart. In 1984 he recorded the Confetti album, which had the hit songs \\"Olympia\\", which was also used as a theme song for the Olympic games that year and \\"Alibis\\". The '80s also found Mendes working with singer Lani Hall again on the song \\"No Place to Hide\\" from the Brasil '86 album, and as producer of her vocals on the title song for the James Bond film Never Say Never Again. By the time Mendes released his Grammy-winning Elektra album Brasileiro in 1992, he was the undisputed master of pop-inflected Brazilian jazz. The late-1990s lounge music revival brought retrospection and respect to Mendes' oeuvre, particularly the classic Brasil '66 albums. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"Yes, an interesting aspect from the article is: \\"By the time Mendes released his Grammy-winning Elektra album Brasileiro in 1992, he was the undisputed master of pop-inflected Brazilian jazz.\\" This quote highlights Mendes' success and his significant impact on the Brazilian jazz genre over the years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What is the origin of icebergs?\\" Context: \\"Tidewater glaciers are glaciers that terminate in the sea, including most glaciers flowing from Greenland, Antarctica, Baffin and Ellesmere Islands in Canada, Southeast Alaska, and the Northern and Southern Patagonian Ice Fields. As the ice reaches the sea, pieces break off, or calve, forming icebergs. Most tidewater glaciers calve above sea level, which often results in a tremendous impact as the iceberg strikes the water. Tidewater glaciers undergo centuries-long cycles of advance and retreat that are much less affected by the climate change than those of other glaciers.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The origin of icebergs can be traced back to the process of calving that occurs in tidewater glaciers. Tidewater glaciers are a type of glaciers that flow and terminate in the sea, and they are predominantly found in regions such as Greenland, Antarctica, Baffin and Ellesmere Islands in Canada, Southeast Alaska, and the Northern and Southern Patagonian Ice Fields. As these glaciers reach the ocean, chunks of ice break off or calve, leading to the formation of icebergs. The majority of tidewater glacier calving takes place above sea level, resulting in a powerful impact when the iceberg plunges into the water. This calving process is a natural part of the tidewater glacier's life cycle, involving periods of advance and retreat that span centuries. It is important to note that the advance and retreat cycles of tidewater glaciers are less influenced by climate change compared to other types of glaciers. The formation of icebergs from tidewater glaciers occurs as a result of the glacier's natural movement and interaction with the sea, making it a continuous process that contributes to the presence of icebergs in the world's oceans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Nelson had an extensive collection of pajamas that he loved to wear every night. His wardrobe included everything from flannel sets in the winter to lightweight silk pajamas during the warmer months.

Q:Process: - Acid rain is produced by chemicals that reach into the atmosphere - Falls onto the ground - The acid rain starts scouring rocks - Destroys vegetation - The lack of vegetation alters the surrounding environment. suppose less conservation occurs happens, how will it affect more altering of surrounding environment occurs. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in the case of less conservation leading to more alteration of the surrounding environment, due to the process of acid rain production, is indirectly impacting a step of the process. To understand this better, let's break down the process of acid rain production and its subsequent environmental impacts: 1. Acid rain is produced by chemicals (sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) emitted by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, which reach into the atmosphere. 2. These chemicals react with water vapor and other elements in the atmosphere to form acidic compounds. 3. Acid rain falls onto the ground and affects the environment in various ways, including scouring rocks and soil, and causing the release of harmful substances, like aluminum, into water systems. 4. Acid rain destroys vegetation by damaging the leaves and depriving plants of nutrients. 5. The lack of vegetation alters the surrounding environment, leading to soil erosion, water contamination, and the disruption of ecosystems. Now, let's consider the role of conservation in this process. Conservation efforts may include policies and practices aimed at reducing air pollution, promoting the use of cleaner energy sources, preserving natural habitats, and educating the public about the harmful effects of acid rain. For example, the implementation of stricter emission standards for vehicles and power plants can help reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides released into the atmosphere, thereby mitigating the formation of acid rain. If less conservation occurs, it would mean that there is less effort in reducing the release of harmful chemicals and preserving the environment. Consequently, the concentration of acid-producing pollutants in the atmosphere will increase, resulting in more frequent and severe acid rain events. This exacerbates the environmental impacts such as damage to vegetation and rocks, water contamination, and ecosystem disruption. Therefore, the perturbation in question - less conservation leading to more alteration of the surrounding environment due to the acid rain process - can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. The decrease in conservation efforts doesn't directly affect a single step in the acid rain formation and its subsequent impacts; rather, it indirectly amplifies the severity of the entire process by allowing increased emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which in turn contribute to more significant environmental damage in various forms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An anemometer is a tool for measuring wind speed. You can buy one online, or make a simple one yourself in about 30 minutes using the steps below. If you bought one, skip down to the step in which you count the rotations – or just read the wind speed directly, if yours has a digital display. Take four small paper cups, and punch a single hole in each one, about ½ inch (1.25 cm) below the rim. Take a fifth cup, and puncture four evenly spaced holes, about ¼ in. (6 mm) below the rim, then punch a fifth hole in the center of its base. You can use a pencil to punch these holes, if you don't have anything sharper. Stick a plastic straw into a single-hole cup, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) into it. Push the other end of the straw through two holes of the five-hole cup. Stick the free end of the straw into another single-hole cup. Turn the two single-hole cups so they are pointing in opposite directions, along the same plane as the straw. Staple the straw to the cup. Repeat with another straw, putting it through the remaining two holes of the central five-hole cup. Rotate these two new cups until each cup opening is nearer the base of the next one. In other words, the top cup points right, the right cup points down, the bottom cup points left, and the left cup points up. Staple the straws and cups together. Slide the two straws until all four cups are the same distance from the center. Stick a small pin through the intersection of the two straws. Stick the eraser end of a pencil through the hole in the base of the central cup, and push it gently onto the pin. You can now hold the anemometer by the pencil tip, and use it to measure wind speeds. Hold the anemometer upright in a windy area. Watch a single cup (draw on it with a marker if it makes it easier to follow) and count the number of times it rotates. Use a stopwatch or a friend watching the second hand of a clock to time 15 seconds, and stop you when the time is up. Multiply your count by four to get the number of revolutions per minute (rpm). For greater accuracy, count the number of rotations in 60 seconds (and don't multiply by anything). Measure the distance from one edge of the anemometer to the other to find the diameter of the rotating circle, d. The circumference of the circle, is equal to πd. This is the distance traveled in one revolution. If you don't have a calculator, you can use 3.14 as an estimate of π, or even just 3 for a rough estimate. Convert the circumference you calculated into a more useful unit for measuring wind speed (miles or kilometers). Multiply the result by the rpm you calculated to get the total distance traveled in one minute. Multiply the result by 60 to get the distance traveled in one hour (mph or km/h). Here are the full formulas in imperial and metric units: Imperial: (__circumference__ inches/revolution) * (1/12 ft/inches) * (1/5280 miles/ft) * (__rpm__ revolutions/minute) * (60 minutes/hour) = __wind speed__ in miles per hour. Metric: (__circumference__ centimeters/revolution) * (1/100000 kilometers/centimeter) * (__rpm__ revolutions/minute) * (60 minutes/hour) = __wind speed__ in kilometers per hour.

Write an article based on this \\"Eat more foods high in omega-3s. Try intermittent fasting. Incorporate curcumin into your diet. Increase your intake of blueberries. Use supplements. Avoid foods high in sugar and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS).\\"","completion":"Title: Boost Your Health: The Benefits of Omega-3s, Intermittent Fasting, Curcumin, Blueberries, Supplements, and Avoiding Sugary Foods Introduction Our modern world has been inundated with overly processed, unhealthy food options that can lead to various health issues. However, it is important to make conscious choices for a healthier lifestyle. One way to achieve this balance is by incorporating nutrient-dense foods and mindful eating habits. In this article, we will explore the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, intermittent fasting, curcumin, blueberries, supplementation, and the importance of avoiding foods high in sugar and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). The Power of Omega-3s Omega-3 fatty acids play an important role in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. These essential nutrients are vital for heart health, brain function, and reducing inflammation. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines, as well as in plant-based sources such as flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts. Studies suggest that consuming omega-3s can improve symptoms of depression, reduce ADHD symptoms in children, and help prevent heart disease. Moreover, these fatty acids may also support healthy joints, immune function, and communication between cells. To reap these benefits, it is suggested to consume at least two servings of fatty fish per week or to opt for a high-quality omega-3 supplement. Intermittent Fasting: A Fresh Approach to Eating Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of eating and fasting. Instead of focusing on what food we should consume, it emphasizes the timing of meals. Popular methods include the 16/8 method, the 5:2 diet, and Eat-Stop-Eat. Research has shown that intermittent fasting can lead to numerous benefits such as weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, reduced inflammation, and enhanced brain function. Moreover, it can improve your body's ability to repair cells and may even extend your lifespan. However, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any fasting regime, especially if you have any underlying health conditions. Curcumin: A Potent Antioxidant Curcumin is the active compound found in turmeric, which is responsible for its bright yellow color and numerous health benefits. It has been used in traditional medicine for centuries and is known for its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Regular consumption of curcumin has been linked to reduced symptoms of arthritis, a decreased risk of heart disease, and improved brain health. To incorporate it into your daily routine, you can add turmeric to your meals, opt for a high-quality curcumin supplement, or consume golden milk (turmeric tea) regularly. Boost Your Health with Blueberries Blueberries are loaded with powerful antioxidants, which help neutralize free radicals and protect your cells from damage. They are an excellent source of vitamins, fiber, and antioxidants, mainly anthocyanins, which give blueberries their vibrant color. Studies have revealed that blueberries can improve brain function, support heart health, and may even help prevent cancer. Add a handful of blueberries to your breakfast, snack on them throughout the day, or incorporate them into your favorite smoothie recipe to enjoy their numerous health benefits. Maximize Your Nutrient Intake with Supplements It can be challenging to meet all of your nutrient needs through food alone. High-quality supplements can help fill the gaps and ensure you are getting essential vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. For example, a multivitamin can provide essential nutrients like vitamin D, vitamin B12, and magnesium. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine your specific nutrient requirements and to choose the appropriate supplements. Avoid Sugar and High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) High consumption of added sugars and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has been linked to numerous health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Additionally, these sweeteners can contribute to chronic inflammation, damage your gut, and accelerate the aging process. To reduce your added sugar intake, read food labels carefully, opt for natural sweeteners like honey or stevia, and limit your consumption of processed foods and beverages high in sugar. Conclusion To promote and maintain optimal health, it is crucial to incorporate nutrient-dense foods and mindful eating habits into your daily routine. By focusing on omega-3s, intermittent fasting, curcumin, blueberries, supplements, and avoiding sugary foods, you'll be well-equipped to nourish your body and support your well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose thoughts on what inspired him to such an individual mode of expression art historians have struggled with? from the following article ? Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\".

We live along coastlines, around bays, up the course of rivers and streams and on islands. We also vacation at the beach and find comfort fishing on a lake. Nothing makes small children happier than the chance of playing in water. More surprisingly, this human favor for water makes evolutionary sense. Sure, we need drinking water to live, but we have also benefited from what's swimming under the waves. Neuroscientist Crawford of the University of North London has proposed that our ancient ancestors attached to the sea, and that their devotion paid off by allowing the human species to develop large and complex brains. Crawford claims that when humans separated from apes and appeared in the forests of Africa, they stuck close to rivers and beaches and started catching fish, clams and crabs. That seafood was packed with omega-3 fatty acids, essential fatty acids that promote brain cell growth. It's no coincidence, Crawford claims, that human brain growth began to increase rapidly once we left the woods and headed for the beach. Scientists have also discovered that people who eat fish regularly are less likely to suffer from depression than those who eat less seafood. Biochemist Hibbelin of the National Institutes of Health has shown that across cultures there is a direct link between amount of fish eaten each week and rates of depression. More interestingly, Hibbelin and researcher Laura have found that fish is commonly used as a symbol of happiness and good health in various religions and cultures. We know that fish and the sea are good for us, and so we seek them out. We vacation on the coast and see the waves come and go, feeling happiness has taken over our brain. When we move inland, or go home from vacation, we lose touch with our sea roots and feel unhappy. A:","completion":"Which statement best explains the human favor for living near water and its connection to our evolution? a) People's preference for water is purely based on aesthetic reasons. b) Living near water allowed our ancestors to develop larger and complex brains due to the consumption of seafood rich in omega-3 fatty acids. c) The majority of human populations settled near water sources only for easy access to drinking water. d) There is no evolutionary connection between human populations living near water and their overall well-being.

Q:An old man was going home late one night with his horse and cart after a day's hard work. When he was not far from his house, the light on the cart went out. He tried but could not mend it. He was near his home, and so he went along the road without a light. When a policeman saw this, he stopped the old carter. \\"Where is your light?\\" asked the policeman. \\"No man may take a cart along the road at night without a light. You know that. You have broken the law .\\" \\"I had a light, but it has just gone out,\\" said the old man. \\"I don't believe that story,\\" said the policeman. He took out a book and got ready to write. What's your name and where do you live?\\" he asked. \\"Please don't take my name,\\" said the old man. \\"My home is just there. You can see it from here. I had a light nearly the whole way. I haven't come far without a light.\\" \\"You came all the way without a light. What's your name?\\" The carter quickly took the policeman's hand and put it down on top of the light. The light was still hot and burnt the policeman's hand. The policeman jumped and he was very angry. \\"Now, what do you think?\\" said the carter. \\"Did I come all the way without a light?\\" What made the policeman believe the old man's words? A) He made the policeman touch the light. B) He jumped and shouted angrily. C) He made the policeman angry. D) The light burnt the policeman's hands. A:","completion":"The correct answer is A) He made the policeman touch the light. This is because, when the policeman touched the hot light, he could infer that the lamp had been working recently because it was still hot. Had the light been out for a longer duration, it would have lost its heat. Therefore, touching the light gave the policeman physical evidence to believe the old man's claim that he had a light for the majority of his journey. It wasn't merely reliance on the old man's words, but the tactile confirmation that convinced the policeman. Hence, while B), C), and D) may have occurred, they were not the reasons why the policeman believed the old man's words.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: A Times Intern Connects With a Muslim Family in Staten Island Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. In this article, Samantha Schmidt, an intern with the metro section, reflects on what her brief immersion in the life of one Staten Island family taught her about the challenges of being a Muslim parent in America. The metro editors huddled around their desks for a morning news meeting in early August when Michael Luo suggested an idea. He had read a recent first-person essay in the Sunday Review about a father’s experience raising American Muslim children in the age of Donald J. Trump. He wondered if a metro reporter could delve into this topic as well. It was always a bit intimidating for me — a 22-year-old intern fresh out of college — to speak up in editors’ meetings. But I had been itching for a heftier story and have always had an interest in reporting about Muslim communities, so I volunteered to look into it. We had a very specific type of family in mind: Muslim parents with children, born in the United States, between the ages of 6 and 12 who attend public school. Finding a family that filled the bill was hard enough. Persuading a family to give me the access I needed to their home, their children and their daily life would be its own obstacle. Moreover, I was skeptical about being able to get children as young as 7 years old to talk about an issue as complicated as the presidential election. Over the course of two months, whenever I wasn’t reporting on daily news, I worked toward finding the family I envisioned. I decided to focus on Staten Island, because of its reputation as a Republican stronghold and as New York City’s whitest borough. It seemed to me that a Muslim growing up in Staten Island would be exposed to more of Mr. Trump’s rhetoric than one in Brooklyn or Queens. I made countless phone calls to Staten Island imams, police liaisons and community leaders. I visited a Staten Island mosque for two separate Friday prayer services, speaking with parents and asking if they could refer me to other families. It was proving difficult to find Muslim children who attended Staten Island public schools, because, as parents told me, so many Muslim families had decided to move their children to private Islamic schools in recent years. After reaching out to nearly a dozen Muslim families, I was introduced to the Elcharfas. When I first spoke with the mother, Nayla Elhamoui, over the phone, I explained to her the type of story I hoped to pursue. I wanted to get inside the minds of her children, to understand the conversations she and her husband, Bilal Elcharfa, had with them, and to learn about the ways in which the election was affecting them personally. Ms. Elhamoui talked about the time her 9-year-old daughter’s classmates told her Donald Trump wanted to kick her family out of the country. Hearing the mother’s fears and frustrations, I knew immediately that the Elcharfas were the perfect fit for this profile. But I could not have predicted the extent to which I would see these fears play out in their daily lives over the next few weeks. After only a brief phone call, she insisted I visit her home the following day. I spent the bulk of two days with the family, sitting with them as they shared meals, following the youngsters as they played in their neighborhood and even riding in Mr. Elcharfa’s taxi as he drove to work in Manhattan. They couldn’t have been more welcoming. When Christian Hansen, the photographer on the story, arrived at the family’s home at 6:30 a.m., having never met Mr. Elcharfa (who answered the door), the photographer said, “Hello, I’m Christian.” The father responded, with a smile, “Hi, I’m Muslim.” I am still shocked at how open and comfortable they seemed with us in their home. I wonder if my experience reporting on — and living within — Muslim communities helped me connect with them. After three years of studying Arabic in college, I spent the fall semester of my senior year studying the language in Amman, Jordan. I lived with a Muslim host family, reported on Syrian refugee camps and learned a great deal about Islam. Although all of my interviews with the Elcharfa family were in English, the parents frequently talked to each other, and their children, in Arabic. They would occasionally forget a word in English and use the Arabic word instead. I felt that my ability to — mostly — understand them, and their faith, was integral to gaining their trust and noticing crucial details over the course of my reporting. The more time I spent in the family’s home, the more I was able to observe the rawest of moments, such as the time the parents began arguing in the kitchen over whether 9-year-old Zaynub should begin wearing a hijab. It was a fascinating and incredibly revealing conversation that I’m sure many Muslim parents have had, especially in the U.S. I went into this story hoping to learn about how Muslim parents help their children grapple with the rhetoric in today’s election. I came out of it learning so much more about the challenges of being a Muslim parent in this country — of striking a balance between encouraging children to connect to their faith and allowing them to pave their own way. Finding this balance becomes even more difficult when kids’ peers — or what they see on the news — pressure them to turn away from their religion entirely. My article was published online on Tuesday, a few days after my internship at The Times came to an end. Since then, a number of Muslim parents have reached out to me expressing similar fears and dilemmas, and thanking me for illustrating these experiences for readers. But the most meaningful note came from Mr. Elcharfa: “Thank you so much for being our voice.”","completion":"A reporter wanted to write a story about a Muslim family living in New York. She looked for a family with children who were born in the United States and went to public school. The reporter had a hard time finding a family like this until she met the Elcharfa family. The reporter spent time with this family to learn about how they talked about the election and dealt with challenges of being Muslim in America. After her story was published, other Muslim parents reached out to her, and the Elcharfa family thanked her for being their voice."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\". - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana. - Public relations (PR) is the practice of managing the spread of information between an individual or an organization (such as a business, government agency, or a nonprofit organization) and the public. Public relations may include an organization or individual gaining exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment. This differentiates it from advertising as a form of marketing communications. Public relations is the idea of creating coverage for clients for free, rather than marketing or advertising. An example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a client, rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article. The aim of public relations is to inform the public, prospective customers, investors, partners, employees, and other stakeholders and ultimately persuade them to maintain a certain view about the organization, its leadership, products, or political decisions. Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms, businesses and companies, government, government agencies and public officials as PIOs and nongovernmental organizations, and nonprofit organizations. Jobs central to public relations include account coordinator, account executive, account supervisor, and media relations manager. - The Old Media or Legacy Media are traditional means of communication and expression that have existed since before the advent of the new medium of the Internet.

Normally, when this occurs, an effort is made on the part of authorities to recapture them and return them to their original detainers. Escaping from prison is also a criminal offense in some countries, such as the United States and Russia, and it is highly likely to result in time being added to the inmate's sentence, as well as the inmate being placed under increased security. Aggravating factors include whether or not violence was used. Is the following statement correct based on the text is it illegal to break out of prison","completion":"Yes, the statement is correct based on the provided text. Escaping from prison is considered a criminal offense in some countries, such as the United States and Russia. When an inmate leaves prison through unofficial or illegal ways, it is referred to as a prison escape or prison break. Authorities make efforts to recapture escaped inmates and return them to their original detainers (the prison from which they escaped). In addition to being a criminal offense, prison escapes can also result in several consequences for the inmate. These consequences may include an extended sentence, meaning more time will be added to their original prison term. Furthermore, the inmate may be placed under increased security when they are returned to prison, in order to reduce the risk of future escape attempts. Aggravating factors can also come into play when considering the severity of a prison escape incident. Such factors might include the use of violence during the escape, which can result in additional charges and a longer sentence for the escaped inmate. In essence, breaking out of prison is not only illegal, but it also carries consequences that can significantly impact the inmate's life and the duration of their time behind bars."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In pictures: Alexa Chung's greatest fashion hits The model turned TV presenter and fashion designer has all the attributes required to pull off the look with aplomb: Bambi-esque limbs, doe eyes and ability to make girls swoon with envy at her wardrobe without looking like she's made any effort at all. For the October issue of Harper's Bazaar, Alexa has gone back in time, modelling a range of new season designs in the Sixties style in and around David Hockney's Notting Hill flat, and talking about how her love affair with the decade began. \\"My ex-boyfriend [photographer David Titlow] showed me Antonioni's 1966 film Blow-Up in my late teens.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the last names of the two people who are thought to be rustlers by the bar patrons? from the following article ? In Bridger's Wells, Nevada in 1885, Art Croft and Gil Carter ride into town and enter Darby's Saloon. The atmosphere is subdued due to recent incidents of cattle-rustling. Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town. A man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \\"Major\\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass. The posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson. Later that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Martínez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke (Francis Ford, brother of film director John Ford). Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decides to hang the three men at sunrise. Martin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, shows it to the others.

The US team studied East Antarctica, while the Swiss team studied West Antarctica. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which team didn't learn about a region that doesn't show signs of appreciable melting despite the large amount of surface warming? Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Doniger hesitated for a moment, his heart pounding in his chest, and saw no other option but to climb onto the cart. He reached out with trembling hands and, grabbing onto the wooden frame, hauled himself up onto it. The monks, now several feet ahead, seemed not to notice him or the noise his ragged breaths made. They continued moving in perfect unison, as though a single unit, making Doniger feel small and inconsequential. As Doniger crouched amongst the bundles of cloth, he noticed that the monks were making their way toward the village's main temple - a large, imposing building made of stone, its turrets crowned with ornate carvings of ancient deities. Doniger instinctively wanted to hide and not draw attention to his presence, but something about the monks' procession seemed to call out to him. His curiosity was piqued, and he knew in his heart that hiding was not the answer. Instead, he decided to follow them and try to unravel the mystery of the monks' existence. As the cart trundled behind a procession of monks, people started to gather at the sides of the dusty road. They too had taken notice of the monks, their eyes filled with a mix of awe and fear. Whispers began to spread and Doniger couldn't help but pick up on some of the murmurs. \\"It's been decades since the monks set foot in our village,\\" one villager muttered. \\"They must be here on a holy mission,\\" another whispered, her hands clasped together in prayer. As the temple loomed closer, Doniger could see the wooden doors creaking open to reveal its inner sanctum. Torches flickered in the shadowy corridors, casting eerie, dancing lights on the stone walls and floor. The monks halted, and the cart came to a stop just outside the temple doors. Doniger hopped off the cart, hesitating for only a moment, and then followed the monks inside. Within the temple, the air was heavy, as though charged with unseen energy. The monks bowed in unison before the main altar, where an ancient, multi-armed deity loomed over them, its stone face inscrutable. The head monk stepped forward, raising his hands above his head, and began to speak in a language Doniger didn't understand. His voice echoed through the temple, and in response, something seemed to shift in the air around them - the atmosphere grew even heavier, and Doniger felt a chill race down his spine. As the ceremony progressed, the monks' voices rose and fell in a beautiful, haunting chant, their words weaving a spell that seemed to sway the souls of those who listened. Doniger, now at the edge of the gathered crowd, felt as if he were teetering between understanding and confusion. When the ceremony reached its crescendo, the monks stopped chanting, their bodies tensing in unison, and the echo of their voices spiraled upward, soaring high towards the towering temple ceiling. For a moment, the room was utterly still. Then, slowly, a deep thrumming sound filled the temple, as if the very earth beneath them were resonating in response to the monks' ritual. Doniger couldn't help but be in awe of what he had witnessed. He knew that he had just seen something sacred, something that few people in his village would ever experience. As the monks began to disperse, he couldn't help but wonder about the true purpose of their visit, and if their presence would somehow change the course of his village's destiny. And, as he left the temple, Doniger felt a new determination within him. He decided he would seek out the wisdom of the monks and learn about their ancient traditions, hoping to find answers to not only the mystery of their visit, but perhaps for his own unrest within. And perhaps, in the process, he would find his place within this impermanent world and, ultimately, his own purpose in the vast, interconnected web of existence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In dieser ausführlichen Antwort möchte ich zunächst einmal die Türkei allgemein beschreiben, bevor ich auf die Originalfrage eingehe, die sich auf das Land bezieht. Die Türkei ist ein eurasisches Land, das geografisch sowohl in Europa als auch in Asien liegt. Der größte Teil des Landes, ungefähr 97%, befindet sich in der Region Anatolien in Westasien, während der Rest in Südosteuropa ist und sich über die Region Ostthrakien erstreckt. Die Türkei grenzt an acht Länder: Bulgarien im Nordwesten, Griechenland im Westen, Georgien im Nordosten, Armenien, Aserbaidschan, und den Iran im Osten, sowie den Irak und Syrien im Süden. Die Hauptstadt der Türkei ist Ankara, während Istanbul, das früher Byzanz und dann Konstantinopel hieß, die bevölkerungsreichste Stadt und das kulturelle Zentrum ist. Die offizielle Sprache ist Türkisch, und die Bevölkerung besteht hauptsächlich aus ethnischen Türken und einer beträchtlichen kurdischen Minderheit. Die Türkei verfügt über beeindruckende kulturelle und historische Stätten, die aufgrund ihrer langen Geschichte und ihrer Bedeutung als Brücke zwischen Europa, Asien und dem Nahen Osten eine Vielzahl von Einflüssen in sich tragen. Zu diesen historischen Stätten und kulturellen Reichtümern gehören die antiken Ruinen von Ephesus, die Kalkterrassen von Pamukkale, die unterirdischen Städte Kappadokiens, die byzantinische Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, und viele andere. Das türkische politische System ist eine parlamentarische Demokratie, und das Land verfügt über eine gut entwickelte Wirtschaft, die sowohl auf Handel und Industrie als auch auf Landwirtschaft und Tourismus basiert. In den letzten Jahren gab es jedoch einige interne politische Herausforderungen, einschließlich innenpolitischer Spannungen und Meinungsverschiedenheiten zwischen verschiedenen politischen Gruppen sowie der Verwaltung von Flüchtlingen, die vor allem aus Syrien geflohen sind.

Answer: A Permanent Resident holds many of the same rights and responsibilities as a Canadian citizen, among others the right to work for any enterprise as well as for the federal or provincial government (under restriction of access rights to certain regulated professions). Question: what is a landed immigrant in canada A:","completion":"A landed immigrant in Canada refers to an individual who has been granted the status of a permanent resident but is not yet a citizen. A permanent resident is someone who has been granted the permission to live and work in Canada indefinitely while still being a citizen of another country. This term has largely been replaced by the term \\"permanent resident,\\" but some people still use \\"landed immigrant\\" to describe the same status. As a landed immigrant or permanent resident, a person is entitled to many of the same rights, privileges, and responsibilities as Canadian citizens, with some exceptions. Here are the key aspects of being a landed immigrant in Canada: 1. Right to work: Landed immigrants have the right to work for any employer in Canada, both in the private and public sectors. They can also work for federal or provincial governments, albeit with some access restrictions to certain regulated professions. 2. Right to healthcare: Landed immigrants are eligible for government-funded healthcare benefits, similar to those enjoyed by Canadian citizens. 3. Social benefits: Landed immigrants have access to the same social benefits as Canadian citizens, such as Child Tax Benefits, Old Age Security, and Guaranteed Income Supplement. 4. Legal rights: Landed immigrants in Canada have the same legal rights as Canadian citizens, including the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, the right to a fair trial, and the right to be protected against unreasonable searches and seizures. 5. Education: Landed immigrants have access to publicly funded education systems, from kindergarten to post-secondary institutions, at subsidized or local rates, without any restrictions. 6. Mobility: Landed immigrants can freely move within Canada, work, and reside in any Canadian province or territory. They can also leave and re-enter the country without any restrictions, as long as they maintain their permanent resident status. However, there are certain differences between landed immigrants and Canadian citizens: 1. Voting: Landed immigrants do not have the right to vote in federal, provincial, or municipal elections in Canada. They must first become Canadian citizens to gain voting rights. 2. Running for political office: Landed immigrants are not eligible to run for elected office in federal, provincial, or municipal governments in Canada. 3. Holding certain government positions: Landed immigrants cannot hold high-level government positions that require Canadian citizenship or security clearances, such as jobs in national security or intelligence agencies. 4. Citizenship: Landed immigrants are not Canadian citizens and cannot apply for or hold a Canadian passport. However, they can apply for Canadian citizenship after meeting specific residency requirements and other criteria. In summary, a landed immigrant in Canada refers to a person who has been granted permanent residency status, allowing them to live, work, and enjoy many benefits similar to Canadian citizens while still being a citizen of another country. This term is largely interchangeable with \\"permanent resident,\\" and individuals with this status have several rights and responsibilities in Canada but may not vote, run for elected office, or hold certain high-level government positions until they become Canadian citizens."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His horse, a magnificent and well-groomed chestnut mare, prances in place, well-trained and accustomed to the excitement of the chase. The gathered onlookers, made up of both townsfolk and travelers alike, erupt in a cacophony of applause and whistles.

Which city will need to inspect their dams more often? The city of Reslie is known for its grilled cheese sandwiches. People come from all over the world to taste their sandwiches. The mayor of Reslie, while having a meeting about how to spend the excess funds from tourism this year, was told that the city is experiencing soil piping. The neighboring city, Tichago, consumes many of Reslie's grilled cheese sandwiches. The mayor of Tichago has just received a phone call from the mayor of Reslie asking if Tichago is also having soil piping. Tichago's mayor replies that no, they are not. Hint: Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage. Answer:","completion":"The city that will need to inspect their dams more often is Reslie. This is because Reslie is experiencing soil piping, which is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface and can cause levee and dam failure. Since Tichago's mayor confirmed that they are not facing soil piping issues, Reslie is the city that needs to be more cautious and inspect their dams more frequently to avoid potential issues caused by soil piping."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a title for this article: When Mad Men ends its 7-season run on Sunday night, it may go down in history as the show that had the the biggest influence but the smallest audience. It’s incredibly rare for Mad Men to attract more than 3 million viewers at a time. The premier of the second half of the 7th season drew 2 million viewers, according to Horizon Media. To put that in perspective, a successful show, like Scandal, on a broadcast network can regularly attract 8 million or more viewers. Despite its tiny audience, Mad Men has had a huge influence on the culture and on television. It was the first high-quality cable show and it set the stage for high-quality but (potentially) low-rated shows on Netflix Netflix. Before Mad Men hit AMC in 2007, there were broadcast network shows and there was HBO. Network shows were big and popular, HBO shows were prestigious and award winning. PBS was somewhere in the middle (closer to HBO) and basic cable was closer to broadcast but it wasn’t the place people went to see really good shows. Don Draper has more buzz than viewers. Mad Men changed that equation. Before Mad Men, AMC was the American Movie Channel and showed mostly old movies. When the channel decided to move into original content it was taking a risk. Networks like FX had successfully programmed original shows like The Shield and Nip/Tuck. But to set itself apart, AMC decided to bank on a character-driven period piece that didn’t seem like a clear-cut hit. From creator Matthew Weiner, who had previously worked on The Sopranos, Mad Men was immediately a huge hit … with critics. The show attracted a tiny, but influential, audience. Critics loved it and the show inspired a million think pieces on feminism, masculinity and identity. The fashions on the ’60s-set show appeared in magazines and on runways and star Jon Hamm became an icon. It almost didn’t matter that not that many people watched. The show established AMC as the home of daring, quality television. Subsequent shows like Breaking Bad built on Mad Men‘s success and when The Walking Dead came along in 2010, AMC cemented its reputation as the basic-cable equivalent of HBO. Mad Men‘s low ratings but intense buzz paved the way for the original shows that are now sending Netflix’s stock price to new highs. Netflix did something very smart that in retrospect, HBO should have done — it refused to release viewer numbers. Without advertising, there’s really no need to tell the world how many people watch each show so Netflix hasn’t done it. We know that shows like House of Cards and Orange Orange is the New Black are popular not because of any Nielsen numbers but because of the amount of chatter about the shows in the media and on social networks. But while some have questioned AMC’s lack of viewers for a show like Mad Men, no one questions Netflix’s lack of viewers because no one can.

Sometimes you'll hear people say that you can't expect someone else to love you until you love yourself. Either way, you've got to love yourself first and this can be tricky. Sure we all know that we're the apple of our parent's eyes, and that our Grandmas think we're great talents and our Uncle Roberts think that we will go to the Olympics. But sometimes it's a lot harder to think such nice thoughts about ourselves. If you find that believing in yourself is a challenge. It is time you built a positive self-image and learn to love yourself. Self-image is your own mind's picture of yourself. This image includes the way you look, the way you act, the way you talk and the way you think. Interestingly, our self-images are often quite different from the images others hold about us. Unfortunately, most of these images are more negative than they should be. Thus changing the way you think about yourself is the key to changing your self-image and your whole world. The best way to defeat a passive self-image is to step back and decide to stress your successes. That is, make a list of you need to, but write down all of the great things you do every day. Don't allow doubts to occur in it. It very well might be that you are experiencing a negative self-image because you can't move past one flaw or weakness that you see about yourself. Well, roll up your sleeves and make a change of it as your primary task. If you think you're silly because you aren't good at math, find a tutor. If you think you're weak because you can't run a mile, get to the track and practice. If you think you're dull because you think it doesn't mean it's true. The best way to get rid of a negative self-image is to realize that your image is far from objective, and to actively convince yourself of your positive qualities.

Vice President Cheney called Crown Prince Abdullah on July 5, 2001, to seek Saudi help in preventing threatened attacks on American facilities in the Kingdom. Secretary of State Powell met with the crown prince twice before 9/11. They discussed topics like Iraq, not al Qaeda.U.S.-Saudi relations in the summer of 2001 were marked by sometimes heated disagreements about ongoing Israeli- Palestinian violence, not about Bin Laden. The confirmation of the Pentagon's new leadership was a lengthy process. Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz was confirmed in March 2001 and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith in July. Though the new officials were briefed about terrorism and some of the earlier planning, including that for Operation Infinite Resolve, they were focused, as Secretary Rumsfeld told us, on creating a twenty-first-century military. At the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton did not recall much interest by the new administration in military options against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He could not recall any specific guidance on the topic from the secretary. Brian Sheridan-the outgoing assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict (SOLIC), the key counterterrorism policy office in the Pentagon-never briefed Rumsfeld. He departed on January 20; he had not been replaced by 9/11. Rumsfeld noted to us his own interest in terrorism, which came up often in his regular meetings with Tenet. He thought that the Defense Department, before 9/11, was not organized adequately or prepared to deal with new threats like terrorism. But his time was consumed with getting new officials in place and working on the foundation documents of a new defense policy, the quadrennial defense review, the defense planning guidance, and the existing contingency plans. He did not recall any particular counterterrorism issue that engaged his attention before 9/11, other than the development of the Predator unmanned aircraft system. The commander of Central Command, General Franks, told us that he did not regard the existing plans as serious. To him a real military plan to address al Qaeda would need to go all the way, following through the details of a full campaign (including the political-military issues of where operations would be based) and securing the rights to fly over neighboring countries. The draft presidential directive circulated in June 2001 began its discussion of the military by reiterating the Defense Department's lead role in protecting its forces abroad. Question: \\"What is the last name of the general whose military plan included full campaign and securing the rights to fly over neighboring countries following 9/11?\\" Answer: \\"Rumsfeld\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Options are: (i) no.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Goal: how do you squash something? Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"To squash something refers to compressing or flattening an object. Depending on the type of object, material, and desired outcome, squashing can be achieved through various methods. Here, we'll discuss some of the most common and reasonable methods to accomplish this goal: 1. Manual Compression: For soft or flexible materials such as clay, dough, or certain fruits and vegetables, manually applying pressure with your hands or a tool (such as a potato masher) is often enough to achieve the desired squashed or flattened effect. Gradually increasing pressure, evenly distributing force, and choosing the appropriate tool will yield the best results. 2. Mechanical Compression: For objects that are more resistant to force, using a mechanical device like a press or a vise can apply tremendous controlled pressure to squash the object evenly or conform to a specific shape. Examples include using a hydraulic press to flatten metal objects or shaping clay or metal using a rolling mill or extruding machine. 3. Pounding or Hammering: For certain materials, such as meat or some types of metal or stone, applying force through pounding or hammering can result in the desired squash effect. For example, using a meat tenderizer or a mallet on a piece of meat or a chisel on stone can effectively squash the material into the desired shape or flatness. Just remember that the force must be evenly distributed and controlled to avoid damaging or breaking the object. 4. Heat or Chemical Exposure: In certain instances, squash-ability can be induced or increased through the application of heat or chemicals. For instance, some plastics become flexible when exposed to heat and can be squashed more easily, while metals may become malleable when heated to a specific temperature. In some cases, chemical reactions can change an object's structure, making it easier to squash it or causing it to collapse. However, heat and chemicals should be used cautiously, following safety guidelines, and with a clear understanding of the material properties to avoid adverse effects. 5. Vacuum or Pneumatic Compression: In certain industrial applications, objects can be squashed or compressed by creating a pressure differential. This can be achieved by using vacuum or pneumatic technology to exert atmospheric or air pressure on the object. An example of this would be vacuum pressing used in woodworking, which squashes wood veneer against a substrate using atmospheric pressure distributed evenly via a vacuum bag. Taking into consideration the properties and constraints of the object you wish to squash, as well as your intended outcome and available resources, will help you determine the most reasonable method to accomplish your goal. It is essential to carefully consider the potential hazards and safety concerns associated with each method in order to achieve successful results while avoiding injuries or damage to the object or surrounding environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For more specific discussions of poetry and theater, see Poetry of the United States and Theater in the United States. During its early history, America was a series of British colonies on the eastern coast of the present-day United States. Therefore, its literary tradition begins as linked to the broader tradition of English literature. However, unique American characteristics and the breadth of its production usually now cause it to be considered a separate path and tradition. - A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life. It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (résumé), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality. - Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short story writer, and journalist. His economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. Additional works, including three novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works, were published posthumously.

While memoir has historically been defined as a subcategory of biography or autobiography since the late 20th century, the genre is differentiated in form, presenting a narrowed focus. A biography or autobiography tells the story \\"of a life\\", while a memoir often tells \\"a story from a life\\", such as touchstone events and turning points from the author's life.

I was trying to scream over the crowd. \\"It almost felt like half England on one side and India on the other. I don't think that atmosphere will be replicated in a number of years.\\" Knight added: \\"At times I had to pinch myself and concentrate on the game. \\"The noise when we got the last wicket was a really special moment.

What is the answer to this question? where were the olympic games held for the first time in asia?","completion":"The Olympic Games were held for the first time in Asia in 1964, in the city of Tokyo, Japan. This significant event marked a historic milestone in the history of the Olympic Games, as it was the first time that the Games were held outside of Europe and North America, symbolizing the growing prominence and inclusion of Asian nations into the global sports arena. Tokyo's win to host the 1964 Olympics marked the beginning of a new era for the city, as well as for the country of Japan. Not only did it represent Japan's recovery and growth after World War II, but it also allowed the country to showcase its rapid advancements in technology and infrastructure to the rest of the world. The international attention this brought to Japan proved to be crucial in stimulating its economic boom in the decades that followed. The Tokyo Olympics featured 163 events in 19 different sports, with around 5,000 athletes from 93 participating nations. The Games were also unique for the introduction of several innovations, including the use of electronic timekeeping devices in various sporting events and the use of computers to quickly compile and disseminate necessary information to the media and spectators. Furthermore, one of the most iconic elements of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics was the Bullet Train or Shinkansen, which was inaugurated just nine days before the Opening Ceremony. This futuristic high-speed railway connected the city of Tokyo to Osaka in just about three hours, symbolizing Japan's rapid technological progress. Additionally, during the Games, Tokyo completed several infrastructure projects, including the Tokyo Monorail connecting Haneda Airport to the city center and the expansion of the city's subway system. These Games were memorable from a sporting perspective as well, with numerous outstanding performances and records. Some of the most notable feats included the domination of the Japanese women's volleyball team, which won the gold medal in a thrilling final against the Soviet Union, and the 10,000-meter race won by Ethiopian athlete Abebe Bikila, who became the first athlete to win two consecutive Olympic marathons. In conclusion, the first Olympic Games held in Asia took place in Tokyo, Japan, in 1964. These Games symbolized Japan's reintegration into the international community after World War II and allowed the country to showcase its technological prowess and economic growth. The 1964 Tokyo Olympics set the stage for the further globalization of the Olympic movement and paved the way for more Asian cities to host the Games in subsequent years, such as Seoul (1988) and Beijing (2008)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Tech companies team up to combat e-mail scams NEW YORK – Google, Facebook and other big tech companies are jointly designing a system for combating e-mail scams known as phishing. 15 major tech and financial companies have formed an organization to design a system for authenticating e-mails from legitimate senders. 15 major tech and financial companies have formed an organization to design a system for authenticating e-mails from legitimate senders. Such scams try to trick people into giving away passwords and other personal information by sending e-mails that look as if they come from a legitimate bank, retailer or other business. When Bank of America customers see e-mails that appear to come from the bank, they might click on a link that takes them to a fake site mimicking the real Bank of America's. There, they might enter personal details, which scam artists can capture and use for fraud. To combat that, 15 major technology and financial companies have formed an organization to design a system for authenticating e-mails from legitimate senders and weeding out fakes. The new system is called DMARC— short for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance. DMARC builds upon existing techniques used to combat spam. Those techniques are designed to verify that an e-mail actually came from the sender in question. The problem is there are multiple approaches for doing that and no standard way of dealing with e-mails believed to be fake. The new system addresses that by asking e-mail senders and the companies that provide e-mail services to share information about the e-mail messages they send and receive. In addition to authenticating their legitimate e-mails using the existing systems, companies can receive alerts from email providers every time their domain name is used in a fake message. They can then ask the e-mail providers to move such messages to spam folder or block them outright. According to Google, about 15% of non-spam messages in Gmail come from domains that are protected by DMARC. This means Gmail users \\"don't need to worry about spoofed messages from these senders,\\" Adam Dawes, a product manager at Google, said in a blog post. \\"With DMARC, large e-mail senders can ensure that the e-mail they send is being recognized by mail providers like Gmail as legitimate, as well as set policies so that mail providers can reject messages that try to spoof the senders' addresses,\\" Dawes wrote. Work on DMARC started about 18 months ago. Beginning Monday, other companies can sign up with the organization, whether they send e-mails or provide e-mail services. For e-mail users, the group hopes DMARC will mean fewer fraudulent messages and scams reaching their inbox. The group's founders are email providers Microsoft, Yahoo, AOLand Google; financial service providers Bank of America, Fidelity Investments and eBay's PayPal; online service companies Facebook, LinkedIn Corp. and American Greetings and security companies Agari, Cloudmark, eCert, Return Path and the Trusted Domain Project. Google uses it already, both in its e-mail sender and e-mail provider capacities. The heft of the companies that have already signed on to the project certainly helps, and its founders are hoping it will be more broadly adopted to become an industry standard.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: As Artificial Intelligence(AI) becomes increasingly sophisticated, there are growing concerns that robots could become a threat. This danger can be avoided, according to computer science professor Stuart Russell, if we figure out how to turn human values into a programmable code. Russell argues that as robots take on more complicated tasks, it's necessary to translate our morals into AI language. For example, if a robot does chores around the house, you wouldn't want it to put the pet cat in the oven to make dinner for the hungry children. \\"You would want that robot preloaded with a good set of values,\\" said Russell. Some robots are already programmed with basic human values. For example, mobile robots have been programmed to keep a comfortable distance from humans. Obviously there are cultural differences, but if you were talking to another person and they came up close in your personal space, you wouldn't think that's the kind of thing a properly brought-up person would do. It will be possible to create more sophisticated moral machines, if only we can find a way to set out human values as clear rules. Robots could also learn values from drawing patterns from large sets of data on human behavior. They are dangerous only if programmers are careless. The biggest concern with robots going against human values is that human beings fail to so sufficient testing and they've produced a system that will break some kind of taboo . One simple check would be to program a robot to check the correct course of action with a human when presented with an unusual situation. If the robot is unsure whether an animal is suitable for the microwave, it has the opportunity to stop, send out beeps , and ask for directions from a human. If we humans aren't quite sure about a decision, we go and ask somebody else. The most difficult step in programming values will be deciding exactly what we believe in moral, and how to create a set of ethical rules. But if we come up with an answer, robots could be good for humanity. Options: A It may constitute a challenge to computer progranmers. B It accompanies all machinery involving high technology. C It can be avoided if human values are translated into their language. D It has become an inevitable peril as technology gets more sophisticated.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: \\"How are you?\\" is a nice question. It's a friendly way that people in the USA greet each other. But \\"How are you\\" is also a very unusual question. It's a question that often doesn't need an answer. The person who asks \\"How are you?\\" hopes to hear the answer \\" Fine\\", even if the person's friend isn't fine. The reason is that \\"How are you?\\" isn't really a question and \\"Fine\\" isn't really an answer. They are simply other ways of saying \\"Hello\\" or \\"Hi\\". Sometimes, people also don't say exactly what they mean. For example, when someone asks \\"Do you agree?\\" the other person might think, \\"No, I disagree. I think you're wrong...\\" But it isn't very polite to disagree so strongly, so the other person might say \\"I'm not sure.\\" It's a nicer way to say that you don't agree with someone. People also don't say exactly what they are thinking when they finish talking with other people. For example, may talks over the phone finish when one person says \\"I've to go now.\\" Often, the person who wants to hang up gives an excuse \\"Someone's at the door.\\" \\"Something is burning on the stove.\\" The excuses might be real, or not. _ The excuse is more polite, and it doesn't hurt the other person. Whether they are greeting each other, talking about an idea, or finishing a talk, people don't say exactly that they are thinking. It's an important way that people try to be nice to each other, and it's part of the rule of the game of language. When a person disagree with someone, it is polite to say \\" _ \\". A) You are wrong. I disagree B) I'm not sure C) I'm sure I disagree D) No, I disagree Answer:","completion":"B) I'm not sure In the context of politeness and not being too direct when disagreeing with someone, the answer is B) \\"I'm not sure.\\" As mentioned in the passage, people often choose to express their disagreement in softer, more polite ways. Saying \\"I'm not sure\\" is a more gentle way to express doubt or disagreement without offending the other person or coming across as confrontational. People communicate in this manner to maintain harmony in their social interactions and to avoid causing discomfort or offense. The examples provided, such as \\"How are you?\\" and giving excuses when ending a phone conversation, serve as illustrations of indirect communication methods that people use to express their thoughts or feelings politely. By preserving a positive atmosphere in conversations, individuals can nurture relationships, avoid conflicts, and adapt to diverse social situations. This indirect communication style is some of the unspoken rules that people follow in the game of language, ensuring that empathy, respect, and consideration for others' feelings are maintained during interactions. So, when faced with a situation where you disagree with someone, choosing to say \\"I'm not sure\\" instead of directly stating your disagreement can be seen as a more tactful way to handle the situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: Crappy movie: bad acting, poor writing, horrible cinematography, lousy lighting. Matthew McConaughey plays a skinny, creapy, drug-crazed bisexual master of ceremonies, and Channing Tatum plays a character very similar except that he's buff and can dance unbelievably. Every actor and actress in the movie could use some acting lessons. I would have turned the movie off much sooner than I did were it not for the occassional glimpse at Channing's bare rear end. The whole movie reminded me of a bad all-male-review in a cheesy drag bar. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review is predominantly negative. The reviewer has communicated dissatisfaction with several elements of the film. Firstly, the film is referred to as 'crappy', followed by critiques against perceived 'bad acting', 'poor writing', 'horrible cinematography', and 'lousy lighting'. These descriptions are a clear indication of the reviewer's negative sentiments. Additionally, the characterizations and performances of the actors, Matthew McConaughey and Channing Tatum, are disparaged by the reviewer. He considers McConaughey's role as a 'skinny, creepy, drug-crazed bisexual master of ceremonies' as unsettling, while suggesting Tatum's role only holds merit due to his physical attributes and dancing ability, rather than the strength of his acting performance. Furthermore, the comment suggesting 'every actor and actress in the movie could use some acting lessons' is a direct, negative critique on the performing skills showcased in the film. However, there's a marginally positive tone associated with Channing Tatum's physical appeal. The reviewer acknowledges that glimpses of Tatum's 'bare rear end' momentarily captured his interests, thereby marginally improving the otherwise negative viewing experience. Lastly, the comparison of the entire film to 'a bad all-male-review in a cheesy drag bar' presents a vivid negative image, further emphasizing the reviewer’s overall criticism of the movie. Although this product review has a slight positive tone towards one actor's physical feature, it is significantly outweighed by the overall negative context, making the overall tone of this review decidedly negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Open Your Eyes If you have not seen this film and plan on doing so, just stop reading here and take my word for it. You have to see this film. I have seen it four times so far and I still haven't made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film. That is all I am going to say because if you have not seen this film, then stop reading right now. If you are still reading then I am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think. I remember my Grade 11 English teacher quite well. His name was Mr. Krisak. To me, he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you weren't all too keen on. If we didn't like Shakespeare, then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it. Our class room was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time. This was his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge-like minds. I begin this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind, like the phone number of a long lost best friend, and it finally made some sense to me after watching The Matrix. Now if I didn't know better, I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher Mr. Krisak. But giving them the benefit of the doubt, we'll assume it wasn't him. But that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable. He had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real. Show me how you can tell that you are real. This got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that I'm sure you can imagine. Everything from pain, to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real. After every scenario that we gave him, he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless. \\"What if you are nothing but someone else's dream?\\" What if you were someone else's dream? What a messed up question that is. This was a question/scenario posed to us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the Internet and rapid advancement of computers. How possible could it seem back then? But if you look at today's technology, now ask yourself, what it you were a part of someone else's dream. Another brilliant but surreal film this year, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive explored similar areas. But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to. In short this is one film that will literally (if you let it) blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you. Open your Eyes. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, hot shot, righteous, full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines. He inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy, his board of governers, the Seven Dwarfs, think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them. Early in the film we meet one of David's gorgeous toys named Julie Gianni, played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by Cameron Diaz. David and Julie play a good game, both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous, committed relationship. This is the type of relationship commensurate with David's other flings he's had in the sexual prime of his life. And although both talk a good game, we can tell that only one is really telling the truth. Next we meet Brian Shelby, played with a stroke of genius by Kevin Smith's good buddy Jason Lee. Brian is writing a book that David is going to publish but they are also very good friends. This is something that David has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film. Brian has one famous line that he keeps telling David over and over again. And that is \\" the sweet ain't so sweet without the bitter.\\" He goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two. At David's huge birthday bash, (so huge that the likes of Steven Spielberg wish him a happy birthday) Brian enters with his date, Sofia Sorrano, played of course by Penelope Cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress. This is a bash by invite only and at first David and Sofia seem intrigued with one another. And in typical David fashion, despite his best friend being there, he begins to flirt with Sofia. To complicate things, Julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on David. David then spends the night with Sofia, but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another. There is no hanky panky. The next day, as David is leaving Sofia's apartment, he is greeted by Julie, who offers him a ride and from there.......well, I think we have all seen the commercials. That is all I will really say about the plot, because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception. We are introduced to a character played by Kurt Russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze. There is a subtext of death and possible panacea-like cure-alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us, but it doesn't end there. Like many movies seem to thrive on today, this film has a secret. Sixth Sense may have began this craze, but look even further back and you can maybe thank Angel Heart for starting the craze. Regardless of how it originated, Vanilla Sky has one of it's own surreptitious gut busters. And what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through. I have seen this film four times and every time it has been because I want to see if there is something more I can pick up, something more I can understand. To be able to work your mind in the theater, to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film. All of the ersatz so called \\"Best Pictures of the year\\" have been good but nothing spectacular. They lack substance. A Beautiful Mind was intriguing but flat, The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven. Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it. I know this film has received mixed reviews but I just think that those who don't like it don't quite understand it. This is what film making is supposed to be like. This is what a film is supposed to do to you. It is supposed to make you feel something. Most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces. This one isn't. 10 out of 10 The best film of the year. I would love to see this get nominated for best picture and I would love to see Cruz up for best Actress, Diaz for best supporting, Cruise for best actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor. Cameron Crowe should there as well. None of this may come to pass, and that is a shame. This is one film that should not be missed. And on a final note, I am quite sure Mr. Krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question. Can you prove you are real? Or are we just a figment of someone's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted for someone else's bemusement? This is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers. And I'm sure that is just fine with him. Open Your Eyes How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is highly positive and enthusiastic.

There are several elements to consider when analyzing the sentiment behind this statement. 1. The phrase \\"blacked out\\": This refers to a sudden loss of consciousness, typically caused by reasons such as low blood sugar, dehydration, or more severe medical conditions. The act of blacking out is generally considered a negative or worrying event, as it may indicate an underlying health issue or physical ailment that requires immediate attention. Hence, mentioning \\"blacked out\\" in any context may instill a sense of concern or apprehension in the reader or listener. 2. The location \\"in the lobby\\": The lobby is a public space, generally found in buildings like hotels, theaters, or offices, where people gather or pass through. A blackout happening in the lobby signifies that this event took place in an area where others are likely present, increasing the potential for embarrassment, vulnerability, or public scrutiny. This aspect can amplify the negative sentiment attached to the statement, as the individual involved might feel humiliated or exposed in front of others. 3. The ambiguity of the situation: The sentence does not provide much context or information on the circumstances surrounding the event. It leaves the reader or listener with many questions, such as - What caused the blackout? Were there any serious consequences? Was any assistance provided? This ambiguity can create an atmosphere of uncertainty and concern, adding to the negativity of the statement. Given these elements, the sentiment of the sentence \\"blacked out in the lobby\\" can be perceived as negative, uncertain, or concerning in nature. However, it is essential to remember that context plays a significant role in determining the sentiment of any given statement. Depending on the situation or other circumstances mentioned alongside this sentence, the sentiment may vary accordingly. Additionally, the perception of the sentiment may differ from person to person, based on their individual experiences, attitudes, or beliefs."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

Article: Once you’ve decided to take a weekend getaway, choosing where to spend those precious 48 hours can be difficult. Thankfully, travellers planning a whirlwind holiday can now check out a full ranking of the top 100 cities around the world to take a much-needed – if short – vacation. Out of 1000 cities worldwide, the best destination to spend a weekend is London, according to the study commissioned by weekenGo. The travel app, which searches for weekend breaks, assessed cities on factors that could affect a weekend trip, such as time spent stuck in traffic, the availability of accommodation, and the number of social attractions like clubs, bars and music venues. The rankings also factored in the number of main tourist attractions such as museums and galleries, as well as safety, equality and tolerance. Overall, London was ranked first, followed by Berlin, Vienna, Hamburg, Paris, Amsterdam, New York City, Munich, Barcelona and Madrid. Since not all age groups are looking for the same type of holiday, the study also ranked the best destinations for millennials, families and baby boomers. The rankings change slightly when it comes to millennials, with higher rankings for social activities, bars, clubs and more. The top 10 spots are Berlin, London, Amsterdam, Vienna, Paris, Toronto, Zurich, Dublin, Munich and Edinburgh. For family travel, the top 10 cities are Vienna, Amsterdam, Prague, Tokyo, Zurich, Hamburg, Berlin, Edinburgh, London and Munich. Baby boomers should consider Zurich, Vienna, Hamburg, Edinburgh, Prague, Singapore, Vancouver, Tokyo, Munich and London. “Given the fact that we looked at over 1000 cities worldwide, every destination that made it to this top 100 ranking ought to be on your weekend getaway bucket list,” said Tobias Boese, co-founder and managing director of weekenGO, in a statement. “Cities at the top of the ranking such as London, Paris and New York are iconic for a reason, but those cities at the bottom of the ranking such as Casablanca and Belgrade still have a great deal to offer for an unforgettable weekend trip.” See the full rankings here. ||||| At weekenGO, we live and breathe weekend getaways, so the topic of which destination is best to visit is debated in our office on a daily basis. To settle the question, we decided to commission a study into the best cities to spend 48 hours. The goal of the study was not only to define which factors make a city great for short visits, but also which trips are best suited to different age groups and dynamics. To determine the criteria for the study, we looked at all the factors which could affect a weekend trip, such as time spent stuck in traffic and the availability of accommodation. Since different types of travellers look for different kinds of attractions, the study offers both a general overall ranking, and in addition splits the results to show which cities are best suited for millennials, families and baby boomers. The number of main tourist attractions such as museums and galleries were factored into the research, as well as safety, equality and tolerance. Calculating all scores, we were able to create the ultimate index of the best cities to spend a weekend. \\"Given the fact that we looked at over 1,000 cities worldwide, every destination that made it to this top 100 ranking ought to be on your weekend getaway bucket list.\\" commented Tobias Boese, co-founder and managing director of weekenGO. \\"Cities at the top of the ranking such as London, Paris and New York are iconic for a reason, but those cities at the bottom of the ranking such as Casablanca and Belgrade still have a great deal to offer for an unforgettable weekend trip.\\" The table below shows the overall ranking, as well as the individual ranking for millennials, families and baby boomers.

A volleyed goal from substitute Tadanari Lee in the second half of extra time earned Japan a 1-0 victory over Australia and a record fourth Asian Cup Saturday. Lee hammered home a cross from Yugo Nagatomo in the 109th minute to settle the clash and leave Holgar Osieck's Australia heartbroken at Qatar's Khalifa International Stadium. The Socceroos had twice gone close with Everton's Tim Cahill having an effort cleared off the line and winger Harry Kewell firing straight at goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima when clean through on goal. But Alberto Zaccheroni's \\"Blue Samurai\\" weathered the storm to add to their previous triumphs in 1992, 2000 and 2004 as Lee proved their hero.

The paragraph introduces a man holding an object in front of a camera. Choice (I): The man shines shoes and begins dancing while holding the object. - This choice mentions the man is holding an object and dancing which works with the paragraph. Choice (II): The man hooks a person's feet into the frame and lifts them up into the air. - This choice seems irrelevant, as it introduces a new person. There is no information about how the object is being used. Choice (III): The man begins dancing around the room with the object, moving his body all around. - This choice fits well, as it describes the man dancing with the object. Choice (IV): The man throws the object several more times while hitting a pinata. - Although the man is using the object, there is no mention of dancing or connecting to the initial scene. Based on the choices provided, I believe that Choice (III) is the most appropriate continuation of the paragraph because it keeps the focus on the initial scene with the man holding an object in front of a camera and incorporates dancing as an action. It also provides a logical continuation with the character's movement.

Nijgh was coached by Ernst van Altena , who had previously translated works by Jacques Brel . Nijgh was trained by Ernst van Altena , who had previously translated works by Jacques Brel .","completion":"Yes, the two sentences do have the same meaning. Here are the steps and justifications: 1. The subject of the sentences (\\"Nijgh\\") and the object (\\"Ernst van Altena\\") are the same in both sentences. This ensures that they refer to the same two individuals. 2. The verb \\"coached\\" in the first sentence is replaced with the verb \\"trained\\" in the second sentence. These two words generally mean the same thing, implying that Nijgh was guided or instructed by Ernst van Altena, making the overall meanings of the sentences the same. 3. The second part of the sentences (\\"who had previously translated works by Jacques Brel\\") is identical in both sentences. This ensures the sentences convey the same additional information about Ernst van Altena. 4. The structure and syntax used in both sentences are identical; only one verb has been substituted for another. Therefore, the overall meaning or intent of the sentences is preserved. In conclusion, the substitution of \\"coached\\" with \\"trained\\" won't affect the overall meaning, as both the words suggest that Ernst was helping Nijgh in some form of learning or skill improvement, thus the sentences indeed have the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? While everyone relaxes differently, find something that works for you. You may try simply visualizing a calming scene, releasing tension in your muscles, practicing breathing, or meditation. Try to work on a relaxation technique that can be done anywhere at anytime. This way, when you encounter your phobia, you can overcome your fear. Be as detailed as possible and include all types of experiences, from the mildly anxious to terrifying. This will help you tackle your fear at a variety of levels. For example, if you are afraid of heights, you might encounter them in the following situations: hiking on a mountain, flying in an air plane, and going up a sky scraper in an elevator. After compiling the list, you may notice similar variables between certain types of fear. For example, you may find that you have a terrifying reaction to flying and riding in an elevator. You may realize that both involve small spaces. If you have multiple phobias, such as snakes, spiders, and clowns, choose one to start with. It is easier to tackle one phobia at a time. Order your list of situations by how anxious or fearful they make you. Start your list with the situations that only make you mildly anxious or tense. Place the scariest situations towards the end of your list. For example, if you are afraid of dogs, your list might start off with simply looking at a picture of a dog, and progress to seeing a dog outside your window, across the street, and end with petting a large dog off its leash. Your list may not be very long or it can be incredibly lengthy. What matters is that you have a guide to deal with your phobia. You should start by visualizing the least upsetting item. Practice relaxing until you feel your muscles lose their tension. Once you've done this for a minute, take a break and repeat the exercise a few more times. Once you have mastered an item, move on to the next one until you've reached your most feared situation. Some items might take a lot longer to master than others. For example, you might get over looking at a picture of a spider a lot quicker than actually having to hold a spider in your hand. Don't be afraid to ask someone for help if you find yourself stuck, or unable to work through an item on your list. He or she may be able to help you work through your fear. Once you've worked through your situation list by visualizing and relaxing, find your phobia in real life. By now, you should be well trained in relaxing. Start with situations that produce little anxiety before encountering the scarier items on your list. Even once you've overcome your most dreaded fear, keep exposing yourself to it so that you don't let the fear return. This repeated exposure will allow you to manage your response. Perhaps one of the reasons you are so afraid of dogs is because you've had a bad experience with one as a child. Your mind held on to this, and turned it into a phobia. Once you conquered your fear of dogs and managed to pet a large dog without feeling anxious, go out and treat yourself. Have an ice cream cone or a fancy latte. Your mind may start to associate good things with the very thing you used to fear. Summary:","completion":"This article suggests overcoming phobias by identifying anxiety-triggering situations, ordering them by fear level, practicing relaxation techniques, and gradually visualizing and facing those fears in real life, ultimately rewiring the mind to associate positive experiences with the previously feared situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The statement you provided refers to the history of bed bug prevalence, not how they are acquired.

These factors include, but are not limited to, the clarity of the review, the persuasiveness of the reviewer's opinion, and the overall helpfulness of the review in informing potential users or consumers. 1) Clarity: The reviewer has expressed their thoughts in a concise and direct manner. The message is easily understood, and there is no ambiguity in the meaning. This factor scores a 4. 2) Persuasiveness: This aspect of the review is a bit subjective and depends on one's own preferences and expectations for what they seek in a music app or platform. The reviewer has mentioned \\"cool songs\\" and the fact that the app \\"doesn't use data.\\" For someone who appreciates music and is concerned about data usage, this review could be persuasive. However, for someone who may be seeking more insight into the features, this review may not be as persuasive. This factor scores a 3. 3) Helpfulness: Although the review is concise, it lacks information on the important elements such as sound quality, ease of use, and the variety of songs offered. Consequently, potential users or consumers may still have questions or require more information to make an informed decision. In terms of helpfulness, this factor scores a 2. Summing up the scores for the three factors (4+3+2 = 9) and dividing by the number of factors (3), the average score is 3. With this in mind, the review \\"Lots of cool songs and it doesn't use data\\" would be rated a 3 on the scale of 1-5, where 1 is the least favorable and 5 is the most favorable. This rating suggests that although the review has some positive qualities, there is room for improvement in its persuasiveness and overall helpfulness to potential users or consumers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. I know that the answer to the question \\"Who died first between Zheng Zhong and Emperor He?\\" is in \\"Emperor Zhang's (r. 75–88 AD) reign came to be viewed by later Eastern Han scholars as the high point of the dynastic house. Subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by eunuch intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power struggles of the imperial consort clans. With the aid of the eunuch Zheng Zhong (d. 107 AD), Emperor He (r. 88–105 AD) had Empress Dowager Dou (d. 97 AD) put under house arrest and her clan stripped of power. This was in revenge for Dou's purging of the clan of his natural mother—Consort Liang—and then concealing her identity from him. After Emperor He's death, his wife Empress Deng Sui (d. 121 AD) managed state affairs as the regent empress dowager during a turbulent financial crisis and widespread Qiang rebellion that lasted from 107 to 118 AD.\\".

You are also given a question about the story that requires an understanding of the relationship described in the background paragraph and the story. You need to come up with an answer to the given question; the answer will be a span from either the question or the story. In order to correctly answer the given question, you need to understand the relationship mentioned in the background paragraph and should be able to use it to understand that in the story. Your answer can not consist of any word that is not mentioned in any of these: the background paragraph, the story, or the question. You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Background Paragraph: Antifreeze could also be called “antiboil” because it also raises the boiling point of the water in a car radiator. Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the radiator above 100 °C, which is the boiling point of pure water. If the water boils, it could cause the engine to overheat and become seriously damaged. However, if antifreeze has been added to the water, the boiling point is much higher. For example a 50 percent antifreeze solution has a boiling point of 129 °C. Unless the water gets hotter than this, it won’t boil and ruin the engine. Story: John was driving through the Mohave desert. He first added antifreeze to the water in his radiator. He noted that in his journal as case A. Unfortunately, after some time he ran out of antifreeze, and couldn't add antifreeze any more. He noted that as case B. Question: In which case the engine would be hotter, case a or case B?

Explanation: Making ear plugs can be easily accomplished with materials that are soft, comfortable and can effectively reduce noise levels. Among the given options, cotton balls are a more suitable material for this purpose. Cotton is soft, lightweight, and less abrasive on the skin, making it more comfortable for use as earplugs. On the other hand, paper towels are not an ideal material for earplugs because they are less effective at reducing noise levels and may be uncomfortable when placed in the ears. Paper towel is more rigid and less malleable compared to cotton, which can cause discomfort during prolonged use, and it might not effectively conform to the shape of the ear canal, which could result in poor noise reduction."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Nephrons in the kidney filter the blood - The waste that is filtered out mixes with water - Become urine - Ureters carry urine out of the kidneys. Answer:","completion":"The first step missing in the provided process of urine formation and its transportation is: Blood enters the kidneys through the renal artery. This step is crucial as it ensures that blood is supplied to the kidneys for efficient filtration and waste removal. To better understand this process, let's discuss the renal system and its functional mechanism in a more detailed manner. 1. Blood enters the kidneys through the renal artery: The renal arteries, which branch off from the abdominal aorta, transport high-pressure blood into the kidneys. Efficient filtration in the kidney is dependent on a sufficient blood supply. 2. Nephrons in the kidney filter the blood: Nephrons are the functional units of the kidneys, and it's where the actual filtration process takes place. Kidneys contain around 1 million nephrons, which consist of a glomerulus and a renal tubule. The glomerulus is a network of capillaries where the filtration of blood occurs due to the pressure difference. This filtration of blood results in the formation of what is called the glomerular filtrate, which is composed of waste products, water, and other useful substances. 3. The waste that is filtered out mixes with water: As the glomerular filtrate moves through the renal tubule, a series of selective reabsorption and secretion processes occur. Useful substances, like glucose, amino acids, and water, are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream while waste products and excess ions are secreted into the tubule to form urine. 4. Become urine: The processed filtrate now contains high concentrations of waste products such as urea, creatinine, and excess electrolytes. This concentrated fluid, now referred to as urine, moves into the collecting ducts and then into the renal pelvis, the central funnel of the kidney. 5. Ureters carry urine out of the kidneys: From the renal pelvis, urine flows into the ureters, which are muscular tubes that transport urine to the urinary bladder. Through the process of peristalsis, rhythmic muscular contractions, the urine is actively pushed through the ureters towards the bladder for temporary storage. In conclusion, the missing first step in the process presented is: blood entering the kidneys through the renal artery. This step is vital for the initiation of filtration and waste removal in the renal system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Facebook link to Utah official opposing marriage equality Facebook has been spotted making another controversial campaign contribution. According to disclosures filed with the Utah Lieutenant Governor’s office, Facebook donated 10,000 to the campaign of the state’s attorney general, who is fighting to uphold Utah’s gay marriage ban. Last Tuesday, Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes filed an appeal against a lower court’s ruling striking down the state’s ban on same-sex marriage. “We recognize this litigation has caused uncertainty and disruption and have accordingly tried to expedite its resolution as quickly as possible,” he said in a statement at the time. Facebook, which made the donation in May, told Q SaltLake, which broke the story, that the company “has a strong record on LGBT issues and that will not change, but we make decisions about which candidates to support based on the entire portfolio of issues important to our business, not just one. “A contribution to a candidate does not mean that we agree with every policy or position that candidate takes. We made this donation for the same reason we’ve donated to Attorneys General on the opposite side of this issue – because they are committed to fostering innovation and an open Internet.” It is true, as CBS5 pointed out Sunday, in picking up the story, that Facebook “signed onto an amicus brief last March supporting proponents of marriage equality in Utah who challenged the state ban.” The station also noted that Facebook has contributed to firm believers in marriage equality, like California Attorney General Kamala Harris and Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring (D), who last week also filed an appeal to uphold that state’s marriage ban. “I believe the district and appeals courts ruled correctly in striking down Virginia’s discriminatory marriage ban, but it has long been clear that the Supreme Court will likely have the final word,” Herring said, explaining his involvement. Q SaltLake asked Facebook what issues Reyes supported that are important to Facebook. “He’s worked on Internet safety and patent reform,” a Facebook spokesperson responded.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Tingler Movie plot: A pathologist, Dr. Warren Chapin (Price), discovers that the tingling of the spine in states of extreme fear is due to the growth of a creature that every human being seems to have, called a \\"Tingler\\", a parasite attached to the human spine. It curls up, feeds and grows stronger when its host is afraid, effectively crushing the person's spine if curled up long enough. The host can weaken the creature and stop its curling by screaming. Movie theater owner Oliver Higgins (Coolidge), who shows exclusively silent films, is an acquaintance of Dr. Chapin. Higgins's wife Martha (Evelyn), who is deaf and mute, dies of fright after weird, apparently supernatural events have occurred in her room. During her autopsy, Chapin removes the Tingler from her spine. After they have contained the Tingler and return to Higgins' house, it is revealed that Higgins is the murderer; he frightened his wife to death knowing that she could not scream because she was mute. The centipede-like creature eventually breaks free from the container that held it in and is released into the theater where the deaf mute woman ran before she died. Chapin wishes not to tell anyone, knowing it would start a panic. The Tingler latches onto a woman's leg, and she screams until it releases its grip. Chapin controls the situation by shutting off the lights and telling everyone in the theater to scream. When the Tingler has left the showing room, they resume the movie and go to the projection room where they find the Tingler and capture it.

Ms Rousseff, who says her opponents are plotting a \\"coup\\", faces claims she manipulated government accounts. She has vowed to fight to \\"the last minute\\" despite the desertion of three allied parties ahead of Sunday's vote in the lower house of parliament. The Supreme Court made its decision in an extraordinary session. The impeachment debate in the lower house of parliament is due to start later on Friday and continue until Sunday's vote. If two-thirds of MPs vote for impeachment, the motion will pass to the Senate. An impeachment vote would pave the way for Ms Rousseff to be removed from office. Thursday's injunction to suspend the vote was filed by Attorney General Jose Eduardo Cardozo who claimed that alleged procedural failings had violated the president's right to a defence. Seven of 10 justices voted to reject the motion even before the Supreme Court session had finished. The Progressive Party (PP), which quit the coalition on Tuesday, says most of its 47 MPs would vote for the impeachment, and the Republican Party (PRB) said its 22 members had been told to vote in favour. The move comes weeks after the PMDB, the largest party in the lower house, voted to leave the coalition. The PMDB's leader in the lower house, Leonardo Picciani, said on Thursday that 90% of the party's members would vote to impeach Ms Rousseff. MPs from her own Workers' Party are said to be increasingly despondent about Sunday's vote. The allegations, which Ms Rousseff denies, are that she juggled the accounts to make her government's economic performance appear better than it was, ahead of her election campaign two years ago. The president's supporters say the issue is not valid grounds for impeachment. On Tuesday, Ms Rousseff seemed to suggest that her Vice-President, Michel Temer, was one of the ringleaders of the \\"coup\\" attempt against her. She said a widely distributed audio message of Mr Temer appearing to accept replacing her as president was evidence of the conspiracy. However, she did not identify him by name. Brazil is \\"living in strange times\\", she said, \\"times of a coup, of farce and betrayal\\". MPs are due to start debating on Friday, with voting beginning on Sunday at about 14:00 (17:00 GMT). The result should be known later in the evening. Security is expected to be stepped up around the Congress building in Brasilia as the vote takes place. While President Rousseff's opponents say the impeachment is supported by most Brazilians, the president's supporters have labelled it a flagrant power grab by her political enemies. If the president and Mr Temer were both suspended from office, the next in line to assume the presidency would be lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha. However, he is facing money-laundering and other charges. 513 members of the lower house of Congress 342 votes needed to move process to the Senate 41 senators out of 81 must vote in favour to begin impeachment trial 180 days she could be suspended for during the hearings Lower house vote: An impeachment vote is expected in the lower house on Sunday. A two-thirds majority is required for it to go forward to the Senate. Senate vote on trial: If Ms Rousseff case is sent to the Senate, a simple majority is enough to suspend her for up to 180 days while she is put on trial. Vice-President Michel Temer would step in during this period. Impeachment vote: For Ms Rousseff to be removed from office permanently, two-thirds of the Senate would have to vote in favour. Mr Temer would remain president for an interim period should this happen. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"This article is about the President of Brazil, Ms Rousseff.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that recorded with the Hawks? After his tour, Dylan returned to New York, but the pressures increased. ABC Television had paid an advance for a TV show. His publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula. Manager Albert Grossman had scheduled a concert tour for the latter part of the year. On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle near his home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized. Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him. Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: \\"I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.\\" Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit D. A. Pennebaker's film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to ABC Television, which rejected it as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience. The film was subsequently titled Eat the Document on bootleg copies, and it has been screened at a handful of film festivals. In 1967 he began recording with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, \\"Big Pink\\". These songs, initially demos for other artists to record, provided hits for Julie Driscoll and the Brian Auger Trinity (\\"This Wheel's on Fire\\"), The Byrds (\\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\", \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\"), and Manfred Mann (\\"Mighty Quinn\\"). Columbia released selections in 1975 as The Basement Tapes. Over the years, more songs recorded by Dylan and his band in 1967 appeared on bootleg recordings, culminating in a five-CD set titled The Genuine Basement Tapes, containing 107 songs and alternative takes.

Choices: - wonderful - forest - surface of earth - recycle bin - garden The rationale to choose \\"surface of earth\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"The term \\"compost\\" refers to an organic matter that has been decomposed and subsequently recycled as a natural fertilizer, soil amendment, or a conditioning agent. It is a product of composting, which is the controlled process of breaking down organic waste materials into nutrient-rich humus. Compost is primarily found on the surface of the earth, as it is derived from decomposing plant, animal, and other organic matter. Here is the rationale to choose \\"surface of earth\\" as the answer to the question: I. Environmental Presence Compost can be found throughout many ecosystems across the surface of the earth. It is specifically present in environments where decomposition or degradation occurs, such as forests, grasslands, farmlands, gardens, and other similar ecosystems. Within these ecosystems, decomposers like bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms help break down dead plant material, animal carcasses, and other organic matter into simpler compounds. II. Human-made Compost Production In addition to occurring naturally, compost can also be artificially engineered by humans. People often create compost piles within their gardens or on other areas of land. In this artificial composting process, organic waste materials, including kitchen scraps, garden waste, and yard trimmings are collected and mixed with soil, water, and air to create a nutrient-rich compost. This process manipulates the environmental factors to accelerate decomposition, producing compost in a shorter amount of time. III. Agricultural and Horticultural Applications Compost has a wide range of applications in agriculture and horticulture due to its numerous benefits. It helps improve soil structure, increase water retention, reduce soil erosion, and provide vital nutrients for plant growth. Farmers, gardeners, and landscapers use compost to improve soil quality, promote plant health, and minimize the need for synthetic fertilizers. They integrate compost into the soil on the surface of the earth to enhance their plant productivity and sustainability. While some of the options provided in the question do contain elements of truth, they are not comprehensive enough to encapsulate the full scope of where compost can be found: 1. Wonderful - This option is more of an adjective and does not provide a specific location or context in which to find compost. 2. Forest - Although forests are places where natural composting processes occur, this option does not cover the entirety of locations where compost can be found. 3. Recycle Bin - This pertains more to the collection and disposal of recyclable materials, which are typically paper, plastic, metal, and glass items. Organic waste collected for composting generally goes into compost bins or piles, not recycling bins. 4. Garden - This is a narrow setting where compost is often used, but again, it limits the scope and does not fully encompass all the environments where compost can be located. Thus, \\"surface of earth\\" serves as the most comprehensive and appropriate answer to the question of where compost can be found. It covers the various natural environments, human-made composting processes, and the agricultural and horticultural applications of compost."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate to English English:","completion":"Transitioning to the Bologna model in the entire European higher education system has already significantly complicated the access of master's degree graduates to doctoral studies. The Bologna model, also known as the Bologna Process, is a series of agreements between European countries designed to harmonize and streamline their higher education systems. Introduced in 1999, the model aims to create a unified European Higher Education Area (EHEA) that promotes increased mobility, employability, and quality of education throughout Europe. One of the main elements of the Bologna model is the introduction of a three-cycle system, which consists of the bachelor's degree, the master's degree, and the doctorate. Each cycle builds upon the previous one, and students are expected to fulfill specific program requirements to progress from one cycle to the next. This structured approach is intended to facilitate the recognition of qualifications across EHEA member countries and to make the European higher education system more competitive globally. However, the implementation of the Bologna model has generated some challenges for students pursuing doctoral studies, particularly those who have obtained a master's degree according to the new system. Some of these challenges include: 1. Increased competition: The standardization of master's degrees across European countries has led to a larger pool of similarly qualified candidates applying for a limited number of doctoral positions. This increased competition may obstruct entry to doctoral programs for many capable students. 2. Length of study: The Bologna model has affected the duration of study at different levels, with many master's programs being shortened to accommodate the two-year degree framework. As a result, some students may not have acquired enough research experience or expertise in their field by the time they complete their master's degree, making their transition to doctoral studies more difficult. 3. Adaptation by universities: Universities across Europe have adapted to the Bologna model with varying degrees of success. In some cases, this has led to inconsistencies in the application and admission processes for doctoral programs, creating additional barriers for prospective PhD students. 4. Diversity of educational backgrounds: Prior to the Bologna model, each country had its higher education system with unique degrees and qualifications. Transitioning to a unified structure has posed challenges in recognizing and comparing the diverse educational backgrounds of students, making it challenging to assess their suitability for doctoral studies. 5. Funding issues: The implementation of the Bologna model has raised concerns regarding the funding and availability of doctoral programs, particularly in countries facing financial constraints. This may result in fewer opportunities for all students pursuing a doctorate, regardless of their qualifications and achievements. As a result of these challenges, access to doctoral studies for master's degree graduates under the Bologna model may be more difficult than anticipated. However, the Bologna Process is still evolving, with ongoing discussions and reforms aimed at addressing these issues and enhancing the overall quality and coherence of the European higher education system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Upper Austria had been rebellious for centuries, with 62 known uprisings between 1356 and 1849, 14 of which occurred in the 16th century. However, the Peasants' War of 1626 was the costliest in terms of human life and damage to livestock and property. The war caused Martin Aichinger to lose his farm and begin roaming the country. He eventually became a religious leader who led a popular revolt against aristocratic rule. His revolutionary ideas frightened the rulers so much that they tried to arrest him, leading to another series of uprisings that ended in the Battle on the Frankenberg in 1636. All of Aichinger's followers were slaughtered during the battle, including the remaining women and children who had been in hiding. Answer this question: How many years after the Peasants' War of 1626 was it before the Battle on the Frankenberg?","completion":"To calculate the number of years between the Peasants' War of 1626 and the Battle on the Frankenberg in 1636, I can simply subtract the starting year from the ending year: 1636 (year of the Battle on the Frankenberg) - 1626 (year of the Peasants' War) = 10 years So, it was 10 years after the Peasants' War of 1626 before the Battle on the Frankenberg took place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hospital If a person requires urgent care for a wound, the best options for them would be to visit an emergency room (D) or the hospital (E). Both of these locations are equipped to handle medical emergencies and provide immediate care to patients. Although the other choices (A, B, and C) do involve related concepts, they are not the place a person should go for urgent medical care. An emergency room is specifically designed to treat patients with severe conditions, sudden injuries, or those experiencing life-threatening emergencies. They are staffed with highly trained medical professionals who are prepared to deliver rapid treatment and are open 24/7. When a person arrives at the emergency room, they will be assessed and triaged based on the severity of their condition. If the wound is determined to need urgent care, the individual will receive prompt treatment. This may include cleaning and dressing the wound, administering antibiotics, providing stitches, or even performing surgery if necessary. A hospital is another appropriate location to seek urgent care for a severe wound. Hospitals encompass a wider range of services than emergency rooms, but they also include emergency departments that can deliver immediate attention and care. In some cases, smaller or rural hospitals may not have separate emergency rooms, but they can still offer urgent care services to patients in need. Additionally, if a person initially goes to an immediate care or urgent care facility but is found to require more extensive treatment, they may be referred or transported to a hospital for further care. In summary, if a person needs urgent care for a wound, they should seek immediate medical attention at an emergency room (D) or a hospital (E).

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose biography was Michael Kennedy? from the following article ? Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Rapper Chinx's funeral includes heavy NYPD presence The widow of slain rapper Chinx wore white while many of the mourners filing into a Queens cathedral to say farewell Tuesday were clad in black. But all around the Greater Allen A.M.E Cathedral of New York the dominant color was blue — NYPD blue. Norman Seabrook, head of the Correction Officers’ union and a cousin of the 31-year-old performer, noted the heavy police presence during his eulogy — and even asked for a round of applause for the cops. “Violence has hit home,” he said after the service, as the rapper’s coffin was being loaded into a hearse. “He’s a kid who turned his life around and he gets assassinated. The police are doing a good job. Let's hope they catch somebody.” Born Lionel Pickens, the rapper was killed in a drive-by shooting early May 17. Police still don’t have a suspect — or a motive. Before the funeral service, friends and loved ones filed inside the sanctuary to pay their respects at the open brown casket where Pickens lay dressed in a gray suit and surrounded by white roses. His grieving wife, Janelli Caceres, wore white jeans and a white top with the words “Baby Chinx” emblazoned on the back. Two large screens set up nearby showed photographs of the rapper in happier days — with his wife and their three kids, at birthday bashes or hanging with friends. Pickens was described in the funeral program as a “jokester” who “influenced many with his music and his drive to get to the top of the hip hop industry.” Choking back tears, the rapper’s manager told mourners he would “keep his legacy alive.” “His goal and his intention was to leave a mark and he’s done that,” said Doug Ellison. Pickens and a pal were in a silver Porsche on Queens Blvd. near 84th Drive in Briarwood when a gunman pulled up beside them and opened fire, police said. Shot multiple times, Pickens was pronounced dead at Jamaica Hospital. His friend, Antar (Yemen Cheee) Alziadi, 27, was wounded but survived. A product of the Redfern Houses in Far Rockaway, Pickens was no stranger to trouble. As a minor he was charged with attempted murder in 1999. Three years later, his rapping career was nearly derailed when he was busted for armed robbery and for selling crack a year later. He wound up serving four years in prison. Those experiences became the grist for songs like “Bodies,” in which Pickens rapped about his life of crime and violence. Pickens was killed eight years after his mentor Stack Bundles, real name Rayquon Elliott, was gunned down at the Redfern Houses. Police suspect the killings might be related. Pickens had performed as a member of French Montana's Coke Boys crew and recently collaborated with rappers Too Short and Meek Mill. Montana, real name Karim Kharbouch, is the sometime boyfriend of reality TV star Khloé Kardashian. He reportedly helped pay for Pickens’ funeral. Summary:","completion":"The funeral of rapper Chinx included a heavy presence of NYPD officers. The rapper, born Lionel Pickens, was killed in a drive-by shooting on May 17, and the police currently have no suspects or motive. Those attending the funeral paid their respects and Chinx's manager, Doug Ellison, vowed to \\"keep his legacy alive.\\" Chinx had faced legal troubles in the past, which informed much of his music.

Q:This article: Makeba was among the most visible people campaigning against the apartheid system in South Africa, and was responsible for popularising several anti-apartheid songs, including \\"Meadowlands\\" by Strike Vilakezi and \\"Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd\\" (Watch out, Verwoerd) by Vuyisile Mini. Due to her high profile, she became a spokesperson of sorts for Africans living under oppressive governments, and in particular for black South Africans living under apartheid. When the South African government prevented her from entering her home country, she became a symbol of \\"apartheid's cruelty\\", and she used her position as a celebrity by testifying against apartheid before the UN in 1962 and 1964. Many of her songs were banned within South Africa, leading to Makeba's records being distributed underground, and even her apolitical songs being seen as subversive. She thus became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government both within and outside South Africa. In an interview in 2000, Masekela said that \\"there [was] nobody in Africa who made the world more aware of what was happening in South Africa than Miriam Makeba.\\"Makeba has also been associated with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: \\"Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The Black people are the victims of capitalism, racism and oppression, period\\". After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that \\"black is beautiful\\".

Summarize: The 58-year-old former Bournemouth, Doncaster Rovers, Crawley Town, Nottingham Forest and Bristol City manager has signed an 18-month deal. O'Driscoll, who won promotion with both Bournemouth and Doncaster, replaces Dean Smith, who left the Saddlers to join Brentford in November. \\"It's an exciting project,\\" he said. \\"I'm relishing the opportunity.\\" Walsall are now third in League One, a place higher than when Smith and his assistant Richard O'Kelly departed on 30 November. They have since spent three matches under the joint caretaker management team of physio Jon Whitney, goalkeeping coach Neil Cutler and the vastly experienced John Ward, who will all remain on the Bescot backroom team. Whitney is promoted to the role of first team & performance coach, Cutler becomes coach, with a focus on the goalkeepers, and the much-travelled Ward retains his role as performance development coach, with the primary aim of nurturing the Saddlers' young professionals. O'Driscoll was appointed assistant manager by Liverpool in the summer but left Anfield in October after Brendan Rodgers was sacked, prior to Jurgen Klopp's arrival. \\"I've watched Walsall a lot over the last two or three seasons. I've always enjoyed coming here,\\" new Saddlers boss O'Driscoll told BBC WM. \\"I know Dean Smith and Richard O'Kelly well. We share the same philosophy. I know the things they've tried to instil. It's taken a long time but the club is now reaping the rewards. That was the attraction. \\"I spent some time with them on the training ground about a month ago and you could see the players are committed to it, that they're a group of players who want to be successful. \\"Walsall have gained the sort of reputation that can take years to bring to fruition and can be destroyed in seconds. I've no intention of doing that. \\"You're not going to improve it by suddenly reversing everything they've been doing. That would cause chaos. But can we take it to the next level? That's to win the games we've been drawing and draw the games we've lost and see where that takes us at the end of the season.\\" Walsall chairman Jeff Bonser believes O'Driscoll will continue the club's philosophy of producing young players and playing attractive football. \\"Sean ticks all the boxes in terms of the identity, blueprint and ethos that we work towards,\\" he said. \\"We believe in his ability to advance the football club, enhance our growing reputation as a progressive, forward-thinking organisation in what we hope will be an exciting new chapter at the club.\\" As a player, Wolverhampton-born O'Driscoll played for two league clubs, Fulham and Bournemouth, where he made a then club record 423 league appearances before joining the coaching staff at Dean Court. He took over as Bournemouth manager from Mel Machin in August 2000, leading them to promotion in the Third Division play-offs in May 2003. After joining Doncaster in 2006, O'Driscoll led them into the Championship, beating Leeds 1-0 in the 2008 League One play-off final. A short spell at Crawley followed before he left to return to Nottingham Forest, where he had previously been assistant to Steve Cotterill, in July 2012. He was sacked after just five months following a 4-2 Boxing Day win over Leeds, with the club a point off the Championship top six. His last managerial job was at Bristol City, but he was unable to save them from relegation to League One and lasted just 10 months before being replaced by Cotterill, who he himself had replaced at Forest. He was appointed England Under-19s coach in September 2014, a job he did for nine months until becoming Rodgers' assistant at Liverpool.

Answer this: When performing an experiment for a science fair, what should be done if the data do not support the hypothesis?","completion":"If the data from a science fair experiment do not support the hypothesis, one should follow these steps: Step 1: Analyze the data Thoroughly analyze the data collected during the experiment to ensure there haven't been any errors during the data collection process. This might involve double-checking measurements, reviewing calculations, and confirming the accuracy of the data. Justify this step by ensuring that the data is correct and has been collected consistently. Step 2: Reevaluate the experiment design Review the experimental design and procedures to ensure they were appropriately carried out. Confirm that the experiment was conducted in a controlled manner, and all variables were appropriately managed. Justifying this step helps in identifying possible issues in the experimental design that may have lead to unexpected results. Step 3: Consider alternative explanations If the data and experimental design appear to be sound, consider whether there may be alternative explanations for the observed results. Explore these possibilities and determine if any adjustments can be made to the experiment to test these alternatives. Justify this step by expanding the understanding of the research topic and considering factors that may have been previously overlooked. Step 4: Modify the hypothesis Based on the new findings, modifications may be made to the original hypothesis. The updated hypothesis should better align with the experimental results, taking into account any new insights or factors that have been uncovered. Justify this step by allowing the research question to evolve based on the evidence gathered, leading to more refined or accurate hypotheses. Step 5: Conduct additional experiments With the revised hypothesis, perform new experiments designed around the updated premise. This will generate more data for analysis and may provide further support or refutation of the modified hypothesis. Justify this step as it gives an opportunity to gather more evidence, ultimately increasing confidence in the findings and conclusions. Step 6: Report the findings In the science fair presentation, honestly report the original hypothesis and the results of the experiment, even if the data did not support the hypothesis. Explain the process followed, the modifications made to the hypothesis, and any additional experiments conducted. Justify this step as honesty and transparency are crucial in scientific research, and unexpected results often lead to interesting investigations and discoveries. By following these steps, a science fair participant can maintain scientific integrity and continue to learn from the experiment, even if the data do not support the original hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: For example, if a solid pellet of NaOH is placed into a chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur between gaseous HCl molecules and hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet. If we were to grind the pellet into smaller pieces, it would greatly increase the total surface area, and therefore the overall reaction rate. Once ground up, many hydroxide ions that were on the interior of the pellet, where they were not exposed to any HCl molecules, will now be on the surface, where the necessary collisions can occur. Now, I have a new situation: In his chemistry lab David is experimenting with how NaOH and HCl gas reacts with each other. He conducted two experiments, experiment A and experiment B. In experiment A he used solid pellets of NaOH, but in experiment B he used ground NaOH. He was surprised to see the difference it made in his experiment. Answer this question please: Would experiment B's hydroxide have smaller or larger surface area than experiment A's hydroxide?","completion":"In experiment B, where the NaOH pellets were ground up, the hydroxide would have a larger surface area compared to experiment A, where solid pellets of NaOH were used. This increase in surface area enables a faster reaction rate between the NaOH and gaseous HCl, as more hydroxide ions are exposed to HCl molecules, allowing for more collisions and thus a quicker reaction overall."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Detailed Instructions: Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not. The claim asks if the posts are historical or hypothetical. The posts are \\"HISTORICAL\\" when the author has already done something and they are \\"HYPOTHETICAL\\" when the author is considering doing something in the future. Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no' Problem:CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : So I live in an apartment with three other girls. Two of them are graduating this semester, so we need to replace them on the lease. The roommate that’s staying, that I’ll call Emma, and I agreed we’d start searching after the new year. Well I put up a few Facebook posts, and we’ve gotten around seven responses so far. Some we agreed were bad, some I liked. Emma liked none of them, and she has twice now gone against an applicant just because they were a freshman. This means they would be a sophomore when they move in. She says that you can’t trust freshmen to pay the rent on time, or that they’re crazy and unpredictable. I fee she’s being too judgemental. On top of that, Emma is holding out for that “perfect” roommate. She doesn’t want to settle this early, thinking if we wait, we’ll find someone else that didn’t want to settle. What I think will happen is that every good roommate will have found a place to stay, and we’ll be left with a bunch of procrastinators who are an actual risk for not paying rent on time. I don’t think this “perfect” roommate exists, let alone two of them. I want to give the freshmen a chance, but Emma seems adamant. AITA? Are freshmen really that bad? Am I rushing this? Solution:","completion":"The task is to determine if the given claim about a post being historical or hypothetical is true or not. Step 1: Understand the definitions of historical and hypothetical. - Historical means the author has already experienced the situation or carried out the action. - Hypothetical means the author is considering doing something in the future or is in a situation that has not been resolved yet. Step 2: Carefully read the given post and identify key indicators to help you decide if it is a historical or hypothetical situation. Step 3: Analyze the post based on the definitions: - In the given post, the author and their roommate, Emma, are in the process of finding new roommates to replace the two who are graduating this semester. - They have received responses from potential roommates, but Emma is being selective and not agreeing on the applicants. - The author is asking for opinions on whether they should give freshmen a chance or not, and if they are rushing the decision. Step 4: Determine if the claim is true or not based on your analysis: - The post describes an ongoing situation, and the author is considering how to proceed with finding new roommates. - Therefore, the post is hypothetical, not historical. Step 5: Answer the question: - In this case, the claim is \\"The following post is HISTORICAL.\\" Based on the analysis, the claim is not true.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: If a person saw wings on a helmet, where would they be? Possible A: airport, heaven, detroit, flight school, airplane Why is \\"detroit\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"The possible answer \\"Detroit\\" may initially seem unrelated to the question, \\"If a person saw wings on a helmet, where would they be?\\", but it can be aligned with human common sense when we consider it from a different angle. In order to understand the connection, we must dive into some background information and associations. Detroit is a major city in the United States, located in the state of Michigan. It is known for its industrial development, particularly in the automotive industry. Detroit is often referred to as the \\"Motor City\\" because it has been one of the largest centers for automobile manufacturing in the United States since the early 20th century. Additionally, it is home to three major professional sports teams: the Detroit Tigers (baseball), the Detroit Lions (football), and the Detroit Red Wings (ice hockey). The association between Detroit and the question lies within the name of the ice hockey team, the Detroit Red Wings. The Red Wings' logo features a winged wheel, which bears an obvious visual connection to wings on a helmet. While the question does not specifically mention the Red Wings, human common sense can draw the connection based on the proximity of the word \\"wings\\" to the name of a popular sports team. Moreover, the Red Wings' hockey players wear helmets that have the iconic winged wheel logo on them. So if someone saw wings on a helmet, it could be inferred that they are referring to the logo on the hockey helmets worn by members of the Detroit Red Wings. Assuming that the person answering or asking the question has some knowledge or interest in sports, specifically ice hockey, and is aware of the Detroit Red Wings team, the answer \\"Detroit\\" can be considered as aligned with human common sense. This answer may not be the first choice for every individual, as it depends on the person's familiarity with the subject matter, but it does provide a valid connection worthy of consideration. In conclusion, although the answer \\"Detroit\\" might not be the most obvious or universally accepted answer to the question about wings on a helmet, it is an answer that is within the realm of human common sense, particularly for those familiar with the Detroit Red Wings and their helmet logo."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I read this background article the other day: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. I am facing a new situation today: Kim and Jane inherited some land. Kim inherited some grassland, while Jane inherited a forest. They both took good care of their properties. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person inherited a parcel where fewer fires occurred? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, Jane, who inherited the forest, likely inherited a parcel with fewer fires occurring compared to Kim's grassland.

North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met. Moon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On Saturday Moon said Kim reaffirmed his commitment to end his country’s nuclear weapons program, but shared his key concern that the U.S. would work to destabilize his rule despite any security guarantees it offers. “What is uncertain for Chairman Kim Jong Un is not his willingness for denuclearization, but he has concerns over whether North Korea can trust the fact that Washington will end its hostile relations, and guarantee the security...

In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, published on Dylan's website, Dylan explained that the genesis of the record was when French film director Olivier Dahan asked him to supply a song for his new road movie, My Own Love Song; initially only intending to record a single track, \\"Life Is Hard,\\" \\"the record sort of took its own direction\\". Nine of the ten songs on the album are credited as co-written by Bob Dylan and Robert Hunter.The album received largely favorable reviews, although several critics described it as a minor addition to Dylan's canon of work. Andy Gill wrote in The Independent that the record \\"features Dylan in fairly relaxed, spontaneous mood, content to grab such grooves and sentiments as flit momentarily across his radar. So while it may not contain too many landmark tracks, it's one of the most naturally enjoyable albums you'll hear all year.\\"In its first week of release, the album reached number one in the Billboard 200 chart in the U.S., making Bob Dylan (67 years of age) the oldest artist to ever debut at number one on that chart.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect.

We have the equation, 42 * l + 42 = 48 * l. 1. First, let's try to get all the \\"l\\" (let's think of l like apples) on one side of the equal sign and the numbers on the other side. To do that, we need to get rid of 42 * l from the right side. 2. Since we are going to move the 42 * l (42 apples times the number l) from the left side to the right side, we will subtract 42 * l from both sides of the equation. 3. So the equation now will look like this: 42 = 48 * l - 42 * l. 4. Now, we need to simplify the right side. Since 48 * l and 42 * l both have \\"l\\" (apples), we can easily combine them. We have 48 apples minus 42 apples which equals 6 apples. So the right side of the equation will become just 6 * l. 5. Our simplified equation looks like this: 42 = 6 * l. 6. Now, we need to find the number of \\"l\\" (apples) that will make this equation true. To do that, we have to figure out what number we can multiply with 6 to get 42. 7.

Q:U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans.

I even got yummy ice cream from their ice cream stand. My ice cream was blue like the ocean and tasted like sweet, sugary bubblegum!

By contrast, the Wordsmith platform can produce up to 2,000 articles a second! Wordsmith is one example of natural language-generation software, often referred to as a robot journalist. To be fair, the software doesn't start from the beginning, like a human writer might. Instead, the software takes a set of structured data and transforms it into readable text. Natural language-generation software, such as Wordsmith and Quill, does its work by identifying trends and highlights in sets of data. The software then searches its own dictionary for the words to express its findings.[:] Why keep human writers around Although this type of software writes faster than any human, it requires sets of structured data to work. That's why it's especially useful for writing earnings reports and other types of \\"dry\\" writing. Humans, on the other hand, are good at turning their unstructured thoughts directly into prose. The reports produced by Wordsmith and Quill read naturally, and they can match the tone of human writers. But for now, the robot journalists probably won't steal many jobs or win any Pulitzer Prizes! Current applications of natural language-generation software Financial reports: The software is commonly used by banks or traders to analyze large amounts of financial data and then produce reports in plain English.

In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\") and the answer to that question. Your task is to classify whether the given answer is correct or not by providing \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\", based on the article. Article: Most of us long for relationships in which we are loved and accepted. Our hearts' desire is to give and receive love in relationships that make us feel that even if others disagree with what we do or say, they still love us, accept us, and appreciate what we give to the world. While it would be wonderful to have these types of relationships with all people, we know that's hard to do. However, we can have such relationships with some others, but only when we first have them with ourselves--and, strangely, this is often the hardest relationship of all. Do you love yourself? You may think you do, but do you really? There's only one way to find out-- by taking a close look at what you think, say, and do. You may not like some of what you find, but if you are serious about really loving yourself, you can use this insight to do some positive inner work. Here're three ways for gaining greater personal insight for deeper love: Listen Closely to Your Thoughts Your thoughts will determine your actions. One thing helping you to listen to your thoughts is keeping a journal. It is not necessary for you to write in it every day, but it helps to record various insights you gain as you go about your life. Instead of using a big notebook, you might use a small notepad that you can keep in your pocket for easy access to record your thoughts as they occur to you. Whichever method you choose, what's most important is that you write your thoughts down. It will help you know what's in your heart. Be Honest with Yourself To do this, you should pay attention to your actions. Actions speak louder than words, and they always tell the truth. If you say you love your job, but your actions say otherwise, which do you think is more reliable? On the other hand, if you say you're not good at a certain job, but your actions say otherwise, that's also important. What do you do with this insight? You can use it to make more positive choices in your life. By being honest with yourself, you will act according to truth instead of just what you tell yourself. Take Quiet Time to Listen to Your Inner Voice This is similar to the first point, but it takes a step further-- beyond the natural mind to the heart that cannot be seen. You may want to use your quiet time to think deeply. However you use this time, the key is to shut out all of the noise around you by focusing deep within yourself. Breathing deeply during quiet time will also help you focus. I know it's hard to find quiet time during a particularly busy day, but it's so important-- even if it's just 10 minutes a day and you have to hide somewhere to get it. Quiet time can really make a difference in your life. Despite what your mind may be telling you, you can have love with no limits. The key is to unconditionally love yourself first. Question: . By looking deep into what we think, say, and do, we can_.

Article: I don't have too many memories of my father because he was so sick in the last years of his life. But there aresome that I am often reminded of and which may have developed my love ofscience. When I was small, I was somewhatafraid of lightning and thunder . My father explained it. The explanation wasin words that a child could understand but was basically correct. I gained a betterunderstanding and learnt something from him. What he said was that there was electricity in the cloudsand it traveled to the ground like a spark . When it traveled through the air, it made the air so hot that it burned. Then there was nothing where the air had been and the air all around rushed in to fill the space. Saying this, he clapped his hands together very loudly, pretending to be the air rushing in, and said that makes the thunder. When I hear thunder, I can still hear that clap clearly. He also explained why a cloudy winter night was warmer than a clear one. When there were clouds, they were like blankets which kept the earth and us warm. He said that if there were no clouds, we had no blankets and were _ to the universe. Our warmth was going toheat the whole universe. Even today, I still feel on the edge of space on a very clear night. I am sure there were many other lessons that Itook but no longer remember most of them now. What I didlearn, in general, was that there were explanations and that the more I understood them, the more comfortable the world was to live in.

Please answer the following question: In my early 20s, I was a one-on-one aide for a couple of teenagers with cerebral palsy. With the first one, I was hired by and worked for the family. I picked the teen up from school every day and took care of him until he was in bed for the night. When he passed away, I took a job with the local school district. My client at the school had spastic quadriplegia. He could talk and was actually very smart, but he had no control over his arms or legs. He couldn’t walk. He was never going to walk. The law requires that special education students be put in the least restrictive classroom environment possible. Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn’t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes. His only accommodation was a one-on-one aide (me), and he was allowed to be late to classes without consequence because we sometimes had to stop in a special room, get him out of his chair, and stretch his legs a little. Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day. Anyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym). And, legally, his aide (me) had to accommodate his participation in every class as much as possible, including gym. Most gym classes began with the students doing laps around the track, then participating in a team sport. He couldn’t do the team sport, but, according to the lawyers involved, he should participate in the “laps around the track” part of gym. So I had to push this kid in a wheelchair around the track for about 15 minutes each day, until the other kids were all done and off doing the next activity. Then he and I were able to leave gym class and go do some physical therapy in his own little room just for that. Because, you know… lawyers and rules. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When did the author work as an aide to someone with spastic quadriplegia?
