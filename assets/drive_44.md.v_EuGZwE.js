This is the same principle that the sun's rays are considered to be parallel when they reach the Earth due to the vast distance to the sun compared to the Earth's size. When the rays are parallel like this, they will produce an illuminated region that creates a perfect hemispherical boundary. 5. **No Finite Point**: If the light source is at any finite distance, it won't produce an exactly half-illuminated sphere. The reason being, the rays will diverge or converge to a point, causing the area of illumination to be more than or less than half of the sphere as the source moves closer or farther (but still finite distance). 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, we determine that there is no specific finite location for a light source to illuminate exactly half of a sphere. The configuration falls into place effectively as we approach the limit where the distance tends to infinity. This effect ensures the illuminated portion equals the area of one hemisphere.

In detail: - We could draw 13 cards from each of three suits: (13 times 3 = 39) cards. - Additionally, the 2 joker cards can also be drawn. - Hence, we can draw a total of (39 + 2 = 41) cards without necessarily having 2 cards from the fourth suit. 5. **Ensuring the Solution**: - After drawing these 41 cards, every subsequent card drawn must contribute towards having 2 cards in each suit since we have already attained the maximum cards we can without achieving this condition. - We need to draw 2 more cards to guarantee that we get at least 2 cards of the fourth suit. 6. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, the total number of cards that need to be drawn to ensure that we have at least 2 cards of each suit in the worst-case scenario is: [ 41 + 2 = 43 ] The detailed derivation confirms that the answer to the problem is: [ boxed{43} ]"},{"prompt":"a rectangle PQRS, angle R is trisected by lines overline{RI} and overline{RJ}, where I is on overline{PQ}, and J is on overline{PS}.

To begin with, we will prove a lemma which will be useful later. # Lemma: Define a_k = frac{1}{k^2} + frac{1}{k^2 + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{(k+1)^2 - 1}. We claim that a_k > a_{k+1} for any positive integer k. Proof of Lemma: First observe that a_k consists of 2k+1 terms. Let's examine the sum of the first k terms and the last k+1 terms separately. - Sum of the first k terms is frac{1}{k^2} + frac{1}{k^2 + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{k^2 + k - 1}. Comparing this to frac{k}{k^2 + k - 1}, we note that frac{1}{k^2} + cdots + frac{1}{k^2 + k - 1} > frac{k}{k^2 + k - 1} > frac{k}{k^2 + k} = frac{1}{k + 1}. - Sum of the last k+1 terms is frac{1}{k^2 + k} + frac{1}{k^2 + k + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{(k+1)^2 - 1}. Comparing this to frac{k+1}{k^2 + 2k}, we note that frac{1}{k^2 + k} + cdots + frac{1}{(k+1)^2 - 1} < frac{k+1}{k^2 + k} < frac{1}{k}. From the above examinations, it follows that frac{1}{k + 1} < frac{1}{k^2} + frac{1}{k^2 + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{k^2 + k - 1} < frac{1}{k}, and similarly, frac{1}{k + 1} < frac{1}{k^2 + k} + frac{1}{k^2 + k + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{(k+1)^2 - 1} < frac{1}{k}. Adding the two inequalities: frac{2}{k + 1} < a_k < frac{2}{k}. Therefore, we have a_k > frac{2}{k + 1} > a_{k + 1}, proving the lemma. # Main Proof: Now, let us return to the original problem. Define S_n = frac{(-1)^{[sqrt{4}]}}{4} + frac{(-1)^{[sqrt{5}]}}{5} + cdots + frac{(-1)^{[sqrt{n}]}}{n}. For a positive integer m geq 2, let m^2 leq n < (m + 1)^2. Then [sqrt{n}] = m. Thus we can write S_n as: S_n = left(frac{1}{2^2} + frac{1}{2^2+1} + cdots + frac{1}{3^2-1}right) - left(frac{1}{3^2} + frac{1}{3^2+1} + cdots + frac{1}{4^2-1}right) + cdots + (-1)^{m-1} left(frac{1}{(m-1)^2} + cdots + frac{1}{m^2-1}right) + (-1)^m left(frac{1}{m^2} + cdots + frac{1}{n}right). Introduce: a_k = frac{1}{k^2} + frac{1}{k^2 + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{(k+1)^2 - 1}, quad k = 2, 3, ldots, m - 1, and a_m = frac{1}{m^2} + frac{1}{m^2 + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{n}, quad n leq (m+1)^2 - 1. Hence, we have: S_n = a_2 - a_3 + a_4 - cdots + (-1)^k a_k + (-1)^m a_m. Note that: a_m leq frac{1}{m^2} + frac{1}{m^2 + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{(m+1)^2 - 1} = a_{k+1}. From the lemma, we know that a_2 > a_3 > cdots > a_k > a_{k+1} geq a_m. When m is even: S_n = a_2 - (a_3 - a_4) - (a_5 - a_6) - cdots - (a_{m-1} - a_m) < a_2. When m is odd: S_n = a_2 - (a_3 - a_4) - (a_5 - a_6) - cdots - (a_{m-2} - a_{m-1}) - a_m < a_2. Hence, for any positive integer m geq 2, we get S_n < a_2. Finally, note that: a_2 = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{7} + frac{1}{8} < 1, thus S_n < 1. Similarly, S_n = a_2 - (a_3 - a_4 + a_5 - cdots + (-1)^m cdots) > a_2 - a_3 > 0.

Proof of (left(b - a_{0}right)^2 leq left(1 - lambda^2right)left(a - a_{0}right)^2): - Since ( f(a_{0}) = 0 ) and ( b = a - lambda f(a) ), we have: [ left(b - a_{0}right)^2 = left[a - a_{0} - lambda f(a)right]^2 = left[left(a - a_{0}right) - lambda(f(a) - f(a_{0}))right]^2. ] - Expanding the square term, we get: [ left[left(a - a_{0}right) - lambda(f(a) - f(a_{0}))right]^2 = left(a - a_{0}right)^2 - 2lambdaleft(a - a_{0}right)left[f(a) - f(a_{0})right] + lambda^2left[f(a) - f(a_{0})right]^2. ] - Using the inequalities [ left(a - a_{0}right)left[f(a) - f(a_{0})right] geq lambdaleft(a - a_{0}right)^2 geq 0 ] and [ left[f(a) - f(a_{0})right]^2 leq left(a - a_{0}right)^2, ] we substitute: [ left(b - a_{0}right)^2 leq left(a - a_{0}right)^2 - 2lambda^{2}left(a - a_{0}right)^2 + lambda^{2}left(a - a_{0}right)^2 = left(1 - lambda^{2}right)left(a - a_{0}right)^2. ] 4. Proof of ([f(b)]^2 leq left(1 - lambda^2right)[f(a)]^2): - From part (2), we get: [ [f(b)]^2 = left{[f(b) - f(a)] + left[f(a) - f(a_{0})right]right}^2. ] - Expanding the square: [ = [f(b) - f(a)]^2 + 2[f(b) - f(a)]left[f(a) - f(a_{0})right] + left[f(a) - f(a_{0})right]^2. ] - Using the second inequality and since ( left( b - a right) = -lambda f(a)), we have: [ [f(b) - f(a)]^2 leq (b - a)^2 - 2 frac{b - a}{lambda}[f(b) - f(a)] + [f(a)]^2 leq lambda^{2}[f(a)]^2 - frac{2}{lambda} cdot lambda(b - a)^2 + [f(a)]^2. ] - Simplifying: [ lambda^{2}[f(a)]^{2} - 2[lambda f(a)]^2 + [f(a)]^{2} = left(1 - lambda^2right)[f(a)]^2. ] Therefore, [ [f(b)]^2 leq left(1 - lambda^2right)[f(a)]^2. ] Conclusion: (boxed{text{All parts are proved.}})"},{"prompt":"William washes cars as a side job.

Time to wash one normal car = time for windows + time for body + time for tires + time for waxing Time for one normal car = 4 minutes + 7 minutes + 4 minutes + 9 minutes Time for one normal car = 24 minutes Now, let's calculate the total time William spent washing the two normal cars. Time for two normal cars = 2 * time for one normal car Time for two normal cars = 2 * 24 minutes Time for two normal cars = 48 minutes Since William spent 96 minutes washing all the vehicles, we can find the time he spent washing the big SUV by subtracting the time for the two normal cars from the total time. Time for big SUV = total time - time for two normal cars Time for big SUV = 96 minutes - 48 minutes Time for big SUV = 48 minutes Now, we have the time for the big SUV and the time for one normal car. To find the ratio of the time taken to wash the big SUV to the time taken to wash a normal car, we divide the time for the big SUV by the time for one normal car.

To find the number of bunnies, we subtract the number of dogs from the total number of dogs and bunnies: Number of bunnies = Total number of dogs and bunnies - Number of dogs Number of bunnies = 375 - 75 Number of bunnies = 300 Now we have the number of dogs (75) and the number of bunnies (300). The ratio of dogs to bunnies is: Dogs : Bunnies = 75 : 300 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 75 in this case: Dogs : Bunnies = 75/75 : 300/75 Dogs : Bunnies = 1 : 4 So the ratio of dogs to bunnies in stock is boxed{1:4} .

Let's go through this step-by-step: 1. **Assume Three Natural Numbers:** Let the three natural numbers be (a), (b), and (c). 2. **Pair Sums:** Given the condition, we have: [ a + b = 3^m quad (1) ] [ b + c = 3^n quad (2) ] [ c + a = 3^p quad (3) ] where (m), (n), and (p) are non-negative integers. 3. **Parity Argument:** Consider the parity (evenness or oddness) of the sums. 4. **Sum of Powers of Three:** Any power of three is an odd number. This is because: [ 3^0 = 1, quad 3^1 = 3, quad 3^2 = 9, quad text{etc.} ] All these numbers are odd. 5. **Analysis of the Parity:** - Since (a + b), (b + c), and (c + a) are all sums of two natural numbers and are powers of three, they must all be odd. - The sum of two odd numbers is always even. This creates a contradiction: - If (a) and (b) are both odd, then (a + b) is even. - If one of (a) or (b) is odd and the other is even, (a + b) would be odd. Therefore, among the three numbers (a), (b), and (c), at least two numbers must have the same parity (both even or both odd). - If both are odd, their sum is even, contradicting our condition that the sum is a power of three. - If both are even, their sum is even, again contradicting our condition that the sum is a power of three. 6. **Conclusion:** Since we have shown that there cannot exist three natural numbers such that the sum of any two of them is a power of three (due to the parity arguments), we conclude: [ boxed{text{No such numbers exist.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that F is the left focus of the hyperbola C: frac{x^2}{4} frac{y^2}{12} = 1, point A is (1,4), and P is a point on the right branch of C.

It can be inferred from the problem that when points A, P, and F' are collinear, the perimeter of triangle APF will be at its minimum. To find the equation of the line AP, which passes through points A and P, we know that since P lies on line AP and also on the hyperbola, P and F' are the same point when the perimeter is minimized. Therefore, P coincides with F'(4, 0). Thus, the slope of line AP passing through A(1, 4) and F'(4, 0) can be calculated using the slope formula: text{slope} = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = frac{0 - 4}{4 - 1} = frac{-4}{3}.

We will denote pairs as ( 1 rightarrow 3, 2 rightarrow 4 ). 2. **Pairs of Paths**: For every pair of paths ( 1 rightarrow 3, 2 rightarrow 4 ), there must be at least one common point (a branching point or a port).

Since r = u tan(alpha) = v tan(beta) = w tan(gamma) and u + v + w = frac{a + b + c}{2} = frac{p}{2} (where p is the perimeter), we rewrite the inequality we need to prove as: [ tan(angle A) + tan(angle B) + tan(angle C) geq frac{p}{2r} ] 4.

Let S_1 = cos(angle A) + cos(angle B) + cos(angle C) and S_2 = cos(angle A)^2 + cos(angle B)^2 + cos(angle C)^2, then: [ Delta = S_1^2 + S_2 - 2 S_1 ] 14. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: [ S_2 geq frac{S_1^2}{3} ] 15. Hence: [ Delta geq frac{2}{3} S_1 (2 S_1 - 3) ] 16.

We need to determine if the quadratic trinomials ( a) a^2 x^2 + b^2 x + c^2 ) and ( b) a^3 x^2 + b^3 x + c^3 ) necessarily have roots. Part (a): Quadratic Trinomial ( a^2 x^2 + b^2 x + c^2 ) 1. Consider the quadratic trinomial that indeed has roots, such as ( x^2 + x - 6 ). 2. The roots of ( x^2 + x - 6 ) can be found using the quadratic formula: [ x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ] For ( x^2 + x - 6 ), here ( a = 1 ), ( b = 1 ), and ( c = -6 ).

The discriminant for this trinomial is calculated as: [ Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 36 = 1 - 144 = -143 ] Since the discriminant is negative, this trinomial does not have real roots. Therefore, ( a^2 x^2 + b^2 x + c^2 ) does not necessarily have roots. Part (b): Quadratic Trinomial ( a^3 x^2 + b^3 x + c^3 ) 1. Since we know the original quadratic trinomial ( ax^2 + bx + c ) has roots, its discriminant is non-negative: [ b^2 - 4ac geq 0 ] 2. Consider the following scenarios based on the sign of ( ac ): **Scenario 1:** ( ac > 0 ) - We cube the inequality involving the discriminant: [ (b^2)^3 geq (4ac)^3 ] [ b^6 geq (4a^3c^3) ] - Since ( 64 > 4 ), it follows: [ b^6 geq b^2 cdot 4a^3c^3 > 4a^3c^3 ] - Thus, the discriminant of ( a^3 x^2 + b^3 x + c^3 ) is: [ b^6 - 4a^3c^3 > 0, ] ensuring it is non-negative, and thus this trinomial has real roots. **Scenario 2:** ( ac leq 0 ) - If ( ac leq 0 ), consider the inequality directly: [ b^2 geq 4ac ] Cubing both sides: [ b^6 geq (4ac)^3 text{ (since both sides are non-negative when (ac leq 0))} ] - Thus, in cases where (ac leq 0), the inequality ( b^6 geq 4a^3c^3 ) is trivially true.

Therefore, the number of such 3-element subsets ( A_i = {a_i, b_i, c_i} ) where ( b_i = k ) is: [ min {k - 1, n - k} ] 4. **Summing Over All Possible ( b_i ) Values**: To get the maximum number ( m ), sum this expression over all possible values of ( b_i ): [ m leq sum_{k = 2}^{n - 1} min {k - 1, n - k} ] 5. **Simplifying the Summation**: When evaluating the expression, it becomes evident that the summation has a symmetry around ( k = frac{n}{2} ). Therefore, the sum can be approximated by finding the maximum value and squaring it, divided by 4: [ m leq leftlfloor frac{(n - 1)^2}{4} rightrfloor ] 6. **Verification and Construction**: To verify, consider subsets ( {a, b, c} ) that satisfy ( a + c = 2b ). It ensures that for every middle element ( b ), there is a unique ( a ) and ( c ) such that ( a < b < c ). The number of such subsets is exactly: [ leftlfloor frac{(n - 1)^2}{4} rightrfloor ] # Conclusion: The maximum value of ( m ) is thus: [ boxed{leftlfloor frac{(n - 1)^2}{4} rightrfloor} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a circle with radius 8, two intersecting chords PQ and RS intersect at point T, where PQ is bisected by RS.

Given RS=10, let RT=TS=5. Since PQ is bisected, PT=TQ=x for some x. Since P is on the minor arc RS, the center O of the circle is within this minor arc's perpendicular bisector. The radius of the circle is 8, and we know from circle geometry that the perpendicular bisector of any chord passes through the center. Hence, OT is perpendicular to PQ. Since RS bisects PQ, OT is vertical and RS is horizontal. Consider triangle OPT. Using Pythagoras' theorem, the distance OT=sqrt{8^2-x^2}. Given the significance of PQ being the only chord bisected by RS, it follows that RS must be tangent to the smaller circle whose diameter is OP. The radius of this smaller circle is 4 (half of 8). Calculate PT knowing the tangent property. Let TQ=TP=x=5 (from tangency and bisecting property), hence OT=sqrt{8^2-5^2}=sqrt{39}. To find cos(angle POS), note angle POT is right. We evaluate cos(angle POT), which is also cos(angle POS): [ cos(angle POT) = frac{OT}{OP} = frac{sqrt{39}}{8} ] We need frac{m}{n} in reduced form. sqrt{39} is irrational, so express the fraction frac{sqrt{39}}{8}, reducing with m=sqrt{39}, n=8.

We need to show that ( f_n ) is well-defined. This means that if ( widehat{x} = widehat{y} ) in ( mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} ), then ( f_n(widehat{x}) = f_n(widehat{y}) ). 2. By definition, ( widehat{x} = widehat{y} ) implies ( x equiv y pmod{n} ), which means ( n mid (x - y) ). 3. We need to show that ( widehat{f(x)} = widehat{f(y)} ). This is equivalent to showing that ( f(x) equiv f(y) pmod{n} ). 4. Since ( f in mathbb{Z}[X] ), ( f(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. Therefore, ( f(x) - f(y) ) can be written as: [ f(x) - f(y) = a_k(x^k - y^k) + a_{k-1}(x^{k-1} - y^{k-1}) + cdots + a_1(x - y) ] 5. Each term ( x^i - y^i ) for ( i geq 1 ) is divisible by ( x - y ). Since ( n mid (x - y) ), it follows that ( n mid (x^i - y^i) ) for all ( i geq 1 ). 6. Therefore, ( n mid (f(x) - f(y)) ), which implies ( f(x) equiv f(y) pmod{n} ). 7. Hence, ( widehat{f(x)} = widehat{f(y)} ), and ( f_n(widehat{x}) = f_n(widehat{y}) ). This shows that ( f_n ) is well-defined. # Part (b) 1. We need to find all polynomials ( f in mathbb{Z}[X] ) such that for all ( n in mathbb{N} ), ( n geq 2 ), the function ( f_n ) is surjective. 2. Suppose ( deg(f) geq 2 ).

In ( mathbb{Z}/Mmathbb{Z} ), we have: [ f_M(widehat{0}) = widehat{f(0)} quad text{and} quad f_M(widehat{x_0}) = widehat{f(x_0)} ] 5. Since ( M = |f(x_0) - f(0)| ), we have ( widehat{f(x_0)} = widehat{f(0)} ) in ( mathbb{Z}/Mmathbb{Z} ). 6. This implies ( f_M(widehat{0}) = f_M(widehat{x_0}) ), but ( widehat{x_0} neq widehat{0} ) in ( mathbb{Z}/Mmathbb{Z} ). 7. Since ( mathbb{Z}/Mmathbb{Z} ) is finite, for ( f_M ) to be surjective, it must be injective. However, we have found ( widehat{0} neq widehat{x_0} ) such that ( f_M(widehat{0}) = f_M(widehat{x_0}) ), which is a contradiction. 8. Therefore, ( deg(f) leq 1 ). 9. Let ( f(X) = aX + b ). We need to check the conditions for ( f_n ) to be surjective. 10. If ( a = 0 ), then ( f(X) = b ), and ( f_n(widehat{x}) = widehat{b} ) for all ( widehat{x} in mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} ).

Hence, ( f(X) = pm X + b ) with ( b in mathbb{Z} ). 13.

From Equation 1, we can express a in terms of b: a = 1/2 * (b - 10) + 10 a = 1/2 * b - 5 + 10 a = 1/2 * b + 5 Now, we can substitute this expression for a into Equation 2: (1/2 * b + 5) + b = 35 1/2 * b + b = 35 - 5 1.5 * b = 30 b = 30 / 1.5 b = 20 Now that we have the value of b, we can find the value of a: a = 1/2 * b + 5 a = 1/2 * 20 + 5 a = 10 + 5 a = 15 So, A is 15 years old and B is 20 years old. The ratio of their present ages is a:b, which is 15:20.

A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. Therefore, either ( (3x + 2) = 1 ) or ( (5x - 14) = 1 ), or their negatives. 4.

To prove this, we construct such a sequence using recursion. Let's start with an initial sequence of ([0, 1]). Assume we have reached a part of the sequence containing (k) numbers, where every number occurs from (0) to ((n-1)! - 1). Moreover, for every (m leq (n-2)! - 1), there exists an (l < k) such that (l mid k) and the (i)-th and ((i + l))-th elements are congruent modulo (m). Now, to extend the sequence, we repeat the first (k) elements. For the next steps, for (0 < i leq 2k), we define: [ a_{i + 2k} = a_{i} + (n-1)! ] [ a_{i + 2cdot2k} = a_{i} + 2 cdot (n-1)! ] [ a_{i + (n-1)cdot2k} = a_{i} + (n-1) cdot (n-1)! ] Thus, for (k_2 = n cdot 2k), it also holds: 1.

This recursive construction ensures that every natural number will eventually be included in the sequence and will appear infinitely often. To guarantee that every number appears infinitely often, note that we are doubling the sequence every step. Therefore, if a number initially appears at least once (which every number does), then for any integer (alpha > 0), the number will appear (2^alpha) times, and hence infinitely often in subsequent duplications of the sequence.

First, find the derivative: y' = -frac{1}{2}x, Thus, the slope of the tangent line at point P is 2, therefore The equation of line l tangent to the parabola at point P(-4, -4) is y = 2x + 4, which intersects the x-axis at Q(-2, 0), therefore overrightarrow{PQ} = (2, 4), overrightarrow{QF} = (2, -1), therefore overrightarrow{PQ} cdot overrightarrow{QF} = 0, therefore overrightarrow{PQ} perp overrightarrow{QF}, Therefore, the center of the circumcircle of the triangle is the midpoint of PF, which is left(-2, -frac{5}{2}right), and the radius is frac{1}{2}PF = frac{1}{2} times 5 = frac{5}{2}, Thus, the equation of the circumcircle is left(x + 2right)^2 + left(y + frac{5}{2}right)^2 = left(frac{5}{2}right)^2, Which simplifies to x^2 + y^2 + 4x + 5y + 4 = 0.

The fact that triangles ( B A_1 C ), ( C B_1 A ), and ( A C_1 B ) are similar implies that: [ a_1 = b + (c - b) z, quad b_1 = c + (a - c) z, quad c_1 = a + (b - a) z ] for some complex number ( z ). 2.

Since three smaller circles fit exactly along the diameter of the larger circle, their combined diameter (which is three times the diameter of one smaller circle) equals the diameter of the larger circle. 2. Therefore, the diameter of the larger circle is 2 times 10 meters = 20 meters (since the diameter is twice the radius). 3. Thus, the diameter of one smaller circle is frac{20}{3} meters. 4.

Moreover, we want to demonstrate that these two figures can be made to coincide using a parallel translation. 2. **Definitions and properties:** The symmetry operation relative to a plane means that every point in ( boldsymbol{F}'' ) is the mirror image of the corresponding point in ( boldsymbol{F} ) relative to the plane ( alpha ). Therefore, if ( P ) is a point in ( boldsymbol{F} ), then its corresponding point ( P'' ) in ( boldsymbol{F}'' ) satisfies: [ d(P, alpha) = d(P'', alpha) ] Here, ( d(P, alpha) ) denotes the distance from point ( P ) to the plane ( alpha ). 3. **Constructing the second symmetric figure:** Now, consider another plane ( alpha' ) which is parallel to ( alpha ).

Due to the properties of symmetry across parallel planes, the distance between corresponding points in ( boldsymbol{F}'' ) and ( boldsymbol{F}''' ) will be preserved. 6. **Parallel translation:** Since ( alpha ) and ( alpha' ) are parallel, it means the relative positioning of the points in ( boldsymbol{F}'' ) and ( boldsymbol{F}''' ) reflects that of ( boldsymbol{F} ) to ( alpha ).

Specifically, in a circle, [ angle BXA = frac{1}{2} angle BAC ] 4. **Construction of Point (A_1)**: - Construct the image (A_1) of point (A) by translating (A) along line (CD) by a distance equal to (a). 5. **Arc and Chord Relationship**: - Now, on the segment (A_1B), which is part of the circle, construct a circular arc in the plane containing chord (CD). This arc must subtend an angle (frac{1}{2} angle BAC). 6. **Intersection Point (X)**: - If this arc intersects chord (CD), every intersection point is a candidate for the desired point (X). # Conclusion: The point (X) is then found as the intersection of the constructed arc with the chord (CD). Thus, we have constructed the point (X) such that chords (AX) and (BX) cut off the segment (EF) of the given length (a) on chord (CD).

Then ( x times 2x = 18 ), hence ( 2x^2 = 18 ) giving us ( x^2 = 9 ) and ( x = 3 ). 2. **Establish the dimensions of the rectangle**: - From the above, the dimensions of the rectangle are ( 3 ) (shorter side) and ( 6 ) (longer side). 3. **Setup relationship and apply the Pythagorean theorem**: - Each vertex of the square splits a side of the rectangle, hence ( a + b = 3 ) (since it divides the shorter side). - The square is inscribed, meaning it touches all four sides of the rectangle. Analyzing the geometry, the diagonal ( d ) of the square (which is ( 3sqrt{2} )) splits into the most extreme positions of the squares vertices along the 6 length side of the rectangle. - Calculate ( ab ) based on the relations and given data: From ( a + b = 3 ), and geometric placement, we have the right triangle with sides ( a, b, ) and hypotenuse ( 3 ). Thus, ( a^2 + b^2 = 9 ). 4. **Finding ( ab )**: - From previous setups, ((a+b)^2 = 9 ) gives us ( a^2 + b^2 + 2ab = 9 ). - Knowing ( a^2 + b^2 = 9 ) and substituting, we get [ 9 + 2ab = 9 ] [ 2ab = 0 ] [ ab = 0 ] We find ( ab = 0 ).

Let's denote the tetrahedron (triangular pyramid) as DABC and assume that the face ABC has the largest area, denoted by S = text{Area}(ABC). 2. Consider a plane parallel to ABC that intersects the tetrahedron DABC at points A_1, B_1, C_1. The intersection A_1B_1C_1 forms a triangle that is similar to triangle ABC. 3. The similarity ratio between triangle A_1B_1C_1 and triangle ABC must be less than 1 because A_1B_1C_1 is contained within the tetrahedron, making triangle A_1B_1C_1 a smaller, scaled-down version of triangle ABC. 4. In similar triangles, the area of the smaller triangle is the square of the ratio of similarity times the area of the larger triangle. If the similarity ratio is r (where 0 < r < 1), then: [ text{Area}(A_1B_1C_1) = r^2 cdot text{Area}(ABC) = r^2 cdot S ] 5. Since 0 < r < 1, it follows that r^2 < 1, and hence: [ text{Area}(A_1B_1C_1) = r^2 cdot S < S ] This means the area of any triangle A_1B_1C_1, formed as a section of the tetrahedron DABC by a plane parallel to ABC, is always less than the area S of the face ABC. 6. Any other plane intersecting the tetrahedron that is not parallel to ABC will form a section with an even smaller area because the intersection will create a quadrilateral or polygons other than triangles. These other sections can similarly be compared, showing their areas are constrained to be below the maximum area, S. **Conclusion:** We have demonstrated that the area of any section of the tetrahedron DABC cannot surpass the area of the largest face, which is triangle ABC.

Since f(x) and g(x) are quadratic trinomials, without loss of generality, let: [ h(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ] 2. **Analyze the Integer Parts Equality:** Given the equality of the integer parts, we know that: [ [f(x)] = [g(x)] implies [h(x) + g(x)] = [g(x)] ] This implies: [ |h(x)| = |f(x) - g(x)| leq 1 ] 3. **Quadratic Function Behavior:** A quadratic function h(x) can take arbitrarily large or small values as |x| to infty, unless it is a constant function. Therefore, for the inequality ( |h(x)| leq 1 ) to hold for all x, h(x) must not be a true quadratic function and the coefficient a of x^2 must be zero: [ a = 0 ] 4. **Reduce ( h(x) ) to a Linear Function:** Removing the quadratic term, we have: [ h(x) = b x + c ] 5. **Evaluate the Linear Term:** For h(x) = b x + c to satisfy ( |h(x)| leq 1 ) for all x, consider the case where b neq 0. For large values of x, |b x + c| would exceed 1, violating the condition. Thus, the coefficient b must also be zero: [ b = 0 ] 6. **Constant Function Verification:** Now, ( h(x) = c ). Hence, we have: [ |c| leq 1 ] 7. **Consequence for ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ):** If c = 0, it immediately follows that h(x) = 0. Therefore: [ f(x) = g(x) ] 8. **Verification if ( c neq 0 ):** Suppose c neq 0. Assume c > 0 (without loss of generality since changing f and g places would negate c). Consider an integer n which is a value of the polynomial f(x) at some point x_0. Then: [ f(x_0) = n ] Consequently: [ g(x_0) = f(x_0) - c = n - c ] Since 0 < c leq 1, it implies: [ g(x_0) < f(x_0) ] Hence: [ [g(x_0)] < [f(x_0)] ] This contradicts the initial condition that [f(x)] = [g(x)] for all x.

Similarly, with the maximum value of a being 9, the minimum value of b being 0, and the maximum value of c being 9, we find that a - b + c < 18. Therefore, -8 < a - b + c < 18. To make a - b + c divisible by 11, its value can only be 0 or 11. 1. When a - b + c = 0, we get 9a + b = a^2 + b^2 + c^2.

Now, considering that the inclination angle alpha of a line is within the range of [0, pi) (or 0^circ to 180^circ non-inclusive, based on the convention for inclination angles of lines), we must find the values of alpha that satisfy the inequality for the tangent function. The tangent function has a range of [-infty, infty], but it is only within [-1, 1] in four intervals within the range of alpha: 1. The first quadrant, where 0 leq alpha < frac{pi}{2}, 2.

Considering the period and symmetry of the tangent function, and that the tangent is zero at 0 and frac{pi}{2}, we can see that the tangent will be between -1 and 1 for: 1. alpha in [0, frac{pi}{4}] for the first quadrant, because tan(alpha) increases from 0 to 1. 2. alpha in [frac{3pi}{4}, pi) for the second quadrant, because tan(alpha) increases from -1 to 0.

Consider a board with ( k+1 ) columns. - Apply the Lemma to the first column to make all its cells 1. - Decrease each cell in the first column by 1 to make them all 0. - Now, ignore the first column and apply the induction hypothesis to the remaining ( k ) columns. - This completes the proof that we can make all cells in the board 0.

Let's break this problem into parts. Step 1: Calculating the Total Distance with Maximum Jumps If the kangaroo jumps 30 times with both legs, each jump would cover 7 meters. The total distance covered would be: [ 30 times 7 = 210 text{ meters} ] However, 210 meters exceeds the required 200 meters by 10 meters. So, adjustments are needed. Step 2: Adjustments to Decrease the Distance We know we need to reduce the distance by 10 meters.

Firstly, given that a line passes through F_1 and is perpendicular to the x-axis intersecting the ellipse at points B and C, we know that BC is equal to the minor axis length, 2b. Since angle BF_2C = 90°, triangle BF_2C is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at F_2. The distance BF_1 is equal to half the distance of the minor axis (since it lies along the line perpendicular to the x-axis which passes through F_1), which can be written as BF_1 = frac{b^2}{a}. The length of the major axis is 2a, and the distance between the foci is 2c. By the properties of an ellipse, the distance 2c is equal to the height of the right-angled triangle BF_2C (BF_1 in our case), hence we have 2c = frac{b^2}{a}. Now, we use the relationship of the ellipse that c^2 = a^2 - b^2. Substituting 2c = frac{b^2}{a}, we get 4c^2 = frac{b^4}{a^2}, hence 4(a^2 - b^2) = frac{b^4}{a^2}. This gives us 4a^4 - 4a^2b^2 = b^4. We now let e be the eccentricity of the ellipse. The eccentricity e is defined by e = frac{c}{a}. From the relationship c^2 = a^2 - b^2, we can write e^2 = frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2} or e^2 = 1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}. Multiplying by a^2 gives a^2e^2 = a^2 - b^2. Plugging the expression for 2c = frac{b^2}{a} in terms of the eccentricity e, we get 4e^2a^2 = frac{b^4}{a^2}, or a^4e^2 = frac{b^4}{4}. This implies b^2 = a^2sqrt{e}. Substitute b^2 back into the expression for the eccentricity, we get e^2 = 1 - frac{a^2sqrt{e}}{a^2}, which simplifies to e^2 = 1 - sqrt{e}. Solving this quadratic equation for e considering 0 < e < 1 (since it's an eccentricity of an ellipse, which is always between 0 and 1): Let's rearrange the equation: e^2 + sqrt{e} - 1 = 0 Substituting u = sqrt{e}, we get u^4 + u - 1 = 0. Solving this equation for u, we can see that one of the positive solutions is u = sqrt{2} - 1. Hence, e = left(sqrt{2} - 1right)^2.

Points (M) and (N) lie on the bisectors (or their extensions) such that (MA = ML) and (NA = NL). We need to find (angle MAN). 1. **Properties of Bisectors:** - If a bisector (BK) in triangle (ABC) intersects the circumcircle at point (W): - (AW = CW) because (angle CAW = angle CBW = angle ABW = angle ACW). Hence, (AWC) is isosceles. - (W) lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment (AC). 2. **Analyzing Triangle (ABL):** - Consider triangle (ABL) with (BL) being a bisector. By definition, (M) is on the bisector of (angle BAC) and hence (A), (C), (L), and (M) lie on a circle. - Similarly, (N) is on the bisector of (angle BAC) and hence (A), (B), (L), and (N) also lie on a circle. 3. **Angle Calculation:** - Points (A), (C), (L), and (M) being concyclic imply that (angle text{LAM} = angle text{LCM}). - Similarly, points (A), (B), (L), and (N) being concyclic imply that (angle text{LAN} = angle text{NBL}). - Since (MAL) and (NAL) form angles at circumcircle and opposite sides: [ angle MAL + angle LAN = angle LCM + angle NBL ] Hence, we get: [ angle MAN = angle LAM + angle LAN ] 4. **Summarizing Angular Measure:** - Using the properties of bisectors in a triangle: [ angle LAM + angle LAN = frac{angle C}{2} + frac{angle B}{2} ] We know (angle C + angle B = 180^circ - angle A = 180^circ - 50^circ), thus: [ angle LAM + angle LAN = frac{180^circ - 50^circ}{2} = 65^circ ] Thus, the measure of (angle MAN) is: [ boxed{65^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that a, b in mathbb{R}, the function f(x) = ax^2 + ln x + b has a tangent line equation at the point (1, f(1)) of 4x + 4y + 1 = 0. 1.

For ( a geq 2 ), consider ordered pairs ( (i, a) ) with ( i < a ) and ( gcd(a, i) = 1 ). Each pair appears exactly once in the sequence. - By symmetry, each ordered pair ( (a, i) ) appears exactly once. - If ( (a, i) ) appears in ( s_j ), then ( (a, i + ka) ) appears in ( s_{j+k} ). 4. **Counting Appearances:** - For ( n geq 2 ), consider all numbers ( x ) less than and coprime with ( n ). - For each such ( x ), there is exactly one ordered pair ( (n, y) ) in ( s_n ) with ( x equiv y pmod{n} ). - Therefore, there are exactly ( phi(n) ) such pairs in ( s_n ), where ( phi ) is Euler's totient function.

The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. Therefore, the total number of ways to select 4 products from 100 is given by C_{100}^{4} = dfrac{100!}{4!(100-4)!}. 2. **Number of ways to select exactly one second-class product**: To have exactly one second-class product, we select 1 out of the 10 second-class products and 3 out of the 90 first-class products. The number of ways to select 1 second-class product is C_{10}^{1} = dfrac{10!}{1!(10-1)!}, and the number of ways to select 3 first-class products is C_{90}^{3} = dfrac{90!}{3!(90-3)!}.

In this case, the favorable outcomes are the number of ways to select exactly one second-class product, and the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of ways to select 4 products from 100. Therefore, the probability is given by dfrac{C_{10}^{1}C_{90}^{3}}{C_{100}^{4}}. Putting it all together, the probability that exactly one of the 4 products selected is a second-class product is dfrac{C_{10}^{1}C_{90}^{3}}{C_{100}^{4}}.

Since ( y^2 ) is a perfect square, ( v_p(y^2) ) is even, say ( v_p(y^2) = 2j ). 7. Thus, ( p^{i+1} mid y^2 ) because ( i ) is odd and ( i+1 ) is even. 8. Since ( p mid y ), we have ( p^{i+1} mid xy ). 9. Therefore, ( p^{i+1} mid x^{2022} + x + y^2 ). 10. Since ( p^{i+1} mid x^{2022} ) and ( p^{i+1} mid y^2 ), it follows that ( p^{i+1} mid x ). 11.

If there were no dogs with missing legs, the total number of dog legs would be 109 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 436 legs. - Cats: Normally, cats have 4 legs. If there were no cats with missing legs, the total number of cat legs would be 37 cats * 4 legs/cat = 148 legs. - Birds: Normally, birds have 2 legs.

We need to determine how many cycles are required to at least triple our cocos (since initially exchanging 100 dollars would net 1000 cocos, and we need 3000 cocos to ensure we get at least 200 dollars back): [ left(frac{12}{11}right)^n > 3 ] Taking logarithms on both sides, [ n log left(frac{12}{11}right) > log3 quad Rightarrow quad n > frac{log3}{log left(frac{12}{11}right)} ] Using logarithm properties and approximate values, [ log3 approx 0.477 quad text{and} quad log left(frac{12}{11}right) approx 0.0414 ] [ n > frac{0.477}{0.0414} approx 11.52 ] Thus, ( n ), the required number of cycles to increase the cocos by a factor of 3, is approximately 12. 4.

Let ( a ) represent the number of candies eaten by one child, say Petya. 2. **Understanding the Given Conditions**: According to the problem, each child eats 7 candies less than the total eaten by the other children combined. Mathematically, we express this as follows: [ a = S - a - 7 ] Simplifying this equation, we get: [ a + a = S - 7 ] [ 2a = S - 7 ] So, [ S = 2a + 7 ] 3. **Finding ( a ) in terms of ( N )**: Each child consumes the same number of candies, ( a ).

What is the probability that it is possible to go from the first floor to the last floor, passing through only open doors?","completion":"1. **Define the Problem:** We have ( n ) floors and two staircases in a building. Between each pair of successive floors, there are two doors (one on each staircase) connecting the floors. These doors can either be open or closed. 2. **Numbering the Doors:** Let’s denote the doors between floor (k) and floor (k+1) as the doors of level ( k ) where ( k = 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ). 3. **Conditions for Passability:** In order to pass from the first floor to the last floor through only open doors, ensure there is at least one open door at every level ( k ). 4. **Critical Reasoning:** If both doors on the same level ( k ) are closed, it is impossible to move between floor ( k ) and floor ( k+1 ), thus blocking the path entirely from the first to the last floor. 5. **Event ( A ):** Let event ( A ) be defined as the event where it is possible to reach the last floor from the first floor. For event ( A ) to happen, no level should have both doors closed simultaneously. 6. **Total Number of Possible Ways to Close Doors:** The total number of doors between floors is ( 2(n-1) ). Since the commandant closes exactly half of the doors, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose ( (n-1) ) doors to be closed from ( 2(n-1) ) doors. This can be computed using the binomial coefficient: [ C_{2(n-1)}^{n-1} ] 7. **Number of Favorable Combinations:** For event ( A ) to happen, at each level ( k ), either at least one door is open. Each level has 3 favorable combinations for door states: 1. The left door is open, right door closed. 2. The left door is closed, right door open. 3. Both doors are open (since only half doors closed on total levels). Thus, because one door will not be closed, each level ( k ) still maintains two options per level when ( n-1 ) doors are closed. Hence, the total number of favorable combinations for ( n-1 ) levels is: [ 2^{n-1} ] 8. **Probability Computation:** The probability of event ( A ) is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes: [ mathrm{P}(A) = frac{2^{n-1}}{C_{2(n-1)}^{n-1}} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{2^{n-1}}{C_{2(n-1)}^{n-1}}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let i be the imaginary unit, then the real and imaginary parts of the complex number z=i^2+i are ( ) A: 1, i B: 1, 1 C: 1, i D: 1, 1","completion":"Since z=i^2+i=-1+i, the real and imaginary parts of the complex number z=i^2+i are -1 and 1 respectively.

The speeds of A and B can be calculated as follows: Speed of A (S_A) = Total distance / Time taken by A S_A = 1000 meters / 615 seconds Now, we need to find the time taken by B to complete the 1000 meters. We know that B has run 984 meters in the same time A has run 1000 meters. Let's use the ratio of the distances to find the time taken by B to run 1000 meters: (984 meters / 1000 meters) = (615 seconds / T_B) Now, we solve for T_B: T_B = (1000 meters * 615 seconds) / 984 meters T_B = 615000 / 984 T_B = 625 seconds (approximately, since 615000 / 984 is not a whole number) Now we can find the difference in time between A and B: Difference in time = T_B - Time taken by A Difference in time = 625 seconds - 615 seconds Difference in time = 10 seconds Therefore, A beats B by approximately boxed{10} seconds."},{"prompt":"The diagonals of a rhombus are 12 inches and 16 inches.

Let p(x)= frac {1-ln x}{x}, and p'(x)= frac {ln x-2}{x^{2}}. When x > e^{2}, p'(x) > 0; when 0 < x < e^{2}, p'(x) < 0. Thus, p(x) decreases on (0,e^{2}) and increases on (e^{2},+infty). Therefore, p_{min}(x)=p(e^{2})=- frac {1}{e^{2}}. When aleqslant - frac {1}{e^{2}}, aleqslant frac {1-ln x}{x}, meaning e^{ax-1}- frac {1}{x}leqslant 0. On (0,- frac {1}{a}), ax+1 > 0, g'(x)leqslant 0, g(x) decreases; On (- frac {1}{a},+infty), ax+1 < 0, g'(x)geqslant 0, g(x) increases. Therefore, g_{min}(x)=g(- frac {1}{a})=varphi(a).

Now we need to find the first term a_1 of the sequence. We can use the fact that a_2 = a_1 cdot q: 2 = a_1 cdot 2. Solving for a_1 gives us a_1 = frac{2}{2} = 1.

These points are known to be in such a position that no three points are collinear. Define two sets ( L ) and ( R ) as follows: [ begin{array}{l} L = {A_1, A_3, ldots, A_{2n-1}}, R = {A_2, A_4, ldots, A_{2n}}. end{array} ] Each of these sets ( L ) and ( R ) contains ( n ) points. 2. **Rotation of Line Segment**: Choose an initial line segment ( s = A_{2n}A_1 ). Rotate this line segment about point ( A_1 ) so that it passes through ( A_2 ). The direction of this rotation (say, counterclockwise) should be such that ( s ) always rotates in one specific direction, either completely counterclockwise or completely clockwise, until it lines up through point ( A_2 ).

The total sum of all oriented angles of these rotations, denoted as theta, must equal multiple of 180^circ. Each rotation does not make ( s ) parallel to the initial division line ( l ), implying the total sum of rotations adds up to zero ((theta = 0)). This is because the angles cumulatively return the segment to its original alignment, thus forming a complete rotation not contributing any net-scale angle. 5. **Grouping of Angles**: Consequently, we can group these (2n) inwardly formed angles into two sets: - One set composed of angles formed in the counterclockwise direction. - The other composed of angles in the clockwise direction.

Let ( mathbf{A}, mathbf{B}, mathbf{C}, mathbf{D} ) be the position vectors of points ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ) respectively. # Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Express Midpoints in Vector Form:** [ mathbf{M} = frac{mathbf{A} + mathbf{B}}{2} ] [ mathbf{N} = frac{mathbf{C} + mathbf{D}}{2} ] 2. **Vector ( mathbf{MN} ):** [ mathbf{MN} = mathbf{N} - mathbf{M} = frac{mathbf{C} + mathbf{D}}{2} - frac{mathbf{A} + mathbf{B}}{2} = frac{(mathbf{C} + mathbf{D}) - (mathbf{A} + mathbf{B})}{2} = frac{mathbf{C} + mathbf{D} - mathbf{A} - mathbf{B}}{2} ] 3. **Conditions for Perpendicularity:** ( mathbf{MN} ) is perpendicular to ( mathbf{AB} ) if: [ mathbf{MN} cdot (mathbf{A} - mathbf{B}) = 0 ] Similarly, ( mathbf{MN} ) is perpendicular to ( mathbf{CD} ) if: [ mathbf{MN} cdot (mathbf{C} - mathbf{D}) = 0 ] 4. **Dot Product Condition for Perpendicularity:** Substituting ( mathbf{MN} ) in the dot product equations, we get: [ left( frac{mathbf{C} + mathbf{D} - mathbf{A} - mathbf{B}}{2} right) cdot (mathbf{A} - mathbf{B}) = 0 ] [ (mathbf{C} + mathbf{D} - mathbf{A} - mathbf{B}) cdot (mathbf{A} - mathbf{B}) = 0 ] Similarly, [ left( frac{mathbf{C} + mathbf{D} - mathbf{A} - mathbf{B}}{2} right) cdot (mathbf{C} - mathbf{D}) = 0 ] [ (mathbf{C} + mathbf{D} - mathbf{A} - mathbf{B}) cdot (mathbf{C} - mathbf{D}) = 0 ] 5. **Expanding the Dot Products:** Expanding and simplifying both dot product equations: [ (mathbf{C} + mathbf{D} - mathbf{A} - mathbf{B}) cdot (mathbf{A} - mathbf{B}) = 0 ] [ mathbf{C} cdot (mathbf{A} - mathbf{B}) + mathbf{D} cdot (mathbf{A} - mathbf{B}) - mathbf{A} cdot (mathbf{A} - mathbf{B}) - mathbf{B} cdot (mathbf{A} - mathbf{B}) = 0 ] Similarly, [ (mathbf{C} + mathbf{D} - mathbf{A} - mathbf{B}) cdot (mathbf{C} - mathbf{D}) = 0 ] [ mathbf{C} cdot (mathbf{C} - mathbf{D}) + mathbf{D} cdot (mathbf{C} - mathbf{D}) - mathbf{A} cdot (mathbf{C} - mathbf{D}) - mathbf{B} cdot (mathbf{C} - mathbf{D}) = 0 ] 6. **Simplification and Combining Results:** The above equations can be simplified and combined as: Adding the two equations, we get: [ (mathbf{A} - mathbf{D})^2 = (mathbf{B} - mathbf{C})^2 Rightarrow AD = BC ] Subtracting the two equations, we get: [ (mathbf{A} - mathbf{C})^2 = (mathbf{B} - mathbf{D})^2 Rightarrow AC = BD ] 7. **Conversely:** Given ( AD = BC ) and ( AC = BD ), we can reverse the above logic to show that: [ (mathbf{A} - mathbf{D})^2 = (mathbf{B} - mathbf{C})^2 ] [ (mathbf{A} - mathbf{C})^2 = (mathbf{B} - mathbf{D})^2 ] Adding these gives ( (mathbf{A} + mathbf{B} - mathbf{C} + mathbf{D}) cdot (mathbf{A} - mathbf{B}) = 0 ). Hence, ( mathbf{MN} ) is perpendicular to ( mathbf{AB} ). Subtracting these gives ( (mathbf{A} + mathbf{B} - mathbf{C} + mathbf{D}) cdot (mathbf{C} - mathbf{D}) = 0 ). Hence, ( mathbf{MN} ) is perpendicular to ( mathbf{CD} ). # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that ( MN ) is perpendicular to ( AB ) and ( CD ) if and only if ( AC = BD ) and ( AD = BC ).

Since (5^9) is a large power of 5, we can consider the inverse of 6 modulo 5: [ 6 equiv 1 pmod{5} ] Thus, the inverse of 6 modulo 5 is 1. 8. Therefore, we need (a_9) such that: [ a_9 cdot 5^9 equiv 1 pmod{5^{10}} ] 9. Since (a_9) must be an integer between 0 and 4, we test each value: - For (a_9 = 0): [ 0 cdot 5^9 equiv 0 pmod{5^{10}} ] - For (a_9 = 1): [ 1 cdot 5^9 equiv 5^9 pmod{5^{10}} ] - For (a_9 = 2): [ 2 cdot 5^9 equiv 2 cdot 5^9 pmod{5^{10}} ] - For (a_9 = 3): [ 3 cdot 5^9 equiv 3 cdot 5^9 pmod{5^{10}} ] - For (a_9 = 4): [ 4 cdot 5^9 equiv 4 cdot 5^9 pmod{5^{10}} ] 10.

The cosine theorem is described as follows: In triangle triangle ABC, with angles angle A, angle B, and angle C opposite sides a, b, and c respectively, then the square of any side of the triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides minus twice the product of those two sides and the cosine of the angle between them.

Both (m - n) and (m + n) must be integers of the same parity because adding or subtracting two integers of the same parity always results in an even number.

Considering the quadratic residues modulo 4: [ 0^2 equiv 0 pmod{4} quad text{and} quad 1^2 equiv 1 pmod{4} ] Therefore, m^2 and n^2 can only be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4.

For a prime number ( p ), we know: [ (p-1)! text{ does not include the factor } p. ] Therefore, ((p-1)!) cannot be divisible by ( p^2 ) since ( p^2 ) requires at least two factors of ( p ), but ((p-1)!) has none. 2. **Specific Case ( n=9 ):** Calculate: [ 8! = 1 times 2 times 3 times 4 times 5 times 6 times 7 times 8 ] We can see that ( 9 mid 8! ) (since ( 3^2 = 9 mid 720 (8!) )), but: [ 9^2 = 81 notmid 8! ] Hence, ((n-1)!) cannot be divisible by ( n^2 ) for ( n=9 ). 3. **Composite Number Condition:** Now, let us consider the case where ( n ) is an odd composite number, different from 9. Consider an odd composite number in the form of ( n = a times b ) where ( a, b geq 3 ). - If ( a ) and ( b ) are at least 3, then the product ( a times b leq frac{(n-1)!}{a^2 b^2} ). - Consider: [ a, 2a, b, 2b text{ are all factors of }(n-1)! ] This ensures ( (n-1)! ) includes ( a^2 b^2 = n^2 ).

Maximum Number of Coins: To maximize the number of coins, Paul should use the coin with the lowest value, which is the 1-cent coin. 1. **Using 1-cent coins**: To make up 50 cents using 1-cent coins, he would need 50 coins. Thus, the maximum number of coins Paul can use is 50 coins. Difference Between Maximum and Minimum: The difference between the largest and the smallest number of coins Paul can use is 50 - 3 = 47 coins.

Thus, ( L(x) ) is a linear polynomial that interpolates the given points. 4. **General Form of ( P(x) )**: Since ( L(x) ) is a linear polynomial, we can express ( P(x) ) as: [ P(x) = L(x) + Q(x) prod_{k=1}^{10} (x - m_k) ] where ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. Given that ( deg P leq 10 ), ( Q(x) ) must be a constant polynomial (possibly zero), i.e., ( Q(x) equiv c ). 5. **Condition on ( P(10) - P(0) )**: We are given that ( |P(10) - P(0)| < 1000 ). Substituting ( P(x) = varepsilon(x - m_1) + 1 + c prod_{k=1}^{10} (x - m_k) ), we get: [ P(10) - P(0) = varepsilon(10 - m_1) + 1 + c left( prod_{k=1}^{10} (10 - m_k) - prod_{k=1}^{10} (-m_k) right) ] Simplifying, we have: [ P(10) - P(0) = 10varepsilon + c left( prod_{k=1}^{10} (10 - m_k) - prod_{k=1}^{10} m_k right) ] 6. **Magnitude of ( P(10) - P(0) )**: If ( c neq 0 ), the term ( c left( prod_{k=1}^{10} (10 - m_k) - prod_{k=1}^{10} m_k right) ) would be very large because the product of 10 distinct integers (ranging from 1 to 10) is ( 10! ). Thus: [ |P(10) - P(0)| geq 10! - 10 > 1000 ] This contradicts the given condition ( |P(10) - P(0)| < 1000 ). Therefore, ( c ) must be zero. 7. **Conclusion**: Hence, ( P(x) = L(x) = varepsilon(x - m_1) + 1 ), which is a linear polynomial. This means ( P(x) = pm x + C ) for some constant ( C ). 8. **Final Proof**: Since ( P(x) = pm x + C ) is a linear polynomial, for any integer ( k ), we can always find an integer ( m ) such that ( P(m) = k ). This completes the proof. (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth basketball games of the season, a player scored 21, 15, 12, and 19 points, respectively.

From the given equation, we can manipulate it as follows: - Start with the given equation: asin A - csin C = (a-b)sin B - Apply the Law of Sines to relate sides and angles: a^2 - c^2 = (a-b)b = ab - b^2 - Rearrange to form a recognizable trigonometric identity: a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = ab From the above, we can deduce the cosine of angle C using the cosine rule, where cos C = frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}: cos C = frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} = frac{1}{2} Given that C is in the interval (0, pi), we can determine that: C = frac{pi}{3} Therefore, the measure of angle C is boxed{frac{pi}{3}}.

We aim to prove that CF = FG. 1. **Label Points of Tangency**: Let the incircle be tangent to AB at point P and to AC at point Q. 2. **Desargues' Theorem Application (Involution)**: Consider the intersection of lines PQ and BC denoted as point K. According to Desargues' theorem, E and K divide BC harmonically. 3. **Harmonic Conjugates**: Point D on AE divides AE harmonically. Therefore, D is the pole of BC with respect to the incircle. This means points B, D, E, C form a harmonic bundle. 4. **Transversal through Pole**: Extend lines DB and DC which confirms that DE and DK must also form a harmonic division. 5. **Parallel Lines**: From corresponding angles and the given configuration, angle KDE = angle AEK = angle EFC. This shows that line MK is parallel to line CG, where M and N are points on AB and AC where the tangents from D to AB and AC meet, respectively. 6. **Equal Segments Conclusion**: Given that DK is a harmonic separator and DE parallel CG, it implies that CF = FG.

Circle C_{1} is given by {x}^{2}+{y}^{2}-2x-4y+4=0. Completing the squares for x and y terms gives us: - Center (h, k) = (1, 2). - Radius r = sqrt{h^2 + k^2 - 4} = sqrt{1 + 4 - 4} = 1. - **Step 2:** Calculate the distance d from the center of the circle to the line l. The distance formula is d = frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + c|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}, where line l is ax + by + c = 0 and (x_0, y_0) is the point (1, 2). For line l: x + 2y - 4 = 0, we have: d = frac{|1 + 4 - 4|}{sqrt{1^2 + 2^2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{5}} = frac{sqrt{5}}{5}. - **Step 3:** Use the formula for the length of chord AB intersecting a circle. The length of chord AB is given by |AB| = 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2}. Substituting r = 1 and d = frac{sqrt{5}}{5}, we get: |AB| = 2sqrt{1 - left(frac{1}{5}right)} = 2sqrt{frac{4}{5}} = frac{4sqrt{5}}{5}.

We get left(D+2right)x+left(E+4right)y+F-4=0. - **Step 3:** Since the common chord is parallel to 2x + y + 1 = 0, the coefficients of x and y must be proportional, leading to: frac{D+2}{2} = frac{E+4}{1} implies D = 2E + 6. - **Step 4:** Use the points E(1, -3) and F(0, 4) to set up and solve a system of equations with the assumed equation of C_{2}. Substituting these points gives us two equations: 1. 1 + 9 + D - 3E + F = 0. 2. 16 + 4E + F = 0.

At each station, the train can deliver 1 wood car, so after 4 stations, it will have delivered 4 wood cars.

This is because for each spin, there are 5 possible outcomes, and the spins are independent of each other. Therefore, the total number of possibilities is 5 cdot 5 cdot 5 = 125. 2. **Identify the Desired Outcome**: To earn exactly 1700, you must land on the 300, 400, and 1000 slots in any order across the three spins. 3. **Calculate the Number of Ways to Achieve the Desired Outcome**: You can land on any one of the three desired slots (300, 400, or 1000) in your first spin, which gives you 3 options. For the second spin, you have 2 remaining options (since one of the desired slots has already been chosen in the first spin).

First, we will define the probabilities for both scenarios: using the fair coin and using the possibly biased coin from the envelope. 1. **Define the probability of winning with the fair coin:** Let ( q(n) ) be the probability of winning from the ( n )-th rung using the fair coin. The recurrence relation for ( q(n) ) is: [ q(n) = frac{q(n-1) + q(n+1)}{2} ] This equation reflects the equal probability of moving up or down with each flip of the fair coin. 2. **Solve the recurrence for ( q(n) ):** By analyzing boundary conditions: - ( q(0) = 0 ) (If you're at the bottom, you lose immediately) - ( q(6) = 1 ) (If you move up from the top rung, you win) Solve the recurrence relation: [ q(n) = frac{n}{6} ] This states that the probability of winning with the fair coin increases linearly with the rung number. 3. **Analyze the probabilities for different rungs if opening the envelope:** Assume the envelope contains a double-headed or double-tailed coin each with probability ( frac{1}{2} ).

Hence, any given radius has an expected lifespan of ( 2pi ) turns before it gets covered. 4. **Expected number of visible radii over many turns:** Over ( n gg 1 ) turns, there are ( 2n ) total radii created. Each radius lasts for an average of ( 2pi ) turns. Therefore, we expect [ frac{2n cdot 2pi}{n} = 4pi ] radii to be visible on average. 5. **Probabilistic approach with convergence:** A more rigorous evaluation shows each set of radii created on a specific turn has independent probabilities of remaining visible. The expected number of exposed radii is given by [ 2 left(1 + (1-p) + (1-p)^2 + cdots + (1-p)^{n-1} right). ] This geometric series converges to ( frac{2}{p} ) as ( n ) grows. Hence, [ frac{2}{frac{1}{2pi}} = 4pi. ] 6. **Solution convergence:** Summarizing the above steps, we observe that as ( n to infty ), the expected number of visible colors ( c_n ) converges to ( 4pi ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{4pi} ]"},{"prompt":"f line l intersects plane alpha but is not perpendicular to it, then which of the following is true?

However, since all balls in each box get thoroughly mixed, we consider the conditions after mixing. 4. **Final Counts**: - The red box now contains 92 red balls plus the 8 balls transferred from the green box. - The green box now contains the remaining balls after 8 were moved to the red box. 5. **Calculation of Mixed Balls**: - The green box originally had 8 red balls out of a total of 108 balls. When transferring 8 balls from the green box to the red box: - Probability that a transferred ball is red (= frac{text{Number of red balls in green box}}{text{Total number of balls in green box}} = frac{8}{108}). - Thus, on average, ( frac{8}{108} times 8 approx 0.59 ) red balls are transferred back, but since we deal with integer counts, it's more practical to consider 1 red ball (as rounding). 6. **Final Configuration**: - After transferring 8 balls back to the red box (primarily green), the red box contains approximately 1 green ball and 99 red balls. - Similarly, the green box contains 99 green balls (after 7 green and 1 red assumed back transfer) and one red ball. 7. **Probability Comparison**: - Probability of picking a green ball from the red box is ( frac{1}{100} ). - Probability of picking a red ball from the green box is ( frac{1}{100} ).

Remove ( u ), ( v ) and all edges incident to them from ( G ). Denote the resulting graph as ( G' ). 4. **Non-adjacency Argument**: ( G' ) will have ( 2k ) vertices and no ( K_3 ) subgraph by construction. By the induction hypothesis, ( G' ) has at most (frac{4k^2}{4} = k^2 ) edges. - No vertex in ( G' ) can be adjacent to both ( u ) and ( v ), otherwise ( u, v ), and this vertex would form a triangle. - If ( u ) is adjacent to ( l ) vertices in ( G' ), then ( v ) can be adjacent to at most ( 2k - l ) vertices.

How many chocolates were bought at the cost price?","completion":"Let's assume the cost price of one chocolate is 1. So, the cost price of 24 chocolates would be 24. Given that the gain percent is 83.33333333333334%, we can express this as a fraction of 100, which is 5/6 (since 83.33333333333334% is 5/6 of 100 when expressed as a fraction). The gain on the selling of 24 chocolates is 5/6 of the cost price of those chocolates. So, if the cost price is 24, the gain is: Gain = (5/6) * 24 Now, let's calculate the gain: Gain = (5/6) * 24 Gain = 5 * 4 Gain = 20 This means that the selling price of 24 chocolates is the cost price plus the gain, which is 24 + 20 = 44. Now, if the selling price of 24 chocolates is 44, and the cost price of one chocolate is 1, then the number of chocolates bought at the cost price for 44 would be: Number of chocolates = Total cost price / Cost price per chocolate Number of chocolates = 44 / 1 Number of chocolates = 44 So, boxed{44} chocolates were bought at the cost price."},{"prompt":"According to the information from the Ministry of Transport, on the first day of the May Day holiday in 2023, the total number of operating passenger trips nationwide was approximately 56.99 million.

Popcorn with 15% discount: 5 - (15% of 5) = 5 - (5 * 0.15) = 5 - 0.75 = 4.25 2. Candy with 10% discount: 3 - (10% of 3) = 3 - (3 * 0.10) = 3 - 0.30 = 2.70 Now, let's calculate the total normal cost with the discounts: Total normal cost = Movie ticket + Discounted popcorn + Drink + Discounted candy Total normal cost = 8 + 4.25 + 6 + 2.70 = 20.95 The deal offers all these for 20, so the savings in dollars would be: Savings in dollars = Total normal cost - Deal price Savings in dollars = 20.95 - 20 = 0.95 Now, let's convert the savings into euros using the exchange rate of 1 USD = 0.85 EUR: Savings in euros = Savings in dollars * Exchange rate Savings in euros = 0.95 * 0.85 = €0.8075 Therefore, the European customer saves approximately boxed{€0.81} with the deal."},{"prompt":"Betty goes to the store to buy rice and beans.

The problem requires us to find the minimum value of the expression (sum frac{b+3}{a^{2}+4}), given the constraint (a + b + c + d = 4) where (a, b, c,) and (d) are non-negative real numbers. 2. We start by analyzing the function (frac{1}{a^{2} + 4}) and derive a useful inequality: [ frac{1}{a^{2} + 4} geq frac{4 - a}{16}. ] To show this, we work with the inequality: [ frac{1}{a^{2} + 4} geq frac{4 - a}{16} Leftrightarrow 16 geq (a^2 + 4)(4 - a) = 4a^2 - a^3 + 16 - 4a. ] 3. Simplifying, we have: [ 16 geq 4a^2 - a^3 + 16 - 4a Leftrightarrow 0 geq 4a^2 - a^3 - 4a. ] This can be re-arranged as: [ a(a - 2)^2 geq 0, ] which is obviously true since (a(a - 2)^2) is a product where each factor is non-negative. 4. Therefore, for each (i), we have: [ frac{1}{a^{2} + 4} geq frac{4 - a}{16}. ] Consequently, [ sum frac{b + 3}{a^{2} + 4} geq sum frac{(b + 3)(4 - a)}{16}. ] 5.

Further expanding the summation, we get: [ sum (b + 3)(4 - a) = sum (4b - ab + 12 - 3a). ] 7. This expands to: [ 4 sum b - sum ab + 12 sum 1 - 3 sum a. ] We know from the given condition (a + b + c + d = 4), thus: [ sum 1 = 4. ] Therefore, the expression simplifies to: [ frac{1}{16} left( 4 sum b - sum ab + 48 - 3 sum a right). ] 8.

When (a = b = 2) and (c = d = 0), (sum (b+3)/(a^2+4) = 3), equality holds.

This allows us to write the expression differently: [ (p + q - r)left(p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + pq + pr + qrright) = 0 ] This form comes from factoring the original polynomial expression.

The father's work rate is 1 job per 20 days, so his daily work rate is 1/20 of the job per day. The son's work rate is 1 job per 25 days, so his daily work rate is 1/25 of the job per day. When they work together, their work rates add up. So, the combined work rate is: (1/15) + (1/20) + (1/25) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator.

From the inequality: [ y+3 < x < y+4 ] Since y+3 and y+4 are consecutive integers, the only integer \`x\` between y+3 and y+4 is none. Hence, no integers \`x\` can satisfy this inequality unless we test smaller values for y. 7. Let's verify whether smaller values of y within a feasible range make the equation x^2 = y^2 + 7y + 6 valid. We will test for y = 0, 1, 2, 3. - For y = 0: [ x^2 = 0^2 + 7 cdot 0 + 6 = 6 quad (text{not a perfect square}) ] - For y = 1: [ x^2 = 1^2 + 7 cdot 1 + 6 = 14 quad (text{not a perfect square}) ] - For y = 2: [ x^2 = 2^2 + 7 cdot 2 + 6 = 24 quad (text{not a perfect square}) ] - For y = 3: [ x^2 = 3^2 + 7 cdot 3 + 6 = 39 + 6 = 36 quad (6^2 = 36, text{a perfect square}) ] Thus, x = 6. 8.

Once we have such points, we can scale them appropriately to make all distances integers. 2. **Constructing Points on the Unit Circle:** Consider the unit circle in the plane. We need to find points on this circle such that the distances between any two points are rational. 3. **Finding Rational Points on the Unit Circle:** We note that there are infinitely many rational numbers ( t ) such that ( t^2 + 1 ) is the square of a rational number. This can be achieved by taking ( t = frac{1}{2}left(x + frac{1}{x}right) ) for non-zero rational ( x ). This ensures that ( t ) is rational and ( t^2 + 1 ) is a perfect square. 4. **Parametrization of Points:** The points ( left(frac{t^2-1}{t^2+1}, frac{2t}{t^2+1}right) ) for such ( t ) all lie on the unit circle. These points are derived from the parametrization of the unit circle using rational functions. 5. **Distance Calculation:** The square of the distance between two points ( left(frac{t^2-1}{t^2+1}, frac{2t}{t^2+1}right) ) and ( left(frac{s^2-1}{s^2+1}, frac{2s}{s^2+1}right) ) on the unit circle is given by: [ left( frac{t^2-1}{t^2+1} - frac{s^2-1}{s^2+1} right)^2 + left( frac{2t}{t^2+1} - frac{2s}{s^2+1} right)^2 ] Simplifying this expression, we get: [ left( frac{(t^2-1)(s^2+1) - (s^2-1)(t^2+1)}{(t^2+1)(s^2+1)} right)^2 + left( frac{2t(s^2+1) - 2s(t^2+1)}{(t^2+1)(s^2+1)} right)^2 ] [ = left( frac{t^2s^2 + t^2 - s^2 - 1 - s^2t^2 - s^2 + t^2 + 1}{(t^2+1)(s^2+1)} right)^2 + left( frac{2ts^2 + 2t - 2st^2 - 2s}{(t^2+1)(s^2+1)} right)^2 ] [ = left( frac{2(t^2 - s^2)}{(t^2+1)(s^2+1)} right)^2 + left( frac{2(t - s)}{(t^2+1)(s^2+1)} right)^2 ] [ = frac{4(t^2 - s^2)^2 + 4(t - s)^2}{(t^2+1)^2(s^2+1)^2} ] [ = frac{4(t - s)^2 (t + s)^2 + 4(t - s)^2}{(t^2+1)^2(s^2+1)^2} ] [ = frac{4(t - s)^2 ((t + s)^2 + 1)}{(t^2+1)^2(s^2+1)^2} ] Since ( (t + s)^2 + 1 ) is a rational number, the distance between any two points is rational. 6. **Conclusion:** By choosing 2012 distinct rational values of ( t ), we obtain 2012 points on the unit circle such that no three points are collinear and the distances between any two points are rational. Scaling these points appropriately will give us 2012 points with integer distances.

According to the information given: - 35% of the employees are men, so there are 35 men. - 60% of these men speak French, so 0.60 * 35 = 21 men speak French. - 40% of all employees speak French, so 0.40 * 100 = 40 employees speak French.

We know that 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds. So, to convert km/hr to m/s, we multiply by 1000 and divide by 3600.

Since b_3 = -2 and b_{10} = 12, we can express the first few terms of {b_n} as follows: b_1 + 2d = -2 and b_1 + 9d = 12. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we find b_1 = -6 and d = 2. Thus, the general term for {b_n} can be written as: b_n = -6 + 2(n - 1) = 2n - 8. Now since b_n = a_{n+1} - a_n, we can express a_n in terms of the differences between consecutive terms: a_n = (a_n - a_{n-1}) + (a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}) + ldots + (a_2 - a_1) + a_1 = (2n - 8) + (2(n - 1) - 8) + ldots + (-4) + 3.

Title: The Hidden Realms of Eldoria Chapter One: The Mysterious Map Once upon a time, in the bustling town of Newwick, four friends found themselves gathered at The Rusty Anchor, their favorite seaside tavern. There was Jack, with his charming smile and windswept hair, always catching the gazes of passersby. Dan's laughter filled the air, his collection of outlandish stories never failing to entertain. Ros, with her fiery red hair, sat with confident posture as she meticulously organized her notes from their recent travels. And Molly, whose serene demeanor and cheerful spirit was a beacon of light in the dimly lit establishment. As the night grew older and the crowd thinned, an elderly man approached their table with a weathered scroll in hand. His eyes, clouded by age, met each of the friends in turn. \\"I've heard of your escapades,\\" he croaked, \\"and I believe you're just the group for the task.\\" He unrolled the scroll, revealing a complex and ancient map with symbols none of them recognized. Ros leaned in, her keen eyes scanning the cryptic legends. \\"This is Eldoria,\\" she whispered in awe. \\"A hidden realm said to contain treasures unimagined, protected by riddles and traps.\\" Dan's eyes sparkled with mischief. \\"Well, mates, sounds like we've got our next adventure cut out for us!\\" Chapter Two: Through the Whispering Woods The friends embarked at dawn, the map guiding them to the edge of the Whispering Woods. It was said that the trees themselves held secrets of those who dared traverse their depths. Jack led boldly, his compass in hand, ensuring they stayed true to the path marked on their mysterious guide. As the woods grew denser and the light dimmer, Molly's lilting voice kept their spirits high. Her stories of hope and courage echoed through the foliage, granting them the fortitude to resist the eerie whispers attempting to lure them astray. A clearing ahead presented their first challenge: a stone pedestal inscribed with ancient text that Ros swiftly deciphered. \\"It is a riddle,\\" she announced, her voice steady. \\"To pass, we must solve it.\\" Chapter Three: The Riddling Stone Around the pedestal, the group huddled, peering at the inscription which read: \\"I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?\\" Dan chuckled, the answer on the tip of his tongue. \\"An echo!\\" he exclaimed, and the stone slid away to reveal a hidden stairway spiraling down into darkness. Chapter Four: The Labyrinth of Echoes Descending the stairs, they found themselves in a labyrinth built of stone and silence. The journey was treacherous, with false turns and dead ends. While Jack relied on his sense of direction, Molly maintained a lithe grace, her intuition guiding their steps through the indiscernible paths. Their faith in each other was their anchor, and together they emerged into an open cavern, where the greatest challenge yet awaited. Chapter Five: The Heart of Eldoria The cavern boasted a grandeur they'd never before seen, crystals illuminating walls of untold stories. At its heart stood a pedestal, clenching a single, luminescent orb. It was the Heart of Eldoria, the source of the realm's ancient power. Jack moved toward it, but Ros held him back. \\"Careful,\\" she said. \\"There is one last riddle.\\" Three stone figures encircled the orb, each with a missing element: a sword, a crown, and a gem. The riddle etched before them read: \\"Bravery, wisdom, spirit true, Each must claim what's due. Three lost treasures hidden well, Together held, the spell unseal.\\" Dan's eyes gleamed. \\"We must find these items and return them to the statues.\\" The friends dispersed in search of the elements. Jack’s valor guided him to the hidden sword, Ros's intellect revealed the concealed crown, and Molly's positive spirit uncovered the gem. With each item restored, the pedestal activated, releasing the orb's gentle light, which enveloped the cavern, then vanished, leaving a treasure chest in its place. Epilogue: A New Dawn The friends stood before the chest, reflecting on the bond that had carried them through their journey. Upon opening the chest, they found it filled not with gold, but with an array of seeds. A note lay atop them, inscribed with a message: \\"Plant these in your world, let Eldoria’s essence thrive, for the true treasure is life.\\" And so they did. The friends returned home, their hearts full, as they sowed the seeds of Eldoria, watching as wonders grew, forever changing Newwick and the world beyond, together in adventure and friendship everlasting."},{"prompt":"bu yazmış olduğun hikayeyi ayrı sahneler olarak düşün ve her bir sahneyi madde olarak yaz.","completion":"Certainly!

Each of them had their unique traits that, when combined, created the perfect balance for embarking on unforgettable adventures. Jack, with his charming smile and cool demeanor, was the one who could talk them into or out of any situation. Dan, the life of the party, was always ready with a joke or a prank, keeping spirits high even when the going got tough. Ros, with her fiery red hair and sharp intellect, was the strategist, planning their every move with confidence and discipline. And sweet Molly, with her endless positivity and calm nature, was the glue that held them together, especially in the face of danger or uncertainty. One fine day, the four friends decided to take on a challenge that many before them had failed: to find the legendary treasure of Old Oak Island. The treasure, as the story goes, was hidden by a mysterious figure known only as the Phantom Pirate and was said to be protected by cunning riddles and dangerous traps. Armed with a tattered map they stumbled upon in an old bookstore, Jack's leadership, Dan's humor, Ros's smarts, and Molly's calmness, they set out on an adventure of a lifetime. The first stop was to decipher a riddle that would lead them to the starting point on the island: \\"Where shadows dance and time stands still, Find the watcher on the hill. His hollow gaze and outstretched hand Points to where X marks the land.\\" With Ros's analytical mind at work, they quickly identified the \\"watcher\\" as the oldest tree on the island, known for its eerie humanoid appearance. They rushed to the hill where the ancient tree stood and, sure enough, found the next clue hidden within its hollow trunk. Their journey led them through tangled forests and across streaming rivers. They avoided clever traps, from pitfalls to hidden nets, often saved by Molly's intuition and Dan's agile reflexes. Jack's allure even tamed a wild beast they encountered, turning it into an ally rather than a foe. The final challenge required them to solve a puzzle in a cave where echoing whispers filled the air. It was a puzzle that only the combined talents of their group could solve. Molly kept the group grounded when the whispers tried to sow discord, and Dan lightened the mood with his witty remarks. Finally, it was Ros who, after hours of trial and error, pieced the puzzle together, triggering a mechanism that revealed the hidden chamber where the treasure lay waiting. Piles of gold coins, dazzling jewels, and ancient artifacts shone under the flickering torchlight. As they emerged from the cave, victorious and richer in more ways than one, they realized that the true treasure was not just the chest of wealth but the unbreakable bond of their friendship. Each adventure tested their limits and showed them that together, they were an unstoppable force. With hearts full of joy and a tale that would be told for generations, Jack, Dan, Ros, and Molly returned home, ready for the next adventure life would throw their way. And so, the legend of the Four Adventurers was born, inspiring all who heard their story to find their own treasures in the world and the people around them.

To understand these properties and how they are used, it is important to be familiar with a few key concepts including Mach number, pressure ratio, temperature ratio, and density ratio associated with the flow. Isentropic flow tables or charts are commonly used in aerospace, mechanical, and chemical engineering to quickly find the properties of a compressible fluid (often air) as it flows through a nozzle, diffuser, or other devices. These tables typically contain the following columns, and here's a brief guide on how to interpret them: 1. Mach number (M): This is the ratio of the flow velocity to the local speed of sound. It is a dimensionless number used to characterize the flow regime: subsonic (M<1), transonic (M≈1), supersonic (M>1), and hypersonic (M>>1). 2. Pressure ratio (p/p0 or P/P*): The ratio of the local static pressure (p) to the total pressure (p0 for reservoir or P* for stagnation conditions). In isentropic flow, this ratio depends only on Mach number and specific heat ratio (γ) of the fluid. 3. Temperature ratio (T/T0 or T/T*): The ratio of the local static temperature (T) to the total temperature (T0 or T*). Similar to pressure, this ratio also depends solely on Mach number and γ. 4. Density ratio (ρ/ρ0 or ρ/ρ*): The ratio of the local static density (ρ) to the total density (ρ0 or ρ*). 5. Area ratio (A/A*): The ratio of the local flow area (A) to the area where the flow is sonic (A*; the throat area in a convergent-divergent nozzle). This comes from the relationship between the Mach number and the cross-sectional area of the flow and is relevant in nozzle and diffuser design. 6. Velocity (v): The local flow velocity which is often normalized by the speed of sound (v/a*). To use these charts or tables, you usually start with a known quantity, such as the Mach number or the pressure ratio, and then read off the other properties based on that initial value. Here is how you might use these tables in practice: - **Find Mach number**: If you know some of the flow properties, for example, the static pressure and the stagnation pressure, you can use the pressure ratio to find the Mach number. - **Find other properties**: Once you have the Mach number, you can find the corresponding temperature and density ratios in the table. These ratios are used to calculate the actual temperatures and densities if the stagnation values are known. - **Design applications**: If you are designing a nozzle or a diffuser, you may be interested in the area ratio, which will help you determine the size and shape of the device based on the desired Mach number at the exit or other points within the system. To interpret the values correctly, keep in mind the following: - As the Mach number increases above 1, the pressure, temperature, and density ratios decrease, which means that the flow's static pressure, temperature, and density are decreasing in relation to their total values. - In supersonic flow (M > 1), the area ratio increases with Mach number, meaning that the flow area must expand to accelerate the flow further (contrary to subsonic flow where the flow area must contract to accelerate the flow). This is explained by the fact that in a supersonic flow the density drops faster than the increase of velocity, needing a larger area to maintain continuity. - Always double-check the definitions in the specific table or chart you are using, as symbols and their meanings might vary slightly between different textbooks or references. Isentropic flow tables are often used in conjunction with the ideal gas law and other fundamental thermodynamic equations to complete the analysis of flow systems. It is important to remember that the isentropic assumption is an idealization. In reality, flows often incur losses due to friction, shock waves, and other non-ideal effects, especially in transonic and supersonic regimes."},{"prompt":"consider a point in an airflow where M= 3.5 and T=180kelvin. Using the Isentropic Flow Table, find the values of a, a*, u* and M*. show your steps","completion":"To find the values of the speed of sound (a), the speed of sound at the throat (a*), flow velocity at the throat (u*), and Mach number at the throat (M*), given Mach number (M) and temperature (T), we will follow several steps: 1. Speed of sound (a): The speed of sound in a gas is given by the equation: [ a = sqrt{gamma RT} ] Assuming we are dealing with air, the ratio of specific heats (γ) is typically 1.4 and the individual gas constant for air (R) is approximately 287 J/(kg·K). Given T = 180 K, we can calculate 'a': [ a = sqrt{1.4 times 287 times 180} ] [ a = sqrt{1.4 times 51540} ] [ a = sqrt{72156} ] [ a = 268.62 text{ m/s} ] 2. Finding Stagnation (Total) Temperature (T0): From the isentropic flow equations, we have the total-to-static temperature ratio as, [ frac{T_0}{T} = 1 + frac{gamma - 1}{2} M^2 ] [ frac{T_0}{180} = 1 + frac{1.4 - 1}{2} times 3.5^2 ] [ frac{T_0}{180} = 1 + 0.2 times 12.25 ] [ frac{T_0}{180} = 1 + 2.45 ] [ frac{T_0}{180} = 3.45 ] [ T_0 = 3.45 times 180 ] [ T_0 = 621 K ] 3. Speed of sound at the throat (a*): Since at the throat (the point in a converging-diverging nozzle where M = 1), the total and static temperatures are equal (T0 = T*). [ a* = sqrt{gamma RT*} ] [ a* = sqrt{gamma RT_0} ] Putting the values we found for T0, we get: [ a* = sqrt{1.4 times 287 times 621} ] [ a* = sqrt{1.4 times 178287} ] [ a* = sqrt{249601.8} ] [ a* = 499.6 text{ m/s} ] 4. Flow velocity at the throat (u*): We can assume that the throat flow velocity (u*) is equal to the local speed of sound because Mach number at the throat (M*) is 1. So, [ u* = a* ] [ u* = 499.6 text{ m/s} ] 5. Mach number at the throat (M*): By definition at the throat, M* is 1 because it's where the flow transitions from subsonic to supersonic in a converging-diverging nozzle. So, [ M* = 1 ] That said, please note the following: - Actual values might slightly vary based on the specific heat ratio (γ) used, which can be different for air at different conditions. - To obtain precise values from isentropic tables, one would need to look up the given M value (in this case, M = 3.5) in the table and read off the properties directly or use interpolation if necessary. - This calculation assumes ideal gas behavior, which is a common assumption for air under typical conditions. However, real gases can deviate from ideal behavior, especially at high Mach numbers or at extreme temperatures and pressures. This calculation provides estimates based on the given information and the ideal gas assumption. For highly accurate analysis or different conditions, consider consulting specific isentropic flow property tables or using computational fluid dynamics tools."},{"prompt":"Оригинальный сюжет игры Ben and Ed: Игра \\"Ben and Ed\\" - это трехмерный платформер, где игрок управляет зомби по имени Эд, который должен преодолевать множество препятствий и ловушек, чтобы спасти своего лучшего друга, мальчика по имени Бен.

ED’S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT The two of them, alone against the tapestry of the night sky, settle into a silence under the stars. The darkness is pierced by the soft flicker of candlelight.

Around the corner lumbers a group of zombies, their movements jerky and erratic. The sight is jarring, the realization of their nightmare fully manifest. MARIA (in a hushed tone) Ed… Without hesitation, ED takes the lead, signaling MARIA to stay behind him. Despite his scientific mind rebelling against the logic of their existence, his survival instincts kick in. They back away slowly, but the zombies advance with increasing hunger. The corridor’s confines amplify their mangled cries. Ed and Maria turn to run, but the creatures are relentless in pursuit. One of the zombies lunges forward, catching ED by the arm. Its teeth sink into his flesh—a searing pain that echoes with the unbearable finality of his fate. MARIA (screaming) Ed!

MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed.

ABANDONED SCHOOL - MORNING ED KAYNES, his body a mismatch of human fear and zombified resilience, slips through the shattered gates of what was once a sanctuary of learning. A tattered scarf partially conceals his grotesque features, signs of his incomplete transformation into the undead. Silently, he navigates the overgrown courtyard, each step deliberate to avoid drawing attention. Windows, dark and soulless, gape open like the eyes of the dead—witnesses to the devastation within. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Ed’s entry is a mirror to his internal chaos—a man, formerly a herald of progress, now reduced to a creature of instinct and desperation. His gait, once confident, is now a sober march into the unknown. He tiptoes past classrooms where silent echoes of children’s laughter are replaced by the somber reality of abandonment. Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom. Ed suppresses a shudder, steeling himself against the macabre scenery.

Sunlight streams through broken skylights, carving shadows that pool like blood on the hardwood floor. He scans the rafters, a haunting tableau of memories and lost days playing out in the sunbeams. As real as the danger is, it’s the threat of finding irrevocable truth that tightens his chest—a father’s fear, potent even in undeath. But there’s no trace, no joyous clamor of children, no after-school exclamations. They’re gone, swept away by the cataclysm that swept through their lives like a malevolent tide. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges from the school, the line between man and zombie blurred by his faltering, heart-wrenching mission. Desolation repels hope like opposite poles of a tragic magnet. Torn by failure, Ed turns away from the forlorn landmark of his children’s laughter, now a crypt to his unspoken fear. His eyes, rimmed with the red of grief and infection, look beyond—towards the distant, fortified silhouette of his bunker. MONTAGE – ED’S JOURNEY TO THE BUNKER: - Ed’s shadow stretches along the cracked pavement as he trudges through the eerie streets, a spectral figure moving against the grain of desolation. - At intersections, he ducks into the shadows, avoiding the roving packs of zombies that cluster around the remnants of life—imperfect kin he no longer resembles. - The bunker’s hidden entrance, a sliver between the ruins, beckons—a sanctuary amid a city usurped by death. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS A blast door seals with an echo, enveloping Ed in the silence of his clandestine refuge.

Amid the quiet hum of survival equipment, Ed perches on the edge of a cot, hands clasped, elbows resting on his knees. He is the epitome of the isolated soul—lost in the chasm between the living and the not. Remnants of humanity nest in the bunker—photographs, clothes, a child’s crayon drawing affixed to a wall. Through the stillness, Ed’s rasping breath is a dissonant chorus, filling the void with his internal war. ED (muttering to himself) I’ll find them—alive or… I must. He rises, a gaunt figure against the backdrop of monitors flickering with disconnected surveillance feeds. With grim acceptance, he begins to arm himself for the world above, the haven below now a grave to his former self. END OF PAGE 31 OF 150 PAGE 32 OF 15 INT.

A gasp of despair chokes out as he beholds the naked scalp in the mirror, a stark declaration of his metamorphosis. Tears well up, spilling over, tracing grimy paths down his deformed cheeks. The bunker trembles, a distant cataclysm making the very earth weep. A shelf rattles and the few personal effects he’s salvaged from his previous life threaten to tumble and shatter. ED (Screaming, his voice a ragged echo of rage and fear) NOOOOO! NO!..NO! Overcome with grief, he slams a fist against the mirror, the crack spider-webbing across his fractured reflection. His knees buckle, and he sinks to the ground amidst the fallen hair—an island of agony in a sea of cold tile. His wails fill the cramped space, a chilling symphony to a soul in mourning. And in this moment of anguish, the bunker shakes—dust falling like ancient witnesses to his pain. Shelves rattle, threatening to topple, the explosion’s distant thunder a cruel reminder of the world falling apart above.

Bitter laughter, a guttural sound devoid of humor, escapes him as he contemplates the irony—the mad scientist, the living dead, now the audience to Armageddon. ED (to himself, the laugh collapsing into a growl) We played with life and death… and now we pay the price. He rises, each movement a struggle as he opens a secure drawer, retrieving a dusty bottle of whiskey, a relic from a past life. He unscrews the cap and takes a swig, the burn a fleeting reminder of human sensations.

He hits the master lockdown button, and with a metallic groan, reinforced doors slide shut, drowning the chaos into muffled fury. The sanctuary becomes sarcophagus. Over the din of destruction, Ed’s distorted cry resonates—half man, half beast, all despair. ED (screaming above the noise) Survive! I must… survive… The camera pulls out from the scene, leaving Ed a solitary, writhing figure amidst the anarchy that ensnares him—an amalgam of man’s hubris and the savage grip of nature’s retribution, locked in a bunker, locked in turmoil.

Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT. CITY RUINS - SAME MOMENT A cloud of dust and debris blankets the horizon where the city once teemed with life. The singular fury of the initial blast has given birth to countless offspring—sporadic eruptions that devour the remnants of a world now confined to memory and echoes. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed gasps, his body hauled up to an unsteady crouch, fingertips white-knuckled as they grip a shattered piece of the console for support. Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult. ED (voice a raspy whisper tinged with determination) Not yet… Not today… Tremors wrack his form, but they cannot break the spirit that fuels his battered frame. This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end. FADE TO BLACK: END OF PAGE 37 OF 150 PAGE 38 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker’s foundation rattles under the relentless assault, dust cascading like tiny waterfalls from the ceiling. ED, half-zombie, stands amidst a glistening coat of sweat and grime, swaying unevenly as the earth beneath him convulses. He fixates on the emergency lighting, its flickering a spasmodic dirge to the rhythm of apocalypse, his mind racing with primal urgency. Every painful breath is a struggle, drowning in a sea of helplessness and confusion. His flesh, marked both by the zest of the undead and the scars of scientific torment, stretches over his hands as if trying to flee from the bone. His ashen lips mutter a garbled prayer to loved ones lost to either fate or the flame. Ed staggers forward, a mote of dust in the grim tableau of his sanctuary. He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 38 OF 150 PAGE 39 OF 150 EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY From the depths of the bunker, ED emerges into a world transformed beyond recognition. A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT.

SCIENCE CITY - DAY A kaleidoscope of SOLAR PANELS and GREEN ROOFS adorn the landscape of SCIENCE CITY. Bustling streets teem with the ENERGY of progress, where LAB-COATED PROFESSIONALS and STUDENTS intermingle, embodying the city's thirst for knowledge. The camera pans across VIBRANT DIGITAL BILLBOARDS, showcasing mesmerizing infographics of the latest scientific breakthroughs. The AMBIENT NOISE of metropolitan life harmonizes with the WHIRR of machinery from the nearby RESEARCH CENTERS. EDWARD “ED” KAYNES (mid-30s), a prominent FIGURE in the scientific community, strides confidently through the crowd. His eyes, a reflective pool of ambition and anticipation, scan the city he helped mold. ED (to himself, in awe) Welcome to the epitome of human ingenuity—Science City. Ed's PHONE RINGS, a brisk TONE that signals urgency. He answers, eyes never leaving the architectural marvels that speak to man's triumph over nature. ED (CONT’D) (into phone) Kaynes here. Yes, make sure the lab's prepped for assembly. Today changes everything. The camera follows Ed's determined gaze upwards — TOWARDS THE SKY where DRONES hum above, a dance in the air choreographed by today's needs and tomorrow's dreams. A STUDENT, backpack slung over her shoulder, approaches Ed. Her admiration is palpable, her eyes wide with curiosity. STUDENT (excited) Dr. Kaynes, is it true? The rumors about reversing aging? ED (a smile playing on his lips) You're looking at a new era of discovery. The boundaries of age are about to become a relic of the past. Their dialogue is drowned by the BUZZ of conversations and the CLANGING sounds of RENEWABLE ENERGY structures at work. An electronic CHIME signals the start of the day. Ed glances at his watch, a sorry SMILE breaking across his face. ED (CONT'D) (to the student) Duty calls. As Ed walks off, the camera ZOOMS IN ON HIS BACK, a man against the tapestry of his creation, where every building and every street corner whispers tales of the science that throbs in its veins.

Dan's laughter echoed through the air, his wild gesticulation causing a flock of birds to take flight. Ros adjusted her glasses, brushing a strand of her fiery red hair aside with a disciplined motion. Molly, with her infectious smile and easy-going nature, strolled gently towards her friends, a basket of freshly baked goods in her arms. \\"Check this out!\\" Dan exclaimed, holding up an old, tattered map he'd found hidden in his attic. \\"This could be our ticket to the greatest adventure yet!\\" Jack stepped forward, intrigued, while Ros moved closer, her analytical mind already decoding the map's secrets. Molly's enthusiasm bubbled over, her positivity ensuring that the group's morale would never drop. \\"Looks like it leads to the lost treasure of Everwood,\\" Ros mused, studying the cryptic symbols. \\"To find it, we'll need to combine our strengths.\\" **Chapter Two: The Enigma of the Enchanted Forest** The map led them to the fringe of the famed Enchanted Forest where myths and legends lurked in every shadow. Jack's confidence brimmed as he effortlessly navigated through the dense foliage. Dan entertained them with tall tales, slipping over a hidden root only to bounce back up with a wide grin. As twilight approached, the forest's mystique revealed itself—a grove of luminescent flowers surrounded by ancient runes. Only Ros could decipher them, her brow furrowed in concentration. \\"It's a puzzle,\\" Ros declared. \\"And it requires precise timing to unlock the path.\\" With Molly's serenity balancing the team's fervor, they managed to solve Ros's riddle and stepped into the heart of the forest where they were greeted by an unexpected guardian. **Chapter Three: The Guardian's Trial** A majestic stag, with antlers that seemed to touch the sky, stood in their path. Its eyes shimmered with an otherworldly wisdom. \\"You seek the treasure,\\" it spoke, its voice a melodic whisper, \\"but are you worthy?\\" Jack, undeterred by the creature's imposing presence, stepped forward. \\"We are,\\" he affirmed, his confidence unshaken. The stag nodded gravely. \\"Then you must each pass a trial that reflects your true essence.\\" Dan faced a challenge of wit, where his gift of gab turned into a tool for riddles and tongue-twisters. Laughter proved to be Dan's secret weapon, and he spun words into keys that unraveled the test. Ros's intellect was tested through a labyrinth of logic, her every step calculated and precise. She wove through the maze with determination, each move a testament to her keen mind. Molly's trial lay in a garden of discord, where she had to calm the chaos with her ever-present optimism. Her tranquility radiated, calming the tempest, and she walked through unscathed. Jack's charisma allowed him to face the reflection of his own ego. He had to learn that true leadership wasn't just about being at the forefront but also about trust in his friends to lead with him. Only then did they all pass the guardian's trials. **Chapter Four: The Treasure Beyond Gold** Having overcome their trials, the stag led them to the heart of the forest where the treasure lay hidden. However, it wasn't gold or jewels that awaited them; instead, a fountain of crystal-clear water with the power to bring prosperity to Everwood bubbled before them. \\"It's the true treasure,\\" Ros whispered, her eyes reflecting the water's clarity. Dan set off fireworks of joy, Molly hugged each of her friends, and Jack, with humility shining in his eyes, shook hands with the stag. \\"For you have learned that the greatest treasures are those that benefit all,\\" the stag intoned. \\"This water will heal and enrich your land.\\" **Chapter Five: Return of the Champions** The quartet returned to Everwood as heroes, the mystery of the treasure now a story they would pass down through generations. Each adventure had brought them closer, their friendship the real prize they would always cherish. Jack, now humbled, Dan, ever the jester but wiser, Ros, respected for her intellect more than ever, and Molly, the heart of the group, walked through the town square where the folks of Everwood greeted them with a celebration that would be remembered for ages to come. And so the story of Jack, Dan, Ros, and Molly became legend, their bond a testament to the power of camaraderie, their personalities forever woven into the tapestry of Everwood's history."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Jack, with his captivating looks and cool demeanor, could calm any storm with just a smile. Dan, the red-haired genius with confidence as vast as the sea, was the source of brilliant ideas and well-orchestrated plans. Their story unfolds starting in the quiet comfort of Ros's little garden, where the mischievous strategist, with her uncanny ability to understand nature, prepared her next botanical experiment. And there was Molly, bright as the dawn, whose laughter was a balm to troubled hearts, and whose serenity was as deep as the earth. **Scene 1: The Mysterious Map** One dusky evening, our four heroes gathered in Ros's garden. Jack leaned against an ancient oak tree, his eyes twinkling with anticipation. Dan was scrutinizing a strange map that had mysteriously arrived in his mailbox. Molly, full of curiosity, was peering over Dan's shoulder, while Ros nurtured a sapling with her green thumb. \\"Look here,\\" Dan said, pointing at an unfilled section of the map. \\"This map shows a hidden cave beyond the Whispering Woods, rumored to hold the treasure of the ancient Guardians.\\" Molly's eyes sparkled. \\"Oh, think of the adventure! And imagine the stories we can tell!\\" Jack pushed off from the tree and flashed his signature grin. \\"Well, what are we waiting for? Adventure doesn't wait for anyone.\\" Ros nodded in agreement, her gaze fixed on the map. \\"Let’s use the stars to guide us. It's the Guardian’s way.\\" **Scene 2: Whispering Woods** The four friends made their way to the Whispering Woods. Jack led confidently, charming their path through the bramble. Dan consulted the map at intervals, ensuring they were on track. Molly filled the air with song to soothe the rumored spirits of the woods. Ros was observing the flora, collecting herbs that might come in handy. As night fell and the path grew treacherous, the trees seemed to murmur with an otherworldly presence. Molly's song wavered, then strengthened, casting a calm over the eerie whispers. \\"We mustn't show fear,\\" Molly said with a gentle smile. \\"Nature is our ally.\\" **Scene 3: The Guardian's Cave** At long last, they arrived at a hidden cove, veiled by cascading vines. Jack swept the vines aside, revealing the entrance to the Guardian's Cave, illuminated by the gentle glow of moonlight. \\"I'll lead,\\" Jack declared, his voice steady and true. Dan took a deep breath, stepping closer to analyze the cave's markings. \\"According to legend, the Guardians set traps to protect their treasure. We must be vigilant.\\" With renewed resolve and cautious footsteps, they ventured inside. Ros deftly spotted and disarmed the ancient traps with botanical ingenuity, while Molly's unwavering optimism kept their spirits high. **Scene 4: The Treasure Chamber** Finally, they stood before a grand chamber. At its center was a pedestal holding a dazzling orb that radiated with the pure essence of the Guardians. The treasure was not gold or jewels, but the source of harmony between humans and nature. \\"Our hearts brought us here,\\" Molly whispered, her voice reflecting the wonder in her eyes. \\"And our unity will allow us to bring this back,\\" Dan added, his intelligence shining as brightly as the treasure before them. \\"It's our duty to protect this,\\" said Jack, who despite his looks, now showed the depth of his character. Ros stepped forward, gently lifting the orb. \\"We will, together.\\" **Scene 5: The Journey Home** With the orb safely in their care, the four friends journeyed home under a sky now full of stars, reflecting the light they now held amongst them. They had found much more than treasure; they found strength in each other and a deeper purpose to their lives. Back in the garden where their adventure began, they gathered around the little sapling that Ros had planted earlier. The roots took hold, nourished by the light of the orb, a symbol that their bond would flourish for years to come. Molly giggled. \\"Adventure may not wait, but it sure does linger in the heart.\\" \\"Yes,\\" Ros agreed, \\"but only when shared with true friends.\\" Jack smiled, and Dan nodded, the map now a relic of their shared legacy. Their laughter mingled with the night air, holding the promise of countless adventures yet to come. The tale of Jack, Dan, Ros, and Molly became a beacon of camaraderie and exploration, inspiring all who would listen for generations."},{"prompt":"bu yazmış olduğun hikayeyi ayrı ayrı sahne olarak düşün ve bunları aynı madde olarak yaz.","completion":"**Scene 1: The Mysterious Map** - The friends are gathered in Ros's garden.

Their names were Jack, Dan, Ros, and Molly. Jack was a vision to behold, with an allure that seemed to dance around him like sunlight on water. His confidence matched his looks, and many admired him for his charismatic grace. Dan was the life of every gathering, the one who would make the crowd roar with laughter with his endless tales. Sometimes his chatter was a bit much, but his heart was full of kindness. Ros, with her flowing red hair, was the brains of the pack. She saw patterns and solutions, where others saw complications. Her confidence was not unfounded, for she was as brilliant as the stars that lit their night-time escapades. And Molly, ever cheerful and optimistic, floated through life like a gentle melody. Her calmness was a balm to their sometimes frenzied adventures. The story begins one dusky evening as the four friends sat by the river's edge, the sky awash with hues of lavender and orange. They were planning their next big adventure. **Scene 1: The Challenge** Jack stood up, the fading light catching the edges of his profile. \\"We must venture beyond the Whispering Caves and into the Unknown,\\" he declared with a daredevil gleam in his eyes. Dan added excitedly, with a bit too much volume, \\"And find the Lost Gem of Eldoria!\\" \\"According to legend,\\" Ros chimed in thoughtfully, \\"the Gem grants the finder a single wish. But it's hidden by enigmas and guarded by the Phantoms of the Deep.\\" Molly smiled softly, \\"Imagine the good we could do if we had a wish. Let's embark at dawn. The night can't hold back those who shine from within.\\" **Scene 2: The Journey Begins** The next morning, the air was crisp, and their spirits were high. They hiked through the dense forest, crossed babbling brooks, and scaled the heights of the Narrow Ridge. Their laughter echoed through the green canopy, and every daunting challenge was met with determination. Jack, leading the way with his unwavering stride, showed no fear. Dan, never missing a beat, entertained them with his wild anecdotes, even when the path ahead seemed ominous. Ros consulted the ancient map she had studied for weeks, deftly navigating the terrain and solving riddles that would lead them to their prize. And Molly, with her sunny disposition, mended quarrels and kept hope alive when shadows grew long and the group's energy waned. **Scene 3: The Whispering Caves** They reached the Whispering Caves by nightfall, greeted by a chorus of wind that sang through the hollows of ancient stone. \\"Here we must tread lightly,\\" warned Jack, \\"for echoes can awaken what lies beneath.\\" As they ventured deeper, Dan's hushed tones barely contained his excitement, and his whispers were like percussion in the eerie silence. Ros read the walls inscribed with cryptic symbols, her intellect piercing through the darkness, finding clues that directed them to a hidden passageway. Molly's serene courage kept them rooted, her presence a guiding star in the consuming dark. **Scene 4: Encounter with the Phantoms** In the heart of the cavern, they stumbled upon a great chasm, the bottom lost to an abyss. Across it, on a pedestal, shone the Lost Gem of Eldoria—their quest's end within reach. Jack prepared to swing across the chasm with a rope they found, but as he readied himself, shadows twisted into form and Phantoms of the Deep materialized. Dan's boisterous roar turned into war cries as he joked to mask his fear. \\"You've never met someone as talkative as me, have you?\\" Ros stood her ground, her cunning mind quickly devising a plan. \\"Ghosts are bound to the secrets they keep. If we solve the final riddle, they'll free the path.\\" Molly hummed an ancient lullaby, her voice a pure note amidst chaos, calming the Phantoms who were mesmerized by her tranquility. **Scene 5: The Wish and the Return** With the Phantoms subdued, Ros solved the riddle that unveiled a safe passage. Jack, with grace, swiped the Gem, and they all huddled, contemplating their wish. They wished not for riches or fame. Instead, they spoke the words: \\"Let our bond endure through time and trial.\\" With that, the Gem's glow intensified and then dimmed, its power spent. Smiling, the friends made their way back to the world above, their friendship firmer and hearts full of shared adventure. **The End** As they emerged into daylight, they knew there would be more adventures, more laughs, more riddles, and more moments of blissful peace. For in each other, they'd found treasures far richer than any gem could offer."},{"prompt":"bu yazmış olduğun hikayeyi ayrı ayrı sahne olarak düşün ve bunları aynı madde olarak göster","completion":"**Act I: The Gathering by the River** - Jack invites the group to seek out the Lost Gem of Eldoria beyond the Whispering Caves. - Dan erupts with excitement about the legend and the adventure awaiting them. - Ros lays out the legend's mechanics, mentioning the intellectual challenges and the Phantoms of the Deep. - Molly suggests the potential for using the wish for good and encourages optimism. **Act II: The Journey Commences** - The group hikes through natural obstacles, bonding and overcoming challenges together. - Jack leads fearlessly, embodying the group's courage. - Dan keeps spirits high with his stories despite the daunting path. - Ros uses her intellect and map to navigate and solve riddles. - Molly maintains harmony and hope among the group. **Act III: The Whispering Caves** - They enter the mysterious and singing caves, cautious of the echoes that might stir hidden dangers. - Jack advises stealth to avoid awakening the lurking threats. - Dan's contained excitement adds a tempo to the silence. - Ros interprets the cryptic symbols, finding a secret passage. - Molly's calmness anchors the group through the cavern's foreboding atmosphere. **Act IV: The Phantoms' Challenge** - Faced with a chasm and the Gem insight, specters known as the Phantoms of the Deep appear. - Jack prepares to overcome the physical barrier with dexterity. - Dan faces his fear with humor and joking challenges toward the Phantoms. - Ros calculates a plan, reasoning that solving the final riddle could dispel the Phantoms. - Molly's singing captivates the Phantoms, her peaceful presence providing a moment of respite. **Act V: The Wish Fulfilled** - The riddle is solved by Ros, revealing a safe path to the Gem. - Jack heroically retrieves the Gem, and the group deliberates on their wish. - United, they choose a wish that solidifies their friendship through all times and challenges. - The Gem's magic releases, and they exit the cave, their bonds strengthened and future adventures certain.

Here's a story featuring Jack, Dan, Ros, and Molly, with each embodying the character traits you've described: **Title: The Chronicles of the Daring Four** --- *Scene 1: The Old Mansion* As the sun set, casting a golden glow over the decrepit mansion, Jack led the curious troupe to the front gates. His confident strides and leather jacket gave him an air of coolness no haunted tale could chill. \\"Are you sure about this, Jack?\\" Molly asked, her comforting smile trying to ease the tension in the air, the pink streaks in her hair glowing with the last rays of the setting sun. Beside them, Dan chuckled, the glint of mischief in his eyes. \\"Aw, come on, Molly! It'll be fun! Or are you scared?\\" Ros, with her striking red hair pulled into a practical ponytail, hushed them with a glance from her sharp green eyes, as she consulted the old map she had sketched from tales and dusty books. \\"This mansion is said to hold the secrets of the Evermoor Sapphire. A jewel of unfathomable value,\\" she explained, her confidence never wavered by the looming darkness. *Scene 2: The Entrance Hall Puzzle* With a mighty push, the heavy wooden door groaned open, dust motes dancing like careless specters in the shaft of light from Molly's flashlight. The entryway was grand, but the splendor was marred by years of neglect. \\"Would you look at that?\\" Dan's voice echoed as he pointed to a series of curious inscriptions on the wall. \\"Those symbols must mean something!\\" Ros approached and studied the carvings. \\"It's a puzzle,\\" she declared. \\"We need to solve it to go further.\\" While Jack and Molly looked for clues in the surrounding hall, Dan couldn't help but touch everything within sight, inadvertently pressing a concealed button. Suddenly, a hidden door creaked open, revealing a staircase spiraling down into darkness. \\"Nice one, Dan!\\" Jack clapped him on the back, his admiration genuine. *Scene 3: The Undercroft Secrets* Descending the staircase, the four found themselves in an undercroft illuminated by flickering torches. The shadowy corners whispered of secrets and long-forgotten stories. Molly's uplifting demeanor lent strength to the group. \\"No matter what's down here, we have each other,\\" she said, her voice serene even as her heart raced with excitement. They stumbled upon a room filled with elaborate traps and crumbling statues. \\"We must tread carefully,\\" Ros advised, already analyzing the patterns of the traps' mechanisms. Working together, with Jack's dextrous maneuvers, Molly's reassurance, Dan's endless enthusiasm, and Ros's intellect, they navigated the treacherous room, emerging unscathed on the other side to a chamber aglow with the shimmering light of the Evermoor Sapphire. *Scene 4: The Guardian Encounter* As they approached the sapphire, a spectral figure materialized before them. It was the Guardian of the Evermoor, bound to protect the jewel through eternity. Jack stepped forward, his charm ever-present, even in the face of a ghost. \\"We mean no harm. We only wish to admire the sapphire's beauty.\\" The Guardian looked upon them, its ethereal eyes passing over each friend. \\"Many have come with greed in their hearts. Yet, you have shown courage, unity, and respect.\\" Ros took a daring step closer, her aura of self-assurity unwavering. \\"We seek only knowledge and adventure, not wealth.\\" Impressed, the Guardian granted them a riddle. Molly's optimism made the group believe they could solve it, and Dan's laughter cut through the tension. Together, they answered correctly. *Scene 5: The Sapphire's Secret* \\"You have proven yourselves,\\" the Guardian declared. \\"The secret of the Evermoor Sapphire is not its monetary value but the lesson it teaches about friendship and bravery.\\" With a smile as brilliant as the gem itself, Molly reached out, her hand phasing through the sapphire. It wasn't there to be taken, only to be discovered. They may not have left with material riches, but the adventure had forged their bonds stronger than ever. And as they left the mansion, the first light of dawn cresting the horizon, Jack, Dan, Ros, and Molly walked shoulder to shoulder, their laughter intertwining with the promises of countless adventures that lay ahead. *The End*"},{"prompt":"hikayeyi parça parça olarak düşün ve her sahneyi madde madde olarak yaz","completion":"Certainly, here is the story broken down into bullet points for each scene: **The Chronicles of the Daring Four** *Scene 1: The Old Mansion* - Jack confidently approaches the mansion, embodying coolness and allure. - Molly exhibits positivity and calm, questioning the decision but remaining supportive. - Dan introduces a sense of fun and mischief, dismissing fears with his humor. - Ros employs her intelligence and high self-esteem, explaining the mystery of the Evermoor Sapphire. *Scene 2: The Entrance Hall Puzzle* - The group pushes open the mansion's grand entrance, stepping into the dust-filled hall. - Dan notices and points out puzzling inscriptions on the walls, invoking his curiosity. - Ros quickly identifies the inscriptions as a puzzle that requires solving to proceed. - Jack and Molly search for clues, displaying teamwork. - Dan's curious and restless nature leads him to trigger a hidden switch, opening a secret pathway. *Scene 3: The Undercroft Secrets* - Descending the staircase, they enter a torchlit undercroft with hidden dangers. - Molly uplifts the group with her serenity and positive outlook. - They encounter a room with traps and Ros deduces the pattern to navigate safely. - With Jack's agility, Molly’s encouragement, Dan’s energy, and Ros’s intellect, they make it through safely towards the chamber holding the Evermoor Sapphire. *Scene 4: The Guardian Encounter* - A spectral figure, the Guardian, appears to challenge them as they reach for the sapphire. - Jack uses his charm to communicate their peaceful intentions to the Guardian. - Ros steps forward, showing confidence and asserting their quest for adventure, not greed. - The Guardian puts them to the test with a riddle, which they solve together. - Molly's optimism, Dan’s laughter and light-heartedness, and Jack’s charisma support Ros’s smarts in answering the riddle. *Scene 5: The Sapphire’s Secret* - The Guardian acknowledges their unique qualities and reveals the true value of the sapphire: a lesson in friendship and courage. - Molly reaches out to the sapphire, signifying the intangible reward of their journey. - They leave the mansion enriched with experience and a stronger friendship, ready for future adventures. *The End*"},{"prompt":"","completion":"It seems like there might be something missing from your message.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"What is augmentation of LLMs","completion":"The augmentation of Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the process of enhancing or extending their capabilities through various methods. Augmentation aims to improve language models' performance, accuracy, contextual understanding, and reliability. This can be achieved through several techniques or approaches, such as: 1. **Data Augmentation**: Increasing the diversity of the training data by artificially creating new training examples, which could involve paraphrasing, translation, or generating synthetic data. This helps the model generalize better to different inputs. 2. **Model Ensembling**: Combining multiple models to improve performance. For example, predictions from several language models could be averaged or voted on to produce a more accurate output. 3. **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tuning models on specific tasks or domains after pretraining on a large corpus of general data. This allows the model to adapt to specialized terminology and stylistic elements relevant to a particular field. 4. **Multimodal Training**: Incorporating other forms of data such as images, audio, or structured information alongside text to create models that can understand and generate content across different data types. 5. **Knowledge Enhancement**: Injecting external knowledge into LLMs, such as facts from a knowledge base, allowing them to provide more accurate and context-aware responses, especially for questions about real-world information. 6. **Interactive Learning**: Allowing LLMs to learn from interactions with users in real-time, adjusting to user feedback or corrections to improve over time. 7. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Integrating human feedback during or after the training process to refine the model's outputs and reduce errors or biases. 8. **Adversarial Training**: Exposing the model to challenging scenarios or inputs deliberately designed to trick or confuse it, to improve its robustness against such attempts. The ultimate goal of augmenting LLMs is to create AI systems that are more useful, reliable, and effective across a wider range of applications and contexts. Each augmentation method serves to address specific limitations of the existing models and is an active area of research within the field of natural language processing (NLP) and AI."},{"prompt":"merhaba","completion":"Merhaba!

Together, they formed a circle of camaraderie that was the envy of many. Let’s embark on one of their escapades, following the bold Jack, jovial Dan, brilliant Ros, and ebullient Molly through a page of their storybook lives. **Scene 1: The Secret Map** *Interior – The Old Library of Aventura – Early Morning* The echo of footsteps reverberated through the maze of bookshelves as the group convened at their favorite marble table, the morning light casting golden hues over the dust-laden tomes. Jack, with his charming smirk, unfurled an ancient map dotted with cryptic symbols. \\"Guys, check this out,\\" he said, his eyes sparkling with the hint of adventure. Dan bounced on his heels, barely containing his excitement. \\"Is that the legendary Map of Eldoria?\\" he blurted, grinning ear to ear. Ros, her crimson hair tied up in a rigorous bun, leaned over the map, her analytical gaze dissecting every inch. \\"It seems genuine,\\" she commented with calm authority. \\"But it won't be an easy quest.\\" Molly clapped her hands together, her voice sunshine itself, \\"But imagine the stories we'll tell!

Her laughter infused the air with warmth, bolstering her friends' spirits. **Scene 3: The Riddle of the Sphinx** *Exterior – Sphinx's Clearing – Sunset* Before them loomed the great Sphinx, its riddle a gateway to their prize. The air was thick with the anticipation of twilight mysteries. Ros stepped forth, her intellect her sword, while the others held their breath. The Sphinx's voice was like gravel and silk, \\"Speak my riddle, ye seeker of truth: I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?\\" A contemplative silence fell, but it was Ros who smiled, her voice strong, \\"An echo.\\" A rumbling chuckle emerged from the stone creature as the path before them opened. **Scene 4: The Treasure Chamber** *Interior – Hidden Cave – Night* Gleaming jewels and gold met their eyes, but it was the Tome of Wisdom, aglow with an ethereal light, that held their attention. Jack's hand brushed the tome, a whisper of awe in his voice. \\"We did it…\\" Dan let out a triumphant whoop, darting around the chamber with giddy energy. \\"We're rich in spirit and adventure!\\" Ros nodded, pride evident in her posture. \\"The knowledge in this tome will benefit Aventura.\\" Molly's sincere smile captured the joy of their unity. \\"It's our shared moments that are the true treasure.\\" **Scene 5: The Celebration** *Exterior – Aventura Square – Dawn* As Aventura's citizens awakened, they were greeted by a feast in the square. Jack, Dan, Ros, and Molly were hailed as heroes, their tale an inspiration. The friends exchanged glances, their bond fortified by the trial, a silent promise that this was but one of the many journeys they would share. *Fade to the rising sun over Aventura, the promise of endless stories yet to unfold.* And so the tale of Jack, Dan, Ros, and Molly became legend, a testament to the magic found in friendship and the unyielding quest for knowledge and joy."},{"prompt":"bu yazmış olduğun hikayeyi aynı sahneler olarak düşün ve her bir sahneyi madde olarak yaz","completion":"**Scene 1: The Secret Map** 1.

Write the Python code","completion":"To calculate how many 6-digit numbers contain exactly 3 different digits, we can follow this approach: 1. Choose 3 different digits from the 10 possible digits (from 0 to 9). However, zero cannot be the first digit of the 6-digit number, so we have to account for this. 2. Arrange these 3 digits into a 6-digit number by considering the total number of permutations where each of the three chosen digits appears at least once. Let's calculate it: \`\`\`python from itertools import permutations, combinations # Step 1: Choose 3 different digits, 0 cannot be the first digit # For the first digit, we have 9 choices (1-9) # For the remaining 2 digits, we have 9 choices including 0 first_digit_choices = 9 remaining_digit_combinations = combinations(range(10), 2) # Choose 2 from 0-9 total_count = 0 for combo in remaining_digit_combinations: # Consider cases where the first digit is part of the combo and when it is not for first_digit in range(1, 10): # The first digit cannot be 0 if first_digit in combo: # We have 3 distinct digits, now we count the permutations # 6-digit number with no restriction on where each digit can be perms = [p for p in permutations([first_digit] + list(combo) * 2, 6) if p[0] != 0] else: # For cases where the first digit is not part of the combo chosen # We include the first digit 3 times to account for permutations # where every digit appears at least once perms = [p for p in permutations([first_digit] * 3 + list(combo) * 2, 6) if p[0] != 0] total_count += len(set(perms)) # Remove duplicates (if any) and add to total print(f\\"The number of 6-digit numbers containing exactly 3 different digits is: {total_count}\\") \`\`\` The above code chooses two distinct digits in addition to the first digit and ensures that we generate 6-digit numbers where no non-leading zeros are involved. It then generates permutations of these digits (multiplied to make up six numbers) and counts the unique permutations that form valid 6-digit numbers with exactly three distinct digits, not starting with zero.

İdeal parametre ayarlarını belirlerken dikkate alınması gereken bazı faktörler şunlardır: **1. İletişim mesafesi:** Uzun bir menzile ihtiyacınız varsa, düşük veri hızı ve yüksek verici gücü seçebilirsiniz. **2. Veri hızı:** Yüksek veri hızı, daha kısa mesafeler için tercih edilirken, düşük veri hızı daha uzun menzillere ulaşmaya yardımcı olur. **3. Güç tüketimi:** Düşük güç modu, pilli cihazlarda veya enerji tasarrufu gerektiren uygulamalarda önemlidir. **4. Kanal bant genişliği:** Daha geniş bir bant genişliği, daha yüksek veri hızlarını destekler, ancak paraziti artırabilir ve menzili azaltabilir. **5. Kodlama:** Hata düzeltme ve gelişmiş kodlama teknikleri, parazitli veya zayıf sinyal koşullarında iletişimin güvenilirliğini artırabilir. **6. Modülasyon:** Çeşitli modülasyon türleri (örneğin, FSK, GFSK, OOK, LoRa) farklı uygulama ihtiyaçlarını karşılar. LoRa E32 433T30D için örnek bir ayar kombinasyonu şu şekilde olabilir: - Çalışma Modu: Normal mod veya Wake-up mod (enerji tasarrufu için) - Verici Gücü: Maksimum güç (20 dBm) - Frekans: 433 MHz bandı içinde, yerel düzenlemelere uygun bir alt bant - Air Data Rate: 2.4 kbps (uzun mesafe için ideal) - Kanal Bant Genişliği: 125 kHz - Modülasyon: LoRa™ modülasyonu - Spreading Factor (SF): SF12, menzili artırır ama veri hızını düşürür - Coding Rate (CR): 4/5 or 4/6, hata düzeltme yeteneğini artırır Herhangi bir değişiklik yapmadan önce, kullanım kılavuzundaki talimatları takip etmeli ve modülünüzün donanım sürümüne ve yazılım sürümüne göre uygun parametre ayarlamalarını yapmalısınız. Ayrıca, yerel düzenlemeler ve frekans tahsisleri gibi yasal kısıtlamaları da göz önünde bulundurmalısınız.

Sutton 和 Andrew G. Barto 提出并定义了option的概念。一个option由三部分组成： 1. **策略（Policy）**：当选中该option时，它定义了在内部状态下应该采取的动作。 2. **终止条件（Termination Condition）**：它定义了option什么时候结束，可以是确定性的也可以是概率性的。 3. **起始集合（Initiation Set）**：这定义了option可以在哪些状态下被启动。 Options 允许agent在学习期间执行更长期的规划，通过构造序列动作的抽象来执行更复杂的行为。例如，在一个迷宫寻路任务中，一个option可能代表从迷宫的一个关键点到另一个关键点的最佳路径。这样agent就可以学习在这些关键点之间的导航策略，而不是在整个迷宫中每个单一位置上的移动策略。 Option discovery可以通过多种方式来实现，其中几种流行的方法包括： - **基于启发式的方法**：使用先验知识或对环境的理解来定义options。 - **基于聚类的方法**：对状态空间或状态-动作轨迹进行聚类，将不同的聚类中心或路径作为options。 - **基于动态规划的方法**：学习状态空间的瓶颈状态（bottleneck states），然后围绕这些瓶颈状态创造options。 - **基于图搜索的方法**：将状态空间看作图，通过识别图中的关键节点或边来创造options。 在许多情况下，option discovery与层次化强化学习（Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, HRL）紧密相关，其中HRL旨在通过构建不同层次的决策来解决复杂的决策问题。该领域中其他重要概念包括状态抽象（state abstraction）、临时抽象（temporal abstraction）以及策略抽象（policy abstraction）。 值得注意的是，有效的option discovery可以极大地提升RL系统的性能，在复杂问题上取得人类专家级别或超过人类专家级别的成果。然而，如何在不同的环境和任务中高效地发现有益的options，依然是一个活跃的研究领域。"}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},F={class:"card-container"},I={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],R={key:0},M={key:1};function O(n,e,h,m,o,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",F,[(a(!0),i(w,null,x(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",I,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
