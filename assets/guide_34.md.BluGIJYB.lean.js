How can such a circuit be obtained by decomposing an (a times b) rectangle into squares from problem (60598)?","completion":"The problem requires us to build an electrical circuit from unit resistances such that the total resistance of the circuit is equal to the rational number frac{a}{b}. We will achieve this by using a method analogous to the division of a rectangle with dimensions a times b into squares. Let's go through the steps in a detailed manner. 1. **Starting with a Rational Number**: Given the rational number frac{a}{b}, where a and b are positive integers, we aim to realize this value as the total resistance of an electrical circuit composed of unit resistances. 2. **Conversion to Continued Fraction**: Convert the rational number frac{a}{b} into its continued fraction representation. A continued fraction for a rational number frac{a}{b} can be expressed in the form: [ frac{a}{b} = [a_0; a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n] ] where a_0, a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n are non-negative integers. 3. **Constructing the Continued Fraction Example**: Consider, for example, the rational number frac{71}{31}. Its continued fraction representation is: [ frac{71}{31} = [2; 3, 2, 4] ] This implies: [ 71/31 = 2 + frac{1}{3 + frac{1}{2 + frac{1}{4}}} ] 4. **Corresponding Graphical Representation**: In the graphical representation, each term in the continued fraction corresponds to the side length of the squares used to subdivide the rectangle a times b. In our example, the rectangle is 31 times 71. Illustrating this, we would see a series of nested squares as depicted below: ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_388b3f8bbd0a17840215g-18.jpg?height=626&width=1412&top_left_y=1596&top_left_x=332) 5. **Mapping to Electrical Circuit**: Each square in the graphical representation corresponds to a unit resistance in the circuit. To achieve a total resistance of frac{a}{b} in the electrical circuit: - Connect the resistances corresponding to horizontal partitions (squares) in series. - Connect the resistances corresponding to vertical partitions (squares) in parallel. This approach effectively models the continued fraction decomposition of the rational number frac{a}{b} into an equivalent electrical circuit of unit resistances. 6. **Constructing the Circuit**: Using our example of frac{71}{31} = [2; 3, 2, 4]: - The first term '2' implies two unit resistances connected in series. - The next term '3' implies three unit resistances connected in parallel, which yields a total resistance of frac{1}{3}. - Combining these using the series-parallel combinations for each continued fraction term results in the complete circuit. Here is the illustrative diagram of the resultant circuit: ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_388b3f8bbd0a17840215g-18.jpg?height=377&width=761&top_left_y=2387&top_left_x=657) 7. **Conclusion**: This method showcases how to realize the given rational number frac{a}{b} as the total resistance of an electrical circuit using unit resistances, by leveraging the continuous fraction representation and corresponding the construction of the circuit based on the graphical subdivision of rectangles into squares. For the proof part of the problem, consider that for any infinite continued fraction [a_0; a_1, ldots, a_n, ldots], there exists a limit alpha which is an irrational number. By the properties of continued fractions from problem 60606, this alpha can be uniquely represented as such an infinite continued fraction, ensuring that the approximation converges to the original irrational number through successive finite continued fractions.

Suppose we place the numbers 1, 2, and 3 on this diagonal. - The positions on the main diagonal are (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3). 3. **Implication on the Remaining Cells:** - The cells (1,3), (3,1), and (3,3) will now have only one number left, which is 4 (since 1, 2, and 3 are already on the main diagonal). 4. **Effect on the Second Diagonal:** - Consider the second diagonal (from the top right to the bottom left), specifically the positions (1,3), (2,2), and (3,1). - We previously filled (1,3) and (3,1) with the number 4. - Since the number at the intersection of both diagonals (i.e., (2,2)) is also on the other diagonal, it must be different from 4 because we need distinct numbers. 5. **Conflict and Conclusion:** - As per our assumption, we see that the placement of these numbers violates the condition since we can't maintain distinct numbers in the diagonals while simultaneously keeping rows and columns distinct. - Therefore, no possible arrangement will satisfy all conditions (rows, columns, and diagonals having different number arrangements with three unique numbers).

We are told that the period of A's investment is some multiple of the period of B's investment, so we can write: [ T_A = k times T_B ] where ( k ) is the multiple. The profit share in a partnership is proportional to the product of the investment and the time period of the investment. So, the profit share of A and B can be written as: [ text{Profit}_A = I_A times T_A ] [ text{Profit}_B = I_B times T_B ] The total profit is given as Rs 31500, and B's share of the profit is Rs 4500.

Let (m) be the smallest number among the chosen (k) numbers. To ensure that none of the chosen numbers have the required differences, we perform the following: 4. Consider the set ({1, 2, 3, ldots, 3n}). 5. Construct the differences by removing (m) and numbers from (m + n + 1) to (m + 2n - 1): - Therefore, if these numbers are eliminated from the set ({1, ldots, 3n}), let's denote the remaining set by (E). 6.

Given that selection of (674 = n + 2) numbers can be arranged in such a way that no two numbers differ by (n+1) or (2n-1), we conclude that our selections of pairs will eventually lead to a contradiction due to the difference properties. 8. Hence, if we select fewer than 674 numbers, it is possible to find a valid pair that meets the criteria.

Basically, P is equidistant from A and B, hence the distance PA = PB equals the radius. The distance PA can be calculated as follows [ PA = d_{(0,t),(-1,0)} = sqrt{(0 - (-1))^2 + (t - 0)^2} = sqrt{1 + t^2}. ] Thus, the radius of the circle centered at P is sqrt{1 + t^2}. 2. **Extreme cases of radii when ( t = 0 ) and ( t = 1 ):** - When t=0, P = (0,0) and the radius is sqrt{1+0^2} = 1. - When t=1, P = (0,1) and the radius is sqrt{1+1^2} = sqrt{2}.

It takes Darcy a total of 25 more minutes to commute to work by walking than it takes her to commute to work by riding the train. What is the value of x?","completion":"First, let's calculate the time it takes Darcy to walk to work. Since she walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour and the distance is 1.5 miles, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time walking = 1.5 miles / 3 mph = 0.5 hours To convert this time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): Time walking in minutes = 0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes Next, let's calculate the time it takes Darcy to ride the train to work, not including the additional x minutes. Since the train travels at a rate of 20 miles per hour and the distance is the same, we have: Time riding the train = 1.5 miles / 20 mph = 0.075 hours Again, we convert this time into minutes: Time riding the train in minutes = 0.075 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 4.5 minutes Now, we know that walking takes 25 more minutes than riding the train, including the additional x minutes. So we can set up the following equation: Time walking = Time riding the train + x + 25 minutes Substituting the values we have: 30 minutes = 4.5 minutes + x + 25 minutes Now, we solve for x: 30 minutes = 29.5 minutes + x x = 30 minutes - 29.5 minutes x = 0.5 minutes Therefore, the value of x is boxed{0.5} minutes."},{"prompt":"Let S be the set of all real numbers x such that 0 le x le 2016 pi and sin x < 3 sin(x/3) . The set S is the union of a finite number of disjoint intervals. Compute the total length of all these intervals.","completion":"1. We start with the given inequality sin x < 3 sin(x/3). To analyze this, we use the triple angle identity for sine: [ sin x = 3 sin(x/3) - 4 sin^3(x/3) ] Therefore, the inequality becomes: [ 3 sin(x/3) - 4 sin^3(x/3) < 3 sin(x/3) ] 2. Simplifying the inequality, we subtract 3 sin(x/3) from both sides: [ 3 sin(x/3) - 4 sin^3(x/3) - 3 sin(x/3) < 0 ] [ -4 sin^3(x/3) < 0 ] 3. Dividing both sides by -4 (which reverses the inequality): [ sin^3(x/3) > 0 ] Since sin^3(x/3) > 0, it implies: [ sin(x/3) > 0 ] 4. The function sin(x/3) is positive in the intervals where x/3 is in the first and second quadrants of the unit circle, i.e., 0 < x/3 < pi and 2pi < x/3 < 3pi, and so on. Therefore, x must be in the intervals: [ 0 < x < 3pi, quad 6pi < x < 9pi, quad 12pi < x < 15pi, quad ldots ] 5. Each interval where sin(x/3) > 0 has a length of 3pi. Since x ranges from 0 to 2016pi, we need to determine how many such intervals fit within this range. The period of sin(x/3) is 6pi, so we divide 2016pi by 6pi to find the number of periods: [ frac{2016pi}{6pi} = 336 ] 6. Each period of 6pi contains one interval of length 3pi where sin(x/3) > 0.

Each character in the sequence can either be \\"a\\" or \\"u\\". 3. **Counting valid words**: - The number of sequences of length 1 is (2^1 = 2) (i.e., \\"a\\" and \\"u\\"). - The number of sequences of length 2 is (2^2 = 4). - Continue this process up to sequences of length 13: (2^{13} = 8192). 4. **Sum of all valid sequences**: The total number of sequences from length 1 to 13 is the sum of the geometric series: [ 2^1 + 2^2 + ldots + 2^{13} ] This can be computed using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: [ S = a frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} ] Here, (a = 2), (r = 2), and (n = 13): [ S = 2 left( frac{2^{13} - 1}{2 - 1} right) = 2 (8191) = 2^14 - 2 ] So, [ S = 2^{14} - 2 = 16384 - 2 = 16382 ] 5. **Combination of words**: Due to the problem's constraints, combining any two valid words results in an invalid sequence that is not a word in the language. This ensures that no word of length greater than 13 is considered valid, such as any concatenation of two smaller valid words. 6. **Ensuring optimal solution**: To maximize the number of valid words while ensuring none of their concatenations is a valid word, the maximum possible number of valid words corresponds to the sequences where the sequence length is at least 7 and at most 13.

The profit from tomatoes is 0.01x million yuan (since 10,000 per hectare = 0.01 million yuan per hectare), from green peppers is 0.015 times 2x = 0.03x million yuan, and from potatoes is 0.02 times (100 - 3x) million yuan.

This signifies that there are no three mutually acquainted participants forming a trio or clique of size three. - Any bipartition of the participants results in at least one piece containing an edge. This property alludes to the fact that the graph is not bipartite (it cannot be colored using two colors without having adjacent colors). 3. **Assume no odd-length cycle:** - Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there are no odd-length cycles in G. If G contains no odd-length cycles, it should be bipartite. 4. **Show G is bipartite:** - To show G is bipartite, color vertex s_0 with one color (say, red). - Color all adjacent vertices with a different color (blue). - Proceed recursively, coloring each vertex's neighbors alternately with red or blue. 5. **Reach contradiction with bipartite assumption:** - If G is bipartite, partition the graph into 2 color classes. From the problem statement, one color class necessarily contains an edge, showing a pair of vertices (students) know each other. - This contradicts the property that the graph must have no odd-length cycles, showing G cannot be bipartite. 6. **Identify an odd-length cycle:** - Since G cannot be bipartite, G has at least one odd-length cycle. - Let this minimal odd-length cycle have a length of 2k + 1 where k geq 2 (since no triangles exist). 7. **Analyze vertices outside cycle:** - Consider a vertex outside this cycle. This vertex cannot connect to more than 2 vertices within the cycle, as connecting to more vertices would form a smaller odd-length cycle, which contradicts the minimality assumption. 8. **Degree analysis:** - The sum of degrees of vertices in the 2k + 1 cycle can at most associate with n times k. The degree sum condition implies: [ sum_{i} deg(s_i) leq n times k ] - Thus, at least one vertex has degree at most: [ deg(s_i) leq frac{2n}{2k+1} ] 9. **Select minimal k:** - With k ge 2, the ratio reaches its largest when k is minimal, namely, k = 2: [ frac{2n}{2k+1} leq frac{2n}{5} ] **Conclusion:** Thus, we have shown that there exists at least one participant who knows at most frac{2n}{5} other students. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Given a in mathbb{R}, the function f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + (a 3)x has a derivative denoted as f'(x).

First, we need to prove that the quadrilateral ABCD is an isosceles trapezoid where AD parallel BC. We assume for the sake of contradiction that AD nparallel BC. - Draw a line through vertex B parallel to AD and let it intersect the circle at point C_1. - Since the arcs between parallel chords are equal, the corresponding chords must also be equal. - Given that B, C, and C_1 are on the same side of line AD, it follows that point C_1 must coincide with point C. - Hence, AD is indeed parallel to BC. Thus, quadrilateral ABCD is an isosceles trapezoid with bases AD and BC and legs AB and CD of equal length, i.e., AB = CD = 5. 2. Next, we denote the perpendicular from B to AD as BK. Because BK < AB, quadrilateral ABCD must be a trapezoid with AD and BC as the bases. 3.

(log_{2}{0.6}): Because 0.6 is less than 1 (and greater than 0), and we are using a logarithm with base 2 which is greater than 1, the logarithm of a number between 0 and 1 with respect to a base greater than 1 is negative. Thus, (log_{2}{0.6} < 0). 3. (log_{3}{pi}): The number (pi) is greater than 3 (since (pi approx 3.14)).

Part a: Prove that (V_1 ne V_2) 1. **Define the Key Variables**: - Let ( R ) be the radius of the base of the cone. - Let ( m ) be the height of the cone. - Let ( r ) be the radius of the inscribed sphere. 2. **Cone Slant Height and Cylinder Dimensions**: - The slant height of the cone can be calculated as ( L = sqrt{R^2 + m^2} ). - The radius of the cylinder is ( r ), and its height is ( 2r ) because the cylinder's height equals the diameter of the inscribed sphere. 3. **Conduct the Geometry Analysis**: - The cross-section of the cone is an isosceles triangle, and the largest circle that fits inside is the incircle. - The radius of the incircle ( r ) is given by: [ r = frac{R m}{R + sqrt{R^2 + m^2}} ] - Rearranging this, we get: [ r sqrt{R^2 + m^2} = R(m - r) ] [ R^2 = frac{r^2 m}{m - 2r} ] 4. **Volume of Cone and Cylinder**: - The volume of the cone ( V_1 ) is: [ V_1 = frac{1}{3} pi R^2 m ] - The volume of the cylinder ( V_2 ) is: [ V_2 = pi r^2 (2r) = 2 pi r^3 ] 5. **Establish Ratio of Volumes**: - The ratio of the volumes ( k ) is calculated as: [ k = frac{V_1}{V_2} = frac{frac{1}{3} pi R^2 m}{2 pi r^3} = frac{R^2 m}{6 r^3} ] - Substituting ( R^2 ) from the relationship above, we get: [ k = frac{frac{r^2 m}{m - 2r} m}{6 r^3} = frac{m^2}{6r (m - 2r)} ] 6. **Solve for ( r )**: - Consider ( 6 times k times r (m - 2r) = m^2 ). - Rearrange to form a quadratic equation in ( r ): [ 12 k r^2 - 6 k m r + m^2 = 0 ] - Using the quadratic formula ( r = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ): [ r = frac{m}{12k} left( 3k pm sqrt{3k(3k - 4)} right) ] 7. **Ensure Positive Discriminant**: - For real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative: [ 3k(3k - 4) geq 0 ] - This implies ( k geq frac{4}{3} ). 8. **Conclusion Part a**: - Since ( k = 1 ) does not satisfy ( k geq frac{4}{3} ), it is impossible for ( V_1 = V_2 ): [ boxed{V_1 ne V_2} ] Part b: Determine the minimum ( k ) and construct the angle 1. **Determine ( k_{min} )**: - From the above, ( k geq frac{4}{3} ). - Therefore, the minimum value is ( k = frac{4}{3} ). 2. **Calculate Value of ( r ) for ( k = frac{4}{3} )**: - Substituting ( k = frac{4}{3} ) into the quadratic formula gives: [ r = frac{m}{12 cdot frac{4}{3}} left( 3 cdot frac{4}{3} pm sqrt{3 cdot frac{4}{3} left( 3 cdot frac{4}{3} - 4 right)} right) ] [ r = frac{m}{16} left( 4 pm sqrt{4 - 4} right) ] [ r = frac{m}{16} cdot 4 = frac{m}{4} ] 3. **Geometric Construction for the Angle**: - The distance from the cone’s apex to the center of the sphere is ( m - r = frac{3m}{4} ). - To find the desired angle, draw tangent lines from a point ( 3r ) away from the center of the circle. The angle bisected by these tangents gives the angle between the cone generator and axis. - Let's denote the half-angle by ( alpha ). 4. **Verify Using Trigonometric Identity**: - Using trigonometric relationships, the angle half-angle formula for tangent is: [ tan(alpha) = frac{r}{3r} = frac{1}{3} ] - We can find the angle such that (tan(alpha) = frac{1}{3}). 5. **Final Answer**: - The smallest ( k ) is: [ boxed{k = frac{4}{3}} ]"},{"prompt":"a certain business school class, p students are accounting majors, q students are finance majors, r students are marketing majors, and s students are strategy majors.

What is the maximum (k) such that, after removing any rook from the board, there will be at least one marked cell that is no longer under attack?","completion":"To understand the problem, let's consider the constraints and the conditions given for arranging k rooks on a 10 times 10 chessboard. The goal is to determine the maximum value of k such that, after removing any rook, there is at least one cell that is no longer under attack by any rooks. Let's analyze this step-by-step. 1. **Initial Observation**: - Each rook can attack all cells in its row and column. - We need to place the rooks in such a way that, upon removing any rook, at least one cell it previously attacked becomes unmarked, meaning no other rook is attacking that cell. 2. **Case 1: One rook per row or column**: - Let's first consider placing rooks such that each column has exactly one rook. Thus, all cells on the chessboard are under attack. - If we remove any rook, the column it was in will no longer be under attack by any rooks. Hence, no row will be free of attack, and the constraint is not satisfied this way. - Therefore, each column (or equivalently, each row) must contain exactly one rook to cover all cells. This gives us k leq 10. (As identical logic holds for rows, k leq 10). 3. **Case 2: Ensuring removal of any rook leaves unmarked cell**: - Suppose there exists a row without any rook and a column without any rook. The cell at the intersection of this row and column will not be under attack. - This configuration implies that there's some row-direction or column-direction without a rook. 4. **Generalizing this to find maximum k**: - If for each rook either its row or column is unique to it (i.e., no other rook is placed in the same row or column if we place a new rook), then, upon removal of any rook, some unique column or row becomes free. - To maintain the balance, let's consider marking rows and columns distinctively. Suppose only 8 rows and 8 columns are marked with rooks. In this setup, we can uniquely place up to 8 rooks in such a manner. - If we attempt to mark more rows or more columns, e.g., 9 such marking would imply each row or each column uniquely housing a single rook. Extending this scenario logically, we get a max configuration of k=8+8=16 rooks satisfying the stated conditions. 5. **Conclusion**: - From the careful analysis, ensuring after removal of any rook the constraints still hold true, the maximum number of rooks k can be determined to be up to 16. # Final Answer: boxed{16}"},{"prompt":"Given rectangle (R_1) with one side measuring (4) inches and area (32) square inches.

Consider two squares mathbf{Q} and mathbf{Q}' that overlap, sharing a common center O. Rotate square mathbf{Q} around O by an acute angle theta to align it with mathbf{Q}'. 2. The intersection of these two squares mathbf{Q} and mathbf{Q}' creates an octagon mathbf{C}, as indicated in the problem. 3. First, observe that both squares individually are symmetric with respect to a 90-degree rotation about their center O. Consequently, if we rotate both mathbf{Q} and mathbf{Q}' by 90^circ, they map to themselves. 4. Since the intersection mathbf{C} inherits the rotational symmetry of the squares, mathbf{C} must also map onto itself with a 90^circ rotation around O. This symmetry suggests that mathbf{C} is centrally symmetric and possesses properties of an equiangular octagon. 5. Let's delve further into the geometric structure: - Consider one edge of mathbf{C}, say t_1. After a 90^circ rotation around O, this edge maps to t_2, again a tangent line to mathbf{C}, and similarly, t_3 and t_4 are the tangents derived from further 90^circ rotations of t_1. - These four tangents t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4 create a grid that aligns with the symmetry of mathbf{C}, forming a supporting square grid due to perpendicular pairs and equal distances. 6. The common intersection mathbf{C} between the rotated square mathbf{Q}' and the original square mathbf{Q} remains a convex polygon due to the rotational and symmetric properties. 7. Since each side of mathbf{C} corresponds to segments lying within orientation preserving properties of the two squares, mathbf{C} is bounded within the supporting tangents arranged at 90^circ intervals - reaffirming the structure of the octagon. 8. A precise argument involves constructing an auxiliary geometric figure by identifying the coordinates of the points C_k forming vertices of mathbf{C} and analyzing their behavior under the consecutive rotations/translations mentioned. Due to symmetry, the resulting figure preserves a combinational structure of square sub-tangents. In essence, the detailed arguments elucidate that due to the symmetrical properties of the intersecting squares, the resulting shape mathbf{C} is indeed an equiangular octagon continually maintaining sub-square tangent congruence properties upon each 90^circ shift, allowing it to be tessellated with squares.

Imagine the right-angle shape and how it could be divided equally. Visualize a grid that can superimpose the shape ensuring equal area subdivisions. 3. **Implementing the Cuts**: To verify if the cuts result in equal parts, we must align the cuts with symmetry. A possible way is to draw two lines along each axis and two lines that follow the shape, thus dividing it into four equal parts. 4. **Detailed Cuts**: Using the square grid visual representation: - Draw a vertical line from the top middle edge downward, intersecting the bottom. - Likewise, draw a horizontal line from the left middle edge toward the right, intersecting the right edge. - Ensure each part looks symmetrical, forming four smaller \\"L\\" shapes within the larger \\"L.\\" 5. **Visual Confirmation**: Refer to the second diagram (indicated in the provided answer). - The cuts should be similar to the example shown in the second image where the \\"corner\\" (L-shaped) plate is divided by the central vertical and horizontal lines creating four smaller equally sized L-shaped areas. # Conclusion: By following these steps, we ensure the ice plate is evenly divided into four equal parts satisfying the criteria.

If you meant to find the value of q such that f(f(q)) = 210, we can solve for q: f(f(q)) = 210 Let's denote f(q) as y for simplicity, so we have: f(y) = 210 Now we solve for y: 3y - 3 = 210 3y = 210 + 3 3y = 213 y = 213 / 3 y = 71 Now we know that f(q) = y, and we have found y = 71. So we solve for q: f(q) = 71 3q - 3 = 71 3q = 71 + 3 3q = 74 q = 74 / 3 q = 24.666... Therefore, the value of q for which f(f(q)) = boxed{210} is approximately 24.666...

Assume if (ak) and (bk) have the same residue modulo 101 for (0 leq a < b leq 100). Then, [ (b-a)k equiv 0 pmod{101} ] which implies 101 divides ( (b-a)k ). Given (1 leq k leq 100) and (1 leq b-a leq 100), it's impossible for (101) to divide ((b-a)k). Thus, each term yields a distinct residue. 4. **Extend the sequences considering periodicity:** We extend the sequence to include terms shifted by 101, namely: [ mathcal{P}_k: 0, k, 2k, ldots, 100k, 100k + 101, 99k + 101, ldots, k + 101, 101 ] Therefore, all residues modulo 202 of numbers in (mathcal{P}_k) are distinct. If two distinct numbers in (mathcal{P}_k) yield identical residues modulo 202, they must also be identical modulo 101, which they are not. 5. **Arrive at maximum number considering constraints:** Since each airline must operate at least 201 flights (connections), given that they cover all cities, the total number of flights required is: [ frac{202 cdot 201}{2} = 20301 ] It means the number of airlines must be at most: [ leftlceil frac{20301}{201} rightrceil = 101 ] 6. **Construct the solution for 101 airlines:** If every set associated with (k) connects any city to every other city with flights among these uniquely covering the connections modulo constraints and ensuring distinctness, we can extend the connectivity. Since the sequences span the entire residue set modulo 202, combining up to 100 airlines handled different partitions.

Denote these intersections such that they divide the rectangle into four smaller rectangles. Enhance the rectangle segment with vertex A such that P lies on the BD diagonal. 2. **Observation and Claim**: We will show that the area of the sub-rectangle with vertex A and diagonal AP^* is at most half of the area of triangle ABD.

Consider the orthocentric tetrahedron (ABCD) and the edges (AB) and (CD). Since these edges are perpendicular to each other, it is possible to place a unique plane through each that is perpendicular to the other edge. Let (T_1) represent the intersection of this plane with (CD), and (T_2) represent the intersection with (AB). Consequently, the line segment (T_1T_2) lies within both planes, making it their line of intersection. 2. Each line in the plane (ABT_1), including (T_1T_2), is perpendicular to (CD). Similarly, each line in the plane (CDT_2), including (T_1T_2), is perpendicular to (AB). Hence, (T_1T_2) is perpendicular to both (AB) and (CD), making it the normal transversal. The points (T_1) and (T_2) correspond to the foot of the altitudes from vertices (A) and (B) to edge (CD) and from vertices (C) and (D) to edge (AB), respectively. 3. The above statement holds for any pair of opposite edges due to the lack of any distinguishing property between the edges in an orthocentric tetrahedron. Thus, the proof generalizes for all opposite pairs of edges. 4. To address the first assertion of the problem for a single pair of opposite edges, consider the height (AM_1) from vertex (A) to the opposite face (BCD). Since (AM_1) is perpendicular to the plane (BCD), and consequently to (CD), it belongs to the plane (ABT_1). Similarly, the height (BM_2) from vertex (B) intersects (ABT_1). Therefore, the common intersection point (M) of heights (AM_1) and (BM_2) lies on (T_1T_2). 5. By symmetry, the common intersection (M) also lies on the plane (CDT_2), as it results from the heights drawn from vertices (C) and (D). Consequently, the intersection point of (T_1T_2) with the heights of faces (ACD) and (BCD) confirms that (M) is the orthocenter of tetrahedron (ABCD). Thus, the line (T_1T_2) indeed passes through (M). 6. To validate further, the projections of the normal transversals onto the planes of the faces of the tetrahedron will lie on the altitudes of the respective faces. This proves both assertions: - The normal transversals of the opposite edges pass through the tetrahedron's orthocenter. - The points of intersection of these transversals with the edges are the feet of the altitudes of the respective faces at the tetrahedron's edges. # Conclusion: blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Levi has 5 lemons.

Let's break down the problem step by step. 1. **Initial Setup and Rules:** - Ada and Charles start with 1000 points each. - Ada moves first. - On each turn, a player can either: 1. Replace the number ( k ) on the board with a positive divisor of ( k ) different from 1 and ( k ), gaining 1 point. 2. Replace the number ( k ) on the board with ( k+1 ), losing 1 point. - The game ends when a player has zero points, and that player loses. 2. **Analyzing Small Numbers:** - If ( n = 2 ), Ada can only move to ( 3 ) (since 1 is not allowed), losing 1 point. Charles then moves to ( 4 ), gaining 1 point. This cycle continues, and Ada will eventually lose all her points first. - If ( n = 3 ), Ada can move to ( 4 ) (losing 1 point) or to ( 2 ) (gaining 1 point). If Ada moves to ( 4 ), Charles can move to ( 5 ) (losing 1 point), and the cycle continues. If Ada moves to ( 2 ), Charles can move to ( 3 ), and the cycle continues. 3. **General Strategy:** - Numbers like ( 2, 4, 8 ) are winning positions for the first player because they can force the second player into a losing cycle. - Numbers like ( 3, 5 ) are losing positions for the first player because they force the first player into a cycle where they lose points faster. 4. **Prime Numbers:** - For prime numbers ( p ), if ( p ) is a winning position, then ( 2p ) is a losing position. This is because if ( p ) is winning, then ( 2p + 1 ) is divisible by 3, making it a winning position. - The primes ( 7 ) and ( 13 ) are special cases where the first player can force a win by moving to ( 8 ) or ( 14 ), respectively. 5. **Composite Numbers:** - Composite numbers that are not of the form ( 26, 14, 8, 49, 169, 91 ) are generally winning positions for the first player because they can force the second player into a losing cycle. 6. **Conclusion:** - Charles has a winning strategy for all primes except ( 2, 7, 13 ) and for the numbers ( 8, 14, 26, 49, 91, 169 ).

If the area of the base of a hemisphere is 3, what is the surface area of that hemisphere?","completion":"The base of the hemisphere is a circle, and the area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2. If the area of the base of the hemisphere is 3, we can set this equal to πr^2 to solve for r: 3 = πr^2 To find r, we divide both sides by π: r^2 = 3/π r = √(3/π) Now that we have the radius, we can find the surface area of the hemisphere. The surface area of a full sphere is 4πr^2, so the surface area of a hemisphere (half a sphere) would be half of that, plus the area of the base (which is a circle with area 3). Therefore, the surface area of the hemisphere is: (1/2)(4πr^2) + 3 Substitute the value of r we found: (1/2)(4π(√(3/π))^2) + 3 Simplify the expression: (1/2)(4π(3/π)) + 3 The π in the numerator and denominator cancel out: (1/2)(4*3) + 3 (1/2)(12) + 3 6 + 3 The surface area of the hemisphere is boxed{9} square units."},{"prompt":"A number x is randomly selected from the interval [1, 2].

To calculate the probability P(A), we can use the formula: P(A) = frac{text{Length of A}}{text{Total length}} In this case, the length of event A is 1, and the total length is 3. Therefore, the probability is given by P(A) = frac{1}{3}. To summarize, the probability that a randomly selected number x from the interval [-1, 2] belongs to the interval [0, 1] is boxed{frac{1}{3}}. This problem tests your understanding of geometric probability, which involves measuring the likelihood of an event by comparing relevant geometric measures such as lengths, areas, or volumes. The key is to determine the lengths of the intervals [0, 1] and [-1, 2] on the number line and then use the geometric probability formula to solve the problem. In this context, the geometric measure is the length of the interval, which only depends on the magnitude of the length, not its shape or position. The steps to solving this problem are: 1. Calculate the length of the interval that satisfies the desired condition (event A). In this case, that is the length of the interval [0, 1], which is 1 unit. 2. Calculate the total length of the interval of interest, which is the length of the interval [-1, 2], or 3 units. 3.

A: y=sqrt{1x} B: y=2sqrt{x}x C: y=frac{1}{{{x^2}2x+2}} D: y=sqrt{1{x^2}}|x|","completion":"To determine which of the given functions is a \\"left[0,1right] intersection function\\", we analyze each option step-by-step according to the definition. The intersection of the domain and the range of the function must be left[0,1right]. **Option A: y=sqrt{1-x}** - **Domain**: The function is defined for 1-x geq 0 Rightarrow x leq 1. Thus, the domain is A=left(-infty, 1right]. - **Range**: Since the square root function outputs non-negative values, the range of this function starts from 0 and goes to infinity as x approaches -infty. Thus, the range is B=left[0,+inftyright). - **Intersection**: The intersection of A and B is left[0,1right]. Therefore, option A is a \\"left[0,1right] intersection function\\". **Option B: y=2sqrt{x}-x** - **Domain**: The square root requires x geq 0, so the domain is A=left[0,+inftyright). - **Transformation**: Let t=sqrt{x} geq 0, then y=2t-t^2=-left(t-1right)^2+1. This shows that y achieves its maximum value of 1 when t=1 (x=1) and decreases thereafter, implying y leq 1. - **Range**: From the transformation, it's clear that the range does not exceed 1, so the range is B=left(-infty,1right]. - **Intersection**: The intersection of A and B is left[0,1right]. Therefore, option B is also a \\"left[0,1right] intersection function\\". **Option C: y=frac{1}{{x}^{2}-2x+2}** - **Simplification**: We can rewrite the denominator as (x-1)^{2}+1, which is always greater than 0. - **Range Analysis**: Since (x-1)^2 geq 0, it follows that (x-1)^2+1 geq 1, making 0 < y leq 1. Thus, the range is B=left(0,1right]. - **Domain**: The domain is all real numbers (A=mathbb{R}) because the denominator never equals 0. - **Intersection**: The intersection of A and B is left(0,1right], which does not fully match left[0,1right]. Option C is not a \\"left[0,1right] intersection function\\". **Option D: y=sqrt{1-{x}^{2}}-|x|** - **Domain**: Since 1-x^{2} geq 0, we have -1 leq x leq 1, thus the domain is A=left[-1,1right]. - **Range Calculation**: After some algebra, we find that y^2 ranges from 0 to 1, implying -1 leq y leq 1. Thus, the range is B=left[-1,1right]. - **Intersection**: The intersection of A and B is left[-1,1right].

Below, we provide counterexamples to both parts of the given statement. First Part: Consider a square with side length 5 units, with its vertices at (O_1, O_2, O_3,) and (O_4). 1. Draw circles centered at (O_1) and (O_3) with radius 2 units, and centered at (O_2) and (O_4) with radius 3 units. 2. Let the points where these circles touch be (E, F, G,) and (H). Refer to the figure below: ![Figure 1](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_44e69776373fc76132e5g-1.jpg?height=447&width=442&top_left_y=224&top_left_x=820) - The quadrilateral (E F G H) is formed by the touching points of these circles. The triangles (triangle O_1 E F), (triangle O_2 F G), (triangle O_3 G H), and (triangle O_4 H E) are right triangles with equal legs. - Hence, the quadrilateral (E F G H) is a rectangle with each angle (90^circ). Next, we check if the diagonals of this rectangle are perpendicular to each other: E F = sqrt{2} cdot O_1 F = 2 sqrt{2} neq 3 sqrt{2} = sqrt{2} cdot O_2 F = F G Thus, (E F G H) is not a square, implying that its diagonals are not perpendicular. This contradicts the \\"if and only if\\" statement for the given quadrilateral (O_1 O_2 O_3 O_4). Second Part: To refute the other part, consider the following example: 1. Let (O_1 O_2 O_3 O_4) be a rhombus with each side length (sqrt{frac{2}{3}} + sqrt{2}) units, and an acute angle of (60^circ). 2. Draw circles centered at (O_1) and (O_3) with radius (sqrt{2}) units and centered at (O_2) and (O_4) with radius (sqrt{frac{2}{3}}) units. 3. Let these circles touch at points (E, F, G,) and (H).

In detail: angle H E F = 180^circ - left(angle H E O_1 + angle F E O_2right) = 180^circ - left(frac{180^circ - 60^circ}{2} + frac{180^circ - 120^circ}{2}right) = 90^circ Also, H E = O_1 H = sqrt{2} = 2 cdot sqrt{frac{2}{3}} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 2 E O_2 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = E F Thus, the statement's assumption does not hold. # Conclusion The problem statement is incorrectly posed. The result, however, reminds us of a valid geometric fact: A tangential quadrilateral is a cyclic quadrilateral if and only if the segments connecting opposite tangency points are perpendicular. For the given problem, the specific quadrilateral (O_1 O_2 O_3 O_4), though tangential, does not generally have its inscribed circle's tangency points coinciding with the specified points of the problem.

Verification of these functions is generally left as an exercise, showing they indeed satisfy the original functional equation. Part II: Substitution To find general solutions, consider the function ( g(x) = f(x) - 1 ). This function ( g(x) ) inherits the non-decreasing property of ( f ). The given functional equation becomes: [ f(f(x)) + f(y) = f(x + f(y)) + 1. ] Substitute ( f(x) = g(x) + 1 ): [ g(g(x) + 1) + 1 + g(y) + 1 = g(x + g(y) + 1) + 1 + 1, ] which simplifies to: [ g(g(x) + 1) + g(y) + 2 = g(x + g(y) + 1) + 2. ] Thus it reduces to: [ g(g(x) + 1) + g(y) = g(x + g(y) + 1). ] Lemma: Properties of ( g ) To understand ( g ) better, we analyze further: 1. **At ( x = 0 )**: By substituting ( x = 0 ): [ g(g(0) + 1) + g(y) = g(0 + g(y) + 1), ] resulting in: [ g(g(0) + 1) + g(y) = g(g(y) + 1). ] For this to hold for all ( y ), setting ( y = 0 ) further simplifies to: [ g(g(0) + 1) + g(0) = g(g(0) + 1). ] This necessitates ( g(0) = 0 ). 2. **Proceeding with ( g(0) = 0 )**: [ begin{aligned} P(x, 0): quad & g(g(x) + 1) = g(x + 1), P(0, y): quad & g(1) + g(y) = g(g(y) + 1). end{aligned} ] Thus, combining, we have: [ g(x + 1) = g(x) + g(1). ] This shows ( g ) is additive with a linear step ( g(1) ).

During the inspection, 10 fruits are randomly selected from the box for inspection, and a decision is made whether to inspect the remaining fruits based on the inspection results. Let the probability of each fruit being unqualified be p (0 < p < 1), and whether each fruit is unqualified is independent of each other.

She bought 4/9 square yards of one type of material and 2/3 square yards of another type of material. To add these two amounts together, we need to find a common denominator.

On Thursday, she pulled a certain fraction of the weeds she pulled on Wednesday. We don't know this fraction yet, so let's call it \\"x\\".

So, the number of weeds she pulled on Friday is (x * 75) - 10. 5. In total, she pulled up 120 weeds over the four days. Now, let's write an equation to represent the total number of weeds she pulled: 25 (Tuesday) + 75 (Wednesday) + x * 75 (Thursday) + ((x * 75) - 10) (Friday) = 120 Simplifying the equation: 25 + 75 + 75x + 75x - 10 = 120 100 + 150x - 10 = 120 150x + 90 = 120 150x = 120 - 90 150x = 30 x = 30 / 150 x = 1 / 5 So, the fraction of weeds Sarah pulled on Thursday compared to Wednesday is 1/5.

Now, subtract the two reciprocals: [ frac{1}{a_{n+1}+1} - frac{1}{b_{n+1}+1} = frac{b_n}{(1+a_n)(1+b_n)} - frac{a_n}{(1+a_n)(1+b_n)} ] Simplify the right-hand side: [ frac{b_n - a_n}{(1+a_n)(1+b_n)} = frac{1}{a_n + 1} - frac{1}{b_n + 1} ] 4. We have established the invariance in the sequence: [ frac{1}{a_{n+1} + 1} - frac{1}{b_{n+1} + 1} = frac{1}{a_n + 1} - frac{1}{b_n + 1} ] Utilizing initial conditions: [ frac{1}{a_1 + 1} - frac{1}{b_1 + 1} = frac{1}{1 + 1} - frac{1}{2 + 1} = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6} ] Thus for any (n): [ frac{1}{a_n + 1} - frac{1}{b_n + 1} = frac{1}{6} ] 5. As (b_n > 0): [ frac{1}{b_n + 1} > 0 ] Therefore: [ frac{1}{a_n + 1} = frac{1}{b_n + 1} + frac{1}{6} > frac{1}{6} ] which implies: [ a_n + 1 < 6 ] Thus: [ a_n < 5 ] 6.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Consider the factorials**: Let's examine the values of the factorials involved: - p!: This is the product of all integers from 1 to p. - (p!)^n: This represents the factorial p! raised to the power n. - p^2!: This is the factorial of p^2, i.e., the product of all integers from 1 to p^2. 2. **Factorial Expansion**: Expand the factorial expressions: [ p! = 1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdots p ] [ p^2! = 1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdots p^2 ] We need to show: [ left( p^2 right)! text{ is divisible by } (p!)^{p+1} ] 3. **Using the concept of permutations**: Consider arranging p^2 distinct elements. We can arrange these elements into a p times p table. There are p! ways to arrange p elements, and we need to do this p times for each row, making it (p!)^p ways. However, since there are p rows in each column, and these can be permuted as well, the total number of distinct arrangements (including swapping rows within blocks) results in: [ (p!)^{p+1} ] This indicates that essentially, in a block matrix, we can shuffle columns and rows within each mini-block. 4. **Key Insight**: An important property of factorials is involved in the prime factorization. Each q leq p must appear in any arrangement involving (p!)^{p+1}. 5. **Counting the prime factors**: Let's count the occurrences of any prime q in the factorization of (p!)^{p+1}: [ v_qleft((p!)^{p+1}right) = (p+1) sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{p}{q^k} rightrfloor ] Similarly, for p^2!, we have: [ v_q(p^2!) = sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{p^2}{q^k} rightrfloor ] Using the inequality: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} leftlfloor frac{x}{y^k} rightrfloor leq frac{x}{y - 1} ] Since p factors into smaller integers far more frequently within the factorial array of p^2, we conclude: [ (p+1) sum_{i=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{p}{q^i} rightrfloor leq sum_{j=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{p^2}{q^j} rightrfloor ] Essentially highlighting that the total prime decomposition within (p^2)! will provide a sufficiently large divisor set to encompass (p!)^{p+1}. 6. **Conclusion**: We reach the conclusion that n leqslant p+1 because p^2! ensures that it can cover the decompositions provided by (p!)^{p+1}.

Let ( I ) be the center of the inscribed circle. 2. Since ( I ) is the point of intersection of the angle bisectors of the internal angles of the trapezoid, ( angle IAD + angle IDA = ( angle DAB + angle ADC ) / 2 = 180^circ / 2 = 90^circ ) due to the parallel lines (AB) and (CD). Therefore, triangle (AID) is right-angled with ( angle AID = 90^circ ). 3. Similarly, triangle (BIC) is also right-angled. 4. Since (IK) and (IL) are the radii of the circle drawn to the points of tangency, ( angle IKD = 90^circ ) and ( angle ILB = 90^circ ). Thus, (IK) and (IL) are altitudes in right-angled triangles (AID) and (BIC) respectively. 5. Using the property of right triangles where the square of the altitude to the hypotenuse is equal to the product of the segments into which it divides the hypotenuse, we have: [ 4^2 = IL^2 = CL cdot LB = CL cdot 16 ] Thus, [ CL = 1 ] 6.

Let ( angle AKO = angle AOK = alpha ). Since (K) divides (AK) and (AO) equally, we have: [ AK = AO implies angle AKO = angle AOK = alpha ] 2. Similarly, because (KM parallel AC), angles alternate: [ angle MKC = angle MCA ] And let: [ angle KMC = beta implies angle MCK = beta ] Since (KM parallel AC), we have: [ angle KCM = angle MAC = beta ] 3.

Consider the case when ( z > 0 ): - Since ( q^2 2^z + 2q^2 = p^2 ), it implies ( p^2 ) is even, so ( p ) must be even. Let ( p = 2p_1 ). - Substituting ( p = 2p_1 ) into the equation, we get: [ q^2 2^z + 2q^2 = (2p_1)^2 implies q^2 2^z + 2q^2 = 4p_1^2 implies q^2 2^{z-1} + q^2 = 2p_1^2 ] - If ( z - 1 > 0 ), then ( q^2 2^{z-1} ) is even, and since ( q^2 ) is also even, ( q ) must be even, which contradicts ( p ) and ( q ) being coprime. Therefore, ( z - 1 leq 0 ), so ( z leq 1 ). - If ( z = 1 ), the equation becomes: [ q^2 2^1 + 2q^2 = p^2 implies 2q^2 + 2q^2 = p^2 implies 4q^2 = p^2 implies p = pm 2q ] - Since ( p ) and ( q ) are coprime, ( q = 1 ) and ( p = pm 2 ). Thus, ( r = pm 2 ). 3. Consider the case when ( z = 0 ): - The equation becomes: [ 2^0 + 2 = r^2 implies 1 + 2 = r^2 implies 3 = r^2 implies r = pm sqrt{3} ] - Since ( r ) must be rational, there are no solutions for ( z = 0 ). 4.

Let ( q = 2^k q_1 ) where ( q_1 ) is not divisible by 2. - If ( x = 2k ) (even), then: [ q_1^2 + 2^{2k+1} q_1^2 = 2^{2k} p^2 implies q_1^2 (1 + 2^{2k+1}) = 2^{2k} p^2 ] - Since ( q_1 ) is not divisible by 2, ( q_1 = 1 ). Thus, ( q = 2^k ). - The equation becomes: [ 1 + 2^{2k+1} = 2^{2k} p^2 implies p^2 = 2^{2k+1} + 1 ] - This implies ( (p-1)(p+1) = 2^{2k+1} ). The only powers of 2 differing by 2 are 2 and 4, so ( p = pm 3 ) and ( q = pm 2 ). Thus, ( r = pm frac{3}{2} ). - If ( x = 2k+1 ) (odd), then: [ q_1^2 + 2^{2k+2} q_1^2 = 2^{2k+1} p^2 implies q_1^2 (1 + 2^{2k+2}) = 2^{2k+1} p^2 ] - Since ( q_1 ) is not divisible by 2, ( q_1 = 1 ).

End and output P when the flowchart dictates. Since we do not have the exact operations and flowchart details, we cannot provide a step-by-step explanation. However, given that the provided solution is C, this means the output P must be 3 after executing the flowchart with an input n of 4. Assuming a typical operation in the flowchart might be decrementing n and performing some operation on P until n reaches 0, let's create an example sequence: 1. Initialize P = 1 (a common initialization value) 2. Perform a loop where within each iteration n is decremented by 1 and P is updated based on a conditional rule. 3. Suppose the rule is to increment P when n is even. 4. So, for n = 4, P will go through the following transformations: - n = 4 is even, increment P to 2 - n = 3 is odd, no change to P - n = 2 is even, increment P to 3 - n = 1 is odd, no change to P In this made-up scenario, the final value for P after executing the flowchart would indeed be 3.

Denote by (P) the point of intersection of the perpendiculars to the lines (a) and (b), drawn from (A) and (B) respectively. Find the locus of points (P). 1. **Identify Key Angles and Orientations**: Since the lines (a) and (b) intersect at point (O), and (A) lies on (a) while (B) lies on (b), we can consider the triangle (AOB). 2. **Geometry of (P)**: The angles (angle PAO) and (angle PBO) are right angles because (P) is the intersection of the perpendiculars from (A) and (B) to lines (a) and (b) respectively. Hence, the points (A), (B), (O), and (P) lie on a circle where (OR) is the diameter of this circle. 3. **Applying Circle Properties**: By the properties of a circle, specifically the intercept theorem or the inscribed angle theorem, the triangle (AOB) being inscribed such that (AB) subtends the diameter (overline{PO}), and because (angle PAO = 90^circ) and (angle PBO = 90^circ), we immediately know that (OR) spans across a circle. 4. **Radius Calculation Using the Law of Sines**: According to the Law of Sines in triangle (AOB), we know: [ frac{AB}{sin theta} = 2R quad Rightarrow quad frac{l}{sin x} = 2R, ] where (x) is the angle between lines (a) and (b), and therefore: [ R = frac{l}{2 sin x}. ] 5. **Summarizing the Locus**: Thus, the point (R) must lie on a circle with radius (R = frac{l}{2 sin x}) because (OR) is essentially the radius that defines the geometrical constraints we have: [ OR = frac{l}{sin x}. ] 6. **Special Case Discussion**: The only special case that needs to be mentioned is when the lines (a) and (b) are perpendicular. In this situation, one of (A) or (B) could coincide with (O), but (P) will still lie on the circle as before. **Conclusion**: So the locus of point (P) is a circle centered at (O) with radius (frac{l}{sin x}), where (x) is the angle between lines (a) and (b).

Therefore, we set up the inequality: [ x^{4} - 625 < 700 ] Adding 625 to both sides to isolate the x^{4} term, we get: [ x^{4} < 1325 ] To find the values of x that satisfy this inequality, we take the fourth root of both sides: [ x < sqrt[4]{1325} ] We know that sqrt[4]{1325} is a number between 6 and 7 because 6^4 = 1296 and 7^4 = 2401. This means that x can be any positive integer less than 7. Therefore, the possible values of x are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. However, we must also consider that the width of the box is given by x-5 units, which must be a positive number for the box to have a physical form. This condition implies that x > 5.

From this pattern, we can conjecture that a_n = frac{n+1}{n}. To prove, consider the following: 1. Base case: When n=1, a_1=1=frac{2}{1}. Therefore, the conjecture is correct. 2.

We calculate the distance ( |P_j A| ): [ |P_j A|^2 = (overline{P_j} - overline{A}) cdot (overline{P_j} - overline{A}) = |overline{P_j}|^2 + |overline{A}|^2 - 2 |overline{P_j}| |overline{A}| cos(alpha_j) ] Since ( |overline{P_j}| = |overline{A}| = 1 ), we have: [ |P_j A|^2 = 1 + 1 - 2 cos(alpha_j) = 2(1 - cos(alpha_j)) = 4 sin^2left(frac{alpha_j}{2}right) ] Hence, [ |P_j A| = 2 sinleft(frac{alpha_j}{2}right) ] 4. The geometric mean ( a ) of the distances from ( A ) is: [ a = sqrt[n]{prod_{i=1}^{n} |P_i A|} = sqrt[n]{prod_{i=1}^{n} 2 sinleft(frac{alpha_i}{2}right)} = 2 sqrt[n]{prod_{i=1}^{n} sinleft(frac{alpha_i}{2}right)} ] 5. Similarly, we calculate the distance ( |P_j B| ): [ |P_j B| = 2 sinleft(frac{pi - alpha_j}{2}right) = 2 cosleft(frac{alpha_j}{2}right) ] 6. The geometric mean ( b ) of the distances from ( B ) is: [ b = 2 sqrt[n]{prod_{i=1}^{n} cosleft(frac{alpha_i}{2}right)} ] 7. Assume, for contradiction, that both ( a > sqrt{2} ) and ( b > sqrt{2} ). Multiplying these inequalities, we get: [ a cdot b = 4 sqrt[n]{prod_{i=1}^{n} sinleft(frac{alpha_i}{2}right) cosleft(frac{alpha_i}{2}right)} > 2 ] Simplifying, we have: [ 4 sqrt[n]{prod_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{2} sin(alpha_i)} > 2 ] [ sqrt[n]{prod_{i=1}^{n} sin(alpha_i)} > 1 ] 8. This is a contradiction because ( sin(x) leq 1 ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ), and thus ( prod_{i=1}^{n} sin(alpha_i) leq 1 ). 9. Therefore, our assumption was wrong, and at least one of ( a ) and ( b ) does not exceed ( sqrt{2} ).

According to his statement, his fellow tribesman (also a knight) stands 2 meters away from him. This means their fellow knight should be islander D (standing 2 meters away from B). 6. **Contradiction Check**: - If A and B are both knights, and their statements are true, we have a contradiction: based on A’s and B's statements, C must be a knight because: - A said his fellow knight stands 1 meter away. (Rightarrow B) - B said his fellow knight stands 2 meters away.

Therefore, D must be a knight (standing 2 meters away from B). 9. **Remaining Islanders**: - If B and D are knights, A is a liar, C must also be a liar. 10. **Evaluate Possible Statements by C and D**: - Since liars always lie, C and D's statements will be false. Possible distances for C (a liar): - Could not be 1 meter (since that would be truthful if referencing B or D). - Any other distance 2 meters, 3 meters, 4 meters, or more would maintain the lie.

When the train crosses a signal pole, it only has to cover its own length, which is 300 meters. It does this in 8 seconds. Therefore, the speed of the train (v) can be calculated using the formula: v = distance / time Substituting the given values: v = 300 m / 8 s = 37.5 m/s Now, when the train crosses the platform, it has to cover the length of itself plus the length of the platform.

The total distance the train covers while crossing the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform: Total distance = Length of train + Length of platform Total distance = 300 m + L The time it takes to cross the platform is given as 39 seconds. Since the speed of the train remains the same, we can use it to find the total distance covered while crossing the platform: Total distance = v * time 300 m + L = 37.5 m/s * 39 s Now we can solve for L: 300 m + L = 1462.5 m L = 1462.5 m - 300 m L = 1162.5 m Therefore, the length of the platform is boxed{1162.5} meters."},{"prompt":"Find the sum of all positive integers n such that, given an unlimited supply of stamps of denominations 3, n, and n+1 cents, 63 cents is the greatest postage that cannot be formed.","completion":"Using the Chicken McNugget theorem, the least possible value of n such that 63 cents cannot be formed satisfies 3n - (3 + n) = 63 implies 2n - 3 = 63 implies 2n = 66 implies n = 33.

Let ( p = 2^{2^n} + a ) be a prime number for some ( n ). 2. **Valuation of ( p-1 )**: Notice that ( p - 1 = 2^{2^n} + a - 1 ). We need to consider the 2-adic valuation ( v_2(p-1) ). Since ( a ) is a positive integer greater than 1, ( v_2(a-1) ) is well-defined. Let ( k = v_2(a-1) ). Then ( v_2(p-1) = v_2(2^{2^n} + a - 1) = v_2(a-1) = k ). 3. **Condition on ( n )**: Choose ( n ) such that ( n > k + 1 ). This ensures that ( 2^n ) is much larger than ( k ). 4. **Expression of ( 2^{2^n} ) modulo ( p )**: Since ( p = 2^{2^n} + a ) is prime, we have ( 2^{2^n} equiv -a pmod{p} ). 5. **Properties of ( -1 ) modulo ( p )**: It is a well-known fact that ( -1 ) can be expressed as ( x^{2^m} pmod{p} ) for ( m leq v_2(p-1) - 1 ).

This implies ( a^{text{odd}} equiv -1 pmod{p} ) for some odd exponent. 7. **Choosing the odd exponent**: We can choose the odd exponent to be of the form ( 2^x - 1 ) for ( x > 1 ).

For Science: 35 marks / 8 = 4.375 marks per 1% 4.375 marks/1% * 100 = 437.5 marks Since we cannot have a fraction of a mark, we'll round it to the nearest whole number. However, since we're looking for the maximum marks and Martin fell short even with the fraction, we should round up to ensure the maximum marks would cover the shortfall. For Science: 438 marks For Literature, Martin needed 90% but fell short by 30 marks. The 30 marks represent the 10% he needed to pass. For Literature: 30 marks / 10 = 3 marks per 1% 3 marks/1% * 100 = 300 marks For Social Studies, Martin needed 88% but fell short by 25 marks. The 25 marks represent the 12% he needed to pass. For Social Studies: 25 marks / 12 ≈ 2.083 marks per 1% 2.083 marks/1% * 100 ≈ 208.3 marks Again, we cannot have a fraction of a mark, and since we're looking for the maximum marks, we should round up.

The HCF (Highest Common Factor) of the two numbers is given as 23. The other two factors of their LCM are 16 and 17. Since HCF is a factor of both numbers, and LCM is a multiple of both numbers, we can find the LCM by multiplying the HCF with the other two factors. LCM = HCF × Factor1 × Factor2 LCM = 23 × 16 × 17 Now, let's calculate the LCM: LCM = 23 × 16 × 17 LCM = 368 × 17 LCM = 6256 Now that we have the LCM, we can find the two numbers. Since the HCF is a factor of both numbers, each number will be a multiple of the HCF. Let's denote the two numbers as A and B, where A is the larger number. A = 23 × a B = 23 × b Where 'a' and 'b' are co-prime (having no common factors other than 1) because the HCF of A and B is 23. The LCM of two numbers is also the product of the HCF and the product of the co-prime factors 'a' and 'b'. We already know the LCM is 6256, so: 6256 = 23 × a × b Since the other two factors of the LCM are 16 and 17, we can deduce that: a × b = 16 × 17 Now, we need to find the values of 'a' and 'b' that are co-prime and multiply to give 16 × 17. Since 16 and 17 are already co-prime (they have no common factors other than 1), we can assign: a = 16 b = 17 Now we can find the two numbers A and B: A = 23 × a = 23 × 16 = 368 B = 23 × b = 23 × 17 = 391 Since we are looking for the larger of the two numbers, the answer is: The larger number is B = boxed{391} ."},{"prompt":"Below is the incorrect solution of two students, A and B, calculating {1}^{4}(10.4)×frac{1}{3}×(2{3}^{2}).<br/>(1) Please circle the first step where each of them made a mistake and explain the error;<br/>(2) Write down the correct solution.<br/> | | Student A | Student B | |||| | Wrong Solution | {1}^{4}(10.4)×frac{1}{3}×(2{3}^{2})<br/>=10.6×frac{1}{3}×(26)<br/>=10.2times left(4right)<br/>=1+0.8<br/>=0.2 | {1}^{4}(10.4)×frac{1}{3}×(2{3}^{2})<br/>=10.6×frac{1}{3}×(29)<br/>=10.2times left(7right)<br/>=1left(1.4right)<br/>=2.4 | | Error Reason | ______ | ______ | | Correct Solution | ______ | ______ |","completion":"# Error Identification and Explanation: **(1)** For Student A, the error occurred in the calculation of 3^{2}.

It's given that both points are above the line y=-3a, and y_{1} > y_{2}. We need to find the range of values for m. First, let's analyze the condition that both points are above the line y=-3a: 1. Since a < 0, we know that -3a > 0 because multiplying a negative number by a negative constant results in a positive number. 2. For point A(m,y_{1}), substituting x=m into the quadratic equation gives us y_{1} = am^{2}-4am. Similarly, for point B(2m,y_{2}), substituting x=2m gives us y_{2} = 4am^{2}-8am. 3. Given that y_{1} > y_{2} and both are above the line y=-3a, we have: - am^{2}-4am > -3a and 4am^{2}-8am > -3a. - Simplifying the inequality for y_{2} gives us 4am^{2}-8am > -3a Rightarrow 4m^{2}-8m+3 < 0 (dividing by a < 0 reverses the inequality sign). - Solving the quadratic inequality 4m^{2}-8m+3 < 0 gives us frac{1}{2} < m < frac{3}{2}.

It focuses on the basic form of the line, the equation of the circle, and the positional relationship between the line and the circle. The line l: x+my=2+m can be rearranged, revealing that although it moves, it passes through the fixed point M(2,1). Substituting point M(2,1) into the equation of the circle x^{2}+y^{2}-2x-2y+1=0, we find that point M is exactly on the circle. Therefore, as long as line l does not tangent to the circle, it can intersect with the circle, thus satisfying the problem statement. Therefore, by finding the value of m when the line is tangent to the circle and then considering the opposite, we can obtain the range of the real number m. **Solution** Given the line l: x+my=2+m can be rearranged to x-2+m(y-1)=0, Therefore, the moving line l passes through the fixed point M(2,1), Since the circle x^{2}+y^{2}-2x-2y+1=0 can be transformed into the standard equation (x-1)^{2}+(y-1)^{2}=1, Therefore, the center of the circle is C(1,1), with radius r=1, Also, since point M(2,1) satisfies (2-1)^{2}+(1-1)^{2}=1, it is exactly on circle C, Therefore, when line l does not tangent to circle C, it must intersect with circle C If line l is tangent to circle C, we have dfrac {|1+m-2-m|}{ sqrt {1+m^{2}}}=1, which gives m=0, Therefore, when mneq 0, line l always intersects with circle C Hence, the correct choice is boxed{text{D}}."},{"prompt":"Grant decided to sell his baseball gear since he was now playing football.

The least number of shoes needed in the island is 10,000. What is the percentage of onelegged inhabitants?","completion":"Let's denote the percentage of one-legged inhabitants as ( P ) and the number of one-legged inhabitants as ( L ). Since there are 10,000 inhabitants on the island, the number of one-legged inhabitants is ( L = frac{P}{100} times 10,000 ). The rest of the inhabitants, who are not one-legged, would be ( 10,000 - L ). Half of these non-one-legged inhabitants go barefooted, so the number of non-one-legged inhabitants who need shoes is ( frac{10,000 - L}{2} ). Each one-legged inhabitant needs only one shoe, and each non-one-legged inhabitant who doesn't go barefooted needs two shoes. Therefore, the total number of shoes needed is the sum of shoes for one-legged inhabitants and shoes for non-one-legged inhabitants who don't go barefooted: [ L + 2 times frac{10,000 - L}{2} = L + 10,000 - L = 10,000 ] This equation simplifies to just 10,000, which is the least number of shoes needed on the island. Since this is the case regardless of the value of ( L ), it means that the number of one-legged inhabitants does not affect the minimum number of shoes needed. However, to minimize the number of shoes, we would want as many one-legged inhabitants as possible, because they only need one shoe each. If all 10,000 inhabitants were one-legged, we would exactly need 10,000 shoes, which is the minimum.

If it encounters a wall, it stays in its current cell. 2. We'll begin by enumerating all possible starting states, defined by the robot’s initial position and the layout of the labyrinth. Since the robot can start in any cell and the labyrinth is fixed, the total number of possible starting states is finite. Let's denote these states as (S_1, S_2, ldots, S_N). 3.

Calculate the first few Fibonacci numbers and observe their last digits: - F_1 = 1 - F_2 = 1 - F_3 = F_1 + F_2 = 1 + 1 = 2 - F_4 = F_2 + F_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 - F_5 = F_3 + F_4 = 2 + 3 = 5 - F_6 = F_4 + F_5 = 3 + 5 = 8 - F_7 = F_5 + F_6 = 5 + 8 = 13 (last digit 3) - F_8 = F_6 + F_7 = 8 + 3 = 11 (last digit 1) - Repeat this process. 2. Create a table for the last digits for a sequence of Fibonacci numbers: - 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4, 1, 5, 6, 1, ldots 3. Observe any periodic pattern: - The first observation might show periodic behavior every 60 digits. 4. Verify the periodicity by calculating more values or proving it mathematically. We repeat calculations and check the repeated patterns - After computing 60 Fibonacci numbers, we realize the sequence starts repeating the last digits every 60 terms. Conclusion: If we check further, the sequence does indeed repeat every 60 numbers. Hence, the sequence of the last digits of the Fibonacci numbers is cyclic with a periodic cycle of 60. We can rigorously conclude this by showing no new last digit pairs within 60 steps, implying cyclic behavior.

That is, there exists some integer k such that: [ S_n = 2^k ] 4. Since S_n = 2^k, we need to show that n must also be a power of 2. To address this, we rearrange the formula for S_n: [ 2 S_n = n left[2a + (n-1)dright] ] 5. Since 2 S_n = 2^{k+1}, we know that 2 S_n is a power of 2. Therefore, n left[2a + (n-1)dright] = 2^{k+1}. 6. We need to show that n must be a power of 2. Note that n is a divisor of 2 S_n. 7. Invoke the unique prime factorization theorem which states any divisor of a number which is a power of 2 must also be a power of 2. This is because the only prime factor involved in any power of 2 is 2 itself, and hence any divisor can only be composed of the same prime factor, maintaining the property of being a power of 2. 8.

The remaining coins after the 9th pirate are: [ 1000 cdot frac{9}{10} cdot frac{8}{10} cdot ldots cdot frac{2}{10} = 1000 cdot frac{9!}{10^8} ] Calculating further: [ 1000 cdot frac{9!}{10^8} = 1000 cdot 0.0028 = 2.8 ] Therefore, the 10th pirate would take 2.8, but since each pirate receives whole number of coins, we conclude x needs to be adjusted to give a whole number in final calculation.

Start by cross-multiplying the given fractions: [ (a + b)(d + a) = (b + c)(c + d) ] 2. Expand both sides of the equation: [ ad + a^2 + bd + ab = bc + bd + cd + bc ] 3. Simplify the expanded form: [ a^2 + ab + ad + bd = bc + bc + cd + bd ] 4. Cancel out (bd) from both sides: [ a^2 + ab + ad = 2bc + cd ] If we rearrange, we have: [ a^2 + ab + ad - cd = 2bc ] To explore this equation further, let’s express it in another form with convenient variable isolation. 5. Next, consider the derived fractions: [ frac{a+b}{c+d} = frac{b+c}{d+a} ] 6. Cross-multiply them as well to get: [ (a+b)(d+a) = (b+c)(c+d) ] 7.

Thus, if (a + b + c + d = 0), we cannot determine (a) and (c) directly, and both conditions given hold. 10.

Let's start by considering triangle ABC with AD as its altitude, and P as a point on AD. We are given that the lines BP and CP intersect CA at E and AB at F respectively. 2. To prove the required result, we first apply **Ceva's theorem** for triangle ABC with concurrent lines BP, CP, and AD. By Ceva's theorem, we have: [ frac{AE}{BE} cdot frac{BD}{DC} cdot frac{CF}{FA} = 1 ] 3. Note that since D is the foot of the altitude, we can express BD/DC in terms of tangents of angles B and C. Given the perpendicularity, we have: [ frac{BD}{DC} = frac{tan angle BAD}{tan angle CAD} = frac{tan C}{tan B} ] 4. Substituting this into Ceva's theorem, we obtain: [ frac{AE}{BE} cdot frac{tan C}{tan B} cdot frac{CF}{FA} = 1 ] 5. Simplifying, we get: [ frac{AE}{BE} cdot frac{CF}{FA} = frac{tan B}{tan C} ] 6. Next, observe the triangles triangle BPD and triangle CPD. In each triangle, the angles at P are vertical angles and hence they are equal. We focus on the segments BE and AE and the angles they form with P. Specifically, we have: angle BPE = angle EDB and angle CPE = angle FDC. Here, we'll use the tangent of the angles formed: [ tan angle EDB = frac{BE sin B}{AE cos B} ] Similarly, for frac{CF sin C}{FA cos C}, we have: [ tan angle FDC = frac{CF sin C}{FA cos C} ] 7. Since the triangles are inscribed in the same circle, and because angles angle EDF subtend the same arc, we establish that: [ tan angle EDB = tan angle FDC ] 8. Thus, angle EDB = angle FDC follows directly from tan angle EDB = tan angle FDC. 9. Therefore, angle angle ADE equals angle angle ADF.

Let's suppose every resident of the city is the president of the same number k of clubs. Here, ( k ) is a non-negative integer. 2. **Counting the Total Number of Clubs:** Since each resident presides over k clubs and there are 1001 residents, the total number of clubs can be counted in two different ways: - First, the number of clubs is ( 1001 times k ) because every resident is a president of exactly k clubs and there are 1001 residents. - Second, the number of clubs is the number of ways to choose 13 members out of 1001.

None of these terms are multiples of 13 because: - ( 989 < 1000 ) - The next closest multiple of 13 greater than 988 but less than 1001 is ( 1001 = 13 times 77 ). 8. **Contradiction:** Since none of the terms ( 1000, 999, ldots, 989 ) is divisible by 13 and ( mathrm{gcd}(1001, 13^2) = 13 ), it leads to ( k ) must force the divisions paradox of ( binom{1001}{13} = 13 times 77 times k ). 9. **Conclusion:** This assumption leads to an inherent contradiction because it implies a non-divisibility in terms supposed to be assumed divisible precisely per our assumed structure. 10. **Final Proof:** Hence, our assumption that every resident is president of the same number of clubs is incorrect. Thus, there must be residents who are presidents of different numbers of clubs, hence proving the statement.

Combine both cases to cover all groups and sum choices.

Let me explain what these terms mean in that context: 1. **Top-p (nucleus sampling)**: This is a method used to generate text by the model. Instead of picking the most likely next word, the model looks at the smallest set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold p (a value between 0 and 1). This method allows for more creative and diverse text generation because it considers a broader set of possibilities than just the most likely next word. The higher the value of p, the more diverse the generated text can be. 2. **Temperature**: This parameter controls the randomness of predictions by scaling the logits before applying softmax. When the temperature is low (close to 0), the model's output will be more deterministic, favoring words with higher probabilities and making the text more predictable and less varied. Conversely, a higher temperature leads to more randomness in the word selection, potentially making the text more creative or diverse but also increasing the chance of producing nonsensical results. These parameters are part of what's called \\"sampling strategies,\\" which guide how models like GPT-3 generate text. They're adjustable to fine-tune the balance between creativity and coherence in the model's output. If you're looking to understand how to adjust these for a specific use case or have more in-depth questions about how these models work, feel free to ask!"},{"prompt":"“by mistake.”. how determined?","completion":"My determination that something might be \\"by mistake\\" comes from identifying patterns or contexts that seem out of place based on an extensive database of interactions and the expected conversational flow.

To enhance the algorithm’s generalization ability when dealing with challenge scenes, e.g. eye blinking, we utilize several event data enhancement techniques in training phase, including spatial flip, spatial shift, event-cutout and etc. These data enhancement techniques are visualized Fig. 4. And the event-cutout is a tailor-made data enhancement technique for eye tracking, of which the core idea is randomly masking spatial regions, forcing the network to learn global features and avoid getting trapped in local minutiae[12]. The event-cutout is designed by randomly sampling the height and width value as the size of spatial mask and also randomly sampling the x, y coordinate as the location of the mask location in original Bina-rep. The region in this mask will be filled into 0, indicating the event in this region will be free. This technique helps to generate the spatial interference in training phase and is particularly effective in scenarios such as blinking or wearing glasses, which hinders the model to focus on valid eye region. 其中 Figure 4. Various data enhancement methods are adapted to improve the robustness, including spatial flip, spatial shift, eventcutout and etc. Event-Cutout is a spatial enhancement technique suitable for event-based eye tracking, which sets the pixels within random rectangular box to zero to simulate potential external interference, e.g., eye blinking. 该事件数据增强实现过程转换成代码是？","completion":"Implementing event-cutout and other data augmentation techniques described requires understanding the steps to create such augmentations programmatically.

\`image\`：输入的图像，一个2D数组。 - \`mask_size_ratio\`：遮盖区域大小比例，决定了矩形遮罩相对于原图的最小和最大比例尺寸。 - \`mask_value\`：用于填充遮罩区域的值。 4. **示例使用**：代码最后给出了一个简单的使用示例，它先生成一张随机值的模拟图像（假设图像尺寸为240x320），然后应用事件剪除增强方法。 # 其他增强技术 类似的增强技术，如空间翻转和位移，也可以通过NumPy来实现，或者使用专门的图像增强库如\`imgaug\`或\`albumentations\`来完成更复杂的增强操作。 # 注意事项 -

He often went on little adventures, exploring his surroundings and looking for something exciting to happen. Little did he know that today would be a day he would never forget. As Krash playfully hopped along, he stumbled upon a strange sight - a crashed spaceship! Excitement coursed through his furry little body as he approached the vessel cautiously. He noticed bright orange liquid leaking out from one of the ship’s broken windows. Curiosity getting the better of him, Krash carefully stepped closer to investigate. As he unknowingly trod on the sticky substance, it started to change form, slowly morphing into the shape of a girl. Startled, Krash backed away, watching in awe as the slimy substance completed its transformation. The slime-shaped girl stood before him, orange hues shimmering on her translucent body. “Greetings, Earthling! I am Emily, a stranded alien whose spaceship crash-landed here,” she introduced herself, her voice sounding jovial. “I can morph into anything” she said as she morphed into numerous shapes before turning back to her form “Thank you for release from your bubble, now would you be so kind as to help me?” Krash, ever the helpful and adventurous friend, eagerly nodded. “Of course, Emily! How can I assist you?” he asked, slightly mesmerized by the uniqueness of the situation. Emily reached into a small compartment on her spaceship and retrieved a vibrant potion. “By drinking this potion, I can temporarily change my colour, This allows me to blend in more with your world ,” she explained. “The perfect opportunity to explore your wonderful planet.” Curiosity piqued once again, Krash watched as Emily consumed the potion. Suddenly, her shape shifted and molded into a perfect replica of Krash himself. Krash’s eyes widened in astonishment as he saw Emily morphing into an identical version of him. With a mischievous sparkle in her gooey eyes,Emily ddecided to play a trick on the other KikoRiki friends. She imitated Krash’s voice flawlessly and, transformed into his likeness, went off to find her unsuspecting targets - Wally, Carlin, and Chiko. Finding the other KikoRiki friends enjoying a picnic by the riverbank, Emily approached them, looking and sounding just like Krash. She engaged them in a playful conversation, imitating Krash’s usual jokes and gestures. However, the gooey consistency of her fur couldn’t be hidden, and as her “Krash” voice continued, the others began to feel something amiss. Carlin was the first to notice something was off. Tentatively, he reached out his paw to touch the faux Krash’s fur. His paw sank ever so slightly into the gooey texture, and he quickly withdrew it. “Wait a minute… Krash, your fur feels… sticky! What’s going on?” he queried, astounded. “Your fur is all gooey, It’s like you’re now made out of slime.” Wally and Chiko also touched the fur, feeling the stickiness. Their eyes widened in realization. “This isn’t Krash, it’s some kind of gooey impostor!” Wally exclaimed, pointing at the faux Krash. “Who are you and what have you done to Krash?” he asked. The gooey creature struggled to conceal her secret as she faced a string of accusations from Krash’s friends, Her malleable body had shaped into an exact replica of Krash, but she couldn’t replicate the softness of his fur. Caught red-handed, Emily couldn’t help but burst into a fit of laughter, reverting back to her true form. The others joined in, laughing at the funny turn of events. Emily apologized for her prank and explained her crash-landing, much to the amusement and fascination of her newfound friends. From that day forward, Emily became an honorary member of the KikoRiki gang. Together, they embarked on new adventures, using Emily’s unique abilities to overcome obstacles and bring joy to Sunny Patch. And so, the mischievous morphing alien and the KikoRiki friends formed an unbreakable bond, forever reminding them of the day their laughter echoed through the forest, leaving behind tales of friendship and unforgettable pranks. Write about her appearance, abilities and consistency Emily, the morphing alien, possessed a unique and captivating appearance. Initially, when she transformed from the bright orange liquid, her body was translucent with shimmering orange hues, giving her an ethereal, almost magical look. Her consistency was akin to goo or slime, allowing her to mold and reshape her form at will. This gooey texture, while visually intriguing, was noticeably different to the touch compared to the soft fur of the KikoRiki friends, which ultimately gave her disguise away. Emily’s abilities were nothing short of extraordinary. She could morph into any shape or form she desired, a talent she revealed shortly after meeting Krash by transforming into various objects and creatures before settling back into her humanoid form. Furthermore, with the help of a vibrant potion, she could temporarily alter her color, enabling her to blend in more with her surroundings or impersonate others more convincingly, as she demonstrated by becoming an exact replica of Krash. This morphing ability extended beyond mere physical appearances; Emily could flawlessly imitate voices and mannerisms, making her impersonations incredibly convincing at first glance. Despite her gooey and translucent appearance, Emily had a bright, jovial personality, full of curiosity and eager to explore the world of Sunny Patch with her new friends. Her laughter and playful nature were infectious, quickly endearing her to the KikoRiki gang despite the initial shock of her prank. Emily’s unique physical form and abilities added an extraordinary dynamic to the group’s adventures. Her capacity to reshape herself provided endless entertainment and practical solutions to challenges the friends faced. Whether it was crossing a river by transforming into a bridge or scaring away a predator by becoming a larger, more intimidating creature, Emily’s talents were a source of wonder and fascination. Even with her remarkable abilities, it was the gooey consistency of Emily’s body that remained a constant reminder of her otherworldly origin. It was this slime-like quality that, while useful for morphing, made close physical interactions with her a bit unusual for her friends. However, it also became a symbol of the unique bond they shared with Emily, a friend unlike any other, whose presence brought a new dimension of magic and camaraderie to Sunny Patch. Write Krash describing her appearance Krash, full of excitement and always keen to share his adventures with others, would describe Emily with a sense of wonder and amazement that reflects his vibrant personality and curious nature. His eyes would light up, and he’d gesture animatedly as he paints a picture of Emily for anyone willing to listen. “You won’t believe your ears when I tell you about Emily! She’s not like anyone we’ve ever met here in Sunny Patch. At first glance, she might seem like a magical puzzle, her body shimmering with these incredible orange hues that look like the sunrise itself. Imagine the coolest, most extraordinary goo or slime you’ve ever played with, but alive and sparkling with every color of orange you can think of - that’s Emily!” He’d lean in closer, lowering his voice to a conspiratorial whisper, his enthusiasm barely contained. “And you know what? She can change into anything! One minute she’s this glittering, translucent figure that looks almost human, but the next, she can be a flower, a rock, or even me! I’ve seen it with my own eyes. It’s like she’s made of magic, able to become whatever she wants. And her voice, it can mimic anyone - I mean, she had us fooled for a good moment there!” “But the craziest part,” he’d continue, eyes wide with amazement, “is her consistency. She feels like goo, you know? Not like any fur or skin I’ve touched before. If you poke her, your finger kinda sinks in a little, it’s all squishy and sticky. But not in a bad way, it’s actually pretty cool once you get used to it. And she glows, kind of, especially when the sunlight hits her just right. It’s like looking at a piece of the forest that decided to wake up and walk around!” Krash would finish his description with a big smile, clearly in awe of his new friend. “Emily’s the most unusual and fascinating friend we’ve made. And it’s not just about how she looks or what she can do. It’s who she is, you know? Always up for a laugh, ready to explore, and just… magical. She’s added so much joy and excitement to Sunny Patch.

Write a story where Krash sees her morphing from a blob into her usual form","completion":"In the heart of Sunny Patch, amidst a chorus of chirping birds and rustling leaves, Krash the Rabbit found himself embarking on yet another day filled with potential adventures. The sun hung high, casting a warm glow over the forest, illuminating the path ahead of him. As he hopped along, lost in thought about where his feet might take him today, he stumbled upon an extraordinary sight that would forever change his understanding of the world. There, right in front of him, lay a bright orange blob, pulsating softly on the forest floor. It seemed out of place amidst the greens and browns of the earth, a splash of vivid color that screamed for attention. Krash, driven by an insatiable curiosity, approached the blob cautiously, his ears twitching and nose sniffing the air. As he watched, the blob began to quiver and shake. It was as if an invisible artist sculpted it from the inside, stretching and pulling it into new forms. Krash could hardly believe his eyes as the shapeless mass started to morph, gradually standing taller and taking on a humanoid form. The blob’s once undefined edges sharpened, details emerging from its orange gooey substance. Limbs sprouted, fingers defined, and soon a face carved itself into the front, eyes twinkling with life where there was none before. The transformation was mesmerizing, and Krash sat utterly enthralled by the spectacle. Within moments, standing before him was not a blob but a girl, her form translucent and shimmering with an array of orange hues that reflected the sun’s rays beautifully. She looked around, her gaze landing on Krash with a friendly sparkle. “Greetings, Earthling! I am Emily, a stranded alien whose spaceship crash-landed here,” she introduced herself, her voice melodious and warm. Despite her otherworldly origin, there was an inviting charm about her that put Krash immediately at ease. Krash, always open-hearted and eager to make new friends, hopped a step closer. “I’ve never met an alien before! What happened? How can you… do that?” he asked, gesturing to where she had been a blob just moments ago. Emily laughed, a sound like tinkling bells. “I can morph into anything,” she explained, demonstrating her unique talent by briefly shifting her arm into a flower and then back again. “I’m made of a substance not found on Earth. It allows me to change my shape and color at will.” The rabbit’s eyes widened in wonder. “That’s amazing!” Krash exclaimed, his imagination already running wild with the possibilities. “Is there anything we can do to help you get back home or at least make your stay here more comfortable?” Her eyes gleamed with a mischievous light. “Actually, I was hoping to explore your planet a bit, maybe learn about its inhabitants and customs. You could say I’m on an unintended intergalactic field trip,” Emily said, a playful grin spreading across her face. And so began an unexpected journey for Krash and Emily, one filled with new discoveries, laughter, and challenges. Krash showed Emily the wonders of Sunny Patch, introducing her to its residents and sharing with her the joys of forest life. In return, Emily enchanted him with tales of distant galaxies and the marvels of space travel, her eyes always sparkling with the thrill of adventure. Their days were filled with wonders as Emily used her abilities to create shortcuts, entertain, and occasionally play harmless pranks on the other inhabitants of the forest. Each morph, each transformation was a testament to the magic that had entered Krash’s life with Emily’s arrival. Krash found in Emily a kindred spirit, someone as curious and adventurous as himself, but with the added twist of otherworldly abilities. Watching her morph from a simple blob into her usual form was a sight he would never tire of, one that reminded him daily of the limitless possibilities the universe held. And as time passed, the bond between the mischievous morphing alien and the adventurous rabbit only grew stronger, built on a foundation of shared experiences and unwavering friendship. They knew that no matter what adventures lay ahead, they would face them together, exploring the mysteries of Sunny Patch and perhaps, one day, the mysteries beyond the stars."},{"prompt":"Piccolo power up, to everyone surprise, and started to transform.

He often went on little adventures, exploring his surroundings and looking for something exciting to happen. Little did he know that today would be a day he would never forget. As Krash playfully hopped along, he stumbled upon a strange sight - a crashed spaceship! Excitement coursed through his furry little body as he approached the vessel cautiously. He noticed bright orange liquid leaking out from one of the ship’s broken windows. Curiosity getting the better of him, Krash carefully stepped closer to investigate. As he unknowingly trod on the sticky substance, it started to change form, slowly morphing into the shape of a girl. Startled, Krash backed away, watching in awe as the slimy substance completed its transformation. The slime-shaped girl stood before him, orange hues shimmering on her translucent body. “Greetings, Earthling! I am Emily, a stranded alien whose spaceship crash-landed here,” she introduced herself, her voice sounding jovial. “I can morph into anything” she said as she morphed into numerous shapes before turning back to her form “Thank you for release from your bubble, now would you be so kind as to help me?” Krash, ever the helpful and adventurous friend, eagerly nodded. “Of course, Emily! How can I assist you?” he asked, slightly mesmerized by the uniqueness of the situation. Emily reached into a small compartment on her spaceship and retrieved a vibrant potion. “By drinking this potion, I can temporarily change my colour, This allows me to blend in more with your world ,” she explained. “The perfect opportunity to explore your wonderful planet.” Curiosity piqued once again, Krash watched as Emily consumed the potion. Suddenly, her shape shifted and molded into a perfect replica of Krash himself. Krash’s eyes widened in astonishment as he saw Emily morphing into an identical version of him. With a mischievous sparkle in her gooey eyes,Emily ddecided to play a trick on the other KikoRiki friends. She imitated Krash’s voice flawlessly and, transformed into his likeness, went off to find her unsuspecting targets - Wally, Carlin, and Chiko. Finding the other KikoRiki friends enjoying a picnic by the riverbank, Emily approached them, looking and sounding just like Krash. She engaged them in a playful conversation, imitating Krash’s usual jokes and gestures. However, the gooey consistency of her fur couldn’t be hidden, and as her “Krash” voice continued, the others began to feel something amiss. Carlin was the first to notice something was off. Tentatively, he reached out his paw to touch the faux Krash’s fur. His paw sank ever so slightly into the gooey texture, and he quickly withdrew it. “Wait a minute… Krash, your fur feels… sticky! What’s going on?” he queried, astounded. “Your fur is all gooey, It’s like you’re now made out of slime.” Wally and Chiko also touched the fur, feeling the stickiness. Their eyes widened in realization. “This isn’t Krash, it’s some kind of gooey impostor!” Wally exclaimed, pointing at the faux Krash. “Who are you and what have you done to Krash?” he asked. The gooey creature struggled to conceal her secret as she faced a string of accusations from Krash’s friends, Her malleable body had shaped into an exact replica of Krash, but she couldn’t replicate the softness of his fur. Caught red-handed, Emily couldn’t help but burst into a fit of laughter, reverting back to her true form. The others joined in, laughing at the funny turn of events. Emily apologized for her prank and explained her crash-landing, much to the amusement and fascination of her newfound friends. From that day forward, Emily became an honorary member of the KikoRiki gang. Together, they embarked on new adventures, using Emily’s unique abilities to overcome obstacles and bring joy to Sunny Patch. And so, the mischievous morphing alien and the KikoRiki friends formed an unbreakable bond, forever reminding them of the day their laughter echoed through the forest, leaving behind tales of friendship and unforgettable pranks. Write about her appearance, abilities and consistency Emily, the morphing alien, possessed a unique and captivating appearance. Initially, when she transformed from the bright orange liquid, her body was translucent with shimmering orange hues, giving her an ethereal, almost magical look. Her consistency was akin to goo or slime, allowing her to mold and reshape her form at will. This gooey texture, while visually intriguing, was noticeably different to the touch compared to the soft fur of the KikoRiki friends, which ultimately gave her disguise away. Emily’s abilities were nothing short of extraordinary. She could morph into any shape or form she desired, a talent she revealed shortly after meeting Krash by transforming into various objects and creatures before settling back into her humanoid form. Furthermore, with the help of a vibrant potion, she could temporarily alter her color, enabling her to blend in more with her surroundings or impersonate others more convincingly, as she demonstrated by becoming an exact replica of Krash. This morphing ability extended beyond mere physical appearances; Emily could flawlessly imitate voices and mannerisms, making her impersonations incredibly convincing at first glance. Despite her gooey and translucent appearance, Emily had a bright, jovial personality, full of curiosity and eager to explore the world of Sunny Patch with her new friends. Her laughter and playful nature were infectious, quickly endearing her to the KikoRiki gang despite the initial shock of her prank. Emily’s unique physical form and abilities added an extraordinary dynamic to the group’s adventures. Her capacity to reshape herself provided endless entertainment and practical solutions to challenges the friends faced. Whether it was crossing a river by transforming into a bridge or scaring away a predator by becoming a larger, more intimidating creature, Emily’s talents were a source of wonder and fascination. Even with her remarkable abilities, it was the gooey consistency of Emily’s body that remained a constant reminder of her otherworldly origin. It was this slime-like quality that, while useful for morphing, made close physical interactions with her a bit unusual for her friends. However, it also became a symbol of the unique bond they shared with Emily, a friend unlike any other, whose presence brought a new dimension of magic and camaraderie to Sunny Patch. Write Krash describing her appearance Krash, full of excitement and always keen to share his adventures with others, would describe Emily with a sense of wonder and amazement that reflects his vibrant personality and curious nature. His eyes would light up, and he’d gesture animatedly as he paints a picture of Emily for anyone willing to listen. “You won’t believe your ears when I tell you about Emily! She’s not like anyone we’ve ever met here in Sunny Patch. At first glance, she might seem like a magical puzzle, her body shimmering with these incredible orange hues that look like the sunrise itself. Imagine the coolest, most extraordinary goo or slime you’ve ever played with, but alive and sparkling with every color of orange you can think of - that’s Emily!” He’d lean in closer, lowering his voice to a conspiratorial whisper, his enthusiasm barely contained. “And you know what? She can change into anything! One minute she’s this glittering, translucent figure that looks almost human, but the next, she can be a flower, a rock, or even me! I’ve seen it with my own eyes. It’s like she’s made of magic, able to become whatever she wants. And her voice, it can mimic anyone - I mean, she had us fooled for a good moment there!” “But the craziest part,” he’d continue, eyes wide with amazement, “is her consistency. She feels like goo, you know? Not like any fur or skin I’ve touched before. If you poke her, your finger kinda sinks in a little, it’s all squishy and sticky. But not in a bad way, it’s actually pretty cool once you get used to it. And she glows, kind of, especially when the sunlight hits her just right. It’s like looking at a piece of the forest that decided to wake up and walk around!” Krash would finish his description with a big smile, clearly in awe of his new friend. “Emily’s the most unusual and fascinating friend we’ve made. And it’s not just about how she looks or what she can do. It’s who she is, you know? Always up for a laugh, ready to explore, and just… magical. She’s added so much joy and excitement to Sunny Patch. You’ve gotta meet her to believe it!” Through Krash’s eyes, Emily’s unique appearance and abilities are not just seen but felt, conveying the sense of wonder and magic she brings into his world. Write a story where they are sitting by a pond,","completion":"reflecting on their adventures and contemplating the peaceful scenery around them. The gentle lapping of water against the pond's edge and the serene hum of the forest set the stage for a moment of calm and introspection among the friends. Emily, in her shimmering, translucent form, sat comfortably on the grassy bank beside Krash, who was eagerly tossing pebbles into the pond, watching the ripples expand and disappear. The late afternoon sun cast a warm glow over the scene, highlighting Emily’s orange hues and making them dance like fire. \\"You know, Emily,\\" Krash began, his voice thoughtful, \\"when I first met you, I never could've imagined the adventures we'd have. It's been... well, it's been incredible.\\" Emily smiled, morphing her form slightly so that she appeared to sit more comfortably, her gooey nature effortlessly adapting. \\"I feel the same, Krash. Before crash-landing here, I could only dream about exploring a world with such vibrant life and making genuine friends. My planet is nothing like Sunny Patch.\\" Their gaze was fixed on the tranquil water, a mirror reflecting the changing sky as dusk began to settle over the forest. \\"I've learned so much from you and our friends,\\" Emily continued. \\"Not just about this world, but about bravery, friendship, and even laughter. My abilities... they've always made me feel different, but here, they bring us together.\\" Krash nodded, his ears perked up attentively. \\"Yeah, your morphing is super cool! But it's not just what you can do that makes you special, Emily. It's who you are. You're curious, kind, and, well, a whole lot of fun. You fit right in with the KikoRiki gang.\\" There was a brief pause as a duck glided across the pond, disturbing the water's surface, before tranquility returned. Emily's form briefly flickered, adopting a soft, glowing quality. \\"I've always been on the move, never staying in one place long enough to form connections like this. Being here with you all, it's made me see the value in stopping to enjoy the moment. Like now, just sitting here, chatting by the pond.\\" Krash chuckled, a warm, joyful sound that echoed lightly through the trees. \\"Yeah, it's not always about the big adventures, is it? Sometimes, it's these quiet moments that mean the most.\\" As the sky turned from blue to a pallet of pinks and oranges, they sat in silence, deeply content and in tune with the world around them. Emily’s presence by the pond, a unique entity so different yet so integral to the fabric of their friendship, was a vivid testament to the adventures and lessons shared. The day had wound down to a peaceful close, a reminder of the adventures that had brought them together and the many more that lay ahead. With a friend like Emily, Krash knew that life in Sunny Patch would never be dull, filled with wonder, laughter, and, most importantly, a bond that transcended worlds. And so, by the pond, amidst the gentle symphony of nature, Krash and Emily shared not just reflections on their past but dreams of future escapades. For in Sunny Patch, with friends by your side, the possibilities were as limitless as the night sky beginning to blanket over them."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where he asks what form she usually takes back home on her planet","completion":"The following day found Emily and Krash lounging under the shade of a tall oak tree, the comforting rustle of leaves above them creating a calm ambiance. After their reflective time by the pond, there was a sense of deeper connection between them, a bond strengthened by shared vulnerability and truths. Krash had been pondering over a question since their conversation the previous day, his curiosity about Emily’s life and species growing stronger. “So, Emily,” Krash started, his tone a mixture of curiosity and hesitation, “yesterday you shared so much about your adventures and how you’ve adapted here. But it got me thinking, what form do you usually take back home on your planet? Is it like how you are here, or something entirely different?” Emily’s form shimmered in the dappled sunlight, a thoughtful expression crossing what you could call her face. It was a question she hadn’t expected, a dive into a part of her life she rarely shared, even among the closest of her new friends. “Back home,” she began, her voice soft, almost nostalgic, “our forms are quite different from what you see here. Our planet, Vionyx, is a place of vibrant energies and fluid structures. We exist in a state of what you might describe here as energy and consciousness, without a fixed physical form like the creatures of Earth.” Krash listened intently, his ears perked up, absorbing every word. Emily’s description painted a picture in his mind of a world so foreign and fascinating, it was hard to fully grasp. “In Vionyx, we communicate through variations of energy and light, and our ‘forms’ are adapted to this method of existence. Being here, in this physical world, required me to choose a form that could interact with the environment and its inhabitants effectively,” she continued, her form gently pulsating with a soft glow as if to emphasize her point. “So, this,” she gestured to her current form, “is something chosen, a way to bridge my world and yours. At home, I would be a flowing, ever-changing essence of light and energy, constantly interacting with others in a dance of colors and vibrations.” Krash’s eyes widened with wonder, trying to imagine Emily as a being of light, communicating in colors and vibrations. “Wow, that sounds… incredible, Emily. It’s so different from anything here. Do you miss it?” A moment of silence passed as Emily seemed to reflect on his question. Then, with a warmth in her voice, she replied, “I do miss it, occasionally. There’s a certain freedom in existing as pure energy. But, Krash, the experiences I’ve had here, the friendships I’ve formed, they've given me something equally precious. A sense of belonging and purpose I hadn’t realized I was searching for.” Krash smiled, feeling honored that Emily had opened up about such a personal aspect of her life. “I’m really glad you’re here, Emily. Sunny Patch, and especially I, would not be the same without you.” Their conversation drifted into a comfortable silence, each lost in their thoughts. Krash pondered the vastness of the universe, filled with wonders beyond his imagination, while Emily basked in the warmth of a friendship that made her feel at home, far from the energy fields of Vionyx. In that quiet afternoon under the oak tree, Emily and Krash understood each other a little more, their friendship deepened by the sharing of worlds both vastly different and remarkably similar in the things that truly mattered."},{"prompt":"Salam, Saman jan.

Предпринимательские проекты, коммерциализация технологий. 4. Экономическое содержание проектного управления Системный подход к управлению проектами Мы живем в мире систем, в которых все связано со всем. Эти системы связаны друг с другом. Связи могут быть неочевидны, нелинейны, могут казаться парадоксальными. Чтобы правильно ориентироваться в этом мире, нашему мышлению необходимо быть системным. Системный подход в управлении https://www.bitobe.ru/expertise/1935 Системное мышление – это способ видеть целое, умение смотреть не на вещи, а на взаимодействие между ними, усматривать общую тенденцию изменений в последовательности отдельных состояний. П. Сенге, директор Центра организационного обучения MIT Sloan Прежде чем перейти к изучению принципов системного подхода к управлению, в том числе – к управлению проектами, рассмотрим его ключевые особенности. Системное мышление в управлении предполагает: 1) способность видеть в любой задаче систему, то есть уметь отвечать на вопросы: Из каких элементов состоит система? Как эти элементы связаны между собой? Где проходит граница системы, в рамках которой решается данная проблема? Какие факторы оказывают влияние на систему? Что будет происходить с системой, если ей не управлять? Как изменить систему, чтобы достичь результата? и т.п.; 2) оценивать глубину мышления, то есть видеть проблему с разных сторон, отслеживать причинно-следственные связи на шаг-два вперед; 3) контролировать масштаб мышления, то есть уметь смотреть на ресурсы и время, выделенные не решение задачи, с учетом сложности этой задачи; 4) понимать, как изменение системы в рамках данной задачи отразится на деятельности остальных систем и на организации в целом. Такой подход позволяет обеспечить существенные преимущества с позиций результативности процесса управления (рис. 1.1). Рис. 1.1. Преимущества системного мышления в управленческой деятельности Существуют различные определения ключевого для данной темы понятия системы. Система (др.греч. – целое, составленное из частей; соединение) – это: – множество элементов, находящихся в отношениях и связях друг с другом, которое образует определённую целостность, единство; – совокупность элементов, находящихся в определённых отношениях друг с другом и со средой; – комбинация взаимодействующих элементов, организованных для достижения одной или нескольких поставленных целей; – совокупность интегрированных и регулярно взаимодействующих или взаимозависимых элементов, созданная для достижения определённых целей, причём отношения между элементами определены и устойчивы, а общая производительность или функциональность системы лучше, чем у простой суммы элементов (PMBOK). Системный подход – это подход, при котором любой объект (процесс) рассматривается как совокупность взаимосвязанных элементов (компонентов), имеющая выход (цель), вход (ресурсы), связь с внешней средой, обратную связь. В соответствии с ним управленческие действия не просто функционально вытекают друг из друга, а все без исключения оказывают друг на друга как непосредственное, так и опосредованное воздействие. В силу этого изменения в одном звене организации неизбежно вызывают изменения в остальных, а в конечном итоге в ней в целом В качестве принципиальных особенностей системы чаще всего рассматривают: – целостность (эмерджентность) – предполагает, что каждый элемент системы вносит вклад в реализацию целевой функции системы. Проявляется в появлении у системы новых свойств, отсутствующих у элементов; – целесообразность (целеустремленность) – подчиненность состава и структуры системы поставленной цели, движение (развитие) в направлении цели; – иерархичность – означает, что каждая компонента системы, в свою очередь, может рассматриваться как система, а сама исследуемая система представляет собой лишь один из компонентов более широкой системы. Проявляется в построении и использовании при управлении нескольких уровней. На каждом уровне выполняются определенные задачи, полученные при декомпозиции (разделении) общей задачи, стоящей перед всей системой; – коммуникативность – выражается в том, что система не изолирована, а связана множеством коммуникаций с внешней средой; коммуникационные связи пронизывают систему и изнутри – организованность – заключается в наличии у системы структуры и функционирования (поведения). Как следствие – рассматривается как свойство системы реагировать на изменение сложности путем изменения множества реализуемых связей, противостоять процессам разупорядочения и развиваться к состоянию более высокой (эффективной) организации с помощью процессов управления. Управление – это деятельность, направленная на координацию функционирования объекта (системы) и ориентированная на достижение поставленных целей; воздействие субъекта управления на управляемую систему (объект управления) с целью обеспечения ее требуемого поведения или изменения характеристик. В общем виде управление представляет собой целенаправленное взаимодействие двух объектов, один из которых находится в позиции субъекта управления, а другой – в позиции объекта управления. Для этого взаимодействия характерно то, что: – субъект управления направляет объекту управления импульсы воздействия (команды управления), которые содержат информацию о том, как должен функционировать объект управления; – объект управления получает данные импульсы и действует в соответствии с ними и с учетом сложившейся ситуации (рис. 2.1). Рис. 1.2. Структура системы управления Исключительно важную роль для управления имеет информация, поступающая от объекта управления к субъекту по каналам обратной связи. На основании этой информации формируются следующие управляющие воздействия, при необходимости корректируются сформированные планы. Проект – это: – временное предприятие, предназначенное для создания уникальных продуктов или услуг (PMBОK); – комплекс взаимосвязанных мероприятий, направленный на создание уникального продукта или услуги в условиях временных и ресурсных ограничений; – ограниченное по времени целенаправленное изменение отдельной системы с изначально четко определенными целями, достижение которых определяет завершение проекта, с установленными требованиями к срокам, результатам, риску, рамкам расходования средств и ресурсов и к организационной структуре. Временный характер проекта не обязательно предполагает краткую длительность проекта, а означает, что у любого проекта есть определенное начало и завершение. Завершение наступает, когда достигнуты цели проекта; или признано, что цели проекта не будут или не могут быть достигнуты; или исчезла необходимость в проекте. Характеристика «временный» также не относится к создаваемому в ходе проекта продукту, услуге или другому результату: большинство проектов предпринимается для достижения устойчивого, длительного результата. Основные отличия проекта от процесса: – процесс – периодически повторяется, описана деятельность по получению результата, четко определены роли подразделений; – проект – уникальный инновационный замысел, междисциплинарный характер, ограничения по срокам, бюджету. Характер ограничений формирует так называемый треугольник управления проектом, который состоит из трех переменных элементов, определяющих качество проекта: объём, стоимость и время (рис. 1.2). Он показывает, как эти три элемента связаны между собой: если изменить один, то придётся менять и два других, чтобы треугольник сошелся. При изменении какого-либо элемента без изменения одного или обоих других элементов пострадает качество проекта: «Вы можете иметь хорошее, быстрое или дешевое. Выберите два». Одна из задач управления проектами заключается в том, чтобы сбалансировать три вершины треугольника и обеспечить максимально высокое качество при соблюдении бюджета, сроков и требований проекта. Таким образом, из самого определения проекта следует его соответствие таким свойствам системы, как целостность, целеустремленность, коммуникативность. Свойство организованности требует реализации управления проектом. Рис. 1.2. Треугольник управления проектом Управление проектом (в соответствии со стандартом PMBОK) – область деятельности, в ходе которой определяются и достигаются четкие цели проекта при балансировании между объёмом работ, ресурсами (такими как деньги, труд, материалы, энергия, пространство и др.), временем, качеством и рисками. Структура управления проектами может различаться в зависимости от их специфики, но в каждом проекте должны быть определены следующие роли (рис. 1.3): – заказчик проекта – физическое или юридическое лицо, которое является владельцем результата проекта; – руководитель проекта – лицо, осуществляющее управление проектом и ответственное за результаты проекта; – куратор проекта – лицо, ответственное за обеспечение проекта ресурсами и осуществляющее административную, финансовую и иную поддержку проекта; – команда проекта – совокупность лиц, групп и организаций, объединенных во временную организационную структуру для выполнения работ проекта. Данная схема иллюстрирует соответствие практически всем системным свойствам: целостности, целесообразности, иерархичности, коммуникативности, организованности. Согласно Руководству к своду знаний по управлению проектами (PMBOK), выделяют пять групп процессов управления проектом, необходимых для любого проекта: – процессы инициирования – принятие решения о начале работ по проекту; – процессы планирования – определение и фиксация целей, планирование действий, необходимых для достижения целей и содержания, ради которых был предпринят проект; – процессы исполнения – объединение трудовых и других ресурсов для выполнения плана. – процессы мониторинга и контроля – регулярная оценка развития проекта, осуществление мониторинга для обнаружения отклонения от плана, при необходимости проведение корректирующих воздействий для достижения целей проекта; – процессы завершения – формализация приемки продукта, услуги или результата, подведение проекта к правильному завершению. Эти группы процессов, а также входящие в них процессы, обладают четкими зависимостями и выполняются в одной и той же последовательности в каждом проекте, определяя жизненный цикл управления проектом. Рис. 1.3. Схема управления проектом С позиций целостности проекта как системы важными являются еще два понятия проектного управления: – содержание проекта – наличие в проекте тех работ, которые необходимо выполнить, для того, чтобы получить желаемый результат. Содержанием нужно управлять и контролировать его на протяжении всего жизненного цикла проекта, следить за тем, чтобы в списке необходимых работ не появились лишние, не относящиеся к желаемому результату проекта, или относящиеся уже к другому проекту; – границы проекта (рис. 1.4) – данные о работах или событиях, являющихся началом и окончанием проекта, а также о работах входящих и не входящих в проект. Рис. 1.4. Границы проекта С позиций иерархичности, как и любая система, проект является частью надсистемы и может быть разделен на подсистемы. Наиболее близкими надсистемами для проекта являются: – программа – совокупность взаимосвязанных проектов и другой деятельности, направленных на достижение общей цели и реализуемых в условиях общих ограничений; – портфель – совокупность программ и проектов. Уровнем выше стоит предприятие (организация), для реализации стратегии развития которого и формируется портфель проектов. Подсистемами для проекта, например, являются: – работы проекта, которые также имеют иерархически упорядоченную структуру (структуру работ проекта); – области знаний по управлению проектом – определенные тематические области управления, составляющие общего успешного управления проектом. Эти и другие вопросы в области управления проектами будут рассмотрены в последующих темах курса. В итоге после изучения дисциплины «Основы проектной деятельности» вы сможете: – проводить бизнес-анализ, осуществлять обоснованный выбор проектной идеи и разрабатывать концепцию проекта (продукта); – осуществлять систематизацию и аргументировать выбор проектных решений; – выполнять планирование проекта по стадиям жизненного цикла, разрабатывать бизнес-модель и календарный график реализации проекта – оценивать ресурсы, необходимые для реализации проекта, обосновывать выбор источников финансирования; – оценивать экономические результаты и риски проекта, разрабатывать предложения по минимизации рисков; – составлять укрупненный бизнес-план проекта, готовить и проводить презентацию предпринимательского проекта; – анализировать возможности и риски создания технологического стартапа; – развить навыки командной работы и группового принятия решений, в том числе – в области решения нестандартных (креативных) задач. Бизнес-планирование в проектном управлении Бизнес – экономическая деятельность, направленная на получение прибыли. План – модель действий, созданная на основе прогнозирования экономической среды с учетом целей развития бизнеса. Бизнес-план – программа реализации проекта, содержащая сведения о компании, о продукте, о производстве, о рынках сбыта, о финансовом состоянии. Бизнес-план – документ, описывающий основные аспекты будущего предприятия, анализ проблем и рисков и способы их решения. Бизнес-план – инструмент технического, организационно-экономического, финансового, управленческого обоснования бизнеса. Бизнес-план – программа (модель) деятельности фирмы на определенный период. Бизнес-планирование – составная часть общей системы планирования в организации. Бизнес-планирование – процесс взаимной увязки функциональных и финансовых планов и процессов их разработки. Цели инициации бизнес-планирования: ● создание нового предприятия (start up); ● организация совместного предприятия; ● выпуск нового продукта или модификации существующего; ● инвестиции в основные фонды, увеличение производственных мощностей; ● финансовое оздоровление предприятия; ● первичное размещение акций или выпуск облигаций; ● ребрендинг компании; ● подготовка сделки по слиянию или поглощению; ● обеспечение выход фирмы на новый рынок; ● подготовка заявки на получение кредитов банков, государственных (муниципальных) дотаций и грантов. Задачи бизнес-планирования: ● определить направления деятельности компании, ее цели и целевые рынки; ● оценить компетенции компании, сильные и слабые стороны, рыночные возможности и угрозы; ● определить номенклатуру и атрибуты продукта, оценить издержки; ● оценить соответствие ресурсов фирмы поставленным целям и конъюнктуре рынка; ● определить состав маркетинговых мероприятий в рамках плана; ● определить мероприятия плана производства; ● оценить финансовое состояние фирмы и перспективы достижения финансовых целей. Существуют различные методики разработки бизнес-планов: ● Методика EBRD (Европейский банк реконструкции и развития); ● Методика KPMG (одна из ведущих консалтинговых компаний мирового уровня); ● Методика Tacis (образовательный проект Евросоюза для стран СНГ) ● По методике UNIDO (подразделение Организации объединенных наций) ● Методика Минэкономиразвития РФ Практически во всех методиках ключевыми разделами бизнес-плана являются: 1. Раздел маркетинга проекта (бизнес-плана). 2. Раздел: производство и реализация по проекту (бизнес-плану). 3. Финансовый раздел проекта (бизнес-плана). 4. Инвестиционный раздел проекта (бизнес-плана). МАРКЕТИНГОВЫЙ РАЗДЕЛ ПЛАНА: ПОИСК ИДЕЙ И СИТУАЦИОННЫЙ АНАЛИЗ ПРОБЛЕМ Преддверие разработки бизнес-плана предусматривает: Оценку текущего состояния бизнеса. 1. Оценка факторов внешней среды. 2. Оценка достигнутых показателей. Оценка предвидения, каким должен стать бизнес. 1. Миссия. 2. Цель и задачи плана. 3. Оценка конкурентных преимуществ. План достижения желаемого состояния. 1. Обоснование потребности в ресурсах. 2. Обоснование изменения структуры управления. 3. Обоснование рыночной конъюнктуры (маркетинг). Механизм ситуационного анализа, как начальный этап бизнес-планирования показан на рис. 1.5 Рис. 1.5 – Механизм ситуационного анализа, как начальный этап бизнес- планирования Шаблон бизнес-модели наглядно показывает то, каким образом компания монетизирует ценность для клиента, которая выражена в характеристиках продукта (см. рис. 1.6). В модели потребители, сегменты (1) – все лица и организации для которых создается ценность. Потребители обеспечивают поток доходов компании. Для каждого сегмента создается и описывается свое ценностное предложение (4) – совокупность товаров, услуг, сервиса и других ценностей, которые фирма создает или планирует создавать для потребителей. Каналы продвижения и распределения (3) описывает, как потребители узнают о ценностном предложении и как они получают продукт, услугу, сервис или, как это должно быть. Конкретно – это описание процессов коммуникации и логистики. Отношения с потребителями (2) описывают тип и характер отношений, которые установлены или, которые необходимо установить с потребителями или клиентами, а также то, как фирма организует и поддерживает такие отношения. Рис. 1.6 – Шаблон бизнес-модели предприятия (проекта) Ценностные предложения фирмы обеспечивают поток поступления доходов (9) от потребителей. Блок ключевые ресурсы (6) описывает материально-техническую базу и другие ресурсы, которые есть или должны быть созданы для реализации проектируемой бизнес-модели. Ключевые бизнес-процессы (5) – это значимые виды деятельности, которые описывают те функции и типы работ, которые компания способна или должна выполнять на очень высоком уровне. Ключевые партнеры (7) – это лица, которые могут помочь в продвижении бизнес- идеи, ценностного предложения и бизнес-модели в целом, часто – аутсорсеры. Когда мы имеем информацию о процессах, партнерах и ресурсах компании, мы можем описать структуру расходов (8). Правая часть модели (блоки 1, 2, 3, 4, 9) показывает то, что связывает фирму с внешней средой и видно потребителям. Левая часть модели (блоки 5, 6, 7, 8) описывает то, что потребителю не видно и что он не может оценить, но, что качественно влияет на создаваемую для него ценность. Для формулирования стратегии компания проводит анализ влияния факторов внутренней и внешней среды. Часто для этого используется методика SWOT- анализа и другие методы стратегического анализа. Характеристика и оценка состояния внутренней среды проводится на основе данных о проблемах и преимуществах компании, выявленных в ходе: анализа финансово-хозяйственной деятельности, GAP-анализа (анализ стратегического разрыва), бизнес-моделирования, позиционирования, портфельного и других видов стратегического анализа факторов внутренней среды. Оценка состояния внешней среды проводится на основе данных о возможностях и угрозах, которые предопределяются в ходе: анализа 5 сил конкуренции (М. Портера, конкурентного анализ, сегментации, PEST-анализа (анализ политических, экономических, социальных, технологических, экологических факторов макросреды) и других видов стратегического анализа. По результатам выявления факторов влияния строят SWOT-матрицу (рис. 1.7). Рис. 1.7 – SWOT-матрица ОРГАНИЗАЦИОННЫЙ РАЗДЕЛ БИЗНЕС-ПЛАНА Основой организационного раздела бизнес-плана являются сформулированные в ходе SWOT-анализа стратегии предприятия детализированные в укрупненных задачах развития (8 этап SWOT-анализа). На следующем этапе приступают к построению дерева целей и сбалансированной системы показателей (см. рис. 1.8 и табл. 1.1). Рис. 1.8 – Стратегическая карта развития предприятия, стартапа, проекта Дерево целей – это диаграмма, которая описывает стратегию в виде набора целей (задач) и причинно-следственных связей между ними. Часто дерево целей оформляют в виде стратегической карты, на которой наглядно объединяют информацию о стратегических целях и краткосрочных задачах, стоящих перед подразделением или компанией в проекте (в программе или в портфеле проектов), о стимулах, показателях, которые комплексно рассматриваются в четырех аспектах: ● Финансы. ● Отношения с потребителями. ● Организация внутренних бизнес-процессов. ● Компетенции, обучение и развитие. Стратегическая карта наглядно показывает каким образом предполагается достигать поставленные цели, какой набор задач и отдельных мероприятий необходимо для этого выполнить. Сбалансированная система показателей, инструментом которой является и стратегическая карта, разрабатывается, как для системы в целом (предприятие, подразделение, проект и т.п.), так и для отдельных сотрудников. Важнейшими характеристиками сбалансированной системы показателей являются: ● акцент на стратегическом управлении; ● отбор ограниченного числа контролируемых показателей; сочетание финансовых и нефинансовых данных. Таблица 1.1 – Сбалансированная система показателей развития предприятия, проекта Весь проект и любая его часть могут быть выполнены только в процессе согласованной, скоординированной деятельности участников. Состав и порядок реализации работ во многом определяет форму организационной структуры, создаваемой для достижения целей проекта. Рассмотренные выше предварительные этапы работ формируют данные для формализации календарного графика и привязки необходимых ресурсов к задачам проекта (см. табл. 1.2). Таблица 1.2 – Календарный график с привязкой к задачам проекта необходимых ресурсов Продолжение таблицы 1.2 – Календарный график (диаграмма Гантта) и расчет потребности в инвестициях по этапам проекта Данные для планирования этапов проекта служат основой для разработки: ● календарного и организационного планов проекта, построения диаграммы Гантта с привязкой ресурсов; ● финансового плана и экономического обоснования проекта. Экономическое содержание проектного управления Важную роль в методологии проектного управления имеют экономические аспекты его реализации. В общем виде экономическая модель проекта показывает распределение результатов и затрат по стадиям проекта в соответствии с иерархической структурой работ. Экономическая модель служит инструментом ресурсного обеспечения и является основой создания плановых документов, регламентирующих привлечение и распределение ресурсов в ходе проекта. Создание экономической модели проекта является необходимым требованием к управлению ею. Недостаточно тщательно проработанная экономическая модель может привести к недостижению запланированного эффекта от реализации вследствие недостаточного ресурсного обеспечения ли несоблюдения сроков выполнения отдельных этапов. Как правило, экономическая модель утверждается внутри команды проекта и согласовывается с инвесторами. Важным условием создания экономической модели является соблюдение принципа альтернативности:  результаты конкретного проекта сравниваются с ситуацией, когда проект осуществляться не будет («с проектом» - «без проекта»);  результаты конкретного проекта сравниваются с результатами других проектов, доступных организации («с другим проектом»). Разработка экономической модели проекта предусматривает выполнение следующих действий: 1. обоснование целей проекта на основе изучения рынка и анализа производственных резервов, 2. предварительную оценку стоимости проекта и прогноз увеличения оборотного капитала, 3. оценку продолжительности инвестиционного процесса и собственно реализации проекта, срока начала эксплуатации проекта, 4. прогноз увеличения капитала от реализации проекта, 5. определение источников (инвесторов) и размер финансирования, 6. определение основных характеристик проекта. Характеристики проекта, которые имеют значимость при определении экономических параметров включают в себя:  наличие альтернативных технических решений,  спрос на продукции проекта,  продолжительность проекта, в том числе его инвестиционной фазы,  оценка уровня базовых, текущих и прогнозных цен на продукцию или услуг проекта,  перспектив экспорта продукции проекта,  сложность проекта,  объем и состав нормативной и проектно-сметной документации,  инвестиционный климат в районе реализации проекта,  соотношение затрат и результатов проекта Экономическая модель разрабатывается на самых ранних стадиях, и по мере развития проекта ее параметры будут требовать уточнения. Как правило, экономическая модель конкретизируется и представляется в таких документах, так предварительное технико-экономическое обоснование, бизнес-план, бюджет проекта. Однако управление стоимостью проекта заключается не только в формировании экономической модели. В соответствии со стандартами управления проектами;  «Управление стоимостью (затратами) проекта (Project Cost Management) объединяет процессы, выполняемые в ходе планирования, разработки бюджета и контролирования затрат, обеспечивающие завершение проекта в рамках утвержденного бюджета». PMBOK  «Управление стоимостью и финансированием проекта (Project Cost and Finance Management) — раздел управления проектами, включающий процессы, необходимые для формирования и контроля выполнения утвержденного бюджета проекта». НТК (Национальные требования к компетентности специалистов) Важной особенностью процессов управления стоимостью проекта является их очень тесная связь с иными процессами планирования. В частности, сложно предположить, что удастся разработать корректный бюджет, не имея информации о необходимых ресурсах и без календарного плана. Информация о рисках проекта также может значительно повлиять как на величину, так и на структуру проекта. Одним из первых шагов, выполняемых менеджером проекта в ходе управления стоимостью проекта, является разработка концепции управления стоимостью. Эта концепция должна содержать общие правила организации управления затратами проекта, принципы учета и документирования, рекомендуемые методики и технологии. Разработка концепции управления стоимостью и финансированием проекта:  выработка стратегии управления стоимостью и финансами проекта (определение целей и задач, критериев успеха и неудач, ограничений и допущений);  проведение экономического анализа и обоснования проекта (маркетинг, оценка стоимости и источников финансирования, прогноз выполнения);  общая экономическая оценка проекта;  разработка укрупненного графика финансирования;  определение требований к системе управления стоимостью и финансированием в проекте;  утверждение концепции. Процесс управления стоимостью проекта обеспечивается за счет реализации в ходе проекта следующих процессов: I. Оценки стоимости; II. Разработки бюджета проекта; III. Контроля стоимости проекта. 1. Оценка стоимости работ. Существуют различные методы и инструменты стоимостной оценки. Они различаются точностью и условиями применения. Оценка стоимости — итеративный процесс получения прогнозных и фактических данных о стоимости работ и ресурсов. Оценки могут уточняться по ходу проекта. Допустимая погрешность оценок зависит от назначения получаемых данных и от фазы проекта. Выделяются четыре типа оценок:  грубый порядок величины;  порядок величины;  бюджетная;  точная. Каждая последующая оценка должна быть точнее предыдущей. 2. Разработка смет и бюджета. Смета — документ, содержащий перечень затрат проекта, полученных на основе объемов работ проекта, требуемых ресурсов и цен, структурированный по статьям. Проецируя смету на ось времени, т. е. добавляя в документ информацию о сроках, когда будут израсходованы планируемые средства, команда проекта получает бюджет проекта. Бюджет — важнейший финансовый документ проекта. Разработать точный, полный и реальный бюджет с первой попытки практически невозможно. Бюджет уточняется и корректируется по ходу проекта. Разработка бюджета проекта завершается фиксацией его эталонного варианта — базового бюджета проекта. Именно он и должен быть утвержден заказчиком. 3. Контроль стоимости проекта. Контроль бюджета может осуществляться различными способами. Один из популярнейших методов контроля стоимости, применяемых при управлении проектом, — метод освоенного объема. В отличие от традиционных методов контроля стоимости метод освоенного объема позволяет учитывать при анализе не только стоимостные, но и объемные показатели выполнения работ. Для определения структуры сметы и бюджета проекта необходимо определиться с видами затрат, которые в рамках проектного управления могут быть разделены на группы: 1. обязательства; 2. бюджетные затраты; 3. фактические затраты. Обязательства — это плановые, будущие затраты, которые возникают при заключении договоров, контрактов, заказе каких-либо товаров или услуг. Обычно это происходит заранее согласно плану проекта. Счета, выставляемые поставщиками, подлежат обязательной оплате. Однако оплата может производиться по различным правилам в различные моменты времени:  в момент готовности материалов и комплектующих;  после поставки товаров и услуг;  на условиях полной или частичной предоплаты;  согласно политике организации, закупающей или предоставляющей товары и услуги. В зависимости от того, как организован учет в организации, можно раньше или позже произвести документальное уменьшение бюджета на сумму обязательств. В некоторых организациях данные затраты не учитываются до момента получения счета или его оплаты. В таком случае текущее состояние бюджета проекта доступно менеджеру в искаженном виде и не дает полноценной картины для принятия решений. Бюджетные затраты представляют собой сметную стоимость работ, распределенную во времени. Это график расходов проекта. Иногда его называют планом затрат. Он содержит информацию о величине и сроках планируемых расходов проекта при производстве работ. Фактические затраты показывают реальный отток денежной наличности в проекте. Отчет о фактических затратах содержит информацию о реальных расходах проекта. При этом они могут произойти:  во время выполнения работ проекта;  в момент выплаты денежных средств;  в момент списания денежных средств со счета. Особенности учета обязательств, бюджетных и фактических затрат могут значительно изменить картину, по которой определяется финансовое состояние проекта. Примеры В ходе проекта строительства установки осушки попутного газа на нефтяном месторождении были заказаны толстостенные котлы на заводе- изготовителе. Бюджет проекта уменьшен на сумму 4 500 000 руб. в связи с тем, что после заключения договора и заказа котлов возникли обязательства на данную сумму. Срок изготовления котлов семь месяцев, однако данные затраты уже учтены в бюджете проекта. Другой пример. В договоре поставки оборудования для проекта прокладки волоконно-оптической линии в интересах компании — оператора сотовой связи была предусмотрена оплата поставленного маршрутизатора в течение 30 дней после подписания актов приемки. Согласно правилам учета компании-заказчика эти затраты будут учтены в бюджете только по факту реальной оплаты. Таким образом, сложилась ситуация, когда работы уже выполнены, оборудование на складе заказчика, а затраты по ним еще не учтены в фактическом бюджете. Для повышения эффективности системы управления затратами проекта в концепции управления стоимостью и финансированием проекта желательно четко определить:  политику оплаты работ (предоплата, оплата по факту и др.);  политику оплаты счетов (в день получения, в течение определенного срока и др.);  принципы списания затрат на рабочую силу, материалы и комплектующие;  принципы учета затрат в проекте;  принципы оплаты работ при привлечении субподрядных организаций;  взаимосвязь графика выполнения работ и списания затрат на рабочую силу и оплату механизмов. Помимо процессов управления стоимостью проекта в целях обеспечения его успешной реализации также необходимо определить и контролировать индикаторы эффективности проекта. Такая оценка на разных этапах проекта имеет свои особенности. Таблица – Задачи экономической оценки проекта по этапам его жизненного цикла Этап проекта Задачи оценки Методы оценки Подготовительный Определение целесообразности и реализуемости проектных решений Прогноз экономической эффективности финансовых потоков проекта Реализация проекта Мониторинг реализации проекта, выявление отклонений, корректировка плановых показателей Контроль исполнения плановых показателей Завершение проекта Подведение итогов, оценка эффективности проекта Экономическая оценка фактически полученных результатов В качестве индикаторов эффективности выступают показатели, характеризующие: 1) Денежные потоки проекта. В ходе реализации любой проект генерирует денежные потоки, которые отражают действия, которые выполняются в ходе проекта. При этом потоки группируются по видам деятельности в соответствии с назначением этих потоков:  денежные потоки по инвестиционной деятельности отражают операции по созданию (строительству или реконструкции), приобретению или продаже основных фондов (зданий, сооружений, оборудования, транспортных средств и т.д), а также изменению оборотного капитала (запасов на складе, незавершенного производства) в связи с осуществлением работ по проекту);  денежные потоки по операционной деятельности отражают операции текущей деятельности по производству продукции на этапе эксплуатации объекта, созданного в результате проекта;  денежные потоки по финансовой деятельности формируются в связи с необходимостью обслуживания ресурсов, привлекаемых в проект на условиях кредитования, акционирования или иных. Таблица – Денежные потоки проекта Вид деятельност и приток отток Инвестицио нная Продажа активов, Высвобождение оборотных средств, Доходы от инвестиций в ценные бумаги Приобретение основных средств и НМА, Вложение в прирост оборотных средств и дополнительные фонды, Ликвидационные затраты Операционн ая (производс твенная) Выручка от продажи товаров, работ и услуг, Внереализационные доходы Платежи за сырье, материалы, комплектующие изделия, покупные полуфабрикаты, Платежи за топливо и электроэнергию, Заработная плата персонала с отчислениями, Выплата процентов по кредитам, Налоги Финансовая Продажа ценных бумаг, Заемный и привлеченный капитал Выплата процентов по кредитам, Выплата дивидендов, Погашение обязательств по привлеченному капиталу Интегральными показателями, характеризующими денежные потоки проекта являются: I. Поток реальных денег – разность между притоком и оттоком денежных средств от инвестиционной и операционной деятельности в каждом периоде осуществления проекта II. Сальдо реальных денег – разность между притоком и оттоком денежных средств от всех трех видов деятельности. Необходимым критерием принятия проекта является положительное сальдо накопленных реальных денег. Отрицательная величина сальдо накопленных реальных денег свидетельствует о необходимости привлечения в проект дополнительных собственных или заемных средств и отражения этих средств в расчетах эффективности. 2) Показатели экономического эффекта отражают результаты проекта, выраженные в натуральных, условно-натуральных и стоимостных единицах измерения. Определяются как для отдельных участников проекта, так и в отношении проекта в целом. К таким показателям могут быть отнесены:  конечные производственные результаты (выручка от реализации, выручка от продажи имущества и интеллектуальной собственности и иные виды доходов);  социальные и экологические результаты, рассчитанные исходя из совместного воздействия всех участников проекта на здоровье населения, социальную и экологическую обстановку в регионах (создание новых рабочих мест, рост производительности труда, снижение вредных выбросов, снижение числа заболевших, рост пассажиропотока и т.д.);  прямые финансовые результаты (прибыль или убыток от реализации проекта);  кредиты и займы иностранных государств, банков и фирм, поступления от импортных пошлин и т.п. Показатели экономического эффекта отражают тот результат, который получен в ходе выполнения отдельных операций проекта или в целом по его завершении. 3) Показатели экономической эффективности. В качестве относительных показателей эффективности проекта могут быть использованы любые индикаторы, позволяющие сравнить результаты (например, полученный доход или сокращение временных затрат) проекта с затратами, которые были понесены для достижения этого результата. Эффективность = Результат / Затраты, Особое значение имеют показатели эффективности, которые в качестве результата используют значение прибыли. Такие показатели называют рентабельностью и для оценки проекта могут использоваться:  рентабельность продаж,  рентабельность производства,  рентабельность активов,  рентабельность собственного капитала и т.д. Показатели рентабельности отражают конечную экономическую эффективность проекта как величину прибыли, которую генерирует проект по отношению к ресурсам, задействованным в проекте. 4) Показатели экономической инвестиционных эффективности. Для оценки результатов проектов, имеющих длительный период реализации применяют так называемые динамические методы, отражающие влияние временных параметров на изменение стоимости денег. Такое влияние выражается не только в наличии инфляции, но и иных факторов, которые определяют как направление изменения стоимости денег с течением времени (уменьшение их ценности), так и скорость этого изменения, которая может быть разной для различных инвестиционных проектов. Суть данных процессов изложена в Концепции временной стоимости денег и при определении эффективности проектов выражается в необходимости пересчета (дисконтирования, приведения к современного моменту времени) всех денежных потоков, связанных с проектом. К основным показателям динамических методов оценки относятся:  чистый дисконтированный доход (ЧДД) или интегральный эффект;  индекс доходности (ИД);  внутренняя норма доходности (ВНД);  срок окупаемости (СО);  другие показатели, отражающие интересы участников или специфику проекта. Оценка эффективности и результативности проекта предусматривает разработку комплекса индикаторов из каждой группы наиболее полно отражающих специфику и цели проекта.","completion":"Как я могу помочь с информацией, основанной на предоставленном конспекте?"},{"prompt":"SWOTматрица это: Вопрос 1 Выберите один ответ: таблица, предназначенная для анализа факторов внешней и внутренней среды и выбора бизнесстратегии диаграмма, которая описывает стратегию в виде набора целей (задач) проекта и причинноследственных связей между ними таблица, определяющая ответственность исполнителей задач проекта","completion":"SWOT-матрица это: таблица, предназначенная для анализа факторов внешней и внутренней среды и выбора бизнес-стратегии"},{"prompt":"Для каких целей предприятие разрабатывает бизнесмодель?
