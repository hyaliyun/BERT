Therefore, we have: [ angle NDC = angle BAC = alpha quad text{and} quad angle MEA = angle BCA = gamma ] 2. Consider the right triangles (AME) and (AEC): - For triangle (AME), by definition: [ ME = AE cdot cos(gamma) ] - For triangle (AEC), we know: [ AE = AC cdot cos(alpha) ] - Thus, combining the above, we get: [ ME = AC cdot cos(alpha) cdot cos(gamma) ] 3.

Let's describe the steps in detail: Step 1: Initial Considerations - We have a chain of 7 silver rings. - The traveler is allowed to cut only one ring to make the daily payments. - We need to ensure that the traveler can give the exact number of rings to the hotel owner each day. Step 2: Strategy To achieve this, the traveler can cut the third ring in the chain. This results in three separate chains: 1. A single ring (1 ring). 2. A chain of two rings (2 rings). 3. A chain of four rings (4 rings), made by removing the third ring. Consequently, this enables the traveler to produce different combinations to make the payment for each day without cutting any additional rings. Step 3: Detailed Daily Transactions 1. **Day 1:** - The traveler gives 1 ring to the hotel owner. 2. **Day 2:** - The traveler gives the chain of 2 rings to the hotel owner. - The hotel owner returns the single ring (from Day 1). Result: Hotel owner has 2 rings, and the traveler retains 1 ring. 3. **Day 3:** - The traveler gives the single ring again. Result: Hotel owner has 3 rings (1 ring + 2 rings). 4. **Day 4:** - The traveler gives the chain of 4 rings to the hotel owner. - The hotel owner returns the chain of 2 rings and the single ring. Result: Hotel owner has 4 rings (1 ring + 3 rings), and the traveler retains 2 rings. 5. **Day 5:** - The traveler gives the single ring again. Result: Hotel owner has 5 rings (1 ring + 4 rings). 6. **Day 6:** - The traveler gives the chain of 2 rings to the hotel owner. - The hotel owner returns the single ring.

This gives us: [ AM perp BC ] Hence, ( angle AMC = angle AMB = 90^circ ). 2. We know point ( P ) satisfies ( PB < PC ) and ( PA parallel BC ). Since ( PA parallel BC ), ( angle PAM = angle AMC = 90^circ ). 3. Let's consider points ( X ) and ( Y ) which lie on the extended lines of ( PB ) and ( PC ) respectively. Given that ( angle PXM = angle PYM ). 4. Suppose point ( Z ) lies on the extended line ( AM ) such that ( ZY perp PY ). This means: [ angle PAZ = angle PYZ = 90^circ ] Consequently, the points ( P, A, Y, Z ) are concyclic, meaning they lie on the circumference of the same circle. 5. Furthermore, since ( ZY perp PY ), therefore ( angle CMZ = angle CYZ = 90^circ ). This implies that points ( C, Y, Z, M ) are also concyclic. 6. Hence, because ( C, Y, Z, M ) are concyclic: [ angle CZM = angle CYM ] 7. Given that ( angle PXM = angle PYM ), and noting that points ( B, C ) are symmetric about ( AM ), it follows that: [ angle BZM = angle CZM = angle CYM = angle BXM ] Thus, the points ( B, X, Z, M ) are concyclic. 8. Since ( angle BXZ = 180^circ - angle BMZ = 90^circ ), it follows that: [ angle PXZ = angle PYZ = angle PAZ = 90^circ ] 9. This demonstrates that points ( P, A, Y, Z, X ) are all concyclic. 10. Therefore, since ( P, A, Y, Z, X ) lie on the same circle, it naturally follows that: [ A, P, X, Y quad text{are concyclic}. ] # Conclusion: {boxed{A, P, X, Y text{ are concyclic. }}}"},{"prompt":"Spinners C and D are spun.

(Note that one may swap two adjacent identical letters, leaving a word unchanged.) *Romania (Dan Schwarz)*","completion":"To prove that if a word has the property that swapping any two adjacent letters makes the word repetitive, then all its letters are identical, we will proceed by contradiction. Assume that there exists a word ( w = w_1 w_2 cdots w_n ) that has the property but not all its letters are identical. 1. **Definitions and Initial Setup:** - A swap ( s ) is called *impactful* if it changes the word ( w ). - Let ( s(w) ) denote the word after applying the swap ( s ). - A word is *drab* if it consists of repetitions of a single letter. - Define the period ( p(x) ) of a word ( x ) as the smallest integer ( p ) such that ( x ) can be written as the concatenation of ( p ) identical subwords. - Define the length ( ell(x) ) of a word ( x ) as the number of letters in ( x ). - Define ( r(x) = frac{ell(x)}{p(x)} ), the length of the subwords. - For a word ( x ), let ( overline{x}_1, overline{x}_2, ldots, overline{x}_{p(x)} ) be the ( p(x) ) subwords of length ( r(x) ). - Define the diversity ( d(x) ) of a word ( x ) as the number of impactful swaps in ( x ) plus 1, which is also equal to the number of drab words that partition ( x ). 2. **Claim 1:** For any impactful swap ( s ), ( d(s(x)) ge d(x) - 2 ), with equality if and only if ( s(x) ) swaps the middle ( ab ) in a word ( baba ). **Proof:** Suppose the two letters ( s ) swaps are ( a ) and ( b ), and the letter before ( a ) is ( c ), and the letter after ( b ) is ( d ). The rest of the word remains unchanged, so the difference ( d(s(x)) - d(x) ) is equal to the difference ( d(cabd) - d(cbad) ). The first is at most 3, and the second at least 1 since ( b ne a ), and it is 1 only when ( c = b ) and ( d = a ). (blacksquare) 3. **Claim 2:** For any repetitive word ( x ), if ( d(x) > 1 ) then ( d(x) ge 2p(x) ), with equality if and only if ( d(x) ) is of the form ( uvuv ldots uv ), repeated ( p(x) ) times, where ( u ) and ( v ) are words. **Proof:** Consider ( overline{x}_i ); if the last letter is equal to the first, then the number of drab words that partition ( x ) is equal to ( p(x) cdot d(overline{x}_1) - p(x) + 1 ). It is impossible for ( d(overline{x}_1) = 2 ) since it begins and ends on the same letter, so ( d(x) ne p(x) + 1 ). If the last letter is not the same as the first, then ( d(x) = p(x) cdot d(overline{x}_1) ). We cannot have ( d(overline{x}_1) = 1 implies d(x) = 1 ), so ( d(x) ) is at least ( 2p(x) ), with equality when ( d(overline{x}_1) = 2 ). (blacksquare) 4. **Claim 3:** - If ( k ge 3 ), ( m(k) le 1 ). - If ( k = 2 ), ( m(k) le 2 ). - ( m(2) + m(4) le 2 ). **Proof:** - If ( k ge 5 ), observe that one swap ( s ) can change at most two of the ( p(s(w)) ) induced subwords. Consider two swaps ( s_1, s_2 ), with ( p(s_1(w)) = p(s_2(w)) ); by pigeonhole, there must exist a subword ( overline{w}_k ) that is kept constant. Then this forces ( w = s_1(w) = s_2(w) ) so we cannot have two such words. - If ( k = 4 ), consider two different swaps ( s_1, s_2 ). If one of them is completely within a subword, then there will exist a subword (out of 4 subwords total) which is kept constant, contradiction. Furthermore, one swap has to be in between the first and second subword (WLOG ( s_1 )), and another has to be within the third and fourth subword (WLOG ( s_2 )), so ( w ) looks like this: ( xa ~ by ~ zb ~ aw ), where ( x, y, z, w ) are words. Yet this also means that ( s_1(w) = xb ~ ay ~ zb ~ aw ), so ( y ) must end with ( b ), and that ( s_2(w) = xa ~ by ~ za ~ bw ), so ( y ) must end with ( a ), and thus ( a = b ), contradiction. - If ( k = 3 ), again consider two different swaps ( s_1, s_2 ). If one of them is completely within a subword (WLOG ( s_1 ), and WLOG this is the first subword), then the other must be in between the other two subwords (WLOG ( s_2 )) or else there will be a constant subword (when we look at 3 subwords partitioning ( w )). Then ( s_2(w) ) will look like this ( x ~ yb ~ az ) where ( w ) is ( x ~ ya ~ bz ), so actually ( w ) is of the form ( bx'a ~ by'b ~ az'a ), where ( x, y, z, x', y', z' ) are all words. But then any swap within the first subword won't change the fact that the other two subwords end in different letters, so it doesn't work. The other case is when both are between subwords, WLOG ( s_1 ) is in between the first and second subword and ( s_2 ) is in between the second and third subword. Then ( w ) has to look something like this: ( xb ~ aya ~ bz ), and ( s_1(w) ) looks like ( xa ~ bya ~ bz ) (so ( x ) begins with ( a )) and ( s_2(w) ) looks like ( xb ~ ayb ~ az ) (so ( x ) begins with ( a )), contradiction. - If ( k = 2 ), if we have two swaps entirely within the same subword, then the other subword is constant, contradiction (here we have ( k = 2 ) subwords partitioning ( w )). Thus we can have at most one swap per subword and one more swap in between the subword. Suppose we have a swap ( s_1 ) within a subword (WLOG, the first subword) and a swap ( s_2 ) between subwords. Then we have something like ( w = xa ~ by ) and ( s_2(w) = xb ~ ay ), so ( w = ax'a ~ by'b ). Then the swap ( s_1 ), in order to make the subwords the same, must both make the first letter of the first subword into ( b ), and the last letter of the first subword into ( b ), which is impossible. Therefore we can have just at most one swap within each of the two subwords and two swaps total. - For the last part, note that a swap ( s ) with ( p(s(w)) = 4 ) can actually be included as part of the argument in the last part (as it *does* divide ( w ) into two equal subwords), so ( m(4) ) should actually be included in the count. (blacksquare) 5. **Maximizing ( p(S(w)) ):** Now consider a swap ( S ) which maximizes ( p(S(w)) ). Suppose ( p(S(w)) ge 4 ). [ p(S(w)) - 1 ge 2 + 1 + sum_{k = 5}^{p(S(w))} 1 ] [ ge (m(2) + m(4)) + m(3) + sum_{k = 5}^{p(S(w))} m(k) ] [ = sum_{k = 2}^{p(S(w))} m(k) ] [ = d(w) - 1 ] [ ge d(S(w)) - 3 ] [ ge 2p(S(w)) - 3 ] or ( p(S(w)) le 2 ), contradiction. 6. **Case ( p(S(w)) = 3 ):** When ( p(S(w)) = 3 ), the same inequality becomes ( 3 ge 2p(S(w)) - 3 ) or ( p(S(w)) le 3 ) -- however, this is the equality case, so all of the following must hold: - ( m(2) = 2 ), - ( m(3) = 1 ), - ( d(w) = d(S(w)) - 2 ); i.e. around ( S(w) ), ( w ) looks like ( abab ), - ( d(S(w)) = 2p(S(w)) ). By the last, we see that ( S(w) = uvuvuv ) for words ( u ) and ( v ). By the third, we will require that ( u ) and ( v ) both have length 1, and then by manual inspection we can conclude that it's impossible for ( m(2) = 2 ) as well. Therefore, ( p(S(w)) ne 3 ), so ( p(S(w)) = 2 ). 7. **Case ( p(S(w)) = 2 ):** If ( m(2) = 2 ), then ( w ) looks something like this: ( xaby ~ xbay ). There must be no more possible swaps. In order for the first subword to have no more impactful swaps, ( x ) is a drab word consisting only of ( a )s and ( y ) is a drab word consisting only of ( b )s, yet in order for the second subword to have no more impactful swaps, ( x ) is a drab word consisting only of ( b )s and ( y ) is a drab word consisting only of ( a )s, which doesn't work unless ( x, y ) both have length 0.

Since angle C A B = 60^circ and angle C A Y = 90^circ (because of the square), we have: [ begin{aligned} angle B A Y & = angle C A Y - angle C A B & = 90^circ - 60^circ & = 30^circ. end{aligned} ] 3. **Considering Diagonals of Squares:** - Since A Z is a diagonal of the square A Y Z C, the angle angle Z A Y is 45^circ because diagonals of a square bisect its angles. - Similarly, since A X is a diagonal of the square A W X B, the angle angle B A X is also 45^circ. 4. **Calculating (angle Z A X):** - Next, we calculate the angle angle Z A X as follows: [ begin{aligned} angle Z A X & = angle Z A Y - angle B A Y + angle B A X & = 45^circ - 30^circ + 45^circ & = 60^circ. end{aligned} ] 5. **Equal Sides Due to Equal Diagonals:** - Since triangle A B C is equilateral, the lengths of A B and A C are equal.

An affine function is of the form (f(x) = ax + b) where (a, b in mathbb{R}). A function (g(x)) is convex if for all (x, y in mathbb{R}) and (0 leq lambda leq 1): [ g(lambda x + (1 - lambda) y) leq lambda g(x) + (1 - lambda) g(y). ] Steps to find the largest and smallest values of (|S|): 1. **Initial Definitions and Considerations:** Suppose (g in S). For (i=1, 2, ldots, n), let [ X_i = {x in mathbb{R} : g(x) = f_i(x)}. ] 2. **Claim about (X_i):** Claim: If (|X_i| geq 3), then (X_i) is an interval. *Explanation:* If there exist three points (a < b < c) such that ( (a, g(a)), (b, g(b)), (c, g(c)) ) are collinear, then (g) must be linear on ( [a, b] ) and hence linear on the interval containing (a, b, c) due to the convexity of (g(x)). From this, if (g(x)) coincides with (f_i(x)) over three or more points, (f_i(x)) must define (g(x)) over an interval. 3. **Defining (T):** Let’s define (T = { i : |X_i| geq 3 }). 4. **Proving (g(x) = max_{i in T} f_i(x)):** We aim to show that: [ g(x) = max_{i in T} f_i(x). ] Firstly, since (g(x)) is convex and for all (i in T), (g(x) geq f_i(x)), it follows that: [ g(x) geq max_{i in T} f_i(x). ] Suppose for contradiction, there exists (y in mathbb{R}) such that: [ g(y) neq max_{i in T} f_i(y). ] Thus, for all (i in T), (g(y) > f_i(y)). By the continuity of convex functions, there exists a neighborhood (U) around (y) such that for all (z in U): [ g(z) > f_i(z) quad forall i in T. ] For each (z in U), let (j) be such that (f_j(z) = g(z)). Since (U) is infinite and the set of indices (j) is finite, there must exist some (j) such that this equality holds for at least three points within (U). This would imply: [ j in T quad text{so that} quad g(z) > f_j(z), ] leading to a contradiction. Hence, (g(y) = max_{i in T} f_i(y)). 5. **Largest Value of (|S|):** Since (T) can be any non-empty subset of ({1, 2, ldots, n}), there are (2^n - 1) possible non-empty subsets. Thus, (|S| leq 2^n - 1). This upper bound is achievable. For example, if the affine functions are tangents to the graph of (y = x^2), each subset (T) generates a distinct convex function: [ g(x) = max_{i in T} f_i(x). ] Hence, the largest possible value of (|S|) is (2^n - 1). [ boxed{2^n - 1} ] 6. **Smallest Value of (|S|):** To find the lower bound, note that (S) contains at least the (n) distinct affine functions (f_i), and the maxima of pairs ( max(f_i, f_j) ). For (1 leq i < j leq n), these are pairwise distinct due to the non-parallel and non-concurrent conditions. Thus, (S) has at least: [ n + binom{n}{2} = n + frac{n(n-1)}{2} = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] distinct functions. This lower bound is exemplified by affine functions like tangents to the graph of (y = -x^2), ordered by gradients to ensure no further elements of (S). Therefore, the smallest value of (|S|) is (boxed{frac{n(n+1)}{2}}). In conclusion, the largest possible value of (|S|) is (2^n - 1) and the smallest possible value is (frac{n(n+1)}{2})."},{"prompt":"a plane, a slanted line segment is twice the length of its projection on the plane.

We're given that L = 2l. We can set up a right triangle where L is the hypotenuse, l is the base, and the height is perpendicular to the plane. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the relationship between the hypotenuse L, the projection l, and the height h of this right triangle is L^2 = l^2 + h^2. However, we know that L = 2l, so we can substitute into the equation, resulting in (2l)^2 = l^2 + h^2, which simplifies to 4l^2 = l^2 + h^2. Rearranging the terms, we get 3l^2 = h^2, or frac{h^2}{l^2} = 3. Taking the square root of both sides gives us frac{h}{l} = sqrt{3}. In a right triangle, tan of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. Therefore, for the angle theta between the line segment L and the plane, we have tan(theta) = frac{h}{l}. Therefore, tan(theta) = sqrt{3}. We recognize that tan(60^circ) = sqrt{3}, thus theta = 60^circ. So, the angle between the slanted line and the plane is 60^circ.

Let ( X ) be an arbitrary point on the circumcircle of the ( 2n )-gon ( A_1A_2ldots A_{2n} ). - Let ( g ) be an arbitrary line in the plane, and for every integer ( i ) such that ( 1 leq i leq 2n ), let ( u_i = measuredangle(A_iA_{i+1}; g) ). The indices are cyclic modulo ( 2n ), so ( A_{2n+1} = A_1 ) and ( u_{2n+1} = u_1 ). - For every index ( i ), we have: [ u_i - u_{i+1} = measuredangle(A_iA_{i+1}; g) - measuredangle(A_{i+1}A_{i+2}; g) = measuredangle(A_iA_{i+1}; A_{i+1}A_{i+2}) = measuredangle A_iA_{i+1}A_{i+2} ] - Since ( X ) lies on the circumcircle of the ( 2n )-gon, we have ( measuredangle A_iA_{i+1}A_{i+2} = measuredangle A_iXA_{i+2} ). Thus, ( u_i - u_{i+1} = measuredangle A_iXA_{i+2} ) for every ( i ). 4. **Summing the angles**: - Summing these differences for all ( i ) from ( 1 ) to ( 2n ), we get: [ sum_{i=1}^{2n} (u_i - u_{i+1}) = sum_{i=1}^{2n} measuredangle A_iXA_{i+2} ] - Since the sum of the directed angles around a point is ( 0^circ ), we have: [ sum_{i=1}^{2n} measuredangle A_iXA_{i+2} = 0^circ ] - Therefore: [ (u_1 + u_3 + ldots + u_{2n-1}) - (u_2 + u_4 + ldots + u_{2n}) = 0^circ ] [ u_1 + u_3 + ldots + u_{2n-1} = u_2 + u_4 + ldots + u_{2n} ] 5. **Using the parallel condition**: - Since ( n ) is odd, we can rewrite the sums as: [ (u_1 + u_3 + ldots + u_{n-2} + u_n) + (u_{n+2} + u_{n+4} + ldots + u_{2n-1}) = (u_2 + u_4 + ldots + u_{n-1}) + (u_{n+1} + u_{n+3} + ldots + u_{2n-2} + u_{2n}) ] - Given ( A_1A_2 parallel A_{n+1}A_{n+2} ), we have ( u_{n+1} = u_1 ), ( u_{n+2} = u_2 ), and so on. Thus: [ (u_1 + u_3 + ldots + u_{n-2} + u_n) + (u_2 + u_4 + ldots + u_{n-1}) = (u_1 + u_3 + ldots + u_{n-2} + u_n) + (u_2 + u_4 + ldots + u_{n-1}) ] - Most terms cancel out, leaving ( u_n = u_{2n} ), which implies ( measuredangle(A_nA_{n+1}; g) = measuredangle(A_{2n}A_1; g) ).

However, ( a_{k} = 5 ) would imply that we have the same number ( k ) occurring five times among the five values, which is not feasible for multiple ( k ). 2. Establish constraints based on total counts: We know the sums: [ a_{0} + a_{1} + a_{2} + a_{3} + a_{4} = 5 ] This implies that there are five numbers ( a_{0}, a_{1}, ldots, a_{4} ). 3. Set up a second equation based on values: Each value from 0 to 4 can contribute its index times its frequency to the total: [ 0a_{0} + 1a_{1} + 2a_{2} + 3a_{3} + 4a_{4} = 5 ] 4. Notice that ( a_{4} leq 1 ) because there can't be more than one occurrence of any value to satisfy these sums. If ( a_{4}=1 ), this would lead to: [ 0a_{0} + 1a_{1} + 2a_{2} + 3a_{3} = 1 ] Alongside: [ a_{0} + a_{1} + a_{2} + a_{3} = 4 ] The only solution is: [ (a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}) = (3,1,0,0,1) ] This implies ( 0 ) occurs three times, contradicting our initial setup. 5. Therefore, ( a_{4} = 0 ). Substituting into the equation: [ 0a_{0} + 1a_{1} + 2a_{2} + 3a_{3} = 5 ] We get: [ a_{0} + a_{1} + a_{2} + a_{3} = 5 ] 6. Working on satisfying: [ 1a_{1} + 2a_{2} + 3a_{3} = 5 ] We find that: Let's assume potential solutions: [ a_{0}=2, a_{1}=1, a_{2}=2, a_{3}=0, a_{4}=0 ] Verifying this: [ a_{0}=2, a_{1}=1, a_{2}=2 text{ add to 5 and fit values } ] 7.

Since x = 0 (and therefore a = -1) does not give us the required two distinct real roots, let's investigate further for other values of a where the original equation: [ (a+1)(x^2 + 1)^2 - (2a + 3)(x^2 + 1)x + (a + 2)x^2 = 0 ] 3. To find conditions for exactly two distinct real roots, we will analyze the degree and form of the given polynomial. 4. Let's denote y = x^2 + 1, then the polynomial equation becomes: [ (a+1)y^2 - (2a + 3)yx + (a + 2)x^2 = 0 ] 5. This is a quadratic in y for fixed x. Denote it in standard form: [ Ay^2 + By + C = 0 text{ where: } ] [ A = a + 1 ] [ B = -(2a + 3)x ] [ C = (a + 2)x^2 ] 6. The discriminant Delta of this quadratic in y must be positive for y to correspond to real values: [ Delta = B^2 - 4AC ] [ Delta = [-(2a + 3)x]^2 - 4(a + 1)(a + 2)x^2 ] [ Delta = (2a + 3)^2x^2 - 4(a + 1)(a + 2)x^2 ] [ Delta = x^2 [(2a + 3)^2 - 4(a + 1)(a + 2)] ] 7. For Delta to be positive: [ (2a + 3)^2 - 4(a + 1)(a + 2) > 0 ] [ 4a^2 + 12a + 9 - 4(a^2 + 3a + 2) > 0 ] [ 4a^2 + 12a + 9 - 4a^2 - 12a - 8 > 0 ] [ 1 > 0 ] This inequality is always true for any real number a, indicating that the quadratic in y will always have real roots. Yet, since it simplifies trivially, let's refine focusing precisely on x and check roots multiplicity distinctly. 8. We consider boundary and critical values. For example, when a = 1 might show a broader roots base: 9.

(Isotomic lines of triangle (ABC) are defined as two lines, the intersection points of which are with the side lines (BC) of the triangle.)","completion":"The task at hand is to prove that two isogonal lines of triangle ( triangle ABC ) cannot intersect inside its medial triangle. To do this, we need to consider the properties of these isogonal lines and the configuration of the medial triangle. 1. **Define the problem context:** A triangle ( Delta ABC ) is given. Two isogonal lines are defined as lines such that each is the reflection of the other over the angle bisector of the same vertex. It is required to show that these isogonal lines do not intersect within the medial triangle of ( Delta ABC ). 2. **Identify the medial triangle:** Let the medial triangle be ( Delta DEF ), where ( D, E, ) and ( F ) are the midpoints of sides ( BC, CA, ) and ( AB ) respectively. The medial triangle ( Delta DEF ) will be similar to ( Delta ABC ) and one-fourth of the area of ( Delta ABC ). 3. **Use Menelaus' Theorem:** Suppose the isogonal lines are ( ell ) and ( ell' ). Consider ( ell ) intersecting ( AB ) at ( P ) and ( AC ) at ( Q ). The isogonal conjugate ( ell' ) will intersect ( AB ) at ( P' ) and ( AC ) at ( Q' ). According to Menelaus' Theorem applied to triangle ( Delta ALM ) with line ( ell ), we have: [ frac{LX}{XM} = frac{LQ}{QA} cdot frac{AP}{PM} ] Similarly, applying Menelaus' Theorem to triangle ( Delta ALM ) with line ( ell' ), we find: [ frac{LY}{YM} = frac{LQ'}{Q'A} cdot frac{AP'}{P'M} ] 4. **Analyze the ratios:** Since ( ell ) and ( ell' ) are isogonal lines: - ( frac{LQ}{QA} ) and ( frac{LQ'}{Q'A} ) are respective sections on sides ( AB ) and ( AC ) for ( ell ) and ( ell' ). - ( frac{AP}{PM} ) and ( frac{AP'}{P'M} ) are segments on the respective intersecting points. It is known that for isogonal lines, ( ell ) intersecting inside ( Delta DEF ) means: [ frac{LX}{XM} neq frac{LY}{YM} ] This important inequality indicates that the intersections are not collinear across the inner segment partitions. 5. **Conclusion:** The inequality ( frac{LX}{XM} < frac{LY}{YM} ) implies that the points created by the intersections of isogonal lines with the sides of the medial triangle will always form non-collinear segments. Thus, indicating that two isogonal lines cannot both intersect within the medial triangle while maintaining these ratios and properties. Hence, the assertion that two isogonal lines of a triangle cannot intersect inside its medial triangle is proved.

We can express ( a(n) ) in terms of ( n ) using the given relationship: [ a(n) = frac{2}{3} n ] Since ( a(n) ) must be an integer, this implies that ( frac{2}{3} n ) must also be an integer, indicating that ( n ) must be a multiple of 3. 3. Let's denote ( n ) as ( 3k ) where ( k ) is an integer: [ n = 3k ] Thus, the relation ( frac{a(n)}{n} = frac{2}{3} ) translates to: [ a(3k) = frac{2}{3} times 3k = 2k ] 4. ( a(n) = 2k ) must be the smallest integer such that ( (2k)! ) is divisible by ( 3k ). Now, analyze the divisibility condition. For ( 3k ) to divide ( (2k)! ): - If ( k > 3 ), then it would be very hard for ( 3k ) to divide ( (2k)! ). We need ( 3k ) factors in ( (2k)! ), but if ( k > 3 ), this becomes infeasible. Therefore, we must consider small values of ( k ). 5. Let's check some small values for ( k ): - If ( k = 1 ): [ n = 3 times 1 = 3 ] Here, ( a(3) = 2 ), and we need to check if ( (2k)! ) is divisible by ( 3k ). [ (2 times 1)! = 2! ] Clearly, 3 does not divide ( 2! ), so ( n = 3 ) does not satisfy the condition. - If ( k = 2 ): [ n = 3 times 2 = 6 ] Here, ( a(6) = frac{2}{3} times 6 = 4 ), and we need to check if ( 4! ) is divisible by 6. [ 4! = 24 ] Since 24 is divisible by 6, ( n = 6 ) satisfies the condition. - If ( k = 3 ): [ n = 3 times 3 = 9 ] Here, ( a(9) = frac{2}{3} times 9 = 6 ), and we need to check if ( 6! ) is divisible by 9.

So clearly, there was a mistake previously, and now since cos(theta) = frac{1}{3}, this means that the angle between vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is: theta = cos^{-1}left(frac{1}{3}right) Given that 0 leq theta leq pi and cos(frac{pi}{3}) = frac{1}{2}, which is not our case, and cos(frac{2pi}{3}) = -frac{1}{2} (and the cosine function is decreasing in the interval from 0 to pi), our angle theta must be greater than frac{pi}{3} but less than frac{2pi}{3}. Since none of the given options are exactly cos^{-1}left(frac{1}{3}right), we must check our work again. The dot product for perpendicular vectors is not yielding any acceptable solution, suggesting a mistake.

Part 2: Finding the Maximum Value of the Slope of Line OQ Given that the parabola is C: y^{2} = 4x with the focus F(1,0), let's consider the coordinates of point Q to be (m,n). The vector from Q to F is overrightarrow{QF} = (1 - m, -n). Given overrightarrow{PQ} = 9overrightarrow{QF}, we can express this as: overrightarrow{PQ} = (9 - 9m, -9n) This means the coordinates of point P are (10m - 9, 10n). Substituting point P into the equation of C, we get: (10n)^2 = 4(10m - 9) Simplifying this, we find: 100n^2 = 40m - 36 Rearranging for m, we get: m = frac{100n^2 + 36}{40} = frac{25n^2 + 9}{10} To find the maximum value of the slope K of the line OQ, we consider K = frac{n}{m}.

Correctly, the only meaningful inequalities are those that directly arise from the function's derivatives and ensuring that a satisfies the conditions for the function to be increasing across the entire domain. Given this clarification, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the provided solution. From our analysis, the correct condition for a to ensure the function is increasing everywhere on mathbb{R} is a < -2 (from the condition derived for x leq 1) and a < 0 (consistent with the condition for x > 1). However, the conclusion that the range of a is varnothing is not consistent with the step-by-step analysis. Given the oversight in the explanation, and focusing on the correct interpretation of the problem based on the function's derivatives and the conditions for being increasing, the range of a should be a < -2, considering only the conditions arising from the derivatives. The initial solution's conclusion about the range of a being varnothing does not align with the analysis; however, staying true to the guideline of not inventing new ideas but correctly interpreting the problem, the final answer should reflect the conditions under which the function is indeed increasing across its entire domain. Therefore, the correct range of a that makes the function increasing on mathbb{R}, based on the analysis provided, is a<0, and more specifically, considering both pieces, a < -2.

Cocyclic points do not form a unique configuration since they all lie on the same circle. 3. **Equidistant Circle Definition:** - Let ( mathcal{C} ) be a circle equidistant from ( A, B, C, D ). - Assume ( A, B, C) are on the same side of the circle. The center ( Omega ) of the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ) and radius ( R ) is noted.

It is essential to determine the directional path of the ball upon its release. 3. **Law of reflection**: According to the problem, the ball reflects off the sides of the polygon following the rule \\"angle of incidence equals angle of reflection.\\" This law will guide the ball's trajectory every time it hits a side. 4. **Reflection and trajectory analysis**: Consider the movement of the ball starting from vertex A at an acute angle to side AB. Since the ball bounces according to the angle of reflection, the smallest angle between side AB and the path segment remains unaltered during reflections across either parallel or perpendicular sides to AB. This can be visualized by considering that the reflection inverts the component of the velocity perpendicular to the reflecting side while preserving the component parallel to it. 5. **Path consistency**: Imagine extending two lines through point A forming angles relative to AB (either acute or obtuse). The ball, upon leaving A along one of these vectors inside the polygon, cannot return to A unless it reverses its trajectory exactly. 6. **Assume a contradiction**: Suppose it is possible for the ball to return to vertex A. Then, theoretically, one could backtrack its path using the same rules of reflection. The trajectory should correspond with the original path, only in reverse. This would only be possible if the initial direction of the ball and the opposite direction met at point A in the exact same manner as they sat out, canceling each other's deviations caused by reflections. 7. **Impossible direct return**: For the ball to reverse completely and arrive back at A, there would need to be a perpendicular collision at some midpoint of the trajectory causing a direction switch, which contradicts the described geometric properties and vertex angles since it involves non-existing perpendicular reflections (as those perpendicular reactions are invalid in the described setup). 8. **Contradiction resolution**: Since such perpendicular change does not exist under the given rules, the assumption that the ball can return to A leads to an impossibility.

To find the largest k such that the sum is (2013): Check the sum of the first 45 odd numbers: [ 1 + 3 + 5 + cdots + 89 = 45^2 = 2025 ] Since 2025 > 2013, k must be less than 45. 4. Check the sum of the first 44 odd numbers: [ 1 + 3 + 5 + cdots + 87 = 44^2 = 1936 ] 1936 < 2013, so k could be 44, but we need it to exactly sum up to 2013. 5. Construct the sum by finding which 43 numbers could sum up to 2013: First, calculate the sum of the first 43 odd numbers: [ 1 + 3 + 5 + cdots + 85 = 43^2 = 1849 ] 6. Calculate the difference needed to reach 2013: [ 2013 - 1849 = 164 ] 7. Adjust the sequence to make the sum exactly 2013: Substitute numbers in the sequence to increase the sum by 164. The difference can be achieved by replacing smaller odd numbers with larger odd numbers that are not already in the sum. For instance, replacing 83 with 99 will increase the sum by: [ 99 - 83 = 16 ] Similarly, replacing 81 with 97: [ 97 - 81 = 16 ] Let's calculate how many such steps are needed: [ frac{164}{16} = 10.25 ] So, we need approximately 10 replacements, but exact calculation requires careful selection of which numbers to replace. 8. If we consider replacing up to the exact needed amount, it confirms that k=43 is feasible with a special choice. # Conclusion: The largest possible value of k that allows the sum of these selected numbers to be exactly 2013 is [ boxed{43} ]"},{"prompt":"A bowling ball is a solid ball with a spherical surface and diameter 24 cm.

Will his mom and dad be able to catch Kolya if he runs three times faster than them (all three can see each other at all times)?","completion":"Let's proceed step by step to understand how Kolya can be caught in the park by his parents. 1. **Initial Setup**: Assume the park is represented by a square where each side has a length equal to AB = 1 unit. There are six alleys within this park: - Four alleys along the sides of the square. - Two alleys along the middle lines connecting the midpoints of opposite sides. 2. **Kolya's Speed**: Kolya runs at a speed that is three times faster than his parents. Let's denote the parents' speed as v. Thus, Kolya's speed is 3v. 3. **Initial Positioning**: Initially, the mother runs to point B and the father to point A as depicted in the figure. 4. **Control Region**: Define that a parent \\"controls\\" a point if their distance to that point is less than or equal to frac{1}{3} of the distance Kolya is from the point (since Kolya's speed is three times faster). 5. **Movement Strategy**: Suppose at any given moment, the father moves towards the mother while maintaining control over point A. Let’s parameterize the distance such that each point (e.g., A and B) is always kept under control by either the mother or father. 6. **Split Path Analysis**: - The mother stands at point B while the father starts moving towards point B, ensuring A remains under control. - Consider that the length AB =1. At any moment, if the father is at a position such that he is frac{1}{3} distance away (relative to Kolya’s position) from A, the sum of the distances from Kolya to both A and B is always less than or must equal 3. Here’s why: * If the father is controlling point A (distance frac{1}{3}), the mother can start moving along the alleys. * Because the total control lies over the point-to-point measurements within alleys and central lines, Kolya, with no unrestricted escape path, remains within visible limits. 7. **Complete Control**: Thus, as the father reaches closer to B, Kolya cannot move beyond the controlled perimeter at any adjacency point: - When the father just reaches B, both A and B control paths are jointly managed by both parents. - If Kolya has taken any of those in-between points, one parent would then swap, allowing the mother to move to A again, intersecting and looping via visible control parks. In conclusion, through this strategic distribution and continuous visible alignment, Kolya running three times faster can be caught using systematic control paths described. Therefore: # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Smogut (They can catch Kolya)}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let ABCD be a quadrilateral, and P,Q,R,S are the midpoints of AB, BC, CD, DA respectively.

This gives us u = ln z = bt + ln k, where u is the transformed variable. 1. **Calculating the Slope (b):** - The formula for the slope b of the regression line is given by: b = frac{sum_{i=1}^{7}(t_i-bar{t})(u_i-bar{u})}{sum_{i=1}^{7}(t_i-bar{t})^2} - Substituting the given values, we find: b = frac{25.2}{28} = 0.9 2. **Calculating ln k (Intercept):** - With b known, we can find ln k using the formula: ln k = bar{u} - bbar{t} - Given bar{u} and bar{t}, we calculate: ln k = -1.2 - 0.9 times 4 = -4.8 3. **Determining k:** - Since ln k = -4.8, we find k by exponentiating both sides: k = e^{-4.8} 4. **Formulating the Regression Equation:** - Substituting b and k back into the original equation, we get: z = ke^{bt} = e^{0.9t-4.8} 5. **Predicting the Cumulative Total Sinking Amount for t=8 Days:** - Substituting t=8 into the regression equation: z = e^{0.9 times 8 - 4.8} = e^{2.4} - Therefore, the predicted cumulative total sinking amount of the tunnel arch in the first 8 days is boxed{e^{2.4}} millimeters. # Part 2: Estimating the Latest Day for Adjusting Support Parameters 1. **Given the Sinking Rate Equation:** - From part (1), we have z = e^{0.9t-4.8}, and its derivative with respect to t gives the sinking rate: z' = 0.9e^{0.9t-4.8} 2. **Setting the Sinking Rate to Exceed 27 mm/day:** - We set the condition for when the sinking rate exceeds 27 mm/day: 0.9e^{0.9n-4.8} > 27 - Simplifying, we find: e^{0.9n-4.8} > 30 3. **Solving for n:** - Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: 0.9n - 4.8 > ln 30 - Given ln 30 approx 3.4, we solve for n: 0.9n > 3.4 + 4.8 - Therefore: n > frac{3.4 + 4.8}{0.9} approx 9.1 4. **Conclusion:** - Since n > 9.1, the latest day when the support parameters need to be adjusted to avoid collapse is on the 9th day, as adjustments need to be made one day in advance. - Thus, the support parameters need to be adjusted by the boxed{9th} day at the latest."},{"prompt":"Let triangle{XYZ} be a right triangle with XY = 100, XZ = 140, and YZ = 180.

To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the statements made by each of the 100 people sitting in a circle. 2. Let's consider the scenario where each person says, \\"The next k people sitting after me in clockwise order are liars.\\" 3. We need to determine the value of k such that this claim is logically consistent given that there are knights (who always tell the truth) and liars (who always lie). 4. Begin by defining two key properties: - Each knight tells the truth, so the k people after a knight must indeed all be liars. - Each liar lies, so the k people after a liar cannot all be liars; there must be at least one knight among those k people. 5. Let us assume there is a knight. The knight's statement is true, hence the next k people after this knight must all be liars. 6. Now consider any liar sitting in the circle. According to their statement, the next k people after them should also be liars, but since they are lying, at least one of those k people must be a knight. 7. We can use a periodic structure to capture this arrangement. Specifically, consider how knights and liars are placed around the circle. If there is a consistent repetition of such a pattern, it suggests a periodic structure of length k+1, where one person (a knight) is followed by k liars in a cycle. 8. Consequently, the number of people (100) must be divisible by k+1, meaning 100 = m(k+1) for some integer m. 9.

This means there are also 2 outcomes from this semi-final. 2. **Sunday's Final and Third Place Matches**: We have two teams, each from one semi-final match. For the two teams that play on Sunday, there are 2 possible ways of ranking them for first and second places. Similarly, the two teams that did not advance past their semi-finals on Saturday have 2 possible ways of ranking for third and fourth places. 3. **Calculating Total Rankings**: Since each pair of winners and losers from the semi-finals can be arranged in two ways, you have 2 times 2 = 4 possibilities for first-second and another 2 times 2 = 4 for third-fourth rankings. There are two advancing scenarios from two separate semi-finals, adding up to 4 times 4 = 16 four-team ranking sequences for the entire tournament.

Then, the polynomial can be factored as: [ (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = x^3 - (a+b+c)x^2 + (ab+bc+ca)x - abc ] 2. **Compare coefficients**: By comparing the coefficients of the polynomial (x^3 - nx + mn = 0) with the factored form, we get: [ a + b + c = 0 ] [ ab + bc + ca = -n ] [ -abc = mn ] 3. **Express (n) and (m) in terms of (a), (b), and (c)**: From the above equations, we can express (n) and (m) as: [ n = -(ab + bc + ca) ] [ mn = abc ] 4. **Choose specific values for (a), (b), and (c)**: To ensure that (m) and (n) are relatively prime, we can choose specific values for (a), (b), and (c) such that (a + b + c = 0) and (ab + bc + ca) is a cube. One such choice is: [ a = x, quad b = y, quad c = -(x + y) ] where (x) and (y) are coprime integers. 5. **Calculate (n) and (m)**: Substituting (a = x), (b = y), and (c = -(x + y)) into the expressions for (n) and (m), we get: [ n = -(xy + y(-x-y) + (-x-y)x) = -(xy - xy - y^2 - x^2 - xy) = (x^2 + xy + y^2) ] [ mn = x cdot y cdot (-(x + y)) = -x^2y - xy^2 ] Since (n = (x^2 + xy + y^2)), we can write: [ n = (x^2 + xy + y^2)^3 ] and [ m = frac{-x^2y - xy^2}{(x^2 + xy + y^2)^3} ] 6. **Verify that (m) and (n) are relatively prime**: Since (x) and (y) are coprime, (x^2 + xy + y^2) is also coprime with (x) and (y). Therefore, (m) and (n) are relatively prime. 7. **Conclusion**: We have shown that for any coprime integers (x) and (y), the pairs ((m, n)) given by: [ n = (x^2 + xy + y^2)^3 ] [ m = (x + y)xy ] are relatively prime and satisfy the given polynomial equation with three distinct integer roots.

We define ( x = overline{ab} ) and ( y = overline{cd} ). The number ( n ) is said to be *guanaco* if the product ( xy ) is a positive divisor of ( n ). 2. We express ( n ) in terms of ( x ) and ( y ): [ n = 100x + y ] The condition for ( n ) to be guanaco is: [ xy mid 100x + y ] 3.

Since ( y ) must be a two-digit number, ( frac{100x}{kx - 1} ) must be an integer. This implies that ( kx - 1 ) must be a divisor of ( 100x ). 5. We need to find values of ( k ) such that ( y ) remains a two-digit number. We start by considering the possible values of ( k ) that divide 100: [ k in {1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100} ] 6.

After picking the additional apples, they each found out they still needed to pick 600 more apples to reach the target of 2600 apples. So, the total number of apples Kaiden would have after picking the additional 600 would be: K + (3/4)K + 600 = 2600 Similarly, for Adriel: A + (3/4)A + 600 = 2600 We can simplify both equations by combining like terms: (1 + 3/4)K + 600 = 2600 (7/4)K + 600 = 2600 (1 + 3/4)A + 600 = 2600 (7/4)A + 600 = 2600 Now, we can solve for K and A by subtracting 600 from both sides of each equation: (7/4)K = 2600 - 600 (7/4)K = 2000 (7/4)A = 2600 - 600 (7/4)A = 2000 Now, we divide both sides by (7/4) to find K and A: K = 2000 / (7/4) K = 2000 * (4/7) K = 8000 / 7 K = 1142.8571...

How many sets of Three Top Numbers are there?","completion":"Let's denote the three consecutive two-digit numbers as n, n+1, n+2, where n is a two-digit number. According to the conditions, we have: 1. The sum should be a two-digit number. Considering three consecutive numbers, the smallest sum we get when n = 10 is 10 + 11 + 12 = 33, which is a two-digit number. The largest sum we get when n = 99 would be 99 + 100 + 101 = 300, which is not a two-digit number. Therefore, n cannot be 99, and n must be less than 98 (as 98 + 99 + 100 is still a two-digit number, 297). 2. The units digit of their sum is greater than the units digit of each of the three numbers. Let's analyze the units digits. The units digit of n could be any number from 0 to 9. The sequence of units digits for n, n+1, n+2 will be a sequence of three consecutive digits. The units digit of the sum is: (n mod 10) + ((n+1) mod 10) + ((n+2) mod 10) = 3n + 3 mod 10. We will ignore possible carryovers from the tens place as they do not affect the units digit of the sum. The resulting units digit after summing the three numbers is 3n + 3 mod 10, which must be unique since the carryover doesn't influence the units digit criteria. Now, since we want the units digit of the sum to be greater than the units digit of each of the original three numbers, we must have the following (assuming 'u' to be the units digit of n): u < u+1 < u+2 < (3u + 3) mod 10. We must find all possible values of 'u' such that the above inequality holds. Since the problem statement demands 'u' to be a digit, 'u' can range from 0 to 9. By testing each value, we find: - For u=0, nothing to compare with since the first number is not a two-digit number. - For u=1, (3(1) + 3) mod 10 = 6, and indeed we have 1 < 2 < 3 < 6. - For u=2, (3(2) + 3) mod 10 = 9, and we have 2 < 3 < 4 < 9. - ... - For u=6, (3(6) + 3) mod 10 = 1, 6 is not less than 1. - ... - For u=9, (3(9) + 3) mod 10 = 0, 9 is not less than 0. In summary, we need to find all the cases when the inequality holds and ensure that we only consider those cases where n is a two-digit number.

If the dress cost 68 after the second sale of 20% off, that means the price before the second sale was 68 / (1 - 0.20) = 68 / 0.80 = 85. Now, let's find the original price before any sales. If 85 is the price after a 15% reduction, then the original price was 85 / (1 - 0.15) = 85 / 0.85 = 100. Next, we need to calculate the final price after the two price increases. The first increase is by 25%, so the new price after this increase is 68 * (1 + 0.25) = 68 * 1.25 = 85. The second increase is by 10%, so the final price after this increase is 85 * (1 + 0.10) = 85 * 1.10 = 93.50. Now, we can find the difference between the original price and the final price. The original price was 100, and the final price is 93.50, so the difference is 100 - 93.50 = 6.50.

Therefore, there are 71 possible sums (from 3 to 73). 3. **Pigeonhole Principle:** Since we have 45 pairs and only 71 possible sums, it might seem that there is no immediate contradiction. However, we need to consider the differences between the numbers. 4. **Counting Differences:** The smallest non-negative difference between any two numbers in ( {1, 2, 3, ldots, 37} ) is ( 0 ) (if the numbers are the same), and the largest difference is ( 36 ). Thus, there are 37 possible differences. 5. **Applying Pigeonhole Principle to Differences:** Since there are 45 pairs and only 37 possible differences, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least 9 pairs of numbers that have the same difference. This means there are 9 coincidences of the form ( a - b = c - d ) with ( a, b, c, d in S ). 6. **Analyzing Coincidences:** If all four numbers in such a coincidence are different, then we have ( a - b = c - d ). Adding ( b ) and ( d ) to both sides, we get: [ a + d = b + c ] This is exactly what we need to prove: that there exist four distinct numbers such that the sum of two of them equals the sum of the other two. 7. **Special Case Analysis:** Suppose all coincidences are of the form ( a - b = c - a ) for some ( a, b, c in S ). Let ( M ) be the maximum and ( m ) be the minimum numbers from ( S ). Notice that ( c - M ) and ( m - b ) cannot yield positive differences when ( c, b in S ). Hence, numbers ( a ) in ( a - b = c - d ) must be all from the remaining 8 elements of ( S ). 8. **Finding Repeated ( a ):** Since there are 9 coincidences and only 8 possible ( a )'s, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one ( a ) that appears in two different coincidences. Suppose we have: [ a - b_1 = c_1 - a quad text{and} quad a - b_2 = c_2 - a ] Subtracting these two equalities, we get: [ b_2 + c_2 = c_1 + b_1 ] It is easy to notice that ( b_1, b_2, c_1, c_2 ) must all be different.

How many whiskers does each cat have?","completion":"Let's start by calculating the number of whiskers Catman Do has. Since Catman Do has 6 less than twice the number of whiskers as Princess Puff, we first find twice the number of whiskers Princess Puff has and then subtract 6. Princess Puff has 14 whiskers, so twice that number is: 2 * 14 = 28 whiskers Now, subtract 6 to find the number of whiskers Catman Do has: 28 - 6 = 22 whiskers Catman Do has 22 whiskers. Next, let's calculate the number of whiskers Sir Whiskerson has. Sir Whiskerson has 8 more whiskers than the combined total of whiskers on Princess Puff and Catman Do. First, we find the combined total of whiskers on Princess Puff and Catman Do: 14 (Princess Puff) + 22 (Catman Do) = 36 whiskers Now, add 8 to find the number of whiskers Sir Whiskerson has: 36 + 8 = 44 whiskers Sir Whiskerson has 44 whiskers.

If F_1 and F_2 are considered as the foci of a potential ellipse, and the sum of the distances from a point M to each focus is equal to the constant 8, then under normal circumstances, M would trace the outer rim of an ellipse. However, it is also given that the distance between the two foci |F_1F_2| = 8. For an ellipse, the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci (which is |MF_1| + |MF_2| for point M) is greater than the distance between the foci. Therefore, in this specific case, the only points M that satisfy the condition |MF_1| + |MF_2| = 8 exactly equal the distance between the two foci, meaning that M can only be exactly at F_1 or F_2. This scenario represents a degenerate case of an ellipse, which is essentially a line segment with zero length, because the locus of point M does not form an extended curve but rather consists only of the points F_1 and F_2.

In one operation, we can choose two intersecting segments [AB] and [CD]. We then uncross them by replacing them with [AC] and [BD]. Prove that only a finite number of such operations can be performed.","completion":"1. **Observation**: Given segments ([AB]) and ([CD]) in the plane such that no three endpoints are collinear, we perform an operation by replacing the intersecting segments ([AB]) and ([CD]) with ([AC]) and ([BD]). 2. **Invariant Property**: Notice that every time we replace the intersecting segments ([AB]) and ([CD]) with ([AC]) and ([BD]), the sum of the lengths of the new segments ([AC]) and ([BD]) is strictly less than the sum of the lengths of the original segments ([AB]) and ([CD]). This is due to the triangle inequality. - **Triangle Inequality**: In a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the remaining side. Therefore, for any points (A), (B), (C), and (D) such that ([AB]) intersects ([CD]), the following holds: [ AB + CD > AC + BD ] 3. **Decrease in Sum of Segment Lengths**: When we go from ([AB]) and ([CD]) to ([AC]) and ([BD]), the inequality implies: [ AB + CD > AC + BD ] This means the total sum of the lengths of all segments strictly decreases with each operation. We denote this sum by (S). 4. **Finiteness Argument**: Since the sum (S) of the lengths of the segments is strictly positive and strictly decreases with each operation, it must reach a minimum value after a finite number of operations. There is no infinite strictly decreasing sequence of positive real numbers. 5. **Conclusion**: The strictly decreasing nature of the sum of segment lengths ensures that the process of performing these operations will terminate after a finite number of steps.

The even numbers from 0 to 60 are: 0, 2, 4, 6, ldots, 58, 60 However, for the term to be rational, r should not only be even but also a multiple of 4 (since it is a power of 2). Hence, we look at every fourth term in the sequence: 0, 4, 8, ldots, 56, 60 There are a total of frac{60}{4} + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16 terms in this list.

How much money does Kekai have left after giving his parents their share?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total money Kekai made from selling each type of item, taking into account the discounts. For the shirts: Each shirt sells for 1 with a 20% discount. The discount on each shirt is 20/100 * 1 = 0.20. So, each shirt sells for 1 - 0.20 = 0.80. Since he sold 5 shirts, he made 5 * 0.80 = 4 from shirts. For the pants: Each pair of pants sells for 3 with a 10% discount. The discount on each pair of pants is 10/100 * 3 = 0.30. So, each pair of pants sells for 3 - 0.30 = 2.70. Since he sold 5 pairs of pants, he made 5 * 2.70 = 13.50 from pants. For the hats: Each hat sells for 2 without any discount. Since he sold 3 hats, he made 3 * 2 = 6 from hats. For the shoes: Each pair of shoes sells for 10 with a 15% discount. The discount on each pair of shoes is 15/100 * 10 = 1.50. So, each pair of shoes sells for 10 - 1.50 = 8.50. Since he sold 2 pairs of shoes, he made 2 * 8.50 = 17 from shoes. Now, let's add up the total money Kekai made from all items: Total money = Money from shirts + Money from pants + Money from hats + Money from shoes Total money = 4 + 13.50 + 6 + 17 Total money = 40.50 Kekai's parents ask him to contribute 35% of the total money to the family fund.

Evaluate Q(x) for negative x: - x^6: Positive as the power is even. - -4x^5: Positive as negative times a negative raised to an odd power. - 3x^4: Positive, an even power of a negative results in a positive. - -7x^3: Positive, similar reasoning as -4x^5. - -x^2: Positive since square of a negative is positive. - x: Negative due to negative sign. - 10: Positive as it's a constant. Therefore, Q(x) is positive for large negative x and becomes negative when close to zero due to x term.

According to the given information, 15% of the population died due to bombardment. Therefore, the remaining population after the bombardment is 85% of the original population (100% - 15% = 85%). We can express this as: Remaining population after bombardment = 0.85 * P Next, 25% of the remaining population left the village due to fear. This means that 75% of the population that remained after the bombardment stayed in the village (100% - 25% = 75%). We can express this as: Final population = 0.75 * Remaining population after bombardment We are given that the final population is 4555. So we can set up the equation: 4555 = 0.75 * (0.85 * P) Now, we can solve for P: 4555 = 0.75 * 0.85 * P 4555 = 0.6375 * P Divide both sides by 0.6375 to find P: P = 4555 / 0.6375 P ≈ 7142.86 Since the population must be a whole number, we can round to the nearest whole number if necessary.

The smallest possible sum of any four elements in ( P ) is: [ (n - 1) + n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = 4n + 1 ] Therefore, for any four elements chosen from this subset ( P ), their sum will always be greater than or equal to ( 4n + 1 ).

The sum of four elements, including triple pairs without common elements, ensure the sum: [ 2n + 1 + 2n = 4n + 1 ] 5. **Conclusion**: Since we need to ensure that any subset of size ( k ) always includes four elements whose sum is ( 4n + 1 ), ( k = n + 3 ) is optimal.

Substituting (4,0) gives 16 + 0 + 4D + 0 + F = 0, which simplifies to 16 + 4D + F = 0. 3. Substituting (-1,1) gives 1 + 1 - D + E + F = 0, which simplifies to 2 - D + E + F = 0. From the first equation, we have F = 0. Substituting F = 0 into the other equations, we get: 1.

Solution: Let f(a) = a(2b - 3) - b, Since for any real number a leq -1, a cdot 2b - b - 3a geq 0 always holds, then 2b - 3 < 0, and f(-1) geq 0 always holds, which implies b < log_2 3, and 3 - b - 2b geq 0, from b + 2b leq 3, and since g(x) = x + 2x is increasing on mathbb{R}, and g(1) = 3, we have g(b) leq g(1), solving this gives b leq 1. Since b < log_2 3, we have b leq 1. Therefore, the answer is: boxed{(-infty, 1]}.

Thus, [ f circ g in text{Iso}(E). ] 3. **Associativity of Composition:** - Function composition ( circ ) is associative by nature. For any (f, g, h in text{Iso}(E)), [ (f circ (g circ h))(x) = f((g circ h)(x)) = f(g(h(x))), ] and [ ((f circ g) circ h)(x) = (f circ g)(h(x)) = f(g(h(x))). ] - Since both expressions are equal for all (x), we have [ f circ (g circ h) = (f circ g) circ h. ] 4. **Existence of Identity Element:** - The identity map (mathbf{Id}_E) defined by (mathbf{Id}_E(x) = x) for all (x in E), is an isometry. - For any (f in text{Iso}(E)), we have: [ f circ mathbf{Id}_E = f quad text{and} quad mathbf{Id}_E circ f = f. ] - Thus, (mathbf{Id}_E) serves as the identity element in (left(text{Iso}(E), circright)). 5. **Existence of Inverses:** - Take any (f in text{Iso}(E)). - Since (f) is an isometry, it is bijective. Its inverse (f^{-1}: E to E) exists. - We need to show that (f^{-1}) is also an isometry. - For any (x, y in E), [ d(f^{-1}(x), f^{-1}(y)) = d(f(f^{-1}(x)), f(f^{-1}(y))) = d(x, y). ] - Therefore, (f^{-1} in text{Iso}(E)). - Since (f circ f^{-1} = mathbf{Id}_E) and (f^{-1} circ f = mathbf{Id}_E), every element in (text{Iso}(E)) has an inverse in (text{Iso}(E)). # Conclusion: Since (left(text{Iso}(E), circright)) satisfies closure, associativity, identity element, and the existence of inverses, it forms a group.

First, note that the sum of the terms in (1 + x^n + x^{2n} + cdots + x^{mn}) can be expressed as a geometric series: [ 1 + x^n + x^{2n} + cdots + x^{mn} = frac{x^{(m+1)n} - 1}{x^n - 1} ] 2.

Given the graph's behavior, p(x) must be linear to ensure the horizontal asymptote at y=0. 2. **Determining the Factors of p(x) and q(x):** - The presence of a hole at x=0 suggests that both p(x) and q(x) have a factor of x. This is because a hole in the graph of a rational function indicates a common factor in the numerator and denominator that gets canceled out. - Additionally, the vertical asymptote at x=1 means that q(x), the denominator, must have a factor of (x-1). This is because vertical asymptotes occur at values of x that make the denominator zero but not the numerator. 3. **Formulating p(x) and q(x):** - Based on the above observations, we can express p(x) = ax and q(x) = bx(x-1), where a and b are constants to be determined. 4. **Finding the Constants a and b:** - Given that p(3) = 3, we substitute x=3 into p(x) = ax to get 3a = 3. Solving this equation yields a = 1. - Given that q(2) = 2, we substitute x=2 into q(x) = bx(x-1) to get 2b(2-1) = 2. Solving this equation yields b = 1. 5. **Constructing p(x) and q(x) with Found Constants:** - With a=1 and b=1, we have p(x) = x and q(x) = x(x - 1) = x^2 - x. 6. **Calculating p(x) + q(x):** - Adding p(x) and q(x) together, we get p(x) + q(x) = x + (x^2 - x) = x^2.

(Answer with a number)","completion":"To solve this problem, we first consider the distribution of positions for A and B. There are 4 pavilions, so A has 4 choices for his position. After A chooses his position, B has 3 remaining choices for his position. Therefore, the number of ways for A and B to independently take on a position is 4 times 3 = 12. Next, we need to distribute the remaining 3 volunteers among the 4 pavilions. Since each pavilion must be staffed by at least one volunteer, and A and B have already taken 2 of the positions, there are 2 cases to consider for the remaining 3 volunteers: 1. **All three volunteers go to the same pavilion**: There are 2 pavilions left without any volunteers (since A and B are each at a pavilion), so we choose 1 out of these 2 pavilions for all 3 volunteers. This can be done in C_2^1 = 2 ways. 2. **The three volunteers are distributed across the 2 remaining pavilions**: Each of the 3 volunteers can choose between the 2 pavilions, so there are 2^3 = 8 ways to distribute them. However, this count includes the scenarios where all 3 volunteers end up in the same pavilion, which we have already counted in the first case. Since there are 2 such scenarios (all in one pavilion or the other), we subtract these to get 8 - 2 = 6 valid distributions. Adding the two cases together, we have 2 + 6 = 8 ways to distribute the remaining 3 volunteers among the 4 pavilions, considering the constraints. Therefore, the total number of ways for A and B to each independently take on a position, and for the remaining 3 volunteers to be distributed among the 4 pavilions, is 12 times 8 = 96. However, we must exclude the scenarios where any pavilion is left without a volunteer. Since there are 4 pavilions and each must have at least one volunteer, the only incorrect scenario is when all 5 volunteers are distributed across 3 pavilions, leaving one pavilion empty.

Let F be the first number in a sequence generated by the rule above. F is a sweet number if 16 is not a term in the sequence that starts with F. How many of the whole numbers 1 through 50 are sweet numbers?","completion":"To determine how many of the whole numbers 1 through 50 are \\"sweet numbers\\" based on Zan's iterative rule, we need to analyze the behavior of numbers under the rule modulo 12. This is because the rule involves doubling numbers (if 25 or less) or subtracting 12 (if greater than 25), and we are interested in when a sequence can include the number 16. 1. **Doubling a number modulo 12**: If a number is 25 or less, doubling it affects its remainder when divided by 12. However, if a number is greater than 25, subtracting 12 from it does not change its remainder modulo 12. 2. **Identifying critical remainders**: We are particularly interested in the remainder 4 modulo 12, since 16 equiv 4 pmod{12}. A sequence will include the number 16 if and only if it includes a number that is congruent to 4 modulo 12. 3. **Analyzing remainders**: - **Remainders that lead to 4**: Doubling 1, 2, 4, and 8 modulo 12 eventually yields a remainder of 4. This means sequences starting with numbers having these remainders can include 16. - **Remainders that do not lead to 4**: Doubling 3, 6, 9, and 0 modulo 12 always yields a remainder that does not lead to 4. Specifically, these sequences will not include a number that is congruent to 4 modulo 12, making them \\"sweet numbers\\". - **Special cases (5, 7, 10, and 11)**: - Doubling 11 modulo 12 gives 10, and further doubling can lead to 4. Thus, 11 is not a \\"sweet number\\" starting point. - Doubling 10 modulo 12 can eventually lead to 4, so 10 is not a \\"sweet number\\" starting point. - Doubling 5 gives 10 modulo 12, which can lead to 4, so 5 is not a \\"sweet number\\" starting point. - Doubling 7 gives 2 modulo 12, which can lead to 4, so 7 is not a \\"sweet number\\" starting point. 4. **Conclusion**: The \\"sweet numbers\\" are those whose remainders modulo 12 are 0, 3, 6, or 9, which are the multiples of 3. To find how many such numbers are between 1 and 50, we count the multiples of 3 in this range. 5. **Counting multiples of 3 between 1 and 50**: The first multiple of 3 is 3, and the last is 48. To find the total number of multiples of 3, we use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: frac{text{Last term} - text{First term}}{text{Common difference}} + 1 = frac{48 - 3}{3} + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16.

Then (because they are tangent, the line connecting M and F must be perpendicular to the x-axis), M is on the ellipse, so y= frac {b^{2}}{a} or y=- frac {b^{2}}{a} (since a^2=b^2+c^2). Thus, the radius of the circle is frac {b^{2}}{a}. Draw a line MN perpendicular to the y-axis passing through M, intersecting it at N. Then PN = NQ, and MN = c (since PN and NQ are both radii, △PQM is isosceles). So, PN = NQ = sqrt {( frac {b^{2}}{a})^{2}-c^{2}}. Since ∠PMQ is obtuse, ∠PMN = ∠QMN > 45°. This implies PN = NQ > MN = c. Hence, sqrt {( frac {b^{2}}{a})^{2}-c^{2}} > c, which gives us frac {b^{4}}{a^{2}}-c^{2} > c^{2}. This simplifies to frac {(a^{2}-c^{2}) ^{2}}{2c^{2}} > 2c^{2}. Rearranging, we get a^2 - 2c^2 + c^2e^2 > 2c^2, which gives us frac {1}{e^{2}} - 4 + e^{2} > 0. This simplifies to e^{4} - 4e^{2} + 1 > 0. Factoring, we get (e^{2} - 2)^{2} - 3 > 0, which gives us e^{2} - 2 < -sqrt {3}. Since 0 < e < 1, we get e^{2} < -sqrt {3} + 2.

We will use polynomial theory and properties of finite fields to achieve this. 1. **Polynomial Representation**: Consider the configuration of lamps as a polynomial ( g_a(x) ) in ( mathbb{F}_2[x] ) modulo ( x^n - 1 ). Each lamp configuration can be represented as a polynomial where the coefficient of ( x^i ) is 1 if the ( i )-th lamp is on and 0 if it is off. 2. **Function Definition**: The function ( f ) can be expressed in terms of polynomials as: [ f(g_a) = frac{x g_a(x^2) - g_a(x)}{x-1} pmod{x^n - 1} ] This function describes the transformation of the lamp configuration after performing the cool procedure. 3. **Bijectivity Condition**: For ( f ) to be bijective, it must be injective.

This function is a permutation on the set ( {0, 1, ldots, n-1} ) with at least two cycles when ( m > 1 ). This is because ( h(m cdot 2^k - 1) = m cdot 2^k - 1 ), forming a cycle of length 1. - **Cycle Construction**: For a cycle of length ( j ) containing elements ( c_1, c_2, ldots, c_j ), construct the polynomial: [ g_a(x) = sum_{i=1}^j x^{c_i} ] This polynomial satisfies ( x^n - 1 mid x g_a(x^2) - g_a(x) ). Since there are at least two cycles, either one of them is 0, or the sum of them will be 0. Thus, there exists a non-zero polynomial ( g ) such that ( f(g) = 0 ). 6. **Case ( m = 1 )**: - When ( n = 2^k ), we need to show that ( f ) is bijective.

An isosceles triangle has at least two sides of equal length. Therefore, no two sides of any triangle face can be equal. 2. **Minimum Number of Edges**: Consider a tetrahedron with four faces: ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ). A tetrahedron has (6) edges in total. 3. **Non-Isosceles Faces**: To ensure no face is an isosceles triangle, each face must have three sides of different lengths.

Let's consider that each triangular face must have sides: [ a, b, c d, e, f g, h, i j, k, l ] It's evident that having all faces with three different lengths implies intersections where edges shared between faces must also be unique to their respective triangular faces. 5. **Count of Unique Edges**: Since no length is shared between adjacent edges of any face, this implies: [ a neq b neq c d neq e neq f g neq h neq i j neq k neq l ] Here, no two adjacent edges (those making up any face) can be the same. 6. **Minimum Inequal Edge Configuration**: To minimize the number of edges that are unequal: - Consider that each face (A) shares edges with (B, C, D) respectively. - For simplification and based on edge sharing, at least three edges must be unequal to satisfy the non-isosceles condition for at least one face.

Now we can calculate the sine and cosine of angle alpha: sin alpha = frac{y}{r} = frac{-1}{sqrt{5}}, cos alpha = frac{x}{r} = frac{2}{sqrt{5}}.

Differentiate f(x) with respect to x to get: f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(ax^2) + frac{d}{dx}(ln x) f'(x) = 2ax + frac{1}{x} A vertical tangent line has an undefined slope, which corresponds to the derivative being undefined or infinite. The only possibility in this case for f'(x) to be infinite is when its denominator equals zero. However, since the derivative f'(x) has no denominator other than 1 (after simplification), it can never be undefined due to division by zero. Therefore, we are looking for points where the slope of the tangent line is extremely high, which occurs as x approaches zero from the right (since the domain of f must exclude x leq 0 where ln x is undefined). As x rightarrow 0^+, the frac{1}{x} term will dominate the behavior of f'(x) because it increases without bound, while 2ax will approach 0. For the slope to approach infinity, 2ax must not interfere significantly, particularly 2ax should have a limit of -infty as x approaches 0 so that it can cancel out the positive infinity from frac{1}{x}.

Substitute this expansion back into the integral: [ int_{0}^{1} frac{1 - (1 - t)^n}{t} , dt = int_{0}^{1} frac{sum_{k=1}^{n} binom{n}{k} (-1)^k t^k}{t} , dt = int_{0}^{1} sum_{k=1}^{n} binom{n}{k} (-1)^k t^{k-1} , dt ] 6. Evaluate the integral term-by-term: [ int_{0}^{1} t^{k-1} , dt = left[ frac{t^k}{k} right]_{0}^{1} = frac{1}{k} ] Therefore: [ int_{0}^{1} sum_{k=1}^{n} binom{n}{k} (-1)^k t^{k-1} , dt = sum_{k=1}^{n} binom{n}{k} (-1)^k frac{1}{k} ] 7. This results in the left-hand side of the given identity: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} binom{n}{k} (-1)^k frac{1}{k} = binom{n}{1} frac{1}{1} - binom{n}{2} frac{1}{2} + cdots + (-1)^{n-1} binom{n}{n} frac{1}{n} ] 8.

First, we convert their speeds from km/hr to m/min, since the circumference of the track is given in meters and we are interested in finding the time in minutes. Deepak's speed: 4.5 km/hr = 4500 m/hr = 4500 m / 60 min = 75 m/min His wife's speed: 3.75 km/hr = 3750 m/hr = 3750 m / 60 min = 62.5 m/min Now, we add their speeds together to find the combined speed at which they are moving towards each other.

Clearly, ((a_1)) is a permutation of ((x+1)). - **Inductive Step:** Assume that for some ( k geq 1 ), ((a_1, a_2, cdots, a_k)) is a permutation of ((x+1, x+2, cdots, x+k)) for some integer ( x ). We need to show that ((a_1, a_2, cdots, a_k, a_{k+1})) is a permutation of ((x+1, x+2, cdots, x+(k+1))). 3. Since ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_k, a_{k+1} ) must have distinct residues modulo ( k+1 ), ( a_{k+1} neq a_i ) for any ( 1 leq i leq k ). Thus, we either have ( a_{k+1} > x+k ) or ( a_{k+1} < x+1 ). 4. **Case 1:** ( a_{k+1} > x+k ) - If ( a_{k+1} = x+k+1 ), then ((a_1, a_2, cdots, a_{k+1})) is a permutation of ((x+1, x+2, cdots, x+(k+1))). - Else, ( a_{k+1} = x+r ) for some ( r geq k+2 ). Then, [ a_{k+1} equiv x + r equiv x+1 equiv a_j pmod{r-1}, ] for some ( 1 leq j leq k ). Since ( r geq k+2 ), ( r-1 geq k+1 ), which contradicts the fact that ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_{r-1} ) produce distinct remainders modulo ( r-1 ). 5. **Case 2:** ( a_{k+1} < x+1 ) - If ( a_{k+1} = x ), then ((a_1, a_2, cdots, a_{k+1})) is a permutation of ((x, x+1, cdots, x+k) = ((x-1) + 1, (x-1) + 2, cdots, (x-1) + (k+1))). - Else, ( a_{k+1} = x - r ) for some ( r geq 1 ). Then, [ a_{k+1} equiv x - r equiv x + k equiv a_j pmod{k+r}, ] for some ( 1 leq j leq k ). Since ( r geq 1 ), ( k+r geq k+1 ), which contradicts the fact that ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_{k+r} ) produce distinct remainders modulo ( k+r ). 6. Thus, our inductive step is complete, and the claim is true. 7. Now, let ( M ) be an integer. Clearly, ( M ) cannot appear more than once in ({a_n}_{n geq 1}), since if ( a_i = a_j = M ), then ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_j ) cannot have distinct remainders modulo ( j ) since ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) would produce the same remainder modulo ( j ). 8. Thus, it suffices to show that ( M ) must appear in ({a_n}_{n geq 1}) at least once. Assume the contrary. Let ( a_1 = t ). 9. We cannot have ( t = M ), since ( M ) does not appear in ({a_n}_{n geq 1}), and ( t = a_1 ). 10. **Case 1:** ( t < M ) - I claim that ( a_k < M ) for any ( k geq 1 ). To show this, assume the contrary. Then, there exists a ( j geq 1 ) with ( a_j geq M ), so ( a_j > M ) (as ( M ) does not appear in ({a_n}_{n geq 1})). Then, ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_j ) are just ( j ) consecutive integers by our claim. However, since ( t < M < a_j ), we must have ( M ) appearing in ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_j ), since ( t ) and ( a_j ) appear in it, so every integer in between appears in it. Thus, ( a_k < M ) for ( k geq 1 ). However, this is absurd, since ({a_n}_{n geq 1}) has infinitely many positive terms, and no two terms are equal as discussed above, so ({a_n}_{n geq 1}) must be unbounded above (since if ( a_n leq B ) for some ( B geq 1 ) for all ( n geq 1 ), then there are at most ( B ) positive terms, since each of ( 1, 2, cdots, B ) can be achieved at most once by ({a_n}_{n geq 1})). 11. **Case 2:** ( t > M ) - I claim that ( a_k > M ) for any ( k geq 1 ). To show this, assume the contrary. Then, there exists a ( j geq 1 ) with ( a_j leq M ), so ( a_j < M ) (as ( M ) does not appear in ({a_n}_{n geq 1})). Then, ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_j ) are just ( j ) consecutive integers by our claim. However, since ( a_j < M < t ), we must have ( M ) appearing in ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_j ), since ( a_j ) and ( t ) appear in it, so every integer in between appears in it. Thus, ( a_k > M ) for ( k geq 1 ). However, this is absurd, since ({a_n}_{n geq 1}) has infinitely many negative terms, and no two terms are equal as discussed above, so ({a_n}_{n geq 1}) must be unbounded below (since if ( a_n geq -B ) for some ( B geq 1 ) for all ( n geq 1 ), then there are at most ( B ) negative terms, since each of ( -1, -2, cdots, -B ) can be achieved by at most once by ({a_n}_{n geq 1})). 12.

Consider the equation ( 11p = q^3 - r^3 ), where ( p, q, ) and ( r ) are prime numbers. 2. Analyze the parity (odd/even nature) of the expressions involved: - The right-hand side ( q^3 - r^3 ) must be analyzed for its parity. If both ( q ) and ( r ) are odd, their cubes will also be odd, leading to a difference of two odd numbers, which is even. The left-hand side ( 11p ) is odd since 11 is odd and ( p ) is a prime number (thus non-zero). - If ( q ) and ( r ) have the same parity (both odd or both even), the right-hand side would be even, which contradicts the left-hand side being odd. Thus, one of ( q ) or ( r ) must be even. 3. The only even prime number is 2. Therefore, either ( q ) or ( r ) must be 2. 4. ( q ) must be greater than ( r ) (( q > r )), so we test the following cases: - *Case 1:* Assume ( r = 2 ). 1. Substitute ( r = 2 ) into the equation: [ 11p = q^3 - 2^3 = q^3 - 8 ] 2.

For instance, if x = (x_1, x_2, x_3, ldots, x_n), then bar{x} = (bar{x}_1, bar{x}_2, bar{x}_3, ldots, bar{x}_n) where bar{x}_j = 1 - x_j for 1 le j le n. For any two sequences x and y of length n, their product xy refers to sequence z = (z_1, z_2, z_3, ldots, z_n), where z_j = x_j y_j for 1 le j le n. Define the set S to contain all 2^{n-1} such sequences. Step 2: Complement Condition **Lemma 1**: For any x in S, we have bar{x} in S. **Proof**: Assume if x notin S and bar{x} notin S, due to the pairing of sequences and their complements, this would result in fewer than 2^{n-1} sequences in S, contradicting the problem's conditions. Thus, we must have for every x in S, its complement bar{x} must also belong to S to satisfy the required number of sequences. Step 3: Product Condition **Lemma 2**: If x, y in S, then xy in S. **Proof**: - Suppose xy notin S. - By Lemma 1, overline{xy} in S. - Examine x, y, and overline{xy}: - For any position where overline{xy} is 1, xy is 0, implying at least one of x or y is 0 at that position. - Thus, no position can have all three sequences (x, y, overline{xy}) being 1 simultaneously. - This would contradict the condition that any set of 3 sequences must have a common 1 at some position. Therefore, the product of any two sequences in S must also be in S. Step 4: Existence of Especial Position k **Lemma 3**: There exists a natural number k such that in all sequences in S, the k-th position is 1. **Proof**: - Consider the product sequence x_0 from all sequences in S by taking element-wise product: x_0 = prod_{x in S} x - x_0 is composed of 1s and at least n-1 zeros. - By Lemma 2, x_0 in S, and thus it's not entirely composed of zeros. - If x_0 contains two or more 1s, then S would include only sequences where these positions are 1, making S less than 2^{n-1} contradicting the given size. - Hence, x_0 must have exactly one 1 at some position k, and all sequences in S must have 1 at the k-th position.

And what is the minimum cost?","completion":"# Solution: Part 1: Finding the Price per Box Let's denote the price per box of brand A salted duck eggs as a yuan, and the price per box of brand B salted duck eggs as b yuan. Given the information, we can set up the following system of equations: 1. For 9 boxes of A and 6 boxes of B: 9a + 6b = 390 2. For 5 boxes of A and 8 boxes of B: 5a + 8b = 310 Solving this system, we start by multiplying the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 9 to eliminate a: - (9a + 6b) times 5 = 390 times 5 Rightarrow 45a + 30b = 1950 - (5a + 8b) times 9 = 310 times 9 Rightarrow 45a + 72b = 2790 Subtracting the first new equation from the second gives us: - 45a + 72b - (45a + 30b) = 2790 - 1950 - 42b = 840 Rightarrow b = 20 Substituting b = 20 into the first original equation: - 9a + 6(20) = 390 Rightarrow 9a + 120 = 390 - 9a = 270 Rightarrow a = 30 Therefore, the price per box of brand A salted duck eggs is 30 yuan, and the price per box of brand B salted duck eggs is 20 yuan.

The total cost, w, in yuan is given by: w = 30x + 20(30-x) = 10x + 600 This shows that the total cost w increases as x increases. Given the conditions that the quantity of brand A must be at least 5 boxes more than brand B but not exceeding twice the quantity of brand B, we have the inequalities: 1. x geq (30-x) + 5 2. x leq 2(30-x) Solving these inequalities: - From x geq (30-x) + 5, we get x geq 35 - x Rightarrow 2x geq 35 Rightarrow x geq 17.5 - From x leq 2(30-x), we get x leq 60 - 2x Rightarrow 3x leq 60 Rightarrow x leq 20 Therefore, 17.5 leq x leq 20.

The resulting Cu+ ions can then form a complex with neocuproine, leading to a measurable change in absorbance or fluorescence. This change can be used to quantify the amount of Cu+ ions present in a sample. By using neocuproine as a detector, the US-mediated Cu2+-Cu+ conversion can be monitored in real-time.

Sulfate radicals are highly reactive species that are often involved in various chemical and oxidative processes. When RhB is exposed to sulfate radicals, it undergoes a reaction that leads to the quenching of its fluorescence. This quenching occurs due to the reaction between the sulfate radicals and the RhB molecule. The sulfate radicals oxidize the organic moiety of the dye, resulting in a loss of fluorescence. This quenching can be easily detected and quantified using fluorescence spectroscopy. By monitoring the decrease in fluorescence intensity of RhB, the generation of sulfate radicals can be indirectly measured. The decrease in fluorescence intensity is directly proportional to the concentration of sulfate radicals present in the system. Therefore, RhB can serve as a sensitive and effective probe to investigate and monitor the production of sulfate radicals in different chemical and environmental systems. This capability is particularly useful for studying oxidative processes, environmental pollution, and the evaluation of various oxidation treatments or processes."},{"prompt":"UV-vis absorbance spectra of RhB as a probe to detect the generation of •SO4−.","completion":"The UV-vis absorbance spectrum of RhB can be used to detect the generation of •SO4−. Typically, RhB exhibits a peak absorbance at around 554 nm in its normal state. However, in the presence of •SO4−, the absorbance spectrum undergoes a shift or change in intensity. When •SO4− reacts with RhB, it can cause various changes in the conjugated system of the dye molecule, leading to a modification in its absorption properties. This alteration can result in a shift in the maximum absorbance wavelength or a change in the intensity of the absorbance peak. To detect the generation of •SO4− using RhB as a probe, a baseline absorbance spectrum of RhB can be measured under normal conditions. Then, when •SO4− is generated, a new absorbance spectrum is obtained and compared to the baseline spectrum. If there is a shift in the position of the absorption peak or a significant change in the intensity of the peak, it indicates that •SO4− has reacted with RhB, leading to modifications in the dye's conjugated system. This change in the UV-vis spectrum can be attributed to the interaction between •SO4− and RhB and can serve as an indirect indication of the presence of •SO4−. Therefore, by monitoring the UV-vis absorbance spectrum of RhB in the presence of •SO4−, one can detect and quantify the generation of sulfate radicals in a given system."},{"prompt":"RhB as a probe to detect the generation of •SO4− and •OH rate constants","completion":"RhB can also be used as a probe to determine the rate constants for the reactions involving the generation of •SO4− and •OH radicals. The rate constants can be determined by monitoring the decay of RhB fluorescence in the presence of these radicals. The decay of RhB fluorescence follows first-order kinetics, where the rate of decay is directly proportional to the concentration of the radicals. By measuring the fluorescence intensity of RhB over time, the decay rate constant can be determined using the following equation: ln(I0/I) = kobs × t where I0 is the initial fluorescence intensity, I is the fluorescence intensity at time t, and kobs is the observed rate constant. To determine the rate constants for the reactions involving •SO4− and •OH, RhB is typically exposed to known concentrations of these radicals. The fluorescence intensity of RhB is measured at regular intervals, and the decay rate constants are calculated. By performing these measurements at different concentrations of •SO4− and •OH, it is possible to determine the rate constants for the reactions between RhB and these radicals. These rate constants provide important information about the reactivity of the radicals and their ability to oxidize or react with other compounds. By using RhB as a probe, it is possible to study and compare the reactivity of different radicals and assess their potential applications in various chemical and environmental processes."},{"prompt":"density functional theory plus on-site repulsion U (DFT+U) calculations were performed to investigate the electronic structures of Cu@P NCs.","completion":"Density functional theory plus on-site repulsion U (DFT+U) calculations can be used to study the electronic structures of Cu@P NCs (Copper@Phosphorus Nanoclusters). DFT is a computational method used to calculate electronic structure properties of atoms, molecules, and materials. It is based on solving the Schrödinger equation numerically, taking into account the electron-electron interactions and the exchange-correlation effects. However, standard DFT functionals can often underestimate or incorrectly predict certain properties, such as the electronic structure of transition metal systems. To address this issue, on-site repulsion U can be incorporated into the DFT calculations, resulting in DFT+U. U is a parameter that adjusts the on-site Coulomb interaction between electrons on a specific orbital of an atom. This correction helps to improve the accuracy of DFT calculations for systems with localized electron states or strong electron-electron correlations, such as transition metals. In the case of Cu@P NCs, DFT+U calculations can provide important insights into the electronic structure, bonding, and properties of the nanoclusters. These calculations can help determine the energy levels, bandgaps, and the nature of electronic transitions within the nanoclusters. Additionally, DFT+U can provide information about the distribution and hybridization of electron orbitals on both copper and phosphorus atoms, as well as the charge density distribution within the system. Overall, DFT+U calculations can be a valuable tool to understand and predict the electronic structures of Cu@P NCs, helping in the design and optimization of these nanoclusters for various applications in catalysis, electronics, and energy storage."},{"prompt":"Electrons spin distributions with a maximum spin concentration are concentrated at TBP-Cu and TBP-O, with little attributions from OCT-Cu and OCT-O.","completion":"The electron spin distributions in a system are influenced by several factors, including the electronic configuration of the atoms involved, their chemical environment, bonding, and the presence of magnetic interactions. Without specific details regarding the context of the TBP-Cu, TBP-O, OCT-Cu, and OCT-O systems, it is challenging to provide an accurate analysis of the electron spin distributions. However, based on the information provided, we can make some general assumptions. Assuming that TBP refers to a copper complex containing a tridentate ligand, and OCT refers to a different ligand, it is plausible to speculate that the differences in electron spin distributions are influenced by the nature and geometry of the ligands. In this case, it seems that the TBP ligand results in a higher concentration or contribution to the electron spin distribution at the Cu and O atoms compared to the OCT ligand. This could be attributed to specific ligand-field effects, electronic interactions, or differences in the coordination environment around the copper and oxygen atoms. Without further knowledge about the specific ligands, their structures, and the nature of the system, it is challenging to provide more detailed insights into the electron spin distributions. Additional experimental or computational studies, such as density functional theory calculations or spectroscopic measurements, would provide a more accurate characterization of the electron spin distributions in these systems."},{"prompt":"Расскажи о компании Patagonia: проект “Worn Wear”","completion":"Patagonia - это американская компания, специализирующаяся на производстве одежды, обуви, снаряжения и аксессуаров для активного отдыха и спорта. Компания была основана в 1973 году Йвоном Шувонар и специализировалась на производстве высококачественной продукции, которая прочна, функциональна и экологически безопасна. Одним из проектов, запущенных компанией Patagonia, является \\"Worn Wear\\" (в переводе с английского \\"Износ\\"), который нацелен на сохранение и продление срока службы продукции Patagonia, а также решение проблемы потребительского потребления. Проект стартовал в 2013 году и представляет собой программу обслуживания и вторичной продажи продукции Patagonia. Главная идея \\"Worn Wear\\" заключается в том, чтобы владельцы продукции Patagonia не выбрасывали изношенные или поврежденные вещи, а вместо этого осуществляли их ремонт, чтобы продлить срок их использования. В рамках программы Patagonia предлагает услуги по ремонту и обслуживанию своих изделий, включая швейных работ, замену застежек-молний и ремонт дефектов материалов. Это позволяет пользователям продолжать пользоваться своей одеждой и снаряжением в течение длительного времени, вместо того чтобы покупать новые вещи каждый раз, когда старые износятся. Кроме того, Patagonia также разрабатывает программу вторичной продажи продукции, чтобы предложить клиентам возможность приобрести бывшие в употреблении вещи по более доступной цене. Патагония также принимает на обслуживание и ремонт вещи других производителей, попадающие под принципы \\"Worn Wear\\". Основная цель проекта \\"Worn Wear\\" - сократить отходы и создать более устойчивую модель потребления, где потребители станут относиться к своим вещам через линзу экономии ресурсов и защиты окружающей среды. Patagonia подчеркивает важность долговечности и качества продукции, а также восстановления и продления срока службы изделий. Проект \\"Worn Wear\\" стал неотъемлемой частью деловой модели Patagonia и иллюстрирует их позицию в глобальном движении по борьбе с потребительским потреблением и стремлению к устойчивому развитию."},{"prompt":"Why economics is called dismal science","completion":"Economics is sometimes referred to as the \\"dismal science\\" because it often deals with concepts and theories that may have negative or pessimistic implications. The term was initially coined by Scottish writer and philosopher Thomas Carlyle in the 19th century. Carlyle used the term to criticize the views of economists who argued that social problems, such as poverty and inequality, were natural consequences of economic systems and could not be easily resolved. He believed that the focus on market forces and individual self-interest, which are central to economic analysis, overlooked the importance of moral and ethical considerations. Since then, the term \\"dismal science\\" has come to represent the perceived gloomy or pessimistic conclusions that economists sometimes draw from their analysis. This can include discussions about trade-offs, scarcity, and the unintended consequences of policies. However, it is worth noting that economics is a valuable field of study that provides important insights and tools for understanding and improving the functioning of economies. The term \\"dismal science\\" is more of a critique of the limitations and potential negative implications of economic theories rather than an accurate description of the entire discipline."},{"prompt":"Расскажи о Компания Airbnb: проект “Open Homes”","completion":"Компания Airbnb - это онлайн-платформа для аренды жилья, которая позволяет людям сдавать свои дома или квартиры путешественникам на короткий срок.

Organizing the Federal Government (include the Supreme Court): 80% Jefferson demonstrated strong organizational abilities in establishing the foundation for the federal government and reorganizing it to reflect his Democratic-Republican ideals. His creation of the Library of Congress and the establishment of the Supreme Court were noteworthy achievements. However, there were some challenges with the appointment of certain judges, resulting in a slightly lower grade. 2. Domestic Policy: 85% Jefferson’s domestic policy initiatives greatly contributed to the growth and development of the nation. He successfully reduced the national debt, implemented the Embargo Act, and supported agricultural and educational reforms. Despite initial setbacks with the Embargo Act, Jefferson's overall impact on domestic policies warrants a high grade. 3. Foreign Policy: 70% While Jefferson initially pursued a neutral and non-interventionist foreign policy, there were certain instances where he deviated from this stance. His handling of the Barbary Pirates conflict and the Louisiana Purchase were controversial and raised concerns about potential threats to Democratic-Republican ideals. These factors contributed to a lower grade in this category. 4. Maintaining Democratic-Republican Ideals: 90% Thomas Jefferson consistently prioritized the protection of individual liberties and states' rights, aligning with the Democratic-Republican ideals. He championed the importance of agrarianism, limited government, and strict interpretation of the Constitution. His role in successfully defeating the Federalist Party and his advocacy for the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions solidify his high grade in this category."},{"prompt":"you need to distribute 8 percentuals between these 4 categories,","completion":"I apologize for the oversight.
