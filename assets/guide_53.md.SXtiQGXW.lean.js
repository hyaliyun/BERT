P, Q, and O must lie on the line perpendicular to plane ABC through the circumcenter K of triangle ABC since they are equidistant from each vertex of the triangle. Let's denote KP = x, KQ = y, and KO = d. Since O is equidistant from P and Q, O is the midpoint of line segment PQ. Therefore, d = frac{x+y}{2}. Considering the dihedral angle to be 90^circ, the relation between x, y, and d can be obtained by setting the angle angle PKQ = 90^circ. Thus, x^2 + y^2 = 4d^2 (using Pythagorean theorem in triangle PKQ). Solve for x and y: Assuming symmetry and the fact that O is the midpoint, x = y.

The circles in which these quadrilaterals are inscribed are the ones with diameters ( AA_1 ), ( BB_1 ), and ( CC_1 ) respectively. 3. **Intersections of the Cyclic Quadrilaterals**: - Within each of these cyclic quadrilaterals, the point ( M ) (the orthocenter) satisfies certain power of a point relations. From the power of a point theorem applied to ( M ) with respect to each of the circles, we have: [ MA cdot MA_1 = MB cdot MB_1 = MC cdot MC_1 ] Here, these equations state that the power of the orthocenter ( M ) with respect to each circle is the same. 4. **Common Chords and Power of a Point**: - The common chords of these circles are critical. By the property of the power of a point, since the point ( M ) has equal power with respect to all three circles, it must lie on the radical axes (common chords) of the pairs of circles. - Specifically, the radical axis (line consisting of points that have equal power with respect to two circles) of any two circles is the line joining their common chords. - For instance, the common chord of the circles with diameters ( AA_1 ) and ( BB_1 ) intersects the circle with diameter ( CC_1 ) at point ( M ). 5. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, the common chords of these circles, corresponding to the sides of the cyclic quadrilaterals, intersect each other at the orthocenter ( M ). Hence, it is proven that the common chords of the circles drawn with the altitudes of a triangle as diameters intersect at the orthocenter of the triangle: [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"f the infinite arithmetic sequence {a_{n}} has a first term a_{1} gt 0 and a common difference d lt 0, and the sum of the first n terms of the sequence is S_{n}, then which of the following is true?

Given that the compound has 7 carbon atoms and 2 oxygen atoms, we can calculate the contribution of these atoms to the molecular weight as follows: 7 C atoms * 12.01 (atomic weight of C) = 84.07 2 O atoms * 16.00 (atomic weight of O) = 32.00 Adding these together gives us the total weight of the carbon and oxygen atoms in the molecule: 84.07 (from C) + 32.00 (from O) = 116.07 The molecular weight of the compound is given as 122. To find the contribution of hydrogen atoms to the molecular weight, we subtract the weight of the carbon and oxygen atoms from the total molecular weight: 122 (total molecular weight) - 116.07 (weight of C and O) = 5.93 Now, we divide this remaining weight by the atomic weight of hydrogen to find the number of hydrogen atoms: 5.93 / 1.008 (atomic weight of H) ≈ 5.88 Since we can't have a fraction of an atom, we round to the nearest whole number.

One horizontal brick of size ( 1 times 2 ) arranged side by side Thus, (mathcal{F}_2 = 2). 2. **Recursive Formula:** We observe that the number of ways to pave a strip of length ( n ) can be related to previously computed values. Specifically, for ( n geq 3 ): - **Case 1:** The last brick placed is vertical (size ( 2 times 1 )). The remaining strip to be paved is then of size ( 2 times (n - 1) ). The number of ways to pave this strip is (mathcal{F}_{n-1}). - **Case 2:** The last brick placed is horizontal (size ( 1 times 2 )).

We need to prove that there are at least two equal integers in the grid. 2. **Applying the Principle**: Let's denote the minimum integer in the grid as ( a ). Due to the condition given (each pair of neighboring integers differ by at most 5), the maximum integer in the grid cannot exceed ( a + 95 ). 3. **Calculating the Range**: The grid is (10 times 10), which contains 100 cells. Given that each integer in the grid is within the range from ( a ) to ( a + 95 ), the number of possible distinct integer values is: [ a, a + 1, a + 2, ldots, a + 95 ] Hence, the total number of distinct possible values is: [ 95 - 0 + 1 = 96 ] 4. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle**: Since there are 100 cells but only 96 possible distinct values, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least two cells that contain the same integer. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if ( n ) items are put into ( m ) containers, with ( n > m ), at least one container must contain more than one item.

To find ST, we use the fact that PT = RT = 10, which implies T lies on the circle with radius 10 centered at P and also centered at R. This means T is directly opposite Q on the line extending through R perpendicular to PR. The length of ST can be calculated by recognizing that triangle PRT is isosceles with PT = RT = 10 and PR = 10. Thus, ST is the altitude from P to TR, and since PRT is also a right triangle, ST is half of TR. Since PT = RT, the length of TR is same as PR, which is 10, and hence ST = 5.

If we choose a point to split the total string of flags into two, we need to ensure that there are at least two blue flags on each side.

Let ( F_k = {A subset S mid |A| = 31, |A| equiv k pmod{5}} ), for ( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ). 5. For any ( A in F_0 ) with ( A = {x_1, x_2, dots, x_{31}} ), define the function: [ f_k(A) = {x_1 + k, x_2 + k, dots, x_{31} + k } quad text{for } k = 1, 2, 3, 4, ] where if ( x_i + k > 1990 ), we understand it as ( x_i + k - 1990 ). 6. Since ( 31k equiv k pmod{5} ) and ( 1990 equiv 0 pmod{5} ), it follows that ( f_k(A) in F_k ). 7. It is evident that the mapping ( f_k ) is a bijection from ( F_0 ) to ( F_k ), so we have: [ |F_0| = |F_1| = |F_2| = |F_3| = |F_4|. ] 8. Since the sets ( F_0, F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4 ) are mutually disjoint and their union covers all possible 31-element subsets of ( S ), we know that: [ sum_{k=0}^{4} |F_k| = binom{1990}{31}. ] 9. Consequently, the number of good subsets, which is ( |F_0| ), is: [ |F_0| = frac{1}{5} binom{1990}{31}. ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{1}{5} binom{1990}{31}} ]"},{"prompt":"A prism has 21 edges.

Find the number of happy polynomials of degree ( n ) or less.","completion":"1. **Understanding the problem setup:** We are given a polynomial of degree ( n ) or less: [ f(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i x^i ] where each coefficient ( a_i ) satisfies ( 0 leq a_i < 1 ), and ( f(x) ) must be an integer for all integer ( x ). Such polynomials are referred to as happy polynomials. 2. **Base case for ( n = 1 ):** For ( n = 1 ): [ f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x ] Given that ( 0 leq a_0, a_1 < 1 ) and ( f(x) ) must be an integer for integer ( x ), both ( a_0 ) and ( a_1 ) must be ( 0 ). Hence, there is exactly one happy polynomial of degree 1, which is ( f(x) = 0 ). 3. **Induction hypothesis:** Assume there are ( 1! cdot 2! cdots (n-1)! ) happy polynomials of degree at most ( n-1 ). 4. **Induction step:** We need to show there are ( n! ) times as many happy polynomials of degree at most ( n ) as of degree at most ( n-1 ). 5. **Leading coefficient form:** Let ( f(x) ) be a happy polynomial of degree ( n ). We claim that its leading coefficient ( a_n ) is of the form ( frac{c}{n!} ) for some integer ( c ). 6. **Using Lagrange interpolation:** Consider Lagrange interpolation for constructing ( f(x) ): [ f_0(x) = sum_{0 leq k leq n} left( f(k) prod_{substack{0 leq j leq n j neq k}} frac{x - j}{k - j} right) ] ( f_0(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( n ) with rational coefficients and satisfies ( f_0(x) = f(x) ) for ( x = 0, 1, ldots, n ). Thus, ( f_0 = f ). 7. **Leading coefficient analysis:** The leading coefficient of ( f(x) = f_0(x) ) is computed as a sum of terms of the form: [ frac{1}{(-k)(-k+1) cdots (-2)(-1) cdot 1 cdot 2 cdots (n - k)} cdot f(k) = frac{pm 1}{k! cdot (n-k)!} f(k) = frac{pm binom{n}{k}}{n!} f(k) ] Therefore, the leading coefficient is indeed of the form ( frac{c}{n!} ) for some integer ( c ). 8. **Bound on integer ( c ):** Given ( 0 leq a_n < 1 ), it follows ( 0 leq c < n! ). 9. **Constructing bijection:** Given a happy polynomial ( f(x) ) and its leading coefficient ( frac{c}{n!} ), define: [ g(x) = f(x) - c frac{x(x-1) cdots (x-n+1)}{n!} ] ( g(x) ) is a polynomial of degree at most ( n-1 ). For integers ( x geq n ), the fraction in ( g(x) ) becomes the integer ( binom{x}{n} ), so ( g(x) ) is an integer for all integers ( x ). 10. **Reducing coefficients modulo 1:** Let ( h(x) ) be the polynomial formed by reducing coefficients of ( g(x) ) modulo 1 into the interval ( [0,1) ). This is equivalent to forming a happy polynomial. 11. **Conclusion on number of happy polynomials:** The mapping ( f(x) mapsto h(x) ) provides a bijection between: - Happy polynomials of degree ( leq n ) with ( n )-th degree coefficient ( frac{c}{n!} ). - Happy polynomials of degree ( leq n-1 ). Since ( c ) has ( n! ) possible values, we conclude that there are ( n! ) times as many happy polynomials of degree ( leq n ) as of degree ( leq n-1 ).

Time taken to cover 9 km at 45 kmph is given by: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 9 km / 45 kmph To convert the speed to km per minute, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 45 kmph = 45/60 km/min = 0.75 km/min Now, we can calculate the time: Time = 9 km / 0.75 km/min Time = 12 minutes Therefore, the train stops for boxed{12} minutes per hour."},{"prompt":"Given the function y=f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the domain [2,4] and f(a+1) > f(2a), the range of a is (quad) A: 1 < a leqslant 2 B: 1 < a leqslant 1 C: 3 < a leqslant 3 D: a < frac {1}{3}","completion":"Since the function y=f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the domain [-2,4] and f(a+1) > f(2a), we have the following conditions: [ begin{cases} -2 leqslant a+1 leqslant 4 -2 leqslant 2a leqslant 4 a+1 < 2a end{cases} ] Solving these, we get 1 < a leqslant 2.

The condition for f(x) to be monotonically increasing is f'(x) geq 0 for all x in mathbb{R}. 2. Calculating the derivative, we get f'(x) = 2 - 2(a+1)e^{x} + 2ae^{2x}. 3. Letting t = e^{x} (since e^{x} > 0 for all x), we rewrite the inequality as at^{2} - (a+1)t + 1 geq 0 for all t > 0. 4. Define g(t) = at^{2} - (a+1)t + 1. Noting that g(1) = 0, we analyze the conditions for g(t) geq 0. 5. For g(t) geq 0 to hold for all t > 0, we require a > 0 and the discriminant Delta = (a+1)^{2} - 4a leq 0. 6. Simplifying the discriminant condition gives (a-1)^{2} leq 0, which implies a = 1. Therefore, for f(x) to be monotonically increasing, we have a = 1. So, the value of a is boxed{a=1}. # Part (Ⅱ): Sum of Roots Given x_{1} and x_{2} (x_{1} < x_{2}) are real roots of f(x) = ae^{2x}, we need to prove x_{1} + x_{2} > 2. 1. The given equation implies x_{1} and x_{2} are roots of a = frac{x}{{e}^{x}} - 1. 2. Define h(x) = frac{x}{{e}^{x}} - 1. The derivative h'(x) = frac{1-x}{{e}^{x}} indicates h(x) is increasing for x < 1. 3. Since h(x) increases on (-infty, 1) and decreases on (1, +infty), we have x_{1} < 1 < x_{2}. 4. Define H(x) = h(x) - h(2-x) for x < 1. The derivative H'(x) = h'(x) + h'(2-x) simplifies to e^{x-2}(x-1)(1-e^{2-2x}) > 0 for x < 1. 5. Since H(x) is increasing on (-infty, 1), we have H(x) < H(1), implying h(x) < h(2-x). 6. Therefore, h(x_{1}) < h(2-x_{1}) leads to x_{2} > 2-x_{1}, which implies x_{1} + x_{2} > 2.

Find all ( n ) such that we can always end up with all zeros whatever the size or content of the starting table.","completion":"1. **Observation about invariants:** We start by examining the invariance properties of the table entries under the allowed operations, which consist of: - Subtracting ( n ) from every element in a column. - Multiplying every element in a row by ( n ). Specifically, we observe how these operations affect the entries modulo ( n-1 ). 2. **Modulo ( n-1 ) Analysis:** - **Subtracting ( n ) from a column:** This operation does not change the entries modulo ( n-1 ). If an entry is ( x ), then its new value is ( x - n ). However: [ x - n equiv x - (n-1 + 1) equiv x - 1 pmod{n-1} ] Given ( -1 equiv n-1 pmod{n-1} ), this transformation doesn't change the remainder modulo ( n-1 ). - **Multiplying a row by ( n ):** If an entry is ( x ), then its new value is ( x cdot n ). Considering that ( n equiv 1 pmod{n-1} ), we have: [ x cdot n equiv x cdot 1 = x pmod{n-1} ] Thus, both operations leave the entries unchanged modulo ( n-1 ). 3. **Implications when ( n > 2 ):** For ( n > 2 ), any entry that is not initially a multiple of ( n-1 ) cannot be made zero, because the value modulo ( n-1 ) remains constant. Therefore, zeroing the entire table is impossible unless every entry was a multiple of ( n-1 ) initially, which isn't guaranteed. 4. **Special Cases ( n = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ):** - **For ( n = 1 ):** - Subtracting 1 from a column repeatedly will achieve zeroes. However, multiplication by 1 does not change entries. - If there are at least two rows and a column where not all elements are initially the same, we cannot achieve all zeros efficiently, as the row operation (multiplication by 1) is ineffective. Thus, ( n = 1 ) cannot guarantee the desired outcome. - **For ( n = 2 ):** - Subtraction of 2 reduces all entries by 2. - Multiplying by 2 doubles all entries in a row, but does not create any non-integer values if we're starting with positive integers. 5. **Strategy to Zero the Table when ( n = 2 ):** Assume any starting configuration of the table: a. **Ensure all entries in a row are even:** - Iterate through rows. For each row, if it contains any odd number (i.e., not divisible by 2), multiply that row by 2 so that all entries become even numbers. b. **Zero Out Columns Step-by-Step:** - Choose a column. All entries in this column are even. Let the largest entry in this column be ( 2m ). - Subtract 2 from all elements in that column until the maximal entry reaches zero. This reduction step-by-step will still keep the column numbers even. - If required, treat any ( 2k ) as ( k times 2 ), and if some entries turn into 4 or higher, use subtraction steps repeatedly to reduce them back to regular evens. 6. **Repeating the Process:** Repeat the above process for each column until all columns are zero. Since each iteration reduces the table and no odd numbers remain at any step (ensuring that all numbers involved are managed to be reduced by a factor), we can systematically zero out the entire table. # Conclusion: The only value of ( n ) for which we can always reduce the table to all zeros, irrespective of the size or content of the starting table, is ( n = 2 ).

Next, note that ( n(n-1)(n+1) ) represents the product of three consecutive integers: [ n(n-1)(n+1) = k(k+1)(k+2). ] It is a known fact that the product of any three consecutive integers is divisible by ( text{lcm}(1, 2, 3) = 6 ), meaning this portion of the expression is divisible by 6. 4. Additionally, consider ( n, (n-1), (n+1), (n-2), (n+2) ). These five values cover all residues modulo 5. Thus, their product is divisible by ( text{lcm}(1, 5) = 5 ). 5.

Knowing that left{frac{1}{T_{n}}right} is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 2 and common difference 1, we can express the n-th term as: [ frac{1}{T_{n}} = n + 1 ] This implies that T_{n} = frac{1}{n+1}. For n geq 2, we find the expression for a_{n}: [ a_{n} = frac{T_{n}}{T_{n-1}} = frac{frac{1}{n+1}}{frac{1}{n}} = frac{n}{n+1} ] This formula also holds for a_{1} = frac{1}{2}. Therefore, for any n, we have a_{n} = frac{n}{n+1}. The difference between consecutive terms of {a_{n}} normalized by the preceding term is: [ frac{a_{n+1} - a_{n}}{a_{n}} = frac{frac{n+1}{n+2} - frac{n}{n+1}}{frac{n}{n+1}} = frac{1}{n(n+2)} = frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n+2}right) ] Summing these differences from a_{1} to a_{n} gives us: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{a_{k+1} - a_{k}}{a_{k}} = frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{1} - frac{1}{3}right) + frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{4}right) + ldots + frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n+2}right) ] This simplifies to: [ frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{n+1} - frac{1}{n+2}right) = frac{3}{4} - frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{n+1} + frac{1}{n+2}right) ] Since frac{1}{n+1} + frac{1}{n+2} > 0, we conclude that: [ frac{3}{4} - frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{n+1} + frac{1}{n+2}right) < frac{3}{4} ] Therefore, we have proven that: [ boxed{frac{a_{2} - a_{1}}{a_{1}} + frac{a_{3} - a_{2}}{a_{2}} + ldots + frac{a_{n+1} - a_{n}}{a_{n}} < frac{3}{4}} ]"},{"prompt":"Denote by ( d(n) ) the number of positive divisors of a positive integer ( n ).

An example could be a polyhedron that is not necessarily outwardly bulging (non-convex) with all square faces. - **Illustration**: Figure 55 in the source represents an example of such a non-convex polyhedron. This polyhedron has all faces as squares but is not convex. # Conclusion: - For convex polyhedra: The only possible polyhedron with all square faces that is convex is the cube. - For non-convex polyhedra: There exist infinitely many non-convex polyhedra where all faces are equal squares. Therefore, for convex polyhedra, the answer to whether there exist such polyhedra other than the cube is negative. For non-convex polyhedra, such polyhedra do exist in numerous forms.

This means the domain is not symmetric about the origin, which is a requirement for odd functions. Therefore, f(x) in Option A does not meet the criteria for being an odd function. - **Option B:** f(x)=xsin x - This function is not purely odd or even. However, since the sine function has both positive and negative values and is multiplied by x, it does not guarantee that f(x) is an odd function. Moreover, the presence of x in the product makes it not strictly an even function, but the primary reason it does not meet the criteria is because it is not guaranteed to be odd due to its composition. - **Option C:** f(x)=x-frac{1}{x} - This function is odd because f(-x) = -f(x). However, it is not monotonically increasing over its entire domain. For x > 0, as x increases, f(x) increases, but for x < 0, as x decreases (becomes more negative), f(x) decreases.

Additionally, the derivative of f(x), which is f'(x) = e^{x} + e^{-x}, is always positive for all x in its domain, indicating that f(x) is monotonically increasing.

Since the parabola passes through the point (3, 6), we have: 6^2 = 2 cdot p cdot 3 Solving for p, we get p=6. Therefore, the equation of the parabola is: y^2 = 12x. Let's denote the intersection points of the line y=2x-6 and the parabola as A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2). From the system of equations: begin{cases} y^2=12x y=2x-6 end{cases} we can substitute y^2 from the second equation into the first to get: (2x-6)^2 = 12x Simplifying the above equation gives us: x^2 - 9x + 9 = 0 By Vieta's formulas, we have x_1 + x_2 = 9 and x_1 cdot x_2 = 9.

Therefore, the line and the parabola intersect at two points when k < 3. When Delta = 4(k-6)^2 - 4k^2 < 0, we find by solving that k > 3.

Considering the geometry: [ psi = pi - frac{pi}{4} - varphi = frac{3pi}{4} - varphi ] Thus: [ Pi = S cos varphi + S cos left( frac{3pi}{4} - varphi right) ] 5. To find the maximum value of Pi, consider the derivative Pi' = 0: [ Pi' = S left( -sin varphi + sin left( frac{3pi}{4} - varphi right) right) ] Setting this derivative to zero: [ left( -sin varphi + sin left( frac{3pi}{4} - varphi right) right) = 0 ] Solving for varphi: [ -sin varphi + sin left( frac{3pi}{4} - varphi right) = 0 ] [ sin left( frac{3pi}{4} - varphi right) = sin varphi ] The solution occurs when: [ varphi = frac{3pi}{8} ] At this angle, the area Pi reaches its maximum in the given range, confirming: [ Pi = S ] 6. Lastly, for rotation angles 90^circ < varphi < 135^circ, the projection area is given by: [ Pi = S cos left( frac{pi}{2} - varphi right) = S sin varphi < S ] At an angle varphi = frac{3pi}{4}, the projection area: [ Pi = S ] # Conclusion: The greatest projection area of the rotating tetrahedron on a plane containing the common edge of the two faces is: [ boxed{Pi = S = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}} ]"},{"prompt":"Suppose all four of the numbers [3 sqrt{2},; 5 + sqrt{3},; 8 2sqrt{7},; 2sqrt{2}] are roots of the same nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients.

There are two cases: when the slope exists and when it does not. When the slope exists, let the slope of the line be k. Use the coordinates of P to write the equation of the line. Use the formula for the distance from a point to a line to express the distance d from the center of the circle to the line. Set d equal to the calculated chordal distance to derive an equation in terms of k. Solving this equation will yield the value of k, determining the equation of the line. When the slope does not exist, since the distance from the center of the circle to the line x=-3 is equal to the chordal distance 3, it is clear that the line x=-3 meets the requirements. Thus, the equations of the two lines that meet the requirements are obtained. This problem tests students' mastery of the perpendicular diameter theorem and the Pythagorean theorem, the flexible application of the formula for the distance from a point to a line to simplify and solve, and examines the mathematical thinking of discussing cases, making it a medium-difficulty problem. Students may overlook the case where the slope does not exist. **Solution** Given the equation of the circle x^2+y^2=25, we find the center of the circle at (0,0) with a radius r=5. Since the chord length intersected by the circle is 8, according to the perpendicular diameter theorem, the distance from the center of the circle to the line, which is the chordal distance, is sqrt{5^2-4^2}=3. When the slope of the desired line exists, let the equation of the line be: y+frac{3}{2}=k(x+3), which simplifies to kx-y+3k-frac{3}{2}=0. Thus, the distance from the center of the circle to the line d=frac{|3k-frac{3}{2}|}{sqrt{1+k^2}}=3. Simplifying gives: 9k=frac{9}{4}-9, which means k=-frac{3}{4}. Therefore, the equation of the desired line is: 3x+4y+15=0. When the slope of the desired line does not exist, it is clear that the equation of the line is: x=-3. In conclusion, the equations of the lines that meet the requirements are x=-3 or 3x+4y+15=0.

For 126 and m to share exactly three positive divisors ( {1, p, p^2} ), where ( p ) is a prime factor, m must also have 3 as a prime factor and be of the form 3^2 times some other factors that do not introduce new squares or higher powers of primes into its prime factorization.

Since 1 leq k leq p-1, neither k nor p-k equals p. Hence: [ k! = k cdot (k-1) cdot (k-2) cdot ldots cdot 2 cdot 1 ] and [ (p-k)! = (p-k) cdot (p-k-1) cdot ldots cdot 2 cdot 1 ] 4.

Recall that ( binom{n}{4} = frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24} ). For ( binom{n}{4} ) to be divisible by ( 10000 = 2^4 cdot 5^4 ), the numerator ( n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) ) must be divisible by ( 2^7 cdot 5^4 ) because ( 24 = 2^3 cdot 3 ). 3. First, consider the divisibility by ( 5^4 = 625 ). One of ( n, n-1, n-2, n-3 ) must be divisible by 625, since if 5 divides one of them, then 5 cannot divide any of the others. 4.

This provides us with a specific point that the function must satisfy. Substituting x = 0 and y = 2 into the linear function equation y = kx + b, we get 2 = k(0) + b, leading to b = 2.

We will use mathematical induction for the proof. 1. **Base cases:** - For n = F_2 = 2: [ text{Player A takes 1 match, and Player B takes 1 match, winning the game.} ] - For n = F_3 = 3: [ text{Player A takes 1 match, and Player B takes 2 matches, winning the game.} ] 2. **Inductive step:** Suppose the hypothesis holds for n = F_m and n = F_{m-1} for m geq 3. We need to show it holds for n = F_{m+1}. If Player A takes r geq F_{m-1} matches on their turn, then the remaining number of matches is: [ F_{m+1} - r leq F_{m+1} - F_{m-1} = F_m = F_{m-1} + F_{m-2} < 2F_{m-1} ] So, Player B can take all remaining matches and win the game. If Player A takes r < F_{m-1} matches, we note: [ F_{m+1} = F_m + F_{m-1} ] We can assume the initial pile of F_{m+1} matches is split into two piles: one with F_m and the other with F_{m-1}. Player A takes r matches from the smaller pile of F_{m-1}. By our inductive hypothesis, Player B can assure themselves the last match from the F_{m-1} pile, leaving the other pile with F_m. Using the same reasoning and applying the hypothesis repeatedly, Player B wins by ensuring they can always take the last match from each successive pile. This completes the induction step and proves (1). Proof of (2): If n > 1 is not any term of {F_k}, then Player A has a winning strategy. - When n = 4, it's straightforward to verify that Player A wins by taking 1 stick and following optimal moves. Suppose n geq 6 is not a Fibonacci number. There exists a Fibonacci number F_{k_0} such that: [ F_{k_0} < n < F_{k_0+1} ] and thus we have: [ n - F_{k_0} < F_{k_0+1} - F_{k_0} = F_{k_0-1} ] If n - F_{k_0} is a Fibonacci number F_{k_1}: [ n = F_{k_0} + F_{k_1}, quad text{where} k_0 - k_1 geq 2 ] If n - F_{k_0} is not a Fibonacci number, then there exists a smaller Fibonacci number F_{k_1} such that: [ F_{k_1} < n - F_{k_0} < F_{k_1+1} ] leading to: [ n - F_{k_0} - F_{k_1} < F_{k_1+1} - F_{k_1} = F_{k1-1} ] Repeating the same logic, we can express n in the form of: [ n = F_{k_0} + F_{k_1} + F_{k_2} + cdots + F_{k_i}, quad text{where} k_{i-1} - k_i geq 2, quad i = 0, 1, ldots, t-1 quad text{and} t geq 1 ] Player A starts by taking F_{k_t} matches: [ 2F_{k_t} < F_{k_t} + F_{k_t+1} = F_{k_t+2} leq F_{k_{t-1}} ] Hence, Player B cannot avoid the strategy where Player A eventually takes the last match in each successive split, securing that Player A wins the game. Thus, Player A wins if n is not a Fibonacci number, completing proof (2). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"find the value of 72519 x 9999 = m ?","completion":"To find the value of 72519 x 9999, you can use the multiplication method or a shortcut since 9999 is one less than 10000.

Since DC has length CD = AB = 8 units (since ABCD is a rectangle) and DF and GC have lengths of 2 and 3 units respectively, the length of FG is 8 - (2 + 3) = 3 units.

We call such a function a \\"good function.\\" 3. **Base case for induction:** For ( n = 1 ), we can define ( f(0) = 1 ) and ( f(1) = 0 ). Clearly, ( f(f(t)) = t ) and ( t + f(t) = 1 ) which is ( 2^0 ), a power of 2. 4. **Inductive step:** Assume that for all ( m leq n-1 ), there exists a good function. We need to construct ( f ) for ( [0, n] ). Let ( 2^a ) be the smallest power of 2 greater than ( n ), i.e., ( 2^{a-1} leq n < 2^a ). 5. **Define ( f ) for larger values:** For ( 2^a - n leq t leq n ), let ( f(t) = 2^a - t ).

We let ( f(t) = g(t) ) for ( t < 2^a - n ). 7. **Main proof using the good function:** We prove a more general statement: for any set of integers ( S ) (with ( |S| geq 1 )) subject to a good function, if ( A, B subseteq S ) and ( |A| + |B| geq |S| + 1 ), then there must exist ( a in A ) and ( b in B ) such that ( a + b ) is a power of 2. 8. **Base case for the main proof:** For ( |S| = 1 ), both ( A ) and ( B ) must equal ( S ). Since the unique element ( s in S ) has the property ( f(s) = s ), we have ( s + s = 2s ), which is a power of 2 if ( s = 0 ). 9. **Inductive step for the main proof:** Assume the claim holds for ( |S| leq n ). Suppose there exists a set ( S ) with ( |S| = n + 1 ) and ( A, B subseteq S ) such that there do not exist ( a in A ) and ( b in B ) with ( a + b ) a power of 2. Given ( |A| + |B| geq n + 2 ), there must be an element in ( A cap B ). Let this element be ( e_1 ). 10. **Contradiction:** Since ( f(e_1) ) cannot be in either ( A ) or ( B ), we have ( A, B subseteq S setminus {f(e_1)} ). Define ( A_1 = A setminus {e_1} ) and ( B_1 = B setminus {e_1} ). We have ( A_1, B_1 subseteq S setminus {e_1, f(e_1)} ).

This is due to the properties of symmetry and equal distances in an ellipse. 2. **Ellipse Definition and Perimeter Calculation**: Let |PF_{1}|=m and |PF_{2}|=n.

Let's call the percentage discount \\"D\\". The relationship between the list price, the discount, and the selling price is: Selling price = List price - (List price * D) We know the selling price (59.375) and the list price (67.47), so we can solve for D: 59.375 = 67.47 - (67.47 * D) Now, let's isolate D: 67.47 * D = 67.47 - 59.375 67.47 * D = 8.095 D = 8.095 / 67.47 D ≈ 0.12 To express D as a percentage, we multiply by 100: D ≈ 0.12 * 100 D ≈ 12% Therefore, the percentage deducted from the list price is approximately boxed{12%} ."},{"prompt":"a certain class, there are some students.

Therefore, multiplying by sqrt{2}, the range of y becomes [-sqrt{2}, sqrt{2}]. Hence, option A is correct. **B: The graph of this function is symmetric about the origin** To check for symmetry about the origin, we evaluate f(0) = sqrt{2}sin(0 + frac{pi}{4}) = sqrt{2}sin(frac{pi}{4}) = 1. Since f(0) neq 0, the function is not symmetric about the origin.

Since the function does not exhibit the necessary characteristics for symmetry about x = frac{3}{4}pi, option C is incorrect. **D: The function is periodic, and the smallest positive period is 2pi** Given y = sqrt{2}sin(x + frac{pi}{4}), we recognize that the sine function has a period of 2pi.

Subtract the second equation from the first equation: [ D_1 - D_2 = m^2 - n^2 = (a^2 - 4b) - (a^2 - 4(b+1)) = 4 ] Thus, [ m^2 - n^2 = 4 ] which factors as: [ (m - n)(m + n) = 4 ] 3. The only pairs of integers that multiply to 4 and have the same parity (both even or both odd) are: [ (m-n, m+n) = (2, 2) ] This implies: [ m - n = 2 quad text{and} quad m + n = 2 ] 4. Solving this system of equations gives: [ m = 2 quad text{and} quad n = 0 ] Thus, we have: [ D_1 = 2^2 = 4 quad text{and} quad D_2 = 0^2 = 0 ] Now to find the discriminant of x^2 + ax + b + 2: [ D_3 = a^2 - 4(b+2) ] Using the original relation, we know that: [ a^2 - 4b = 4 ] Therefore, [ D_3 = a^2 - 4(b+2) = (a^2 - 4b) - 8 = 4 - 8 = -4 ] Since the discriminant D_3 is negative (-4), the quadratic equation x^2 + ax + b + 2 has no real roots, hence no integer roots. Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The polynomial } x^2 + ax + b + 2 text{ has no integer roots.}} ] **Second Solution:** 1. By Vieta's formulas, the quadratics x^2 + ax + b and x^2 + ax + b + 1 have integer roots, so the coefficients a and b must be integers. 2. Let x_1 and x_2 be the roots of x^2 + ax + b, and let x_0 be a root of x^2 + ax + b + 1. Since the roots of P_1(x) = x^2 + ax + b and P_2(x) = x^2 + ax + b + 1 are integers, P_2(x) must differ from P_1(x) by 1: [ P_1(x_0) = -1 ] Therefore, [ P_1(x_1) - P_1(x_0) = 1 rightarrow (x_1 - x_0)(x_1 + x_0 + a) = 1 ] 3. Since (x_1 - x_0)(x_1 + x_0 + a) = 1 and both factors are integers: [ x_1 - x_0 = pm 1 quad text{and} quad x_1 + x_0 + a = pm 1 ] 4. Similarly, [ x_2 - x_0 = pm 1 quad text{and} quad x_2 + x_0 + a = pm 1 ] 5. Given x_1 neq x_2, it follows: [ |x_2 - x_1| = 2 quad text{and} quad x_0 = frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} ] 6. This reasoning holds for any root x_0 of P_2(x). The roots of P_2(x) coincide, hence: [ P_2(x) = (x - x_0)^2 ] 7. Thus, the polynomial: [ P_2(x) + 1 = (x - x_0)^2 + 1 > 0 quad text{for all } x ] Hence, P_2(x) + 1, which corresponds to P_3(x), has no zeros.

This sequence can be simplified by using the property of logarithms that states log(a/b) = log(a) - log(b). When we expand the sequence, we get: (log(3) - log(2)) * (log(4) - log(3)) * (log(5) - log(4)) * ... * (log(64) - log(63)) Now, let's look at the pattern.

The only terms that do not get canceled are log(2) and log(64), because log(2) does not appear as a positive term and log(64) does not appear as a negative term.

(27th Annual William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, 1966)","completion":"Consider an increasing sequence of (m n + 1) positive integers (a_1, a_2, cdots, a_{m n + 1}) such that [ 0 < a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_{m n + 1}. ] We aim to show that there exist either (m + 1) numbers in this sequence such that none of them can divide any other, or there exist (n + 1) numbers such that, when arranged in increasing order, every number except the first divides the previous one. Define the function (A(i)) as the length of the longest sequence starting from (a_i) where each subsequent number divides the previous one. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Initialization and Definitions:** Define (A(i)) for each (i) where (1 leq i leq m n + 1). (A(i)) represents the length of the longest chain starting at (a_i) where each number divides the next one in the chain. 2. **Finding Longest Chain of Divisors:** If there exists an (i) such that: [ A(i) geqslant n + 1, ] then we have found a subsequence of length at least (n + 1). This subsequence would satisfy the requirement as each number except the first one in this subsequence divides the previous number. 3. **Handling the Case when Longest Chain is Short:** If for all (i): [ A(i) leqslant n, ] then (A(1), A(2), cdots, A(m n + 1)) can only take values (1, 2, ldots, n). Thus, the function (A(i)) forms (n) different values. With (m n + 1) numbers, and (n) possible values of (A(i)), by the pigeonhole principle, at least one value among them must be repeated at least (m + 1) times. 4. **Conclusion and Contradiction:** Let these values be (a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, ldots, a_{i_{m+1}}) such that all these values have the same (A) value: [ A(i_1) = A(i_2) = cdots = A(i_{m+1}) = k. ] Since these (m + 1) numbers cannot all form a divisor chain (otherwise we would contradict the assumption), we ensure that none of the (m + 1) integers can divide another, fulfilling the requirement of the condition. Hence, there either exist (m + 1) numbers such that none of them divides another, or a subsequence of (n + 1) numbers where each divides the one that follows it, fulfilling the conditions of the problem effectively.

There are a finite number of such pairings. 3. **Minimal Sum of Distances**: Among all the possible pairings, select the one where the sum of the lengths of the ( n ) line segments is minimal.

We can apply the triangle inequality in this convex quadrilateral. 4. **Inequality**: - Given the convex quadrilateral ( K_1C_1K_2C_2 ), the sum of its diagonals will always be greater than the sum of the sides connecting the opposite vertices: [ K_1C_1 + K_2C_2 > K_1C_2 + K_2C_1 ] 5. **Contradiction**: - Now, considering our minimal pairing, if ( K_1C_1 ) and ( K_2C_2 ) intersect, we could replace these diagonals with ( K_1C_2 ) and ( K_2C_1 ), which would result in a smaller sum of distances. - This directly contradicts the assumption that our original pairing had the minimal sum of distances. 6. **Conclusion**: Hence, in the minimal pairing solution, no two line segments intersect.

The atomic weights of the elements are approximately: - Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol - Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol - Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol First, let's calculate the mass of the Carbon and Oxygen atoms in the compound: - Mass of Carbon atoms = 7 atoms * 12.01 g/mol = 84.07 g/mol - Mass of Oxygen atoms = 2 atoms * 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol Now, let's add the mass of Carbon and Oxygen atoms to find the total mass of these elements in the compound: - Total mass of C and O = 84.07 g/mol + 32.00 g/mol = 116.07 g/mol Next, we subtract this total mass from the molecular weight of the compound to find the mass of the Hydrogen atoms: - Mass of Hydrogen atoms = Molecular weight - Total mass of C and O - Mass of Hydrogen atoms = 122 g/mol - 116.07 g/mol = 5.93 g/mol Finally, we divide the mass of Hydrogen atoms by the atomic weight of Hydrogen to find the number of Hydrogen atoms: - Number of Hydrogen atoms = Mass of Hydrogen atoms / Atomic weight of Hydrogen - Number of Hydrogen atoms = 5.93 g/mol / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 5.88 Since the number of atoms must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number.

From the divisibility condition, we have (a+b)^2 mid 9a, since (a+b)^2 divides itself and thus should divide the difference 10a + b - (a + b) = 9a.

Specifically, each additional diagonal increases the number of regions (polygons) by 1. Therefore, if we have drawn k non-intersecting diagonals, the n-gon will be subdivided into k+1 regions. 2. **Analyzing Total Sides**: Let's count the total number of sides of all these regions. The original n-gon has n sides. Each diagonal is shared by two regions, so the total number of sides contributed by the k diagonals is 2k. Therefore, the total number of sides in all regions is: [ n + 2k ] Each of the resulting k+1 polygonal regions must have at least 3 sides (since the minimal polygon is a triangle), giving us the inequality: [ n + 2k geq 3(k + 1) ] 3. **Solving the Inequality**: Simplifying the inequality: [ n + 2k geq 3k + 3 ] [ n geq k + 3 ] [ k leq n - 3 ] Therefore, the maximum number of non-intersecting diagonals that can be drawn is n - 3. 4. **Verification by an Example**: To ensure this result is correct, consider drawing all diagonals from one vertex of an n-gon.

If he chooses the larger part (b) and splits it into (1) and (b-1), after further divisions he could potentially maximize his number of nuts. - Example: Let’s say Petya divides into (a = n) and (b = n + 1). Kolya then could split (b) into (1) and (n). - Thus, he might end up with at least (n + 1) nuts because he can always secure the largest split. **Method 2**: - Kolya picks the two middle parts after both parts (a) and (b) are divided. - Example: With Petya’s first division remaining as (a = 2) and (b = 2n - 1). - Then, Kolya chooses the best options, one from each part, which ideally leaves him with (n) nuts (in a balanced division). **Method 3**: - Kolya has two strategies: picking the largest and smallest parts or the two middle parts, but loses one nut when he employs his right to choose. - Example: The impact of losing one nut makes him end up with slightly less than what Method 1 offers, hence, he might actually end up with around (n) nuts. 4. **Conclusion**: - **Method 1**: Kolya secures at least (n + 1) nuts because he maximizes his parts by securing the highest amount. - **Method 2**: Kolya secures exactly (n) nuts. - **Method 3**: Despite giving one nut to Petya for the right to choose, Kolya cannot ensure more than (n + 1) nuts efficiently. Therefore, the most beneficial method for Kolya is **Method 1**, where he gets at least (n + 1) nuts.

For 16 pieces, consider using methods that appropriately balance these principles. **Step 3:** Visualize the circle divided into four larger equal segments using two straight cuts across the diameter vertically and horizontally: - These lines divide the circle into 4 equal quarters. Each quarter is a 90-degree sector. **Step 4:** Now focus on each of these quarters, as each quarter needs to be divided into 4 equal pieces (since 4 quarters multiplied by 4 pieces per quarter makes the total 16 pieces). **Step 5:** Divide each quarter using three additional cuts. These cuts should be such that each 90-degree sector is divided into 22.5-degree sectors: - Imagine each quarter being divided by lines that radiate from the center at an angle of 22.5 degrees relative to each other. Therefore, the key angles used for cuts from the center (in degrees) are: ( 22.5^circ, 45^circ, 67.5^circ,..., 360^circ ). **Step 6:** Start by verifying each piece's consistency in size and shape: - By using both vertical and horizontal lines and following up with additional lines radiating at equal angular distances in each quarter, ensure all 16 pieces are equivalent in both their area and shape.

The fly has a speed of 50 meters per second, while each of the spiders has a speed of r meters per second. The spiders choose their starting positions, and choose the fly's starting position, with the requirement that the fly must begin at a vertex. Each bug knows the position of each other bug at all times, and the goal of the spiders is for at least one of them to catch the fly. What is the maximum c so that for any r<c, the fly can always avoid being caught? *Author: Anderson Wang*","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** - We have a regular octahedron with a fly and three spiders. - The fly moves at (50) meters per second. - Each spider moves at (r) meters per second. - The spiders aim to catch the fly, and the fly aims to avoid being caught. - We need to find the maximum value of (c) such that for any (r < c), the fly can always avoid being caught. 2. **Analyzing the Fly's Movement:** - The fly starts at a vertex of the octahedron. - The fly can move to any of the four adjacent vertices. - The time taken for the fly to move to an adjacent vertex is (frac{d}{50}), where (d) is the distance between adjacent vertices. 3. **Analyzing the Spiders' Movement:** - Each spider can move at (r) meters per second. - In the same time (frac{d}{50}) that the fly moves to an adjacent vertex, a spider can move (r cdot frac{d}{50}) meters. 4. **Considering the Spiders' Strategy:** - If (r < 25), then in the time it takes the fly to move to an adjacent vertex, a spider can move less than half the distance between two adjacent vertices. - This means that a spider cannot block the fly from moving to an adjacent vertex because it cannot reach the vertex in time. 5. **Ensuring the Fly's Escape:** - Since there are only three spiders and each spider can block at most one vertex or one edge, there will always be at least one vertex that the fly can move to. - Therefore, the fly can always find a way to move to an unblocked vertex and continue escaping. 6. **Considering (r geq 25):** - If (r geq 25), then a spider can move at least half the distance between two adjacent vertices in the same time the fly moves to an adjacent vertex. - Two spiders can position themselves at the midpoints of opposite edges, effectively blocking the fly's movement. - The third spider can then move to catch the fly. 7. **Conclusion:** - The maximum value of (c) such that the fly can always avoid being caught is (25).

Let the equation of line MN be: x=ty+m, with points M(x_{1},y_{1}) and N(x_{2},y_{2}). The intersection of line MN and the x-axis is point D(m,0). Substituting x=ty+m into y^{2}=2x, we get y^{2}-2ty-2m=0. According to Vieta's theorem, we have y_{1} cdot y_{2}=-2m. Given that overrightarrow{OM}cdot overrightarrow{ON}=3, we have x_{1} cdot x_{2}+y_{1} cdot y_{2}=3, which leads to frac {1}{4}(y_{1} cdot y_{2})^{2}+y_{1} cdot y_{2}-3=0.

We can calculate this distance using the distance formula. When solving this type of problem, it is common to combine the equation of the line and the parabola, eliminate x or y to form a quadratic equation, use Vieta's theorem and given conditions to eliminate variables, and then find the maximum distance from the point to the line."},{"prompt":"Each of the numbers ( x, y, ) and ( z ) is between 0 and 1 inclusive.

This gives us (x^2+y^2 = (2sqrt{2})^2 = 8), which indicates that the circle has a center at the origin (0,0) and a radius of 2sqrt{2}. The line with parameters can be represented in general form as (x + y - 2 = 0) by setting (x = 1 + t) and (y = 1 - t), then eliminating the parameter t. To find the distance D from any point (x,y) on the circle to the line x + y - 2 = 0, we use the point-to-line distance formula: D = frac{|ax + by + c|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}, where (a, b, c) are the coefficients from the line's equation ax + by + c = 0. In our case, we have: D = frac{|x + y - 2|}{sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}} = frac{|2sqrt{2}costheta + 2sqrt{2}sintheta - 2|}{sqrt{2}}. The maximum distance occurs either when the circle is closest to or furthest away from the line. The closest distance coincides with the center of the circle, which is the origin (0,0), giving a minimum distance from the line of frac{|-2|}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}. The furthest distance will occur when the point is on the circle and directly opposite the closest point to the line, which implies that the points lie on a straight line passing through the circle's center and perpendicular to the given line. At this point, the distance formula will yield: D_{max} = frac{|2sqrt{2}costheta + 2sqrt{2}sintheta - 2|}{sqrt{2}}. Substituting the coefficients and simplifying gives: D_{max} = frac{|2sqrt{2}(costheta + sintheta) - 2|}{sqrt{2}}. To maximize D_{max}, we want to maximize the expression costheta + sintheta. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or by noting that costheta + sintheta = sqrt{2}sin(theta + frac{pi}{4}), we see that the maximum value of costheta + sintheta is sqrt{2}. Hence, the maximum value of D_{max} is: D_{max} = frac{|2sqrt{2}sqrt{2} - 2|}{sqrt{2}} = frac{|4 - 2|}{sqrt{2}} = frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}. However, we must remember to add the radius of the circle to this maximum distance, since the distance formula gives the distance from the given line to the center of the circle, not to a point on the circumference: D_{total} = 2sqrt{2} + sqrt{2} = 3sqrt{2}. Therefore, the maximum distance from a point on the circle to the given line is (boxed{3sqrt{2}})."},{"prompt":"a group of 8 persons, the average weight increases by 1.5 kg when a person with a certain weight is replaced by a new person who weighs 77 kg.

Assume that ( C_{1}, C_{2}, ) and ( C_{3} ) are the solution. We need to show that no other solution exists. 2. **Uniqueness of the Solution:** Suppose there exist points ( C_{1}', C_{2}', C_{3}' ) that also meet the requirement. Assume ( C_{3}' neq C_{3} ). Let ( C_{3}' ) be an internal point on ( C_{3}B_{1} ). Since ( A_{3}, C_{3}', C_{1}' ) are collinear, ( C_{1}' ) lies inside ( C_{1}B_{3} ).

Next, let's analyze set B: The inequality (x-m)(x-2)<0 implies that x is between m and 2 (assuming m<2), which means the solution for B is m<x<2.

It is known that on the cards of one color, pairwise sums of some three numbers are written, and on the cards of the other color, the pairwise products of the same three numbers are written. Can these three numbers always be determined?","completion":"Given the problem statement, we have three red cards and three blue cards on which six distinct positive numbers are written. The numbers on one set of cards (either red or blue) are pairwise sums of three numbers, while the numbers on the other set are pairwise products of the same three numbers. We aim to determine whether it is always possible to uniquely find these three numbers. 1. Let the three unknown numbers be denoted as (x < y < z). 2. Assume the three red cards (WLOG) have the pairwise sums written on them: (x + y), (x + z), and (y + z). 3. The three blue cards will thus have the pairwise products: (xy), (xz), and (yz). First, we recognize: - Pairwise sums are always distinct and positive. - Pairwise products are also always distinct and positive since the numbers (x, y, z) are distinct and positive. Given these constraints, we can systemically solve for (x, y, z): **Method 1: Solving from Pairwise Sums and Products** 4. From the pairwise sums, a straightforward calculation gives us: [ x + y = a ] [ x + z = b ] [ y + z = c ] Where (a < b < c). Solving these equations, we get: [ x = frac{(x+y) + (x+z) - (y+z)}{2} = frac{a + b - c}{2} ] [ y = frac{(x+y) + (y+z) - (x+z)}{2} = frac{a + c - b}{2} ] [ z = frac{(x+z) + (y+z) - (x+y)}{2} = frac{b + c - a}{2} ] 5. Similarly, knowing (xy, xz,) and (yz), use: [ xy = p ] [ xz = q ] [ yz = r ] 6. Notice that the product solution is fully constrained as well: [ xyz = sqrt{(xy)(xz)(yz)} = sqrt{pqr} = V ] Hence, solving for each variable, we need to match them using the roots: [ x = sqrt{frac{p}{r}} ] [ y = sqrt{frac{r}{q}} ] [ z = sqrt{frac{q}{p}} ] 7. Using both the sum and product methods, we can uniquely identify each number (x, y, z). **Method 2: Evaluating the Relationships Between Sums and Products** 8. Since ( x < y < z ): [ x + y < x + z < y + z ] [ xy < xz < yz ] Identify numbers on cards (a < b < c) for sums and (p < q < r) for products. We match these inequalities with given sums and products. 9. Verify consistency by checking computations of one card set from the other using identified values and solve for each variable directly. **Conclusion:** Given the problem formulation and solution structure, there is a unique way to determine the three numbers based on their pairwise sums and products. # Conclusion [ boxed{text{Yes, it is always possible to determine the three numbers uniquely.}} ]"},{"prompt":"w many positive integers, not exceeding 200, are multiples of 3 or 5 but not 6?","completion":"1. **Count the multiples of 3 and 5 up to 200**: - Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, ldots, 198.

Type O blood can be donated to any blood type because it is the universal donor, and Type A blood can be donated to both Type A and AB blood types. Therefore, the compatible blood types for our Type A patient are Type O and Type A. From the given data: - Probability of selecting a person with Type O blood (P(O)) = 50% or 0.50 - Probability of selecting a person with Type A blood (P(A)) = 15% or 0.15 Since selecting a person with Type O or Type A blood are mutually exclusive events, the probability of selecting a person who can donate blood to the patient is given by the sum of the probabilities of these two events. Using the addition rule for mutually exclusive events, the desired probability is: P(text{O or A}) = P(O) + P(A) Substitute the given probabilities: P(text{O or A}) = 0.50 + 0.15 = 0.65 Converting this probability back to a percentage: P(text{O or A}) = 65% Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected person can donate blood to the A-type patient is boxed{65%}."},{"prompt":"and b can do a piece of work in 2 days , b and c in 3 days , c and a in 4 days . how long will c take to do it ?","completion":"Let's denote the work rates of a, b, and c as A, B, and C respectively, where these rates are in units of work per day.

Taking the limit as (l to infty): [ lim_{l to infty} frac{left(frac{c}{2^l}right)^{2^{l+1}}}{16^{2^{l-1}}} = 0 ] for any constant (c). This implies: [ 0 geq a_{2016} ] Combining this with (a_{2016} geq 0), we get: [ a_{2016} = 0 ] 8. Since (a_{2016} = 0) and (b_{2016} = 1), we have (a_n b_n = 0) for all (n in mathbb{Z}^+).

We need to find all *good* (n)-tuples ((a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n)) such that (sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = 2n) and no subset of (a_i)'s sums to (n). 2. **Sum Constraints and Modulo Analysis:** Consider the partial sums (a_1, a_1 + a_2, ldots, a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{n-1}). These sums are all between (0) and (2n) exclusive. If any of these sums is congruent to (0 pmod{n}), it would equal (n), which contradicts the condition that no subset sums to (n). Additionally, if any two partial sums are congruent modulo (n), their difference would also be a sum of some (a_i)'s and would equal (n), another contradiction. Therefore, all these sums must be distinct and nonzero modulo (n). 3. **Induction Hypothesis:** We use strong induction to show that (a_1 equiv a_2 equiv cdots equiv a_n pmod{n}). For the base case, consider (a_2 equiv a_1 + cdots + a_k pmod{n}) for some (1 leq k leq n). If (k geq 2), we get a contradiction. Thus, (k = 1). 4. **Inductive Step:** Assume (a_1 equiv a_2 equiv cdots equiv a_k pmod{n}) for (1 leq k < n). Consider the sum (a_2 + cdots + a_{k+1} equiv a_1 + cdots + a_{k-1} + a_{k+1} pmod{n}). If (i leq k-1), we get a contradiction. If (i geq k+2), we get another contradiction. If (i = k+1), then from the previous step, we have (a_k equiv 0 pmod{n}). So, (i = k), and we conclude (a_{k+1} equiv a_1 pmod{n}). Therefore, (a_1 equiv cdots equiv a_n pmod{n}). 5. **Form of (a_i):** We can write (a_1 = k_1 times n + r, ldots, a_n = k_n times n + r) where (0 < r < n).

By marking these intersection points, Fedya can proceed to draw new lines through any pairs of intersection points. 3. **Constructing Parallel Lines**: - Similarly, Fedya can construct lines parallel to a given line. By constructing perpendicular lines to a given line multiple times, Fedya can accumulate a set of parallel lines by using the previously obtained perpendicular line as a reference. 4. **Achieving Sufficient Construction Points**: - By iterating the previous steps, Fedya can create numerous parallel and perpendicular lines to any line segment of the triangle. This is critical since parallel and perpendicular constructs form the basis for further geometric constructions. 5. **Marking Symmetric Points**: - Once Fedya has constructed enough lines, intersections of parallel lines, or circles, he can mark points symmetric to known points relative to a line (side of triangle). Given points (A_i, B_i) on the side (AC) or (BC), he can systematically plot them by noting intersections and constructing necessary perpendicular bisectors. 6. **Constructing the Altitudes**: - Using the symmetric properties and the intersections created previously, Fedya can draw altitudes of the triangle. An altitude in a triangle is a perpendicular from a vertex to the opposite side (or its extension). With the set of perpendicular and parallel lines at his disposal, Fedya can construct the necessary altitudes by leveraging the already marked symmetric points which lie on perpendiculars from each vertex. After following these detailed construction steps, it is affirmed that Fedya can indeed proceed to mark and construct the necessary altitudes of the triangle despite Vanya's interruptions. This iterative procedural ability, along with redundancy in marking points and construction of intersections, ensures that eventually enough marked points will remain to draw the needed altitudes. # Conclusion: Therefore, Fedya can successfully construct the altitudes of the given triangle. boxed{text{Yes}} \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries.

The area of triangle TAB (which is a right triangle) can be calculated as: [ text{Area}_{TAB} = frac{1}{2} cdot TA cdot TB = frac{1}{2} cdot 12 cdot 12 = 72 text{ square units}. ] The volume of the pyramid TABC can then be calculated using the formula for the volume of a pyramid, frac{1}{3} cdot text{Base Area} cdot text{Height}, which gives us: [ V_{TABC} = frac{1}{3} cdot 72 cdot 6 = 144 text{ cubic units}. ] 2. **Expressing Volume of TABC Using Distance h from T to Face ABC:** Let h be the distance from T to face ABC.

Equating this to the previously found volume, we have: [ frac{1}{3} cdot h cdot text{Area}_{ABC} = 144. ] Solving for h gives us: [ h = frac{432}{text{Area}_{ABC}}. ] 3. **Finding the Area of Triangle ABC:** To find text{Area}_{ABC}, we first determine the lengths of the sides of triangle ABC using the Pythagorean Theorem in triangles TAB, TAC, and TBC: - For AB, we have AB = 12sqrt{2}. - For AC and BC, we find AC = BC = sqrt{12^2 + 6^2} = 6sqrt{5}. Knowing that triangle ABC is isosceles with AC = BC, we calculate the altitude CM by bisecting AB and applying the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle ACM: - AM = 6sqrt{2}, leading to CM = 6sqrt{3}.

This is because the vector condition implies a scaling factor between corresponding sides of the triangles. 2. **Let |F_{1}F_{2}|=2c**, which is a standard notation for the distance between the foci of a hyperbola. Given this, we can deduce that **|F_{2}C|=4c** due to the similarity and scaling factor between the triangles. 3. **If we let |AF_{1}|=t**, then by the properties of similar triangles and the given vector relationship, **|BF_{1}|=3t** and consequently, **|AB|=2t**. 4. **Given that BF_{2} bisects angle F_{1}BC**, by the angle bisector theorem, we have: [ frac{|BF_1|}{|BC|}=frac{|F_1F_2|}{|F_2C|}=frac{2c}{4c}=frac{1}{2} ] This implies that **|BC|=2|BF_{1}|=6t**, and therefore, **|AF_2|=frac{1}{3}|BC|=2t**. 5. **According to the definition of a hyperbola**, the difference in distances from any point on the hyperbola to the foci is constant and equal to 2a. Thus, from **|AF_{2}|-|AF_{1}|=2a**, we get **2t-t=2a**, leading to **t=2a**. 6. Also, from **|BF_{1}|-|BF_{2}|=2a**, we find that **|BF_{2}|=3t-2a=2t**. This implies that **|BF_{2}|=|AB|=|AF_{2}|=2t**, showing that triangle ABF_{2} is an equilateral triangle, and hence, **angle F_{2}BC=angle ABF_{2}=60^{circ}**. 7. In triangle F_{1}BF_{2}, applying the law of cosines to angle F_1BF_2, we have: [ cosangle F_1BF_2=frac{|BF_1|^2+|BF_2|^2-|F_1F_2|^2}{2cdot|BF_1|cdot|BF_2|}=frac{4t^2+9t^2-4c^2}{2cdot2tcdot3t}=frac{1}{2} ] Simplifying this equation gives us **7t^{2}=4c^{2}**. 8. Substituting **t=2a** (from step 5) into the equation **7t^{2}=4c^{2}**, we find the relationship between c and a, which defines the eccentricity e of the hyperbola as **e=frac{c}{a}=sqrt{7}**. Therefore, the eccentricity of the hyperbola Gamma is boxed{sqrt{7}}.

If both were greater than ( sqrt{n} ), then their product would be: [ a cdot frac{n}{a} = n > sqrt{n} cdot sqrt{n} = n ] This would lead to a contradiction because it would imply ( n > n ), which is impossible. 5. **Conclusion of Divisor Bound:** Therefore, this contradiction implies that the assumption that both ( a ) and ( frac{n}{a} ) are greater than ( sqrt{n} ) is false.

Sie fand zwischen April und August 1944 im Verlauf der alliierten Landung in Nordfrankreich (→ Operation Overlord) statt., Die alliierte Landung in der Normandie wurde auch durch die Luftüberlegenheit der alliierten Streitkräfte ermöglicht. Vor dem 6. Juni 1944, dem sogenannten D-Day, bereiteten die alliierten Luftstreitkräfte die Invasion vor. Sie bombardierten deutsche Versorgungslinien, Artilleriebatterien und unterstützten die französische Résistance aus der Luft mit Munition und Ausrüstung., Während des D-Days sicherten alliierte Jäger den Luftraum über dem Landungsbereich, und Bomberstaffeln griffen deutsche Stellungen im Hinterland an. Zum Schutz der Armada und der Nachschubschiffe suchten zugleich alliierte Flugzeuge die See nach deutschen U-Booten ab. Da die Deutschen an eine Landung an der Straße von Calais geglaubt hatten und teilweise im Juni 1944 immer noch glaubten (→ Deutsche Situation in der Normandie im Jahr 1944), konnten sie den Alliierten am D-Day nur wenige Jagdflugzeuge entgegensetzen. Ein Großteil der Verbände war kurz zuvor weiter ins Landesinnere verlegt worden., Nach dem D-Day unterstützten die Alliierten ihre Offensiven auf dem Boden mit konzentrierten Bombardements. Alliierte Jagdbomber suchten die Normandie nach deutschen Truppenverbänden ab und beschossen sie, um einen Einsatz gegen die Landstreitkräfte zu verhindern. Die deutsche Luftwaffe konnte den alliierten Luftstreitkräften und dem Vormarsch am Boden kaum Kräfte entgegensetzen. Die deutsche Wehrmacht erhoffte sich durch „Wunderwaffen“, wie beispielsweise „Blitzbombern“ und Düsenjägern (die jedoch nicht zum Einsatz kamen), vor allem aber durch den Einsatz von kampferprobten Panzerdivisionen, die Invasion abzuwehren. Außerdem griff die deutsche Wehrmacht britische Städte mit den „Vergeltungswaffen“ V1 und V2 an., Die alliierten Luftstreitkräfte konnten alle an sie gestellten Aufgaben erfüllen, wenn auch, wie im Falle der Schlacht um Caen, mit Verzögerung aufgrund schlechten Wetters. Das Ausmaß der eingesetzten Kräfte war bislang unerreicht, der Verlust von fast 17.000 alliierten Besatzungen innerhalb von weniger als drei Monaten war das höchste personelle und materielle Opfer in der Geschichte des Luftkrieges. Die deutsche Luftwaffe war nicht in der Lage, der alliierten Übermacht entscheidend zu begegnen. Der Versuch, den alliierten Vormarsch durch einen massiven Gegenschlag während ungünstigen Flugwetters im Winter 1944 zu stoppen, scheiterte ebenfalls (Ardennenoffensive, Operation Bodenplatte)., Hintergrund, Planung und Situation der Kriegsgegner., Alliierte Vorbereitung der Operation Overlord und Aufgabenstellung für die Luftstreitkräfte., Am 11. Januar 1944 begannen die alliierten Luftangriffe im direkten Zusammenhang mit der Vorbereitung auf Operation Overlord. Die Einsätze hatten bis zum Beginn der Invasion folgende Ziele, die parallel zueinander verfolgt wurden:, Bereits vier Monate vor der Durchführung der Operation Overlord wurde von den Alliierten eine Serie von Luftangriffen gegen Ziele an der Kanalküste, der holländischen Küste und Ziele im Reichsgebiet durchgeführt, mitunter um die Verteidigungsbereitschaft der deutschen Luftwaffe zu testen. Bei diesen Operationen, die bei den alliierten Besatzungen als Big Week bekannt wurden, stellte sich heraus, dass die alliierten Luftstreitkräfte an jedem Ort und zu jeder Zeit die Luftherrschaft erringen konnten., Darüber hinaus wurden im April 1944 Erdöllager im Fördergebiet um die rumänische Stadt Ploesti und Hydrierwerke im deutschen Reichsgebiet angegriffen, was zu einem Mangel an Flugbenzin führte und die Bewegungsfreiheit der Luftwaffe weiter einschränkte., Beteiligte alliierte Luftstreitkräfte., Oberbefehlshaber der Alliierten Expeditions-Luftflotten (Allied Expeditionary Air Force, AEAF) und damit der größten und vielseitigsten Luftarmada aller Zeiten war Air Chief Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory. Unter seinem Befehl befanden sich Luftlandeflotten, Taktische Luftflotten, Strategische Luftflotten, das Küstenkommando der Royal Air Force sowie die „Air Defence of Great Britain“., Taktische Luftflotten., Entwicklungsgeschichte., Während des Westfeldzugs 1940 waren die Methoden der alliierten Luftstreitkräfte, insbesondere der Royal Air Force, gegen die schnell vorrückenden Verbände des deutschen Landheeres noch unbefriedigend. Die für die Luftnahunterstützung vorgesehenen Verbände, die mit veralteten Flugzeugen des Musters Fairey Battle ausgerüstet waren, konnten kaum taktische Erfolge erzielen und waren fast vollständig aufgerieben worden., Während des Afrikafeldzuges, der für Großbritannien eine Fortsetzung des Landkrieges gegen das Deutsche Reich darstellte, wurde dieses Defizit sowohl bei der RAF als auch bei den amerikanischen Luftstreitkräften aufgeholt. Die erste taktische Luftflotte der Royal Air Force war die Desert Air Force (DAF). Diese aus verschiedenen Jäger- und Bomberkommandos zusammengestellte Einheit entwickelte wichtige, für spätere taktische Luftflotten wegweisende Methoden wie zum Beispiel den Einsatz von Forward Air Controllern (zu deutsch sinngemäß: Vorgeschobene Angriffseinweiser)., Auf amerikanischer Seite wurde die 9th Air Force am 12. November 1942 aus der US-Army Middle East Air Force (USAMEAF) in Nordafrika gebildet. Vorhandene Flugzeugmuster wurden für den Einsatz gegen Bodentruppen in einer taktischen Situation umgerüstet, Angriffsmuster wurden erprobt, die Voraussetzungen für die Entstehung von spezialisierten taktischen Luftflotten wurden geschaffen., Die 2nd Tactical Air Force der Briten und die 9th Air Force der Amerikaner., Als das Afrikakorps 1943 geschlagen war, wurden die taktischen Einheiten nach England verlegt und in zwei große Luftflotten zusammengefasst, die britische Second Tactical Air Force (2nd TAF) und die amerikanische 9th Air Force., Beide Luftflotten wurden auf die Umstände einer geplanten Invasion hin ausgerichtet und begleiteten die alliierten Bodentruppen von der Landung in der Normandie an bis zum Kriegsende. Die Ausrüstung wurde im weiteren Verlauf durch neue Flugzeugmuster und spezielle Munition komplettiert, wie zum Beispiel die Hawker Typhoon, ausgerüstet mit ungelenkten Luft-Bodenraketen zur Panzerbekämpfung., Die 2nd Tactical Air Force und die 9th Air Force verfügten am 6. Juni 1944 zusammen über ca. 2.600 Flugzeuge, darunter Jagdflugzeuge, Jagdbomber, leichte und mittlere Bomber, Aufklärer und Artilleriebeobachter., Royal Air Force Coastal Command (Küstenkommando)., \\"16th\\" und \\"19th Group\\" mit insgesamt 63 Staffeln, die am 6. Juni zusammen 678 einsatzbereite Flugzeuge umfassten, davon 549 aus Einheiten der Royal Air Force. Hauptaufgabe war die Durchführung der Operation Cork. Daneben wurden die alliierten Seestreitkräfte bei der Abwehr von Schnellbooten und anderen leichten Überwasserschiffen unterstützt und Nachschublinien an der Küste angegriffen., Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB)., Zur Verteidigung der britischen Inseln waren die \\"10th\\", die \\"11th\\", die 12th und die \\"13th Group\\" mit insgesamt 45 Staffeln vorgesehen. Diese Einheiten wurden teilweise auch kurzfristig der 2nd Tactical Air Force unterstellt und nahmen an vielfältigen Operationen teil, die weit über die Verteidigung des britischen Luftraumes hinausgingen., Verteidigungsplan der deutschen Luftwaffe., Die Rolle der Luftwaffe., Nach dem Kriegswinter 1943/44 kam es zu einer Vertrauenskrise zwischen dem Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe Hermann Göring und Hitler. Göring, seit dem misslungenen Putsch 1923 engster Vertrauter Hitlers, hatte während des Krieges mehrfach leere Versprechungen gemacht. So wollte er 1940 das Britische Expeditionskorps in Dünkirchen durch die Luftwaffe vernichten, es gelang aber eine erfolgreiche Evakuierung von fast 340.000 alliierten Soldaten. Im August 1940 wollte er die Royal Air Force innerhalb von vier Tagen niederwerfen, scheiterte aber in der Luftschlacht um England auch damit. Die von ihm zugesagte Versorgung der eingeschlossenen 6. Armee in Stalingrad über den Winter 1942–43 aus der Luft versagte. Göring hatte sogar behauptet, das Reichsgebiet vor alliierten Luftangriffen vollständig schützen zu können., Die Hoffnung auf starke Landstreitkräfte und die kapitalen Fehleinschätzungen Görings führten dazu, dass Hitler die Verteidigung der möglichen Invasionsstrände nicht der Luftwaffe übertrug. Er wählte dafür mit Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel den Befehlshaber mit großen Erfahrungen im Bodenkampf gegen alliierte Truppen., Den Einsatz der Luftwaffe, insbesondere den Einsatz von „Blitzbombern“ zur Bekämpfung gelandeter alliierter Truppen, gedachte Hitler selbst zu lenken. Die tatsächliche Aktivität der Luftwaffe beschränkte sich im Rahmen des Unternehmens Steinbock auf einzelne Nachtangriffe, wie am 29. April 1944 gegen Portsmouth mit 100 Bombern. Zusammen mit dem V-Waffeneinsatz bildete dies die sogenannte Fernkampfoffensive., Abgeworfene Bombenlasten über England:, Die defensiven Vorkehrungen beschränkten sich auf die Verlegung von einigen Luftabwehrbatterien aus dem Reichsgebiet an die Atlantikküste. Mit der Verlegung von fliegenden Verbänden wollte man im Oberkommando der Wehrmacht „\\"bis zum letzten Augenblick [warten].\\"“, Die vom Oberkommando der Wehrmacht erwogenen Szenarien konzentrierten sich auf Feldschlachten gegen Luftlandetruppen und Heeresverbände der alliierten Invasionsarmee. Aspekte des Luftkrieges in diesem Zusammenhang wurden vernachlässigt. Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel, der die Verteidigungsanlagen der zukünftigen Westfront inspizierte, stellte fest, dass eine Invasionsarmee von den Verteidigern noch vor der Brückenkopfbildung zurückgeschlagen werden müsse. Rommel selbst konzentrierte sich dabei auf die Bereitstellung von gepanzerten Verbänden und den Ausbau von Verteidigungsanlagen. Wie der Luftüberlegenheit des Gegners zu begegnen sei, blieb offen., Ab April wurden die militärischen Voraussetzungen für eine Invasion auf alliierter Seite vom Oberkommando der Wehrmacht als gegeben betrachtet. Jede Verzögerung des Angriffs wurde als Vorteil für die Verteidiger gewertet, da diese die Zeit für die Aufstellung weiterer Heeresverbände und zum Ausbau von Verteidigungsanlagen nutzen könnten. Dass der Grund der Verzögerung möglicherweise mit der Flugwetterlage zu tun hatte, wurde zwar erkannt, es wurden aber keine Anstalten zur Sicherstellung der Luftüberlegenheit über den möglichen Kampfgebieten getroffen., Verfügbare Einheiten: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Sie hatte in Florenz ein herausragendes Zentrum und breitete sich im 15. und 16. Jahrhundert über den größten Teil Europas aus., In erster Linie war der Renaissance-Humanismus eine literarisch ausgerichtete Bildungsbewegung. Die Humanisten traten für eine umfassende Bildungsreform ein, von der sie eine optimale Entfaltung der menschlichen Fähigkeiten durch die Verbindung von Wissen und Tugend erhofften. Humanistische Bildung sollte den Menschen befähigen, seine wahre Bestimmung zu erkennen und durch Nachahmung klassischer Vorbilder ein ideales Menschentum zu verwirklichen. Ein wertvoller, wahrheitsgemäßer Inhalt und eine vollendete sprachliche Form bildeten für die Humanisten eine Einheit. Daher galt ihr besonderes Augenmerk der Pflege des sprachlichen Ausdrucks. Der Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaft fiel im humanistischen Bildungsprogramm eine zentrale Rolle zu. Im Mittelpunkt standen dabei die Dichtkunst und die Rhetorik., Ein prägendes Merkmal der humanistischen Bewegung war das Bewusstsein, einer neuen Epoche anzugehören, und das Bedürfnis, sich von der Vergangenheit der vorhergehenden Jahrhunderte abzugrenzen. Diese Vergangenheit, die man „Mittelalter“ zu nennen begann, wurde von maßgeblichen Vertretern der neuen Denkrichtung verächtlich abgelehnt. Insbesondere den spätmittelalterlichen scholastischen Lehrbetrieb hielten die Humanisten für verfehlt. Dem „barbarischen“ Zeitalter der „Finsternis“ stellten sie die Antike als schlechthin maßgebliche Norm für alle Lebensbereiche entgegen., Ein Hauptanliegen der humanistischen Gelehrten war die Gewinnung eines direkten Zugangs zu dieser Norm in ihrer ursprünglichen, unverfälschten Gestalt. Daraus ergab sich die Forderung nach Rückbesinnung auf die authentischen antiken Quellen, knapp ausgedrückt in dem lateinischen Schlagwort \\"ad fontes.\\" Als besonders verdienstlich galt das Aufspüren und Veröffentlichen verschollener Werke der antiken Literatur, das mit großem Engagement betrieben wurde und zu spektakulären Erfolgen führte. Mit der Auffindung vieler Textzeugen wurde die Kenntnis des Altertums dramatisch ausgeweitet. Die Früchte dieser Bemühungen konnten dank der Erfindung des Buchdrucks einer breiteren Öffentlichkeit zugänglich gemacht werden. Dadurch nahm der Einfluss des kulturellen Erbes der Antike auf zahlreiche Lebensbereiche der Gebildeten stark zu. Außerdem schufen die Renaissance-Humanisten mit der Entdeckung und Erschließung von Handschriften, Inschriften, Münzen und sonstigem Fundmaterial die Voraussetzungen und Grundlagen der Altertumswissenschaft. Neben der Pflege der Gelehrtensprachen Latein und Griechisch befassten sie sich auch mit der volkssprachlichen Literatur und gaben ihr bedeutende Impulse., Begriffsgeschichte., Der Begriff „Humanismus“ wurde von dem Philosophen und Bildungspolitiker Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer (1766–1848) eingeführt. Niethammers 1808 veröffentlichte pädagogische Kampfschrift \\"Der Streit des Philanthropinismus und Humanismus in der Theorie des Erziehungs-Unterrichts unsrer Zeit\\" erregte Aufsehen. Als Humanismus bezeichnete er die pädagogische Grundhaltung derjenigen, die den Unterrichtsstoff nicht unter dem Gesichtspunkt seiner praktischen, materiellen Verwertbarkeit beurteilen, sondern Bildung als Selbstzweck unabhängig von Nützlichkeitserwägungen anstreben. Dabei kommt der Erlangung sprachlicher und literarischer Kenntnisse und Fähigkeiten eine zentrale Rolle zu. Als entscheidender Faktor im Lernprozess gilt die Anregung durch das intensive Studium „klassischer“ Vorbilder, die man nachahmt. Dieses Bildungsideal war das traditionelle, seit der Renaissance allgemein herrschende. Daher begann man um die Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts, die Geistesbewegung, die in der Epoche der Renaissance das Programm einer so konzipierten Bildung formuliert und umgesetzt hatte, als Humanismus zu bezeichnen. Als kulturhistorischer Epochenbegriff für eine lange Zeit des Übergangs vom Spätmittelalter zur Frühen Neuzeit wurde „Humanismus“ von Georg Voigt in seinem 1859 erschienenen Werk \\"Die Wiederbelebung des classischen Alterthums oder das erste Jahrhundert des Humanismus\\" etabliert., Das Wort „Humanist“ ist erstmals gegen Ende des 15. Jahrhunderts bezeugt, und zwar zunächst als Berufsbezeichnung für Inhaber einschlägiger Lehrstühle, analog zu „Jurist“ oder „Kanonist“ (Kirchenrechtler). Erst im frühen 16. Jahrhundert wurde es auch für außeruniversitäre Gebildete verwendet, die sich als \\"humanistae\\" verstanden., Selbstverständnis und Ziele der Humanisten., Das Bildungsprogramm und seine literarische Grundlage., Ausgangspunkt der Bewegung war das Konzept der Humanität (lateinisch \\"humanitas\\" „Menschennatur“, „das Menschengemäße, den Menschen Auszeichnende“), das in der Antike von Cicero formuliert worden war. Auf die Ausformung der \\"humanitas\\" zielten die von Cicero als \\"studia humanitatis\\" bezeichneten Bildungsbestrebungen. In antiken Philosophenkreisen – besonders bei Cicero – wurde betont, dass der Mensch sich vom Tier durch die Sprache unterscheidet. Das bedeutet, dass er in der Erlernung und Pflege sprachlicher Kommunikation seine Menschlichkeit lebt und das spezifisch Menschliche hervortreten lässt. Daher war der Gedanke naheliegend, dass die Kultivierung der sprachlichen Ausdrucksfähigkeit den Menschen erst richtig zum Menschen macht, wobei sie ihn auch moralisch emporhebt und zum Philosophieren befähigt. Daraus konnte man folgern, dass Sprachgebrauch auf dem höchsten erreichbaren Niveau die grundlegendste und vornehmste Tätigkeit des Menschen sei. Aus dieser Überlegung entstand in der Frühen Neuzeit der Begriff \\"studia humaniora\\" („die mehr [als andere Fächer] menschengemäßen Studien“ oder „die zu höherem Menschentum führenden Studien“) zur Bezeichnung der Bildung im humanistischen Sinn., Aus dieser Sicht ergab sich die Würdigung der Sprache als Instrument des Selbstausdrucks der menschlichen Rationalität und der unbegrenzten Fähigkeit des Menschen, Bedeutungen zu vermitteln. Zugleich erschien die Sprache als das Medium, mit dem der Mensch seine Welt nicht nur erfährt, sondern auch konstituiert. Von solchen Gedankengängen ausgehend gelangten die Humanisten zur Annahme, dass zwischen der Qualität der sprachlichen Form und der Qualität des durch sie mitgeteilten Inhalts ein notwendiger Zusammenhang bestehe, insbesondere dass ein in schlechtem Stil geschriebener Text auch inhaltlich nicht ernst zu nehmen und sein Autor ein Barbar sei. Daher wurde am mittelalterlichen Latein heftige Kritik geübt, wobei ausschließlich die klassischen Vorbilder, vor allem Cicero, den Maßstab bildeten. Besonders die Fachsprache der Scholastik, die sich vom klassischen Latein weit entfernt hatte, wurde von den Humanisten verachtet und verspottet. Eines ihrer Hauptanliegen war die Reinigung der lateinischen Sprache von „barbarischen“ Verfälschungen und die Wiederherstellung ihrer ursprünglichen Schönheit. Sprachkunst \\"(eloquentia)\\" und Weisheit sollten eine Einheit bilden. Nach humanistischer Überzeugung gedeihen die Studien auf allen Gebieten, wenn die Sprache in Blüte steht, und sie verfallen in Zeiten des sprachlichen Niedergangs., Demgemäß wurde die Rhetorik als Kunst der sprachlichen Eleganz zur Zentraldisziplin aufgewertet. Auf diesem Gebiet war neben Cicero Quintilian für die Humanisten die maßgebliche Autorität. Eine Folge der gesteigerten Wertschätzung der Redekunst war die Rhetorisierung aller Formen der Kommunikation bis hin zu den Umgangsformen. Weil viele Wortführer der humanistischen Bewegung Rhetoriklehrer waren oder als Redner auftraten, nannte man die Humanisten oft auch einfach „Redner“ \\"(oratores).\\", Ein Problem stellte das Spannungsverhältnis der grundsätzlich positiv bewerteten Sprachkunst zum philosophischen oder theologischen Bemühen um Wahrheitsfindung dar. Es erhob sich die Frage, ob eine vorbehaltlose Bejahung der Beredsamkeit gerechtfertigt sei, obwohl rhetorische Brillanz zur Täuschung und Manipulation missbraucht werden kann. Der Einwand, Eloquenz sei zwangsläufig mit Lüge verbunden und die Wahrheit spreche auch ohne rednerischen Schmuck für sich, wurde von den Humanisten ernst genommen und kontrovers diskutiert. Die Rhetorikbefürworter gingen von der humanistischen Grundüberzeugung aus, Form und Inhalt seien nicht zu trennen, ein wertvoller Inhalt erfordere schöne Form. Sie glaubten, guter Stil sei ein Zeichen angemessenen Denkens und eine ungepflegte Ausdrucksweise sei auch unklar. Diese Einstellung dominierte, doch es gab auch Vertreter der Gegenthese, die meinten, die Philosophie bedürfe keiner Beredsamkeit und die Wahrheitssuche vollziehe sich in einem eloquenzfreien Bereich., Ihren Höhepunkt erreichte die Kultivierung der Sprache aus der Sicht der Humanisten in der Dichtkunst, die daher bei ihnen die höchste Wertschätzung genoss. Wie für die Prosa Cicero war für die Poesie Vergil das maßgebliche Vorbild. Als Krone der Dichtung wurde das Epos betrachtet, daher versuchten viele Humanisten das klassische Epos zu erneuern. Oft wurden die Epen von Herrschern in Auftrag gegeben und dienten deren Verherrlichung. Stark verbreitet war aber auch die Gelegenheitsdichtung, darunter Geburtstags-, Hochzeits- und Trauergedichte. Nördlich der Alpen waren poetische Reisebeschreibungen (Hodoeporica) beliebt. Vom Dichter erwartete man gemäß dem Ideal des \\"poeta doctus\\" das Sachwissen eines universal Gebildeten, das sowohl kultur- als auch naturwissenschaftliche und praktische Kenntnisse umfassen sollte. Sehr geschätzt wurden auch die Kunst des literarisch anspruchsvollen Briefwechsels und der literarische Dialog. Der Dialog galt als vorzügliches Mittel zur Übung des Scharfsinns und der Argumentationskunst. Briefe wurden oft gesammelt und veröffentlicht; sie hatten dann einen belletristischen Charakter, waren teils für die Publikation bearbeitet oder frei erfunden. Ihre Verbreitung diente auch der Eigenwerbung und Selbststilisierung ihrer Verfasser., Wer sich eine solche Sichtweise zu eigen machte und in der Lage war, sich mündlich und schriftlich in klassischem Latein elegant und fehlerfrei auszudrücken, wurde von den Humanisten als einer der ihren betrachtet. Erwartet wurde von einem Humanisten, dass er die lateinische Grammatik und die Rhetorik beherrschte, sich in antiker Geschichte und Moralphilosophie sowie in der altrömischen Literatur gut auskannte und lateinisch dichten konnte.

Die zwei hodenförmigen Wurzelknollen der Knabenkräuter (von griechisch ὄρχις \\"orchis\\" ‚Hoden‘) haben der gesamten Pflanzenfamilie ihren Namen gegeben. Nach den Korbblütlern (Asteraceae) stellen die Orchideen die zweitgrößte Familie unter den bedecktsamigen Blütenpflanzen dar. Sie gehören innerhalb der Klasse der Bedecktsamer zu den Einkeimblättrigen Pflanzen (Monokotyledonen). Etwa 1000 Gattungen mit 15.000 bis 30.000 Arten werden von den Botanikern anerkannt., Merkmale., Allgemeines., Die Pflanzentaxa der Familie Orchideen unterscheiden sich nur durch einige wenige eindeutige Merkmale von anderen verwandten Pflanzenfamilien der Einkeimblättrigen Pflanzen. Dabei gibt es trotz der vielfachen Merkmale, die bei den meisten Orchideenarten zu finden sind, nur sehr wenige, die bei allen vorkommen., Orchideen weisen folgende spezifische Merkmale auf:, Orchideen sind in der Regel ausdauernde Pflanzen, könnten theoretisch je nach Wuchsform unbegrenzt lange weiterwachsen (jedes Jahr ein oder mehrere Neutriebe oder permanentes Weiterwachsen eines Sprosses). Tatsächlich ist aber nur sehr wenig darüber bekannt, welches Alter Orchideen erreichen können., Wuchsformen., Orchideen können auf verschiedene Art und Weise wachsen. Man unterscheidet dabei folgende Formen:, Mehr als die Hälfte aller tropischen Arten wachsen als Epiphyten auf Bäumen. Sie besitzen spezielle morphologische (Velamen radicum, Pseudobulben) und physiologische (CAM-Mechanismus) Besonderheiten, um mit den teilweise widrigen Bedingungen wie Trockenheit und Nährstoffmangel im Kronenraum zurechtzukommen., Ihre Größe ist sehr unterschiedlich, sie kann nur wenige Millimeter (\\"Platystele jungermannioides\\", \\"Anathalis manausesis\\") bis zu einigen Metern (Tiger-Orchidee) betragen., Habitus., Man unterscheidet monopodial wachsende Orchideen, die eine an der Spitze weiterwachsende einheitliche Sprossachse besitzen (teilweise auch mit Verzweigungen) und sympodial wachsende Orchideen, die durch Verzweigung nacheinanderfolgende Sprossglieder mit begrenztem Spitzenwachstum ausbilden. Bei den monopodial wachsenden Orchideen dienen Blätter und/oder Wurzeln als Speicherorgane, während die sympodial wachsenden Orchideen dazu mehr oder weniger dicke ein- oder mehrgliedrige Pseudobulben ausbilden. Einige Orchideengattungen bilden auch unterirdische Speicherorgane (Kormus). Neben den beiden angeführten Wachstumsformen gibt es aber auch seltene Abwandlungen, die nicht dem normalen Schema monopodialen vs. sympodialen Wachstums entsprechen. So bilden etwa viele Arten der Pleurothallidinae (z. B. \\"Pleurothallis\\", \\"Lepanthes\\") trotz sympodialen Wuchses keine Pseudobulben aus, sondern haben stattdessen fleischige Blätter., Wurzeln., Orchideen bilden keine Primärwurzel (Pfahlwurzel) aus, sondern nur sekundäre Wurzeln, die dem Spross entspringen. In ihrer Dicke unterscheiden sie sich teilweise ziemlich deutlich. Beim überwiegenden Teil der Orchideen weisen die Wurzeln ein Velamen auf. Neben ihrer Funktion als Aufnahmeorgan für Wasser und Nährstoffe dienen sie oft auch als Haft- und Halteorgan. Dies ist besonders bei epiphytisch wachsenden Arten von Bedeutung. Die Form der Wurzeln hängt im Wesentlichen davon ab, wo sie wachsen. Während die frei in der Luft hängenden Wurzeln der Epiphyten bzw. die Wurzeln, die völlig in den Boden wachsen, meist zylindrisch sind, weisen die Haft- und Haltewurzeln, die auf den Oberflächen wachsen, eine eher abgeflachte Form auf. Bei einigen Arten sind die Wurzeln chlorophylltragend, um auch während klimatisch bedingtem Blattabwurf weiterhin Nährstoffe verarbeiten zu können. Die Wurzeln der Orchideen verzweigen eher selten. Sie haben eine Lebensdauer, die von verschiedenen Umweltfaktoren abhängt und kürzer ist als die des Sprosses. Die Neubildung von Wurzeln erfolgt in der Regel mit dem Wachstum des neuen Sprosses zum Ende der Vegetationsperioden oder auch während der Wachstumsphase. Bei vielen terrestrischen Orchideenarten bilden sich an den Wurzeln Speicherorgane oder knollenähnliche Gebilde. Bei einigen Gattungen ist es möglich, dass sich an den Wurzeln Adventivknospen bilden, aus denen neue Sprosse entstehen., Neben der Mykorrhiza, die für die embryonale Entwicklung aus einem Samen notwendig ist, gibt es auch in den Wurzeln Mykorrhiza. Dabei wachsen die Pilzfäden in die äußeren oder unteren Zellschichten der Wurzeln oder Rhizome. Die Orchideen nehmen auch in diesem Fall durch Verdauung von Pilzteilen oder -ausscheidungen Nährstoffe auf. Da der Pilz, der das Protokorm (Keimknöllchen) befällt, in der Regel nicht mit den neuen Wurzeln nach außen wächst, muss die Mykorrhiza jedes Jahr von neuem (mit der Bildung neuer Wurzeln) ausgebildet werden. Bei ausreichendem Angebot von Licht und Nährstoffen sind Orchideen in der Regel nicht auf diese Mykorrhiza angewiesen. Ausnahmen sind die myko-heterotroph lebenden Orchideen., Blätter., Der überwiegende Teil der Orchideen besitzt parallelnervige Blätter mit kaum sichtbaren Querverbindungen. Sie sitzen in der Regel zweireihig, abwechselnd an den entgegengesetzten Seiten des Sprosses. Viele Orchideen bilden nur ein einziges richtiges Blatt aus, die Anlagen der Blätter sind jedoch ebenfalls zweireihig. Die Form der Blätter und Blattspitzen, die Festigkeit, die Färbung und der Blattaufbau variieren sehr stark., Viele Arten verlieren klimatisch bedingt ihre Blätter, um sie zu Beginn des nächsten Vegetationszyklus neu auszubilden. Während bei dem überwiegenden Teil dieser Arten die Blätter tatsächlich nur einjährig sind, gibt es ebenso Arten, die ihre Blätter nur unter widrigen Standortbedingungen abwerfen bzw. unter günstigen Bedingungen behalten. Es gibt aber auch Arten, die völlig blattlos wachsen (\\"Dendrophylax lindenii\\"). Dafür besitzen sie chlorophylltragende Wurzeln., Blütenstand., Die Blütenstände der Orchideen sind in der Regel traubenförmig, an denen sich je nach Art bis zu hundert und mehr Blüten ausbilden können. Wachsen verzweigte Blütenstände (rispenförmig), so ist die Traubenform jeweils an den äußersten Zweigen zu finden. Neben den trauben- oder rispenförmigen Blütentrieben gibt es aber auch eine Vielzahl von Orchideen, die nur einblütig sind. Bei einigen Arten bilden sich nacheinander mehrere Blüten an demselben Blütentrieb, wobei jedoch nie mehr als eine Blüte geöffnet ist (z.B. \\"Psychopsis papilio\\"). Die Blütenstände können an jeder Stelle des Sprosses der Orchidee entspringen. Dabei wird zwischen endständigen (terminal (an der Triebspitze), apikal (zentral am Triebansatz)) und seitenständigen (lateral) Blütenständen unterschieden. Meist entspringen die Blütentriebe einer Blattachsel. Aufgrund der Wuchsrichtung sind die Blütenstände der monopodialen Orchideen immer seitenständig. Die einzelnen Blüten werden stets von einer Braktee (Tragblatt) gestützt, die meist unauffällig ist., Blüte., Keine andere Pflanzenfamilie hat ein solches Spektrum, was Formen und Farben der Blüten anbelangt, wie die Familie der Orchideen. Die Größe der Blüten variiert von einigen Millimetern (Beispiel \\"Lepanthes calodictyon\\") bis zu 20 Zentimetern und mehr pro Blüte (Beispiel \\"Paphiopedilum hangianum\\"). Das Farbspektrum reicht dabei von zartem Weiß über Grün- und Blautöne bis zu kräftigen Rot- und Gelbtönen. Viele der Orchideenblüten sind mehrfarbig., Außer bei einigen Gattungen (zum Beispiel \\"Catasetum\\") sind die dreizähligen Blüten der Orchideen zwittrig. Die Blütenhülle (Perianth) besteht aus zwei Kreisen. Es gibt einen äußeren Hüllblattkreis, der aus drei Kelchblättern (Sepalen) besteht und einen inneren Hüllblattkreis, der aus drei Kronblättern (Petalen) besteht. Die Blütenblätter können frei oder zu einem gewissen Grad miteinander verwachsen sein. Bei einigen Orchideengattungen, so etwa in der Unterfamilie Cypripedioideae oder bei \\"Acriopsis\\", sind die unteren beiden Sepalen komplett verwachsen. Das in der Symmetrieachse gelegene Blütenhüllblatt des inneren Hüllkreises ist in der Regel deutlich abweichend was Größe, Farbe und Form betrifft. Es bildet die Lippe (Labellum) der Orchideenblüte. Bei vielen Orchideen ist die Lippe auf der Rückseite zu einem schlauchigen bis sackigen Gebilde verlängert, dem so genannten Sporn (Beispiele \\"Aeranthes\\", \\"Aerangis\\"). In ihm befindet sich entweder Nektar oder er ist leer. Andere Arten bilden aus der Lippe einen „Schuh“ (zum Beispiel die Gattungen der Unterfamilien Cypripedioideae). Außerdem sind Säule (Gynostemium) und der Fruchtknoten wesentliche Bestandteile der Blüten. Im Grundaufbau unterscheidet man monandrische (ein fertiles Staubblatt, Beispiele \\"Cattleya\\", \\"Phalaenopsis\\") und diandrische (zwei fertile Staubblätter, Beispiel \\"Paphiopedilum\\", \\"Cypripedium\\") Orchideen. Der Fruchtknoten ist bei Orchideen unterständig. Die anderen Blütenteile (Sepalen und Petalen, Säule, Lippe) sind mit diesem vollständig verwachsen und stehen über ihm. In der Regel ist der Fruchtknoten nur sehr schmal und schwillt erst nach der Bestäubung an (Ausbildung der Samenkapsel)., Die Blüten der Orchideen sind mit Ausnahme einiger Gattungen (Beispiel \\"Ludisia\\" und \\"Mormodes\\" mit asymmetrischen Blüten) bilateral-symmetrisch (zygomorph). Das heißt, dass man durch die Mitte der Blüte eine Spiegelachse legen kann, und zwar nur eine einzige (monosymmetrisch)., Eine zentrale Rolle in der Fortpflanzung von Orchideen spielen die besonderen Pollenanhäufungen. Die von den Staubblättern gebildeten Pollen sind zu zwei lockeren oder festen Bündeln verklebt (Pollinien). Diese beiden Klumpen hängen auf einem mehr oder weniger langen Schaft mit einer Klebscheibe (Viscidium), sie haftet an dem Bestäuber durch eine Flüssigkeit aus der Klebdrüse (Rostellum)., Früchte., Fast alle Orchideenfrüchte sind Kapseln.

Die Beförderung mittels Luftpost erfolgt zum Teil nur gegen eine Entrichtung erhöhter Postgebühren, die früher mitunter durch Freimachung mit besonderen Luftpostwertzeichen eingezogen wurden. Die wissenschaftliche Auseinandersetzung mit der Luftpostgeschichte sowie das systematische Sammeln von Luftpostwertzeichen und Belegstücken heißt Aerophilatelie., Historische Entwicklung., Die Anfänge der Luftpost., Bereits im Altertum wurden Botschaften mittels \\"Flugpost\\" überbracht, indem Brieftauben als Überbringer von Nachrichten eingesetzt wurden. Erstmals wurden Tauben im Alten Ägypten zur Nachrichtenüberbringung eingesetzt. Dieser besonders schnellen Art der Überbringung von Botschaften wurde militärische, politische und auch wirtschaftliche Beachtung beigemessen. Im Jahre 1279 v. Chr. wurde die Kunde von der Krönung des ägyptischen Pharaos Ramses II. durch vier freigelassene Tauben verbreitet. Brieftauben wurden auch von anderen Hochkulturen verwendet. Der römische Feldherr Julius Caesar bediente sich der besonderen Fähigkeiten der Brieftaube. Er ließ Nachrichten von Unruhen im eroberten Gallien durch eigene \\"Botentauben\\" überbringen, um so schnell wie möglich seine Truppen befehligen zu können., Auch im Mittelalter wurde die Brieftaube als Nachrichtenüberbringer eingesetzt. Der Kalif von Bagdad, \\"Nur-Eddin\\", richtete seine eigene \\"Brieftaubenpost\\" ein. Sie wurde allerdings nach der Zerstörung Bagdads im Jahre 1258 durch die Mongolen wieder eingestellt. Auch ägyptische Sultane richteten im Mittelalter eine eigene \\"staatliche Taubenpost\\" ein. Kreuzritter führten Brieftauben im 12. und 13. Jahrhundert aus dem Vorderen Orient erneut nach Europa ein., Die ersten Flugmaschinen., Zur Zeit der Renaissance tauchten in Europa die ersten ernstzunehmenden Entwürfe von Flugmaschinen auf. Die bekanntesten stammen vom italienischen Universalgenie Leonardo da Vinci. Die ersten flugtauglichen Konstruktionen entstanden jedoch erst über 250Jahre später. Die Brüder Montgolfier entdeckten durch einen Zufall, dass heiße Luft stark genug ist, um eine Papiertüte in die Luft zu heben. Diese Entdeckung war die Grundlage der Entwicklung des ersten Heißluftballons, der Montgolfière. Am 21. November 1783 fand die erste Fahrt eines Menschen mit einem Heißluftballon statt., Die Erfindung des Heißluftballons hatte große Auswirkungen auf die Geschichte der Luftpost. Bereits ein Jahr nach der ersten bemannten Ballonfahrt nahmen die Piloten kleinere Nachrichten oder Mitteilungen auf ihre Fahrten mit. Jedoch kam es erst im Jahre 1793 zum eigentlichen Beginn der Ballonpostgeschichte. Aus den beiden belagerten Festungen Valenciennes und Condé in Frankreich wurden mit kleinen Ballons Mitteilungen für die Verbündeten der Eingeschlossenen aufgelassen. Diese Nachrichten wurden allerdings von den Feinden abgefangen. In den folgenden Jahrzehnten kam es zur weiteren Anwendungen von Ballons zur Nachrichtenübermittlung im Krieg., Das berühmteste Beispiel unter Philatelisten aller Welt ist die Pariser Ballonpost. Die Verbindung zwischen Paris und dem unbesetzten Frankreich während des Deutsch-Französischen Krieges in den Jahren 1870 und 1871 konnte nur durch ein geschicktes Zusammenspiel zwischen Ballonpost und Brieftauben aufrechterhalten werden. Man gab den Ballonen aus Paris neben 2.500.000 Briefen und Postkarten insgesamt 363 Brieftauben mit, damit diese später mit Antworten oder anderen Nachrichten zurückkehren konnten. In Metz kam es ebenfalls während des Deutsch-Französischen Krieges zu ähnlichen Versuchen, mit Ballonen Verbündeten Nachrichten zukommen zu lassen (vergleiche Metzer Ballonpost)., Der erste amtliche Ballonpostflug fand am 17. Juli 1859 in den USA statt. Dieser führte von St. Louis in das 1290km entfernte Henderson in New York. Der Pilot John Wise hatte 123 Briefe an Bord. Nur einer dieser posthistorischen Belege ist erhalten geblieben. In Deutschland fand der erste amtliche Ballonpostflug im Rahmen der Leipziger Gewerbeausstellung im Juni 1897 statt. Der Pilot \\"Louis Godard\\" übergab die beförderten Postkarten nach der Landung der Reichspost zur Weiterbeförderung. Die Karten erhielten private Bestätigungsstempel., Bis zum Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts fanden solche Luftpostbeförderungen immer im Rahmen von besonderen Veranstaltungen oder aus militärischen Gründen statt. Der deutsche Generalpostmeister Heinrich von Stephan wies jedoch in einem vielbeachteten Vortrag auf die mögliche Bedeutung der Luftpost für die alltägliche Postbeförderung im Jahre 1874 hin. Dieser Vortrag erschien sogar als Buch unter dem Titel \\"„Weltpost und Luftschifffahrt“\\"., Die Erfindung des Flugzeugs., Nichts hatte größere Auswirkungen auf die Geschichte der Luftpost als die Erfindung des Flugzeugs. Nach den ersten Flugversuchen Otto Lilienthals mit seinem Derwitzer Gleiter im Frühjahr 1891 fand am 17. Dezember 1903 der erste motorisierte Flug der Welt (Brüder Wright) statt. Fünf Jahre später kam es zu der ersten Beförderung von Postsendungen durch Flugzeuge: Am 12. August 1909 wurden im Rahmen einer Flugausstellung Sonderstempel für einen Rundflug über Mailand ausgegeben. Einen Monat später, am 20. September 1909, wurden anlässlich eines Rundflugs über die italienische Stadt Brescia mitgeflogene Belege mit einem ähnlichen Sonderstempel versehen. Bei diesen beiden Veranstaltungen wurden die Postsendungen jedoch nicht weiterbefördert., Der erste offizielle Postbeförderungsflug zwischen zwei Orten fand am 18. Februar 1911 während einer Kunst- und Gewerbeausstellung in Indien statt. Der junge französische Pilot Henri Pequet transportierte etwa 6500 Briefe vom Ausstellungsort Allahabad in das etwa acht Kilometer entfernte Naini. Henri Pequet benötigte für diese Strecke mit seinem Doppeldecker \\"Sommer\\" ungefähr 13Minuten. Die mitgeflogenen Belege wurden mit dem Bestätigungsstempel \\"First Aerial Post, U.P. Exhibition Allahabad 1911\\" versehen., In England wurde der erste regelmäßige Luftpostdienst am 9. September 1911 zwischen Hendon und Windsor aufgenommen., Ein Jahr später, am 19. Mai 1912, fand der erste offizielle Postflug der Deutschen Reichspost zwischen Mannheim und Heidelberg statt (allerdings wurde die meiste Post nicht, wie vorgesehen, mit dem Luftschiff, sondern auf dem herkömmlichen Wege befördert). Mit Genehmigung des Reichs-Postamtes vom 1.Juni 1912 wurde dann vom 10. bis 23. Juni 1912 im Rahmen einer Wohltätigkeitsveranstaltung eine Luftpostbeförderung mit Zeppelin und Flugzeug und halbamtlichen Flugpostmarken, der sogenannten Flugpost am Rhein und am Main genehmigt. Zuvor gab es in Deutschland bereits mehrere private Postbeförderungen mit Flugzeugen ohne Genehmigung der Post. Die erste Veranstaltung dieser Art wurde am 13. November 1911 in Berlin durchgeführt., Bei der Veranstaltung \\"Flug um Berlin\\" wurden Postkarten für Sammler auf den Flug mitgenommen. Die zweite Veranstaltung dieser Art war ein Flug über acht Kilometer zwischen den Orten Bork und Brück. Bei dieser Flugveranstaltung wurden erstmals Flugmarken ausgegeben. Sie dienten ausschließlich zur Finanzierung der Veranstaltung und hatten keinen postalischen Wert. Der Initiator der Aktion waren der Berliner Zahnarzt und Vorsitzende des Verkehrsvereins Borkheide Kurt Schaefer und sein Freund Hans Grade, der als Unternehmer die ersten Flugzeuge zu dieser Zeit produzierte. So startete am 18. Februar 1912 ein Grade-Flugzeug und bewerkstelligte damit die erste Flugpostbeförderung mit Flugmarken in Deutschland von Bork nach Brück. In Aleksandar Lifkas \\"Kinematographischem Bericht der Ereignisse der letzten Woche\\" wurde über diese Luftpostbeförderung unter dem Titel \\"Die erste deutsche Luftpost zwischen Bork und Brück\\" berichtet; der Film wurde auch in österreichischen Kinos aufgeführt., Der Schweizer Flugpionier Oskar Bider transportierte am 9.März 1913 die erste schweizerische Luftpost auf der Strecke Basel–Liestal., In den folgenden Jahren gab es bis zum Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkrieges eine intensive Zusammenarbeit der Reichspost mit den Veranstaltern der Postflüge (siehe zum Beispiel \\"Flugpost am Rhein und am Main\\"). In anderen Ländern wurde jedoch selbst während des Krieges am Aufbau eines zivilen Luftpostnetzwerkes gearbeitet. In Italien wurden 1917 die ersten Flugpostmarken der Welt ausgegeben. Diese wurden zur Bezahlung der Postgebühren für die Beförderung per Luftpost auf den Strecken Turin–Rom und Rom–Palermo verwendet. Dabei handelte es sich noch um einen Probebetrieb. In Österreich wurde am 31. März 1918 die erste regelmäßige Flugpostlinie zwischen Wien, Krakau, Lemberg und Kiew eingerichtet. Dafür wurden ebenfalls eigene Flugpostmarken ausgegeben. Diese regelmäßige Postbeförderung durch Flugzeuge wird von vielen Philatelisten als eigentlicher Beginn der Flugpostgeschichte angesehen. Aber auch während des Ersten Weltkrieges wurde versucht eine \\"Militärflugpost\\" aufzubauen, die das Ziel verfolgte eingeschlossene Soldaten mit Informationen aus der Heimat zu versorgen. So kann man als erste Militärflugpost den Flug von österreichisch-ungarischen Fliegern zu den Soldaten in das durch die Russen umschlossene Przemyśl im Oktober 1914 bezeichnen., Die ersten regelmäßigen staatlichen Flugpostverbindungen unter deutscher Regie wurden gegen Ende des Ersten Weltkrieges an der Ostfront in Russland und im Baltikum eingerichtet. Die Geschichte der zivilen Luftpost in Deutschland begann am 6.Februar 1919. Der Anlass war die Eröffnung der Konstituierung der Nationalversammlung in Weimar. Von diesem Tag an starteten zweimal täglich Flugzeuge der Deutschen Luft-Reederei in Berlin-Johannisthal, um Postsendungen – vor allem Zeitungen – von der Hauptstadt zum Tagungsort in Weimar zu transportieren. Diese Flugpostverbindung konnte vorerst ausschließlich von den Abgeordneten der Nationalversammlung in Anspruch genommen werden, die wegen der revolutionären Lage in Berlin in die damalige thüringische Hauptstadt ausgewichen war. Wenige Monate später wurde diese Flugpostlinie auch für die Öffentlichkeit freigegeben., Im März 1919 richteten dann die Junkers-Flugzeugwerke in Dessau den regelmäßigen Flugdienst nach Weimar ein. Im gleichen Jahr wurde auch in Bayern regelmäßige Postflüge eingerichtet., In den folgenden Jahren fand ein rascher Ausbau des Flugpostverbindungen in Deutschland wie auch in ganz Westeuropa und den USA statt. Am 11. August 1920 wurden die ersten Flugpostflüge von Deutschland ins Ausland durchgeführt. Das angeflogene Ziel war die schwedische Hafenstadt Malmö., Ab dem Jahr 1921 führte die Deutsche Reichspost besondere Flugpostbestätigungsstempel und Flugpostklebezettel ein. Im Jahre 1922 bestanden bereits 13 verschiedene Luftpostlinien. Im Mai 1923 wurden in Berlin die ersten Luftpostbriefkästen Deutschlands aufgestellt.

Jahrhundert v. Chr., Gestorben im 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr., Grieche (Antike), Literatur (Altgriechisch), Literatur (Sizilien), Literatur der Antike, Mann, Mediziner der griechischen Antike], Empedokles (; * um 495 v. Chr. in Akragas, dem heutigen Agrigent auf Sizilien; † um 435 v. Chr. wohl auf der Peloponnes), genannt auch Empedokles von Agrigent, war ein antiker griechischer Philosoph, Naturforscher, Politiker, Redner und Dichter. Unklar ist, ob die Behauptungen zutreffen, wonach er sich auch als Arzt, Magier und Wahrsager betätigte. Zahlreiche Geschichten über sein Leben und seinen Tod tragen legendenhafte Züge. Als Politiker war er in seiner Heimatstadt Akragas umstritten und musste ins Exil gehen, aus dem er nicht mehr zurückkehrte., Als Vorsokratiker war Empedokles vom Gedankengut bedeutender Strömungen seiner Zeit, der Pythagoreer und der Eleaten, beeinflusst, konzipierte aber ein eigenständiges Weltmodell. Seine Philosophie ist in seinen beiden nur fragmentarisch erhaltenen Gedichten – dem Lehrgedicht „Über die Natur“ und den „Reinigungen“ – dargelegt. Wie bei den vorsokratischen Naturphilosophen üblich, befasste er sich mit der Frage der Weltentstehung (Kosmogonie) und versuchte, die Ordnung und Beschaffenheit des Weltalls zu klären (Kosmologie). In diesem Zusammenhang entwickelte er eine von mythischem Denken geprägte physikalische und biologische Theorie, zu der auch eine Vorstellung von der Entstehung des Lebens auf der Erde und der Evolution der Lebewesen gehörte. Er führte die Lehre von den vier Urstoffen (bzw. „Elementen“) Luft, Feuer, Erde und Wasser ein. Diese Vier-Elemente-Lehre wurde für das naturwissenschaftliche Weltbild der Antike maßgeblich, steht am Anfang chemischen und chemisch-biologischen Denkens und beeinflusste bis ins 19. Jahrhundert auch die Medizin., Eine zentrale Rolle spielen in seiner Philosophie ethische und religiöse Überzeugungen, die eng mit seiner Lehre von der Reinkarnation verknüpft sind; im Mittelpunkt steht die Forderung nach Gewaltlosigkeit. Die Legende von seinem Tod im Vulkan Ätna beschäftigte die Fantasie der Nachwelt bis in die Moderne., Quellen., Die Hauptquelle für das Leben des Empedokles ist das ihm gewidmete Kapitel im achten Buch der Philosophenbiografien des Doxographen Diogenes Laertios. Diogenes beruft sich für seine Angaben über Empedokles auf 22 heute verlorene Schriften verschiedener Autoren, die ihm aber möglicherweise zum Teil nur aus Zitaten in späterer Literatur bekannt waren. Seinen Quellen entnahm er insbesondere anekdotisches Material., Die überlieferten Geschichten dienen großenteils der mitunter drastischen Veranschaulichung von angeblichen oder tatsächlichen Charakterzügen oder Fähigkeiten des Philosophen. Manche Anekdoten sind unglaubwürdig, viele wirken zumindest sagenhaft ausgeschmückt. Manchmal ist – wie bei Heraklit – erkennbar, dass der Urheber einer Behauptung oder Geschichte beabsichtigte, den Philosophen lächerlich zu machen. Einige Angaben über Empedokles’ Leben sind möglicherweise aus einer biografischen Interpretation von Stellen in seiner Dichtung entstanden. Tatsächlich können einzelne Bemerkungen des Dichters einen autobiografischen Hintergrund haben, doch ist bei derartigen Folgerungen Vorsicht geboten. Generell ist die Glaubwürdigkeit der Überlieferung umstritten., Da die Lehrdichtung des Empedokles nur bruchstückhaft erhalten ist, sind auch Werke anderer Autoren wichtige Quellen für seine Lehre. Eine Reihe von Informationen liefern Aristoteles und Plutarch sowie Aristoteles-Kommentatoren (insbesondere Simplikios). Plutarchs umfangreiche Monographie über Empedokles ist bis auf ein Fragment verloren, doch äußert er sich auch in seinen erhaltenen Schriften über den Vorsokratiker und zitiert ihn., Leben und Wirken., Die Geburt des Empedokles lässt sich nur ungefähr datieren; da er etwas jünger war als sein Zeitgenosse Anaxagoras, fällt sie wohl in die ersten Jahre des 5. Jahrhunderts. Er stammte aus einer vornehmen und reichen Familie seiner Heimatstadt Akragas. Sein Großvater, der ebenfalls Empedokles hieß, war Pferdezüchter und Sieger bei den Olympischen Spielen von 496. Sein Vater Meton war ein prominenter Politiker. Nach dem Tode des um 472 v. Chr. gestorbenen Tyrannen Theron begannen in Akragas unruhige Zeiten. Der Nachfolger des Tyrannen, sein Sohn Thrasydaios, musste nach nur einjähriger Herrschaft ins Exil gehen. Bei dieser politischen Neuorientierung der Stadt spielte Meton auf der Seite der Tyrannengegner eine führende Rolle. Angeblich wurde Empedokles die Königswürde angeboten, die er jedoch ablehnte. Sicher ist, dass sich die Idee einer demokratischen Staatsordnung durchsetzte. Empedokles engagierte sich auf der Seite der Demokratiebefürworter und trat energisch gegen Bestrebungen auf, die nach seiner Einschätzung auf eine Tyrannenherrschaft abzielten. Er erreichte die Auflösung einer Organisation, die als „Versammlung der Tausend“ bezeichnet wurde und wohl oligarchische Ziele verfolgte. Eine von Diogenes Laertios mitgeteilte Anekdote über Todesurteile, die er veranlasst haben soll, ist allerdings unglaubwürdig; es handelt sich wohl um eine Erfindung eines Komödiendichters. Anscheinend war Empedokles ein begabter Redner, Aristoteles bezeichnete ihn sogar als Erfinder der Rhetorik., Empedokles’ Verhältnis zu älteren und zeitgenössischen Philosophen ist schwer zu bestimmen. In der Antike galt er als Schüler des Pythagoras oder von frühen Pythagoreern. Diese Annahme war wegen der Verwandtschaft seiner Lehre mit pythagoreischem Gedankengut naheliegend. Ein direktes Schülerverhältnis zu Pythagoras ist allerdings aus chronologischem Grund ausgeschlossen. Außerdem bezeichnet ihn eine antike Überlieferung als Schüler des Parmenides, dessen Lehre ihn jedenfalls beeinflusst hat., Der biografischen Überlieferung zufolge war Empedokles auch ein erfolgreicher Arzt. Er soll eine Scheintote geheilt haben, die von ihren Ärzten bereits aufgegeben worden war. Ob in dieser legendenhaft ausgeschmückten Geschichte von einer spektakulären Heilung ein historischer Kern steckt, ist unklar. Dass Empedokles Gesundheitsberatung erteilte, erwähnt er selbst. In einer Aufzählung der vier vornehmsten Berufe nennt er die Ärzte neben Weissagern, Dichtern und Fürsten; das ist möglicherweise ein Indiz dafür, dass er den Arztberuf selbst ausgeübt hat. Dazu passt auch sein ausgeprägtes Interesse an biologischen Themen., Wegen eines politischen Konflikts hielt sich Empedokles im Exil auf; als er nach Akragas zurückkehren wollte, verhinderten dies mächtige Gegner. Der von Diogenes Laertios zitierte Geschichtsschreiber Timaios von Tauromenion berichtet, der Philosoph sei nach Griechenland ausgewandert und habe sich auf der Peloponnes niedergelassen; von dort sei er nicht mehr zurückgekehrt. Mit Berufung auf Aristoteles und Herakleides Pontikos schreibt Diogenes, Empedokles sei sechzig Jahre alt geworden; daraus folgt, dass sein Tod wohl um die Mitte der dreißiger Jahre des 5. Jahrhunderts zu datieren ist. Die Todesumstände sind unbekannt., Von Empedokles sind keine Bildnisse erhalten. Diogenes Laertios berichtet von einer Statue des Philosophen in Akragas, die später in Rom aufgestellt worden sei, sowie von Gemälden., Selbstbild., Sehr ungewöhnlich ist Empedokles’ außerordentliches stark entwickeltes Selbstbewusstsein, das in seinen Versen drastisch zum Ausdruck kommt. Der Ich-Sprecher in seiner Dichtung nimmt die Haltung eines unfehlbaren Weisheitslehrers ein, verkündet seinen eigenen Ruhm und schreibt sich übermenschliche Fähigkeiten zu. Einer gängigen Interpretation zufolge nimmt er an einer Stelle sogar ausdrücklich Göttlichkeit für sich in Anspruch. Dies erregte schon in der Antike Aufsehen und Anstoß und trug dem Dichter den Vorwurf der Arroganz und Scharlatanerie ein. Auch in der Neuzeit hat die Annahme, er habe sich für einen Gott gehalten, die Empedokles-Rezeption stark beeinflusst. Allerdings ist nicht sicher, dass die in diesem Zusammenhang zitierten Verse als Selbstbeschreibung des Dichters gemeint waren. Nach einer alternativen Deutung der Verse wird die Göttlichkeit nicht als Tatsache behauptet, sondern nur als Eindruck erwähnt, den die Umwelt erhielt., Werke., Empedokles schrieb eine Anzahl von Werken, die großenteils verloren sind. Erhalten sind Fragmente seiner beiden bekanntesten Dichtungen, des philosophischen Lehrgedichts „Über die Natur“ und der „Reinigungen“ \\"(Katharmoí)\\", die beide in Hexametern abgefasst waren. Die überlieferten Bezeichnungen des Naturgedichts – „Über die Natur“ \\"(Peri phýseōs)\\", „Über die Natur des Seienden“ \\"(Peri phýseōs tōn óntōn)\\" oder „Physik“ \\"(Physiká)\\" – waren ursprünglich nur Angaben des Themas; sie waren nicht als Werktitel im später geläufigen Sinne gemeint, denn vom Verfasser verbindlich festgelegte Titel philosophischer Werke waren damals noch nicht üblich. Die herkömmliche, weiterhin vorherrschende Lehrmeinung lautet, dass das Naturgedicht und die „Reinigungen“ zwei unterschiedliche Werke sind, von denen das eine in erster Linie die Naturphilosophie behandelt, das andere primär einem religiösen Zweck dient. Seit 1987 wird in der Forschung aber auch die Ansicht vertreten, es handle sich um nur ein Werk. Ausdrücklich bezeugt ist die Existenz zweier verschiedener Gedichte nur bei Diogenes Laertios. Die Hypothese, wonach es sich um ein einziges Gedicht handelt, hat sich aber nicht durchsetzen können., Den Gesamtumfang der beiden Gedichte gibt Diogenes Laertios mit rund 5000 Versen an. Erhalten sind insgesamt etwa 500 Verse; sie sind größtenteils nur aus Zitaten in späterer antiker Literatur bekannt, doch sind darunter auch einige Dutzend Verse bzw. Versteile aus dem ersten Buch des Naturgedichts, die nur im Straßburger Empedokles-Papyrus stehen. Bei diesem aus dem späten 1. Jahrhundert stammenden Papyrus handelt es sich um 52 Bruchstücke einer Papyrusrolle, die als Unterlage eines aufgeklebten Schmuckkragens aus Kupferblech dienten. Der Kragen wurde schon 1904 von dem Archäologen Otto Rubensohn erworben, aber erst 1992 sind die Papyrus-Bruchstücke als Teil von Empedokles’ Werk identifiziert worden., Die Verteilung der erhaltenen Fragmente auf die beiden großen Gedichte ist teils gesichert, teils hypothetisch.

Die Definition ist uneinheitlich: Manche Autoren bezeichnen nur Strukturen mit Membran als Organellen, also beispielsweise Zellkern, Mitochondrien, Plastiden (mit Chloroplasten), den Golgi-Apparat und das Endoplasmatische Retikulum. Andere fassen den Begriff weiter und schließen auch andere Strukturen ein, beispielsweise Centriolen. Bei Einzellern wird „Organell“ in diesem Sinn als Bezeichnung für komplexe Strukturen wie Geißel und Augenfleck verwendet., Einzellige Lebewesen ohne Zellkern (Prokaryoten) haben in der Regel keine Membranen im Inneren der Zelle und demnach auch keine Organellen nach der ersten Definition. Es gibt jedoch prokaryotische Strukturen, die als Organellen im weiteren Sinn aufgefasst werden können, beispielsweise Geißeln., Zum Auffinden weiterer zellulärer Strukturen (wie Organellen) kommen heute auch KI-gestützte Methoden zum Einsatz. Man schätzt, dass derzeit nicht einmal die Hälfte aller solcher Strukturen bekannt ist (Stand November 2021)., Begriffsgeschichte und Definitionen., Als \\"Organ\\" wird in der Biologie eine abgegrenzte Funktionseinheit innerhalb eines Lebewesens bezeichnet. Die Analogie zu den mikroskopischen Strukturen innerhalb einer Zelle ist für Autoren entsprechender Lehrbücher anscheinend so offensichtlich, dass sie nicht näher erläutert wird. Der erste, der für entsprechende zelluläre Strukturen eine Verkleinerungsform des Wortes ‚Organ‘ benutzte, war vermutlich der deutsche Zoologe Karl August Möbius (1884):, Organulum (Plural: Organula) ist die Verkleinerungsform zum lateinischen Organum. In einer Fußnote, die als Berichtigung in der folgenden Ausgabe der Zeitschrift erschien, erklärte Möbius:, Die ursprünglichste Definition des Begriffs beschränkte sich demnach ausschließlich auf Zellbestandteile von Einzellern., Einige etwas später erschienene Arbeiten nennen Möbius namentlich als Urheber., Es dauerte noch etliche Jahre, bis die Bezeichnung \\"Organulum\\" oder die neuere Entsprechung \\"Organell\\" sich generell durchsetzten und in einer erweiterten Bedeutung damit auch Bestandteile von Zellen mehrzelliger Organismen bezeichnet wurden. Bücher und Lehrbücher um 1900, von Valentin Häcker, Edmund Wilson und Oscar Hertwig, sprachen noch von den \\"Organen\\" der Zelle. Später wurden beide Bezeichnungen wohl eine Zeit lang nebeneinander verwendet: Bengt Lidforss schrieb 1915: „Eine Neubildung dieser Organe oder Organellen findet wenigstens bei höheren Pflanzen nicht statt“., Gegen 1920 wurde der Ausdruck \\"Organell\\" benutzt für die Antriebsstrukturen („motor organelle complex“, Flagellen und deren Verankerung) und andere Strukturen von Einzellern. Alfred Kühn schrieb 1920 von den Centriolen als \\"Teilungsorganellen\\", für welche allerdings bei den Vahlkampfien gelte, dass „die Alternative: Organell oder Produkt der Strukturbildung“ noch nicht entschieden sei – ohne aber darauf einzugehen, worin der Unterschied zwischen beiden Alternativen läge., Max Hartmann benutzte den Ausdruck 1953 in einem Lehrbuch für extrazelluläre (Pellicula, Schalen, Zellwände) und intrazelluläre Skelette der Einzeller., Erst später bildete sich die \\"heute weit verbreitete Definition\\" heraus, nach der nur von einer Membran umgebene Zellbestandteile als Organellen angesehen werden. Manchmal wird dies noch weiter eingeschränkt und nur Mitochondrien und Plastiden, die ein eigenes Genom haben, werden als Organellen bezeichnet. Aber auch die ursprünglichere Definition der subzellulären Funktionseinheiten im Allgemeinen ist weiterhin in Benutzung., Der Ursprung der Bezeichnung \\"Organell\\" im deutschen Sprachraum scheint vergessen worden zu sein. Albert Frey-Wyssling schrieb 1978 vom „englischen Terminus ‚the organelle‘“, der häufig falsch mit ‚die Organelle‘ statt mit ‚das Organell‘ übersetzt würde. Frey-Wyssling schlug vor, dass sämtliche Energie verbrauchenden Strukturelemente der Zelle und nur diese als Organellen bezeichnet werden sollten, also beispielsweise auch Centrosomen, Ribosomen und Nucleoli. Diese Energie-abhängige Definition hat sich jedoch nicht durchgesetzt., Im Gegensatz zur Bezeichnung \\"Organell\\", welche sich immer auf ein einzelnes Objekt bezieht (etwa \\"ein\\" Mitochondrium), wird die Bezeichnung \\"Kompartiment\\" für die Summe aller gleichartigen zellulären Räume verwendet. Eine Zelle kann demnach viele Mitochondrien haben, aber nur ein mitochondriales Kompartiment. Auch das Cytoplasma ist ein Kompartiment, aber kein Organell., Membranbegrenzte Organellen., Mitochondrien, der Zellkern und Plastiden (Chloroplasten und deren Verwandte) sind von einer doppelten Membran umgeben. Andere membranbegrenzte Organellen haben eine einfache Membran. Hierzu zählen die Komponenten des Endomembransystems und bei Pflanzen die Zellsaftvakuole. Daneben gibt es einige spezielle membranbegrenzte Organellen, die nur in bestimmten Zelltypen oder bestimmten eukaryotischen Artengruppen, meist Einzellern, auftreten., Semiautonome Organellen., Die bei fast allen Eukaryoten vorkommenden Mitochondrien und die für Algen und höhere Pflanzen spezifischen Plastiden haben ein eigenes Genom (Mitogenom bzw. Plastom) und eine eigene Maschinerie zur Proteinbiosynthese (Mitoribosomen bzw. Plastoribosomen). Sie werden daher als ‚semiautonome Organellen‘ bezeichnet., Nach der Endosymbiontentheorie handelt es sich bei ihnen stammesgeschichtlich gesehen um Abkömmlinge von Bakterien, die von frühen eukaryotischen Zellen aufgenommen wurden. Diese Bakterien wurden im Lauf der Evolution in die Zelle integriert. Durch die Anwesenheit der Mitochondrien-Vorläufer (von α-Proteobakterien abstammend) war es der frühen eukaryotischen, zuvor anaeroben, Zelle erstmals möglich, die sehr viel effektivere sauerstoffabhängige Energiegewinnung zu nutzen. Durch die Aufnahme von Cyanobakterien, die sich zu den Plastiden entwickelten, war die Nutzung des Sonnenlichts zur Energiegewinnung möglich: Es entstanden eukaryotische Algen und damit die Vorläufer aller Pflanzen., Semiautonome Organellen haben eine Doppelmembran: Die äußere wird von der Wirtszelle gebildet, ist also eukaryotischen Ursprungs. Sie leitet sich ab von der bei der Aufnahme der Organell-Vorgänger abgeschnürten Plasmamembran. Die innere Membran ist prokaryotischen Ursprungs. Hierbei handelt es sich um die modifizierte Plasmamembran des Symbionten. Sie stellt eine Diffusionsxadbarriere für den Austausch von Molekülen und Elektronen dar., Überflüssige Strukturen der Bakterienzellen gingen verloren, die meisten Gene wurden in den Zellkern der Wirtszelle transferiert oder gingen ebenfalls verloren. Einige Gene wurden aber auch zum Genom der Organellen zugefügt, z.B. Gene für den Austausch von Proteinen und Aminosäuren mit der Wirtszelle. Übrig blieben die heute noch vorhandenen Reste des aus einem ringförmigen DNA-Molekül bestehenden prokaryotischen Genoms und Strukturen, die für die Funktion der Organellen wichtig sind., Semiautonome Organellen vermehren sich eigenständig durch Teilung. Bei der Teilung der Wirtszelle werden sie auf die Tochterzellen aufgeteilt., Ebenfalls semiautonome komplexe Plastiden entstehen durch Aufnahme einer Algenzelle, deren Plastiden eine verschachtelte Struktur wie eine Matrjoschka-Puppe mit insgesamt 3 oder 4 Membranen zeigen, außen mit einer oder zwei eukaryotischen Membranen., Andere häufige membranbegrenzte Organellen., Neben den semiautonomen Organellen hat nur der Zellkern eine doppelte Membran, die Kernhülle. Die in diesem Abschnitt beschriebenen Organellen kommen in der Regel in allen Zellen eines Organismus vor. Hierzu gehören bei Pflanzen die Zellsaftvakuole und bei allen Eukaryoten verschiedene Komponenten des Endomembransystems: das Endoplasmatische Retikulum (ER), der Golgi-Apparat, Lysosomen und Peroxisomen. Eine Kurzbeschreibung dieser Organellen findet sich im Artikel Zelle an dieser Stelle.Transport-Vesikel, die für Stoffaustausch zwischen den anderen Komponenten sorgen, gehören ebenfalls zum Endomembransystem. Deren Einschluss in die Definition eines Organells ist uneinheitlich: Manchmal werden einzelne Vesikel als Organellen bezeichnet, manchmal nicht., Pflanzliche Zellen., In Pflanzenzellen fehlen Endosomen. Dafür haben sie Plastiden und eine Zellsaftvakuole. Eine Pflanzenzelle hat mindestens einen der Plastidtypen Chloroplast, Chromoplast und Leukoplast. Während der Differenzierung kann sich ein Plastidtyp in einen anderen umwandeln. Plastiden enthalten mit eigener DNA auch eigene Ribosomen (Plastoribosomen)., Spezielle membranbegrenzte Organellen., Zelltyp-spezifische Organellen von Mehrzellern., Die hier gelisteten Organellen kommen nur in einigen Zelltypen von bestimmten mehrzelligen Lebewesen vor, in anderen Zelltypen derselben Lebewesen aber nicht., Taxonspezifische Organellen., Hier sind Organellen aufgeführt, die in eukaryotischen Einzellern oder bei bestimmten mehrzelligen Arten in allen Zellen auftreten. Komplexe Plastiden wie die Apicoplasten können eigene Organellen besitzen (Nucleomorph, ein reduzierter Zellkern) und verschiedene Arten von Ribosomen. Die Plastiden der Rotalgen werden auch als Rhodoplasten, die der Glaucophyten und der photosynthetisch aktiven Arten von \\"Paulinella\\" (wegen ihrer Ursprünglichkeit) als Cyanellen (cyanobakterienartige Organellen) bezeichnet. Weitere komplexe Organellen sind die Augenflecken zumeist photosynthetisierender, begeißelter Protisten und vor allem die Ocelloide einzelliger Dinoflagellaten der Familie Warnowiaceae (Warnowiiden), die der Phototaxis dienen., Erworbene temporäre Organellen., Werden semiautonome Organellen aus der Beute aufgenommen, so sind diese (per Definition) nicht auf Dauer funktionsfähig. Insbesondere sind sie in der Zelle bzw. den Zellen des Räubers nicht vermehrungsfähig und müssen daher – spätestens bei dessen Vermehrung – durch die Aufnahme (Phagocytose) weiterer Beute ersetzt werden. Handelt es sich bei den Organellen um Plastiden, spricht man von Kleptoplastidie. Bei Dinoflagellaten bleiben offenbar auch die Zellkerne der Beute eine Zeit lang funktionell (Karyokleptie). Beim Wimpertierchen \\"Mesodinium rubrum\\" wurde auch die Aufnahme von Beute-Mitochondrien beobachtet., Eukaryotische Organellen ohne Membran., Eine neuere Definition setzt voraus, dass eine umgebende Membran vorhanden ist. Die ältere Bedeutung des Begriffs, die ebenfalls noch verwendet wird, kennt jedoch keine solche Voraussetzung. Nach dieser Bedeutung werden alle zellulären Strukturen, die als Organ-ähnlich angesehen werden, als Organell bezeichnet.

Sie wurde als weltweit zweite künstlich vereisbare Rodelbahn von 1969 bis 1970 erbaut und 1971 eingeweiht. Ihre Gesamtlänge beträgt nach mehreren Umbauten 1354,5 Meter bei fünfzehn Kurven (Wettkampflänge 1069,70 Meter und vierzehn Kurven). Aufgrund der hohen Geschwindigkeit und der kurzen Abfolge von engen Kurven gilt die Bahn als technisch schwierig. In den Jahren 1973, 1985 und 2008 wurden auf dieser Bahn die Rennrodel-Weltmeisterschaften ausgerichtet. Für die Weltmeisterschaften 2023 wurde die Kunsteisbahn zum vierten Mal für diese Titelkämpfe ausgewählt. Auf ihr finden Rennrodel-Weltcups statt, jedoch keine Bob- und Skeleton-Weltcups, weil die für den Bobsport nötige Anschubstrecke fehlt. Sie ist auch für den Tourismus ein Anziehungspunkt, da sie mit Gästebobs befahrbar ist. Hierbei kam es im Februar 2023 zu einem Unfall. Die Bahn wird regelmäßig von verschiedenen Nationalmannschaften einschließlich der deutschen Rennrodler und Bobfahrer als Trainingsbahn benutzt., Lage., Die Rodelbahn befindet sich etwa 1,5Kilometer nordwestlich von Oberhof am nördlichen Hang des 903,8Meter hohen Schützenbergs an den Fallbächen und an der Landesstraße128 von Oberhof nach Steinbach-Hallenberg und etwa einen Kilometer zum \\"Grenzadler\\" mit der Lotto Thüringen Arena am Rennsteig. Der Startbereich der Bahn liegt direkt an der Straße nach Steinbach-Hallenberg, der Zielbereich in der Nähe des \\"Oberen Schweizer Hofes\\", des ehemaligen Gästehauses des Politbüros der SED. In der Nähe des Zieles befindet sich die Talstation der Zweier-Seilbahn Fallbachlift, die über die Rodelbahn zur Bergstation verläuft. Die Rodelbahn liegt etwa 800Meter über Normalhöhennull und ist durch ihre zentrale Lage im Thüringer Wald im Winter relativ nebelanfällig., Beschreibung., Die Rodelbahn ist eine Sportanlage des Leistungszentrums Oberhof des Olympiastützpunktes Thüringen, des Zentrums der Wintersport-Nachwuchsförderung in Thüringen und steht Spitzen- und Nachwuchssportlern der dort stationierten Sportfördergruppe der Bundeswehr und dem Sportgymnasium zur Verfügung. Die Bahn dient Rennrodlern und Bobfahrern aus allen Ländern zum Fahrtraining und für die Durchführung von Wettbewerben. Sie wurde als reine Rennrodelbahn konzipiert und verfügt deswegen nicht über die übliche Anschubstrecke für den Bobsport. Aufgrund der kurz hintereinander liegenden engen Kurven gilt die Bahn als technisch anspruchsvoll und als eine der schwierigsten weltweit. Im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Rodelbahnen hat sie keine langen Gleitpassagen, sondern die Kurven gehen ineinander über. Seit der Eröffnung musste die Bahn mehrfach durch Umbau an die zunehmenden Geschwindigkeiten angepasst werden, indem teilweise Kurven verlagert und aufgeweitet wurden., Wettkampfmäßig wird sie nur für Rennrodeln und Skeleton genutzt. Internationale Bobrennen finden nur bei Einladungsveranstaltungen wie dem \\"Hoppe-Challenge-Cup\\" statt. Die Bahnbetreiber bieten Sommerbobfahren und im Winter Gästebobfahrten an, bei denen die Bobs von erfahrenen Bobfahrern gelenkt werden., Die Bahn wird im Oktober künstlich vereist und dann durch Kühlung bis zum Ende der Wintersportsaison erhalten. Dazu wird durch die in der Bahn verlaufenden Kühlrohre Ammoniak gepumpt, das dem Beton die Wärme entzieht. Aufgesprühtes Wasser gefriert auf dem unterkühlten Beton sofort zu Eis, das nach der Präparierung bis zum Frühjahr hält. Trainingsbetrieb findet auf der Bahn bis zu Außentemperaturen von 18 Grad Celsius statt. Seit dem Jahre 2001 hat die Rodelbahn im Zielbereich eine spezielle Startanlage, auf der die Sportler den Rodel- und Bobstart trainieren können. Die Bahn wird bei starker Sonneneinstrahlung mit Sonnensegeln abgedeckt, um das Schmelzen des Eises zu verhindern. Die Segel schützen auch vor Niederschlägen., Bahndaten., Die Rodelbahn überwindet einen Höhenunterschied von beinahe 100Metern. Der Herrenstart befindet sich auf 831,50Meter über Normalnull und das Ziel auf 735,13Meter. Das durchschnittliche Gefälle beträgt 9,2Prozent. Bei der größten Wettkampflänge sind vierzehn Kurven zu befahren. Beim letzten Umbau im Jahre 2006 wurde eine weitere Kurve 15 hinter dem Zielbereich als Auslauf angefügt. Die gefahrene Zeit wird jedoch bereits nach der Kurve 14 gemessen. Die Kurven sind mit einem Radius zwischen zwölf und etwa zwanzig Metern mit Ausnahme der Kurve 9 (Radius 30Meter) sehr eng. Auf der Bahn werden Höchstgeschwindigkeiten bis zu 120 Kilometer pro Stunde erreicht., Je nach Sportart und Geschlecht gibt es mehrere Startpositionen. Das oberste Starthäuschen, der Herrenstart, wird für Rodeln, Skeleton und Bob benutzt. Bahnabwärts folgt vor Kurve 4 der Damenstart. Dieser dient dem Rodeln und Skeleton der Frauen und dem Männerdoppel. Der Juniorenstart mündet bei Kurve 8 in die Bahn, der Pionierstart für die jüngsten Fahrer vor Kurve 12. Die Rodelbahn hat seit ihrem letzten Umbau im Jahre 2006 eine Gesamtlänge von 1354,50Metern, wobei die maximale Wettkampflänge (Herrenstart) 1069,70Meter beträgt. Beim Damenstart beträgt die Wettkampflänge 945,60Meter. Zwischen den beiden Umbauphasen 1996 und 2006 betrug die Gesamtlänge der Bahn 1235,00Meter bei einer Wettkampflänge beim Herrenstart von 1063,50, beim Damenstart von 930,40 und beim Jugendstart von 665,40Metern. Von der Eröffnung 1971 bis zum ersten Umbau 1996 war die Gesamtlänge der Bahn 1113,11 Meter (Wettkampflänge vom Herrenstart 1032,89Meter und vom Damenstart 930,40Meter)., Die Startanlage für den Bob-Start ist insgesamt 117Meter lang, die Anfahrtsstrecke hat eine Länge von 32Metern mit einem Gefälle von zwei Prozent. Das Mittelstück ist 40Meter lang und hat ein Gefälle von sieben Prozent, der Auslauf ist 45Meter lang bei einer Steigung von 20Prozent. Für das Rennrodeln beträgt die Gesamtlänge 77Meter, die Anfahrtsstrecke ist 16,25Meter lang bei einem Gefälle von 26,8Prozent. Das 15Meter lange Mittelstück hat kein Gefälle, der Auslauf ist 42Meter lang bei einer Steigung von sieben Prozent., Liste der Rekorde., Die Bahn wurde 1996, 2006 und 2020 bis 2022 umgebaut, wobei sich jeweils die Bahnlänge änderte. Nach jedem Umbau gab es neue Bahnrekorde. Aufgeführt ist auch der erste Bahnrekord. Eine weitere Liste nennt die Startrekorde., Geschichte., In Oberhof gab es bereits 1905 die erste Bobbahn. Die Wadebergbobbahn wurde im Jahre 1908 mit einer Länge von 1908Metern, einem maximalen Gefälle von zwölf Prozent und einem durchschnittlichen Gefälle von neun Prozent in Betrieb genommen. Die Bahn hatte als erste in Deutschland einen elektrischen Schlitten- und Personenaufzug und eine elektrische Zeitnahme. Im Laufe der Zeit wurden in Oberhof mehrere Rodel- und Bobbahnen gebaut, so dass die Bahnen gleichzeitig von verschiedenen Vereinen genutzt werden konnten. Oberhof war das Zentrum im Renn- und Bobsport in Deutschland. Auf der Wadebergbobbahn fanden im Jahre 1931 die Bobweltmeisterschaften im Zweierbob statt. Die Rennen auf dieser Bahn, wie zum Beispiel zahlreiche Deutsche Meisterschaften, zogen teilweise bis zu 40.000Besucher an., Planung., Ende der 1960er Jahre war die Bobbahn am Wadeberg nicht mehr zeitgemäß, die anderen Bahnen waren bereits früher stillgelegt worden. Die Vorbereitung der Bahn war in jedem Winter mit einem hohen Aufwand verbunden. Wärmeeinbrüche über einen längeren Zeitraum verhinderten häufig die Durchführung geplanter Wettbewerbe. Damit haben alle Bahnen der Welt Probleme, wenn sie nicht, wie beispielsweise St. Moritz, auf großer Höhe liegen. Im Berchtesgadener Land am Königssee wurde 1969 mit der Kunsteisbahn Königssee die erste künstlich zu vereisende Rodelbahn der Welt errichtet. In Oberhof reiften Pläne, auch dort eine Bahn künstlich zu vereisen, um sie wetterunabhängig zu machen. Am 8.April 1969 beschloss das Politbüro des Zentralkomitees der Sozialistischen Einheitspartei Deutschlands (SED) die Entwicklung des Leistungssports bis zu den Olympischen Winterspielen 1972 in Sapporo in allen Sportarten. Um den Sportlern bestmögliche Trainingsbedingungen für das bevorstehende Großereignis zu bieten, wurde der Bau einer Kunsteisbahn beschlossen. Vorgesehen waren eine natürlich zu vereisende Rennschlittenbahn in Oberwiesenthal und eine künstlich zu vereisende Bahn in Oberhof, dem Zentrum des Wintersports in der DDR. Hierbei spielten die Kosten nur eine untergeordnete Rolle., Mit der Planung des Bahnverlaufs und der Berechnung der Kurvengeometrie war ab 1968 die Staatliche Projektierung Sportbauten mit Sitz in Leipzig betraut., Das Stuttgarter Planungsbüro Deyle, das bereits die Bahn am Königssee projektiert hatte, begann mit den Planungsarbeiten für das Kältesystem in der Bahnschale im Jahre 1969. Als Bauleiter fungierte der Bauingenieur Dieter Schmidt aus Schmiedefeld am Rennsteig, der bereits zehn Jahre vorher beim Bau der Hans-Renner-Schanze im Kanzlersgrund tätig gewesen war. Ihm oblag es auch, den Standort für die neue Bahn zu suchen. Es gab erste Überlegungen, sie parallel zur alten Wadebergbobbahn zu bauen. Dieser Standort wurde allerdings wegen der ungünstigen Südhanglage verworfen. Weitere mögliche Standorte waren das Pfanntal, der Kanzlersgrund, dort als zusätzliches Bauwerk zur Sprungschanze, und an den Fallbächen. Letzterer setzte sich schließlich durch. Dort kam unterstützend hinzu, dass ein vorhandener Wanderweg den Verlauf der Bahn schon vorgab. Probleme gab es, weil der vorgesehene Standort im Einzugsgebiet der Ohra-Talsperre lag. Schließlich kam es zur Einigung zwischen der Sportführung der DDR, den Naturschützern und den Wasserwirtschaftlern., Bau., Das Straßen- und Tiefbaukombinat aus Suhl begann im Mai 1970 mit den Erdarbeiten. Die Planungen hatte das \\"Wissenschaftlich-Technische Zentrum für Sportbauten (WTZ)\\" Leipzig vom Planungsbüro Deyle übernommen. Jugoslawische Firmen, die vorher die Hotels \\"Panorama\\" und \\"Rennsteig\\" gebaut hatten, übernahmen die Betonarbeiten. Die Einschalung der Kurven bereitete den Bauarbeitern Probleme, da sie es bisher nur mit geraden Flächen zu tun hatten.

Die Beförderung mittels Luftpost erfolgt zum Teil nur gegen eine Entrichtung erhöhter Postgebühren, die früher mitunter durch Freimachung mit besonderen Luftpostwertzeichen eingezogen wurden. Die wissenschaftliche Auseinandersetzung mit der Luftpostgeschichte sowie das systematische Sammeln von Luftpostwertzeichen und Belegstücken heißt Aerophilatelie., Historische Entwicklung., Die Anfänge der Luftpost., Bereits im Altertum wurden Botschaften mittels \\"Flugpost\\" überbracht, indem Brieftauben als Überbringer von Nachrichten eingesetzt wurden. Erstmals wurden Tauben im Alten Ägypten zur Nachrichtenüberbringung eingesetzt. Dieser besonders schnellen Art der Überbringung von Botschaften wurde militärische, politische und auch wirtschaftliche Beachtung beigemessen. Im Jahre 1279 v. Chr. wurde die Kunde von der Krönung des ägyptischen Pharaos Ramses II. durch vier freigelassene Tauben verbreitet. Brieftauben wurden auch von anderen Hochkulturen verwendet. Der römische Feldherr Julius Caesar bediente sich der besonderen Fähigkeiten der Brieftaube. Er ließ Nachrichten von Unruhen im eroberten Gallien durch eigene \\"Botentauben\\" überbringen, um so schnell wie möglich seine Truppen befehligen zu können., Auch im Mittelalter wurde die Brieftaube als Nachrichtenüberbringer eingesetzt. Der Kalif von Bagdad, \\"Nur-Eddin\\", richtete seine eigene \\"Brieftaubenpost\\" ein. Sie wurde allerdings nach der Zerstörung Bagdads im Jahre 1258 durch die Mongolen wieder eingestellt. Auch ägyptische Sultane richteten im Mittelalter eine eigene \\"staatliche Taubenpost\\" ein. Kreuzritter führten Brieftauben im 12. und 13. Jahrhundert aus dem Vorderen Orient erneut nach Europa ein., Die ersten Flugmaschinen., Zur Zeit der Renaissance tauchten in Europa die ersten ernstzunehmenden Entwürfe von Flugmaschinen auf. Die bekanntesten stammen vom italienischen Universalgenie Leonardo da Vinci. Die ersten flugtauglichen Konstruktionen entstanden jedoch erst über 250Jahre später. Die Brüder Montgolfier entdeckten durch einen Zufall, dass heiße Luft stark genug ist, um eine Papiertüte in die Luft zu heben. Diese Entdeckung war die Grundlage der Entwicklung des ersten Heißluftballons, der Montgolfière. Am 21. November 1783 fand die erste Fahrt eines Menschen mit einem Heißluftballon statt., Die Erfindung des Heißluftballons hatte große Auswirkungen auf die Geschichte der Luftpost. Bereits ein Jahr nach der ersten bemannten Ballonfahrt nahmen die Piloten kleinere Nachrichten oder Mitteilungen auf ihre Fahrten mit. Jedoch kam es erst im Jahre 1793 zum eigentlichen Beginn der Ballonpostgeschichte. Aus den beiden belagerten Festungen Valenciennes und Condé in Frankreich wurden mit kleinen Ballons Mitteilungen für die Verbündeten der Eingeschlossenen aufgelassen. Diese Nachrichten wurden allerdings von den Feinden abgefangen. In den folgenden Jahrzehnten kam es zur weiteren Anwendungen von Ballons zur Nachrichtenübermittlung im Krieg., Das berühmteste Beispiel unter Philatelisten aller Welt ist die Pariser Ballonpost. Die Verbindung zwischen Paris und dem unbesetzten Frankreich während des Deutsch-Französischen Krieges in den Jahren 1870 und 1871 konnte nur durch ein geschicktes Zusammenspiel zwischen Ballonpost und Brieftauben aufrechterhalten werden. Man gab den Ballonen aus Paris neben 2.500.000 Briefen und Postkarten insgesamt 363 Brieftauben mit, damit diese später mit Antworten oder anderen Nachrichten zurückkehren konnten. In Metz kam es ebenfalls während des Deutsch-Französischen Krieges zu ähnlichen Versuchen, mit Ballonen Verbündeten Nachrichten zukommen zu lassen (vergleiche Metzer Ballonpost)., Der erste amtliche Ballonpostflug fand am 17. Juli 1859 in den USA statt. Dieser führte von St. Louis in das 1290km entfernte Henderson in New York. Der Pilot John Wise hatte 123 Briefe an Bord. Nur einer dieser posthistorischen Belege ist erhalten geblieben. In Deutschland fand der erste amtliche Ballonpostflug im Rahmen der Leipziger Gewerbeausstellung im Juni 1897 statt. Der Pilot \\"Louis Godard\\" übergab die beförderten Postkarten nach der Landung der Reichspost zur Weiterbeförderung. Die Karten erhielten private Bestätigungsstempel., Bis zum Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts fanden solche Luftpostbeförderungen immer im Rahmen von besonderen Veranstaltungen oder aus militärischen Gründen statt. Der deutsche Generalpostmeister Heinrich von Stephan wies jedoch in einem vielbeachteten Vortrag auf die mögliche Bedeutung der Luftpost für die alltägliche Postbeförderung im Jahre 1874 hin. Dieser Vortrag erschien sogar als Buch unter dem Titel \\"„Weltpost und Luftschifffahrt“\\"., Die Erfindung des Flugzeugs., Nichts hatte größere Auswirkungen auf die Geschichte der Luftpost als die Erfindung des Flugzeugs. Nach den ersten Flugversuchen Otto Lilienthals mit seinem Derwitzer Gleiter im Frühjahr 1891 fand am 17. Dezember 1903 der erste motorisierte Flug der Welt (Brüder Wright) statt. Fünf Jahre später kam es zu der ersten Beförderung von Postsendungen durch Flugzeuge: Am 12. August 1909 wurden im Rahmen einer Flugausstellung Sonderstempel für einen Rundflug über Mailand ausgegeben. Einen Monat später, am 20. September 1909, wurden anlässlich eines Rundflugs über die italienische Stadt Brescia mitgeflogene Belege mit einem ähnlichen Sonderstempel versehen. Bei diesen beiden Veranstaltungen wurden die Postsendungen jedoch nicht weiterbefördert., Der erste offizielle Postbeförderungsflug zwischen zwei Orten fand am 18. Februar 1911 während einer Kunst- und Gewerbeausstellung in Indien statt. Der junge französische Pilot Henri Pequet transportierte etwa 6500 Briefe vom Ausstellungsort Allahabad in das etwa acht Kilometer entfernte Naini. Henri Pequet benötigte für diese Strecke mit seinem Doppeldecker \\"Sommer\\" ungefähr 13Minuten. Die mitgeflogenen Belege wurden mit dem Bestätigungsstempel \\"First Aerial Post, U.P. Exhibition Allahabad 1911\\" versehen., In England wurde der erste regelmäßige Luftpostdienst am 9. September 1911 zwischen Hendon und Windsor aufgenommen., Ein Jahr später, am 19. Mai 1912, fand der erste offizielle Postflug der Deutschen Reichspost zwischen Mannheim und Heidelberg statt (allerdings wurde die meiste Post nicht, wie vorgesehen, mit dem Luftschiff, sondern auf dem herkömmlichen Wege befördert). Mit Genehmigung des Reichs-Postamtes vom 1.Juni 1912 wurde dann vom 10. bis 23. Juni 1912 im Rahmen einer Wohltätigkeitsveranstaltung eine Luftpostbeförderung mit Zeppelin und Flugzeug und halbamtlichen Flugpostmarken, der sogenannten Flugpost am Rhein und am Main genehmigt. Zuvor gab es in Deutschland bereits mehrere private Postbeförderungen mit Flugzeugen ohne Genehmigung der Post. Die erste Veranstaltung dieser Art wurde am 13. November 1911 in Berlin durchgeführt., Bei der Veranstaltung \\"Flug um Berlin\\" wurden Postkarten für Sammler auf den Flug mitgenommen. Die zweite Veranstaltung dieser Art war ein Flug über acht Kilometer zwischen den Orten Bork und Brück. Bei dieser Flugveranstaltung wurden erstmals Flugmarken ausgegeben. Sie dienten ausschließlich zur Finanzierung der Veranstaltung und hatten keinen postalischen Wert. Der Initiator der Aktion waren der Berliner Zahnarzt und Vorsitzende des Verkehrsvereins Borkheide Kurt Schaefer und sein Freund Hans Grade, der als Unternehmer die ersten Flugzeuge zu dieser Zeit produzierte. So startete am 18. Februar 1912 ein Grade-Flugzeug und bewerkstelligte damit die erste Flugpostbeförderung mit Flugmarken in Deutschland von Bork nach Brück. In Aleksandar Lifkas \\"Kinematographischem Bericht der Ereignisse der letzten Woche\\" wurde über diese Luftpostbeförderung unter dem Titel \\"Die erste deutsche Luftpost zwischen Bork und Brück\\" berichtet; der Film wurde auch in österreichischen Kinos aufgeführt., Der Schweizer Flugpionier Oskar Bider transportierte am 9.März 1913 die erste schweizerische Luftpost auf der Strecke Basel–Liestal., In den folgenden Jahren gab es bis zum Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkrieges eine intensive Zusammenarbeit der Reichspost mit den Veranstaltern der Postflüge (siehe zum Beispiel \\"Flugpost am Rhein und am Main\\"). In anderen Ländern wurde jedoch selbst während des Krieges am Aufbau eines zivilen Luftpostnetzwerkes gearbeitet. In Italien wurden 1917 die ersten Flugpostmarken der Welt ausgegeben. Diese wurden zur Bezahlung der Postgebühren für die Beförderung per Luftpost auf den Strecken Turin–Rom und Rom–Palermo verwendet. Dabei handelte es sich noch um einen Probebetrieb. In Österreich wurde am 31. März 1918 die erste regelmäßige Flugpostlinie zwischen Wien, Krakau, Lemberg und Kiew eingerichtet. Dafür wurden ebenfalls eigene Flugpostmarken ausgegeben. Diese regelmäßige Postbeförderung durch Flugzeuge wird von vielen Philatelisten als eigentlicher Beginn der Flugpostgeschichte angesehen. Aber auch während des Ersten Weltkrieges wurde versucht eine \\"Militärflugpost\\" aufzubauen, die das Ziel verfolgte eingeschlossene Soldaten mit Informationen aus der Heimat zu versorgen. So kann man als erste Militärflugpost den Flug von österreichisch-ungarischen Fliegern zu den Soldaten in das durch die Russen umschlossene Przemyśl im Oktober 1914 bezeichnen., Die ersten regelmäßigen staatlichen Flugpostverbindungen unter deutscher Regie wurden gegen Ende des Ersten Weltkrieges an der Ostfront in Russland und im Baltikum eingerichtet. Die Geschichte der zivilen Luftpost in Deutschland begann am 6.Februar 1919. Der Anlass war die Eröffnung der Konstituierung der Nationalversammlung in Weimar. Von diesem Tag an starteten zweimal täglich Flugzeuge der Deutschen Luft-Reederei in Berlin-Johannisthal, um Postsendungen – vor allem Zeitungen – von der Hauptstadt zum Tagungsort in Weimar zu transportieren. Diese Flugpostverbindung konnte vorerst ausschließlich von den Abgeordneten der Nationalversammlung in Anspruch genommen werden, die wegen der revolutionären Lage in Berlin in die damalige thüringische Hauptstadt ausgewichen war. Wenige Monate später wurde diese Flugpostlinie auch für die Öffentlichkeit freigegeben., Im März 1919 richteten dann die Junkers-Flugzeugwerke in Dessau den regelmäßigen Flugdienst nach Weimar ein. Im gleichen Jahr wurde auch in Bayern regelmäßige Postflüge eingerichtet., In den folgenden Jahren fand ein rascher Ausbau des Flugpostverbindungen in Deutschland wie auch in ganz Westeuropa und den USA statt. Am 11. August 1920 wurden die ersten Flugpostflüge von Deutschland ins Ausland durchgeführt. Das angeflogene Ziel war die schwedische Hafenstadt Malmö., Ab dem Jahr 1921 führte die Deutsche Reichspost besondere Flugpostbestätigungsstempel und Flugpostklebezettel ein. Im Jahre 1922 bestanden bereits 13 verschiedene Luftpostlinien. Im Mai 1923 wurden in Berlin die ersten Luftpostbriefkästen Deutschlands aufgestellt.

Jahrhundert v. Chr., Gestorben im 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr., Grieche (Antike), Literatur (Altgriechisch), Literatur (Sizilien), Literatur der Antike, Mann, Mediziner der griechischen Antike], Empedokles (; * um 495 v. Chr. in Akragas, dem heutigen Agrigent auf Sizilien; † um 435 v. Chr. wohl auf der Peloponnes), genannt auch Empedokles von Agrigent, war ein antiker griechischer Philosoph, Naturforscher, Politiker, Redner und Dichter. Unklar ist, ob die Behauptungen zutreffen, wonach er sich auch als Arzt, Magier und Wahrsager betätigte. Zahlreiche Geschichten über sein Leben und seinen Tod tragen legendenhafte Züge. Als Politiker war er in seiner Heimatstadt Akragas umstritten und musste ins Exil gehen, aus dem er nicht mehr zurückkehrte., Als Vorsokratiker war Empedokles vom Gedankengut bedeutender Strömungen seiner Zeit, der Pythagoreer und der Eleaten, beeinflusst, konzipierte aber ein eigenständiges Weltmodell. Seine Philosophie ist in seinen beiden nur fragmentarisch erhaltenen Gedichten – dem Lehrgedicht „Über die Natur“ und den „Reinigungen“ – dargelegt. Wie bei den vorsokratischen Naturphilosophen üblich, befasste er sich mit der Frage der Weltentstehung (Kosmogonie) und versuchte, die Ordnung und Beschaffenheit des Weltalls zu klären (Kosmologie). In diesem Zusammenhang entwickelte er eine von mythischem Denken geprägte physikalische und biologische Theorie, zu der auch eine Vorstellung von der Entstehung des Lebens auf der Erde und der Evolution der Lebewesen gehörte. Er führte die Lehre von den vier Urstoffen (bzw. „Elementen“) Luft, Feuer, Erde und Wasser ein. Diese Vier-Elemente-Lehre wurde für das naturwissenschaftliche Weltbild der Antike maßgeblich, steht am Anfang chemischen und chemisch-biologischen Denkens und beeinflusste bis ins 19. Jahrhundert auch die Medizin., Eine zentrale Rolle spielen in seiner Philosophie ethische und religiöse Überzeugungen, die eng mit seiner Lehre von der Reinkarnation verknüpft sind; im Mittelpunkt steht die Forderung nach Gewaltlosigkeit. Die Legende von seinem Tod im Vulkan Ätna beschäftigte die Fantasie der Nachwelt bis in die Moderne., Quellen., Die Hauptquelle für das Leben des Empedokles ist das ihm gewidmete Kapitel im achten Buch der Philosophenbiografien des Doxographen Diogenes Laertios. Diogenes beruft sich für seine Angaben über Empedokles auf 22 heute verlorene Schriften verschiedener Autoren, die ihm aber möglicherweise zum Teil nur aus Zitaten in späterer Literatur bekannt waren. Seinen Quellen entnahm er insbesondere anekdotisches Material., Die überlieferten Geschichten dienen großenteils der mitunter drastischen Veranschaulichung von angeblichen oder tatsächlichen Charakterzügen oder Fähigkeiten des Philosophen. Manche Anekdoten sind unglaubwürdig, viele wirken zumindest sagenhaft ausgeschmückt. Manchmal ist – wie bei Heraklit – erkennbar, dass der Urheber einer Behauptung oder Geschichte beabsichtigte, den Philosophen lächerlich zu machen. Einige Angaben über Empedokles’ Leben sind möglicherweise aus einer biografischen Interpretation von Stellen in seiner Dichtung entstanden. Tatsächlich können einzelne Bemerkungen des Dichters einen autobiografischen Hintergrund haben, doch ist bei derartigen Folgerungen Vorsicht geboten. Generell ist die Glaubwürdigkeit der Überlieferung umstritten., Da die Lehrdichtung des Empedokles nur bruchstückhaft erhalten ist, sind auch Werke anderer Autoren wichtige Quellen für seine Lehre. Eine Reihe von Informationen liefern Aristoteles und Plutarch sowie Aristoteles-Kommentatoren (insbesondere Simplikios). Plutarchs umfangreiche Monographie über Empedokles ist bis auf ein Fragment verloren, doch äußert er sich auch in seinen erhaltenen Schriften über den Vorsokratiker und zitiert ihn., Leben und Wirken., Die Geburt des Empedokles lässt sich nur ungefähr datieren; da er etwas jünger war als sein Zeitgenosse Anaxagoras, fällt sie wohl in die ersten Jahre des 5. Jahrhunderts. Er stammte aus einer vornehmen und reichen Familie seiner Heimatstadt Akragas. Sein Großvater, der ebenfalls Empedokles hieß, war Pferdezüchter und Sieger bei den Olympischen Spielen von 496. Sein Vater Meton war ein prominenter Politiker. Nach dem Tode des um 472 v. Chr. gestorbenen Tyrannen Theron begannen in Akragas unruhige Zeiten. Der Nachfolger des Tyrannen, sein Sohn Thrasydaios, musste nach nur einjähriger Herrschaft ins Exil gehen. Bei dieser politischen Neuorientierung der Stadt spielte Meton auf der Seite der Tyrannengegner eine führende Rolle. Angeblich wurde Empedokles die Königswürde angeboten, die er jedoch ablehnte. Sicher ist, dass sich die Idee einer demokratischen Staatsordnung durchsetzte. Empedokles engagierte sich auf der Seite der Demokratiebefürworter und trat energisch gegen Bestrebungen auf, die nach seiner Einschätzung auf eine Tyrannenherrschaft abzielten. Er erreichte die Auflösung einer Organisation, die als „Versammlung der Tausend“ bezeichnet wurde und wohl oligarchische Ziele verfolgte. Eine von Diogenes Laertios mitgeteilte Anekdote über Todesurteile, die er veranlasst haben soll, ist allerdings unglaubwürdig; es handelt sich wohl um eine Erfindung eines Komödiendichters. Anscheinend war Empedokles ein begabter Redner, Aristoteles bezeichnete ihn sogar als Erfinder der Rhetorik., Empedokles’ Verhältnis zu älteren und zeitgenössischen Philosophen ist schwer zu bestimmen. In der Antike galt er als Schüler des Pythagoras oder von frühen Pythagoreern. Diese Annahme war wegen der Verwandtschaft seiner Lehre mit pythagoreischem Gedankengut naheliegend. Ein direktes Schülerverhältnis zu Pythagoras ist allerdings aus chronologischem Grund ausgeschlossen. Außerdem bezeichnet ihn eine antike Überlieferung als Schüler des Parmenides, dessen Lehre ihn jedenfalls beeinflusst hat., Der biografischen Überlieferung zufolge war Empedokles auch ein erfolgreicher Arzt. Er soll eine Scheintote geheilt haben, die von ihren Ärzten bereits aufgegeben worden war. Ob in dieser legendenhaft ausgeschmückten Geschichte von einer spektakulären Heilung ein historischer Kern steckt, ist unklar. Dass Empedokles Gesundheitsberatung erteilte, erwähnt er selbst. In einer Aufzählung der vier vornehmsten Berufe nennt er die Ärzte neben Weissagern, Dichtern und Fürsten; das ist möglicherweise ein Indiz dafür, dass er den Arztberuf selbst ausgeübt hat. Dazu passt auch sein ausgeprägtes Interesse an biologischen Themen., Wegen eines politischen Konflikts hielt sich Empedokles im Exil auf; als er nach Akragas zurückkehren wollte, verhinderten dies mächtige Gegner. Der von Diogenes Laertios zitierte Geschichtsschreiber Timaios von Tauromenion berichtet, der Philosoph sei nach Griechenland ausgewandert und habe sich auf der Peloponnes niedergelassen; von dort sei er nicht mehr zurückgekehrt. Mit Berufung auf Aristoteles und Herakleides Pontikos schreibt Diogenes, Empedokles sei sechzig Jahre alt geworden; daraus folgt, dass sein Tod wohl um die Mitte der dreißiger Jahre des 5. Jahrhunderts zu datieren ist. Die Todesumstände sind unbekannt., Von Empedokles sind keine Bildnisse erhalten. Diogenes Laertios berichtet von einer Statue des Philosophen in Akragas, die später in Rom aufgestellt worden sei, sowie von Gemälden., Selbstbild., Sehr ungewöhnlich ist Empedokles’ außerordentliches stark entwickeltes Selbstbewusstsein, das in seinen Versen drastisch zum Ausdruck kommt. Der Ich-Sprecher in seiner Dichtung nimmt die Haltung eines unfehlbaren Weisheitslehrers ein, verkündet seinen eigenen Ruhm und schreibt sich übermenschliche Fähigkeiten zu. Einer gängigen Interpretation zufolge nimmt er an einer Stelle sogar ausdrücklich Göttlichkeit für sich in Anspruch. Dies erregte schon in der Antike Aufsehen und Anstoß und trug dem Dichter den Vorwurf der Arroganz und Scharlatanerie ein. Auch in der Neuzeit hat die Annahme, er habe sich für einen Gott gehalten, die Empedokles-Rezeption stark beeinflusst. Allerdings ist nicht sicher, dass die in diesem Zusammenhang zitierten Verse als Selbstbeschreibung des Dichters gemeint waren. Nach einer alternativen Deutung der Verse wird die Göttlichkeit nicht als Tatsache behauptet, sondern nur als Eindruck erwähnt, den die Umwelt erhielt., Werke., Empedokles schrieb eine Anzahl von Werken, die großenteils verloren sind. Erhalten sind Fragmente seiner beiden bekanntesten Dichtungen, des philosophischen Lehrgedichts „Über die Natur“ und der „Reinigungen“ \\"(Katharmoí)\\", die beide in Hexametern abgefasst waren. Die überlieferten Bezeichnungen des Naturgedichts – „Über die Natur“ \\"(Peri phýseōs)\\", „Über die Natur des Seienden“ \\"(Peri phýseōs tōn óntōn)\\" oder „Physik“ \\"(Physiká)\\" – waren ursprünglich nur Angaben des Themas; sie waren nicht als Werktitel im später geläufigen Sinne gemeint, denn vom Verfasser verbindlich festgelegte Titel philosophischer Werke waren damals noch nicht üblich. Die herkömmliche, weiterhin vorherrschende Lehrmeinung lautet, dass das Naturgedicht und die „Reinigungen“ zwei unterschiedliche Werke sind, von denen das eine in erster Linie die Naturphilosophie behandelt, das andere primär einem religiösen Zweck dient. Seit 1987 wird in der Forschung aber auch die Ansicht vertreten, es handle sich um nur ein Werk. Ausdrücklich bezeugt ist die Existenz zweier verschiedener Gedichte nur bei Diogenes Laertios. Die Hypothese, wonach es sich um ein einziges Gedicht handelt, hat sich aber nicht durchsetzen können., Den Gesamtumfang der beiden Gedichte gibt Diogenes Laertios mit rund 5000 Versen an. Erhalten sind insgesamt etwa 500 Verse; sie sind größtenteils nur aus Zitaten in späterer antiker Literatur bekannt, doch sind darunter auch einige Dutzend Verse bzw. Versteile aus dem ersten Buch des Naturgedichts, die nur im Straßburger Empedokles-Papyrus stehen. Bei diesem aus dem späten 1. Jahrhundert stammenden Papyrus handelt es sich um 52 Bruchstücke einer Papyrusrolle, die als Unterlage eines aufgeklebten Schmuckkragens aus Kupferblech dienten. Der Kragen wurde schon 1904 von dem Archäologen Otto Rubensohn erworben, aber erst 1992 sind die Papyrus-Bruchstücke als Teil von Empedokles’ Werk identifiziert worden., Die Verteilung der erhaltenen Fragmente auf die beiden großen Gedichte ist teils gesichert, teils hypothetisch.

Bis 2010 wurden jeweils drei Rodelwettbewerbe – Einsitzer der Männer und Frauen sowie Doppelsitzer – ausgetragen. 2014 kam mit der Teamstaffel ein vierter Wettbewerb hinzu. Bisher starteten bei Olympischen Spielen nur Männer im Doppelsitzer, obwohl das Reglement Frauen von diesem Wettbewerb nicht ausschließt., Erste, nicht erfolgreiche Bemühungen, Rodeln ins olympische Programm aufzunehmen, gab es bereits in den 1930er-Jahren. Das Internationale Olympische Komitee stimmte 1954 einem solchen Antrag zu, zehn Jahre später war die Disziplin erstmals olympisch. In den Anfangsjahren traten mehrere Schwierigkeiten auf, etwa die Wetteranfälligkeit der Sportart und die damit verbundenen häufigen Verschiebungen. Dieses Problem löste sich, als die olympischen Rodelwettkämpfe im Jahr 1976 zum ersten Mal auf Kunsteis stattfinden konnten. Ein weiteres Merkmal der Anfangsjahre waren Experimente mit neuen Techniken und mit dem Material, die ein immer genauer werdendes Reglement jedoch im Laufe der Zeit einschränkte. Sportlich bildeten bei fast allen Spielen das DDR-Team (bis 1988) beziehungsweise das gesamtdeutsche Team (ab 1992) die stärkste Mannschaft: Insgesamt gewannen deutsche Sportler bis 2022 37 der 51 Wettkämpfe und 86 von 150 vergebenen Medaillen., Eine Übersicht über alle Medaillengewinner sowie eine genaue statistische Aufschlüsselung der Ergebnisse findet sich in der Liste der Olympiasieger im Rennrodeln., Wettbewerbe., Hinweis: Im Doppelsitzer sind bisher nur Männer gestartet, obwohl nach dem Reglement auch Frauen startberechtigt wären., Reglement., Die Rennrodelwettbewerbe bei Olympischen Winterspielen werden von dem internationalen Rennrodeldachverband, der Fédération Internationale de Luge (FIL), organisiert. Daher gilt auch für Olympia wie für alle FIL-Wettbewerbe die Internationale Rennrodelordnung (IRO). In dieser ist unter anderem die Anzahl der teilnahmeberechtigten Athleten eines Landes festgeschrieben – jeweils drei Sportler in den Einsitzerwettbewerben sowie zwei Paare im Doppelsitzer; außerdem werden in dem Dokument der Grundaufbau eines Rennrodelschlittens sowie die Verwendung von Zusatzgewichten geregelt. Neben diesen allgemeinen Bestimmungen existieren spezielle olympische Regeln, die zusätzlich zu der IRO bei Olympischen Winterspielen gültig sind. Diese olympischen Regeln bestimmen beispielsweise die Startreihenfolge, die sich in jedem Lauf ändert. Während sie sich in den ersten beiden Durchgängen der Einsitzerwettbewerbe (beziehungsweise im ersten Durchgang des Doppelsitzerrennens) an den Startnummern orientiert, eröffnet im dritten Lauf der Bestplatzierte den Wettkampf und der Letztplatzierte startet zum Schluss. Im abschließenden Durchgang kehrt sich diese Reihenfolge ein weiteres Mal um, sodass die am weitesten vorne liegenden Rodler das Rennen beschließen. Für die Nominierung der Teilnehmer sind die Nationalen Olympischen Komitees verantwortlich; diese dürfen jedoch nur Sportler berufen, die allgemein zu FIL-Wettbewerben zugelassen sind. Damit können nur Rodler an Olympischen Spielen teilnehmen, die einen Rennrodellehrgang abgeschlossen und die im Training ein vorher festgesetztes Zeitlimit erreicht haben., Zudem erklärt die FIL, dass sie selbst – und nicht das jeweilige Organisationskomitee – das oberste Organ der olympischen Wettbewerbe darstellt. Daher müssen alle Programmvorschläge der Veranstalter von der FIL genehmigt werden; die Organisatoren sind außerdem verpflichtet, von der FIL geforderte Änderungen umzusetzen., Historische Entwicklung., Der Weg zur olympischen Premiere (bis 1964)., Der erste internationale Rodelwettkampf fand im Jahr 1883 in der Schweiz statt. In den folgenden Jahrzehnten entwickelte sich das Rodeln von einer ursprünglich auf die Alpenländer begrenzten Sportart zu einer international anerkannten Disziplin mit eigenen Länderverbänden. Auf die 1914 ausgetragenen ersten Europameisterschaften folgte etwa zehn Jahre später die Gründung der Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT), die mehrere Jahrzehnte lang auch für den Rodelsport zuständig war. Schon in den frühen 1930er-Jahren stellten die ersten nationalen Verbände die Forderung auf, Rodeln – wie schon Bobsport und Skeleton – in das olympische Programm aufzunehmen. Den ersten Antrag an das Internationale Olympische Komitee (IOK) mit diesem Anliegen stellte die Rodelsektion der FIBT im Februar 1935. Da bis zu den nächsten Olympischen Spielen lediglich ein Jahr verblieb, lehnte die IOK-Versammlung die Bitte auf die kurzfristige Aufnahme ab. Mit dem Ausbruch des Zweiten Weltkriegs im Jahr 1939, durch den sowohl der internationale Rodelsport als auch die regelmäßige Austragung der Olympischen Spiele zum Erliegen kam, wurde das gesamte Anliegen zunächst hinfällig., Nachdem bereits seit 1951 wieder Europameisterschaften stattfanden, griffen zu Beginn der 1950er-Jahre einige Rodelfunktionäre erneut die Idee auf, beim IOK die Aufnahme der Sportart ins olympische Programm zu beantragen. Bevor dieses Gesuch offiziell der IOK-Session, dem eigentlichen Entscheidungsgremium, vorgelegt werden konnte, musste es diverse Instanzen durchlaufen. Zunächst unterzeichneten die Führer von sechs Nationalverbänden – darunter auch die früheren Europameister Paul Aste für Österreich sowie Rudolf Maschke für Deutschland – im Januar 1952 einen Brief an den Kongress der FIBT, der besonders die Popularität und weite Verbreitung der Disziplin hervorhob. Da der Rodelsport zu jener Zeit noch keinen eigenen Dachverband hatte, mussten sämtliche Anträge an das IOK über die FIBT weitergeleitet werden. Deren Präsident trug das Anliegen kurze Zeit darauf einer Unterkommission des IOK vor, die den Vorschlag annahm und ankündigte, ihn im Mai 1954 auf der IOK-Sitzung in Athen vorzustellen. In den zwei Jahren, die zwischen Einreichung und Entscheidung des Antrags lagen, beobachteten Vertreter des Komitees mehrmals Rodelveranstaltungen (wie etwa die kontinentalen Wettkämpfe 1952 in Garmisch) und zeigten sich anschließend meist von der Sportart überzeugt., Am 13. Mai 1954 legte das IOK auf seiner 50. Session fest, dass Rodeln im Programm der Olympischen Winterspiele den Skeletonsport ersetzen sollte. Letzterer war 1928 und 1948 bei den Spielen in St. Moritz olympisch gewesen, der Stadt, die mit dem Cresta-Sport das „Mekka“ und Zentrum der Sportart war. An den Wettkämpfen hatten jedoch nur 10 und 15 Athleten teilgenommen. Hingegen regelte die Versammlung noch nicht, wann der Rodelsport seine olympische Premiere feiern sollte. Da Innsbruck zunächst als Favorit für die Ausrichtung der Olympischen Winterspiele 1960 galt und Österreich in dieser Zeit eine der erfolgreichsten Rodelnationen darstellte, bestand der Plan, die Disziplin bei diesen Spielen debütieren zu lassen. Als jedoch im Mai 1955 die Winterspiele 1960 überraschend an das US-amerikanische Squaw Valley vergeben wurden, entschieden die dortigen Organisatoren, auf den Bau einer Bob- und Rodelbahn zu verzichten, da sich nicht genügend Teilnehmer gefunden hatten. Somit verschob sich die Olympiapremiere des Rennrodelns um mindestens vier weitere Jahre., In dieser Zeit entwickelte sich die Sportart erheblich weiter. Im Januar 1954, vier Monate vor der olympischen Versammlung in Athen, entschieden die Mitglieder der FIBT-Rodelsektion, sich von der Bobvereinigung zu lösen und einen eigenen Dachverband aufzubauen. Es dauerte mehr als drei Jahre, bis dieses Ziel mit der Gründung der Fédération Internationale de Luge (FIL) erreicht wurde. Das Amt des ersten FIL-Präsidenten übernahm der Österreicher Bert Isatitsch, der zuvor schon die Rodelsektion innerhalb der FIBT geleitet hatte. Isatitsch wurde in den folgenden 30Jahren nach der Meinung vieler Beobachter zum prägenden Mann des Rennrodelns, dessen Verdienste besonders in der olympischen Etablierung der Sportart lagen. 1955 fanden als weiterer Schritt zur Internationalisierung erste Weltmeisterschaften statt, bei denen jedoch ausschließlich Europäer starteten, obwohl kurz zuvor schon die Vereinigten Staaten sowie Kanada der Rodelsektion beigetreten waren. Nachdem die FIL im September 1957 auf der IOK-Sitzung in Sofia endgültig vom IOK als eigenständiger Dachverband anerkannt worden war, konnte Isatitsch auf der nächsten Sitzung des Komitees 1959 in München die Interessen der Sportart selbst vertreten. Dort vergaben die Delegierten in einer klaren Abstimmung die Olympischen Winterspiele 1964 nach Innsbruck; gleichzeitig legten sie Rodeln als olympische Disziplin für diese Spiele fest. Auf der Versammlung 1961 wurde das Programm vorgestellt: Das olympische Rodeln sollte in den drei Wettkämpfen durchgeführt werden, die sich schon bei Welt- und Europameisterschaften bewährt hatten – im Einsitzer der Männer und Frauen sowie im Doppelsitzer. Ungewiss war zuvor die Aufnahme des Fraueneinsitzers gewesen, über die sich Isatitsch besonders erfreut zeigte., Olympische Anfänge auf Natureis (1964 bis 1972)., Schon kurz nachdem Innsbruck die Zusage für die Olympischen Winterspiele 1964 erhalten hatte, begann im Innsbrucker Ortsteil Igls der Bau der Natur-Bob- und Rodelbahn. Mit Ausnahme eines Schneemangels im Winter 1963 gab es keine technischen Probleme bei der Konstruktion; das Schweizer IOK-Mitglied Albert Mayer bezeichnete die Bahn später als die „perfekteste aller Pisten, die [er] während [s]einer Sportlerlaufbahn kennengelernt habe“. Auch ansonsten zeigte sich Mayer von der „in jeder Hinsicht perfekt[en]“ Organisation beeindruckt, er habe über diese nur Komplimente gehört. Weitere Beobachter zogen ebenfalls ein überaus positives Fazit: In der deutschen Fachzeitschrift \\"Olympisches Feuer\\" sah Gerhard Strabenow durch den Verlauf der Rennen bewiesen, dass „Rennrodeln ein Wettkampf ist, der die ganze Kühnheit und Entschlossenheit, die beste Kondition und das große Können eines wahren Sportsmannes verlangt“. Der FIL-Präsident Bert Isatitsch sprach von den „aufregendsten Stunden seines Lebens“; er sei stolz, dass sein Einsatz der vielen Jahre mit diesem Erfolg gekrönt worden sei. Sportlich prägten besonders die Athleten der gesamtdeutschen Mannschaft den Olympiaeinstand des Rennrodelns: In den beiden Einzeldisziplinen gab es jeweils deutsche Doppelsiege – bei den Männern wurde Thomas Köhler erster Rodelolympiasieger, bei den Frauen Ortrun Enderlein (beide aus der DDR). Im Doppelsitzer triumphierte dagegen das österreichische Duo Josef Feistmantl/Manfred Stengl, nachdem die deutsche Paarung in Führung liegend, gestürzt war. Auch zuvor war es im Training zu Unfällen gekommen; bei einem von diesen starb der 54-jährige Brite Kazimierz Skrzypecki: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Rennrodeln, Olympische Winterspiele, Einsitzer, Frauen, Männer, Teamstaffel, Doppelsitzer, Reglement, Medaillengewinner, FIL-Wettbewerbe"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Anatomie der Vögel], Die Luftsäcke (\\"Sacci pneumatici\\") der Vögel sind dünnwandige Anhänge der Lunge, die wie Blasebälge die Luft durch die Lunge führen. In ihnen findet jedoch kein Gasaustausch statt. Es handelt sich um hauchdünne Säcke mit einer durchsichtigen Wand. Neben ihrer Funktion als „Motor der Atmung“ sind sie auch an der Stimmbildung beteiligt. Hochfrequente Exspirationen (Ausatmungen) werden im Stimmkopf (\\"Syrinx\\") zum Vogelgesang moduliert. Die dritte wichtige Funktion der Luftsäcke ist die Beteiligung an der Thermoregulation durch die Wärmeabgabe über Verdunstung., Anatomie., Gewebe., Die Luftsäcke sind größtenteils von einem einschichtigen Plattenepithel ausgekleidet. Teilweise treten auch kubische und hochprismatische Flimmerepithelzellen auf. In ihre Wand sind elastische Fasern und glatte Muskulatur eingelagert. Darin verlaufen auch einzelne Nervenfasern, bei denen bei einigen Vögeln der Ursprung aus dem Nervus vagus beschrieben ist, über deren Funktion bislang aber keine Kenntnisse vorliegen., Einteilung der Luftsäcke., Die Luftsäcke werden während der Entwicklung bereits sehr früh im Embryo angelegt. Sie entstehen beim Huhn am 5. und 6. Embryonaltag, gleichzeitig mit der Entwicklung der Lungen, aber vor der Bildung der Sekundärbronchien. Am 10. Tag sind die Luftsäcke bereits vollständig entwickelt und zeigen danach nur noch ein Größenwachstum., Embryonal werden sechs Luftsackpaare angelegt, von denen zwei Paare bei fast allen Vögeln (Ausnahme Haubentaucher) in der weiteren Entwicklung zum einheitlichen Schlüsselbeinluftsack verschmelzen. Beim Truthuhn werden nur fünf Luftsackpaare angelegt., Zahl der Luftsäcke., Die Vögel besitzen maximal 12 Luftsäcke, aufgrund der Verschmelzung der vier Schlüsselbeinluftsäcke aber im Regelfall nur 9. Die artspezifische Zahl schwankt zwischen 7 und 11., Luftsacksysteme., Man unterscheidet funktionell zwei Luftsacksysteme:, Atemmechanik bei Vögeln., Prinzip., Die Atmung der Vögel unterscheidet sich grundsätzlich von der der Säugetiere. Bei Säugetieren ändern die Muskeln für Inspiration (Einatmung) und Exspiration (Ausatmung) das Volumen des Brustkorbs und mit diesem das Volumen der Lungen, wodurch Luft in die Lungen ein- und ausströmt. Auch bei Reptilien ändern Muskeln das Volumen des Brustkorbs – und sofern vorhanden, das ihrer Luftsäcke – zur Atmung, während die Lunge von Vögeln keine Volumenänderungen ausführen kann., Die wichtigsten Inspirationsmuskeln sind die Rippenanhangsmuskeln (\\"Musculi appendicocostales\\"). Ihre Kontraktion führt zur Erweiterung des Brustkorbs. Auch die Abwärtsbewegung des Brustbeins trägt maßgeblich zu diesem Prozess bei. Dies führt zu einem Unterdruck in der Leibeshöhle und damit zu einer Erweiterung der Luftsäcke, wodurch Luft durch die Lunge hindurch angesaugt wird. Die wichtigsten Exspirationsmuskeln sind die Bauchmuskeln, die die Leibeshöhle verengen und damit die Luft aus den Luftsäcken verdrängen. Sowohl bei der Ein- als auch bei der Ausatmung strömt die Luft von hinten nach vorn durch die Parabronchien der Lunge., Ruheatmung., In der Ruheatmung (Abb. A) ist zumeist nur das hintere Luftsacksystem aktiv. Von den beiden hinteren Luftsackpaaren wird Luft durch einen Teil der Lunge (so genannte \\"Neopulmo\\") gesaugt, zum Teil gelangt auch Frischluft in diese Luftsäcke. Damit befindet sich am Ende der Einatmung Mischluft mit einem noch nutzbaren Sauerstoffanteil in den hinteren Luftsäcken. Bei der Ausatmung wird diese Mischluft nun noch einmal durch die Lunge geleitet und somit viel effektiver ausgenutzt als beim Säugetier mit seinen blind endenden Luftwegen und dem dementsprechend hohen Totraum., Dieses effiziente System kompensiert auch das große Volumen der Luftröhre bei Vögeln, die im Vergleich zu Säugetieren länger und dicker ist und ein etwa 4,5faches Totraumvolumen hat., Forcierte Atmung., Bei vermehrter Atmung (Abb. B) kommt zu der normalen Atmung noch das vordere Luftsacksystem dazu. Es saugt Frischluft durch den übrigen Teil der Lunge (so genannte \\"Palaeopulmo\\"). Die verbrauchte Luft dieses Luftsacksystems gelangt bei der Ausatmung direkt in die Luftröhre, wird also nicht noch einmal durch die Lunge geleitet., Tierartliche Besonderheiten., Bei Vogelarten ohne Neopulmo (z.B. Pinguine) gelangt nur Frischluft in die hinteren Luftsäcke, sie nutzen bei der Einatmung das vordere, bei der Ausatmung das hintere System. Bei Störchen ist die Neopulmo schwach entwickelt., Konsequenzen aus der Atemmechanik., Beim Festhalten und bei der Manipulation von Vögeln ist die komplexe Atemmechanik zu beachten. Beim In-die-Hand-nehmen ist darauf zu achten, dass der Brustkorb nicht zu stark in seiner Bewegung eingeschränkt wird. Legt man Vögel auf den Rücken, so behindert die Last der übrigen Organe die Entfaltung der Bauchluftsäcke und die Schwerkraft des Brustmuskels die des Brustbeins, so dass es schnell zu Atemnot oder gar zu einer Erstickung kommen kann., Evolutionärer Ursprung des Luftsacksystems., Bei zahlreichen Vertretern der Theropoden, der Klade der Dinosaurier, aus denen die modernen Vögel hervorgingen, sind Wirbel und Rippen mit pneumatischen Foramina vergleichbar denen rezenter Vögel nachgewiesen, ebenso beim Urvogel \\"Archaeopteryx\\". Sie weisen darauf hin, dass bereits bei den Vorfahren der Vögel bestimmte Knochen mit Aussackungen (Divertikeln) eines Luftsacksystems gefüllt (das heißt pneumatisiert) waren. Innerhalb der Archosaurier, deren rezente Vertreter die Krokodile und die Vögel sind, besaßen neben den Theropoden, die als Stammgruppe der Vögel gelten, weitere Gruppen (die Flugsaurier und die Sauropoden) pneumatisierte Knochen, so dass von manchen Paläontologen angenommen wird, ein Luftsacksystem sei nicht nur ein urtümliches Merkmal der Vögel, sondern das einer weitaus größeren und älteren Gruppe, der so genannten Ornithodiren, gewesen., Inwiefern die Funktion des Atmungssystems bei rezenten Vögeln und Nicht-Vogel-Theropoden ähnlich war, wird kontrovers diskutiert: O’Connor und Claessens (2005) schlagen für Nicht-Vogel-Theropoden eine den Vögeln ähnliche Form der Durchströmungsatmung vor. Sie wiesen in einem gut erhaltenen fossilen Exemplar der urtümlichen Theropoden-Gattung \\"Majungatholus\\" pneumatische Öffnungen in Hals-, Brust- und Beckenwirbeln nach., Dass die Neuralbögen der Brustwirbel 12 und 13 verglichen mit den davor und dahinter liegenden besonders kleine Öffnungen zeigen, interpretieren sie als Trennung zwischen einem vorderen (kranialen) und einem hinteren (kaudalen) Luftsacksystem, denen jeweils die Divertikel in den vorderen bzw. hinteren Wirbelkörpern und Neuralbögen zuzuordnen sind. Das Vorhandensein eines hinteren Luftsacksystems, das mechanisch einfacher zu „belüften“ sei als ein vorderes, halten O’Connor und Claessens für eine entscheidende Voraussetzung für eine vogelähnliche Durchströmung der Lunge (siehe Ruheatmung bei rezenten Vögeln, Abb. A)., Theropoden einschließlich früher Vögel besaßen im Gegensatz zu rezenten flugfähigen Vögeln nur ein kleines, kaum den vorderen Brustbereich einnehmendes Brustbein und ein dreistrahliges Becken – das Schambein war bauchwärts gerichtet und nicht wie bei späteren Vögeln parallel zu Darmbein und Sitzbein rotiert. Offenbar spielten Auf- und Abwärtsbewegungen des Brustbeins sowie Rotationen des Beckens („Beckenatmung“) beim Ein- und Ausatmen zu Beginn der Vogelevolution noch keine Rolle. Andererseits waren Theropoden einschließlich urtümlicher mesozoische Vögel wie \\"Archaeopteryx\\", \\"Confuciusornis\\" und \\"Sinornis\\" im Besitz miteinander verzahnter Bauchrippen (\\"Gastralia\\"). Durch die Kontraktion der Bauchmuskulatur (besonders des \\"Musculus rectus abdominis\\") wurden laut Claessens (2004) die Bauchrippen gegeneinander geschoben und so der hintere Brustraum seitlich erweitert. Somit ermöglichte die Kontraktion derselben Muskeln, die bei rezenten Vögeln zur Verringerung des Brustraumvolumens beim Ausatmen beitragen, bei frühen Vögeln und Nicht-Vogel-Theropoden paradoxerweise das Einatmen. Dieser Atemmechanismus, der auf Verschiebung eines Systems von Bauchrippen beruht, wird nach Carrier und Farmer (2000) auch als „Kürassatmung“ (\\"cuirassal breathing\\") bezeichnet und als eine notwendige Voraussetzung für eine urtümliche Durchströmungsatmung angesehen. Bei späteren Vögeln wurde mit dem Verlust der Bauchrippen diese Form der Brustraumkontraktion und -expansion durch andere Formen abgelöst., In welchem phylogenetischen Stadium zuerst ein Atemmechanismus ähnlich dem der heutigen Vögel vorlag, ist noch weitgehend offen. Bevor es der Atmung diente, könnte das Luftsacksystem bei Dinosauriern und Flugsauriern thermoregulatorische Funktion gehabt und zur Gewichtsreduktion beigetragen haben. Ruben u.a. (1997, 1999) glauben, bei Fossilien der kleinen theropoden Dinosaurier \\"Sinosauropteryx\\" und \\"Scipionyx\\" versteinertes Weichgewebe des Brust- und Bauchraums vorliegen zu haben, das zeige, dass die Atmung der Theropoden der der Vögel nicht ähnlich sei: Angeblich sei der Brustraum wie bei Krokodilen durch ein Zwerchfell unterteilt gewesen, dessen kolbenartige Bewegung das Ein- und Ausatmen steuerte. Diese Theorie lässt jedoch den Nachweis pneumatischer Foramina in einer großen Zahl von Theropoden unbeachtet. Und dass die Versteinerungen bzw. Hautschatten im Bereich des Bauchraums der genannten Exemplare tatsächlich oben genannte Aussagen zur Lage und Anatomie der inneren Organe zulassen, gilt unter Paläontologen als zweifelhaft., Klinische Bedeutung., Das Luftsacksystem ist häufig bei Erkrankungen der Atemwege mit betroffen. Der Bau der Luftsäcke führt dazu, dass Vögel, anders als Säugetiere, Fremdkörper nicht abhusten können. Erkrankungen des Luftsacks gehen im Allgemeinen mit schwerer Atemnot einher., Die Luftsäcke sind limitierender Faktor für die Ultraschalluntersuchung bei Vögeln, da die Grenzfläche Gewebe/Luft eine Totalreflexion der Schallwellen verursacht. Eine direkte Applikation von Isofluran in die Luftsäcke ist als Narkosemöglichkeit beschrieben.]: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Anatomie der Vögel, Luftsäcke, Atmung, Säcke, Stimmbildung, Funktion, Plattenepithel, embryonale Entwicklung, Luftsackpaare, Atemmechanik"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Zellbestandteil, Zellorganell], Ein Organell (Diminutiv zu Organ, also „Orgänchen“) ist ein strukturell abgrenzbarer Bereich einer Zelle mit einer besonderen Funktion. Die Definition ist uneinheitlich: Manche Autoren bezeichnen nur Strukturen mit Membran als Organellen, also beispielsweise Zellkern, Mitochondrien, Plastiden (mit Chloroplasten), den Golgi-Apparat und das Endoplasmatische Retikulum. Andere fassen den Begriff weiter und schließen auch andere Strukturen ein, beispielsweise Centriolen. Bei Einzellern wird „Organell“ in diesem Sinn als Bezeichnung für komplexe Strukturen wie Geißel und Augenfleck verwendet., Einzellige Lebewesen ohne Zellkern (Prokaryoten) haben in der Regel keine Membranen im Inneren der Zelle und demnach auch keine Organellen nach der ersten Definition. Es gibt jedoch prokaryotische Strukturen, die als Organellen im weiteren Sinn aufgefasst werden können, beispielsweise Geißeln., Zum Auffinden weiterer zellulärer Strukturen (wie Organellen) kommen heute auch KI-gestützte Methoden zum Einsatz. Man schätzt, dass derzeit nicht einmal die Hälfte aller solcher Strukturen bekannt ist (Stand November 2021)., Begriffsgeschichte und Definitionen., Als \\"Organ\\" wird in der Biologie eine abgegrenzte Funktionseinheit innerhalb eines Lebewesens bezeichnet. Die Analogie zu den mikroskopischen Strukturen innerhalb einer Zelle ist für Autoren entsprechender Lehrbücher anscheinend so offensichtlich, dass sie nicht näher erläutert wird. Der erste, der für entsprechende zelluläre Strukturen eine Verkleinerungsform des Wortes ‚Organ‘ benutzte, war vermutlich der deutsche Zoologe Karl August Möbius (1884):, Organulum (Plural: Organula) ist die Verkleinerungsform zum lateinischen Organum. In einer Fußnote, die als Berichtigung in der folgenden Ausgabe der Zeitschrift erschien, erklärte Möbius:, Die ursprünglichste Definition des Begriffs beschränkte sich demnach ausschließlich auf Zellbestandteile von Einzellern., Einige etwas später erschienene Arbeiten nennen Möbius namentlich als Urheber., Es dauerte noch etliche Jahre, bis die Bezeichnung \\"Organulum\\" oder die neuere Entsprechung \\"Organell\\" sich generell durchsetzten und in einer erweiterten Bedeutung damit auch Bestandteile von Zellen mehrzelliger Organismen bezeichnet wurden. Bücher und Lehrbücher um 1900, von Valentin Häcker, Edmund Wilson und Oscar Hertwig, sprachen noch von den \\"Organen\\" der Zelle. Später wurden beide Bezeichnungen wohl eine Zeit lang nebeneinander verwendet: Bengt Lidforss schrieb 1915: „Eine Neubildung dieser Organe oder Organellen findet wenigstens bei höheren Pflanzen nicht statt“., Gegen 1920 wurde der Ausdruck \\"Organell\\" benutzt für die Antriebsstrukturen („motor organelle complex“, Flagellen und deren Verankerung) und andere Strukturen von Einzellern. Alfred Kühn schrieb 1920 von den Centriolen als \\"Teilungsorganellen\\", für welche allerdings bei den Vahlkampfien gelte, dass „die Alternative: Organell oder Produkt der Strukturbildung“ noch nicht entschieden sei – ohne aber darauf einzugehen, worin der Unterschied zwischen beiden Alternativen läge., Max Hartmann benutzte den Ausdruck 1953 in einem Lehrbuch für extrazelluläre (Pellicula, Schalen, Zellwände) und intrazelluläre Skelette der Einzeller., Erst später bildete sich die \\"heute weit verbreitete Definition\\" heraus, nach der nur von einer Membran umgebene Zellbestandteile als Organellen angesehen werden. Manchmal wird dies noch weiter eingeschränkt und nur Mitochondrien und Plastiden, die ein eigenes Genom haben, werden als Organellen bezeichnet. Aber auch die ursprünglichere Definition der subzellulären Funktionseinheiten im Allgemeinen ist weiterhin in Benutzung., Der Ursprung der Bezeichnung \\"Organell\\" im deutschen Sprachraum scheint vergessen worden zu sein. Albert Frey-Wyssling schrieb 1978 vom „englischen Terminus ‚the organelle‘“, der häufig falsch mit ‚die Organelle‘ statt mit ‚das Organell‘ übersetzt würde. Frey-Wyssling schlug vor, dass sämtliche Energie verbrauchenden Strukturelemente der Zelle und nur diese als Organellen bezeichnet werden sollten, also beispielsweise auch Centrosomen, Ribosomen und Nucleoli. Diese Energie-abhängige Definition hat sich jedoch nicht durchgesetzt., Im Gegensatz zur Bezeichnung \\"Organell\\", welche sich immer auf ein einzelnes Objekt bezieht (etwa \\"ein\\" Mitochondrium), wird die Bezeichnung \\"Kompartiment\\" für die Summe aller gleichartigen zellulären Räume verwendet. Eine Zelle kann demnach viele Mitochondrien haben, aber nur ein mitochondriales Kompartiment. Auch das Cytoplasma ist ein Kompartiment, aber kein Organell., Membranbegrenzte Organellen., Mitochondrien, der Zellkern und Plastiden (Chloroplasten und deren Verwandte) sind von einer doppelten Membran umgeben. Andere membranbegrenzte Organellen haben eine einfache Membran. Hierzu zählen die Komponenten des Endomembransystems und bei Pflanzen die Zellsaftvakuole. Daneben gibt es einige spezielle membranbegrenzte Organellen, die nur in bestimmten Zelltypen oder bestimmten eukaryotischen Artengruppen, meist Einzellern, auftreten., Semiautonome Organellen., Die bei fast allen Eukaryoten vorkommenden Mitochondrien und die für Algen und höhere Pflanzen spezifischen Plastiden haben ein eigenes Genom (Mitogenom bzw. Plastom) und eine eigene Maschinerie zur Proteinbiosynthese (Mitoribosomen bzw. Plastoribosomen). Sie werden daher als ‚semiautonome Organellen‘ bezeichnet., Nach der Endosymbiontentheorie handelt es sich bei ihnen stammesgeschichtlich gesehen um Abkömmlinge von Bakterien, die von frühen eukaryotischen Zellen aufgenommen wurden. Diese Bakterien wurden im Lauf der Evolution in die Zelle integriert. Durch die Anwesenheit der Mitochondrien-Vorläufer (von α-Proteobakterien abstammend) war es der frühen eukaryotischen, zuvor anaeroben, Zelle erstmals möglich, die sehr viel effektivere sauerstoffabhängige Energiegewinnung zu nutzen. Durch die Aufnahme von Cyanobakterien, die sich zu den Plastiden entwickelten, war die Nutzung des Sonnenlichts zur Energiegewinnung möglich: Es entstanden eukaryotische Algen und damit die Vorläufer aller Pflanzen., Semiautonome Organellen haben eine Doppelmembran: Die äußere wird von der Wirtszelle gebildet, ist also eukaryotischen Ursprungs. Sie leitet sich ab von der bei der Aufnahme der Organell-Vorgänger abgeschnürten Plasmamembran. Die innere Membran ist prokaryotischen Ursprungs. Hierbei handelt es sich um die modifizierte Plasmamembran des Symbionten. Sie stellt eine Diffusionsxadbarriere für den Austausch von Molekülen und Elektronen dar., Überflüssige Strukturen der Bakterienzellen gingen verloren, die meisten Gene wurden in den Zellkern der Wirtszelle transferiert oder gingen ebenfalls verloren. Einige Gene wurden aber auch zum Genom der Organellen zugefügt, z.B. Gene für den Austausch von Proteinen und Aminosäuren mit der Wirtszelle. Übrig blieben die heute noch vorhandenen Reste des aus einem ringförmigen DNA-Molekül bestehenden prokaryotischen Genoms und Strukturen, die für die Funktion der Organellen wichtig sind., Semiautonome Organellen vermehren sich eigenständig durch Teilung. Bei der Teilung der Wirtszelle werden sie auf die Tochterzellen aufgeteilt., Ebenfalls semiautonome komplexe Plastiden entstehen durch Aufnahme einer Algenzelle, deren Plastiden eine verschachtelte Struktur wie eine Matrjoschka-Puppe mit insgesamt 3 oder 4 Membranen zeigen, außen mit einer oder zwei eukaryotischen Membranen., Andere häufige membranbegrenzte Organellen., Neben den semiautonomen Organellen hat nur der Zellkern eine doppelte Membran, die Kernhülle. Die in diesem Abschnitt beschriebenen Organellen kommen in der Regel in allen Zellen eines Organismus vor. Hierzu gehören bei Pflanzen die Zellsaftvakuole und bei allen Eukaryoten verschiedene Komponenten des Endomembransystems: das Endoplasmatische Retikulum (ER), der Golgi-Apparat, Lysosomen und Peroxisomen. Eine Kurzbeschreibung dieser Organellen findet sich im Artikel Zelle an dieser Stelle.Transport-Vesikel, die für Stoffaustausch zwischen den anderen Komponenten sorgen, gehören ebenfalls zum Endomembransystem. Deren Einschluss in die Definition eines Organells ist uneinheitlich: Manchmal werden einzelne Vesikel als Organellen bezeichnet, manchmal nicht., Pflanzliche Zellen., In Pflanzenzellen fehlen Endosomen. Dafür haben sie Plastiden und eine Zellsaftvakuole. Eine Pflanzenzelle hat mindestens einen der Plastidtypen Chloroplast, Chromoplast und Leukoplast. Während der Differenzierung kann sich ein Plastidtyp in einen anderen umwandeln. Plastiden enthalten mit eigener DNA auch eigene Ribosomen (Plastoribosomen)., Spezielle membranbegrenzte Organellen., Zelltyp-spezifische Organellen von Mehrzellern., Die hier gelisteten Organellen kommen nur in einigen Zelltypen von bestimmten mehrzelligen Lebewesen vor, in anderen Zelltypen derselben Lebewesen aber nicht., Taxonspezifische Organellen., Hier sind Organellen aufgeführt, die in eukaryotischen Einzellern oder bei bestimmten mehrzelligen Arten in allen Zellen auftreten. Komplexe Plastiden wie die Apicoplasten können eigene Organellen besitzen (Nucleomorph, ein reduzierter Zellkern) und verschiedene Arten von Ribosomen. Die Plastiden der Rotalgen werden auch als Rhodoplasten, die der Glaucophyten und der photosynthetisch aktiven Arten von \\"Paulinella\\" (wegen ihrer Ursprünglichkeit) als Cyanellen (cyanobakterienartige Organellen) bezeichnet. Weitere komplexe Organellen sind die Augenflecken zumeist photosynthetisierender, begeißelter Protisten und vor allem die Ocelloide einzelliger Dinoflagellaten der Familie Warnowiaceae (Warnowiiden), die der Phototaxis dienen., Erworbene temporäre Organellen., Werden semiautonome Organellen aus der Beute aufgenommen, so sind diese (per Definition) nicht auf Dauer funktionsfähig. Insbesondere sind sie in der Zelle bzw. den Zellen des Räubers nicht vermehrungsfähig und müssen daher – spätestens bei dessen Vermehrung – durch die Aufnahme (Phagocytose) weiterer Beute ersetzt werden. Handelt es sich bei den Organellen um Plastiden, spricht man von Kleptoplastidie. Bei Dinoflagellaten bleiben offenbar auch die Zellkerne der Beute eine Zeit lang funktionell (Karyokleptie). Beim Wimpertierchen \\"Mesodinium rubrum\\" wurde auch die Aufnahme von Beute-Mitochondrien beobachtet., Eukaryotische Organellen ohne Membran., Eine neuere Definition setzt voraus, dass eine umgebende Membran vorhanden ist. Die ältere Bedeutung des Begriffs, die ebenfalls noch verwendet wird, kennt jedoch keine solche Voraussetzung. Nach dieser Bedeutung werden alle zellulären Strukturen, die als Organ-ähnlich angesehen werden, als Organell bezeichnet. Die Abgrenzung von derart definierten Organellen zu größeren Molekülkomplexen ist schwierig.

Andere Stämme des Erregers verursachen eine Erkrankung bei Altweltmäusen und Hundeartigen. Die Encephalitozoonose kommt vor allem bei immungeschwächten Tieren vor. Sie ist eine potenzielle Zoonose und kann, wenn auch sehr selten, ebenfalls bei immunschwachen Menschen auftreten. Die Erkrankung wurde erstmals 1922 von \\"Wright und Craighead\\" beschrieben., Der Erreger befällt vor allem die Niere und das Gehirn. Letzteres zeigt sich in neurologischen Störungen, wobei eine Kopfschiefhaltung das häufigste Symptom ist. Mit dem Antiparasitikum Fenbendazol lassen sich der Erreger und damit Neuinfektionen bekämpfen. Beim Auftreten klinischer Erscheinungen muss die Therapie durch Gabe von Antibiotika und unterstützende Maßnahmen erweitert werden, die Heilungsaussicht ist dann unsicher., Erreger und Vorkommen., \\"Encephalitozoon cuniculi\\" ist ein nur in Zellen höherer Organismen (\\"obligat intrazellulär\\") lebender Einzeller aus der Gruppe der Mikrosporidien. Wie alle Mikrosporidien handelt es sich um einen eng mit den Pilzen verwandten Organismus mit Zellkern und Zellmembran (Eukaryot), dem aber einige Zellorganellen wie beispielsweise Mitochondrien fehlen. Das Genom ist mit 2,9 Millionen Basenpaaren, die nur knapp 2000 Proteine kodieren, außerordentlich klein. In Säugetieren befällt der Parasit die Zellen der Niere, des Gehirns und anderer Organe. Außerhalb seines Wirts überlebt der Einzeller in Form einer 2µm großen Spore, die das infektiöse Dauerstadium darstellt., Je nach Hauptwirt werden drei verschiedene Stämme von \\"Encephalitozoon cuniculi\\" unterschieden. Kaninchen sind prinzipiell für alle drei empfänglich, natürliche Infektionen wurden aber bislang nur für den Kaninchenstamm beschrieben. Folgende Stämme kommen vor:, \\"E. cuniculi\\" kommt weltweit vor, die Erkrankung wurde erstmals 1922 bei Kaninchen beschrieben. Antikörper gegen den \\"E. cuniculi\\" lassen sich bei vielen Säugetieren nachweisen. Berichte über menschliche Erkrankungen beschränken sich auf immunsupprimierte und AIDS-Patienten, wobei vermutlich nur der Kaninchen- und der Hundestamm potenziell gefährlich sind. In der Ostslowakei betrug die Seroprävalenz 5,7 %, bei Menschen mit Immundefekten sogar 37,5 %. Bei Pferden liegt die Seroprävalenz zwischen 14 % und 60 %., Infektionsweg und Krankheitsentstehung., Die häufigste Art der Übertragung scheint die orale Aufnahme der vor allem über den Urin ausgeschiedenen Sporen zu sein. Eine Übertragung des Erregers von der Mutter auf die Föten vor der Geburt (\\"intrauterin\\") ist ebenfalls möglich. Nach der Aufnahme der Sporen wird der Erreger im Darm von Fresszellen (Phagozyten) aufgenommen und mit ihnen über die Blutbahn verteilt., Die Infektion löst normalerweise keine Erkrankung aus. Der Wirt reagiert auf ein Eindringen des Erregers mit einer Immunreaktion, die durch zytotoxische CD8(+) T-Zellen vermittelt wird., Zu einem Krankheitsausbruch kommt es unter Umständen erst Jahre nach der Infektion bei einer Störung des Immunsystems, beispielsweise wenn die Tiere Lärm und Stress ausgesetzt sind. Der Erreger besiedelt bei Kaninchen dann vor allem die Nieren, wo er eine chronische Nierenentzündung mit Proliferation oder Atrophie des Epithels der Nierenkanälchen verursacht. Im Gehirn und den Hirnhäuten kommt es erst bei chronischer Infektion zu einer eitrigen Entzündung (Meningoenzephalitis) mit Vermehrung (Gliose) der Astrozyten und Lymphozyteninfiltrationen um die Blutgefäße. Darüber hinaus können sich Sporen in der Augenlinse ansiedeln und eine phakoklastische Uveitis auslösen, diese Lokalisation scheint aber ausschließlich bei einer Übertragung im Mutterleib stattzufinden. Bei Tamarinen wurden darüber hinaus auch Herzmuskel-, Leber-, Lungen-, Skelettmuskel- und Netzhautentzündungen nachgewiesen. Bei immunsupprimierten Mäusen zeigte sich eine nichteitrige, lymphozytäre Meningoenzephalitis mit Untergang von Nervenzellen und Astrogliose. Pferde können eine nekrotisierende Entzündung des Mutterkuchens (Plazentitis) entwickeln., Symptome., Die klassischen Symptome einer Encephalitozoonose bei Kaninchen sind neurologische Störungen wie Schiefhals (Torticollis), meist in Kombination mit Augenzittern (Nystagmus), Störungen der Bewegungskoordination (Ataxie), steifer Gang, Lähmungen und Krämpfe. Tiere mit starker Gehirnaffektion drehen sich im fortgeschrittenen Krankheitsverlauf nicht selten unkontrolliert um ihre eigene Längsachse und können sich dabei schwer verletzen. Die Krankheit kann sich aber auch in Form einer Niereninsuffizienz oder einer Linsentrübung und Entzündung der mittleren Augenhaut nach Ruptur der Linsenkapsel (\\"phakoklastische Uveitis\\") manifestieren. In einer Studie zeigten 45 % der erkrankten Kaninchen neurologische Ausfallserscheinungen, 31 % eine Nierensymptomatik und 14 % eine Uveitis. Vor allem bei Außenhaltung besteht bei neurologischen Störungen aufgrund der eingeschränkten Bewegungsmöglichkeit und damit der Körperpflege die Gefahr eines Fliegenmadenbefalls., Bei Hunden und Füchsen äußert sich eine Encephalitozoonose in Nierenversagen und zentralnervösen Erscheinungen, die der Staupe ähneln. Derartige Erkrankungen wurden bei Hunden bislang nur in Afrika und den Vereinigten Staaten beobachtet, während Erkrankungen bei Füchsen auch in Skandinavien auftraten. Bei Katzen kommt es vor allem zu Augeninfektionen (phakoklastische Uveitis, fokale Linsentrübung, Uveitis anterior), wobei als Auslöser vor allem der Mäusestamm (Typ II) in Frage kommt., Bei anderen Tieren sind die Krankheitssymptome zumeist unspezifisch und eine Encephalitozoonose wird erst bei der pathologischen Sektion entdeckt. Bei Halbaffen treten Totgeburten und plötzliche Todesfälle bei Jungtieren auf. Bei Pferden ist die Bedeutung des serologischen Nachweises noch nicht geklärt: \\"Encephalitozoon cuniculi\\" kann Aborte auslösen, wird aber auch im Zusammenhang mit Koliken und neurologischen Störungen diskutiert. Die Symptome bei immunsupprimierten oder HIV-infizierten Menschen werden im Abschnitt „Gefahr für den Menschen“ dargestellt., Diagnosestellung., Die Diagnose ist am lebenden Tier nicht sicher zu stellen., Bei der klinischen Diagnosestellung handelt es sich immer um eine Verdachtsdiagnose. Da viele Hauskaninchen den Erreger in sich tragen, ohne daran zu erkranken, gibt eine serologische Untersuchung auf Antikörper (India-Ink Immunoreaktion, Titerbestimmung durch indirekte Immunfluoreszenz) gegen den Erreger zwar einen Hinweis auf eine erfolgte Ansteckung, ob die bestehenden Symptome aber dadurch bedingt werden, muss per Ausschluss anderer Erkrankungen abgeklärt werden. Ein Antikörpertiter kann auch bei über 40 % der gesunden Kaninchen nachgewiesen werden. Eine Studie fand bei Kaninchen mit klinischem Verdacht mittlere Titer von 1:1324 und damit etwa 1,7fach höhere Werte als bei Tieren ohne einen solchen. Weitere Studien konnten dagegen keinen Zusammenhang zwischen Titerhöhe und Erkrankung nachweisen. Zudem können die Antikörperspiegel nach einer Infektion über Jahre hoch bleiben. Kaninchen, die sich bereits im Mutterleib infiziert haben, weisen meist keine Antikörper auf, da der Erreger nicht als fremd erkannt wird (→ Selbsttoleranz). Der direkte Nachweis der Erreger-DNA mittels PCR im Urin, Kot oder Hirnwasser ist selten erfolgreich. Darüber hinaus tritt Erreger-DNA im Urin erst drei bis fünf Wochen nach der Infektion auf und auch bei einigen gesunden Tieren. Lediglich bei einer phakoklastischen Uveitis kann durch PCR an entferntem Linsenmaterial die Diagnose meist eindeutig gestellt werden., Das Leitsymptom „Schiefhals“ kann bei Kaninchen auch bei einer Entzündung des Innenohrs (Otitis interna, Haupterreger \\"Pasteurella multocida\\"), Virusinfektionen des Gehirns, Listeriose, Toxoplasmose, wandernden Larven (\\"Larva migrans\\") des Waschbärspulwurms, Tumoren (vor allem Lymphome) und Abszessen des Gehirns sowie Kopfverletzungen auftreten. Auch Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen, Vergiftungen, Stoffwechselstörungen oder ein Rückenmarkstrauma können neurologische Ausfallserscheinungen verursachen. Ein Teil dieser Erkrankungen kann durch bildgebende Verfahren nachgewiesen werden und somit eine Encephalitozoonose indirekt ausschließen., Eine sichere Diagnose ist nur nach dem Tod durch eine pathologische Untersuchung mit Nachweis des Erregers möglich. Er lässt sich durch Immunhistochemie oder PCR nachweisen. Eine kulturelle Anzüchtung ist möglich, aber sehr aufwändig., Gefahr für den Menschen., Die Encephalitozoonose ist eine potenzielle Zoonose, allerdings wurden bislang nur Erkrankungen bei Menschen mit einer starken Schwächung des Immunsystems (z.B. AIDS-Patienten, Menschen mit Immunsuppression nach Organtransplantationen, Idiopathische CD4+ T-Lymphocytopenie) beobachtet. Theoretisch könnten auch Menschen mit einem schwach ausgeprägten Immunsystem (Kleinstkinder, sehr alte Menschen) empfänglich sein, allerdings gibt es dafür noch keine Hinweise., Erkrankte Tiere haben in den meisten Fällen bereits über einen langen Zeitraum die Erreger ausgeschieden. Obwohl ein großer Teil der Heimtierkaninchen seropositiv ist, liegen bisher keine Nachweise vor, dass sich ein Mensch bei einem Kaninchen oder einem anderen Tier angesteckt hat, obwohl der Infektionsweg beim Menschen bislang nicht geklärt ist. Es gibt einen Fall einer Mensch-zu-Mensch-Übertragung des Hundestamms bei einer Knochenmarktransplantation bei einem Morbus-Hodgkin-Patienten, der daraufhin an einer Lungenentzündung verstarb., Bei Menschen mit Immunschwäche spielen allerdings Durchfallerkrankungen infolge Infektionen mit \\"Encephalitozoon bieneusi\\" und \\"Encephalitozoon intestinalis\\" die weitaus größere Rolle, während \\"Encephalitozoon cuniculi\\"-Infektionen selbst bei diesem Personenkreis sehr selten sind. Die Symptome einer solchen Erkrankung reichen von Fieber, Brust-, Bauch-, Muskel- und Kopfschmerzen, Husten, Schnupfen, Durchfall, Nasennebenhöhlen- und Lungenentzündung, Binde- und Hornhautentzündung bis zum Nierenversagen.

Jahrhundert bis 1797 eine See- und Wirtschaftsmacht, deren Zentrum im Nordwesten der Adria lag. Ihre Vorherrschaft kulminierte in einem Kolonialreich, das von Oberitalien bis Kreta und zeitweise bis zur Krim und nach Zypern reichte und von Venedig aus gelenkt wurde. Darüber hinaus unterhielt Venedig Kaufmannskolonien in Flandern und dem Maghreb, in Alexandria und Akkon, in Konstantinopel und Trapezunt sowie in zahlreichen Städten an der Adria., Eine Handels- und Seemacht., Der Reichtum der Adelsrepublik resultierte daraus, dass sie als Umschlagplatz zwischen dem Byzantinischen Reich und dem Heiligen Römischen Reich fungierte und zugleich wichtige Waren monopolisierte. Dabei nutzte sie als Haupthandelswege die Flüsse Oberitaliens und vor allem die Adria. Auch die machtpolitische Zersplitterung Italiens war für sie vorteilhaft. Dabei übte ausschließlich der Adel den gewinnträchtigen Fernhandel (Levante) aus und kontrollierte zunehmend die politische Führung – bis hin zur Abschaffung der Volksversammlung., Über die Anfangszeit berichten hauptsächlich Legenden und nur wenige historisch zuverlässige Quellen. Erst ab dem 13. Jahrhundert gibt es eine breite schriftliche Überlieferung, die dann aber vom Ausmaß mit der von Rom verglichen werden kann. Zur Legendenbildung hat die staatlich kontrollierte Geschichtsschreibung erheblich beigetragen. Sie projizierte die als wegweisend wahrgenommenen Eigenheiten der venezianischen Gesellschaft oftmals in die Vergangenheit zurück. Dabei verschwieg sie vieles dessen, was den Idealen von Geschlossenheit, Gerechtigkeit und Machtbalance widersprach, oder deutete es um., Der Seemacht gelang es, trotz geringer Ressourcen und eines verstreuten Herrschaftsgebiets, eine erstrangige Rolle in der Politik des Mittelmeerraumes zu spielen. Dabei lavierte Venedig fast von Anfang an zwischen den Großmächten wie Byzanz und dem Heiligen Römischen Reich oder der päpstlichen Macht, nutzte rigoros die Schlagkraft seiner Kriegsflotte und seiner überlegenen Diplomatie, setzte Handelsblockaden und Berufsarmeen ein. Dabei hatte es sich der Konkurrenz italienischer Handelsstädte, wie etwa Amalfi, Pisa, Bologna, vor allem aber Genuas zu erwehren. Erst die großen Flächenstaaten wie das Osmanische Reich und Spanien drängten den Einfluss Venedigs militärisch, die aufstrebenden Handelsnationen wie die Vereinigten Niederlande, Portugal und Großbritannien wirtschaftlich zurück. Frankreich besetzte 1797 die Stadt; kurz zuvor hatte der Große Rat am 12. Mai für die Auflösung der Republik gestimmt., Entstehung und Aufstieg., Besiedlung der Lagune., Ausgangspunkt der Besiedlung Venedigs war eine Gruppe von Inseln im Umkreis und in der Lagune, die die Ablagerungen des Brenta und anderer kleiner Flüsse immer weiter in die Adria vorschoben. So ist der Canal Grande die Verlängerung des Nordarms des Brenta. Die Bevölkerungszahl der an und in der so entstandenen Lagune liegenden Fischersiedlungen, die bis in etruskische Zeit zurückreichen, stieg durch Flüchtlinge an, die sich der Legende nach 408 vor den Westgoten Alarichs, besonders aber 452 vor den Truppen des Hunnen Attila dort in Sicherheit brachten. Als 568 die Langobarden in Oberitalien einfielen, erreichte ein weiterer Flüchtlingsstrom die Lagune. Das legendäre Gründungsdatum Venedigs, der 25. März 421, könnte eine Erinnerung an die frühen Zuwanderer darstellen., Venedig ist aber keineswegs eine Gründung von Flüchtlingen, denn schon im 5. Jahrhundert war die nördliche Lagune dicht besiedelt, zahlreiche Artefakte weisen auf römische Siedlungen und Straßen hin. Die Legende der Flüchtlingsgründung entstand wohl erst im 10. Jahrhundert, sie wurde zuletzt von Roberto Cessi aufrechterhalten. Dieser sah einen starken Kontrast zwischen der germanischen und der venezianischen Welt, eine Ansicht, die inzwischen der Vorstellung gewichen ist, dass es diesen Kontrast zwischen einer barbarischen und einer römischen Zivilisation so nicht gegeben habe. Stattdessen geht man von zwei stark gemischten Gesellschaften aus. Die römische Epoche war sehr stark von ökologischen Veränderungen der Lagune geprägt, vor allem vom Anstieg des Wasserspiegels. Der frühmittelalterliche Handel basierte dabei viel stärker auf den Wasserwegen, während die römischen Straßen verfielen oder im Wasser versanken. Funde von Amphoren erweisen zugleich einen weitläufigen mediterranen Handel, der Konstantinopel zwar einschloss, aber nicht auf die Metropole ausgerichtet war. Diese Einbindung in einen weiteren politischen und wirtschaftlichen Rahmen dürfte durch die Flüchtlinge, zu denen auch die oströmischen Eliten zählten, gefördert worden sein. Welche Binnenkonflikte daraus erwuchsen, ließ sich bisher nicht aufzeigen., Den Baugrund der Stadt bildeten neben der Insel Rialto, die im frühen 9. Jahrhundert zum Kern Venedigs gemacht wurde, die benachbarten Luprio, Canaleclo, Gemine, Mendicola, Ombriola, Olivolo und Spinalunga. Dichte Pfahlroste aus Baumstämmen wurden in den Untergrund gerammt, um die Siedlungen zu erweitern. Die Flotte verschlang ebenfalls große Mengen Holz., Byzantinische Herrschaft., Mit der Eroberung des Ostgotenreiches unter Kaiser Justinian I. (\\"Restauratio imperii\\" ca. 535 bis 562) kam die Lagune unter oströmisch-byzantinische Herrschaft. Die Eroberung großer Teile Italiens durch die Langobarden ab 569 zwang jedoch Kaiser Maurikios, den verbliebenen Randprovinzen größere Eigenständigkeit zu gewähren, und so wurde Ende des 6. Jahrhunderts das Exarchat von Ravenna geschaffen. Der Exarch ernannte den Magister militum als militärischen und zivilen Oberbefehlshaber der Provinz. Ihm unterstanden in der Lagune wiederum Tribunen. Provinzhauptstadt war zunächst Oderzo, das jedoch 639 von den Langobarden erobert und 666 zerstört wurde. Damit löste sich die Provinz weitgehend auf und die Lagune war zunehmend auf sich selbst gestellt. Der Bischofssitz wurde 635 von Altinum in das sicherere Torcello verlegt. Dennoch spielte der Handel mit dem Festland, vor allem mit Salz und Getreide, bereits im 6. Jahrhundert eine wichtige Rolle, die im 8. Jahrhundert offenbar noch zunahm. Im Gegensatz zu den Standesgenossen außerhalb Venedigs erwarb der venezianische Adel, der sich überwiegend auf römische Wurzeln zurückführte, wohl um 800 bereits sein Vermögen nicht nur aus immobilem Besitz, sondern zunehmend im Handel., Paulicius wurde 697 – folgt man der Überlieferung – zum ersten Dogen erhoben. Wenige Jahrzehnte später wird erstmals ein \\"Dux\\" (Führer oder Herzog) Ursus erwähnt. Die Verlegung seines Amtssitzes erfolgte unter seinen Nachfolgern zunächst nach Heraclea und später nach Alt Malamocco. 811 wurde während der Amtszeit des Dogen Agnello Particiaco Rialto zum endgültigen Amtssitz., Bei der Wahl des ersten Dogen erscheinen entsprechend der venezianischen Tradition zum ersten Mal die so genannten zwölf „apostolischen“ Familien der Badoer, Barozzi, Contarini, Dandolo, Falier, Gradenigo, Memmo, Michiel, Morosini, Polani, Sanudo und Tiepolo., Von Byzanz zunehmend unabhängig zeigte sich Venedig erstmals im beginnenden byzantinischen Bilderstreit (726/27), als sich die Stadt auf die päpstliche Seite stellte. Darüber hinaus kam es erstmals zu einem Vertrag aus eigener Autorität, also ohne byzantinische Bestätigung, mit den Langobarden. In diesem Zusammenhang soll der Doge den Beinamen „Ipato“ (griech. \\"Hypatos\\"), also „Konsul“ erhalten haben, allerdings wohl nicht, wie vielfach angenommen, in Anerkennung seiner Verdienste bei der Rückeroberung Ravennas und der Pentapolis nach 729. Die Rückeroberung fand wohl 739/740 statt. Bereits 732 wurden die Orte der Lagune einem eigenen Bischof unterstellt, was ihre Zusammengehörigkeit verstärkt haben wird und sie zugleich deutlicher sichtbar machte., Zwischen Byzanz, den Langobarden und dem Frankenreich., Mit der zweiten Eroberung Ravennas durch die Langobarden (751) war die byzantinische Herrschaft in Oberitalien beendet. Trotzdem wusste Venedig die weiterhin bestehende formale Abhängigkeit von Byzanz zu schätzen, denn nur diese versetzte es in die Lage, seine Unabhängigkeit zu bewahren: zunächst gegenüber den Langobarden, aber mehr noch gegenüber den Franken (der fränkische König Karl der Große eroberte 774 das Langobardenreich). Dessen Sohn, König Pippin von Italien, unternahm zwischen 803 und 810 mehrere Versuche, Venedig zu erobern, auch eine Belagerung der Stadt blieb am Ende erfolglos., Im Frieden von Aachen wurde Venedig 812 schließlich als Teil des Byzantinischen Reiches anerkannt. Dies und die Verlegung des Dogensitzes an die Stelle des heutigen Dogenpalastes um 810 bildeten Grundlagen für die spätere Sonderentwicklung der Stadt gegenüber dem übrigen Italien., Innerhalb der Lagune, dessen Hauptstadt nun erst Venedig war, herrschte während dieses Prozesses keineswegs Einmütigkeit. Der vierte Doge Diodato, Sohn des wahrscheinlich ersten Dogen Orso, fiel 756 offenbar den Kämpfen zwischen prolangobardischer und probyzantinischer Fraktion zum Opfer. Auch der probyzantinische Nachfolger Galla, der ihn gestürzt hatte, fiel nach wenigen Monaten einem Attentat zum Opfer. Domenico Monegario wiederum führte bis zu seinem Sturz im Jahr 764 eine prolangobardische Fraktion, was dem oberitalienischen Handel Venedigs zugutekam. Zugleich wurden erste Versuche unternommen, die Macht des Dogen durch zwei Tribunen zu beschränken. Maurizio Galbaio, der von 764 bis 787 das Dogenamt innehatte, versuchte gegen starke Widerstände eine Dogendynastie durchzusetzen, indem er seinen Sohn Giovanni zum Nachfolger machte. Doch dieser überwarf sich mit dem Klerus der Stadt und unterlag schließlich einer profränkischen Fraktion unter der Führung des Obelerio, der dann allerdings im Vorfeld der Belagerung durch König Pippin, einen Sohn Karls des Großen, mitsamt seiner Familie 804 fliehen musste., Unter der Dynastie der Particiaco machte die Vergrößerung der Stadt deutliche Fortschritte. Ihr Selbstbewusstsein wuchs, aber es fehlte noch eine spirituelle Erhöhung, ein Symbol für die Bedeutung der Stadt., Nach dem Raub der Markusreliquien aus Alexandria (828), wo sich bereits eine venezianische Kaufmannskolonie befand, wurde der Evangelist Markus Schutzpatron: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Markuslöwe, Kolonialreich, Handelsmacht, Adelsrepublik, Geschichtsschreibung, Seemacht, Konkurrenz, Baugrund, Byzantinische Herrschaft, Unabhängigkeit"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Konflikt 1940, Luftkriegsoperation der Luftwaffe im Zweiten Weltkrieg, Luftkriegsoperation der Royal Air Force im Zweiten Weltkrieg, Luftschlacht, Schlacht des Zweiten Weltkriegs], Die Luftschlacht um England (\\"England\\" steht hier für das gesamte Vereinigte Königreich, vgl. Pars pro toto) war der Versuch der deutschen Luftwaffe, im Zweiten Weltkrieg nach dem Sieg über Frankreich zwischen Sommer 1940 und Anfang 1941 mit Luftangriffen gegen die britischen Streitkräfte und britische Städte die Kapitulation des Vereinigten Königreichs zu erzwingen bzw. durch die Erringung der Luftüberlegenheit die geplante Invasion der Insel vorzubereiten. International bekannt als \\"Battle of Britain\\" (\\"Schlacht um [Groß-]Britannien\\"), war die Luftschlacht eine Serie von Gefechten im britischen Luftraum, die von der deutschen Luftwaffe gegen die Royal Air Force (RAF) geführt wurde. Britische Historiker legen den Zeitraum der Schlacht vom 10. Juli bis zum 31. Oktober 1940 fest, da ab diesem Tag die Tagangriffe in größerem Ausmaß ausblieben. Manche Quellen und Statistiken beziehen sich auf einen Zeitraum bis zum Mai 1941, als die Kampfgeschwader der Luftwaffe für das Unternehmen Barbarossa abgezogen wurden., Ziel des Oberkommandos der Wehrmacht war die Erringung der Luftherrschaft über den britischen Luftraum durch die Vernichtung der Royal Air Force (RAF). Dies galt als Grundvoraussetzung für eine erfolgreiche Invasion, deren Planung bereits im Dezember 1939 zwischen Hitler und Großadmiral Raeder besprochen worden war (Unternehmen Seelöwe). Hitler hoffte jedoch später, das Vereinigte Königreich durch verstärktes Bombardement zu Friedensverhandlungen zwingen zu können; Ende September 1940 wurden die Invasionspläne intern auf unbestimmte Zeit verschoben, also faktisch aufgegeben., Der Begriff \\"Battle of Britain\\" wurde vom britischen Premierminister Winston Churchill geprägt, der am 18. Juni 1940 in einer Rede vor dem Unterhaus erklärte:, Hintergrund., In den 1930er-Jahren wurde die Rolle der Luftstreitkräfte in einem künftigen Krieg von führenden Militärs ebenso wie von Politikern als entscheidend angesehen., Diese Meinung stützte sich auf die Erfolge der im Ersten Weltkrieg von deutschen Luftschiffen und Bombern auf Großbritannien durchgeführten Bombenangriffe. Sie hatten trotz der geringen Zahl eingesetzter Luftfahrzeuge und der kleinen abgeworfenen Bombenlasten die britische Rüstungsproduktion spürbar geschädigt und den Abzug bedeutender britischer Kräfte von der Westfront nötig gemacht. Der Schaden an zerstörtem Gerät und der Ausfall der getroffenen Betriebe wurde dabei weit übertroffen durch den Produktionsausfall, der dadurch verursacht wurde, dass Fabrikarbeiter aus Furcht vor weiteren Bombenangriffen nicht am Arbeitsplatz erschienen. Dies machte in der Planung des Luftkrieges die Moral der Bevölkerung zu einem wichtigen Faktor., Die Entwicklung der Luftfahrttechnik und der Technik des Verbrennungsmotors (höhere Leistungsdichte) führte außerdem dazu, dass in den 1920er- und 1930er-Jahren größere und schnellere Bomber mit schwererer Bombenlast als im Ersten Weltkrieg gebaut werden konnten. Militärs und Politiker erwarteten daher, dass die Wirkung zukünftiger Bombenangriffe die im Ersten Weltkrieg beobachteten Effekte weit übertreffen würde., Durch den geringen Leistungsvorsprung der in der Zwischenkriegszeit gebauten Jagdflugzeuge gegenüber den Bombern und das Fehlen eines funktionsfähigen Luftraumüberwachungssystems nahm man an, dass es den feindlichen Jagdflugzeugen selten gelingen würde, die Bomber überhaupt abzufangen. Sollten die Jagdflugzeuge doch einmal in Schussposition gelangen, wurde erwartet, dass die Bomber aufgrund ihrer verbesserten Abwehrbewaffnung bei gegenseitiger Feuerunterstützung im engen Formationsflug alle Angriffe von Jagdflugzeugen abwehren könnten., Der einflussreiche britische Politiker Stanley Baldwin äußerte 1932: \\"„Der Bomber wird immer [zum Ziel] durchkommen“\\" und drückte die damals verbreitete Ansicht aus, ein zukünftiger Krieg würde durch Luftangriffe auf die Zivilbevölkerung entschieden werden. Gemäß der 1928 formulierten Trenchard-Doktrin nahm man an, dass Bombenangriffe auf \\"„alle Objekte, die wirksam zur Zerstörung der gegnerischen Mittel des Angriffs beitragen und seine Entschlossenheit zum Kampf verringern“\\" strategisch günstiger seien, als gegen feindliche Streitkräfte in direkter Feldschlacht vorzugehen, und begann bereits mit der Entwicklung der Stabbrandbombe, der Hauptwaffe des späteren Bombenkrieges und dem Auslöser von über 20 Feuerstürmen in deutschen Großstädten ab Frühjahr 1943., Als 1934 ein Krieg gegen das seit 1933 von Hitler geführte und stark aufrüstende Deutsche Reich absehbar wurde, formulierte die britische Regierung einen auf fünf Jahre angelegten Plan zur Erweiterung der britischen Luftstreitkräfte. Er sah sowohl die Aufstellung einer starken Streitmacht von Bombern zum Angriff auf Deutschland als auch die Schaffung eines Luftverteidigungssystems zur Abwehr deutscher Bombenangriffe vor. Dieser Plan wurde in wesentlichen Teilen entsprechend dem ursprünglichen Entwurf umgesetzt. Der Aufbau eines Netzes von Militärflugplätzen in Südengland und die Ausbildung eines Kaders von Kampfpiloten und Besatzungen hatten dabei Priorität. Die Ausrüstung der Royal Air Force mit modernen Kampfflugzeugen konnte dagegen erst gegen Ende des Planungszeitraums stattfinden., Das Fehlen genügend starker und einsatzbereiter Luftstreitkräfte in den 1930er Jahren beeinflusste die britische Politik und wird häufig als einer der Gründe für Chamberlains Appeasement-Politik angesehen. Umgekehrt war sich das Deutsche Reich der von seiner neu geschaffenen Luftwaffe ausgehenden Drohwirkung voll bewusst und nutzte sie zur Unterstützung seiner expansiven Politik. Dass zur Luftverteidigung eine Radarkette an der englischen Südküste aufgebaut wurde (siehe Chain Home), blieb den Deutschen verborgen., Schon die ersten Monate des Zweiten Weltkriegs zeigten, dass die Erwartungen an die Kampfkraft von Bombern viel zu hoch gewesen waren. Bereits 1939 wurde durch britische Angriffe auf deutsche Kriegsschiffe und Marinestützpunkte an der Nordsee deutlich, dass durch Suchradar geführte Jagdflugzeuge jetzt Bomber zum Kampf stellen und den Bomberformationen trotz ihrer Abwehrbewaffnung vernichtende Verluste zufügen könnten, so etwa im Dezember 1939 im Luftgefecht über der Deutschen Bucht. Diese Schlussfolgerung ließ britische Luftverteidigungssysteme als wesentlich wichtiger erscheinen, als man vor dem Krieg erwartet hatte. Zugleich hatten sich Bomberangriffe als weniger wirkungsvoll erwiesen als gedacht., Trotzdem hielten die Briten an der Erwartung fest, Bombenangriffe gegen die Zivilbevölkerung würden kriegsentscheidend sein (ab 1942 „morale bombing“ genannt). Auch die deutschen Luftangriffe während der darauf folgenden Luftschlacht um England richteten sich in der Endphase, von der die Entscheidung erwartet wurde, gegen den Großraum London („The Blitz“) und damit gegen die Zivilbevölkerung Großbritanniens., Hitler war offenbar unentschlossen Großbritannien anzugreifen., Ausgangssituation., Seitdem 1934 der Erweiterungsplan für die Royal Air Force (RAF) unter dem Namen \\"Plan A\\" verabschiedet worden war, arbeiteten die Briten systematisch am Aufbau einer modernen Luftwaffe. Die wichtigsten Schritte waren dabei der Ausbau eines Netzwerks von Fliegerhorsten, der Aufbau einer Basis von geschultem Bodenpersonal und eines Kaders von Piloten, und später – etwa in den zwei Jahren zwischen dem Münchner Abkommen und der Luftschlacht um England – die Ausrüstung der RAF mit modernen Bombern und Jagdflugzeugen., Am 1. September 1939 griff das Deutsche Reich Polen an, Frankreich und Großbritannien erklärten Deutschland am 3. September den Krieg, der Zweite Weltkrieg hatte begonnen., In mehreren \\"Blitzkriegen\\" konnte Deutschland 1940 den Alliierten massive Verluste zufügen und während des Westfeldzugs die Beneluxländer und weite Teile Frankreichs besetzen. Die britischen Truppen auf dem Festland wurden bei der nordfranzösischen Hafenstadt Dünkirchen eingekesselt, konnten jedoch in der Operation Dynamo gerade noch vor der Vernichtung gerettet werden. Die Rettung der Expeditionsarmee von ca. 240.000 Soldaten und von 100.000 weiteren Soldaten verbündeter Staaten förderte sehr die britische Moral. Da bei der Evakuierung alle schweren Waffen zurückgelassen werden mussten, war die erfolgreiche Verteidigung der britischen Inseln gegen eine deutsche Invasion noch nicht sicher. Der überragende Abwehrerfolg weniger Tage bildete aber die entscheidende Grundlage für Churchills kategorisches \\"Nein\\", mit dem Deutschen Reich Friedensverhandlungen aufzunehmen und war der frühzeitige Anfang vom Ende des Invasionsplans gegen England. Hitler entschloss sich zu dem Angriff auf die Sowjetunion, den ideologischen Hauptgegner, ohne vorher den Gegner im Westen besiegt zu haben oder mit ihm zu einem \\"modus vivendi\\" gekommen zu sein., Am 22. Juni 1940 wurde zwischen der französischen Armee und der deutschen Wehrmacht ein Waffenstillstand unterzeichnet, sehr zur Enttäuschung Großbritanniens, im selben Monat gelang es der deutschen Wehrmacht die Kanalinseln (Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney, Sark und Herm) als einziges britisches Gebiet bis Kriegsende 1945 zu besetzen., Begründet durch den schnellen Sieg über alle Kriegsgegner außer Großbritannien wurden von Hitler Signale erwartet, die den Wunsch auf Beendigung der Kampfhandlungen seitens der Briten ausdrückten. Tatsächlich gab es politische und populäre Strömungen, die dazu bereit waren., Doch Arthur Neville Chamberlain, der bis dahin die Appeasement-Politik vertreten hatte, war am 10. Mai 1940 als Premierminister zurückgetreten, und der energische Winston Churchill trat an seine Stelle. Er stellte am 13. Mai klar, dass der \\"„Krieg gegen eine monströse Tyrannei, wie sie nie übertroffen worden ist, im finsteren Katalog der Verbrechen der Menschheit“\\" nur mit einem \\"„Sieg um jeden Preis“\\" beendet werden dürfe. Die Angriffe der britischen RAF auf deutsche Städte begannen mit dem Angriff auf Mönchengladbach am 11. Mai 1940 mit 35 Bombern., Am 16. Juli 1940 gab Hitler den Befehl zur Vorbereitung des Unternehmens Seelöwe. Um diesen Plan durchführen zu können, war sich der deutsche Generalstab sicher, müsse man erst die Luftherrschaft über England gewinnen., Hitlers Appell an die \\"Vernunft\\" Englands, es könne weiteres Blutvergießen vermieden werden, ausgesprochen in einer Rede vor dem Reichstag am 19. Juli, führte zu keiner Reaktion., Aus heutiger Sicht wird der Plan zur Landung in Großbritannien als unrealistisch angesehen. Weder die Ausrüstung der Kriegsmarine noch des Heeres war für dieses Vorhaben geeignet.

Sie gehört zu den Aerophonen. Zur Abgrenzung gegenüber elektronischen Orgeln wird sie auch \\"Pfeifenorgel\\" genannt., Der Klang wird durch skalamäßig angeordnete Eintonpfeifen erzeugt, die durch einen Orgelwind genannten Luftstrom angeblasen werden. Die meisten Orgeln enthalten mehrheitlich Labialpfeifen (Lippenpfeifen), bei denen die Luftsäule im Innern durch Anblasen eines Labiums (wie bei der Blockflöte) zum Schwingen gebracht und damit der Ton erzeugt wird. Sie werden oft durch Lingualpfeifen (Zungenpfeifen) ergänzt, bei denen die Tonerzeugung (wie bei der Klarinette) durch ein schwingendes Zungenblatt erfolgt., Die drei Hauptteile der Orgel sind: das Pfeifenwerk, das Windwerk (Gebläse, Bälge, Kanäle, Windkasten, Windladen) und das Regierwerk, d.h. der Mechanismus, welcher dem Wind den Zugang zu den einzelnen Pfeifen öffnet (Spieltisch, Spieltraktur, Registertraktur). Der Organist bedient die Orgel vom Spieltisch aus. Die Töne werden über ein oder mehrere Manuale und gegebenenfalls das Pedal angesteuert, denen die Register meist fest zugeordnet sind. Dabei wird die Bewegung der Tasten über die Traktur mechanisch, pneumatisch, elektrisch oder durch Lichtwellen (Glasfaser) zu den Ventilen unter den Pfeifen geleitet. Mit den Registerzügen oder -schaltern ruft der Organist einzelne Pfeifenreihen verschiedener Tonhöhe und Klangfarbe (Register) auf und erzeugt so verschiedene Klangmischungen., Dazu treten als Rahmen das Gehäuse und der Prospekt., Orgeln sind seit der Antike bekannt und haben sich besonders im Barock und zur Zeit der Romantik zu ihrer heutigen Form entwickelt. Deutschland weist mit rund 50.000 Orgeln weltweit die höchste Dichte an Pfeifenorgeln bezogen auf Fläche und Einwohnerzahl auf. Die UNESCO hat Orgelbau und Orgelmusik 2017 in die Liste des Immateriellen Kulturerbes aufgenommen., Funktionen, Arten und Orte., Liturgischer und weltlicher Einsatz., Sehr viele Orgeln erfüllen liturgische und konzertante Aufgaben in Kirchen und Synagogen des liberalen Judentums. Sie befinden sich auch in Konzertsälen, Musikhochschulen (Übeorgel), Schulen (Schulorgel) und Privathäusern (Hausorgel)., Kleine und große Orgeln., Eine kleine, einmanualige Orgel ohne Pedal bezeichnet man als Positiv oder –bei kompakter Bauweise– als Truhenorgel. Tragbare Kleinstorgeln bezeichnet man als Portativ. Eine Spezialform ist das nur mit Zungenpfeifen disponierte \\"Regal\\"., Größere Orgeln verfügen in der Regel über viele Register, von Großorgeln spricht man ab etwa hundert Registern. Als derzeit größte Orgel der Welt gilt die Orgel der Atlantic City Convention Hall mit 314 Registern und 33.114 Pfeifen. Ihren einstigen Rang als lauteste Orgel der Welt musste sie inzwischen an die nur einregistrige Freiluftorgel Vox Maris in Yeosu (Südkorea) abtreten, die 138,4dBA erreicht., Räume und Akustik., Der Orgelbauer hat die komplexe Aufgabe, das Instrument akustisch, optisch und funktional möglichst optimal aufzustellen, was jedoch oftmals durch bauliche Gegebenheiten nur begrenzt möglich ist. Idealerweise sollte der Orgelklang in jedem Punkt des Raumes ausgeglichen und transparent sein. Der Nachhall sollte das Klangbild nicht zu sehr verschleiern., In Kirchen verrät die Aufstellung einer Orgel oft viel über ihre liturgische Bestimmung und ihre Einsatzmöglichkeiten. Während die ältesten Instrumente oftmals in der Nähe des Chores oder als Schwalbennestorgeln erscheinen, so wird ab dem 17.Jahrhundert die Orgel an der Westwand gebräuchlich. Traditionell war die Chororgel (oder in Italien/Spanien das Evangelien/Epistel-Orgelpaar) für eine katholische Liturgie bestimmt, die sich großteils im Chorraum der Kirche abspielte. Als nach der Reformation der Gemeindegesang an Bedeutung gewann, wanderte die Orgel an die Westwand auf die Orgelempore (seltener hinter oder über den Altar als Altarorgel) und wurde auch tendenziell größer und lauter, denn nun musste sie eine in einer gefüllten Kirche singende Gemeinde führen können. Je nach Aufstellungsort werden Orgeln auch als Langhausorgeln oder Querhausorgeln bezeichnet. In kleinen Kirchenräumen oder solchen mit besonderen architektonischen Eigenheiten muss die Orgel oft unabhängig von ihrer liturgischen Bedeutung an die Architektur angepasst aufgestellt werden., Die Größe der Orgelempore sagt viel über die Bestimmung der Orgel aus. So war es beispielsweise in den großen Kirchen Mitteldeutschlands im 18.Jahrhundert oft üblich, auf der Orgelempore Chor und Instrumentalensemble zu platzieren, wodurch die Hauptorgel auch als Begleitinstrument eingesetzt wurde., Zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts wurden sogenannte Dachbodenorgeln über dem Kirchenschiff in dafür errichteten Orgelkammern aufgestellt., In Konzertsälen ist die Orgel zumeist an der Wand über dem Orchesterpodium angebracht., Orgelbau., Werkstoffe., Der traditionelle, für den Bau einer Orgel hauptsächlich verwendete Werkstoff ist Holz. Aus Holz werden das Gehäuse, die Windladen, die Tasten und ein Teil der Pfeifen gefertigt. Bei Instrumenten mit einer mechanischen Steuerung (Traktur) findet Holz oft auch für die Mechanikteile Verwendung. Für die Metallpfeifen kommen meist Zinn-Blei-Legierungen zum Einsatz (sogenanntes Orgelmetall), seit dem 19.Jahrhundert auch Zink und im 20.Jahrhundert Kupfer (vereinzelt auch Porzellan, Plexiglas und andere Kunststoffe). Für die Beläge der Klaviatur werden Rinderknochen (selten Elfenbein) sowie verschiedene Hölzer (Ebenholz, geschwärzter Birnbaum, Grenadill) verwendet., Pfeifenwerk und Register., Das Pfeifenwerk der Orgel besteht aus mehreren Pfeifenreihen, in denen jeweils Orgelpfeifen gleicher Bauart und Klangfarbe stehen. Eine Pfeifenreihe (manchmal auch mehrere) wird zu einem Register zusammengefasst, das vom Spieltisch aus an- und abgeschaltet werden kann. Die Bedienung der Register erfolgt bei der mechanischen Traktur über Registerzüge oder Manubrien genannte Knäufe, die man zum Einschalten herausziehen und zum Abschalten wieder hineinschieben muss; daher rühren die alten Bezeichnungen „Ziehen“ und „Abstoßen“ für das Ein- und Ausschalten von Registern. Bei der elektrischen und der pneumatischen Traktur werden die Register mittels Taster oder Schalter ein- und ausgeschaltet., Die Zusammenstellung der Register einer Orgel einschließlich der Spielhilfen (Koppeln etc.), nennt man die Disposition einer Orgel. Sie wird vom Orgelbauer beim Erstellen des Instrumentes mit dem Auftraggeber abgesprochen und bestimmt die Einsatzmöglichkeiten der Orgel., Durch planvolles Kombinieren verschiedener Register, die sogenannte Registrierung, können unterschiedliche Klangfarben und Lautstärken eingestellt werden. Die Kunst des Organisten besteht darin, aus dem vorhandenen Klangbestand eine Registrierung zu finden, die der zu spielenden Musik am besten entspricht. Jede Epoche bevorzugte ein jeweils eigenes, spezielles Klangbild, das der gut geschulte Organist kennt. Man kann daher nicht auf jedem Instrument jedes Stück im historischen Sinne stilgetreu interpretieren. Trotz der Möglichkeit einer gewissen Typisierung gibt es selten zwei gleiche Orgeln, da jedes Instrument in Größe und Ausführung an seinen Aufstellungsraum angepasst oder vom Geschmack der Zeit seiner Entstehung abhängig ist., Unterscheidung nach Tonhöhe., Die Register können verschiedene Tonhöhen haben, wobei die Tonhöhe durch die sogenannte Fußtonzahl angegeben wird. So bezeichnet man ein Register in Normallage (d.h., die Taste c1 bringt den Ton c1 zum Klingen) als 8′-(Acht-Fuß)-Register, da die Länge der tiefsten Pfeife, groß C, eines offenen Labialregisters ungefähr 8\\"Fuß\\" beträgt (1Fuß = ca.30cm). Ein um eine Oktave tieferes Register ist ein 16′-Register mit oft doppelt so langen Pfeifen, 4′ bezeichnet ein um eine Oktave höheres Register und hat meist nur halb so lange Pfeifen wie ein 8′-Register. Quinten haben stets Fußtonzahlen mit Drittel-Brüchen (bspw. ′ oder ′ – es handelt sich um den 3. Teilton der natürlichen Obertonskala), Terzen mit Fünftel-Brüchen (z.B. ′ – 5. Teilton). Darüber hinaus gibt es Septimen (z.B. ′) mit dem 7. Teilton, Nonen (z.B. ′) mit dem 9. Teilton und weitere höhere Partialtonregister., Die verschiedenen Tonlagen bilden die Obertonreihe ab. Durch Kombination eines Grundregisters (in der Regel 8′-Lage) mit einem oder mehreren Obertonregistern (etwa ′ oder ′), die auch \\"Aliquoten\\" genannt werden, werden vorhandene Obertöne verstärkt (bzw. fehlende Obertöne hinzugefügt), wodurch sich die Klangfarbe ändert., Unterscheidung nach Bauart., Die Register unterscheiden sich neben der Tonhöhe (Fußlage) auch durch ihre Bauart und damit durch Tonansatz, Obertonanteil (Klangfarbe) und Lautstärke., Nach der Art der Tonerzeugung unterscheidet man zwischen Lippenpfeifen oder Labialen (Tonerzeugung wie bei der Blockflöte) und Zungenpfeifen oder Lingualen (Tonerzeugung wie bei einer Klarinette). Labialpfeifen können offen oder gedackt sein; die gedackten Pfeifen klingen bei gleicher Länge eine Oktave tiefer. Weitere Unterschiede gibt es bei Materialien, der Pfeifenform und der Mensur (den Verhältnissen der verschiedenen Pfeifenabmessungen). Daneben gibt es die gemischten Stimmen. Dabei handelt es sich um Register, bei denen für jede Taste mehrere Pfeifen erklingen. Dazu gehören etwa die Klangkronen oder Mixturen und Farbregister wie die Sesquialtera und das Kornett., Die physikalischen Erklärungen zum Einfluss der Bauform der Pfeifen auf die Klangfarbe sind im Artikel Orgelpfeife genauer ausgeführt., Nebenregister., Bei den Registerzügen eingeordnet ist der Tremulant. Er verändert periodisch den Winddruck und sorgt so für ein Schwingen des Tones, meist als kombiniertes Tremolo und Vibrato. In Orgeln neuerer Zeit ist die Geschwindigkeit der Schwingung mitunter einstellbar. Der Tremulant wirkt auf alle Register des Werkes, in das er eingebaut ist. Bei alten Orgeln gibt es manchmal einen Tremulanten für die gesamte Orgel, mitunter auch einen, der nur auf ein bestimmtes Register wirkt (etwa Schwebeflöte oder Vox humana)., Spezielle Effektregister, wie Glockenspiele, Kuckuck, Vogelgesang, Donner oder Pauken, ergänzen bei manchen Orgeln die Disposition., Windwerk., Die zugeführte komprimierte Luft, der sogenannte Wind, wurde bis gegen: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"- Orgel - Tasteninstrument - Aerophon - Pfeifenorgel - Register - Labialpfeifen - Lingualpfeifen - Manuale - Pedal - Gehäuse"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Autoimmunerkrankung, Krankheitsbild in der Augenheilkunde, Schilddrüse], Die endokrine Orbitopathie (von ‚Kreis‘ und ; \\"endokrin\\" ‚nach innen abgebend‘; Synonyme endokrine Ophthalmopathie, \\"EO\\") ist eine Erkrankung der Augenhöhle (Orbita). Sie zählt zu den organspezifischen Autoimmunerkrankungen und tritt meist gemeinsam mit einer Schilddrüsenfehlfunktion auf (endokrin), wobei Frauen erheblich häufiger betroffen sind als Männer., Klinisch äußert sie sich mit einem deutlichen Hervortreten der Augen (Exophthalmus), hochgezogenen Oberlidern (Lidretraktion) und einer damit verbundenen Erweiterung der Lidspalten. Auslöser für dieses auffällige Krankheitszeichen sind strukturelle und größenmäßige Veränderungen des hinter dem Augapfel \\"(retrobulbär)\\" gelegenen Muskel-, Fett- und Bindegewebes., Zusammen mit \\"Herzrasen\\" (Tachykardie) und einer \\"Vergrößerung\\" der Schilddrüse (Struma) bildet der Exophthalmus die sogenannte \\"Merseburger Trias\\", einen dreiteiligen \\"(Trias)\\" Symptomkomplex. Dieser gehört zu den klassischen, aber nicht zwingenden klinischen Zeichen des Morbus Basedow und wurde bereits 1840 von Carl Adolph von Basedow, der seinerzeit in Merseburg tätig war, beschrieben., Der Krankheitsverlauf weist unterschiedliche \\"Schwere-\\" und \\"Aktivitätsgrade\\" auf. Wegen des auffälligen kosmetischen Erscheinungsbildes können sich zu den \\"organischen\\" und \\"funktionellen\\" Problemen auch starke \\"psychosoziale\\" Belastungen gesellen, unter denen Betroffene zu leiden haben. Zwar existieren eine ganze Reihe von symptomatischen Behandlungsmaßnahmen, eine die Ursachen behebende \\"(kausale)\\" Therapie ist bislang jedoch nicht bekannt., Ursache und Häufigkeit., Die Ursache der endokrinen Orbitopathie ist bis heute unbekannt. Als wahrscheinlich gilt eine erblich bedingte Autoimmunerkrankung, die für die Bildung von Autoantikörpern gegen Thyreotropin-Rezeptoren verantwortlich ist (das Hormon Thyreotropin, kurz TSH, beeinflusst maßgeblich das Schilddrüsenwachstum). Diese Rezeptoren finden sich auch im Gewebe der Augenhöhle., Die endokrine Orbitopathie kommt bei 10 % aller Schilddrüsenerkrankten vor und tritt in bis zu über 90 % der Fälle gleichzeitig im Rahmen eines Morbus Basedow, dabei zu 60 % in Verbindung mit einer Schilddrüsenüberfunktion (Hyperthyreose) auf. Für die Häufigkeit (Prävalenz) des Morbus Basedow in Deutschland gibt es allerdings keine genauen Angaben. In Gebieten mit ausreichender Jodversorgung wird diese bei Frauen mit 2 bis 3 % und bei Männern mit ungefähr einem Zehntel davon angegeben. Die jährliche Neuerkrankungsrate des Morbus Basedow liegt bei 1 pro 1.000 Einwohner., Die endokrine Orbitopathie kann sich jedoch auch zeitlich vor oder erst Jahre nach der Entstehung von Schilddrüsenstörungen entwickeln. Die endokrine Orbitopathie wird daher als außerhalb der Schilddrüse \\"(extrathyreoidal)\\" gelegene Manifestation der dem Morbus Basedow zugrundeliegenden Autoimmunprozesse interpretiert. Somit werden die gleichen Ursachen angenommen. Dabei spielen genetische Veranlagung, Umwelteinflüsse, deren Bedeutungen noch nicht eindeutig geklärt sind, und ein komplexer immunologischer Prozess eine Rolle. Auch unter Radiojodtherapie kann sich eine bis dato leichte, oder klinisch inapparente (unauffällige) endokrine Orbitopathie ausbilden oder deutlich verschlechtern., Nur selten findet sie sich jedoch auch bei einem Morbus Hashimoto oder gänzlich ohne Nachweis einer Schilddrüsenbeteiligung. Übermäßiger Nikotingenuss (Nikotinabusus) kann den Verlauf und Schweregrad der Krankheit negativ beeinflussen. Die endokrine Orbitopathie tritt bei Frauen sechsmal häufiger als bei Männern auf, wobei die schweren Fälle bei Männern deutlich überwiegen. Thyreotropin-Rezeptor-Autoantikörper \\"(TSH-Rezeptor-Antikörper)\\" korrelieren mit der Aktivität der Erkrankung und helfen, die Prognose einer endokrinen Orbitopathie einzuschätzen., Obgleich die endokrine Orbitopathie in den allermeisten Fällen mit Schilddrüsenerkrankungen einhergeht, ist ein ursächlicher Zusammenhang bisher nicht bewiesen, weshalb sie auch als eigenständige Autoimmunerkrankung betrachtet wird., Der im angloamerikanischen Sprachraum geläufige und synonym verwendete Begriff \\"Graves ophthalmopathy\\" stellt bereits einen direkten Zusammenhang zwischen dem gehäuften Auftreten dieser Augenerkrankung und einem Morbus Basedow (engl.: \\"Graves’ disease\\") her. Der irische Arzt Robert James Graves beschrieb bereits 1835 einen Fall von krankhafter Schilddrüsenvergrößerung (Struma) in Kombination mit einem Exophthalmus., Krankheitsentstehung., Das Auftreten einer endokrinen Orbitopathie ist die Folge von komplexen Abwehrmechanismen des Körpers gegen eigenes Gewebe (Autoimmunprozesse), die durch bestimmte Blutzellen, sogenannte B- und autoreaktive T-Lymphozyten, ausgelöst werden und mit einer vermehrten Bildung von Antikörpern (Thyreotropin-Rezeptor-Autoantikörpern, TRAK) einhergehen. Es gibt Hinweise darauf, dass TRAK mit stimulierenden Eigenschaften (\\"thyroid stimulating antibodies\\", TSAb) die Ausbildung einer endokrinen Orbitopathie besonders begünstigen, der genaue Mechanismus ist jedoch bislang nicht bekannt. Auch andere Rezeptor-Antikörper (z.B. die insulinähnlichen Wachstumsfaktoren) könnten eine Rolle spielen., Im Vergleich zu anderen Bereichen des Körpers reagieren bestimmte Bindegewebszellen, sogenannte Fibroblasten, im retrobulbären Gewebe besonders stark auf entzündungsartige Reize, insbesondere auf eine Stimulation spezieller Antigene, sogenannter CD40-Proteine, was zur Bildung neuer Fettzellen führt. Ebenfalls begünstigend wirken eine genetische Vorbelastung sowie Tabakkonsum., Die so ausgelöste immunologische Entzündung führt in der Augenhöhle zum Anschwellen des Muskel-, Fett- und Bindegewebes, verbreitert den Abstand zwischen Orbitawand und Augapfel und führt dadurch sowohl zu einem Hervortreten des Auges (Exophthalmus), als auch zu einem Elastizitätsverlust der Augenmuskeln mit Bewegungseinschränkungen und Doppelbildern. Maßgebliche Ursache für diesen Prozess sind Durchdringungen des Gewebes mit Lymphozyten (lymphozytäre Infiltrationen) sowie eine Zunahme der Fibroblasten. Darüber hinaus kommt es zur Vermehrung eines Bindegewebsbaustoffes, dem Kollagen, bei gleichzeitiger Zunahme weiterer eingelagerter Glykosaminoglykane und einer übermäßigen Ansammlung von Wasser im Gewebe. Eine typische Erscheinung der Augenmuskeln und seltener auch des Sehnerven ist zudem ein diffuses Fettgewebswachstum, eine sogenannte Lipomatose., Klinische Erscheinungen., Die endokrine Orbitopathie tritt ein- oder beidseitig auf, dann jedoch oft unterschiedlich stark ausgeprägt. Andere Quellen verweisen auf ein eher bilateral symmetrisches Krankheitsbild. Sie besitzt eine Reihe von sich dynamisch verändernden klinischen Merkmalen, die in aller Regel durch Entzündungen, strukturelle Wandlung und einer Volumenzunahme von hinter dem Auge gelegenem, orbitalem Fett-, Binde- und Muskelgewebe verursacht werden (\\"siehe auch:\\" Periorbita). Ist die endokrine Orbitopathie so stark ausgeprägt, dass ein vollständiger Lidschluss nicht mehr möglich ist (Lagophthalmus) und daher Hornhautgeschwüre auftreten, so spricht man von einem \\"malignen Exophthalmus\\"., Wie auch andere Erkrankungen kann die endokrine Orbitopathie die Betroffenen psychisch stark belasten. Neben den allgemeinen Beschwerden, den funktionellen Einschränkungen durch Doppelbilder und Kopfzwangshaltungen, die in der Regel deutliche Hindernisse in vielen Lebensbereichen darstellen können, kann der kosmetisch-ästhetische Aspekt zu einem \\"sozialen Rückzug\\" führen., Augenhöhle (Orbita)., Der Exophthalmus, das Hervortreten eines oder beider Augen aus der Augenhöhle, ist das klassische Leitsymptom der endokrinen Orbitopathie und Resultat einer schmerzhaften Ausbreitung von retrobulbärem Gewebe, das sich bis in die Augenlider vorwölben kann. In 3 % der Fälle kommt es darüber hinaus zu Weichteilschwellungen in der \\"Orbitaspitze\\" (z.B. Ödeme) und in Folge zu einer \\"Kompression\\" und somit Schädigung des Sehnerven mit Verschlechterung der Sehschärfe und entsprechenden Gesichtsfeldausfällen., Das Ausmaß des Exophthalmus lässt sich mit einem augenheilkundlichen Untersuchungsgerät, dem sogenannten Exophthalmometer, quantifizieren und erlaubt somit auch die Dokumentation von Verlauf und Status. Raumfordernde Prozesse und Platzverhältnisse in der Orbita können mit \\"bildgebenden\\" Verfahren (Ultraschall, CT, NMR) dargestellt werden. Eine Untersuchung von Gesichtsfeld und Sehschärfe erfolgt mittels Perimetrie und Sehtests., Augenmuskeln., Bewegungsstörungen entstehen durch Schwellung, Infiltration oder krankhafte Gewebevermehrung (Fibrosierung) der Augenmuskeln, wobei eine Vergrößerung bis auf das Zehnfache ihres üblichen Volumens möglich ist. Als Folge kommt es zu einem Elastizitätsverlust mit teils deutlich eingeschränkter Dehnbarkeit, häufig einhergehend mit Schmerzen bei Blickwendungen. Die Bewegungseinschränkungen treten nicht in Muskelzugrichtung als ein Ausdruck verminderter Muskelkraft auf, sondern in die entgegengesetzte Richtung, was sich quasi als \\"scheinbare\\" Lähmung (Pseudoparese) des gleichseitigen muskulären Gegenspielers (Antagonist) darstellt. Klinische Zeichen zum Beispiel sind die Einschränkung der monokularen Blickfelder, Schielen und Doppelbilder mit kompensatorischen Kopfzwangshaltungen. Ein weiteres, typisches Symptom ist das sogenannte Möbius-Zeichen, eine teils ausgeprägte Unfähigkeit, beide Augen gleichzeitig zur Nase hin zu bewegen (Konvergenzschwäche)., Unterschiedliche Motilitätsuntersuchungen und die Bestimmung der Bereiche, in denen doppelbildfrei mit beiden Augen einfach gesehen wird (Fusionsblickfelder), werden in der Regel apparativ an einem sogenannten Synoptometer oder im freien Raum an der \\"Tangententafel\\" (nach Harms) durchgeführt. Zur Bestimmung der maximalen Bewegungsfähigkeit des rechten und linken Auges \\"(monokulare Exkursionsstrecken)\\" kann auch eine Untersuchung der Folgebewegungen am Goldmann-Perimeter durchgeführt werden. Ein Pinzettenzugtest gibt Aufschluss über die \\"passive\\" Beweglichkeit des Auges. Da es beim Blick entgegengesetzt der Zugrichtung eines fibrosierten Muskels kurzfristig zu einem Anstieg des Augeninnendrucks kommt, kann die Durchführung von Augeninnendruck: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Jahrhundert, Messe von Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Musik 1791, Requiem, Unvollendetes musikalisches Werk], Das Requiem in d-Moll (KV 626) aus dem Jahr 1791 ist Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts letzte Komposition. Obwohl es nur zu etwa zwei Dritteln tatsächlich von Mozart stammt, ist es eines seiner beliebtesten und am höchsten eingeschätzten Werke. Mozart starb während der Komposition. Da es sich um ein Auftragswerk handelte, vervollständigten Joseph Eybler und Franz Xaver Süßmayr, ein Schüler von Mozart, das Requiem im Auftrag von Constanze Mozart, der Witwe des Komponisten. Die Entstehungsgeschichte und Qualität der nachträglichen Ergänzungen werden seit langem heftig diskutiert. Die ungewöhnlichen Umstände des Kompositionsauftrags und der zeitliche Zusammenhang dieser Seelenmesse mit Mozarts frühem Tod haben zudem eine üppige Mythenbildung angeregt., Zur Entstehungsgeschichte., In den letzten Jahren vor seinem Tod wandte sich Mozart verstärkt der Kirchenmusik zu – eine ganze Reihe von Kyrie-Fragmenten wird auf die Jahre 1787–1791 datiert. Er versuchte, sich im kirchenmusikalischen Fach ein Auskommen zu sichern, indem er sich im April 1791 erfolgreich als Adjunkt des Domkapellmeisters an St. Stephan in Wien, Leopold Hofmann, bewarb. Die Stelle war zwar unbezahlt, doch erwarb sich Mozart so die „Erwartung auf die 2000 Gulden eintragende Kapellmeisterstelle“, also die Zusicherung einer sehr lukrativen Position. Am 17. Juni 1791 komponierte Mozart die kurze Fronleichnams-Motette \\"Ave verum corpus\\" (KV 618). Ein Arbeitsauftrag für ein größeres Kirchenwerk musste ihm somit sehr entgegenkommen., Im Laufe des Jahres 1791 wurde Mozart durch Vermittler, die für den exzentrischen Grafen Franz von Walsegg agierten, mit der Komposition eines Requiems beauftragt und erhielt die Hälfte der Bezahlung im Voraus. Er hielt sich an die übliche Textgestalt des Requiems und verzichtete lediglich, wie das in den meisten musikalischen Bearbeitungen der Fall ist, auf eine Vertonung von \\"Graduale\\" und \\"Tractus\\". Als Vorbild mag das Requiem c-Moll von Michael Haydn gedient haben, an dessen Uraufführung Mozart als Fünfzehnjähriger im Orchester mitgewirkt hatte., Während des Kompositionsprozesses erkrankte Mozart schwer. Bis zu seinem Tod am 5.Dezember 1791 hatte er lediglich den Eröffnungssatz des Introitus \\"(Requiem aeternam)\\" mit allen Orchester- und Vokalstimmen niedergeschrieben. Das folgende \\"Kyrie\\" und der größte Teil der Dies-irae-Sequenz (vom \\"Dies irae\\" bis zum \\"Confutatis\\") waren lediglich in den Gesangsstimmen und dem bezifferten Bass fertiggestellt, darüber hinaus waren verschiedentlich einige wichtige Orchesterpartien (etwa Posaunensolo im \\"Tuba mirum\\", öfter Stimme der ersten Violinen) kurz skizziert. Der letzte Satz der Sequenz, das \\"Lacrimosa\\", brach nach acht Takten ab und blieb unvollständig. In den 1960er Jahren wurde eine Skizze für eine Amen-Fuge entdeckt, die offenbar die Sequenz nach dem \\"Lacrimosa\\" hätte beenden sollen. Die folgenden beiden Sätze des Offertorium, das \\"Domine Jesu Christe\\" und das \\"Hostias\\", waren wiederum in den Gesangsstimmen und teilweise im Continuo ausgearbeitet. Sanctus mit Benedictus, Agnus Dei und Communio fehlten völlig., Der Witwe Mozarts, Constanze Mozart, war verständlicherweise sehr daran gelegen, dass das unvollständige Werk abgeschlossen wurde, um die Vorauszahlung nicht zurückzahlen zu müssen und die zweite Hälfte der Kaufsumme zu erhalten. Sie beauftragte daher andere Komponisten, meist Schüler Mozarts, mit der Fertigstellung. Zunächst wandte sie sich an Joseph Eybler. Er arbeitete an der Instrumentation der Sätze vom \\"Dies irae\\" bis zum \\"Lacrimosa\\", gab den Auftrag dann aber aus unbekannten Gründen zurück. Seine Ergänzungen schrieb er direkt in Mozarts autografe Partitur., Die Arbeit wurde einem anderen jungen Komponisten und Schüler Mozarts anvertraut, Franz Xaver Süßmayr, der sich für die Instrumentation auf Eyblers Arbeit stützen konnte. Süßmayr komplettierte die Orchestrierung der \\"Sequenz\\" sowie des \\"Offertoriums\\", stellte das \\"Lacrimosa\\" fertig und komponierte weitere Sätze: \\"Sanctus\\", \\"Benedictus\\" und \\"Agnus Dei\\". Dann ergänzte er die \\"Communio\\" \\"(Lux aeterna)\\", indem er die beiden Eröffnungssätze, die Mozart noch selbst komponiert hatte, wiederholte und ihnen den Text des \\"Lux aeterna\\" unterlegte. Ob auch die Trompeten- und Paukenstimmen im \\"Kyrie\\" von Süßmayr stammen, ist heute umstritten., Während die Ergänzungen des \\"Kyrie\\" sowie Eyblers Instrumentation direkt in Mozarts Partitur eingetragen wurden, übertrug Süßmayr für den Rest des Werks Mozarts Notentext und auch (teilweise nach eigenen Vorstellungen verändert) Eyblers Ergänzungen auf neues Notenpapier. Es entstanden so zwei Partituren: die „Arbeitspartitur“, die nur Mozarts Handschrift und Eyblers Ergänzungen enthält und von Süßmayr als Arbeitsgrundlage benutzt wurde, und die „Ablieferungspartitur“ in der von Süßmayr fertiggestellten Fassung. Die letztere wurde mit einer (von Süßmayr) gefälschten Unterschrift Mozarts versehen, auf 1792 datiert und in diesem Jahr auch dem Boten des anonym gebliebenen Grafen Walsegg übergeben. Die entscheidenden Manuskripte, insbesondere die „Ablieferungspartitur“ und die „Arbeitspartitur“, fanden zwischen 1830 und 1840 nach und nach den Weg in die Wiener Hofbibliothek (heute Österreichische Nationalbibliothek)., Neben Eybler haben vermutlich auch noch weitere Komponisten an der Vervollständigung gearbeitet, deren Notizen Süßmayr wahrscheinlich ebenfalls nutzen konnte. So hat Maximilian Stadler offenbar zumindest Vorarbeiten zur Instrumentation des \\"Domine Jesu\\" geleistet. Die Begleitstimmen im Kyrie, die mit den Chorstimmen „mitgehen“ (colla-parte-Stimmen), stammen ebenfalls von einer anderen Hand; Leopold Nowak, der Herausgeber des Requiem-Bandes der Neuen Mozart-Ausgabe (NMA), hat Franz Jakob Freystädtler als Autor vermutet, was aber durch neuere Handschriftenbefunde ausgeschlossen werden kann., Da die neu hinzugekommenen, von Süßmayr stammenden Teile z.T. deutliche motivische Bezüge zum von Mozart stammenden Notentext haben und außerdem Anlehnungen an andere Kompositionen Mozarts entdeckt wurden, wird häufig angenommen, dass Süßmayr oder andere Beteiligte an dem Werk auf mündliche oder schriftliche Hinweise Mozarts zurückgreifen konnten (Mozarts Witwe hat „Trümmer“ bzw. „Zettelchen“ von Mozart erwähnt)., Zur Musik., Das Werk ist besetzt mit vier Vokalsolisten (Sopran, Alt, Tenor und Bass), vierstimmigem Chor und einem kleinen klassischen Orchester, bestehend aus zwei Bassetthörnern, zwei Fagotten, zwei Trompeten, drei Posaunen, Pauken, Streichorchester und Basso continuo (Orgel). Auffällig ist das Fehlen der hohen Holzbläser (Flöten, Oboen) und der Waldhörner. Der Klang des Orchesters wird somit stark durch den biegsamen, dunklen Ton der Bassetthörner bestimmt. So wird eine „durch die sparsame Instrumentation noch verstärkte starke Abdunklung und Transparenz erreicht, und eine düster-ernste Grundstimmung erzielt“., Im Vordergrund steht im Mozart-Requiem durchweg der vierstimmige Vokalsatz, es gibt nur kurze rein instrumentale Partien. Das Orchester hat mit wenigen Ausnahmen eher dienende Funktion. Auch die Vokalsolisten treten hinter dem Chor deutlich zurück und werden (außer im \\"Tuba mirum\\") im Wesentlichen als Ensemble eingesetzt. Arien und vergleichbare Formen solistischer Virtuosität fehlen ganz, anders als in anderen kirchenmusikalischen Werken oder gar Opern Mozarts und seiner Zeitgenossen. Der Chor erhält allerdings, zumindest im \\"Kyrie\\", erheblichen Raum zur Glanzentfaltung., Die Haupttonart des Requiems ist d-Moll, eine Tonart, die häufig (wie in den Komturszenen des Don Giovanni oder in Franz Schuberts Streichquartett \\"Der Tod und das Mädchen\\") ernsten oder auf das Jenseits bezogenen Dingen zugeordnet wird. Die Tonarten bewegen sich (mit Ausnahme des nicht von Mozart stammenden \\"Sanctus\\" in D-Dur) größtenteils im Bereich von oft mit Dunkelheit, Emotion, Romantik, und Sterben assoziierten B-Tonarten (neben d-Moll etwa F-Dur, g-Moll, Es-Dur, B-Dur, auch a-Moll). Häufig sind die Anschlüsse der Sätze terzverwandt (etwa von d-Moll nach B-Dur)., Die Aufführungsdauer beträgt etwa eine Stunde (je nach Version der Vervollständigung und dem vom Dirigenten gewählten Tempo)., Werkgestalt., Die hier angegebene Gliederung gibt diejenige der traditionellen Vervollständigung durch Franz Xaver Süßmayr wieder. Das Ordinarium der Totenmesse ist vollständig, aus dem Proprium fehlen das Graduale und der Tractus „Absolve Domine“. Dafür ist aber die sich üblicherweise dem Tractus anschließende Sequenz „Dies Irae“ Bestandteil der Komposition. Diese Sequenz ist seit dem Zweiten Vatikanischen Konzil nur noch in der außerordentlichen Form des römischen Ritus Bestandteil des Requiems., I.

Es hat sein Vorbild in einem Anthem von Georg Friedrich Händel (dem Chor \\"The ways of Zion do mourn\\" aus dem \\"Funeral Anthem for Queen Caroline\\", HWV 264) und wirkt vor allem durch eine ansteigende Tonfolge in Vierteln einprägsam. In mehreren Sätzen des Werks finden sich Anklänge daran, unter anderem in den Koloraturen der \\"Kyrie\\"-Fuge und im Ausklang des \\"Lacrimosa\\". Dieses Netz motivischer Beziehungen hat große Bedeutung für das Werk., Die Posaunen kündigen dann das Einsetzen des Chores an, der das Thema zunächst in der Bassstimme und dann imitierend in den anderen Stimmen aufnimmt. Die Streicher spielen dazu um eine Sechzehntel verschobene, synkopische Begleitfiguren, die durch ihr „Nachklappen“ den feierlichen, gemessenen Charakter der Musik unterstreichen.

(Preußen), Geboren 1776, Gestorben 1810, Herzog zu Mecklenburg, Hohenzoller (Linie Brandenburg-Preußen), Kurfürstin (Brandenburg), Königin (Königreich Preußen)], Luise Herzogin zu Mecklenburg[-Strelitz], bekannt als Königin Luise, vollständiger Name: \\"Luise Auguste Wilhelmine Amalie Herzogin zu Mecklenburg\\" (*10.März1776 in Hannover; † 19. Juli 1810 auf Schloss Hohenzieritz), war die Gemahlin König Friedrich WilhelmsIII. von Preußen., Zeitgenossen beschrieben sie als schön und anmutig, ihre ungezwungenen Umgangsformen erschienen ihnen eher bürgerlich als aristokratisch. Ihr Leben war eng verknüpft mit den dramatischen Ereignissen im Kampf Preußens gegen Napoleon Bonaparte. Da sie früh starb, blieb sie auch in der Vorstellung der nachfolgenden Generationen jung und schön. Schon zu Lebzeiten wurde sie zum Gegenstand beinahe kultischer Verehrung. Nach ihrem Tod setzte sich diese Tendenz verstärkt fort. Sie wurde als Mutter Kaiser Wilhelms I. zum Symbol für den Wiederaufstieg Preußens und für die Entwicklung hin zum Deutschen Kaiserreich. So liegt ihre historische Bedeutung in der legendären Berühmtheit, die sie als Königin von Preußen tatsächlich hatte., Leben., Elternhaus und Kindheit., Luises Familienhintergrund war das Ergebnis von Zweckverbindungen des Hochadels über die Grenzen der deutschen Kleinstaaten hinweg. Ihr Vater Herzog Karl zu Mecklenburg[-Strelitz] war ein nachgeborener Prinz aus dem Hause der Herzöge von Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Nach Studium in Genf und einigen Reisen hatte er die repräsentative und gut bezahlte Aufgabe übernommen, das Kurfürstentum Hannover als Gouverneur für seinen Schwager, den britischen König GeorgIII., zu verwalten. Dieser war zwar in Großbritannien geboren, stammte aber aus dem Haus Hannover und ließ sein deutsches Stammland von London aus regieren., 1768 heiratete Karl in Hannover die 16-jährige Prinzessin Friederike von Hessen-Darmstadt. Fünf ihrer zehn Kinder starben früh, sie selbst überlebte die letzte Niederkunft nur um zwei Tage. Als sie im Alter von 29 Jahren starb, war ihre Tochter Luise, Prinzessin von Mecklenburg-Strelitz, erst sechs Jahre alt. Der Witwer heiratete die jüngere Schwester der Verstorbenen – Luise erhielt also ihre Tante zur Stiefmutter –, die aber nach nur 15 Monaten ebenfalls im Kindbett starb, nachdem sie ihren Sohn Karl zur Welt gebracht hatte., Wenig später wurden die sechs Kinder getrennt. Die beiden Söhne, Georg und Karl, blieben bei ihrem Vater in Hannover. Charlotte, die älteste der vier Töchter, war seit 1785 mit dem Regenten des kleinen Herzogtums Sachsen-Hildburghausen verheiratet. Die Schwestern Therese, Luise und Friederike wurden 1786 ihrer Großmutter in Darmstadt zur weiteren Erziehung anvertraut. Diese Großmutter war die Witwe des Bruders des regierenden Landgrafen von Hessen-Darmstadt und wurde nach dem Vornamen ihres verstorbenen Gatten volkstümlich „Prinzessin George“ genannt. Sie war eine resolute, kluge alte Dame, die ihren drei Enkelinnen im Alten Palais der kleinen Residenzstadt Darmstadt manche Freiheiten ließ., Luise, als Kind mit Beinamen wie „Jungfer Husch“ und „unsre tolle Luise“ bedacht, war noch als Jugendliche kindlich unbefangen und verspielt. Der Stadtpfarrer von Darmstadt gab den drei Schwestern Konfirmandenunterricht. Für die unumgängliche Ausbildung in der französischen Sprache und in höfischer Etikette sorgte Mademoiselle Salomé de Gélieu, die zuvor im damals preußischen Neuchâtel ein Mädchenpensionat geleitet und in England als Erzieherin in aristokratischen Familien gearbeitet hatte. Zusätzlich erhielten die Prinzessinnen Unterricht in Englisch, Geschichte und Deutsch sowie im Zeichnen und Malen und im Klavierspiel., Luise war keine eifrige Schülerin. Ihre französisch geschriebenen Briefe blieben lebenslang fehlerhaft und erst viel später, in Berlin, ging sie daran, einige der größten Bildungslücken zu schließen. Dort ließ sie sich über Geschichte und Philosophie informieren und bat Freundinnen wie Marie von Kleist und Karoline von Berg, sie bei der Auswahl ihrer Lektüre zu unterstützen. Frau von Berg (1760–1826), ihre Hofdame, Mentorin und Vertraute, führte einen literarischen Salon in ihrer Villa am Berliner Tiergarten und korrespondierte mit Berühmtheiten wie Goethe, Herder, Jean Paul und dem Reichsfreiherrn vom und zum Stein. Von ihr erhielt Luise Hinweise zur zeitgenössischen Literatur, von ihr erbat sie Texte „von denen Sie annehmen, daß sie mir gefallen und mir am meisten nützen“. In einem Brief an Marie von Kleist, die Cousine des Dichters Heinrich von Kleist, werden ihre literarischen Neigungen deutlich: „Möge Gott mich davor bewahren, meinen Geist zu pflegen und mein Herz zu vernachlässigen“; sie würde eher „alle Bücher in die Havel werfen“, als den Verstand über das Gefühl zu stellen., Das Leben der Prinzessinnen in Darmstadt wurde unterbrochen durch häufige Besuche bei den zahlreichen Verwandten aus hessischen und mecklenburgischen Adelshäusern, durch Reisen nach Straßburg und in die Niederlande. Oft hielt man sich in Frankfurt am Main auf, wo die ältere Schwester Therese seit 1787 mit dem damals noch nicht ganz standesgemäßen, aber sehr reichen späteren Fürsten Karl Alexander von Thurn und Taxis verheiratet war. Mehrmals machten die 14-jährige Luise und ihre jüngere Schwester Friederike Besuche im Hause der Frau Rat Catharina Elisabeth Goethe, der Mutter des berühmten Dichters; Jahre später schrieb diese ihrem Sohn darüber nach Weimar: „Das Zusammentreffen mit der Prinzessin von Mecklenburg hat mich außerordentlich gefreut … von einer steifen Hofetikette waren sie da in voller Freyheit – tantzend – sangen und sprangen den gantzen Tag …“ In Frankfurt war man auch 1792 anlässlich der Krönungsfeierlichkeiten für FranzII., den letzten Kaiser des Heiligen Römischen Reiches, der 1804 als FranzI. erster Kaiser Österreichs wurde. Den Festball in der Botschaft Österreichs eröffnete Luise gemeinsam mit dem jungen Reichsgrafen Klemens von Metternich, dem später berühmten Diplomaten und Staatsmann., Anfang März 1793 wurden die beiden Schwestern, jetzt 17 und 15 Jahre alt, in Frankfurt dem preußischen König Friedrich WilhelmII. vorgestellt, der brieflich über diese Begegnung berichtete: „Wie ich die beiden Engel zum ersten Mal sah, es war am Eingang der Komödie, so war ich so frappirt von ihrer Schönheit, daß ich ganz außer mir war, als die Großmutter sie mir präsentirte. Ich wünschte sehr, daß meine Söhne sie sehen möchten und sich in sie verlieben […] Ich machte mein möglichstes, daß sie sich öfter sahen und sich recht kennen lernten. […] Sie gaben sich das Jawort und die Versprechung wird bald vor sich gehen, vermuthlich in Mannheim. Der älteste heirathet die älteste und der jüngste die jüngste.“ Zum ersten Mal traf Luise den „ältesten“, den 22-jährigen Kronprinzen Friedrich Wilhelm am 14. März 1793, am 19. März machte er seinen persönlichen Heiratsantrag und am 24. April fand in Darmstadt die offizielle Verlobung statt. Im Ehevertrag wurde festgehalten, dass Luise eine bestimmte Summe „zu selbsteigener Disposition“ erhalten sollte, die sich bei der Geburt eines Sohnes deutlich erhöhen würde; für eine Tochter war nichts dergleichen vorgesehen. Inzwischen war auch Prinz Louis, der „jüngste“, mit Luises Schwester Friederike verlobt, widerwillig allerdings und nur aus Gründen der Staatsräson – er war schon anderweitig, aber unter seinem Stand verliebt. Die Doppelhochzeit wurde für die Weihnachtstage 1793 vereinbart., Die Kronprinzessin., Am 22. Dezember trafen die Schwestern in der festlich geschmückten Stadt Berlin ein. Ein kleines, weißgekleidetes Mädchen begrüßte die Prinzessinnen mit einem Gedicht, Luise hob das Kind hoch, küsste es – und reagierte erkennbar verständnislos, als man ihr sagte, dass ein solches Verhalten ihrer hohen Stellung nicht angemessen sei. Dieser Vorfall, vielfach weitererzählt, gab den ersten Anstoß zur außerordentlichen Beliebtheit Luises bei der Berliner Bevölkerung. Am 24.Dezember 1793 wurde sie mit dem Kronprinzen nach altem Hofzeremoniell im Weißen Saal des Berliner Schlosses getraut. Nach Berichten von Augenzeugen wirkte der Bräutigam, sonst eher schüchtern und introvertiert, an diesem Tag heiter und ausgelassen. Zwei Tage später heirateten Friederike und Prinz Louis., Die Paare bezogen zwei benachbarte Gebäude an der Straße Unter den Linden, das Kronprinzenpalais und das später so genannte Prinzessinnenpalais. Hier entstand 1795 die berühmte „Prinzessinnengruppe“ des Bildhauers Gottfried Schadow, von König Friedrich WilhelmII. in Auftrag gegeben. Der Künstler hatte vorübergehend einen Arbeitsraum im Kronprinzenpalais, sah die Schwestern häufig und durfte sogar „nach der Natur“ ihre Maße nehmen. Luises Mann, der Kronprinz, war allerdings mit der natürlichen, trotz reichlichen Faltenwurfs recht körperbetonten Darstellung unzufrieden. Zudem wurde die inzwischen verwitwete Friederike noch im Trauerjahr schwanger, wurde deswegen „in höchster Eile“ verheiratet und musste den Hof und Berlin verlassen. Als Luise Königin geworden war, verschwand die Skulptur daher für Jahrzehnte aus der Öffentlichkeit. Sie ist heute auf der Museumsinsel in Berlin zu sehen., Das Leben am preußischen Hof verlangte von Luise ein hohes Maß an Anpassung an unbekannte Personen, Regeln und Pflichten. Ihr ungezwungenes Naturell stand dabei manches Mal im Wege. Als Oberhofmeisterin wurde ihr eine erfahrene Hofdame zur Seite gestellt, die Gräfin Sophie Marie von Voß. Sie war 64 Jahre alt, als Luise in Berlin eintraf, und stand seit Jahrzehnten im Dienste des Königshauses. Nach anfänglichen Konflikten zwischen ihrer strengen Berufsauffassung und Luises Neigung zu unkonventionellem Verhalten war sie der Kronprinzessin und späteren Königin eine unentbehrliche Lehrmeisterin in höfischer Etikette und blieb ihr bis zuletzt eine vertraute Ratgeberin und Freundin. Zu einer weiteren Vertrauten wurde ihre Erste Hofdame, die unverheiratete Henriette von Viereck (1766–1854), die als junge Frau einst zu den Favoritinnen Friedrich Wilhelms II. gezählt hatte und 1834 zur Gräfin erhoben werden sollte., Hilfreich für Luises Eingewöhnung in die neue Situation war, dass Friedrich Wilhelm im privaten Bereich jede Art von hergebrachter Förmlichkeit ablehnte. Das Paar pflegte einfache, in diesen Kreisen ungewöhnliche Umgangsformen.

Ludwigsburg, Erbaut in den 1990er Jahren, Kultur (Memmingen), Orgel in Deutschland, Orgelbau Goll, Orgellandschaft Oberschwaben, Paul Ott Werkstatt für Orgelbau], Die Orgel von St. Martin befindet sich in der Stadtpfarrkirche St. Martin im oberschwäbischen Memmingen. Diese ist in ihrer heutigen Form eine um 1325 begonnene und um 1500 vollendete dreischiffige Basilika und die Hauptkirche des evangelisch-lutherischen Kirchenbezirkes Memmingen. Seit über 500Jahren gibt es eine Orgel in der Martinskirche., Das heutige Instrument wurde 1998 von Orgelbau Goll gebaut und in Anlehnung an Orgeln der französischen Romantik disponiert. Es wird sowohl im Gottesdienst, als auch bei Konzerten und Meisterkursen gespielt, des Weiteren dient sie häufig zur Einspielung von Tonträgern., Baugeschichte., Spätgotische Orgel., Die erste Orgel in St. Martin wurde erstmals 1453 erwähnt, um 1400 angeschafft und frühestens 1420, nach Vollendung des Hauptschiffes, auf einer Schwalbennestempore auf der südlichen Hochschiffwand aufgebaut. Der Zugang erfolgte über ein Treppentürmchen am vorderen südlichen Vorzeichen. Die Blasebälge befanden sich vermutlich über dem Seitenschiff in einer Kammer. Die Orgel wurde wahrscheinlich als Blockwerk und mit getrennt spielbarem Prinzipal gebaut. Bei den nachfolgenden Bauarbeiten in St. Martin musste sie nicht verändert werden. Der Chronist Jakob Friederich Unold berichtet, dass die Orgel erstmals 1478 im Gottesdienst gespielt wurde., Erster Kantor war vermutlich Friedrich Rebmann aus Mainz. 1500 stellte die Stadt bis auf Widerruf den Organisten Albrecht Fischer ein, der für die Orgeln in St. Martin und in der zweiten Stadtpfarrkirche, Unser Frauen, zuständig war. Er wurde jeweils zum Quatember mit zwölf Pfund und zehn Schillingen besoldet, musste aber die Kalkanten selbst bezahlen. 1528 wurde die Orgel im Zuge der Reformation in Memmingen, die in dieser Zeit an Ulrich Zwingli und dessen reformatorischem Bildersturm orientiert war, entfernt. Die evangelischen Geistlichen von St. Martin wollten den Gottesdienst aber wieder mit Orgelmusik gestalten, weshalb 1568 man sich mit einem Positiv behalf. Dessen damaliger Standort ist nicht bekannt., Neubau durch Andreas Schneider 1598/1599., Seit dem Bildersturm in der Reformationszeit existierte in der Reichsstadt Memmingen keine repräsentative Orgel mehr. Nachdem sich die Pfarrer der beiden Stadtpfarrkirchen seit 1550 immer wieder vergeblich für die Anschaffung eines neuen, großen Instruments eingesetzt hatten, lenkte der Rat 1597, unter dessen Herrschaft die Kirchen seit der Reformation standen, ein. Er beauftragte Andreas Schneider aus der Niederlausitz, der in Ulm als Orgelbauer tätig war, mit dem Bau einer neuen Orgel. Schneider, der mit seinen Gesellen während der Bauzeit 1598/1599 in der Stadt wohnte, erhielt für seine Arbeit 5.000 Gulden. Die Orgel wurde auf dem Schwalbennest ihrer Vorgängerin aufgestellt. Das Gehäuse war reich vergoldet und mit Schnitzwerk und vielen Engelsköpfen verziert. Auf dem Mittelturm trug das Gehäuse eine Statue des Königs David, die heute auf der Brüstung der Goll-Orgel steht. Auf den Deckeln des Orgelgehäuses befanden sich Bildnisse der Bürgermeister Hartlieb, Keller und Funk, des Pfarrhofpflegers und mehrerer anderer Personen. Die Bemalungen waren vermutlich an den Brüstungsfeldern des Rückpositivs befestigt. Die Flügeltüren trugen alttestamentliche Bildnisse., Nach der Fertigstellung bezeichnete der fuggersche Hoforganist Hans Leo Haßler am 21. November 1599 die Orgel „als gelungen“. Zwei Jahre später wurden allerdings Fehler festgestellt, die von Schneider behoben werden konnten. 1681 reparierte Johannes Riegg die Orgel. In einer Prospektpfeife war folgende Inschrift zu lesen: „Johannes Riegg, Orgelmacher und Organist daselbst, das Orgelwerk zu Memmingen renov. den 1. Heumonat 1681“. Riegg nahm vermutlich keine Änderungen am Klang vor und reparierte lediglich die Technik, wobei er das Instrument allerdings mehr demolierte als reparierte. Die damalige Disposition ist nicht erhalten. Im Vergleich mit anderen Werken Rieggs, vor allem dem im Ulmer Münster und den späteren Überarbeitungen war sie vermutlich wie folgt aufgebaut:, 1656 baute Stadtbaumeister Knoll zwischen dem Triumphbogen am Choreingang und dem ersten Pfeilerpaar eine brücken- beziehungsweise lettnerartige Empore ein, vermutlich als Ort für Sänger und Instrumentalisten, die allein oder zusammen mit der Orgel musizierten, da das Schwalbennest nicht den Platz für eine größere Anzahl von Personen bot. Auch für die Aufführungspraxis der zu dieser Zeit beliebten mehrchörigen Musik lag es nahe, Musiker auf mehrere Emporen zu verteilen. Auf dieser Empore stand bis 1827 auch eine kleine Orgel, die später in die Kinderlehrkirche gebracht und dort bis 1874 verwendet wurde. Sie war wahrscheinlich vom Orgelbaumeister Siegmund Riegg angefertigt worden., Die Disposition war:, Reparatur durch Gabler 1759., Nach Rieggs mangelhafter Instandsetzung wurde 1758 Joseph Gabler beauftragt, eine erneute Reparatur durchzuführen, diese dauerte 15 Monate. Gabler überholte auch die Orgeln in der Lateinschule und im \\"Collegium musicum\\". Alle drei Instandsetzungen waren insgesamt mit 400 Gulden veranschlagt worden, am Ende kosteten sie 1.500 Gulden, von denen die Stadt 1.080 bezahlte. Zwei Monate später zahlte der Rat auf Bitten Gablers weitere 30 Gulden. Bei der Instandsetzung wurde die Disposition modernisiert, indem Gabler seine typischen Klangelemente einfügte. Im Stadtarchiv ist dazu zu lesen: „Er hat die Orgel wohl repariert und in vollkommenen Stand gestellt, daß man darob ein seltsames Vergnügen gefunden.“ Johann Nepomuk Holzhey überholte die Orgel zuletzt 1778 für 433 Gulden. Nachdem Memmingen 1802 die Reichsfreiheit verloren hatte und 1803 dem Kurfürstentum Bayern einverleibt worden war, gelangte auch St. Martin kirchenrechtlich zum Kurfürstentum., 1807 untersuchten der Organist Johann Konrad Ellmer, der Orgelbauer Georg Rabus und der Musikdirektor der Stadt, Georg von Unold, die große Orgel und kamen zu dem Ergebnis, dass sie reparaturbedürftig war. Für eine notdürftige Reparatur errechneten sie einen Betrag von 18, für eine umfangreiche Instandsetzung 140 Gulden, was jedoch beides aus Kostengründen abgelehnt wurde. Nachdem das Schwalbennest immer baufälliger geworden war, entschloss sich die Kirchengemeinde 1827, es aufzugeben. Es wurde im selben Jahr zurückgebaut und die Orgel durch Meinrad Dreher aus Illereichen an die Westwand des Hauptschiffes versetzt. Dreher reparierte dabei das komplette Instrument, fügte die beiden neuen Rohrwerke Bombard 16′ und Clairon 4′ hinzu und entfernte die beiden Tremulanten, das Sperrventil und die von Gabler eingebaute Manualkoppel. Die Blasebälge wurden geflickt und ungünstig unter dem Dach des Seitenschiffs aufgestellt. Die Kosten für Versetzung und Reparatur betrugen 1.200 Gulden. Am 26. Januar 1828 wurde die Orgel erstmals wieder bespielt, hatte an ihrem neuen Standort aber nicht mehr den Klang wie im Schwalbennest. Das Gehäuse musste neu gebaut werden. Teile des alten Prospekts wurden in eine barocke Kassettendecke im Schloss Illerfeld in Volkratshofen eingebaut. Nach der Überarbeitung hatte die Orgel folgende Disposition:, Umbau durch Samuel Friedrich Schäfer 1845., 1845 wurde die Orgel an der Westwand durch Samuel Friedrich Schäfer aus Wolfschlugen umgebaut. Zwischen dem 15. April und dem 25. Mai 1845 diente ein Positiv zum kirchlichen Gebrauch. Der neugotische Prospekt der umgebauten Orgel, die im Sommer 1847 fertiggestellt wurde, bestand aus zwei Gehäuseteilen mit je drei spitzbogigen Pfeifenfeldern, die seitlich von der Fensterwand von innen nach außen abfallend gruppiert waren. Das Instrument war allerdings unbrauchbar, da Schäfer die wiederverwendeten alten Register und die neu entwickelten Kegelladen nicht fachgerecht zusammengebaut hatte. Der Umbau kostete 4.800 Gulden für die Orgel und 400 Gulden für die Blasebalgkammer., Die Disposition war wie folgt gegliedert:, Neubau durch Walcker und Spaich 1853., 1853 wurde eine neue Orgel angeschafft. Das neugotische Gehäuse und die Orgel wurden von der Orgelbauwerkstatt aus Ludwigsburg gebaut, die schon kurz vorher eine neue Orgel für die Frauenkirche angefertigt hatte. Bei der Orgelprobe am 11. Juli 1853 bezeichnete der Augsburger Kapellmeister Karl Ludwig Drobisch das Instrument als „vollkommen gelungen und meisterhaft“. Die Empore musste für die neue Orgel, die 5.700 Gulden kostete, vergrößert werden. Das alte Werk nahm Walcker in Zahlung. Mit der neuen Orgel kam die Orgelmusik in der Kirche wieder in das Blickfeld der Öffentlichkeit. Das Instrument wurde 1900 von Steinmeyer repariert und ein neues Gebläse eingebaut., Die Orgel hatte folgende Disposition:, Erweiterung durch Ott 1938., Die 1924 geplante Erweiterung der Walckerorgel wurde 1938 von Paul Ott aus Göttingen umgesetzt. Hauptwerk, Schwellwerk und Pedal hatten Kegelladen, das neue Rückpositiv hatte Schleifladen. Die Steuerung erfolgte durch eine elektrische Traktur. Der Prospekt musste durch die Erweiterung verändert werden. Die neugotischen Aufbauten wurden zugunsten eines Freipfeifenprospekts aufgegeben. Auf einer Einbauempore befanden sich links und rechts je drei Pfeifenfelder, die von außen nach innen abfielen. Die Mitte wurde freigehalten, sodass die doppelten Emporenfenster sichtbar waren. Hinter den Manualwerken standen die Pedalpfeifen nach C- und Cis-Lade geteilt, der Größe nach von innen nach außen absteigend. Unter der Empore war das Rückpositiv, das drei Pfeifengruppen in Form eines W beinhaltete, mittig in die Brüstung eingelassen., Die Disposition war nach dem Umbau wie folgt gegliedert:, Neubau durch Walcker 1962., Nachdem sich die Kirchengemeinde ein größeres Instrument wünschte, begann man Anfang der 1960erJahre mit Planungen für eine neue Orgel. 1962 beauftragte die Gemeinde die Firma Walcker aus Ludwigsburg eine neue Orgel an dem bisherigen Standort an der Westwand zu errichten. Die dahinterliegenden großen Fenster wurden dafür zugemauert. Die alte Orgel einschließlich Prospekt wurde entfernt und zerstört. Der neue Prospekt gliederte sich in 14 rechteckige Pfeifenfelder, die in Kästen eingeschlossen waren, und drei Lamellenfelder für den Schwellkasten. Der Prospektentwurf stammte von dem Architekten Wolfgang Gsaenger. Die Mitte war dreigeschossig, unten das Schwellwerk, darüber das dreiachsige Hauptwerk mit niedriger Mitte, ganz oben ein fünfachsiges Oberwerk. Die Klanggestalt folgte zeittypisch neobarocken Vorbildern (Abkehr von der Grundtönigkeit der Romantik, große Vielfalt an Teilton- und Mixturregistern), wobei z: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"E.F.
