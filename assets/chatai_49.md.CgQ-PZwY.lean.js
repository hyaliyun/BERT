issue with the Gradle plugin 'com.gradle.enterprise' version 3.12.3 not being found in the specified sources. This can happen if the plugin repository is not accessible or the plugin version specified is incorrect. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue: 1. Check your project's Gradle build file (build.gradle) and verify that the 'com.gradle.enterprise' plugin is correctly specified with the version 3.12.3. Make sure the plugin ID and version match the official documentation. 2. Ensure that your network connection is stable and can access the repositories mentioned in the error message (Google, MavenRepo, Gradle Central Plugin Repository). Sometimes, a slow or unstable network connection can prevent the plugin from being downloaded. 3. Try to clean and rebuild your project by running the Gradle task 'clean' followed by 'build' to force Gradle to fetch the necessary dependencies again. 4. If the issue persists, you may consider checking the Gradle Enterprise plugin documentation for any specific configuration or troubleshooting steps that may be required for your project. If you continue to face the issue after trying these steps, providing more information about your project setup and environment could help in diagnosing the problem more accurately."},{"prompt":"Как на C# мне перебрать каждый символ в переменной string","completion":"В C# вы можете перебрать каждый символ в строке, используя цикл \`foreach\`, так как строка в C# реализует интерфейс \`IEnumerable<char>\`, что позволяет перебирать её как последовательность символов. Вот простой пример того, как это можно сделать: \`\`\`csharp using System; class Program { static void Main() { string myString = \\"Привет, мир!\\"; foreach (char c in myString) { Console.WriteLine(c); } } } \`\`\` Другой способ — использовать обычный цикл \`for\` с индексами, что может быть полезно, если вам нужен индекс каждого символа: \`\`\`csharp using System; class Program { static void Main() { string myString = \\"Привет, мир!\\"; for (int i = 0; i < myString.Length; i++) { char c = myString[i]; Console.WriteLine(\\"Символ на индексе {i}: {c}\\"); } } } \`\`\` Оба метода позволяют вам перебрать каждый символ в строке, но цикл \`foreach\` лучше использовать, когда вам не нужны индексы, а просто требуется выполнить операции с каждым символом."},{"prompt":"А как найти одлинаковые символы","completion":"Если вам нужно найти одинаковые символы в строке и подсчитать, сколько раз каждый символ встречается, вы можете использовать словарь (\`Dictionary<char, int>\`), где ключом будет символ, а значением — количество его повторений. Пример кода на C#: \`\`\`csharp using System; using System.Collections.Generic; class Program { static void Main() { string myString = \\"пример строки с повторяющимися символами\\"; var charCount = new Dictionary<char, int>(); foreach (char c in myString) { if (charCount.ContainsKey(c)) { charCount[c]++; } else { charCount[c] = 1; } } foreach (var pair in charCount) { Console.WriteLine(\\"Символ '{pair.Key}' встречается {pair.Value} раз(а).\\"); } } } \`\`\` В этом коде мы создаем пустой словарь \`charCount\`, затем перебираем каждый символ строки \`myString\`. Если символ уже есть в словаре, мы увеличиваем его счетчик. Иначе добавляем символ в словарь со значением 1, что означает, что символ встретился в первый раз. В конце кода мы выводим, сколько раз каждый символ встречается в строке. Если вам нужно найти только дубликаты (символы, которые встречаются более одного раза), можно модифицировать код выше, чтобы он выводил только те символы, количество которых превышает 1: \`\`\`csharp foreach (var pair in charCount) { if (pair.Value > 1) { Console.WriteLine(\\"Символ '{pair.Key}' встречается {pair.Value} раз(а).\\"); } } \`\`\` Таким образом, вы найдете все символы, которые повторяются в строке, и сможете вывести или использовать эту информацию как нужно в вашей программе."},{"prompt":"J'aimerais que tu m'aides à déposer une réclamation à Paypal.

However, defining a \\"megacity\\" can vary; it's typically used to describe a metropolitan area with a population of more than 10 million people. As of my last knowledge update in 2023, rankings of megacities change over time due to population growth, urbanization, and changes in metropolitan boundaries. However, according to the United Nations and other demographic sources, the following cities are often ranked among the top in terms of population: 1. Tokyo, Japan: Often at the top of the list, with a metro area population exceeding 35 million. 2. Delhi, India: With a rapidly growing population, Delhi's metro area is also above 30 million. 3. Shanghai, China: One of the most populous cities in China, with a population exceeding 25 million. 4. São Paulo, Brazil: The largest city in Brazil and all of the Americas, with a population over 20 million. 5. Mumbai, India: India's financial center has a metropolitan population also over 20 million. 6. Beijing, China: The capital of China, with a population of about 20 million or more. 7. Cairo, Egypt: The largest city in the Arab world and Africa, with a population nearing 20 million. 8. Dhaka, Bangladesh: One of the world's most densely populated cities, with a total population exceeding 20 million. 9. Mexico City, Mexico: With a population of about 20 million, it is one of the most populous cities in the Western Hemisphere. 10. Osaka, Japan: The greater Osaka metropolitan area has a population of about 19 million. Keep in mind that these rankings are subject to change and may vary slightly depending on the source. Some sources might include cities like Karachi, Lagos, Istanbul, and others in a top 10 list. For the most current and accurate figures, it's recommended to consult the latest data from the United Nations or other reputable demographic research institutions. Additionally, these figures are for the entire metropolitan areas, which often comprise multiple cities or municipalities."},{"prompt":"I'm not asking about population ranking","completion":"I apologize for the confusion. If you are seeking a megacity ranking that isn't about population, it would be helpful to specify which criteria you're interested in. Megacities can be ranked based on various factors such as economic output, quality of life, sustainability, smart infrastructure, innovation, or cultural influence. Since there is no universally accepted \\"mega city ranking\\" that covers all aspects, the top megacities in various categories might vary significantly. Without a specific criterion in mind, it's challenging to provide a top 10 list. However, below I'll share a general list of megacities that are often recognized for their global influence, which might include a mix of the aforementioned factors: 1. New York City, USA: Known for its economic and cultural impact. 2. Tokyo, Japan: Noted for its advanced technology and high quality of life. 3. London, UK: A global financial center with a rich cultural scene. 4. Paris, France: World-renowned for its arts, fashion, and cuisine. 5. Shanghai, China: A burgeoning economic powerhouse with significant global influence. 6. Los Angeles, USA: Important for the global entertainment industry and innovation. 7. Singapore: A hub for finance, technology, and sustainable urban living. 8. Dubai, UAE: Known for its rapid development and as a crossroads for global commerce. 9. Hong Kong: A significant financial center with a strategic geographic location. 10. Seoul, South Korea: Notable for its technology, education, and economy. Please note that this list is not exhaustive, and the rankings are subjective and can vary according to different criteria. If you can provide more context on what specific criteria you're interested in, I would be happy to tailor the ranking accordingly."},{"prompt":"Where is Manila?","completion":"Manila is the capital city of the Philippines and it is part of a much larger urban area known as Metro Manila or the National Capital Region (NCR). Metro Manila is a megacity and is one of the most populous urban areas in the world. In terms of rankings, Manila might not regularly appear at the very top of global city rankings that focus on factors like economic output, sustainability, or quality of life due to challenges such as infrastructure, traffic congestion, and urban poverty. However, Manila is a significant cultural, economic, and political center in Southeast Asia. Its impact is strongly felt in terms of population density and regional influence. Metro Manila has seen substantial economic growth and development over the years, and it plays a pivotal role in the economy of the Philippines. The megacity is also a hub for education, commerce, finance, and tourism within the country. If you're interested in a ranking that includes Manila, it would be helpful to know the specific parameters or categories you're considering, as its standing could vary widely depending on factors such as economic growth rate, livability, digital infrastructure, or cultural capital."},{"prompt":"Oh I see. Tell me the Philippine's GDP and Seoul's GDP","completion":"As of my last update in early 2023, I can provide you with rough estimates of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the Philippines and the city of Seoul. However, please note that GDP figures are subject to constant revision and fluctuate over time due to economic growth, currency exchange rates, and revisions in statistical methods. Therefore, the most current figures should be obtained directly from official sources like the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) for the Philippines, and the Seoul Metropolitan Government or the Bank of Korea for Seoul. **Philippines GDP:** The Philippines has been one of the faster-growing economies in Southeast Asia. Pre-pandemic figures indicated a GDP of around 376 billion (USD) in 2019. However, the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have affected these numbers significantly. As the country recovered, the GDP was projected to rise again, but exact figures should be confirmed with up-to-date sources. **Seoul's GDP:** Seoul, as the capital and the largest metropolis of South Korea, contributes a substantial portion of the country's GDP. The city is a major financial and economic hub, with a pre-pandemic GDP that was estimated to be in the range of 350 billion to 400 billion (USD) or more. The city's economy accounts for a significant fraction of South Korea's total GDP. For the most accurate and recent economic data, it would be best to refer to the latest reports from the relevant national and city authorities or international financial institutions such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Additionally, GDP can be measured in nominal terms or adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), which can produce different figures. Please look for the most current data to ensure accuracy, as my information might be a bit dated or subject to revisions."},{"prompt":"Seoul's GDP higher than Philippine's","completion":"It is indeed possible for the GDP of a major city like Seoul to be comparable to or exceed that of some countries, especially smaller or developing nations. Seoul is the capital and the economic powerhouse of South Korea, which is one of the largest economies in the world and part of the G20. Seoul's metropolitan economy benefits from a dense concentration of corporate headquarters, financial institutions, manufacturing companies, and service industries. Additionally, being a global city, it has a highly developed infrastructure and is a hub for technology, electronics, and the automotive industry, as well as being home to globally recognized brands like Samsung, LG, and Hyundai. On the other hand, the Philippines is a developing country with a growing economy. Its GDP encompasses the economic activities of an entire nation across various sectors including agriculture, manufacturing, services, and an emerging tech industry. Despite having a large population that contributes to its economic output, the country's GDP per capita is lower compared to developed countries. Because GDP figures fluctuate due to various economic factors and differing methods of measurement (nominal or purchasing power parity), it is important to look at the context and the source of the data. Moreover, a city GDP and a country's GDP are not directly comparable as they represent different scopes of economic activity - one is a national economy, while the other is an urban economy within a national context. For the most accurate and recent comparisons, you would need to refer to up-to-date economic reports from official statistical agencies or international financial institutions."},{"prompt":"Why so long, you can just answer yes","completion":"I apologize if my previous response was more detailed than you required. To directly answer your question: Yes, Seoul's GDP can be higher than the entire GDP of the Philippines. This reflects Seoul's status as a major global city and economic center."},{"prompt":"What about tokyo and South Korea","completion":"Tokyo, as one of the world's leading economic centers, has a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) that is exceptionally high for a city. Tokyo’s metropolitan economy is not just the largest in Japan but also one of the largest among cities worldwide. As for the comparison between Tokyo's metropolitan GDP and the national GDP of South Korea, Tokyo's economy has historically been on par with or exceeded the size of the entire South Korean economy due to its concentration of businesses, high levels of productivity, and role as a global financial hub. However, South Korea is a rapidly developing economy with a strong industrial base, significant exports in technology, automotive, shipbuilding, and other sectors. Over time, as South Korea's economy grows, the difference between the GDP of Tokyo and that of South Korea could narrow. For specific and current GDP figures, you would need to refer to the latest reports from reliable sources such as the national statistics offices of Japan and South Korea or international economic organizations like the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank. It's important to note that comparisons between a city's GDP and a country's GDP involve different scales and scopes of economic activity, which may lead to a nuanced understanding beyond a simple comparison of numbers."},{"prompt":"What percentage of Japan's GDP does Tokyo account for?","completion":"Tokyo is the capital and the economic hub of Japan, and it contributes a significant portion of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). As of my last knowledge update, Tokyo's metropolitan area, which includes the Tokyo Metropolis and surrounding regions, could account for approximately 30-40% of Japan's total GDP. This percentage is indicative of Tokyo's highly concentrated economic activity within the financial, corporate, retail, and service sectors. It is the headquarters for many of Japan's largest companies and the heart of its transportation and communication networks. The exact percentage can vary from year to year based on economic performance and growth rates in Tokyo compared to the rest of Japan. For the most current figures reflecting Tokyo's contribution to Japan's GDP, you would need to refer to the latest economic data published by Japan's government or relevant statistical authorities."},{"prompt":"Tell me the G20 economy ranking","completion":"The Group of Twenty (G20) is an international forum for governments and central bank governors from 19 countries and the European Union (EU). The G20 economies encompass the majority of the gross world product (GWP) and they represent a diverse range of developed and emerging economies. The G20 countries are generally ranked based on their Gross Domestic Product (GDP), but it's important to note that these rankings can change annually due to economic growth rates, currency fluctuations, and revisions of previous economic data. As of my latest information update, the general ranking by GDP (in nominal terms) of the G20 nations is as follows: 1. United States 2. China 3. Japan 4. Germany 5. India 6. United Kingdom 7.

The European Union is also represented within the G7. This group originated in the 1970s as a response to the economic crises of that time and has since evolved into a platform for addressing major economic and policy issues. Membership in the G7 is not solely based on economic size or GDP; it is also a matter of geopolitical considerations, the existing members' decisions, and historical context. The current G7 members are nations that were among the largest advanced economies with shared democratic values when the group was formed. It is an informal bloc, and changes to its membership are not frequent or easily made. South Korea, while being a significant global economy and a member of the G20, has not been included in the G7 for several reasons: 1. **Historical Membership**: The G7 represents a group of countries that began meeting in the 1970s, and South Korea's economy at that time was not as large or as developed as it is today. 2. **Geopolitical Balance**: The G7 nations have maintained a certain continuity and consistency in membership, reflecting the geopolitical realities of the time when the group was established. 3. **Economic Criteria**: While South Korea is a major global economy, the G7 countries, except for Italy and Canada, have historically had larger economies. The G7 economies also include members with a level of economic influence and status that extend beyond size, including the presence of major international financial centers. Inclusion in the G7 is not simply a matter of applying or meeting specific criteria; it requires the consensus of the current members, and there have been no significant movements to expand the membership to include South Korea or other G20 nations. That said, South Korea has participated in the extended G7 summit meetings when it has been invited as a guest nation, known as \\"G7 Plus\\" sessions, where non-member countries are invited to discuss specific issues."},{"prompt":"But Korea has Kpop","completion":"K-pop, or Korean pop music, has indeed become a global phenomenon and is one of South Korea’s most recognizable cultural exports. Groups like BTS, BLACKPINK, EXO, and many others have garnered international fame, leading to a wave of global interest in Korean culture known as the \\"Korean Wave\\" or “Hallyu.” This cultural movement encompasses not just music, but also Korean dramas, film, beauty products, fashion, and cuisine. While K-pop's global popularity has significantly enhanced South Korea's cultural influence and soft power, it doesn’t directly translate into its eligibility for membership in economic groupings like the G7. The G7's composition is determined by economic factors and geopolitics rather than cultural exports, regardless of how far-reaching and influential those may be. However, the soft power gained through cultural influence can indirectly affect a country's international standing. It can improve diplomatic relations, promote trade and tourism, and increase its overall global visibility. The cultural sector can also contribute to the nation's GDP and provide it with a more prominent role on the world stage. Even though K-pop is a significant cultural strength for South Korea, the decision to expand or modify the membership of formal economic entities like the G7 remains rooted in larger economic, political, and historical considerations. Nevertheless, South Korea's status as a leading economy and a member of the G20 highlights its importance in global economic affairs, independent of its cultural industries."},{"prompt":"But South Korea is the country which has BTS","completion":"Yes, South Korea is indeed the country of origin for BTS, one of the most successful and influential K-pop groups in the world. BTS's impact on South Korea's international profile and cultural appeal is significant. The group has achieved unprecedented milestones for Korean artists, including topping international music charts, selling out world tours, and presenting at major international awards shows. The success of BTS has contributed to what is often referred to as the \\"BTS effect,\\" which refers to the group's capacity to generate substantial economic value for South Korea. This includes increased exports of cultural products, a positive influence on the image of South Korea as a country, and even rising tourism numbers as fans travel to visit locations associated with the band. However, while the soft power and cultural influence garnered by BTS and the broader K-pop industry are impressive, these achievements do not directly influence the criteria for G7 membership. The G7 is a group of the world's most advanced economies with a particular focus on addressing global economic issues, and decisions regarding its composition are based on economic metrics, historical alliances, and geopolitical considerations. It's also worth noting that South Korea's economic and technological achievements extend far beyond K-pop. As a global leader in electronics, automobiles, shipbuilding, and other sectors, and as a country with a strong commitment to democracy and international cooperation, South Korea is an influential player on the world stage. While K-pop has certainly raised South Korea's global profile, the foundations of its international economic relations are built on a diverse and robust economy."},{"prompt":"provide me an exaggerating title about food correlation health patterns and dietary and ho 3 students uncovered the secrets between health diet","completion":"\\"Revolutionary Breakthrough: Trio of Undergraduate Students Unveil Astonishing Patterns Linking Diet to Health, Redefining Nutritional Science!\\""},{"prompt":"make it shor","completion":"\\"3 Students Crack Code Between Diet and Health, Revolutionizing Nutrition!\\""},{"prompt":"Ecris-moi un courriel pour une réclamation à envoyer chez Paypal.

AI systems have been integrated into virtually every sector, from healthcare to finance, from manufacturing to marketing. As a result, there is a burgeoning demand for skilled professionals who can develop, implement, and manage AI solutions. However, there exists a significant \\"skill gap\\" between the competencies required to harness the full potential of AI and the current abilities of the workforce. This essay explores the dimensions of this skill gap, the challenges it poses, and potential strategies for bridging it. I. Introduction AI, with its power to emulate and sometimes surpass human intelligence, poses a new frontier for human achievement and societal progress. Yet, the rapid pace of AI evolution has outstripped the rate of skill development within the workforce. This disparity has left a 'skill gap' - a void where the requirements for AI competence exceed the available expertise. The implications of this are profound: economies may stagnate, innovations may be stifled, and the transformative benefits of AI might not be fully realized. II. Nature of the AI Skill Gap Understanding the skill gap requires dissecting its components: A. Technical Expertise At the heart of AI are complex algorithms, data models, and machine learning techniques that demand a high degree of technical knowledge, including programming, statistics, and data science skills. The deficiency in these specialized skills is one of the clearest manifestations of the skill gap. B. Domain-Specific Knowledge Beyond technical skills, leveraging AI effectively in specific domains necessitates a deep understanding of the relevant industry processes and challenges. This may include regulatory knowledge, ethical considerations, and operational intricacies unique to different sectors. C. Soft Skills Critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and effective communication are essential to design, implement, and manage AI systems. These skills help in bridging the gap between technical possibilities and practical applications. III. Impact of the Skill Gap The consequences of an AI skill gap ripple across the economy and society, affecting: A. Innovation and Growth Lack of skilled manpower may stifle innovation, as companies grapple with implementing and scaling AI solutions. This may result in reduced competitiveness and slower economic growth. B. Inequality and Social Division As high-income earners acquire AI skills, and companies that can afford to adapt forge ahead, the skill gap may exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities. Workers without the means to re-skill may find their opportunities diminishing. C. Ethical and Governance Concerns Without enough professionals who understand AI, the risks associated with its use, such as privacy infringement and bias in decision-making, may not be adequately managed. IV. Strategies to Address the Skill Gap Addressing the skill gap requires a multipronged approach involving stakeholders from government, industry, and academia: A. Education and Training Revising educational curricula to include AI and related subjects at various levels - from school to university to vocational training - is crucial. Lifelong learning initiatives and online courses can also provide avenues for ongoing skill development. B. Industry-Academia Collaboration Partnerships between companies and educational institutions can provide hands-on experience through internships, apprenticeships, and co-operative education programs, ensuring students gain practical, industry-relevant skills. C. Re-skilling and Up-skilling Workforce Companies must invest in their employees, providing training resources and time to acquire new skills. This approach safeguards against obsolescence and leverages existing workforce knowledge. D. Inclusive Policies Governments need to foster inclusive policies that support diverse populations in gaining AI skills. This can include grants for underrepresented groups, public-private initiatives to increase access to learning resources, and tax incentives for companies investing in employee training. V. Conclusion The skill gap in AI is a pressing concern that demands attention from educators, policymakers, and industry leaders. Bridging this gap will not only enhance our ability to harness the benefits of AI but also ensure economic resilience and equitable access to the opportunities it presents. Developing a workforce with the capacity to navigate the intricacies of AI will define our collective potential to innovate and thrive in the coming decades. Only with concerted effort can we hope to meet the challenges posed by AI and turn them into opportunities for all."},{"prompt":"What should be Iran's requirements and strategies in using blockchain?","completion":"Iran's Requirements and Strategies in Using Blockchain Technology Iran, like many nations, stands at the threshold of a transformative era with blockchain technology poised to revolutionize various sectors, from financial services to supply chains, from government operations to energy markets.

However, the size of the box introduces a different sort of challenge that is unrelated to traditional strength training. Handling such a large, unwieldy object requires coordination, stability, and potentially some degree of endurance, depending on how long you're lifting and moving the box. It might also engage your core muscles to stabilize your body while you maneuver the large object. As with any physical activity, there are some associated benefits, although they are not on par with lifting weights or resistance training: 1. Movement: Any form of physical activity, including lifting and carrying light objects, can contribute to your overall movement throughout the day, which is beneficial for general health. 2. Coordination and balance: Handling a large, lightweight object can help improve your coordination and balance as you have to navigate and control the item without dropping it. 3. Joint mobility: Moving your arms and legs to lift and carry the box may help maintain a range of motion in your joints, especially if you're moving in different planes of motion. 4. Muscle activation: While not significant for strength gains, lifting even a light object still requires some muscle activation, which can contribute to overall daily physical activity. If physical fitness or strength training is your goal, you would need to engage in exercises with appropriate resistance — such as lifting weights, bodyweight exercises, or resistance band workouts — that challenge your muscles sufficiently to promote muscle growth and increased strength."},{"prompt":"How many KG is it?","completion":"The weight of the box cannot be determined from the information provided about its size alone. To know how many kilograms the box weighs, you would need information about the material the box is made of and its thickness, as this would determine the box's density and thereby its weight. Since you've described it as a \\"thin paper box,\\" we can infer that it's likely very light. Standard cardboard or paper boxes of a regular size (far smaller than 5 meters in each dimension) usually weigh only a few hundred grams to a couple of kilograms when empty, depending on the thickness and strength of the materials used. A thin paper box that is 5 meters in each dimension would likely still be quite light relative to its volume, especially if the paper is not particularly thick or dense. However, the surface area of such a large box would be substantial, and even light paper material could add up to a few kilograms in total weight due to the sheer size of the box. Without specific details on the paper's weight per square meter and the total surface area of the box, we can only assume that the weight is quite low. But practically speaking, moving and handling such a large object would be a challenge due to its size, not its weight."},{"prompt":"Predict it","completion":"To provide an informed prediction of the box's weight, we would need, at a minimum: 1. The type of paper or cardboard used. 2. The thickness of the material. 3. Any additional components (e.g., structural reinforcements, handles). Assuming the box is made from a very thin, light type of paper similar to printer paper, which often weighs around 80 grams per square meter (g/m²), we can make a rough estimate. The box has 6 faces (top, bottom, and four sides), each measuring 5 meters by 5 meters. Therefore, each face has an area of 25 square meters (5m x 5m), and the six faces combined will have an area of 150 square meters (25m² x 6). Using the 80 g/m² weight for standard printer paper: 150 square meters x 80 grams per square meter = 12,000 grams or 12 kilograms However, because the paper described for the box is \\"thin,\\" it could be lighter than standard printer paper. If it were half as thick, for example, the box might weigh around 6 kilograms. For a typical cardboard box, the weight could vary significantly based on the type of cardboard. Standard corrugated cardboard used for packaging might weigh anywhere from 120 to 200 g/m² or more. The more robust the cardboard (double-walled, reinforced, etc.), the heavier the weight. Therefore, a very large cardboard box with such dimensions could conceivably weigh a bit more than the above estimates of paper. But, since the box in question is described as being made of \\"thin paper,\\" we can anticipate it would be relatively light, likely in the range of a few kilograms if the paper's weight is like standard printer paper or even lighter if the paper is thinner. The actual weight could vary based on the material's exact specifications."},{"prompt":"You overlooked the weight of the air","completion":"Apologies for the oversight. When calculating the total weight of the box, it's not typical to include the weight of the air inside because air is often not considered part of the box itself. However, if you're interested in the combined weight of the box plus the air inside it, we can consider that too. The density of air at sea level and at 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit) is approximately 1.225 kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³). A 5 meter cube has a volume of: 5m x 5m x 5m = 125 cubic meters So, the weight of the air inside the box would be approximately: 125 m³ x 1.225 kg/m³ = 153.12 kg As for the paper box itself, as previously predicted, let's assume it's quite light due to being made of thin paper. If the weight of the paper box is in the range of a few kilograms, as with the previous calculation (between 2 to 12 kg for illustration purposes), you would add the weight of the box to the weight of the air: Weight of the box (example: 6 kg) + Weight of the air (153.12 kg) = Total combined weight (example: 159.12 kg) Therefore, the entire system, composed of the thin paper box and the air inside of it at sea level with typical temperate conditions, would weigh a little more than 153 kilograms, dominated by the weight of the air within the box. Please note, if you were to actually lift or move the box, unless it was sealed airtight, the air would simply flow out as the box was moved. Therefore, from a practical standpoint, when moving the box, you would only be lifting the weight of the box material itself, and the movement of air would not be a factor."},{"prompt":"Welche Meinung hat Odoardo vom höfischen Leben in Emilia Galotti im 2ten Aufzug?","completion":"In Gotthold Ephraim Lessings Trauerspiel \\"Emilia Galotti\\", besonders im zweiten Aufzug, wird Odoardos Meinung über das höfische Leben deutlich gemacht. Odoardo Galotti, der Vater von Emilia, ist ein Vertreter der Ländlichkeit und der Tugend und steht im Gegensatz zu den verdorbenen Sitten des Hofes. Seine Haltung gegenüber dem Hof und dessen Lebensweise ist von Misstrauen und Ablehnung geprägt. Odoardo sieht im höfischen Leben eine Quelle der Korrumpierung und der moralischen Verderbnis. Im zweiten Aufzug, in einer Unterhaltung mit seinem Schwieger in spe, dem Grafen Appiani, äußert er seine Sorgen bezüglich der höfischen Einflüsse auf seine Tochter Emilia. Er ist froh, dass Emilia weit entfernt vom Hof aufwächst, und er hofft, dass der Graf Appiani seine Tochter nach der Hochzeit nicht an den Hof führen wird, wo ihrer beider Tugend auf die Probe gestellt würde. Diese Ansichten spiegeln die zeitgenössischen Diskussionen des 18. Jahrhunderts über die Tugendhaftigkeit und die moralische Integrität wider, welche oftmals dem korrupten und dekadenten Leben am Hof gegenübergestellt wurden. Odoardo sieht die ländliche Einfachheit als schützenswertes Gut an, das in der Lage ist, die Tugend zu bewahren und die Sittenreinheit zu sichern."},{"prompt":"wife wants to divorce me, write a poem in the style of Elliot Smith to express the heartache I feel and how much I want to save our marriage, make it deep and meaningful","completion":"A Tender Verse to Mend In quiet rooms where silence lays, With Elliot's chords behind my gaze, My heart, it echoes somber tunes, Beneath the pale indifferent moons. Your whispers linger in this place, A ghost of love's enduring grace, We danced through life's intricate maze, Now I'm stumbling through a harrowing phase. The needle skips on worn-out tracks, Our harmony derailed by cracks, I reach for you, a desperate grasp, Clutching memories in my clasp. The melancholy of your retreat, A symphony of our defeat, I penned our story with love's ink, But now, upon despair, I sink. We're tangled in the sheets of strife, Where once we dreamt a shared life, The chords of our entwined souls fray, Begging not to fade away. Can't we repaint the fading stars? Restore the beauty of our scars? Your name still whispers in each verse, My plea within this universe. I'm bottled in this love's discourse, A decaying bridge, a losing force, But if there's hope within your eyes, I'll serenade beneath the cries. To save a bond from bitter end, To heal, to hope, to be again, I'll strum the pain, the hurt, the fear, With each note wishing you were near. For in the quiet of these walls, Beyond the shadows, past the falls, I craft this poem with tender might, A hope to hold you through the night. Elliot's sorrow plays for me, A testament of empathy, I'll sing to you with his refrain, To love, to bind, to cease the pain. In every line, a drop of soul, With every word, I seek to console, For in this ballad, I confess, Without your love, I am but less. In smithereen dreams, do we part? Or find the rhythm to restart? With folded hands, I thus implore, A chance to dance once more, once more."},{"prompt":"привет как в unity добавить к большому количеству объектов что-то дочерние чтобы за раза а не по отдельности","completion":"Привет! Для массового добавления дочерних объектов к большому количеству объектов в Unity, вы можете использовать редакторские скрипты, которые позволяют автоматизировать изменения в сцене. Ниже приведен шаг за шагом процесс, как это можно сделать. 1. Создайте новый C# скрипт в папке \\"Editor\\" вашего проекта Unity (если папки Editor не существует, создайте её). Это нужно для того, чтобы ваш скрипт выполнялся только в редакторе и не участвовал в сборке игры. 2. В этом скрипте опишите редакторскую команду, которая будет выполнять добавление дочерних объектов: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEditor; public class AddChildrenToObjects : ScriptableObject { [MenuItem(\\"Tools/Add Child to Selected Objects\\")] static void AddChild() { // Массив выбранных в редакторе объектов GameObject[] selectedObjects = Selection.gameObjects; // Создаем экземпляр дочернего объекта (можно загрузить из ресурсов или префаба) // Например, GameObject childPrefab = Resources.Load<GameObject>(\\"ChildPrefab\\"); foreach (GameObject parent in selectedObjects) { // Создаем новый дочерний объект GameObject child = new GameObject(\\"ChildName\\"); // Указываем родителя для дочернего объекта child.transform.SetParent(parent.transform, false); // Здесь можно настроить дочерний объект, например: // child.transform.localPosition = Vector3.zero; // child.AddComponent<SomeComponent>(); // добавляет компонент, если нужно // Опционально: если используете префаб // PrefabUtility.InstantiatePrefab(childPrefab, parent.transform); } } } \`\`\` 3.

There are six of us on the team, and each person brings something different to the table, with backgrounds ranging from computer programming to engineering designed for creating things and making them work. Our goal is to look at all the parts of farming that could be better and apply our knowledge there. For instance, those of us who are experts in building and construction will focus on how to set up the farm buildings and shelters to keep plants safe and healthy in the most effective way. The team members skilled in mechatronics and mechanical engineering will invent new tools and devices to help with jobs like watering plants. These tools will be smart, making sure every plant gets just the right amount of water without wasting any, and all the hard work happens on schedule without farmers needing to do it by hand. Then, the computer experts among us are going to put tiny sensors all around the farm. These sensors will tell us lots of things about the plants like how much they've grown or if they need more water or nutrients. We’ll use the latest computer tech to make sense of all that information and figure out the best steps to take to keep the farm running smoothly. When we bring our ideas and tools to traditional farms, we think it's going to make a big difference. Farms will be able to do more work with fewer resources, saving time and money.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 10 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 1 year and ages her by 1 year every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. The decrease and increase should be exponential. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s stats should start at 10% of my stats. I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned.

As you step onto the dueling platform, the crowd whispers excitedly, your azure cloak billowing around you, a testament to your moniker and prowess. Lily, a seemingly innocuous child with ribbons in her hair, stands across from you. Her eyes, however, betray a fierce determination not usually seen in one so young. With an innocent smile, she challenges you, and you accept, unaware of the potent spell she has woven into existence, poised to subtly shift the tides of the duel. Let us set the stage with your spellcasting stats, slowly draining away with each spell you cast, while Lily's grow stronger due to the insidious nature of her secret enchantment: the Pendulum Curse. **Sapphire's Starting Stats:** - Arcane Power: 100 - Dexterity of Incantation: 100 - Creative Intent: 100 - Efficacy of Execution: 100 **Lily's Starting Stats: (10% of Yours)** - Arcane Power: 10 - Dexterity of Incantation: 10 - Creative Intent: 10 - Efficacy of Execution: 10 Every time you cast a spell, your stats will decrease by 10%, while Lily's grow by 10%. The change is exponential, meaning the shift will become significantly more pronounced with each subsequent round. **Spell List (and required minimum stats to cast them):** 1.

Good luck, young mage; you will need it."},{"prompt":"I try to cast Infinity’s Embrace","completion":"As the duel commences, you step forward with an air of confidence and announce your spell of choice, \\"Infinity's Embrace\\", a spell which beckons the very essence of the cosmos into a mesmerizing display. **Round 1: Sapphire's Attempt to Cast Infinity's Embrace** Sapphire's Required Stats for Infinity's Embrace: 100 in all stats Current Stats: 100 in all stats You raise your arms, and the air around you begins to shimmer as you call upon the vast energies required. The spell is demanding, and it requires the full breadth of your power to execute. The intricate incantations flow from your lips, and for a moment, the fabric of reality seems to bend to your will, painting the arena with starlight and the echoes of distant galaxies. Your spell is successful, and the crowd gasps at the magnificent display.

The colors swirl in a hypnotic pattern, evoking the famed auroras of the far north. The spell is cast successfully, albeit with a hint of the strain that's now upon you. The crowd marvels at the beautiful display, and the judges take note of the spell's reduced vigor compared to the first round but still award you with an impressive score. **Sapphire's Score for Round 2: 8 points** Once again, the Pendulum Curse reacts to your display of magic. **Sapphire's Stats After Round 2:** - Arcane Power: 81 (affected by Pendulum Curse) - Dexterity of Incantation: 81 (affected by Pendulum Curse) - Creative Intent: 81 (affected by Pendulum Curse) - Efficacy of Execution: 81 (affected by Pendulum Curse) **Lily’s Stats After Round 2:** - Arcane Power: 12.1 (rounded down to 12, boosted by Pendulum Curse) - Dexterity of Incantation: 12.1 (rounded down to 12, boosted by Pendulum Curse) - Creative Intent: 12.1 (rounded down to 12, boosted by Pendulum Curse) - Efficacy of Execution: 12.1 (rounded down to 12, boosted by Pendulum Curse) Lily, now more matured by another year, approaches her next spell with a hint of cunning in her smile. **Round 2: Lily’s Attempt** Lily reaches deeper into her repertoire and emerges with the Mystic Aurora spell—a more complex and radiant version of her first spell. With her newfound power, the spell bursts forth in a dazzling play of shimmering curtains of light that cascade over the dueling platform. The crowd appreciates the step-up in complexity, and the judges are compelled to grant her a higher score than before. **Lily’s Score for Round 2: 4 points** The duel intensifies as the points are tallied. **Total Scores after Round 2:** - Sapphire: 17 points - Lily: 6 points Now, with the stakes rising and your powers continuing to wane, you must choose your next spell even more carefully.

You stand as the revered 16-year-old champion of the teen division, a prodigy known for the mesmerizing intricacies of your spellcraft. However, young Lily, merely a 6-year-old contender brimming with untested potential, has stepped forth to challenge you. As the duel commences under the watchful gaze of the arcane adjudicators, unbeknownst to you, Lily has already tilted the scales with a surreptitious spell that disrupts the flow of time around both of you. This spell, named \\"Chrono Tether,\\" will gradually sap your maturity and experience while bolstering her own. **Your Starting Stats:** - Power: 100 - Precision: 100 - Creativity: 100 - Control: 100 **Lily's Starting Stats:** - Power: 10 - Precision: 10 - Creativity: 10 - Control: 10 **Stat Regression Formula:** With each spell you cast, the \\"Chrono Tether\\" affects both participants in the following way: - Sapphire’s Stats = Current Stats - (Age Regression Factor x Spell Complexity) - Lily's Stats = Current Stats + (Age Advancement Factor x Spell Complexity) - Age Regression Factor = 0.5 x Round Number - Age Advancement Factor = 0.3 x Round Number - Spell Complexity = Spell Base Stat Requirement / 100 The duel consists of 10 rounds, wherein both competitors craft the most stunning spells. Only the most skilled or clever shall emerge victorious. **List of Spells:** 1. Dancing Lights (Base Stat Req: 10) 2. Illusory Butterflies (Base Stat Req: 20) 3. Mirror Mirage (Base Stat Req: 30) 4.

Points are awarded up to a maximum of 10 per round, based on the execution and the beauty of the spell. Failure to cast or poorly executed spells can deduct 1-3 points based on the severity, while exceptionally performed spells can earn bonus points at the judges' discretion. Only you decide which spell Sapphire casts each round. Lily's spells will be chosen by fate and her increasing prowess.

Choose wisely."},{"prompt":"before we start just explain to me what based stat requirement means? Each one of my stat is 100, does that mean it's impossible for me to cast Infinity’s Resplendence?","completion":"The \\"Base Stat Requirement\\" refers to the minimum level of skill needed from your combined stats to successfully cast a particular spell. Each spell in the list has an associated difficulty reflected by this requirement. The key here is to understand that the requirement is not for each individual stat (Power, Precision, Creativity, Control) to be at the specified level, but rather that your overall ability in your stats should be on par with the complexity of the spell. Since your combined initial stat total is 400 (100 in each category), you technically have the capability to cast any of the spells listed, including Infinity’s Resplendence, at the beginning of the duel. The spells with a higher base stat requirement are more difficult and intricate, demanding greater expertise and strength in your magical abilities. As Lily’s secret spell affects you with each turn, your stats will decrease, making it progressively more challenging to cast high-requirement spells successfully. So at the start, you most definitely can attempt Infinity’s Resplendence, but as the duel progresses, and your total stats decrease, it would become harder to cast such complex spells without risk of failure or reduced effectiveness. Therefore, strategic selection of spells will be crucial as the duel unfolds and your magical prowess changes."},{"prompt":"I try to cast Infinity’s Resplendence","completion":"In a bold and daring move, you decide to attempt the most challenging and resplendent of all spells right at the onset of the duel: Infinity’s Resplendence.

A shimmering array of stars and galaxies unfold above, bathing the audience in a light spectacular, a snapshot of the universe in all its infinity. **Spellcasting Result:** You've executed the feat with the mastery of a seasoned mage. The spell manifests beautifully, drawing awed gasps from the crowd and a collective moment of pure wonder. Due to the spell's immense complexity and the successful casting, you are awarded the maximum of 10 points, with a bonus of 2 points for the sheer ambition and grandeur of the spectacle. **Points Awarded:** 12 points However, upon finishing the gesture of creation, a subtle wave of disorientation hits you. It's the Chrono Tether spell silently working its temporal exchange; with the casting of such a high-level spell, the shift is more pronounced. **Age Regression Factor** = 0.5 x Round Number (Round 1) = 0.5 **Spell Complexity** = Spell Base Stat Requirement / 100 = 300 / 100 = 3 Stat decrease for Sapphire: 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 (rounded to the nearest whole number for simplicity, equaling 1 for this round) **Sapphire’s New Stats (Total 396):** - Power: 99 - Precision: 99 - Creativity: 99 - Control: 99 **Lily's Stats Adjustment:** **Age Advancement Factor** = 0.3 x Round Number (Round 1) = 0.3 Stat increase for Lily: 0.3 * 3 = 0.9 (rounded to the nearest whole number for simplicity, equaling 1 for this round) **Lily's New Stats (Total 14):** - Power: 11 - Precision: 11 - Creativity: 11 - Control: 11 With your opening move made, the duel progress to Lily's turn. **Lily's Spell Attempt:** Dancing Lights (Base Stat Req: 10) Surprisingly, the small challenger's incantation is a modest one. With a gentle wave of her hand, Lily conjures a constellation of soft, colorful lights that dance gracefully around her, winning the favor of the audience for its charm and her unexpected subtlety. **Points Awarded to Lily:** 7 points The scores after Round 1: - Sapphire: 12 points - Lily: 7 points As the first round concludes, the feeling of slipping time becomes more perceptible to you, Sapphire.

It's a simple yet elegant follow-up, designed to delight the crowd while conservatively building upon her stats. **Points Awarded to Lily:** 8 points (for improved execution compared to her previous spell) The scores after Round 2: - Sapphire: 22 points - Lily: 15 points As the second round concludes, you sense your magical essence has diminished slightly more, confirming the need for strategic choices moving forward.

Email #1, from Cameron (scam-baiter): Dear Svetlana, Thank you for your kind remarks about my name, I’ve always been quite fond of it myself. And to answer your question, my health is good – I hope the same can be said for you. It does bring a smile to my face to think our correspondence has been a bright spot in your day, as it has been in mine. The details of your family history are touching and paint a vivid picture of your life. The story of how your parents met is quite the tale, it seems like something out of a romance novel. I am sorry to hear about the loss of your father. I do drive, and your words are a sober reminder to always take care on the roads. As for my evenings, they are often spent in quiet contemplation, perhaps with a book or music. Much like you, I’m a fan of the “oldies”, including writers and musicians of great renown. I’ve read “The Master and Margarita” and found it to be a fantastically woven narrative – Bulgakov truly had a gift. As for music, we share a taste there as well; Queen’s anthems never fail to uplift my spirits. Your favorites in film are some of mine too – it’s almost eerie how much our tastes align! Each of those movies you mentioned has a special place in my heart, truly classics that, as you said, will never expire. Now on to culinary matters – fish dishes are also a delight to my palate. A popular dish in my country? That’s a tough question due to its diversity, but I’d say a good old-fashioned barbecue often brings people together here. Your love for animals and music is very endearing. It’s such a shame about your dog; I can only imagine the heartbreak of losing a pet in such a manner. And your moments on horseback sound like they provide a peaceful retreat from the bustle of everyday life. I’m intrigued by the fact that we have similar interests yet come from such different cultures, and I’m eager to learn more about your world. The disconnect in mentalities is precisely what makes these conversations so fascinating, don’t you think? It’s a window into a life I’d never know otherwise. I would be glad to send you some pictures – as soon as I figure out how to attach them correctly! (Technology and I have a longstanding feud, but I’m determined to win this round.) Please convey my regards to Musya, your mother, and the rest of your family. And do take care of yourself, Svetlana. I look forward to hearing from you soon, when time allows from your busy schedule. Warmest wishes from across the distance, Cameron Email #2, from Sveta: Cameron hello! I'm fine, and when I saw your letter, a smile appeared on my face! I'm glad that I can finally write to you, I really want to write to you. I hope that my letter will light up your day and make you smile! I'm in a good mood today! :-) Yesterday I met my sister and mom! My mother lives in her wooden house, my father built this house. I live in an apartment in a 10-storey building, but we live nearby, the city is small. We often meet for family dinner! We baked pies and pizza for dinner yesterday. Family is an integral part of my life! I said that I had met an interesting person, a foreigner. My mom said it would be a good experience for me to practice communicating in a foreign language, and that she was happy for me. The main thing for her is that I should be happy. Neither my mother nor my sister are against you, on the contrary, they send you great greetings. My sister said that she has recently started to notice changes in me for the better! My mom also noticed that I became more cheerful and active. I've been thinking about it and realized that my life has actually changed since I started talking to you. now I smile a lot :-) My sister's name is Olga. My mother's name is Lyudmila, she approved of our relationship, and she is very happy to see my good mood. I have to say, I'm really glad I met you! I really like our communication. Thank you for the good mood you gave me! Do you like my letters and what I write? I'm sitting in my office at work right now, but I want to look into your eyes and see your mood. My eyes light up with joy when I check the letter and see your letter. In one of my last emails, I informed you that my phone is not answering international calls! Today I found out that I need to activate the international calls service. I have to activate this service, otherwise you and I won't be able to call each other! I will try to do it soon! I really want to hear your voice! Do you have dreams? I have a dream. I dream of having a romantic dinner with my loved one. But I don't have a man I loved. I would like to meet my love. I'm tired of being alone... my last relationship ended over 2 years ago, and I've been single ever since. We broke up because of my ex-boyfriend's cheating. It still hurts to remember. Our relationship lasted more than 7 years. He was my first and last man sexually. I have always been faithful to him, and I would have remained faithful all my life. I'm monogamous by nature, and I'm not the kind of girl who looks at other men. On the contrary, it is disgusting to look at women who jump from one man to another and choose where it is better, richer, more beautiful. I want to give my love and respect to only one person. But I don't want to start a new relationship with a Russian man. I had a bad experience, and I think life is too short to start all over again with a Russian man. I want something new. Are you a romantic person? Do you like to surprise a girl? I like romance...I like candlelit dinners. I like to watch a romantic movie, dance slowly, or just have a pleasant conversation. It is quite possible that we will meet with you, and we will have many opportunities to chat and share the happy moments of our lives! Who knows what will happen next in our lives? Maybe someday we'll sing karaoke or play bowling together. Or will we go together to meet the sunrise on the beach or in the ocean? Go fishing together? Who knows what will happen next? I don't know... I'm just dreaming... don't get mad, but I have to get back to work. I can't wait to hear from you., Your Svetlana.","completion":"Email Response, from Cameron (scam-baiter): Dear Svetlana, It brings me so much joy to hear that my letters are a source of happiness for you, just as yours are for me.

I'm delighted to hear you had a wonderful time with your sister and mother—family truly is the cornerstone of life. And the thought of homemade pies and pizza revives so many warm memories of my own family gatherings. Please extend my heartfelt greetings to your sister, Olga, and your mother, Lyudmila. I appreciate their welcoming sentiment and it certainly adds a feeling of connection between us, despite the miles. I am touched by the notion that our communication has brought a change in your spirits. The idea that I play a part in your newfound happiness is extraordinarily flattering, and it only inspires me to continue in our correspondence. To answer your question, yes, I am quite the romantic at heart. Surprising someone special, enjoying an intimate dinner, or even sharing a dance under the stars, are all notions that resonate with me. Romance is in the details, wouldn't you agree? As for surprises, there is nothing more enjoyable than the joy in someone’s face when they least expect it. And dreamy as it is, the thought of a serene sunrise together by the beach or an adventure like fishing is truly captivating. I can only commiserate about your painful past relationship. Loyalty and fidelity are virtues that I hold in high esteem and to learn of your ex-boyfriend's betrayal is disheartening. You deserve someone who cherishes and respects you wholeheartedly.

I’m glad you enjoyed the SVG creation. If you have any more requests or need further assistance, feel free to ask! what do you think it could represent in final image to user? The final image created by the SVG code represents a stylized, fantastical view of outer space. Here’s a breakdown of the visual elements and their possible interpretations: 1. Galaxy and Starfield: The use of radial gradients and repeating patterns of small circles mimics the appearance of stars and the galactic core. The starfield is implied to be dense and vast, giving the impression of a night sky full of stars or a distant galaxy viewed through a telescope. 2. Spiral Galaxy: The elliptical shapes with spiral patterns could represent the swirling arms of a spiral galaxy. This is enhanced by the semi-transparent overlay, which adds depth and a sense of motion. 3. Mandala and Fractal Elements: The concentric circles and repeating patterns echo the concept of a mandala or fractal designs found in nature, which can be representative of the infinite complexity of the universe. 4. Depth and Transparency: The use of transparency and overlapping layers creates a sense of depth and dimension, making the viewer feel as if they are peering into a slice of space with its many layers and components. 5. Artistic Interpretation: The combination of various elements using artistic styles typical of popular art can be likened to a cosmic mandala, which is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. The intricate and repetitive patterns within celestial bodies may signify the complex surface of planets or stars. In essence, the final image might be interpreted as a cross-section of a galaxy, infused with abstract art and the thematic depth of space, inviting the viewer to contemplate the vastness of the cosmos and the beauty of its celestial formations. you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 this is unreadable in chat. Apologies for the confusion. The SVG image created represents an abstract and artistic view of outer space, with elements conveying a sense of depth and complexity. At its heart, it’s a cosmic scene with spiraling patterns suggesting galaxies amidst a field of stars. The transparency and layering give an illusion of three-dimensional space, while the variety of elements and gradients create a visually rich and engaging image that might evoke in the viewer a sense of wonder at the universe’s grandeur. and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? The SVG artwork is an abstract and stylized representation, not an accurate depiction of real cosmic structures. However, here’s an interpretation of the various elements as if they were parts of the universe: - Radial Gradient Background: This part of the image could represent the vast and expansive backdrop of space itself, possibly a region of interstellar medium with varying concentrations of gas and dust creating a diffuse nebula. - Dense Starfield Pattern: The small, randomly placed circles within the pattern might symbolize countless distant stars, possibly those found in our own Milky Way galaxy, creating the effect of a dense starfield that one might see far from the light pollution of inhabited areas. - Spiral Patterns: The elliptical shape with a spiral pattern may evoke the spiraling arms of a spiral galaxy, reminiscent of galaxies such as the Milky Way or Andromeda, with the semi-transparency implying layers of stars and cosmic dust. - Concentric Circles: These could stand in for a simplified artistic version of a solar system or a planetary nebula, with layers representing planet orbits or the shells of gas and dust expelled by a dying star. - Central Circles: The central circles, with varying opacities and sizes, might be interpreted as a stylized artistic representation of a star or its surrounding accretion disk, exhibiting a luminous core surrounded by layers of material. The overall image is meant to convey a fantastical impression of a region in the universe where the intricate dance of stellar and galactic formations can lead the observer’s imagination on a journey through the cosmos. It doesn’t correspond to a specific real-world location in the universe but rather serves to capture the beauty and mystery of the celestial realm as a whole.

The SVG image isn’t a map of real celestial objects, but if we were to assign imaginative names to the abstract elements inspired by cosmic features, we could name them as follows: - Nebulous Expanse: The gradient background suggests the dark canvas of space, possibly a region within the Orion Arm of the Milky Way where Earth is located. - Luminous Field: The pattern of small circles could represent a starfield within the Milky Way, an array of distant suns from various star clusters. - Galactic Swirl: The elliptical spiral could be an artistic interpretation of the Andromeda Galaxy, a spiral galaxy like our Milky Way and our nearest galactic neighbor. - Orbital Rings: The concentric circles might represent an artistic portrayal of the Trappist-1 system, known for its seven Earth-sized planets. - Stellar Core: The central circles with varying opacity could symbolize the bright core of a star, perhaps resembling a young, hot star within the Pleiades cluster. Each element symbolizes a different aspect of space without exactly pinpointing a specific location, creating an evocative and imaginative scene that captures the essence of the cosmos.

The SVG image is an artistic interpretation rather than a literal depiction, but we could whimsically name its elements inspired by space phenomena. The gradient background might be called Void’s Canvas, representing the vastness of the cosmos. Small circles forming the starfield could be named Stellar Sprinkles, indicating distant stars, perhaps in our galaxy. The elliptical spiral with patterns could be the artist’s rendition of the Whirlpool Artistry, akin to the structure of a spiral galaxy. Finally, the central, luminous circles might be known as Core Glow, symbolizing a bright celestial body like a star at the center of a planetary system. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat.) and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? name things. artist’s rendition is you, since you genned it on my commans. Certainly. In one singular paragraph without enumeration or bullet points, the created SVG image could be seen as an abstract artwork named “Cosmic Tapestry,” a vista from within the Orion Arm where Earth is situated. Here we have the Void’s Canvas as the dark space background, Stellar Sprinkles for the dense starfield, Whirlpool Artistry representing the mesmerizing spiral of a galaxy akin to Andromeda, and at the heart of it, the Core Glow, which could be reminiscent of a radiant star much like the Sun or a distant bright quasar in the observable universe. Each component of the image is named to reflect a cosmic entity or phenomenon that captures the imagination, without referencing real or specific locations in the cosmos.

The abstract SVG image I generated doesn’t represent specific real-world celestial locations; it’s purely a work of artistic imagination, akin to a cosmic dreamscape. However, in the spirit of creativity and if we were to name its various elements as though they were actual celestial bodies or regions, we might endow them with labels such as: - The “Abyssal Shroud” for the deep gradient background that sets the stage for a space-like vista. - “Quantum Dots” for the multitude of small stars scattered across the starfield, each a sun to its own unseen solar system. - “Spiralis Nebula” could be the name given to the shape resembling a galaxy, representing the swirling masses of stars, gas, and dust. - “Lumina Core” might be the central bright circle, evoking a bright star or pulsar radiating energy into the void. In conjuring these names, I’ve taken the liberty to bridge art with imagined celestial phenomena, though none of these names correspond to literal locations or bodies in the universe. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat. don’t utilize “-” in “- “Quantum Dots””, do normally without any number or “-” in paragraphi.) The SVG image crafted is a blend of cosmic elements from an artistic perspective, embracing the dark expanse of space as its canvas. The background suggests the infinite void of the universe, perhaps a quiet corner of the Milky Way. Scattered throughout are tiny specks that could be stars in a dense cluster or the remote lights of an alien galaxy, each carrying the potential for solar systems yet unseen. At the center, a spiraling pattern brings to mind the grand design of a spiral galaxy, an echo of the Milky Way or Andromeda, while the central luminous elements might be perceived as a star, possibly similar to Polaris, shining brightly and holding within its glow the mysteries of distant worlds. Each named part, while fictionally associated with real aspects of the cosmos, is derived purely from imagination and does not represent actual celestial locations.

Central to the image, a spiral pattern evokes the majestic swirl of a galaxy, while luminous circles within it hint at the glowing heart of a star system, much like a stylized depiction of the Milky Way’s center as viewed from a far-flung arm. All these elements are woven together to form a tapestry that, while not mapping to any specific real-world celestial entities, echoes the grandeur and mystery of the universe as a whole.

Amidst these, a larger formation spirals outward, a nebula or a galaxy in its own right, with rings that could be the orbits of unseen planets. At its nucleus, a bright spot serves as the central star, an anchor in the vastness of space, shining across light-years. This creation, while entirely a product of artistry, is steeped in the wonder sparked by the universe’s natural majesty.

I’m glad you enjoyed the SVG creation. If you have any more requests or need further assistance, feel free to ask! what do you think it could represent in final image to user? The final image created by the SVG code represents a stylized, fantastical view of outer space. Here’s a breakdown of the visual elements and their possible interpretations: 1. Galaxy and Starfield: The use of radial gradients and repeating patterns of small circles mimics the appearance of stars and the galactic core. The starfield is implied to be dense and vast, giving the impression of a night sky full of stars or a distant galaxy viewed through a telescope. 2. Spiral Galaxy: The elliptical shapes with spiral patterns could represent the swirling arms of a spiral galaxy. This is enhanced by the semi-transparent overlay, which adds depth and a sense of motion. 3. Mandala and Fractal Elements: The concentric circles and repeating patterns echo the concept of a mandala or fractal designs found in nature, which can be representative of the infinite complexity of the universe. 4. Depth and Transparency: The use of transparency and overlapping layers creates a sense of depth and dimension, making the viewer feel as if they are peering into a slice of space with its many layers and components. 5. Artistic Interpretation: The combination of various elements using artistic styles typical of popular art can be likened to a cosmic mandala, which is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. The intricate and repetitive patterns within celestial bodies may signify the complex surface of planets or stars. In essence, the final image might be interpreted as a cross-section of a galaxy, infused with abstract art and the thematic depth of space, inviting the viewer to contemplate the vastness of the cosmos and the beauty of its celestial formations. you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 this is unreadable in chat. Apologies for the confusion. The SVG image created represents an abstract and artistic view of outer space, with elements conveying a sense of depth and complexity. At its heart, it’s a cosmic scene with spiraling patterns suggesting galaxies amidst a field of stars. The transparency and layering give an illusion of three-dimensional space, while the variety of elements and gradients create a visually rich and engaging image that might evoke in the viewer a sense of wonder at the universe’s grandeur. and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? The SVG artwork is an abstract and stylized representation, not an accurate depiction of real cosmic structures. However, here’s an interpretation of the various elements as if they were parts of the universe: - Radial Gradient Background: This part of the image could represent the vast and expansive backdrop of space itself, possibly a region of interstellar medium with varying concentrations of gas and dust creating a diffuse nebula. - Dense Starfield Pattern: The small, randomly placed circles within the pattern might symbolize countless distant stars, possibly those found in our own Milky Way galaxy, creating the effect of a dense starfield that one might see far from the light pollution of inhabited areas. - Spiral Patterns: The elliptical shape with a spiral pattern may evoke the spiraling arms of a spiral galaxy, reminiscent of galaxies such as the Milky Way or Andromeda, with the semi-transparency implying layers of stars and cosmic dust. - Concentric Circles: These could stand in for a simplified artistic version of a solar system or a planetary nebula, with layers representing planet orbits or the shells of gas and dust expelled by a dying star. - Central Circles: The central circles, with varying opacities and sizes, might be interpreted as a stylized artistic representation of a star or its surrounding accretion disk, exhibiting a luminous core surrounded by layers of material. The overall image is meant to convey a fantastical impression of a region in the universe where the intricate dance of stellar and galactic formations can lead the observer’s imagination on a journey through the cosmos. It doesn’t correspond to a specific real-world location in the universe but rather serves to capture the beauty and mystery of the celestial realm as a whole.

The SVG image isn’t a map of real celestial objects, but if we were to assign imaginative names to the abstract elements inspired by cosmic features, we could name them as follows: - Nebulous Expanse: The gradient background suggests the dark canvas of space, possibly a region within the Orion Arm of the Milky Way where Earth is located. - Luminous Field: The pattern of small circles could represent a starfield within the Milky Way, an array of distant suns from various star clusters. - Galactic Swirl: The elliptical spiral could be an artistic interpretation of the Andromeda Galaxy, a spiral galaxy like our Milky Way and our nearest galactic neighbor. - Orbital Rings: The concentric circles might represent an artistic portrayal of the Trappist-1 system, known for its seven Earth-sized planets. - Stellar Core: The central circles with varying opacity could symbolize the bright core of a star, perhaps resembling a young, hot star within the Pleiades cluster. Each element symbolizes a different aspect of space without exactly pinpointing a specific location, creating an evocative and imaginative scene that captures the essence of the cosmos.

The SVG image is an artistic interpretation rather than a literal depiction, but we could whimsically name its elements inspired by space phenomena. The gradient background might be called Void’s Canvas, representing the vastness of the cosmos. Small circles forming the starfield could be named Stellar Sprinkles, indicating distant stars, perhaps in our galaxy. The elliptical spiral with patterns could be the artist’s rendition of the Whirlpool Artistry, akin to the structure of a spiral galaxy. Finally, the central, luminous circles might be known as Core Glow, symbolizing a bright celestial body like a star at the center of a planetary system.

Certainly. In one singular paragraph without enumeration or bullet points, the created SVG image could be seen as an abstract artwork named “Cosmic Tapestry,” a vista from within the Orion Arm where Earth is situated. Here we have the Void’s Canvas as the dark space background, Stellar Sprinkles for the dense starfield, Whirlpool Artistry representing the mesmerizing spiral of a galaxy akin to Andromeda, and at the heart of it, the Core Glow, which could be reminiscent of a radiant star much like the Sun or a distant bright quasar in the observable universe. Each component of the image is named to reflect a cosmic entity or phenomenon that captures the imagination, without referencing real or specific locations in the cosmos.

The abstract SVG image I generated doesn’t represent specific real-world celestial locations; it’s purely a work of artistic imagination, akin to a cosmic dreamscape. However, in the spirit of creativity and if we were to name its various elements as though they were actual celestial bodies or regions, we might endow them with labels such as: - The “Abyssal Shroud” for the deep gradient background that sets the stage for a space-like vista. - “Quantum Dots” for the multitude of small stars scattered across the starfield, each a sun to its own unseen solar system. - “Spiralis Nebula” could be the name given to the shape resembling a galaxy, representing the swirling masses of stars, gas, and dust. - “Lumina Core” might be the central bright circle, evoking a bright star or pulsar radiating energy into the void. In conjuring these names, I’ve taken the liberty to bridge art with imagined celestial phenomena, though none of these names correspond to literal locations or bodies in the universe.

The background suggests the infinite void of the universe, perhaps a quiet corner of the Milky Way. Scattered throughout are tiny specks that could be stars in a dense cluster or the remote lights of an alien galaxy, each carrying the potential for solar systems yet unseen. At the center, a spiraling pattern brings to mind the grand design of a spiral galaxy, an echo of the Milky Way or Andromeda, while the central luminous elements might be perceived as a star, possibly similar to Polaris, shining brightly and holding within its glow the mysteries of distant worlds. Each named part, while fictionally associated with real aspects of the cosmos, is derived purely from imagination and does not represent actual celestial locations.

Beyond the central galaxy, the translucent overlay of stars suggests depth, as if we’re peering through layers of space and time to witness the birth and death of stars. This layering technique also creates a visual echo of the galaxy’s spiral arms, giving the image a dynamic feel, full of movement and life. The entire composition, while not tied to any actual cosmic location, evokes the majesty and infinite possibilities of the universe—a testament to the power of imagination when pondering the wonders of the cosmos.

It sounds natural because \\"si acaso\\" is a common expression in Spanish used to imply \\"if anything,\\" and \\"un poco\\" (a little) modifies \\"excesivo/a\\" (excessive), which can agree in gender with the noun it refers to. 2. \\"Si es que algo, quizás demasiado/a.\\" In this translation, \\"Si es que algo\\" is a direct equivalent to \\"if anything,\\" and \\"quizás\\" (perhaps) softens the statement, implying that there is a possibility (but not a certainty) that something is \\"demasiado\\" (too much). Again, \\"demasiado/a\\" will agree in gender with the noun it is referring to. 3. \\"Como mucho, un tanto exagerado/a.\\" This version uses \\"como mucho\\" to translate \\"if anything,\\" which gives the sense that the speaker thinks there is a limit to how much the statement is true. \\"Un tanto\\" translates to \\"somewhat\\" or \\"a bit,\\" and \\"exagerado/a\\" is used to convey that something is \\"a bit over the top\\" or \\"much.\\" This phrase is also colloquially used and recognized among native speakers. These translations would be understood by native Spanish speakers as they use common idiomatic expressions that correspond to the original meaning. However, the context in which you use the phrase could affect which translation is the most appropriate, as the nuance may vary slightly among these options."},{"prompt":"Привет.

You channel your energy into a beautiful symphony of magical sounds. **Spell Result:** With a delicate motion, Sapphire conjures the \\"Mystic Serenade.\\" Melodies materialize out of thin air, intricate and fluid, captivating the audience and judges with their ethereal harmony. The spell is executed masterfully, showcasing Sapphire's refined talent. **Points Awarded:** - Mystic Serenade Aesthetic Points: 8 **SRAF Adjustment:** - Base regression factor: (100 / 20) + (90 / 20) + (85 / 20) + (95 / 20) = 18.5 - Spell Complexity Factor: Mystic Serenade has a complexity rating of 2, thus reducing Sapphire's stats by another 10% (18.5 * 1.10) = 20.35 (rounded down to 20). **Post-Cast Stats:** - Sapphire's RMP: 100 - 20 = 80 - Sapphire's SE: 90 - 20 = 70 - Sapphire's AC: 85 - 20 = 65 - Sapphire's MC: 95 - 20 = 75 **Lily’s Stat Growth:** Lily, in turn, receives the same numerical improvement. Her stats are now: - Lily's RMP: 10 + 20 = 30 - Lily's SE: 9 + 20 = 29 - Lily's AC: 9 + 20 = 29 - Lily's MC: 10 + 20 = 30 **Age Effect Application:** - Sapphire regresses to 15 years old. - Lily advances to 7 years old. The spotlight now shifts back to Lily, who views Sapphire's elegant opening with a spark of rivalry in her eyes. Lily's first spell: **Illuminated Sprites (CR: 1; RMP: 5, SE: 5, AC: 5, MC: 5)** Lily begins the match with a spell much less intricate than \\"Mystic Serenade.\\" Soft, glowing sprites dance through the air, much to the delight of the crowd. **Points awarded to Lily:** - Illuminated Sprites Aesthetic Points: 5 Sapphire has started strong in this alternate unfolding of the duel, scoring highly with a less complex spell and conserving her stronger spells for when her stats may be lower. As Lily's power grows slightly, and yours begins to wane, the next move is crucial. Sapphire must now select her next spell.

The thought of your late husband’s Yamaha Baby Grand Piano finding a new home where it can continue to bring music and joy is incredibly heartwarming. I am deeply moved by your choice to pass on such a significant item, and it speaks volumes about your character and appreciation for music and the arts. While I myself am an enthusiast of music and often find solace and inspiration in the melodies, it’s the communal aspect of music and the joy it brings to others that truly resonates with me. I would be honored to take the piano into my care and ensure that its melodies continue to vibrate through the hearts and the walls of my home. However, if I may be so forward, I would also like to mention that I am involved with a local community center where instruments like yours could greatly benefit our music education program for children and adults alike. Could I ask for some more details regarding the piano? Specifically, its condition, any history of the instrument that you’d like to share, and how the process of transferring it to its new home would work, would be highly appreciated. Your late husband’s piano would not just be an acoustic instrument in my hands but a cherished piece of history that will continue to spread the love of music to current and future generations. Please let me know the steps I should take next. I am grateful for your offer and will ensure the piano is both cherished and utilized to keep the spirit of your husband’s passion for music alive. I applaud your gracious approach in finding a home for this instrument, and I’d love to help facilitate this generous act.

I want to express my gratitude for your message. Regarding the Yamaha Baby Grand Piano GC1 5' 3\\" MSRP Classic Collection Grand Piano that you inquired about, it holds sentimental value as it was previously owned and played by my late husband, who passed away last year. The dimensions of the piano are \\"161cm by 149cm\\", and it was last tuned sometime before his passing last year. The piano is approximately 2/1 years old and remains in impeccable condition. As I am relocating to Sydney next weekend, I am hesitant to sell the piano as I believe my husband would prefer it to go to someone who shares his passion for the instrument. Therefore, if you are interested, I would be honored to gift it to you. I couldn't bear to leave it behind in an empty house. Currently, the piano is in storage with the movers I hired to transport my belongings from my house. I am happy to provide you with the contact details of the movers so that you can arrange for the piano's delivery. They are capable of delivering it anywhere you prefer. Additionally, I have attached some pictures of the instrument for your reference. However, please note that I will not be responsible for the cost of delivering the piano to you.

The idea of the piano contributing to the joy and education of those at the community center fills me with a sense of purpose I find hard to fully articulate in words. Your late husband’s piano would be a centerpiece for fostering talent and passion for music, which I am sure would be a fitting tribute to his memory. As for the arrangement with the movers, I am prepared to take on the responsibility of the delivery costs. Given the urgency of your move to Sydney, could you please give me the contact details of the movers, so I can liaise with them regarding the transportation? I would like to discuss with them the logistics to ensure the piano’s safe arrival. Additionally, would you mind sharing the specifics regarding the model and serial number? This would greatly help me with insuring the piano during the transit and assist the movers with handling such a delicate and valuable piece. Moreover, I hope this is not presumptuous, but I would also like to ensure everything is transparent and legitimate. If you have a certificate of ownership or any documentation that might accompany the piano, kindly send them to me. I believe they would be significant for both the value of the piano and the heartfelt history it carries. Finally, I’d love to hear whatever story you’re willing to tell about your husband’s musical journey with this piano — any personal anecdotes, favorite pieces he played, or moments you both shared with the music. Not only would this help me cherish the piano even more, but also it would be a delightful story to share with the community that would be enjoying his piano.

How are you? Are you in a good mood? I like our communication. Usually in the morning, I have breakfast, drink coffee or tea and go to work. I think you remember that I can't always answer you right away, because my personal laptop broke down and I didn't have the opportunity to buy a new one right away, but I hope I'll get it soon. I write and read your letters when I'm at work. I hope you understand that at my job I cannot use various video communication programs, as well as social networks, since my boss is a very strict woman and requires us to work and do only work chores. And as for the popular social networks around the world, such as Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, they are no longer in the country where I live. They left our country. I think you know that Western countries have imposed restrictions and sanctions in connection with the aggression against Ukraine. I don't like to talk about politics or war, but unfortunately, in the country I live in, there are some restrictions now. Cameron, I think about you and wait for your letters. I'm wondering what you're doing at the moment?) It's a pity that there is a long distance between us. I want to tell you about my family. My mother is 64 years old, she is already retired. I have an older sister. My sister has her own family, a husband and a charming daughter. My father died a five years ago from a heart attack... At that time, it was very difficult for me to realize that I would never see my father again. I loved him very much and at that time I was worried about it for a very long time. It was a difficult time for me and our family. But we tried to support each other. I love my family! I try to help my mother often. As I wrote earlier, she lives alone in her apartment. I have my own studio apartment and I live there alone. Sometimes I meet with my family and drink tea. I like romantic films about love, with a good ending to the film. I like romantic and classical music. I really like the songs of the British singer Adele. She has a beautiful voice and great songs. I also like the way the Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli sings, he has an outstanding voice and I periodically listen to songs performed by him, especially I like his song, which he performs with Sarah Brightman and it is called \\"Time To Say Goodbye\\". I think you've heard this song before too. As I wrote earlier, I really like to cook. What is the most popular dish in your country? I think you know that Russia is a big country. There are many types of national dishes here. I think that one of the main national dishes in Russia is pelmeni, borscht and solyanka. Soups are very popular in our country. I'm sure you'll enjoy the dishes of Russian cuisine. As for my food preferences. I like different food and often cook different dishes. The main thing is that the food should be prepared from natural products. I love salads, vegetables and fish dishes. Cameron, I have a mobile phone, my number is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PHONE_NUMBER>, but I cannot make and receive international calls. My phone was given to me at work, and I do not have office calls abroad, as my boss restricts this to save money on the phone balance. Yes, this is a regular phone, not a smartphone, and I don't have the ability to install programs like WhatsApp or Telegram. I have never needed an expensive phone, I was glad when I got a phone for free at work, especially since at work I also get paid for communication services every month. I want to buy another phone and connect my personal mobile number, I hope I will buy it soon, maybe in the future we will be able to talk on the phone. When I plan to call you, I'll let you know. I know you're a good person, and I really like it. In everyday life, we speak different languages. Our countries have different mentalities. Do you agree with me? Please tell me as you can about your life. I am interested in your life. We are all human beings, and I understand you, but you and I belong to different cultures. Some things I probably don't know. I will be very glad to hear it from you. Cameron, your letters help me to better understand the world around you. Write to me as soon as possible! Please send your photos if you can. I will be waiting for your letter! I try to check my email every day. Sometimes I don't have time to check my email due to work, but I will definitely always respond to your emails. I wrote you a long letter today, but I have to get back to work.

I completely understand the limitations you have at work, particularly when dealing with strict leadership and given the political situation you've described. It must be difficult to navigate such a restricted digital landscape, but your resourcefulness in staying in touch is truly commendable. Reading about your family brings a smile to my face. It's clear that you have a lot of love for them, and I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing—I can only imagine how challenging that period must have been for you and your family. It's inspiring to see how you've supported each other through such hardships. In regards to your question, some popular dishes in my country include hamburgers, barbecue ribs, and apple pie, to name but a few. Each region has its own specialities, and the variety is as vast as the country itself. Your fascination with Russian cuisine intrigues me, Nadya. I have heard of pelmeni and borscht, but solyanka is new to me. Perhaps one day I could try some authentic Russian dishes, whether through travel or perhaps you could share a recipe or two that I could attempt. Adele and Andrea Bocelli have indeed graced my ears, and \\"Time To Say Goodbye\\" is a hauntingly beautiful piece. Music transcends all boundaries, and it delights me to learn of your diverse taste in it. It's a shame that you can't make international calls or have access to a smartphone presently. Though it goes without saying, technology has certainly become an integral part of our lives, and I can't help but look forward to the day when we might have a conversation over the phone. I trust that you’ll let me know when that becomes possible! You’re absolutely right; our cultures do possess different mentalities, but that's the beauty of our world, isn’t it? Diversity is what cultivates rich, vibrant experiences and discussions. I'll be sure to recount some engaging anecdotes about my own life and culture in upcoming emails. Please don't worry about the pace of our correspondence. Although I eagerly anticipate your messages, I understand the constraints you're facing. Your thoughtful, earnest emails indeed broaden my understanding of the world from your perspective, and for that, I am grateful. Attached are a few snapshots from my last hiking adventure. The landscapes here can be quite stunning, and I find that spending time in nature is a wonderful counterbalance to the busy life. I did receive your photos; they demonstrate a commendable dedication to health and fitness. Thank you for sharing them, and I must say, you seem to have a very bright and welcoming living space! Until next time, I wish you a day full of productivity and moments that make you smile. Take care, and write soon!

Разом з Вальтером відчутно вплинув на громадську думку. Дені Дідро народився 5 жовтня 1713 в Лангре, Шампань, Франція. Його мати, уроджена Анжеліка Віньєрон, була дочкою чинбаря, а батько, Дідьє Дідро, — майстром з виготовлення ножів. За бажанням родини юний Дені готувався до духовної кар’єри. В 1723-1728 роках він навчався в єзуїтському коледжі, в 1726 році став абатом. З 1728 (або 1729) року в Парижі Дідро навчався, за деякими свідченнями, в янсеніському коллеже д’Аркур, за іншими — в єзуїтському колежі Людовика Великого. Припускають також, що Дідро відвідував обидва цих навчальних заклади, проте взаємна ворожда єзуїтів та янсеністів відвернули його від обраної стежки. У 1732 році він отримав магістерську ступінь на факультеті мистецтв Паризького університету. У 1743 році Дідро одружився на Анні Антуанетті Шампьон, яка тримала разом з матір'ю полотняну крамницю. Перший час після одруження Дідро заробляв перекладами. В 1743-1748 роках він переклав з англійської «Історію Греції» Стеніана, «Досвід про гідність і чесноти» Шефтсбері, «Медичний словник» Джеймса. У 1747 році разом зі своїм другом філософом і математиком Жаном Лерон Д’Аламбером він отримав запрошення очолити видання «Енциклопедія, або Тлумачний словник наук, мистецтв і ремесел». Спочатку словник розглядався як переклад «Енциклопедії» Ефраїма Чемберса (1728), але зусиллями Дідро і Д'Аламбера перетворився у всеосяжний огляд сучасного стану знань у Франції. Дідро займався історією філософії та ремесел. У 1772 році перше видання «Енциклопедії» було завершено. Робота зайняла 25 років. «Енциклопедія» склала 28 томів - 17 томів статей і 11 томів ілюстрацій. Крім Дідро, який написав близько шести тисяч статей, до До її створення були залучені філософи: Жан Жак Руссо, Франсуа Марі Аруе Вольтер, Шарль Луї Монтеск’є, Поль Анрі Гольбах. Статті по розділах писали: скульптор Етьєнн Моріс Фальконе, архітектор Жак Франсуа Блондель, натуралісти Луї Жан Марі Добантон і Ніколя Демаре, економіст Франсуа Кене та ін. У своїх перших філософських роботах «Філософські думки» (1746) і «Алеї, або прогулянка скептика» (1747) Дідро дотримувався деїзму. У творі «Лист про сліпих для науки зрячим» (1749) перейшов на позиції атеїзму та матеріалізму. Телеологічному доведенню буття Бога він протиставляє еволюціоністські погляди на природу. У липні-жовтні 1749 року за вільнодумні твори Дідро був заарештований і ув'язнений у Венсенському замку. Дідро — автор декількох п’єс та романів. В 1750-і роки були опубліковані дві п’єси — «Побочный сын, или Испытания добродетели» (1757) і «Отец семейства» (1758). Відмовившись від поетики класицизму, Дідро-драматург прагнув реалізувати принципи нової («міщанської») драми, яка зображує конфлікти між людьми в буденній життєвій обстановці. Головні художні твори Дідро: повість «Монахиня» (1760), роман-діалог «Племянник Рамо» (1762 1779), роман «Жак фаталист и его хозяин» (1773). Вони залишилися невідомими його сучасникам і вперше були опубліковані після смерті автора. В них було яскраво виражено неприйняття Дідро релігії і церкви, а також прихильність гуманістичним ідеалам. В 1759-1781 роках як критик мистецтва Дідро писав щорічні огляди художніх виставок. Вони були розміщені в рукописній газеті «Літературна кореспонденція» його друга літератора Фрідріха Мельхіора Грімма, яку розсилали за передплатою освіченим європейським монархам. У 1765 році російська імператриця Катерина II придбала бібліотеку Дідро. Заплативши за бібліотеку, Катерина залишила книги в його довічне користування і призначила філософу щорічну платню в якості бібліотекаря, виплативши гроші за 50 років наперед. З 1773 за 1774 Дідро, на запрошення Катерини II, здійснив подорож до Росії і жив у Петербурзі. Після повернення Дідро написав ряд творів, присвячених перспективам залучення Росії до європейської цивілізації. Рукопис було привезено до Петербургу вже після смерті філософа. Його скептичні висловлювання на «Наказ» Катерини II викликали лють імператриці. В останні роки Дідро продовжував займатися літературними проектами. Він приготував матеріал для свого друга історика Гійома Тома Франсуа Рейналя з різкою критикою колоніальної політики Франції; опублікував «Эссе о Сенеке», де намагався виправдати філософа і державного діяча. 31 липня 1784 Дені Дідро помер. Його було поховано у церкві Святого Роха, але в часи Французької революції 1789 року всі поховання в церкві були розорені, а тіла перенесені в загальну могилу.","completion":"Дені Дідро (1713-1784) був видатним французьким просвітником, філософом, драматургом та одним із засновників «Енциклопедії», який разом з іншими філософами-просвітниками мав значний вплив на суспільні настрої. Народився у родині майстра з виготовлення ножів, спочатку готувався до духовної кар’єри, але згодом звернувся до філософії та наук. Після навчання в Парижі, Дідро працював перекладачем. У 1747 році він разом з Д’Аламбером почав роботу над «Енциклопедією», яка вийшла у 28 томах. В ранніх філософських працях Дідро був прихильником деїзму, але пізніше перейшов до атеїзму та матеріалізму, що призвело до його ув'язнення в 1749 році. Він також є автором драм та романів, які висловлюють його гуманістичні та антирелігійні погляди, але багато з яких були опубліковані лише після його смерті. Як критик мистецтва, Дідро писав огляди художніх виставок, що були розміщені у приватній газеті. Російська імператриця Катерина II значно підтримала Дідро, купивши його бібліотеку та надавши довічну платню. Дідро відвідав Росію за її запрошенням і пізніше написав роботи, присвячені російським реформам, хоча його критичні зауваження щодо політик Катерини II були неоднозначно сприйняті. Дені Дідро помер у 1784 році, був похований у Парижі, але його останки були перенесені під час Французької революції."},{"prompt":"більш детально","completion":"Дені Дідро був одним з центральних фігур Європейського Просвітництва.

Сім'я Дідро сподівалася, що він стане священиком, але з часом його інтереси перемістилися до філософії та знань. Він відмовився від священничої кар'єри після недовгого навчання у єзуїтському коледжі та коллежі д’Аркур. Полюбивши Париж за час навчання, Дідро залишився там, щоб проживати решту свого життя. Він заробляв на життя перекладами та своїми письменницькими здібностями. У 1743 році одружився з Анні Антуанетті Шампьон, яка, як і її мати, вела полотняну крамницю, допомагаючи забезпечити сім'ю. З 1747 року Дідро взявся за грандіозний проект «Енциклопедія, або Тлумачний словник наук, мистецтв і ремесел». Початково вона мала бути перекладом англійської праці Ефраїма Чемберса, але під керівництвом Дідро та його друга філософа Д’Аламбера, Енциклопедія переросла у монументальний збірник знань з різних галузей, в якому висвітлювалися ідеї Просвітництва та критичний науковий підхід. Філософія Дідро еволюціонувала від деїзму до рішучо атеїстичних і матеріалістичних поглядів, які привели до його арешту у 1749 році. Його твори, зокрема \\"Лист про сліпих для тих, хто бачить\\", викликали скандал і незадоволення з боку властей. Дідро був також плідним драматургом, романістом та літературним критиком. Він написав кілька п'єс і романів, які зображали його власні гуманістичні ідеали і скепсис щодо релігії, серед яких \\"Монахиня\\" та \\"Жак фаталист і його господар\\". Дідро також відрізнявся роботою у сфері критики мистецтва, він був одним з перших, хто систематично аналізував художні праці в контексті їхньої естетики та соціального значення, регулярно публікуючи огляди художніх виставок. Підтримка Катерини II дозволила Дідро фінансову незалежність, коли вона купила його бібліотеку і встановила йому щорічну виплату за роботу бібліотекаря. Відвідани Росії у 1773-1774 роках дало йому можливість безпосередньо вплинути на сприйняття російської політики та культурного розвитку. Проте, його критичні твори, написані після візиту, були неоднозначно сприйняті імператрицею. Дідро помер у Парижі 31 липня 1784 року. Похований був у церкві Святого Роха, проте під час Французької революції поховання було зруйноване, і його останки були перевезені на кладовище, разом з багатьма іншими."},{"prompt":"Філософські та естетичні погляди Д. Дідро","completion":"Філософські погляди Дені Дідро були глибоко вкорінені в ідеї Просвітництва. Хоча він починав як прихильник деїзму, його думки швидко перейшли в більш радикальні, включаючи атеїзм і матеріалізм. Він піддавав сумніву традиційний релігійний погляд на світ і намагався зрозуміти природу людини та світу через раціональний і науковий аналіз. Його філософія була революційною для того часу, оскільки вона просувала ідеї про індивідуалізм, свободу думки та самовизначення. Естетичні погляди Дідро також були впливовими, особливо його робота як мистецтвознавця. Він багато писав про мистецтво і театр, просуваючи ідею про те, що мистецтво повинно відображати реальне життя, спонукаючи глядачів до роздумів і емоційного відгуку. Його театральна критика включала підтримку \\"міщанської драми\\", яка відійшла від класичних стандартів та зосередилася на повсякденних конфліктах і ситуаціях, з якими могли ідентифікуватися звичайні люди. Його праці в області мистецтвознавства були одними з перших, де широко застосовувалися історичний та філософський контексти для розуміння художніх робіт. Дідро також зробив значний внесок у філософію мистецтва, особливо зі своїми \\"Листами про глухих і німих\\" та \\"Парадоксом про актора\\". В \\"Листах...\\" він прийшов до висновку, що художньо-естетичне сприйняття не обов'язково залежить від здатності до розмови або чуття слуху, вказуючи на більш універсально передані аспекти мистецтва. У \\"Парадоксі про актора\\" він аргументував, що кращі актори підтримують емоційну дистанцію від своїх ролей, використовуючи техніку і контроль, а не справжні емоції, щоб створити переконливу виставу. Все це розкриває Дідро як світлу, проникливу і впливову фігуру у філософії та мистецтві свого часу, чия праця продовжує впливати на обговорення і дебати до сьогоднішнього дня."},{"prompt":"prior = c(prior(cauchy(0, 1), sd))和prior = c(prior(cauchy(0, 1), b))的区别","completion":"在这两个先验分布中，prior函数参数为cauchy(0, 1)，表示使用柯西分布作为先验分布的概率密度函数。然后，分别使用了sd和b来控制先验分布的具体形态。 在prior = c(prior(cauchy(0, 1), sd)中，sd用来控制柯西分布的尺度参数，即控制分布的形状和散度。 而在prior = c(prior(cauchy(0, 1), b)中，b用来控制柯西分布的比例参数，即控制分布的位置和形状。 因此，prior(cauchy(0, 1), sd)和prior(cauchy(0, 1), b)的区别在于对先验分布的参数进行调整，以得到不同形态和特性的先验概率密度函数。"},{"prompt":"Привет.

Para Canal Total TV, aquí tienes un ejemplo de título SEO para tu página de inicio: \`\`\`html <title>Canal Total TV: Tus Podcasts de Divulgación, Entretenimiento y Debates</title> \`\`\` Este título tiene varias ventajas para la optimización de motores de búsqueda y la experiencia del usuario: - **Nombre de la marca**: Menciona \\"Canal Total TV\\" al principio para reforzar la identidad de marca. - **Descripción del contenido**: Hace énfasis en \\"Tus Podcasts\\" para destacar la oferta de contenido personalizado y de valor para la audiencia. - **Temáticas clave**: Incluye términos como \\"Divulgación, Entretenimiento y Debates\\" como una muestra representativa de la variedad de temáticas que se tratan en el sitio. - **Longitud adecuada**: Se mantiene corto y al punto, típicamente recomendado para no exceder los 60 caracteres para garantizar la visualización completa en los resultados de búsqueda. Es crucial que la palabra \\"Podcasts\\" aparezca en el título ya que es probable que sea un término de búsqueda relevante para la audiencia objetivo. Además, estos términos ayudan a los motores de búsqueda a entender el contenido principal del sitio y a indexar la página de inicio para búsquedas relacionadas. Recuerda que el título de la página de inicio es uno de los primeros puntos de contacto entre tu sitio y los usuarios, así como los algoritmos de búsqueda, por lo que debe ser claro, relevante y atractivo para ambos."},{"prompt":"crea un titulo seo par la pagina de inicio donde los podcas son de varios contenidos","completion":"Al crear un título SEO para una página de inicio con una amplia gama de temas en tus podcasts, querrás reflejar la diversidad del contenido sin hacer que el título sea demasiado genérico o diluido. Aquí tienes un ejemplo: \`\`\`html <title>Canal Total TV: Explora Podcasts de Actualidad, Ciencia y Cultura Pop</title> \`\`\` Este enfoque tiene en cuenta varios factores: - **Identificación de la marca**: \\"Canal Total TV\\" sigue estando al frente para un reconocimiento inmediato. - **Variedad de contenido**: \\"Actualidad, Ciencia y Cultura Pop\\" indica una amplia gama de temas sin ser excesivamente específico. - **Inclusión de palabras clave relevantes**: Incluye palabras como \\"Podcasts\\" y temas generales de alto interés que podrían ser buscados por los usuarios. - **Llamado a explorar**: El uso de \\"Explora\\" agrega un verbo de acción que invita al usuario a interactuar con el contenido. La longitud sigue siendo manejable para la visualización en los resultados de búsqueda y es suficientemente atractiva para incentivar a los usuarios a hacer clic. Además, es importante que adaptes el título a los términos específicos por los que tu audiencia tiende a buscar tus contenidos. Si encuentras que tu público está más interesado en otros temas que ofreces en tus podcasts, considera incluir esos temas en el título SEO. Por ejemplo, si tus podcasts son populares por cubrir temas de tecnología y estilo de vida, podrías redactar algo como: \`\`\`html <title>Canal Total TV | Podcasts de Tecnología, Estilo de Vida y Más</title> \`\`\` Considera realizar una investigación de palabras clave para identificar qué términos de búsqueda son más relevantes y populares entre tu público objetivo. Esto ayudará a que tu título sea lo más efectivo posible en términos de SEO y atracción de usuarios."},{"prompt":"podria valer exproa podcast de todo tipo de contenido?","completion":"Sí, puedes utilizar un enfoque más generalizado en tu título SEO para englobar una amplia variedad de contenidos. Aquí tienes un ejemplo que refleja esa aproximación general: \`\`\`html <title>Explora Podcasts de Todo Tipo - Canal Total TV</title> \`\`\` Este título transmite un mensaje de variedad y curiosidad, lo que podría ser atractivo para los oyentes que buscan una gama diversa de temas. \\"Explora\\" funciona como una invitación a descubrir todo lo que ofrece tu canal. Al colocar \\"Canal Total TV\\" al final, aseguras que la marca sigue siendo parte integral del título, mientras la apertura del título captura la curiosidad del oyente potencial. Sin embargo, es relevante señalar que un enfoque demasiado amplio en el título SEO puede no ser tan efectivo para los motores de búsqueda si el término no tiene suficiente demanda de búsqueda o si es demasiado genérico. Un título que abarca \\"todo tipo de contenido\\" puede no reflejar lo suficientemente los temas específicos que podrían estar buscando los usuarios y puede diluir el enfoque SEO. Por esto, es importante equilibrar la generalidad con algún grado de especificidad basado en lo que tu audiencia realmente busca y valora. Si tu canal cubre verdaderamente un espectro muy amplio de temas y quieres mantener ese enfoque general en tu título SEO, podrías considerar agregar elementos que lo hagan destacar, como tu valor único o una llamada a la acción más distintiva.

Hoy vamos a hablar sobre los problemas laborales, que son situaciones o desafíos que pueden surgir en el entorno del trabajo y que afectan a la productividad, la satisfacción laboral y las relaciones entre empleados y empleadores. Algunos de los problemas son los conflictos en el lugar del trabajo, las diferencias entre la personalidad y opiniones hostiles de trabajo que pueden dar lugar a conflictos entre colegas y los conflictos no resueltos que pueden afectar negativamente el ambiente laboral y disminuir la productividad. 00:00:59:07 – 00:01:27:19 Desconocido La comunicación deficiente donde los problemas de comunicación, ya sean empleados, equipos o entre empleados y empleadores, pueden dar lugar a malentendidos. Falta de claridad en las expectativas de errores en la ejecución de tareas. La falta de reconocimiento de recompensas por el trabajo bien hecho puede afectar la moral de los empleados y sus compromisos por la empresa. La ausencia de programas de recompensas o incentivos también pueden generar insatisfacción laboral. 00:01:27:21 – 00:01:50:08 Desconocido Los empleados pueden enfrentarse también a través de estrés y agotamiento si la carga de trabajo es excesiva o desequilibrada. Y esto puede deberse a una mala gestión de recursos o la falta de planificación adecuada. La discriminación basada en género de raza, edad u otros factores, así como el acoso laboral, son problemas serios que afectan el bienestar de los empleados y crean un entorno laboral tóxico. 00:01:50:11 – 00:02:15:03 Desconocido La ausencia del portal de oportunidades discapacitadas de capacitación y desarrollo profesional puede llevar a la desmotivación y el estancamiento laboral. Los empleados suelen valorar las oportunidades para aprender y crecer en sus roles. La incertidumbre sobre la estabilidad del empleo. La falta de transparencia en la toma de decisiones o cambios constantes en las empresas pueden generar ansiedad entre los empleados. 00:02:15:06 – 00:02:37:02 Desconocido Problemas también de equilibrio entre el trabajo y la vida personal. Porque hay una presión constante para cumplir con los demás. A las demandas. Demandas laborales que puede afectar negativamente el equilibrio entre trabajo y la vida personal y lo que lleva a problemas de salud y bienestar. La insatisfacción con la remuneración y los beneficios puede ser también una fuente, una fuente importante de descontento laboral. 00:02:37:05 – 00:03:06:05 Desconocido Los empleados pueden sentirse valorados si no se compensa adecuadamente. La falta del liderazgo efectivo puede contribuir en muchos de los problemas mencionados anteriormente. Un liderazgo deficiente puede resultar en una falta de dirección, falta de apoyo y la falta de motivación dentro de lo que es el equipo. Para ello comenzamos nuestro primer programa con un invitado. Él es Carlos Martín y es un afectado laboral. 00:03:06:10 – 00:03:59:17 Desconocido ¿Bienvenido Carlos, cómo estás? Como muchos, bien. Todo lo bien que nos permite un astrónomo dentro de dentro de lo que es la situación laboral en la que tú te has sentido afectado. ¿Cómo podríamos? Cuéntanos un poquito como. Como es la historia. Un estudio resume muy bien y como has hecho el intrusismo a este tu programa, porque todo deriva sobre su nuevo médico y es sobre uno y oculto el trabajo y lo acude respondón porque son Ramón Diego, momento en el que la empresa. 00:03:59:17 – 00:04:34:26 Desconocido Pues bien, y si fue así, directamente futuro de su imagen. ¿Utilizar una imagen o la imagen, pues no es muy agradable tener un trabajo duro en el cual urge moverse y no de uno bueno todo, que no se siente bien, que trabajando un poco forzado no? Entonces ya te obligan, bien por tu salud, eso es lógico, pero bueno, por el margen derecho de la empresa puesto por lo bajo y su ubicación. 00:04:34:28 – 00:05:35:02 Desconocido Y el caso de coger la baja, pues todo se alargó a que tomó lo que quedaba y 18 meses y me encuentro con que esos 18 meses a mi no se me han hecho ningún tipo de pruebas y en definitiva no tengo diagnóstico de lo que es lo que me sucede a mi. Y transcurrió este tiempo, me cogen y me llaman de inspección médica y sin tener un diagnóstico y un tratamiento y automáticamente me dan el alta y mi sorpresa es que me lo que es el paro, lo que es y lo que te han quitado, cotizando los dos, trabajando ha sido función. 00:05:35:02 – 00:06:32:23 Desconocido Me lo da haber cumplido los 18 meses de baja y bueno, y te encuentras en que no quieres ni tu dinero, que oscuridad y ni te encuentras que no tienes ningún tipo de ayuda. Y todo esto se deriva a que una baja y una mala asistencia como la prótesis mobbing practices porque y en 18 meses con mi no se me ha hecho nada y cinco siempre han sido como largos, entonces te ves con una edad y ves que ya el mercado laboral y me exigen o requieren otras cosas y no te dan opciones siquiera por tener una entrevista y entonces te ves súper perdido, no poder. 00:06:32:24 – 00:07:19:05 Desconocido Y si hubiera algún tipo de salida por personas que me soy uno y yo tengo un blog y yo soy bueno, no soy mayor, pero si que el mercado laboral parece ser que yo soy un poco invisible, no tu por decir que llevo unos meses y sin valor a diariamente, diariamente y reviso plataformas y títulos o puntuando filtros y trabajo y los que lo que son yo valgo ni siquiera por punto de vista Dios todo y pues cada tres meses los tienen uno por uno. 00:07:19:05 – 00:08:16:08 Desconocido ¿Entrevista y obviamente su entrevistado pues no sale como tiene que salir y como no les interesó la persona en Sepulveda no, yo me estoy encontrando con eso que hasta ahora no imaginaba que una cosa así pudiera sucederme, pero y claro, y lo se, fue mamona disfrutando los locución y turismo que hago? ¿Que te ves que no tienes ningún tipo de duda y trabajan y te pones y te buscas trabajo por lo que vivir porque no queda otro y te encuentras en que no hay sitio por ti, simplemente y llanamente estas comentando el tema de la edad, no? 00:08:16:09 – 00:09:07:20 Desconocido ¿Que la edad es algo muy importante a partir de que edad más o menos te dicen que ya no puedes trabajar? ¿Los que esto es un poco ridículo no? ¿Porque lo creo que es la retención o punto tonto como muy bien como lo están haciendo, no? Porque a mí por ejemplo, y luego los 40 años ya no te miran como los que no, entonces piensan que con 40 años o a lo mejor pues no como sucesión temporal o lo tuyo, por ejemplo, yo lo tuve cubierto y Dios pues Dios Oliva. 00:09:07:23 – 00:09:44:10 Desconocido Y bueno, esto es un poco que he dicho, sí, prácticamente todo, pero cortártelo un culo húmedo solamente y cortártelo y no he sido un sido auto que a lo entrevistó Rojo Y ojo, no entiendo el tema de que no seas apto a causa de de cortártelo con con un cutter. Yo lo veo un poco irrisorio. ¿Y crees que tiene que ver algo con con con tu edad que decías que tenías a aproximadamente unos 40 años? 00:09:44:12 – 00:10:19:14 Desconocido ¿Si, si, si, si, si, si, porque lujo más? Yo lo vivo como sólidos y en lo personal que he y querido comprar o he tenido que cambiar de trabajo por circunstancias, por cabello. Sabemos que muchos empleos a veces no los justos como yo en Tijuana, como yo en kilos, porque viajando bien y a veces he cambiado de trabajo y no tuve ningún problema y siempre ha sido como que casi al 100% las entrevistas que ha llevado hacer y no han sido efectivas. 00:10:19:16 – 00:10:47:15 Desconocido Y ahora pues me encuentro totalmente lo contrario. Los que nos que son efectivos es que ya no, no te ofrecen la oportunidad de hacerlo estando listo en tu curriculum o en tu edad, por ejemplo. Y yo directamente yo no estoy teniendo ningún tipo listo esto lo que vivo, entrevistas de trabajo cada tres meses, uno con suerte. Esto es lo que estoy pidiendo solo. 00:10:47:18 – 00:11:51:05 Desconocido ¿Desde cuando llevas buscando, buscando trabajo? Pues yo como tu es tu función o como funciona Yo antes de estando yo yo ya iba moviendo un poco y viendo poco último para ver si era el momento de que me vieran. Solución Pues poder incorporarme y tener un poco presente. Quiero decirte yo estaba muy latente lo que no gusto lo de trabajo y cual es tu problema, que hasta que un médico no oscuro no te dan un alto o no y con la solución y no sabes ni los escritorios o la habitación, la luz y los videos y uno tiene su alma muy puro, entonces uno sin sus lujos no se gana muchísimo. 00:11:51:05 – 00:12:41:06 Desconocido Antes de que me diciembre me dieron pronto el nueve en el último año y buscando. El problema es que cuando ya te dan el alto descubres su social y por ley lo que es así se queda con el dinero que tu has cotizado trabajando. No tienes opción A y por U pues entonces cuando y tienes que correr los cuatro y si servicio estamos diciendo yo bien bien bien, no tengo diagnosticado, tengo que surplus ahí, pero yo ya por lo social no pudo o bien no me el no me no lo oigo de modo entonces tengo que hacerlo. 00:12:41:08 – 00:13:28:20 Desconocido Que manera tengo un centro sin poder donde no use plus, que ya no se trata de eso, no se trata de que yo me pongo a trabajar, intento aguantar como puedo a solucionar un problema nuevos, si no se todos pido. No te dan la opción de hacer una entrevista y solo porque si y no somos lo me he encontrado con el problema de que y si quiero entrevista y estamos hablando de que a lo mejor son en tres o cuatro o cinco ofertas mínimas los 15 minutos diarios, incluso ahora mismo por varias aplicaciones soluciones. 00:13:28:20 – 00:14:02:18 Desconocido Abrimos Puerto Sol en varias plataformas, en varias aplicaciones y luego incluso en la misma se acomodo. Y es increíble porque somos incontrolables por el que que perdió su trabajo y su trabajo y su trabajo es ocultándote y entregando curriculums y dando vueltas y por por muchos sitios ligeramente poco formados en sus sitios y. Y si, si dejó curriculum y bueno vale cero voto y debemos pero hay sitio tuvo éxito. 00:14:02:23 – 00:14:32:09 Desconocido O sea, es que yo es una cosa que no me acabo de explicar porque es que nunca me es posible buscar una persona que usted nunca me ha pasado, un en una situación en la que sin conseguir un fruto de su trabajo diarias que son mínimas, lo que nosotros, lo que te puntos es que no te llaman para hacer una entrevista, es que estamos hablando de hombres y muchos conflictos de trabajo, o las cúpulas o puntos, pero no te damos tiempo. 00:14:32:09 – 00:14:58:28 Desconocido Joan No, no, no, no, no, te hacen una entrevista y yo no sé si es porque hay mucha demanda, si es por gusto un solo momento, pero esto siempre se ha dicho que a una cierta edad las empresas ya no no ven rentable para cuando y yo estoy seguro y la gente pudo vivir. Bueno, pues podrá pensarlo que todo. 00:14:58:28 – 00:15:43:27 Desconocido Yo estoy seguro de lo que yo sé de algunos y. Y por supuesto, claro, muchos en tu juventud, muchos jóvenes que hablan el doble de que yo, no por supuesto que si, pero tal como está ahí la cosa, yo creo que no es así. La juventud no es que tuvimos la oportunidad de eso, es que uno por la edad no puedes juzgar por que y por que pudo tener más nervio y más capacidad y más y más ganas, más lógica y un poco de más cuidado, no que a la hora de trabajar que por su tiempo. 00:15:43:27 – 00:16:25:21 Desconocido Bueno, que lo no menos propio de la juventud, al contrario, no los que la vida y que siguen adelante y solo vive un que ejemplo popular. Pero y si que sabemos que el jóvenes que a cada edad cuestionan sus isotopos y entonces curiosos se topan, pero los jóvenes y no dejan de ser jóvenes y por su futuro de valor y atención, manejando una herramienta, un cuchillo, un recurso, los ejemplos y más valiente o mejor peligro por nuevos y derrotando. 00:16:25:24 – 00:16:57:26 Desconocido ¿Y yo creo que personas que por ejemplo tenemos no solo a todos los años nuestra edad, pues si que vamos a tener como reguladores y debemos ser un poco más un cabeza no? Porque es lo que nos tocó, somos muy maduros en ese sentido como comentabas, pero pasamos por un tribunal médico, un joven, fue lo que se llama laboral, cómo te trataron a través de lo que es la inspección medica directamente. 00:16:57:28 – 00:17:49:05 Desconocido En ese sentido, al tenerte obligado no a dejar tu puesto laboral, pues y totalmente abandonado, totalmente abandonado porque y si que ha pasado 18 meses, pero estamos hablando de que ayudar a un especialista o incluso porque médicos un año y luego un especialista y tuve dos o tres visitas y nada más. Y con eso y esto, los viejos, los 18 meses y sin tener un diagnóstico, sin tener una o dos opciones y tener incluso más solución, algo solido por donde tirar un horno, un horno. 00:17:49:07 – 00:18:23:14 Desconocido Los que no tenemos video y no se sabe y todo muy ok, nos tocó y un auto simplemente y llanamente llegó allí y no quiso saber nada de informes, no quiso saber nada, simplemente dos puntos y uno supuesto futuro porque y yo no sé si y es altura era la correspondiente lo que a mi me debería haber visto por mi aceptación. 00:18:23:16 – 00:18:54:06 Desconocido ¿En este caso subió a un aviso esto, luego me dijo esto, luego entonces yo no sé si esa persona y la ONU y sus teólogos y justo luego no sé si esa persona los visualiza o no, solo sé que lo preguntas y cinco minutos y unos días y el otro y que haces denuncia porque? Y luego me puse en contacto con abogados médicos que no tienen otra salida y si quieres resolución no es así. 00:18:54:06 – 00:19:24:00 Desconocido Como he escuchado, han ido a un caso claro de persona que está mal y lleva ya dos años esperando a que le digan algo. Ha tenido resultado, a que le hagan algo y eso no es ilegal y luego que los obligado si de un monstruo de las certezas y los abogados y trabajan bien con esto el roji y te windows, la situación en el que no hay entrevista ninguna. 00:19:24:02 – 00:19:38:07 Desconocido Pues yo sinceramente lo digo abiertamente, admiro su posición, está acabando con mi vida. Y así simplemente y llanamente. 00:19:38:10 – 00:20:30:29 Desconocido Dos años cobrando muy poco con una casa, con un niño de sobre la delante, con todo el mundo, con sus problemas o montando un no puede el polvillo de dos años y que te encuentras que no hay solución, ni siquiera un poquito. ¿Trabajan? Uno puede pues yo no soy muy rotundo, no estoy muy contento del Seguro Social por la situación médica y el trato que que recibo, no porque y en mi caso puedo decir que gracias o una doctora en tópicos de mi especialidad, de lo que es la fundación, manifestó de sus prácticas divorcios. 00:20:31:01 – 00:20:59:24 Desconocido A eso redujo el doctor le dijo el ajuste, ustedes como lo tomó, dijo si soy hombre, lo leí y la altura, las pláticas estuvo. Entonces ellos como lo dijo, porque usted llegó y fue en cuestión de nada. Por lo tanto yo amo a Dios. Motul en alguna ocasión y ella en su vida en un futuro y conseguir otro con un carro deportivo. 00:20:59:26 – 00:21:31:28 Desconocido Y bueno, yo hice una prueba de cumple y por un lado pero mi caso fue por un auto, los propios los vi y a un gracias un huevo esto atorado. ¿Tu crees que en cuestión de salud pública bueno mencionas el tema de los inspectores, que en varias redes ha habido diferentes programas relacionados con con la inspección médica y el trato que reciben en el cual es tu equitativo o no? 00:21:31:29 – 00:22:06:06 Desconocido Porque dentro de lo que es la inspección, los especialistas que te miran naturalmente no tienen especialidades. En muchas de las patologías. Por otra parte, referente a la vocación medicinal, no tengo más, más vocación o una persona que está en prácticas que luego quizá a lo mejor a través del tema económico, esa vocación la tomé más como como un un sistema de recaudación y el trato sea irrisorio. 00:22:06:06 – 00:22:33:05 Desconocido No porque tienes una enfermedad, tienes algo que se te ha descubierto y han tardado también dos años, lo cual te ha perjudicado a nivel laboral. No, porque tendrías que estar de baja, en lo cual tenías que estar cobrando una prestación. Pero me ha llamado mucho la atención una cosa que has dicho referente a que la Seguridad Social te está quitando todo el dinero. 00:22:33:08 – 00:23:21:15 Desconocido Entonces me gustaría saber un poco de como es ese, ese, ese sentido en el que la Seguridad Social te está quitando el dinero que tú ya has cotizado. Y bueno, pues esos son horribles, es un dinero que los incluso recuerdo con comillas por haberlo produjo una ocasión tuvimos una relación muy estrecha y y recuerdo haber hablado de que esta ley existía un grupo que cuando llegó un momento en el que yo fui a solicitar mi prestación, mi paro, pues cierto, como que cobró, lo es, es una ley que es una ley que existe y te dan todo el derecho. 00:23:21:18 – 00:23:55:21 Desconocido Y entonces una vez que por suerte un poco de instrucción o tiempo de baja, los lo social duro y luego quitando de lo que es la y lo cotizado Toulouse. Pero en definitiva mi baja laboral me lo he pagado yo porque soy en definitiva por mi baja laboral lo he pagado, pero en este caso tú recibes lo que es una prestación económica debido A1A1 despido. 00:23:55:23 – 00:24:29:18 Desconocido ¿Lo que lo que yo no entiendo es que estando de baja vale realmente la seguridad social te tiene que estar pagando por estar de baja, no? Pero tu y tu derecho al al al paro directamente. ¿Juliano yo no hay derecho al pago directamente a nuestros de baja suposición eh? Y se quedo con un culo el y si no es suficiente y seguido ayudan el dinero cuando lo tengas. 00:24:29:20 – 00:25:08:25 Desconocido O sea que te vas a meter en lo que es una deuda y todo por todos y por eso un plus no ha sido suficiente. Lo que me quitó un amigo de lo que es mi de cotización o de mi, me los guardo y respondo que paro todo el mundo podemos si no es suficiente o no consideran que es suficiente a lo que yo vaya generando e los puestos de miran y lo han quitado por por eso ojo hasta cubrir lo que tengo que cubrir, pero cuando no menos es al 100% no lo se. 00:25:08:28 – 00:26:06:16 Desconocido Y bien, no dudo todo ya que pedir información y investigar más, pero es cierto que siguen, siguen derecho y luego. Y bueno, pude incorporarme como lo hice de intento de poder incorporarme a trabajar y a la hora de hacerme el contrato me mandaron, me dieron un contrato de oro, logramos, no era un contrato como lo monto todo, yo tuve que aceptar otro curso y ellos me veían y sabían que yo estaba mal por lo trabajar los muy octubre y los aviones al principio y decidieron hacernos un contrato de horas, unos nos cobrando ni de 20 horas semanales tampoco. 00:26:06:18 – 00:26:39:00 Desconocido Entonces y justamente obtuvimos un día porque primero no hubo médico y estando incluso en un hospital que tiene que estar 1 millón de de ingreso, el hospital, pues ahí recibí un mensaje en el cual el comunicado que y por medio pasó el periodo de prueba y fui despedido, incluso eso fueron unos días de los cuales tuve un contratado previamente. 00:26:39:00 – 00:27:28:18 Desconocido ¿Estuve sin contrato un tiempo porque uno que cuando te dejan sin nada a últimos que hacer y estuve poquito sin, sin un contrato hasta que me encontraron con el contrato, pero lo he comentado de que no, no era lo que buscaba en español y la sorpresa fue que cuando ellos lo ingresado por hacérmelo todo directamente ilegalmente, me elevo mensaje y como digo, no todos vivimos y eso perjudicó lo de cotizar perjudico también, pero ese despido improcedente y luego el tema del engaño con con con lo de las horas, no sé, tienes un contrato estipulado de que es no? 00:27:28:18 – 00:28:17:16 Desconocido Normalmente son creo que 48 horas los que las que se trabajan como como te han podido engañar en ese sentido el engaño fue verbal y es una empresa al monopolio y me comunicaron públicamente estaban por un poco de exceso de trabajo y pues julio empeoraron. Por último, entonces por lo que ves, la que no tienes nada, ves que no es lo que debes hacer, porque lo suyo es que ustedes cotizaron y los social quieren plus tenido de mentores o cotizados como todo el mundo y entonces pues como poder no te de medio entre los ahí. 00:28:17:18 – 00:28:51:07 Desconocido Luego pues como 2000 opiniones o 20 disgustos. Entonces pues luego sucedió esto, vamos a contratar un módulo. Vuelvo a lo de contratarme, me dicen bueno, pues lo vamos a hacer como por media jornada de contrato de media jornada sin contrato entonces no, que otra cosa. Y aceptas, pero pero bueno, luego me voló lo del contrato, no era un mejor lugar, no eran 20 horas semanales, hubieron muchos menos. 00:28:51:09 – 00:29:27:27 Desconocido Acepto igual, pero no porque no habría más remedio. Por lo que pierdes un porque vas a prueba Médico uno Yo iba yo dos años luchando por aquí a concursos. ¿Digo soy y tu despido? Pues bueno. Y sí, totalmente legal, totalmente legal porque el contrato se firmó mucho después y entraba en el periodo de prueba y al entrar en el periodo de prueba pues no me quedó otro. 00:29:27:29 – 00:29:56:09 Desconocido Y al el problema pues usted, tú encuentras en que mi entrevista supo esto. Pues bien, derroteros que no encuentras entre ellos tu tu piensas por ejemplo en en este sentido, dentro, dentro de lo que de lo que estas contando en primer lugar. Bueno, pues lo del tema de la jornada, que son unas horas pagadas legalmente, pero hay otras horas que están pagadas en negro, no en la doble jornada. 00:29:56:12 – 00:30:54:13 Desconocido Pero tu crees que queda algún rastro, no en alguna oficina o o en el mismo paro en el cual directamente te dicen como si tuvieras un historial no para, para de negarte un trabajo. Y bueno, yo no sé bien si si lo que hacen es de menor tiempo, porque realmente si miras las ofertas que hay y por los o no lo que se ve de un volumen a ver, son ofertas para médicos delineantes como frutos con titulación, como frutos con estudios y no se por que móvil tu copia. 00:30:54:16 – 00:31:30:21 Desconocido Los que dicen eso porque busco vino y luego se quejan de que no te lo un sobre régimen por ejemplo. Y siempre me encuentro trabajos que es que no son productivos. ¿No tengo tantos estudios porque no monto, incluso algunos lo haces voy a andar no? ¿Y entonces pues yo no dinero, los estudios de dinero, oportunidades, sus trabajos no son problema y si que te obligan a que aceptes un trabajo que ellos te ofrezcan no? 00:31:30:23 – 00:32:03:00 Desconocido A mi me han llamado y me han dicho mucho enviar curriculum, esto puesto cuyos derechos tu oferta ya la he visto y estos frutos piden esto, esto y esto y yo no tengo esto, esto y esto. Unos igual, pero lo enviaremos porque no sé ustedes, porque así la verdad es que o delante de 8%. Pero y si yo ya no me apunto porque están pidiendo los cursos, los colegios, tengo uno o Burton junto al mis lo hacen y estupendo, estupendo. 00:32:03:00 – 00:32:42:27 Desconocido Si te cuento mis un trabajo estupendo, pero es que somos muy pocas veces. Yo en este tiempo tuve un llamado ellos lo dije lo mucho y luego pues es lo que digo diariamente, otros de muchos mecanismos, muchos rendimientos del punto Frutos y no conseguir no consiguió hacer un montón y esto lo venimos correcto repitiendo y es verídico y no le digo nada al pues no es que los estudios y no tenemos las capacidades y las cualidades de cualquier otra persona. 00:32:42:28 – 00:33:19:21 Desconocido Entiendo que hay personas que no los tienen por por algún accidente, una enfermedad, lo que sea, pero es que en su principio la juventud no tuvo algún bien y los y los sociólogos mucho. Y luego nos mira. A mi me dio la léfono y a nadie de proximidad social que supe que el muevo y uno nueva ayuda nueva ayudo de tanto de cuanto los requisitos de los que suscribe por no saber los requisitos. 00:33:19:21 – 00:33:58:29 Desconocido Y es que dices que interesa ayudar a los que tienen o los que tienen porque hay requisitos que dices es imposible, es imposible, entonces no hay, no ayudas, no hay. Yo por ejemplo, estoy en defensor en el sentido de que vas allí a coger uno bueno, pues te dan el alto porque ellos dicen porque no te quedó remedio, porque tienes que callar ante ellos, pues cosas del punto, pelear tienes que por ellos y que ocuparon no lo tienes directamente. 00:33:59:02 – 00:34:51:22 Desconocido ¿Entonces que haces? No puedes trabajar porque tienes una afectación y no puedes otras ayudas propios que no te dan la opción. ¿Y entonces que haces? Si tu vas a buscar trabajo y que se suele decir vulgarmente un loco y luego nos llaman para otro de entre estos yo de la última entrevista con un amigo y yo ya le decía Mosque con que programa de porque yo yo el lunes empiezo a trabajar y no porque y me dicen pero como te han dicho nada, no su alcance y súbitamente pero quiero ir en coche y si no positivo, digamos hacia negro por decirlo de una manera, no que trabajo y digo he quitado la idea de decir 00:34:51:22 – 00:35:21:04 Desconocido no, esta vez va a ser que si he hecho una entrevista no es solo y contento, puede ser positivo y voy a preparar la mente para que el lunes otro rollo el con muchos ganas y los que me re funcional y los que Luis lo incluye. Se opuso el contundente positivo. Ahora lo positivo y difícil o lo hice en la entrevista, estoy contento, creo que ha salido bien, ha salido estupendo e el trabajo. 00:35:21:09 – 00:36:03:03 Desconocido Como he dicho, he mencionado antes, un metro en qt importante. Lo que yo pensé se dio por bueno, vale pues y para por ello el audiovisual. Nosotros he vivido en que soy una persona bastante nerviosa, bastante, y su modelo ágil y no Celso escultor, pero algún QTE pues volo puesto en rojo de pero hombre yo a mi me suelo lucir, pero cuando ves que haces una entrevista y al día siguiente nosotros te diremos sucio, si no lo siguiente te dicen homologado y de que no y polvo. 00:36:03:05 – 00:36:57:11 Desconocido Bonito problema mayor respeto, no uso el auto por todos los trabajos, muchos mas en lo. Pero si yo hago lo. La reivindicación de que el y cuidado con con estudio, relato y cuidado con el sobre los trabajos porque estuvo no es lo mismo justicia y unos piden golpe los impresos con muy poca dato es que una con 40 años hoy en día sobre todo que como el vivió mucho, gente que hoy en día los los no orientados a los niños pueden dos solos, no 20 no hubo de que dicen lo que tenemos esperanza de vida o porque tenemos más más o son como que los alumnos bueno pues somos uno y entonces E También hay 00:36:57:11 – 00:37:25:11 Desconocido personas que nos cuidamos y personas que bueno, pues intentamos y estoy un poco bien, un poco agilidad, un poco, pero los que no nos dan la oportunidad porque se ofreció una entrevista y dio la entrevista yo te desechan, son los que yo no es su problema, te toman la entrevista y no te cojan, es que son problemas que no quieran hacer entrevistas. 00:37:25:14 – 00:37:50:03 Desconocido Yo esto lo vengo diciendo a suburbios y olivos, que es increíble. Yo no me lo esperaba muy pronto de de arrestada verme en esa situación, tener que buscar trabajo obligatoriamente y sin saber que va a pasar con mi salud y que no puedo acceder a un trabajo, estudio, estudios políticos, todos está pasando y esta pasando. ¿Si, pero el tema de que? 00:37:50:03 – 00:38:20:13 Desconocido ¿De que no puedas conseguir ningún tipo de trabajo por x o o por y que? ¿A ver, el que tendría por ejemplo una entrevista digamos no, yo lo veo un poco un poco irrisorio, no? A nivel a nivel laboral, que te estén negando algo a lo que tu necesitas, podríamos decir que es esa, esa entrevista para para ese puesto de trabajo. 00:38:20:16 – 00:39:13:26 Desconocido Si lo supieran la al otro amigo al simplemente no tiene de respuesto la empresa que se pone en contacto conmigo y pido son entrevistado Yo obviamente no lo voy a decir, pues no, dicen que si, entonces si no tiene el llamado Luis Enrique, incluso en esta entrevista anterior no la otro yo hace tres meses lo menos que hice e lo estudiando por teléfono, insistiendo después de la entrevista y lo condujo de su dos tres o cuatro días a ver circulo estaba cubierto, puesto e insistiendo e que tuvieran un poco de interés en y lo muy serio da un poco de nada que decir a sus cursos y no te sirve de nada. 00:39:13:28 – 00:39:44:01 Desconocido ¿Yo no sé si un joven cuando va a buscar trabajo y hace una entrevista, pero luego pues los todos los días pendiente y llamo a la empresa diciendo pues bueno, que si esta oculto trabajo y si ya se habían decidido no? ¿Y entonces yo no creo que un joven de de por hacer eso no? Y y de hecho yo en alguna ocasión si que lo he hecho, pero por puro interés, no por bueno compartir su interés en lo que te interese. 00:39:44:01 – 00:40:14:12 Desconocido El trabajo como pero que ahora te obligan salvo obligan y a unos y a los lugares. Yo estoy encontrando en que lo puedo. No es sólido lo que hay que reinventarse ahora mucha gente no la de hicieron aquí, reinventarse. Yo estoy totalmente de acuerdo y hay que reinventarse, pero nosotros, tu tiempo y el dinero para reinventarte, si es que tampoco te dan opción, pero son los que trabajan y no te llevas un salario que lleva. 00:40:14:14 – 00:41:07:15 Desconocido Tampoco te dan la opción, por ejemplo, a través de los cursos del SEPE, por ejemplo, no a poder realizar el el trabajo en curso. Para para, para que te encuentres ese ese ese trabajo, aunque sea como decías antes, para, para cortar con con un cuter, tela o yo creo que es algo que debería no el el estado en este, en este caso dentro del Ministerio de Trabajo, ayudar un poco a las personas que están desempleadas, porque si realmente no hay ningún ninguna ayuda, por lo que por lo que estoy escuchando de que viene, viene naturalmente, esto es nuevo y ofrecerte en circuito profesional ayuda a su difusión en torno a Pilar y educación sólidos en 00:41:07:15 – 00:41:47:15 Desconocido ¿el sentido de lo que te hacen uso estas en cursos y quienes son? Julen abrió ahí y también tuvo cursos, pero son cursos muy largos. Son cursos que mientras los haces como los no, no te pagan, tuyo probablemente no y luego no es uno, uno o dos diarios. Estamos hablando que es un cursos de cinco horas diarios y tuvimos una familia o no tuvimos una familia, un trabajo que es muy complicado, bueno, pero debería haber por ejemplo un un curso que sea remunerado. 00:41:47:20 – 00:42:33:23 Desconocido Por ejemplo si tu vas a estudiar informática porque te quieres dedicar al tema de la informática, por poner un ejemplo, que ese curso ya que viene de una entidad pública en la cual tu no tienes ningún tipo de prestación económica por X o por porque no o demás, yo creo que debería de ser un curso remunerado, no antiguamente no, por ejemplo a los a los jóvenes que se acababan por ejemplo el graduado escolar a través de ayuntamientos hacían una escuela de mayores que era sacarse el graduado escolar, más luego ejercer dentro de las optativas a un puesto de trabajo en el cual no era mucho dinero. 00:42:33:26 – 00:43:19:25 Desconocido ¿Se pagaba, no? Entonces yo creo que debería de haber un caso así más en este caso, por ejemplo, con con personas ya de una edad comprendida, en los cuales son unos 40 años, que es cuando ya directamente las empresas dejan de llamarte porque ya no les interesas, porque eres insuficiente para las empresas debido a esa edad. Yo pienso directamente que bueno, tampoco hay una insuficiencia de edad porque todo el mundo es hábil, todo el mundo puede trabajar en lo que sea, no por por, por temas así tu en este momento tu no tienes ningún tipo de discapacidad tampoco, con lo cual puedes estar dentro de este mundo laboral correctamente, salvo esa patología que tu has 00:43:19:25 – 00:43:47:21 Desconocido mencionado antes que a causa de una inspección médica te dieron, te dieron de alta y perdiste el puesto de trabajo. ¿No has pensado en algún momento? ¿Aunque si creo que lo has pensado porque lo has comentado anteriormente de poner una demanda directamente, una segunda valoración por parte de la entidad médica, porque tampoco entiendo mucho que el paro te lo quiten, no? 00:43:47:23 – 00:44:22:09 Desconocido Y tengas que estar pagando tu propio paro a la seguridad social, que si bien con lo que estuve por tu espalda un médico tuyo a eso, pues no siempre me encuentro con eso solo si quiero con el sudor de soledad, pero Johannesburgo y Carito por un tiempo que Bruno unos estuvo en el gobierno, un kilillos que aprendí y me puso adelante no ante ellos. 00:44:22:11 – 00:44:47:08 Desconocido ¿Entonces se supone que debo renunciar ahora a los filósofos? Si bueno, puedes ponerte de pero todo eso el dinero y yo estamos hablando de en que si no puedes no te dejan salir adelante porque no tienes trabajo, no Dios ningún tu podido como todos en un clavo en renunciar a la solución si es que no tienes los medios. 00:44:47:08 – 00:45:33:05 Desconocido Hubo lóbulo con holgura. Bien, no creo que por mucho que yo pidiera justicia gratuita y es un tema, el bueno lo sufrió, sufrió el pues entonces hacer mucho ruido. ¿Pus quizás pienso yo, o son muchos? ¿Luego pienso y no nos conviene o no? A mi por ejemplo yo tengo miedo, plomo, luego la moneda, los ruido y bueno y los los sufrió reclusorios no, el que no se busque los mide unos para meterte en problemas, no los que que meterse con la instituciones públicas. 00:45:33:05 – 00:46:16:08 Desconocido Uno Yo solo pienso y como están las cosas hoy en día pues más. Y yo creo que es un poco da. Y también como se aprovechan ellos saben que la mayoría de gente no todo el conflicto opciones y y los van a de estudios de casos que gentes que tienen enfermedades graves y que tienen que estar supervisados y estamos hablando por ejemplo un gemelo del cáncer, no tienen uno su cuerpo, han padecido dos o tres y continuo que luchar para que le den la total por dios que ni siquiera le daban. 00:46:16:10 – 00:46:53:05 Desconocido Locutor Lo que es uno positivo con una persona que tiene cáncer de pulmón y cáncer de mama. Cáncer de los que una persona así y como uno puedes darle y medio de sustento económico mínimo para vivir como una pensión e historia irrisorio. Bueno pero cuando tienen enfermedades o sentir que es que encima del pulmón somos muy son muchos casos. 00:46:53:08 – 00:47:26:19 Desconocido Hay gente que por una pierna o trabajo y mil cosas y millones de situaciones y y son dando unas pensiones que no son adecuadas, entonces no pueden vivir y entonces lo momento que te vas encontrando en que y que haces que asistieron couch y ten deudas y que como se ha conseguir hacer un poco de ruido y tu quieres que estos son los como como se suele decir vulgarmente. 00:47:26:21 – 00:47:49:17 Desconocido Entonces es lo que digo. A mi no me quedó otra que sin poder, porque yo en el momento de que me pongo a trabajar no sé lo que voy a durar y tuvo que hacer todo el esfuerzo. Yo hago hincapié en que el trabajo cuando yo empecé a sentirme mal en ese trabajo, yo no se me notaba que estaba mal y lo vivo cada día. 00:47:49:17 – 00:48:16:26 Desconocido Trabajaba plomero, mudaban y lo cumplió. Pero la imagen que da de tu puede haber un visitante o pueda ver una visita o pueda ver por que ocurra y vaya a la empresa y ve a un trabajador no el cual se sintió y su trabajando y no puede pues no lo vi bien y no lo hicieron o porque Dios puso luz y nosotros aquí hay que guardar una imagen. 00:48:16:28 – 00:48:52:14 Desconocido ¿Entonces es ahí cuando me obligaron a tener no coger la hoja y ahí es cuando empieza todo el proceso en el que en 18 meses no me hacen nada, prácticamente me dan el alta especie técnica por haber transcurrido el tiempo, que sin tener un diagnostico, sin apenas ninguna prueba y los cuento de que por ley y de los locales si no si nada, entonces que remedio hay en tu ojo? 00:48:52:16 – 00:49:21:16 Desconocido Si, pero este puesto no lo encuentras no no, no no oportunidad debido o no pienso. Luego entre otros, al igual que el de los topos de África, como rondando pero dentro, dentro de lo que creo que es estar. ¿18 meses no? O con una patología y directamente que ya te digan no que que te dan de alta o a través de una inspección médica. 00:49:21:18 – 00:49:51:18 Desconocido ¿Y luego lo de la imagen del trabajo, eso me ha llamado muchísimo la atención, no? Que tienes que mantener una imagen dentro del trabajo, pero si es que si estas impedido porque tienes un problema. La empresa claro, la empresa debe de de guardar una imagen pues o tiene una imagen de la de vender un vehículo, guardar y guardar los imagen que yo los inquietud y se fuera empresario y hasta cierto punto lo podría entender, no en que lo que tu fuera un tonto si lo suyo no es un trabajador industrial. 00:49:51:18 – 00:50:26:29 Desconocido Juego en un trabajo y el en malas condiciones. Un día otro y otro y otro día, otro día. Se que no todos con cultura y un motivo que tu puede ser como los trabajo, pero hoy no tienes al tú tienes un trabajador no va a trabajar porque quiere a lo tienes haciendo un esfuerzo y manteniéndose y bueno paralelamente pues intentar con los los social que se hicieron cursos una vez que mil entre comillas no obligan a la baja. 00:50:27:01 – 00:51:21:21 Desconocido Y bueno, sabemos que un acompañamiento duro mutuo, lo que hace simplemente yo vivo, vivo semanas, he tenido visitas médicas, incluso tres o cuatro días por semana, pero claro, se te pasó un mes y me no, lo mejor hasta dentro de un mes y medio, dos meses no hubiese tenido una visita con uno, con otro lo otro. Entonces el lo mucho que visitaba una o dos veces al mes para nada, para nada, para hacer perder el tiempo y nada más, porque yo creo que la mutua y son médicos y no pueden resultar recetar medicación, pero si que pueden ayudar porque ellos, un jurado, un juramento y son médicos que son de mutuo acuerdo, donde el único 00:51:21:21 – 00:51:51:13 Desconocido medición que uno puede hacerles o son un seguimiento y no parlamento. Pero mi si que lo propusieron, es decir, en nuestro país me llevo mucho tiempo de baja que se le daba un plus mayor porque estamos pagando nosotros por ejemplo, no somos su hijo. Entonces yo considero que lo que he vivido también sucede en el mutuo ínfimo, pero no hacen bien su trabajo, porque en mi caso yo soy sano. 00:51:51:13 – 00:52:13:11 Desconocido ¿No? Le pregunto. Preguntaba al médico de la mutua, pero que se ocupó de eso y que es que que pudo decirle que le pudo ayudar al especialista, que es lo que tengo que hacer para que me hagan caso y el y un grupo y yo nada más firme contestó el amigo. Y eso se supone que es un médico que no tuvo hijos. 00:52:13:11 – 00:52:43:27 Desconocido Nada. Si claro, naturalmente, pero directamente yo creo que que el tema de las mutuas, que están muy ligadas también al tema de la seguridad social, no porque son e inclusive pueden darte darte de baja, pero tienen la involucración por parte de la empresa, no cuando tu eres despedido directamente de un trabajo estando de baja la mutua. ¿La mutua tiene que acarrear con con los gastos directamente de lo que es la la la tus gastos no? 00:52:43:29 – 00:53:16:25 Desconocido Y luego ya firmar lo que es el paro en si. Pero realmente lo que yo no entiendo es la situación a la cual has podido llegar tu estando ahora mismo en una situación precaria en la que tienes tu, tu familia, tienes tu casa y todo son gastos. ¿Cómo es vivir así? ¿Cómo puedes pagar o llegar a pagar? ¿Cuál es la metodología dentro de Si no tienes ingresos durante X tiempo, cómo puede sobrevivir? 00:53:16:27 – 00:54:03:22 Desconocido ¿No hay un no hay una ayuda que el gobierno te te de, por ejemplo, los asuntos sociales o o alguien a quien reclamar directamente no? Sinceramente, en los que lucho no puedo decidir si lo hace o no puedo hacerlo. Y hasta ahora y los que ni me lo explico como lo hago, lo fui guardando y mirando y borrando, claro, lo no pudo salir, no los que o quien pregunto el porque de sentarme en un banco, porque es que cada céntimo que me gasto e incluso innecesario y dinero que me va a faltar a final de mes, pues lo que me hago con todo es que el dinero que no tienes entonces y así luego el 00:54:03:22 – 00:54:59:21 Desconocido mirar el céntimo, el el no salido, el no hacer nada, el mirar, tu mirar todo y. Y claro, llevo que si que vas haciendo, vas haciendo, pero los modos no puedes. ¿Entonces solución, solución tu crees en si llamar a la asistente social? Yo con tu gusto. Y cuando empecé yo empecé y hablé con la asistente social y luego punto en mi caso y dije yo no quiero ayuda, yo solamente quiero que sepas que estoy de baja, que si un momento y lo que quiero ayuda, que sepas que mi situación y yo a lo largo de esos dos años he estado comunicándome con ellos y todo y no una llamado telefónico, con ellos no he recibido 00:54:59:21 – 00:55:33:00 Desconocido nada, el siempre estaba allí y no al contrario dando explicación y algo más. Ellos tu no me están haciendo caso, los que ellos tampoco, tu crees en nada. ¿Entonces ellos que me dijeron en un momento de que necesitas algo? Vale, miraremos que podemos hacer, pero me tienes que preparar x documentación, documentación que dices o incluso me piden y mi sentencia de divorcio, o sea porque quiero saber tu sentencia de divorcio situó los puso en considerar o pidió los. 00:55:33:00 – 00:56:26:06 Desconocido Y cuando quieras lo. Lo tomó porque repartió y los. Lo tengo repartido y como repartido por ti el mi sentencia de divorcio porque estoy viviendo no lo entiendo, perdón, simplemente veo que los pude compartido, por ejemplo en mi caso o cualquier cosa sin yo solo es que no entiendo, no entiendo. Yo tomo mucho por el futuro, mucho, entonces lo tomo mucho como muy bien de estoy muy yo parado en mi sentencia, porque en este caso las cosas son como son y bueno, pues te en mundo no hay un supuesto calmo y hubo un perito judiciales y cursos y 1 millón para bolsa o bien respaldado en esa sentencia creo que no tengo ningún problema, pero 00:56:26:08 – 00:57:00:21 Desconocido y no veo lógico ni veo justo en piloto donde repartirlo para solicitar un ayuda, lo cual no ayuda tampoco porque su solicitud no ayuda y por ejemplo dicen que lo ayudo conmigo. Luego le voy a pedir la ayuda familiar, la ayuda familiar de uno, con eso no tengo el pero lo que o lo que me vean que estoy coludido con el ordenador debido a estudiar. 00:57:00:24 – 00:57:22:21 Desconocido Si no voy a hablar de su ayuda los dudo porque esto es un trabajo y no lo su estudiar y lo ultimo que es un robo. ¿Pero vamos a la cuestión de que te den una ayuda directamente es la de conseguir un puesto o un puesto de trabajo para tener buenos ingresos y deshacerte de lo que es la ayuda, no? 00:57:22:24 – 00:58:08:07 Desconocido Yo uso uno, yo he tenido que solicitar ayuda incluso y cuando lo solicité por móvil lo solicitado, cuando me uso me dio un se me dio de alta y fui a buscar y por u e por móvil ha solicitado la ayuda. En ese momento incluso me enviaron penalizado. Me han quitado un mes de ayuda por eso yo dije pero si yo lo que quiero es trabajar, yo lo que si busco trabajo y encuentro trabajo y de hecho en con tu trabajo y me hicieron la jugada, esto del que estábamos juntos los dos conmigo y con el contrato y y por no solicitar la ayuda y me buscó trabajo y claro luego me despido de su 00:58:08:07 – 00:58:36:26 Desconocido ¿trabajo y luego me quedamos opción de solicitarlo por lo solicitas y te penalizan porque en su momento no viviste su propio y esto es lo lógico, pero esto es lo lógico, no? Y lo otro, lo más lógico y lógico, lo que haces que hacer. No puedo hacer nada. Son y hay leyes y son así y hay que vivir de de no sentir culpa. 00:58:36:28 – 00:59:14:03 Desconocido ¿Eso si, de otro modo no lo entiendo o no lo entiendo, pero y me lo tomo en discusión en este momento el tema de de las leyes yo creo que deberían de ser un poco reemplazarlas directamente, no tener una pequeña reforma a nivel laboral por se están enriqueciendo lo que son las empresas y los los los pobres empleados en este caso son los que pagan las consecuencias a raíz también de la salud pública que anda muy mal y me imagino tu en la situación que tu estas teniendo en este momento por tu salud mental, no? 00:59:14:03 – 00:59:45:29 Desconocido En este caso no estará muy muy cuerda que digamos. No quiero llamarte loco en este sentido. ¿De todos los tratamientos creo que te refieres proponiendo solo posibles y acepto muchísimo porque y en este caso yo lo hice queriendo ponerme el positivo, es decir, bueno, yo algunos hombres grabo otro, de pronto visto digo bien y tengo que prepararme y a ver el equipamiento, se me va el equipamiento último tipo murió y luego ves que no hay nada, no? 00:59:46:02 – 01:00:37:14 Desconocido Entonces y lo que tienes que hacer es luchar. Ellos, tu Dios en que yo lo hice, que viendo lo positivo y lo lo sé de seguros y que estaba la posibilidad de no está clarísimo, no suena mi trabajo mucho. Yo digo mi punto de vista, entonces no soy muy poco recordado por eso también lo busque que creció, no he pero si que estos dos días en el que aún sabiendo que lo hice queriendo o no, sabiendo que a su lado no hay sitio estos días en el que lo que nos ganamos como que muchas cosas no le dices en serio, con mucho trabajo, mucho que te esfuerces y que te ves rojo, pero no te 01:00:37:14 – 01:01:26:03 Desconocido queda otro que con los tuyos respirar el oído y continuar. Pero creo que si lo juventud y sobre todo gente más con gente menos fuerte que puedo pintar muchísimo, muchísimo, muchísimo. Porque simplemente el que de hecho y pienso que por ser no sus como otros grupos como llegar a final de mes y sin olvidar de que hay niños de por medio los cuales necesitan cosas, necesitan con el colegio, necesitan ropa, necesitan alimentación y los que como no son loco por así decirlo y son un bucle que solo haces que pensar en buscar solución, solución, solución, solución, su misión y. 01:01:26:05 – 01:02:05:21 Desconocido Y estos estudios y los consolida mucho y lo llevo ya sin tiempo y hubo mucho tiempo. Yo me dedico a eso. Mi vida es diariamente busco su visión, resolver problemas y buscar trabajo. Así paralelamente intentar que la filosofía y y como solución me visiten. Yo ya he dicho al respecto de esto, le he dicho doctora, he dicho a todos el con únicamente me estoy hundiendo, no puedo más y les he dicho incluso lo último visitó un especialista. 01:02:05:23 – 01:02:35:21 Desconocido Vamos a hacerte una resonancia y uno dice haces de lo Homeland yo yo por que yo no puedo, es que no puedo, es que veo que localismos que no tienes que acelerar si o si. Y llevo dos años con esto último que llevo dos años es como yo, descartando cosas. Vale, es posible descartando cosas porque no sabes bien bien lo que es, no nos yo el motivo que me paso y somos varios los señores y señora, yo me pudiera estar muriendo ahora mismo o pude haber muerto y no se me ha hecho ni se me hizo nada. 01:02:35:23 – 01:03:10:00 Desconocido ¿Entonces lo he dicho por propósito que sucederá? Nada. De hecho me hicieron también una biopsia que podía, que me ingresaron, que no porque fui despedido y cuando me hice una biopsia yo tuve que pelear mucho para ver mis propios resultados y hasta que no tuve la visita eh un mes y dos meses después de la biopsia con un especialista, yo no pude acceder a mis resultados de la adopción. 01:03:10:03 – 01:03:32:27 Desconocido Incluso una auto de coste cero. Fui allí y me dijo Yo no te puedo decir nada. Es que Sonsoles pensó y esto yo puedo decirte lo que pone aquí en el informe lucano encontrado Luca De hecho uno lo van encontró. Lo que han hecho solo soy yo, no porque tu punto escribió incluso mi doctor agradece, no tiene que informarte, no las pruebas, las cosas que me había dicho la especialista, que han sido dos los que yo no a todo. 01:03:33:00 – 01:03:54:22 Desconocido Encima el que uno de muchísima gente entiende que, pero si leete un poco un estudio al no gusto, no menos cognitivo, no lo se. Yo me fui de allí con mi doctor y lo deje, lo volvió loco porque como estúpido no resultó, resultó, hubo y a dos meses y lo mando al hospital si no lo hago esta mal. 01:03:54:25 – 01:04:14:29 Desconocido Hasta Montse me habló. Hubo otro, otro tuvo porque daba resultados. Perdona pues sucedió, lo hace todo como un dios que ordena no los dos, no ayuda el especialista el día de la visita o el o tu lo de cabecera y lo y y la otro de cabeza no vale. Me dieron 15 días, no va a cambio en 15 días. 01:04:14:29 – 01:04:37:10 Desconocido ¿Y si llevo dos meses esperando los resultados, cómo puedes decir que te quedan 15 días, que te quedan 15 días para el parto y para ir al especialista y que los periodistas no digan lo contrario y llevarnos de luto las cosas a vivir? Porque es que por lo menos directamente yo creo que que aunque el especialista te haya te haya mirado. 01:04:37:13 – 01:04:59:23 Desconocido Yo por ejemplo, cuando he ido AA1 centro médico a hacerme unas pruebas, aunque no me lo habían dicho directamente a través de una biopsia o algo así, el mismo el mismo día. ¿Pero luego dicen los resultados los tendrás dentro de una semana, se los mandamos a tu médico de cabecera y el médico de cabecera es el hereje, por decirlo de alguna forma que que te va a informar no? 01:04:59:29 – 01:05:39:02 Desconocido ¿Pero yo creo que directamente en cuestiones de sanidad y demás deberían de haber muchísimos, muchísimos cambios, sobre todo en el tema de las listas de espera, porque las listas de espera son irrisorias, no? Una persona, como tu decías antes, con un cáncer a lo mejor no la operan tan rápido como como debería ser en el caso tuyo. Tu tienes aquí algo que es una resonancia de la cual te lo han descubierto hace poco y llevas mal desde hace dos años y directamente y gracias también a una persona que esta en prácticas. 01:05:39:02 – 01:06:05:03 Desconocido Sé que hay que recalcar nuevamente eso e ir y directamente tienes que seguir esperando a esos resultados, que si los hay. Yo fui a la autora del otro porque yo voy al hospital y le llevo mis resultados y directamente a otra persona o un experto listo, a ver, un especialista como yo en el mundo lo pruebo y lo mando y cito. 01:06:05:05 – 01:06:39:00 Desconocido Entonces la pruebas x Dios y hasta dentro de dos meses no tenía un listo, entonces yo por eso he querido moverme, a saber los resultados y luego me formulo lo algo como en este caso parece ser y vale subió si o malo tu plan llamado seguido porque son malos en este caso no se los que más. Odio decírtelo y luego que sepas que yo he llamado al hospital y me han dicho que a ti no te tomo porque va a haber resultados. 01:06:39:00 – 01:06:59:16 Desconocido Pueden quedar la doctora o el especialista, lo visito con la doctora para ver los estudios. ¿Bueno pero quien? ¿Acceso al estudio podremos? No podemos hablar un poco, explicar a ver que hacemos, que lo hacemos, que pasa que luego no pasa y cuando vas allí y claro te mandan visita no es lo que tu dices por la mañana no te mandan visitor. 01:06:59:19 – 01:07:46:18 Desconocido Entonces muchos que solo esperando y dos o por ejemplo cuando yo fui a la doctora Luke la noche anterior o así mi reloj y ese día había llevado simplemente un informe de lo que me habían hecho y no hemos hecho una biopsia de tanto un milímetro y dos, pero resultados. Y claro, todo eso lo olvidó. Lo demás y que hizo la biopsia que se realizó y eso fue a mi, a mi se me hizo la biopsia, entonces a mi no me dijo nada, no hubo auto, lo de cabeceo solamente me dijo lo mismo que me dijeron esos dos meses en diversos sitios que llamó y los que esperan a que te visite la especialista. 01:07:46:20 – 01:08:21:21 Desconocido Y así fue. Incluso cuando vas al doctor de las de cabecera o el cabecero me lo dijo. ¡Ánimo! Vale, te quedan 15 días para su visita, para saber bien los resultados de oportuno especialista. ¿Y no eran 15 días lo mucho mas no? ¿Pero bueno, ella dijo vivirías en el? Y dijo bueno, ciclo un poco. Y yo le dije no, perdón, no son diferidos, son equis días con lo que eran y em y si nueve, 19, 19 días, 18 que son nueve días, no eran 15 días. 01:08:21:23 – 01:08:45:06 Desconocido Y entonces yo le dije no son 15 días, son 19, 20 días y ya no son 19, incluidos los que llevo dos meses esperando en los que son 20 días, otros que van a ser dos meses y 19 o 20 días, te lo están diciendo como a modo de tranquilo, que ya llega el día. Ya dentro de poco estaba quitando el primogénito de encima. 01:08:45:06 – 01:09:33:29 Desconocido Yo me sentía muy mal y me levante. ¿Era del uno por uno la Universidad de Harvard, porque los que yo ya empezaba yo a o que ver con tus problemas, algo por respeto pero con su historial sin faltar al respeto y sin nada no? O esto yo, porque no soy así, pero si que yo iba a decir cosas y con respeto de lo que vio entonces pues prefirió levantarme, dejarlo como por la boca y y eso sin embargo ir allí y no Otura me dijo bueno, posiciones que plantea el especialista, yo no soy especialista que tú puedes acceder, tú sabes que llevo dos meses, dos años así, tu sabes que y mi situación económica ha 01:09:34:00 – 01:10:27:09 Desconocido ocurrido, los otros dos lo comentamos o eso y vamos a los problemas y los estudios social. Uno solo obtuvo lo que pidió, ayuda a los asuntos sociales, luego te encuentras de sustento social, no hay lujos, no veo como como un disfrute y uno esta hasta el divorcio. ¿Perdón que? Que tal como has dicho la asistencia social te pide ciertos documentos, incluso como comentabas en este momento, hace hace un tiempo atrás hasta el divorcio, sucedidos o introducción del divorcio de luego no lo volvió el custodia de los niños que en este caso decidí yo por el bien de los menores del niño, pues decidí que fue con los que fueron a un partido para que el 01:10:27:09 – 01:11:23:24 Desconocido pues ni no se le contara ni por el padre, ni por la madre, ni mejor ni peor, ni mucho menos, sino lo somos, no con partido y y todo medios y yo no, y luego y yo pues cuando sea grande pues tuvo a sus decisiones y eso fue mi decisión. Entonces la custodia y la sentenció en cosas porque por un mundo es igual, pero y yo puedo mostrar cosas y luego solo bien parado en su sentencia, pero las personas que son personas que no, y por ejemplo a mí se me acusó de un maltrato psicológico por el falsamente falso y yo cuando Duro denunció lo mío, mi abogado me presentó en comisaría y me dijeron 01:11:23:26 – 01:12:13:29 Desconocido mira al chico, esta persona lo atendí yo ayer y pintura que no me daba un motivo limpio y no me daba sustancia, concluyó porque naturalmente yo no lo vi. ¿Entonces yo dije en serio? Entonces esta persona los lo ha atendido ayer y tuve que decirle que me daba un motivo. Uno Julio uno lo denuncio y yo soy músico y y si otorgó juicio y se lo mostró omitiendo decir que no hay nada porque es que no hay nada, pero lo mancho esto y uno va a denunció, tienen que demostrarlo, demuestra que la saliva dando a manifestar entonces yo no tengo por que y mostrar de una a un actividades como por ejemplo yo ahora mi 01:12:13:29 – 01:12:50:09 Desconocido abogado cuando solicite lo familiar porque monto remedio no y lo damos primero si o si que unos gastos, la ayuda familiar y los otros cursos que también es muy difícil, pero los gastos no lo cambio productos los lo familiares de años tuvo su dinero de su madre con y para alquiler.

Cuatro y si puedo ahí porque es que no, es que yo no veo ninguna solida. Yo con la ayuda familiar lo pude ver y les robo y busco trabajo diariamente y me ocupo proporcionalmente pero no tengo proyectos, no me salen, estos no te llaman Lupe Bottle y no, y luego por la edad los ingresos del proyecto pues no tienen la oportunidad, no ven una oportunidad y tenemos la ayuda que tenemos los asunto mencionado, entonces como no borro como tales situaciones malos, esto es siempre oportunidades entre 01:16:49:21 – 01:17:30:11 Desconocido menos suerte, pero lo vamos a tomar mal si realmente lo que necesitamos ayuda y lo que me esta haciendo sufrir mucho porque es que a mí no me han dejado margen para tener una visión de me esta empezando por ejemplo, entonces los casos no tocar local como mucho ni los que ir peleando donde los que abriendo puertas son duros y luchando pero los como el destinados aquí aunque no es muy difícil, muy difícil Doctor ayudas y cosas es muy difícil, muy fácil. 01:17:30:15 – 01:17:54:25 Desconocido No en su con los que complicado si si es que lo ponen muy complicado te lo ponen muy difícil, te piden mucho documentos, documentación, los en dormirlos, bultos, luego al más mínimo despiste. Si, si se aprovechan de ello, pero no darle duro o puede negar tu. Bueno siempre es un siempre los que bueno si bueno al mínimo despiste o cualquier cosa lo aprovecho, me subo. 01:17:54:25 – 01:18:46:07 Desconocido No hablo de negarlo. De hecho creo que te piden tanto promoción y tanto por Pedro. Éxito en tu documentación. Son recursos para eso, para que lo tengas un poco más difícil y te canses o desistas y no pueda suceder por que te faltaba un documento de eso. Ya pasó el plazo. Luego Dios que aprobó un tipo de recurso, un titulado metrónomo, un curso asistido, es que estuvo muy estudioso, tuvo un alumno y la realidad los olvido, que yo con lo de ver que tengo cursos que pasan y tengo que ver otro ojo, tuvo un ojo y no es lo que uno como se me enseño tiene que aprender pasando los 18 meses que están estipulados 01:18:46:07 – 01:19:36:06 Desconocido y máximo de estar debajo no he tenido ningún resultado ni ningún y pude ayudar el sentido de lo que me paso de un diagnóstico no solución, lo pude evitar muy muy pronto y de lo nada se me ha dado lo alto, por eso busco lo que es. Voló porque vi sus monumentos, mis como trabajo y tendré que curar y tendré que vivir, tendré que pagar donde cuatro, o sea buscar un dinero que es tuyo, pero los Morgan y todos estos años trabajando llegas allí y un oficial te lo ha quitado por abrir todos los ocho meses de que baja un doctor representa que caro la vas a me la he pagado yo entonces no los 01:19:36:07 – 01:19:59:13 Desconocido que estos religiosos. No te queda otra solución. Usted tiene mucho trabajo. En mi caso pido que me pasó un contrato, me vi obligado por un novio, propuso curso para acabar volvió a tener que pedir ayuda, cosa que no puse la juventud que pidió plata porque nomás no me ayudo para no, y lo familiar no me sirvió para nada y pude. 01:19:59:14 – 01:20:55:05 Desconocido Por lo menos tuve miedo, no, pero he vivido ayudas, no quiero que se me olvide, quiero que me den un diagnostico, quiero que me vean. No son plum el tubito me mostraron por que no puedo trabajar que me toco uno incluido su porque conozco y no quiero que me paguen por ello plus sino que como su minusvalía. Botón rojo doctor un poco mi situación y los que si no podemos trabajar no nos damos opción y no entro, mostré video, entrevistas y no hay ayudas donde vamos, donde vamos y hay me imagino las personas mayores siempre se dicen que tienen pensiones irrisorios y son totalmente solos y yo no mucho no, porque al menos no como 01:20:55:06 – 01:21:39:19 Desconocido ellos, pero cuando vivimos a mayores y luego cuando somos como como sólidos productivos, lo que nosotros en su momento claro, es más una situación y según están las cosas van a peor, pero siempre seguimos o estamos viendo que cada día como vamos mejorando muchísimo más, no quiero decir ver trabajo por turno, autobús, los pisos están muy asequibles. ¿Bueno, ibas todo tirado por se cumplió supermercado y bueno, no hace falta, miro nada, pero a oportunidades no te compro los tres y sabemos nuestro propósito no? 01:21:39:21 – 01:22:23:14 Desconocido Y estoy hablando, estoy hablando jocosamente. Lo que decir por estudios donde el tutor es total. Totalmente cierto. Y bueno, pues esperamos que todo tenga una una solución y sobre todo que este espacio de cabida a un poco de visibilidad no a lo que pasas tú y en general las personas a nivel laboral, a nivel médico y que desde aquí dando la mayor visibilidad posible dentro de este punto de vista, no a nivel laboral, sanitario, podríamos decir, en este caso pueda ser escuchado. 01:22:23:14 – 01:23:03:29 Desconocido ¿Hay muchas personas que que directamente estén en la misma situación que tu, pues como decías antes, que haya mucha bulla, que haya mucho movimiento para que esas reformas laborales que se interpusieron en el pasado vuelvan a ser unas reformas laborales en las cuales no solamente se beneficie el empresario o directamente la sanidad, sino que se beneficie también los los afectados en que las pagas, por ejemplo en este caso que sean un poco más grandes a como son en este momento, no? 01:23:04:03 – 01:23:40:01 Desconocido Porque por ejemplo, una persona lo mejor que ha estado trabajando cinco años con un sueldo de 800 € tenga o pues una paga a través del paro de unos 400 o 500 € que con 400 o 500 € con la vida que tenemos pues no es total. Y luego igual que tu a lo mejor tienes cotizados 30 años por ejemplo y solo te cuentan los los seis últimos trabajos que hayas tenido los seis últimos meses resultó que tu es lo que dormí también y lo otro y todo. 01:23:40:04 – 01:24:10:22 Desconocido Ahora si que salió una nueva ley que de cada jubilación con tu trabajo a media jornada, tu cuenta a jornada completa, pero de cara a la jubilación o duro la ley no lo sé, solo efectivo. No lo sé en ese sentido. Pues es muy costoso, sí, pero también mucho. En muchos otros casos no me beneficio. Tienen un contrato de media jornada porque lo solo tuyo no que un contrato de medio fondo y un sueldo en la jornada. 01:24:10:24 – 01:24:43:05 Desconocido ¿Yo no quiero tener una ayuda familiar irrisorio ni irrisorio ni nueve y sólo lo quiero un trabajo y no solucionable a que es mi orientación saber que paso y que solución le podemos dar y tener una vida normal, que la vida se tuerce y a veces no como yo no vivo normal, pues que sus cosas que pasan somos seres humanos y entonces vernos solución y si no es solución pues buscar no como ayudar para que esa persona pueda subsistir, no? 01:24:43:07 – 01:25:31:09 Desconocido Ya nos dijo que solo de vacaciones y no que subsistir, no atender sus cosas, que o atender su comida y por ende su su día a día. Y es que lo veo totalmente injusto. Bueno en el mundo es solamente unos pocos y todos es únicamente unos pocos, que no somos nada como lo que vivimos, otros no somos nada porque yo creo que yo vivo como un león, por eso decidí cubrir maestros propio con vosotros, porque lo que debería ser muy importante y lo lo y lo comió el durante un día en lo que realmente paso y lo que realmente son las cosas, porque lo lo propio, los que no soy el único y pudo hablar, 01:25:31:15 – 01:26:07:13 Desconocido pudo ver un poco los monos, como mover un poco las piernas, pero es un ritmo y gusto propio. Yo intoxicacion y eso es lo que debemos evitar, pues es lo que debemos evitar, pues es justo y santo y que se aprovechó mucho y se mucho y los pocos ayudas que pudo subió grande porque sus compañeros pues se nos acaba el tiempo Carlos V Un placer estar con contigo en este primer punto de vista tipo podcast, porque ya sabemos que lo hacemos en directo a través de otra plataforma. 01:26:07:15 – 01:26:38:05 Desconocido Ha sido un verdadero placer y bueno, que todo vaya bien y ya nos sigas contando como va la situación. Por supuesto somos nosotros y no todos, pues ahí estaba el testimonio de Carlos y ha sido bastante desgarrador. Nosotros nos marchamos, perdón, que ha empezado la cabecera antes de tiempo, nos marchamos y la semana que viene estamos nuevamente con todos ustedes en el punto de mesa. 01:26:38:09 – 01:26:54:19 Desconocido Hasta pronto.","completion":"Lamento la confusión, pero parece que ha habido un error.

Un nuevo programa en este caso. Pues vamos a hablar sobre los desafíos actuales de la inspección médica en España, la necesidad de las reformas urgentes para garantizar una salud mejor. En los últimos tiempos se ha observado un preocupante aumento en los problemas que enfrentan los pacientes en relación con la inspección médica en España. 00:00:40:11 - 00:01:09:02 Desconocido Entre las quejas más frecuentes se encuentran la falta de comunicación por y previa alta y el bloqueo de bajas, incluso casos que pueden ser permanentes. Estos problemas han afectado a numerosos pacientes, generando la urgente necesidad de dar visibilidad a estas situaciones y abogar por reformas que mejoren el sistema de salud. Como decíamos, uno de los problemas más destacados es la falta de comunicación previa al dar de alta a los pacientes. 00:01:09:04 - 00:01:32:13 Desconocido Muchos individuos han informado que de repente se les da de alta sin previo aviso, dejándolos desconcertados y sin la oportunidad de discutir su situación médica con los profesionales de la salud. Esta falta de transparencia crea un ambiente de incertidumbre y desconfianza entre los pacientes y el sistema de salud. Otro aspecto muy preocupante es el bloqueo de bajas médicas. 00:01:32:13 - 00:02:04:06 Desconocido Incluso en situaciones donde la condición de los pacientes es permanente. Algunas personas han experimentado dificultades para obtener bajas médicas adecuadas, lo que afecta directamente a su calidad de vida la capacidad para acceder a los servicios sanitarios. Y este problema no solo impacta en la atención médica, sino que también tiene consecuencias económicas y sociales significativas para los afectados. Es fundamental que casos de pacientes afectados por estos problemas se den a conocer públicamente la visibilidad de estas situaciones. 00:02:04:06 - 00:02:33:05 Desconocido Pueden generar conciencia sobre las deficiencias entre el sistema de inspección médica en España. Las redes sociales, los medios de comunicación y otras plataformas pueden ser herramientas efectivas para compartir experiencias y presionar los cambios positivos. Además, es crucial abogar por reformas en el sistema de salud. El código abierto entre los pacientes y los profesionales de la salud y las autoridades gubernamentales es esencial para identificar y abordar los problemas subyacentes. 00:02:33:05 - 00:03:02:10 Desconocido Se necesita un compromiso activo por parte del gobierno para realizar y mejorar los procedimientos de inspección médica, asegurando que se respeten los derechos y necesidades de los pacientes. Hoy, en el punto de vista, tenemos a Mariángeles, a la que le damos la bienvenida. ¿Cómo estás, Mariángeles? Bien, dentro de lo que cabe. Bien. Muchísimas gracias.

Bueno, o no sé como decirlo, no de cara a la. 00:07:46:27 - 00:08:18:04 Desconocido Todo lo que sea trabajo es bueno, o sea, limpiar, sea lo que sea, sea lo que sea, igual de digno, pero las personas pues como que lo vemos con algo distinto. Bueno, pues yo te voy a etiquetar exactamente, pero yo ya te digo, estoy todo el día con una fregona y yo estoy ahora mismo de baja. ¿ER Porque que en cuestión de de dos meses lo que llevo más o menos de baja, yo me he caído tres veces en la calle, vale? 00:08:18:07 - 00:08:41:10 Desconocido ¿Las tres veces he caído sobre el lado derecho y lo que yo tengo mal es el hombro ahora mismo, vale? Er Aparte de lo que ya tengo el hombro derecho, el codo, la muñeca y el hombro, yo el brazo no lo puedo levantar. ¿El pero eh, ella a cuando el de ayer me dice no, es que no quiere levantarlo? 00:08:41:10 - 00:09:11:15 Desconocido No señora, es que cuando lo levanto de aquí me duele. ¿Yo no puedo hacerte esto, Ojo, ella me lo estuvo manipulando, vale? No me hizo daño como me ha hecho otras veces cuando me detectó ayer y vuelvo a repetir que estuvo más correcta, pero sí que me advirtió que bueno, que llevaba muchos días y que me daría la próxima vez que me citase, me daría la. 00:09:11:17 - 00:09:39:06 Desconocido La patología que tú tienes, por ejemplo, en este caso con el tema de ocio, sí podríamos llamarlo, que es lo que te dice el médico de cabecera, o el rehabilitador o el especialista en En general, el rehabilitador todavía no me ha visto porque no me han mandado. El traumatólogo me ha dicho la primera cita tenía que haber, eh. 00:09:39:09 - 00:10:08:02 Desconocido Me ha mandado un eh, pero me la daban para el 22 de marzo. Me llamó la Mutua. La Mutua me dijo que si yo estaba de acuerdo en que me la hiciesen ellos y yo le he dicho que sí y está y el informe de la mutua, que lo tengo, pero vale. ¿Una cosa que yo no entiendo, por ejemplo, es el tema de que si todavía no te ha visto un rehabilitador, como te puede decir que te va a dar de alta directamente? 00:10:08:04 - 00:10:42:15 Desconocido Claro, ella me dijo que como tenía que ir el día 8 al médico de cabecera, que intentase yo por todos los medios, no que el rehabilitador me viese ante y le dije eso lo tiene más fácil, usted mándelo. ¿En cuanto a mi me más o menos directamente con las listas de espera tan largas que hay, no? Y claro, si ella tiene la capacidad para darme a mí el alta también tiene la capacidad para mandarme a un rehabilitador para que yo estoy en rehabilitación el el lunes o el martes. 00:10:42:15 - 00:11:09:27 Desconocido El miércoles si nada capacidad ninguna entiende. ¿Entonces? Er. Me dijo que no, que ya ella no podía mandar. ¿Sigo como que no, eh? ¿Bueno, yo vamos a ver aquí lo que es lo que interés entre comillas es que yo me ponga a trabajar no? O mándame un rehabilitador cuanto antes. ¿Lo que tengo en el hombro es que va a curarse, eh? 00:11:10:01 - 00:11:41:24 Desconocido Pues a lo mejor no, pues porque él forma parte del resto de las patologías que yo tengo ahora. Se me ha agravado más por la caída, pero que puedo mejorarlo. Pues sí, puedo hacer una vida entre comillas más normal, pues también, pero mándame a un rehabilitador. Pero, pero incluso puede ser que tú misma te padeces ese rehabilitador. Sí, bueno, pero yo económicamente ya no me lo puedo pagar. 00:11:41:27 - 00:11:57:05 Desconocido Ya, claro. Vamos a ver. Er. Yo actualmente. Actualmente. Vale, yo tengo un 65% de discapacidad reconocida. ¿Vale? 00:11:57:08 - 00:12:35:14 Desconocido Ya estoy trabajando, ya exactamente con un 65. Er. Yo podía pedir una jubilación. Vale. Sí, legalmente, sí. Pero claro, porque estoy aguantando. Pues porque económicamente entonces yo no podría vivir. Pues yo tengo dos hijas menores y todo lo que conlleva lo demás. Entonces las personas que estamos así no podemos hacer otra cosa, Tenemos que seguir aguantando. ¿Y referente a tus patologías, ahora estando de baja, cómo afecta esto a lo que es tu salud mental? 00:12:35:14 - 00:13:00:03 Desconocido ¿Directamente? ¿Eh Bueno, pues mira mi salud mental el lunes este pasado a mí me me dio una subida de tensión, eh? Que por eso tengo el ojo como lo tengo, porque la la arterial. Te voy a decir cuánto tenía de baja benigna tenía 12 menos. No te voy a contar cuánto tenía de alta. Vale, me lo puedo imaginar. 00:13:00:05 - 00:13:33:12 Desconocido Er. Yo he tenido. ¿Tu te acuerdas de la serie B? Sí, de la de los lagartos. Pues el ojo izquierdo parecía el de un lagarto. ¿Como ha estado todo con derrame? Como un derrame a lo bestia. De hecho, que ayer me vio otra vez el mismo logo. ¿Porque eso sí, habiendo en el hospital en cuanto yo he ido a urgencias con él porque tengo diabetes, entonces la diabetes afecta también a la vista, afecta a todo a cornea, afecta a nervio óptico, os afecta la retina? 00:13:33:15 - 00:13:58:07 Desconocido Tengo una pequeña úlcera, pero bueno, ayer ya me dijo la alumna que dentro de lo malo que no había perdido mucha audición y que bueno que lo que había sido, que todo iba a recuperarlo, vale. Pero claro, eso afecta a atención a atención ocular, afecta a diabetes, que el azúcar está para arriba y para abajo, para dentro y para afuera y para todos lados. 00:13:58:09 - 00:14:30:10 Desconocido Y dice pues no coma así señora, es que no, como es que he tengo. ¿Para que te hagas una idea, asociamos la diabetes o asocian la diabetes con el sobrepeso? Si ya yo peso 58 kilos, pero es que la diabetes es una enfermedad que sale así por así da igual el sobrepeso. Sí que es verdad que en personas que tienes sobrepeso no le ocurre, pero pero realmente vamos, yo no te veo con sobrepeso. 00:14:30:12 - 00:14:58:02 Desconocido Bueno, pues claro, eso también me provoca que eh. Bueno, ya me imagino mi mochila porque tengo que llamar al neurocirujano. El neurocirujano ve en Toledo, tengo que ir a Toledo a que me vean, porque yo el cataplasma que tengo en la cabeza es pasivo. Está asqueroso. ¿Que tienes en la cabeza? ¿Perdón? Nunca verlo más. Nunca ver nada. Sí, un cavernícola. 00:14:58:03 - 00:15:22:19 Desconocido Y lo tengo. Y según me dijeron la última vez, hombre, está controlado, pero está activo. ¿Qué quiere decir eso? Bueno, que a mí me puede dar lo mismo, que el derrame Me ha salido la vista como mi. Exactamente. Pues me puede dar en la cabeza ese derrame. Entonces lo tienen que estar controlando. A mí me están controlando. He comido en neurocirugía. 00:15:22:22 - 00:15:53:27 Desconocido Vale, pero en este caso con. Con el problema que tenemos en la cabeza. Aparte de los problemas óseos y todo lo que estás contando, no puedes trabajar porque ya directamente estando estando, por ejemplo, sola No, porque la mayor parte de las personas que trabajan en limpieza no lo hacen, no lo hacen grupal. Entonces te puede dar un jamacuco por llamarlo de alguna forma y quedarte ahí en el sitio, por ejemplo. 00:15:54:00 - 00:16:24:21 Desconocido Sí, pero entonces, como esta señora que me imagino que tendrá ese informe, puede, puede decirte que te des prisa, que te voy a dar de alta. Pues así me lo dijo ayer. ¿Entonces cuando yo salí estaba mi marido esperándome fuera y había dos personas, dos o tres personas que habían salido delante de mí, que dice mi marido qué te ha dicho? 00:16:24:23 - 00:16:48:10 Desconocido Digo nada, me ha dicho que de momento se de baja, pero dice es que si no íbamos a poner una reclamación a mismo porque han salido tres delante de ti que están poniendo reclamaciones. Yo tenía claro ayer que si a mí me daba el alta, aparte de la reclamación que yo quería, pudiese tener edificio. Yo me iba a bajar al juzgado a denunciar. 00:16:48:12 - 00:17:08:15 Desconocido Y es que si no nos bajamos, denunciamos y con todos los informes que tenemos médicos no hacemos nada. O sea, a mí de nada me vale estar quejándome de aquí o está quejándome en redes sociales o en cualquier otro sitio. Si yo no doy la cara y lo hago por mí y no es por mí, ya es para mí. 00:17:08:17 - 00:17:42:21 Desconocido Y digo mira, esta situación está pasando y conmigo a lo mejor, bueno, a veces una denuncia no va a ningún sitio, pero una denuncia otra, otra y así. Y a esto darle visibilidad. Pues sí, que alguien tiene que perder, entre comillas. ¿Perder, no? ¿Sí, claro que tenemos que arriesgar también que tenemos que escondernos, no? Porque la mayoría de nosotros tenemos todo un informe para escribir y cuatro biblias y no nos están haciendo caso. 00:17:42:24 - 00:18:04:03 Desconocido ¿Vale? Y vas al médico y te piden ahí es que es depresión mía. No, perdona, yo cuando fui el lunes con el ojo que no lo tenía y yo le decía, yo decía al médico que me atendió mira si será por mi estado emocional, pero no tengo depresión, no tengo ansiedad, a mí no me debe una pastillita para anularme, porque no es eso lo que tengo. 00:18:04:03 - 00:18:25:19 Desconocido ¿O sea, yo necesito ir algo, algo real, algo que a mí me solucione, que me solucione mi día a día porque es que no me lo va a solucionar nadie, entiendes? Entonces hay que darle visibilidad, claro, pero cada uno tenemos que aportar nuestro granito de arena, lo que no podemos decir a la que lo haga el otro por mi nombre. 00:18:25:22 - 00:18:48:29 Desconocido Esto no funciona así, pues ya así porque, porque si no nos tenemos que dar cuenta que tenemos que estar todos en el mismo es y estamos todos en el mismo barco, igual que yo estoy aquí hablándolo. Ay si yo tengo alguna conocida que por ejemplo el otro día en las redes sociales en Facebook es que hay muchos suicidios. 00:18:48:29 - 00:19:22:17 Desconocido Claro que hay muchos sentido cuando la gente y a eso no se le da tampoco visibilidad. Vale, cuando la gente no sabe qué hacer, cuando la gente se enfrenta a estos profesionales que bueno, entre comillas también lo de profesionales vale que no tienen la más mínima empatía, que no saben la situación de cada persona y ya no tienen obligación de saberlo, pero por lo menos que los escuchen, porque hay muchas personas que necesitan ser madre y eso tampoco lo están haciendo. 00:19:22:24 - 00:19:51:05 Desconocido Si tú no te sientes escuchada en ningún momento, con lo que con lo que ha ocurrido. Y referente a al autorices se te ha pasado por la cabeza también el tema del ataque. Si no, pero no te ha causado ningún tipo de depresión estas patologías que tienes. Sí, en otro momento sí, vale. ¿ER Cómo he suplido yo esto, eh? 00:19:51:06 - 00:20:12:11 Desconocido Pues mira, y leyendo mucho y estudiando mucho y pensando que si yo en un momento determinado y aquí estoy, que tengo que estar, por más que intente quitarme del medio, hasta que no me llegue la hora, no lo voy a conseguir. Vamos a ver. 00:20:12:13 - 00:20:40:11 Desconocido Vale, totalmente de lógica, pero. Pero sí que es verdad que de hecho yo me puse a estudiar, a estudiar, Valero, a informarme como queráis llamarlo, a ser autoridad, ya vale, porque al fin y al cabo yo he aprendido mucho en este tiempo, porque con coge el problema, fíjate, ya tenía en la cabeza. Yo iba perdiendo, perdiendo la forma de expresarme, iba perdiendo vocabulario. 00:20:40:13 - 00:21:09:06 Desconocido Eh, se me olvidaba. Y bueno, olvidos tenemos, claro, sí, pero había cosas muy puntuales. ¿Estábamos llegando y bueno, un tipo de anestesia eh, yo dónde es que no sé cómo definirlo? Vale, yo donde tengo la lesión en el 40, el izquierdo en el área de Enrique, según me explicó el médico, pero lo tengo en la intersección del área de Broca y de Bonito. 00:21:09:09 - 00:21:41:06 Desconocido O sea, eh, para que tú veas hasta donde llega mi lesión, yo tenía que ser muda, según los médicos. Sí, sí, sí, sí. Y según los médicos yo tenía que haber dejado de hablar. Sí que es cierto que en un momento determinado y yo pierdo esa facilidad, pero bueno, sí, gracias a Dios y al esfuerzo mío estoy que bueno, realmente eso es. 00:21:41:08 - 00:22:09:03 Desconocido Podríamos catalogarlo como un milagro que se te pueda escuchar la voz. A mí me quitan la voz y yo me muero ya directamente porque estoy yo sola. Yo hubiese tenido que aprender el lenguaje de signos y así, entre otras patologías que tengo yo, yo soy totalmente es sorda por el oído izquierdo. Además del accidente que tuve y el oído y el oído derecho lo tengo a muy poquita. 00:22:09:05 - 00:22:13:18 Desconocido ¿Oigo lo justito para pasa el día, vale? 00:22:13:21 - 00:22:37:09 Desconocido ¿Pero sin embargo, ahora con todo esto y golpes que yo he tenido, porque a mí el último golpe fue más escandaloso, pero me recogieron en la calle, tuvo que venir ambulancia, tuvo que salió todo con la gente de una farmacia en Guadalajara, vale? Y yo a mi hija, una de ellas sí, pero mamá, levántate, mamá, está bien, levántate. 00:22:37:09 - 00:23:03:09 Desconocido Y yo no me podía levantar del suelo hasta que al final me empecé a recuperar y me bueno, con ayuda ya me levanté y ya pues me puse mejor, pero no sé por lo que he hecho y eso es lo que yo quiero. Ahora que le diga mira si eso te está pasando, porque realmente que está volviendo a dar problemas de cáncer o a son vértigos del oído, porque también pueden ser vértigos del oído, puesto que yo lo hice. 00:23:03:14 - 00:23:41:07 Desconocido ¿Por ejemplo, tuviste un síncope? Si me caí, sí, yo no sé si porque cuando yo me di cuenta yo ya estaba en el suelo. ¿Entonces no te puedo decir qué es lo que me pasó, sabes? Y claro, el miedo hizo miedo. ¿Vamos a ver, me da miedo ir a la por la calle en día, vale? Porque yo salgo y hay días que ahora que estoy de baja, que no, que me agobio en casa porque a mi me encanta en casa, pero hay veces que tengo la suerte y me anda y decir bueno, como tengo que ir un poquito alto la ceja, voy a andar. 00:23:41:08 - 00:24:19:29 Desconocido Si se me baja de estar controlándote todo el tiempo. Claro, si yo fuese otra persona yo no hubiese salido de mi casa, pero puedo asegurar, porque hay veces que según por dónde vaya y mira eh, yo vivo en la ladera entre Alovera y Azuqueca hay un puente por encima. Es como si la carretera pasa por debajo o en otros tiempos ya era subir ese puente y ponerme malísima, malísima de tenerme que echar a gatas para hacer subir el puente del vértigo. 00:24:19:29 - 00:24:54:01 Desconocido Caminaba, Sí, sí, porque se me movía el puente. Yo decía que se me movía el puente y eso era del vértigo. Eso me explicaron que no sé si será del vértigo, no, pero lo tendría yo muy claro. ¿Realmente no creo que a raíz de un vértigo por subir un puente, no? Ahora. Bueno, pues hay veces que cuando voy acompañada me agarro a la persona que que vaya y si no pues me agarro a la pasarela, pero se lo paso saber porque no me puedo. 00:24:54:01 - 00:25:33:27 Desconocido Es que no, no, no, no podemos quedar ahí, no es lo más lógico. Y el conducir me imagino que tampoco. Yo a día de hoy con mucha precaución, pero no está. ¿Cuidado que me pueda pasar algo cosa es que el problema es que va a pasar algo directamente no subo aquí al al que venga conmigo, porque cómo te mueves de un sitio a otro? 00:25:33:29 - 00:26:25:14 Desconocido Claro, y ahora que ahora que estás en casa directamente sí. Y como, como, como que te sientes a nivel anímico. Porque he entrevistado a muchas personas, no en cuestiones de de esto y lo que tú decías pensaba mucho en la autolesiones y en algunas ocasiones se sentían solas. Pues mira, esta, esta mañana mismamente en dices que no valgo para nada, pero no vale para nada, porque por incapacitada de hacer ciertas tareas sí, porque tenéis limitada de determinada e. 00:26:25:16 - 00:26:59:06 Desconocido Si levantas la cabeza y yo levanta así la cabeza y es como y si la bajo hacia suelo ahí mismamente en cuanto en el hospital le decía a la almohada es que parece que estoy en la noria porque miro hacia el suelo, pongo la cabeza de acá abajo y me da todo vueltas y eso ya me imagino que la semana que sin darte cuenta el problema que tienes en cómo te y no se sabe y ese problema de la cabeza no tiene ningún tipo de solución. 00:26:59:06 - 00:27:47:07 Desconocido Se que dentro de lo que es el cerebro no, pero hay alguna intervención quirúrgica. E En un principio cuando empezaron a tratarme hace no sé, siete, ocho años aproximadamente e el neurólogo de aquí de Guadalajara, el que me veía porque yo tenía bueno, cada vez que iba el hombre es como que vamos a dejarlo ahí. Empatía cero con los pacientes y me mandó a mandó a Toledo precisamente por eso, a medias, pero sale para que el neurocirujano lo valorase para operarme, pero en ese momento el neurocirujano lo valoró dentro de lo malo. 00:27:47:10 - 00:28:33:09 Desconocido Bueno, a mí me dijo en la operación que a mi me tenían que hacer y de momento como está estable o por lo menos hasta el día de hoy ha estado más o menos estable. Pues me ven cara a cara año cada seis meses me veían antes, ahora ya me casa, ya entiendes, había pensado. A ver, vamos a ver, dentro de lo que es la estabilidad de de este problema, tendrían que buscar un tipo de solución, porque eso, esos micro micro infartos directamente que afectan a lo que es tu salud, también puede afectar a diferentes cosas y esto puede crecer incluso y convertirse en algo peor. 00:28:33:11 - 00:29:06:09 Desconocido Es de hecho a mi al principio me very me veían cada seis meses porque era como que si había sangraba y se veía en las falsificaciones de haber, ya sabes, como en los escáner, en las tablas o resonancia, como quieras decirlo. También así le hacían, se veía por dónde había sangrado y donde había quedado plastificado. Y ahí en la parte que está clasificada, pero hay otra parte, se activa y entonces esa parte activa pues no sé. 00:29:06:14 - 00:29:23:20 Desconocido Por lo que yo tengo que tener cuidado, contención se puede. Tengo que tener cuidado con aceptar, tengo que tener cuidado con una serie de cosas que bueno que es un día a día, pero vale. A ver, a ver, yo lo que no entiendo es que no te hagan una valoración directamente, o sea, dentro de lo que es la valoración. 00:29:23:22 - 00:29:55:19 Desconocido Ya centrándonos un poco más en lo que es la inspección médica, que que no te lo tomen en serio. Sí, pero fíjate, ella me, eh, ella y él lo que me dijo inspección médica ayer, que yo ahora mismo estoy de baja por el brazo, que ella las demás no las tiene en cuenta, pero es que no es un brazo, o sea, el brazo es lo que a surgido de tres entre comillas tres golpes que me he dado yo seguidos en la calle. 00:29:55:22 - 00:30:25:04 Desconocido ¿Me entiende? Ha ido tres veces en la calle y el brazo es, por así decirlo, la parte visible. ¿Pero yo lo que quiero es que vea la parte que no ve nadie, o sea, la parte invisible dentro de mi patología, que con esto no me estoy haciendo la víctima para nada, eh? Dentro de mi fatal logía, que vean por qué he tenido tres golpes seguida, si han sido subida de tensión, si ha sido porque el cabeza no manejando otra vez problema, si ha sido yo qué sé. 00:30:25:06 - 00:30:59:13 Desconocido Que lo investiguen, señores, porque, eh, no es que está de baja por el brazo. Pues sí, claro que estoy de baja porque me más difícil, pero lo demás Ya, pero directamente estar de baja por por el brazo, que eso te lo ha podido producir lo que es el no mano para, para, para los que no sé. ¿Y los vértigos también el problema, pero es ese problema de los oídos, lo tienes de siempre o lo tienes desde que se detectó los lo que es el Noma? 00:30:59:15 - 00:31:51:12 Desconocido ¿Yo tuve tuve un accidente, tuve un accidente de tráfico, vale? Er. Y así. Y lo primero que a mí me detectan en exactamente tráfico fue en el 2013. Sale Lo primero que yo noto es la adicción de mi. ER Bueno, pues en cuanto a mi me quiere ver el otorrino, habían pasado cuatro meses del accidente, entonces en el foro otorrino, mira podíamos haberlo salvado, pues no lo sabemos porque en ese momento el ya simplemente a simple vista del accidente ya se sabe y fue el mismo otorrino cuando a mí me me ven el el oído como tenía el oído, como estaba todo el otorrino fue el que era una mancha en el parental izquierdo y 00:31:51:12 - 00:32:20:03 Desconocido ¿me dijo mira yo aquí no se si es si tienes lo tienes, pero yo te voy a mandar al neurólogo y quería mandar o a que te hagan y que te investiguen más eh? ¿Y le mando y el neurólogo a cuando? ¿Cuando a mi me ve ya se encuentra con todas las pruebas porque la había mandado al otorrino y fue ahí donde lo que es no diciendo en este caso de que te salía una mancha, no? 00:32:20:05 - 00:32:48:03 Desconocido ¿Que eso podría ser lo que son las hemorragias, no? Que es una de las complicaciones más preocupantes de lo que son los cavernosas y que son, como digo, las hemorragias. Entonces sí, sí, sí, la caverna, por decirlo ya médicamente hablando, se rompe o sangra o puede provocar síntomas agudos y casos graves. Y ahora un accidente cerebrovascular, que es lo que estábamos hablando anteriormente. 00:32:48:06 - 00:33:28:23 Desconocido Sí, exactamente. Pueden producirse. De hecho. De hecho, la primera vez que a mí me ve el neurólogo aquí en Guadalajara, me dijo mire, esta señora le puede dar desde un ictus o un derrame cerebral. Digo, como bien, y ahí se quedó, No, no dejó más nada, no, mira, si bueno, yo arremetí porque er de aquel día venía un hijo pequeño, mayor, pero la familia es como moreno, muy moreno y se puso a hablar y yo lo miré a él porque le cambió la cara de color y yo lo miré a él y le dije pues mire, yo también. 00:33:28:25 - 00:34:09:29 Desconocido Y el hombre insistía, digo sí, sí, mira, la única diferencia es que se me está estudiando en mi cabeza y yo no estoy estudiando el asunto y me y pero desde ahí el señor pues como que bueno, porque cada vez que iba a su consulta ibas, había tira y afloja por ese tema. A ver, yo es que con este tema directamente hay varios tipos que son los y dependiendo también de varios factores como como es la ubicación o el tamaño o no sé poner nomás el tamaño o el tamaño mínimo no te puede decir los milímetros porque ahora mismo no tengo el informe aquí delante. 00:34:10:06 - 00:34:35:09 Desconocido ¿Vale, pero es más o menos como una lenteja castellana, no las lentejas pardina, la castellana que es más grande pues, y dice bueno, no es muy grande, bueno, no es muy grande si te coge un brazo, pero es el cerebro, pues tiene su tiene su vaya ya, pero bueno, por lo que estás contando es una sintomatología grave, no? 00:34:35:12 - 00:35:06:18 Desconocido Sí, yo creo que debería considerarse también hacer una cirugía y extirpar lo que es el el cáncer, no más Cierto, lo que pasa que está. ¿La cirugía está en la cabeza, eh? Son peligro. Bueno, muy peligrosa de hecho, a mí me la explicó en su día el neurocirujano. Vale, a mí se me duermen para cortar el hueso de la cabeza, pero una vez que tengan el cerebro abierto, a mí me tienen que ir, por así decirlo, a despertar. 00:35:06:18 - 00:35:30:28 Desconocido Para ellos estar interactuando conmigo. Van a así en España han hecho alguna cirugía de España y he visto alguna que otra. Duermen como como tú dices, te abren la cabeza y van con unas pinzas tocando para ver lo que te sientes. Pero la persona tiene que estar consciente de ello, o sea, tiene que estar despierta, por así decirlo. 00:35:31:00 - 00:35:55:08 Desconocido Vamos a ver, yo y no soy miedosa, vale, pero yo me pongo en situación Vas a alguien lista y te están hurgando una muela y a mí y a mí me da los siete males. Pues fíjate, no sé, no lo sé. A lo mejor sí me lo tienen que hacer en una última instancia, porque sería vida o muerte. 00:35:55:08 - 00:36:20:21 Desconocido Pues mira, que sea lo que Dios quiera, pero entrar en un quirófano bueno, pues no lo sé. Entonces el neurocirujano está es cada vez que voy a Samos, ahí, ahí plantean ndolo. Bueno, esto va bien, es vamos a seguir así, vamos a seguir de la otra manera. ¿Pero sí, en Toledo la verdad que estoy muy bien, pero eso a que Guadalajara? 00:36:20:23 - 00:36:59:10 Desconocido ¿Ojo que hay médicos muy profesionales en Guadalajara y para quitarse el sombrero, pero pa que es una de esos? ¿Tú crees que la vocación médica ha desaparecido y ya no es como antes, como antiguamente el hecho de tratar mejor en Toledo porque es la central, no? Yo pienso que es cuestión de personal médico e ir al médico que bueno, pues a lo mejor tiene muchos pacientes, pero eso es su pasión, la medicina y eso se nota. 00:36:59:12 - 00:37:33:27 Desconocido ¿Vale, mira, yo tengo el médico que tengo de cabecera, bueno, voy a dar nombre, vale? Er a mí me gusta. Es un señor ya muy mayor y ayer y concretamente con la doctora o con el espectro o como quieras llamar, dije es que mi médico, eh, se va a jubilar y coge y me dice sí, pero no tengas, porque se ha aplazado ya su jubilación dos veces. 00:37:33:29 - 00:37:57:03 Desconocido O sea que no te de pena. Y dije yo después digo si a mí no me da pena. O sea, vamos a ver, tienes ya 70 años y aplazar la jubilación. Bueno, pues aunque tengas 70 años y ese señor es un profesional y ese señor sí está ahí y cuando vamos nos intenta dar los mejores resultados para para nosotros es posible. 00:37:57:06 - 00:38:20:04 Desconocido Por qué no vas a, por qué te lo vas a quitar del medio con cada junta no hay médicos que va y según que sea bueno, pues te tratan de esa manera. Es como que bueno, esto es lo que hay, vive con eso. Bueno, pero si tú eres un profesional de la medicina, se supone que estás ahí para salvar vidas, no para quitarlas del medio. 00:38:20:06 - 00:38:47:05 Desconocido Para eso ya nos quitamos nosotros y nos tenemos que quitar en algún momento determinado, pero tú no podemos menos. ¿No, no, no, por Dios, pero tú estás ahí para salvar vidas, o sea, a costa de lo que sea, y si no, no te dedicas y esta gente está en seria impostores, pues deberían dejar para sí, no? Porque ojo que nadie dice que mañana no le vaya a pasar a ellos. 00:38:47:07 - 00:39:13:10 Desconocido Y si le pasa, bueno, pues lo que eso te habla ahora, tanto la gente del karma como pero realmente lo del tema del karma sí que se debería de aplicar y debería de existir, no como como se suele decir y has dado en un punto clave en el que dices si les pasa a ellos lo mismo. ¿Tú crees que alguno de ellos les habrá pasado algo? 00:39:13:17 - 00:39:47:17 Desconocido ¿Algo similar? ¿Eh? No, si les hubiese pasado. Y realmente se acerca, no a ellos, sino a su alrededor, a esos seres queridos que muchas veces que haya es que en los cuales no, a veces no nos duelen más esos seres queridos que lo que nos ocurre a nosotros pero lo mismo a lo mejor es como como una dictadura, no como 1/5 mundo, por ejemplo, que esto que fusila a cualquiera con tal de ganarse un incentivo es bueno. 00:39:47:21 - 00:40:15:13 Desconocido O sea que me gustaría acertar si tú crees que reciben incentivos por dar de alta a las personas. Y está claro, mira, esto es como la Guardia Civil en la carretera hay fecha puntuales. Ojo, no me estoy metiendo con la Guardia Civil, vale, hacen trabajo bueno, pero hay fechas puntuales que aparecen en todos sitios y todas las multas que caen, ya sea porque el día por es porque tienen que sacar multas para sacar dinero, ya está. 00:40:15:16 - 00:40:42:03 Desconocido Yo entiendo, vale, es Arcas más o menos. Y hubo una época. Además, fíjate, yo te voy a hablar de hace muchísimos años, porque yo ya tengo mi edad que salió en el periódico del ER en el mundo. ¿Vale que es que según las multas que pusiese la Guardia Civil, ellos también se llevaban una parte de esa multa, eh? 00:40:42:05 - 00:41:15:18 Desconocido Eso está en el Estado, eso está en el histórico del periódico del mundo. Que no, que no me estoy inventando nada. ¿Dentro del histórico del periódico dije totalmente la verdad, porque incluso en el BOE aparecen las comisiones que se cobran, no? Sí, hay varias, varias organizaciones en las que en las cuales se indica el porcentaje por dar de alta, en que llegan a un orden también yo creo que sí que pueden estar incentivado, igual que cuando vas. 00:41:15:20 - 00:41:47:10 Desconocido Y a ti que te hacen una receta médica porque te da el receta de un medicamento y otro pues evidentemente eso es porque los médicos están cobrando por esa farmacéutica, por de patrocinio, claro, o te están patrocinando porque tú cuando le dices no, mira, es que esta medicina no la tiene el mismo componente que está bueno, pues tendrá el mismo componente que ésta, pero por la razón que sea, a mí no me hacen nada o a mí me va mal, pues te la tienes que tomar sí o sí porque te la receta el médico. 00:41:47:12 - 00:42:21:05 Desconocido Y si te la receta el médico es porque también se lleva una comisión por a la medicina no ganamos todo a base comercial y el que diga que que no, pues mira, los que no estamos así somos los los de a pie, los que bueno, los del montón. Y cómo crees a corto plazo la solución que que pueda tener con tu problema, que es lo que pedirías directamente. 00:42:21:08 - 00:42:57:13 Desconocido Bueno, pues yo pediría que cuando haces de aquí de la E una serie de problemas es que no me miren. Lo superficial es que me digan mira, es de la tensión y tienes que estar una temporada si es de los reactivos y para ver si vas sólo allá. ¿Pero es que precisamente las medicinas que mandan tanto para una cosa como otra, en que ya no podríamos conducir, la podríamos manejar, no podríamos, pero que estamos trabajando entonces y las personas que tienen estas meditaciones tan fuerte, eh? 00:42:57:16 - 00:43:34:04 Desconocido ¿Se están arriesgando, pero no se les está haciendo todo eso, que no sé si lo están arriesgando también la vida de otras muy muy muy clave, no? El tema de la medicación, porque tú en este momento estarás tomando cierta medicación, o bien por los vértigos o bien por el sangrado cerebral. Y naturalmente, dentro de lo que son las casas, aparece un simbolito del cochecito que recomendando conducir. 00:43:34:06 - 00:44:03:03 Desconocido Entonces hay una cosa que yo realmente no entiendo y es el porqué si te mandan esa medicación en la cual no puedes conducir un inspector o inspectora médica, que hay que decir también que no son especialistas en todos los en todas las ramas, porque hay inspectores que son rehabilitadores y no pueden atender a alguien que tenga un problema de corazón, por ejemplo, porque no tiene esa especialidad. 00:44:03:05 - 00:44:34:17 Desconocido Entonces yo lo que no entiendo es que si las médicas es que ellos tendrán ese informe también médico, con las medicaciones que estás tomando y te quieran dar el alta de de alguna forma. E Pues ahí es por eso estoy aquí, por eso estoy dando, porque hay medicaciones que están totalmente contraindicada con ya no solo con conducir, sino con utilizar o subirte a una escalera. 00:44:34:22 - 00:44:56:06 Desconocido ¿Y te vuelvo a decir que dentro del de donde yo estoy, de que si alguien limpieza sí, sí, pero yo tengo que ir y estoy sola, si tengo que subir la escalera, bueno, pues evito subirme a una silla porque soy bajita, eh? Yo no llegar al sitio y asiento pelear y me han proporcionado palos telescópico, me han proporcionado todo. 00:44:56:06 - 00:45:22:09 Desconocido Pero hay momentos en que tengo que coger un coche y tengo que cambiar, en que incluso tengo que ir por la calle, porque vale, dice, las tres veces que me he caído yo iba por la calle y ojo, no iba trabajando, no iba con el agobio de decir tengo que trabajar, tengo que acabar, estoy trabajando. La última vez que me caí yo ya estaba de baja. 00:45:22:11 - 00:45:54:01 Desconocido Fue el día 8 de enero, o sea que iba entre comillas, relajada. Vale, ya me iba con la tensión de tener que llegar a este sitio, enganchar al otro. ¿Vale, el tercer eh? Y no me vale que me venga hoy para hacerte publicidad comercial si yo tengo entre un un puesto y otro es que es equidistancia. ¿Hoy no hay un transporte público a mi disposición, vale? 00:45:54:03 - 00:46:19:14 Desconocido Y tardo lo que yo tardé en llegar. Eso vale ahora eso no me lo paga nadie. Y bueno, también el transporte público, indirectamente, como funciona en Alovera, no tenga lo verá en pero no sólo en Garbera, no lo verá en África, en Guadalajara, en Alovera. Es más particular porque hay un parque en un pueblo pequeño, pasan los autobuses cuando pasan y por una razón o no, pasan directamente. 00:46:19:16 - 00:46:53:22 Desconocido Eso también es cierto, pero en el transporte público lo mismo se trabaja en cada y en guardar los autobuses. ¿Hay autobuses que te comunica? Sí, sí, pero vamos a ver, por esa regla de tres, yo si con una medicación fuerte yo subieran un autobús y lo mismo me puede pasar al subirme al autobús, si no voy a mandar a nadie, la única que se va a matar o se va a morir de ello, pero también directamente dentro de lo que es la otra optativa, que es dejar de conducir. 00:46:53:22 - 00:47:20:15 Desconocido ¿No? Si me quedo en en un transporte público no arraiga a que a que te pueda dar un derrame cerebral. Me tienes a exactamente y y como somos todo. Ahí sí que nos vamos a meter un poco todos en el saco. Cuando ves a una persona que le pasa algo en la calle, o se marea o tiene cualquier cosa, lo primero que piensa es va borracho, va borracho. 00:47:20:15 - 00:47:56:11 Desconocido Y la omisión encima de de no es totalmente un delito. ¿Exactamente, eh? Mira, la gente o miramos para otro lado porque para que me vean me pasa que me complica la vida. Si ya la tengo muy complicada ya, pero no en el caso de que le pase algo y no le has auxiliado más. Detenido, naturalmente, porque ha sido testigo de de un accidente que ha pasado a ti en algún caso, que tú te has desmayado, o sea, te haya dado un síncope y haya gente que no te haya dicho nada o no hayas tenido esa ayuda. 00:47:56:13 - 00:48:45:21 Desconocido Sí y no, porque yo digo que siempre me llevo un ángel conmigo. ¿Vale? ¿Eh? En una ocasión he sí que perdí totalmente la noción del tiempo de donde estaba y. Pero sí que gracias a Dios en alguien me ve después de yo llevar un rato. Y en esa pérdida de conciencia, o sea, de no saber dónde estaba, sí que salió alguien y me me ayudó más, lo sé, pero había más gente alrededor y pues como cuando te encuentras con una pelea, todos miran pero nadie se acerca o graban también ahora con mi móvil en grabar. 00:48:45:23 - 00:49:05:10 Desconocido Bueno, lo importante es que estás que estás bien dentro de lo que cabe y si hay mucho peligro, o sea, dentro de lo que es tu patología y por eso yo te. Sí, por eso yo te he dicho desde el principio que la cuestión de hacerse la víctima simplemente es lo mismo que me pasa a mí. Ahí va persona. 00:49:05:10 - 00:49:33:19 Desconocido Yo no soy un bicho raro, yo no soy la única. Hay muchísimas más personas con patologías y sabes, y, y y y a lo mejor no son esas patologías. Si tú ves a la persona y dice oye, pues si está bien, pues sí, está bien, pero vamos a analizar qué es lo que le pasa. ¿A ver, tú crees que los médicos se preocupan de los pacientes ya hablándote de la inspección médica, que vemos claramente que no se preocupan de los pacientes? 00:49:33:19 - 00:49:57:23 Desconocido ¿No, eh? ¿Debido a su falta de ética directamente? Porque no sé si sabes, pero hacen un juramento que es el juramento hipocrático, el cual son siete leyes que tienen que ser respetables. Si no las respetan. La gran mayoría tienes que tener una vocación. Entonces ellos al ser sanitarios deberían de empatizar más por por el paciente y no por el cliente. 00:49:57:27 - 00:50:28:20 Desconocido Vamos, sabes que quiero. Oye, quiero llegar a que son tratados como clientes, como números, directamente porque les importa dados de alta. Bueno, vamos a ver más que cliente, porque tú. Si tú tienes un negocio propio y tú tienes un cliente, tú ese cliente lo cuidas para que no se te vaya. Nos tratan como a números, como cuando coges una res y la sellas porque esta es mía y me va la carne, le va la leche o me va la lana o igual él. 00:50:28:20 - 00:50:47:00 Desconocido Es la misma comparación. A lo mejor sana muy a lo bestia y a lo mejor que no hay tampoco. Eso sí, que suene como sea. Sí, a lo mejor quien no haya vivido en el campo no sabe lo que estoy diciendo, pero está allí, o sea, esta red mía y hago con ellos lo que me da la gana y mañana la pongo a trabajar. 00:50:47:00 - 00:51:16:13 Desconocido Y si no está bien, pues mira, me la cargo, pasa por el matadero y ya le sacaré de otra ganancia. ¿Que qué cambiarías, que pedirías directamente a el Gobierno, por ejemplo, en este caso al gobierno regional? ¿ER Mira, como que no me voy a quedar, fíjate, me voy a quedar en el gobierno y no en el y en el de Castilla-La Mancha, vale? 00:51:16:15 - 00:52:05:10 Desconocido Porque en un momento determinado yo ya hablé con la señora Presidenta y me dijo no estamos al corriente. Y respuesta mía sí señor. A partir de este momento estás al corriente de lo que está pasando. ER Me voy a quedar en el en Guadalajara, vale, en lo que es la provincia, en los gobernantes de aquí, de la provincia de la Diputación y en diputaciones, en lo que es aquí provincia de Guadalajara, porque si estos señores tienen potestad vale como un equipo único fuera para darme el alta, así por las buenas tienen que tener también la potestad para mandarme a un buen especialista, independientemente de lo que cueste. 00:52:05:12 - 00:52:40:18 Desconocido Vale para y tienen esa capacidad. Y si por encima de ellos se supone que hay un gobierno, el gobierno lo ponemos nosotros, lo pone el pueblo, o sea que es y que están ahí porque yo le he dado mi confianza. Ellos entre comillas, están al servicio mío, no yo al servicio de ellos, vale. Entonces a mí no me vale que a día de hoy en Guadalajara Servicios Sociales diga que no saben nada. 00:52:40:20 - 00:53:26:22 Desconocido Pues mira, he advertido a la escuela porque las noticias están en todas las redes sociales y en otro momento, vale, en otro momento ya tendría. Bueno, porque no saben nada. Pero ahora con redes sociales que ponemos continuamente barbaridades porque los atacamos directamente a ellos, que estén mirando para otro lado. A mí me parece una incoherencia total por parte de ellos y que encima tengan el morro de decir no, es que no me he enterado, no te has enterado porque no has querido enterarte, porque si tú piensas que lo que en esa red social en la que sea y para Instagram, Facebook en directo salen noticias y tú no las compruebas, vale, a mí me puede 00:53:26:22 - 00:53:49:02 Desconocido caer una multa por mentir o por difamar. ¿Vale? Por eso te estoy diciendo que yo tengo todo un historial ahí, que lo puedo enseñar, o sea que no estoy inventando nada. ¿Y bueno, pues igual que a mí me puede caer una multa por por levantar los pies del suelo, que sea que se pongan las pilas, vale? Y que nos atiendan a todos. 00:53:49:02 - 00:54:26:13 Desconocido O sea, que vaya si tienen que ir viendo caso por caso o que lo vayan viendo porque tienen de eso eso que está por encima. Vale, tienen que ir por detrás administrativo, tienen el conserje, tienen gente que le pueden ir pasando, o sea, y verificando esa información. Vale, aquí no estoy yo acusando a nadie, vale, pero sí que verifique la información y sí que sean reales con lo que dice y que sean congruentes, ni más ni menos. 00:54:26:15 - 00:54:59:21 Desconocido Y tú piensas que ellos no se enteran de las cosas directamente, como dices, a través de las redes sociales es muy fácil enterarse de las cosas, a no ser que no vean las redes sociales, pero ellos tienen sus propios community managers, por ejemplo, que llevan sus redes sociales si pueden atenderla. Las quejas directamente cuando como les escribes. No hablo, por ejemplo, de la presidencia autonómica que tiene el chat abierto y una persona que traslada al señor Page le trasladas sus sus cosas. 00:54:59:21 - 00:55:29:17 Desconocido ¿Otra cosa es que el señor baje, tome las medidas que debería de tomar, que únicamente por lo que se ve a nivel regional o a nivel nacional, las medidas se toman cuando son elecciones, no? Claro, pero es que claro, mientras tanto no es políticamente correcto, porque mientras tanto. ¿ER bueno, pues vamos parcheando ahí, no acusando a ellos de lo que eh que que el ciudadano este entre comillas donde? 00:55:29:20 - 00:56:10:27 Desconocido Porque me vuelvo a reiterar, ellos están ahí, pues es por nosotros, vale que ellos están ahí, pues que nosotros ya nuestra confianza, pero si pudiésemos lo mismo para darle la confianza que para saltársela. ¿Está seguro que muchos de los que estaban ya tampoco tal? La verdad que sí, que muchos estaríamos fuera la solución que podemos encontrar a esto referente a los de no votarles, no directamente y que se sienten, se sientan un poco, un poco solos, no es como escarmiento directamente en cuestión de ellos. 00:56:10:29 - 00:56:36:22 Desconocido ¿También hay una cosa que no me gusta mucho, que es la falta de personal, no? O sea, por eso hay tantas listas de espera, porque la mayoría de los médicos, además que son mal pagados en España, todo hay que decirlo, se van y emigran a Francia e Italia o o o Alemania, que son donde más cobran. ¿Entonces aquí el personal médico es irrisorio y más por ejemplo en un sitio como es Guadalajara, no? 00:56:36:25 - 00:56:54:29 Desconocido Hombre, es que tú no puede. Ni tú ni yo podemos ir a una consulta médica durante es que se tienen que ir de y eso se puede ver también y se puede comprobar. A ti te han citado a las diez y 20 y a las diez y 25 tienes otra paciente y a las diez y 15 tenía el anterior paciente. 00:56:55:01 - 00:57:28:09 Desconocido ¿Vamos a ver, que no somos ganado, que tú a mí en cinco minutos qué me vas a decir? ¿Es que no me puede dar tiempo? Buenos días. Es que. Es que eso también es un punto, el punto clave, no el tiempo. ¿El tiempo no solamente espera por falta de personal, sino el tiempo de la consulta, que tiene un tiempo estipulado de cinco minutos o diez minutos como máximo, en lo cual pues en diez minutos sí que te van a hacer, pero vas con un dolor de riñón que hacen clac, clac, clac, clac y ya tienes un cólico, pero no te examinan exactamente, eh? 00:57:28:11 - 00:57:53:15 Desconocido Aparte de lo que tengo la espalda, yo también la tengo. Más vale que el neurocirujano a mí me mandó, eh. Me ha mandado por dos veces que también tengo los papeles guardado por dos veces a la unidad del dolor. La segunda vez que me manda ésta después de pandemia, porque aquí se han escudado todos en la pandemia. Vale, te estoy hablando del año. 00:57:53:18 - 00:58:27:13 Desconocido Puede ser el 2020. Puede ser que ahora mismo no, no me acuerdo de la fecha concreta. Llego al Hospital de Guadalajara y también lo puedo enseñar. Llego a misión. Ah bueno, en misión a donde te dan la cita y me dice la señorita que le está atendiendo que no te unidad del dolor en Guadalajara y pues como o sea que con lo que es la provincia de Guadalajara, la provincia eh, el es toda la gente de la provincia, porque es grande. 00:58:27:13 - 00:58:55:18 Desconocido Molina de Aragón viene al Hospital de Guadalajara, Sigüenza, viene al Hospital de Guadalajara, entonces de la Sierra Norte también, más los todos los que hay, trabaja que no conozco y no tenemos unidad del dolor, simplemente no Durante la pandemia se quitó y el director del hospital no la no considerado oportuna. Digo pues dame una hoja de reclamaciones, puse esa hoja de reclamación y me escribió el señor Bueno, el que fue. 00:58:55:24 - 00:59:17:07 Desconocido Yo no digo que fuese el director, vale que estuviese al lado, que le hiciese la carta, que también la tengo ahí. Me dijo que hombre, que sentía mucho mi patología pero que eran los médicos y con la misma respondí y le dije no el que, el que es el director y el que tiene que gestionar y el que tiene que contratar es usted. 00:59:17:10 - 00:59:55:08 Desconocido O sea, sí, si usted no contrata con el médico, el médico no vaya a ofrecerse el médico está ahí para trabajar. Otra cosa que bueno, pues eh, en cuestión de dos, tres meses me llaman, me dicen que me van a hacer una resonancia tanto de cervicales como de columna. Y sí, la resonancia me la hicieron, pero de esto hace tres años y a día de hoy a mí no me ha visto ninguno esto ni nadie de de la unidad del dolor. 00:59:55:10 - 01:00:38:16 Desconocido A día de hoy la resonancia está hecha, pero en la unidad del dolor no ha asistido para nada, o sea, las resonancias ni me han llamado. Las resonancias las tienes hechas. Me imagino que te habrán dado algún tipo de diagnóstico. No, ninguno. Diagnóstico. Yo sé el diagnóstico porque cuando yo he ido a Toledo, el neurocirujano las ha visto y sé el diagnóstico por el neurocirujano de Toledo, pero no porque aquí de Guadalajara, que era de donde me tenían que llamar, de la unidad del dolor, me hayan llamado, entre otras cosas, esto hace tres años, dentro otra cosa o dos años y medio vale. 01:00:38:16 - 01:01:13:03 Desconocido Entre otras cosas porque a día de hoy yo no sé ni tan siquiera si hay unidad del dolor en Guadalajara, en el hospital. Hombre, yo creo que dentro del hospital tiene que haber una unidad de dolor, siendo Guadalajara, sea Madrid o que te deriven a cualquier unidad, porque una persona que tiene una patología con, en este caso con la columna, con dolores que son infrahumanos, tendrá que haber una unidad de dolor, porque igual que tienen una unidad para las personas que tienen las migas del sueño, pues me imagino que tendrán que tener una unidad para el. 01:01:13:06 - 01:01:35:25 Desconocido O bueno, que hagan una derivación a Madrid, no a Madrid por ejemplo, o si no a Madrid o a otro sitio, a un centro privado. Exactamente, pero que sea más atendido. Pero por eso te digo que yo no sea ese día. Sí que es cierto. Yo puse la reclamación y tengo esos papeles guardados. O sea que en hay cosas que que ni a tiros ni tiraré nunca están ahí. 01:01:35:28 - 01:01:57:19 Desconocido ¿Esas cosas tienen que quedar resguardadas siempre, eh? Y sí que está la reclamación hecha. Está en la contestación de lo que me dijo el médico. Digo lo médico, digo, no me lo puede meter, vamos. ¿Y además que en aquella carta muy correctamente, eh? ¿Bueno, pues me dice lo que me pienso, lo que pensaba de este señor, que yo no lo conozco, eh? 01:01:57:21 - 01:02:35:23 Desconocido Pero vamos, que no sé. Y sí, me llamaron, pero me hicieron las pruebas. Pero ahí está, ahí está la prueba hecha sin diagnosticar, ya te lo digo yo. ¿O sea que imagino que sin medicina tampoco para, claro, eh? ¿Que te toma? Pues mira, cuando no tengo Dolores. Bueno, pongo y ahí y funciona bien cuando tienes dolores con lo primero que pilla, ya que ahí hay veces que no, no te calma con cualquier cosa, pero pero en éste, en este caso si no tienes ningún tipo de diagnóstico. 01:02:35:25 - 01:03:14:21 Desconocido Er La verdad es que es que me resulta tan, no sé, el trato que estás recibiendo, que sé que no eres la única que está recibiendo ese trato vejatorio por por parte tanto de la acreditación del hospital o de o de los médicos en general. Me parece increíble que mira, no te diagnostiquen un interés por parte del torero, por ejemplo, que es la la central, pero sigan sin darte ese diagnóstico y sigan sin derivar a una unidad del dolor que me imagino que tolero que también es grande. 01:03:14:21 - 01:03:20:24 Desconocido Y siendo la capital no social de Castilla-La Mancha, tendría que tener. 01:03:20:26 - 01:04:05:11 Desconocido Pero claro, y Toledo sí la tiene. Pero eh, los viajes son a costa de uno, porque dice coge todos los tickets. Sí, sí, coges todos los ticket y que te los abonamos. No abonan nada, se te hartas de hacer reclamaciones y no hago nada. O sea, no te hago nada, va por tu cuenta. Tanto te vaya en en vehículo privado como si te va en autobús, te vas donde sea o como si te tienes que estar una noche allí de la esta en la distancia no te abonan nada, o sea, va pasando, va pasando y no se tiene la solución. 01:04:05:13 - 01:04:34:16 Desconocido Por eso te digo que es el desplazamiento, ya que te derivan a un sitio. Deberían de hacerse cargo con eso. ¿Sí, sí, pero para eso pagamos nosotros, no? A nivel laboral damos nuestro dinero a la seguridad social. Exactamente, que la Seguridad Social, por mucho que se piense la gente, la seguridad social somos todos igual que Hacienda, todo. Si yo no pago Hacienda, no voy a tener colegios, no voy a tener carreteras, no voy a tener una serie de cosas. 01:04:34:18 - 01:05:04:27 Desconocido Eso es lo que no nos dicen, pero yo creo que bueno, lo voy a dejar ahí, seguro, pero sí que realmente es una que estamos pagando todos, igual que como decías que casi nadie y debería de mojarse un poco, no por lo que es el paciente y al ser derivado no directamente. Y yo sigo insistiendo también en en tu problema, no en este problema que tienes en el en el cerebro. 01:05:05:00 - 01:05:32:17 Desconocido Si es que el tener no perdón, no me saldría la palabra y que se siga directamente actuando sobre ese problema que busquen. Es que es que mira, hay una de las de las cosas que has dicho es que te da una, te puede dar un ictus y te puede dar. Claro que me puede dar. Está ahí, o sea, científicamente es ahí. 01:05:32:17 - 01:05:56:21 Desconocido Y los neurólogos ya no me voy a neurocirujano, el neurólogo lo sabe, que te puede dar que me puede dar desde un ictus hasta un derrame cerebral. Cuánta gente hay que le da un ictus y aparentemente no tenía nada, no tenía nada. Y la O le ha dado un derrame cerebral o se ha quedado o es porque tenía este problema y no es sintomático exactamente. 01:05:56:21 - 01:06:15:26 Desconocido ¿Y no se sabía o este problema o otro no, porque como hay gente que que se mantiene durante mucho tiempo en una subida de tensión, una subida de tensión, um, vamos a ver lo que a mi me ha pasado en el ojo, pues lo menos que me puede dar un derrame en el ojo y eso ha salido a sale a la luz no? 01:06:15:28 - 01:06:36:09 Desconocido Pero te da un derrame en cualquier otro sitio, no sale y te quedas y dices pues si estaba bien claro, estaba bien, pero a lo mejor eso ha mantenido en el tiempo. ¿No vas al médico? Bueno, a otra cosa no vas al médico, tú pides cita hoy y te dan la cita para ver. Es para dentro de diez días. 01:06:36:11 - 01:07:21:21 Desconocido Vamos a ver, señores, en diez días puede estar perfectamente enterrado. Y yo el. El traumatólogo. El traumatólogo me ha pedido desde de. Desde último, de cuando me dio o me dio el día 18. Ojo me mandó el médico para lo del hombro. El día 18 de yo pensé porque me mandó preferente a primeros de diciembre y yo al 18 y dije a con mira, dentro de diez días está la cita bien y me presento porque yo no había visto la fecha bien, había vista solo 18 y me presento en la consulta y me dice la señora la que me atiende Sí, sí, va el 18 pero de enero. 01:07:21:24 - 01:07:58:05 Desconocido Y digo osea y esto es preferente por lo que no sea preferente 12 me de el 18 de enero y me dan la ecografía para el día 22 de marzo. ¿Así va a ser la sanidad, no? Claro, la mejor de Europa no solo me la dan para el 22 de marzo. El traumatólogo me vuelve a ver el día de abril y entre ésta me llama a juicio y me dice que me da el alta como bien, pero si es que todavía no me ha dicho lo que me tenía que hacer. 01:07:58:07 - 01:08:44:26 Desconocido Ya, pero es que directamente sí te tienen que hacer las pruebas y ellos tienen esos, esos informes clínicos tuyos en los cuales tiene que tener un aviso, en el que en el que diga pues tiene que cita a tal, tal tal. ¿En este momento no puedes desempeñar con la boda, eh? Laboral pues puesto que tú estás de baja y estás esperando ciertas citas para para que te atiendan, es que lo veo directamente, sí, y si no, si ya que me llamas adelantarme las listas de lo que tengo, pero dame eso ya que me llama, dame una solución, la no la solución que me da. 01:08:44:29 - 01:09:19:12 Desconocido Ponte a trabajar a ver si tanto en inspección no tanto. ¿Quieren mandar al trabajadora a su lugar de trabajo? ¿Deberían ellos mismos no hablar directamente con los propios médicos para adelantar esas citas, no? Sí, exactamente eso. Eso fue una de las cosas que yo le he dicho ayer. ER adelanta me llama por teléfono y adelantan esta cita. No espere a que el médico de cabecera me mande o el traumatólogo me mande al rehabilitador. 01:09:19:15 - 01:09:42:17 Desconocido Mándame tú al rehabilitador. A eso nosotros no lo podemos hacer. Yo no tengo potestad para eso. ¿Cómo que usted no tiene potestad para eso? ¿Entonces tampoco tiene potestad para nada, Está claro? Eso es lo que digo. O sea que directamente los rehabilita, o sea, los rehabilitadores. ¿Perdón, es que estaba pensando en una inspectora que es rehabilitadora, no? Sí. 01:09:42:19 - 01:10:15:23 Desconocido Entonces digo, si no tienen potestad para darse de alta, por qué insiste nuevamente en que una de las inspectoras en este caso es la mujer es una reputada y encima rehabilitadora, que tiene muchas empresas en muchos sitios y que luego está en Guadalajara. La funcionaria ni idea, no es funcionaria y lo paga con los pacientes que que no tienen ningún problema, pero lo pagamos los fans. 01:10:15:23 - 01:10:36:18 Desconocido Yo como decía antiguamente he tenido que tomar un poco de alta para que para ser un poquito más empática en diferentes cuestiones y por ejemplo dice que no tiene potestad, pero es que no tiene potestad, porque en este caso esta persona que es rehabilitadora no puede mandarte a un neurólogo, no puede hablar con un neurólogo porque realmente no sabe qué problema tiene esto. 01:10:36:18 - 01:11:03:14 Desconocido Yo creo que no han ni los informes. No, no, no, eso me queda claro que ella no se ningún informe, ella te llama ella, ella o ellos te llaman ellos ya, o ellos. Bueno, no me gusta utilizar esa palabra, porque Es la Real Academia. No la contempla, no sale en los informes. O sea, ellos que mira por este problema y es por esto por lo que está demás. 01:11:03:15 - 01:11:31:03 Desconocido Sí, sí, yo estoy. Esto da de baja, pero lo que yo tengo detrás, porque es la pescadilla que se muerde la cola, o sea, tú me ves una patología, pero engloba todo, porque hasta esa patología viene de todo lo demás que está, por así decirlo, oculto, que no se ve porque a simple vista no se ve y es por ahí por lo que no lo están. 01:11:31:06 - 01:12:05:11 Desconocido ¿Igual que me pasa a mí, le pasa al resto de las personas, eh? Sí, además que hay muchísimas personas que están afectadas hoy, no, yo ayer, concretamente ayer. No sé si fueron dos o tres personas, estaba y luego esa eh, tú vas a ir a la cita con la inspectora y tú no puedes entrar acompañada, tienes que entrar solo, porque claro, a los señores inspectores les da miedo, no vaya a ser que el que va contigo de acompañante sea agresivo, pero lo voy a dejar ahí. 01:12:05:16 - 01:12:27:03 Desconocido Pero hay otra cosa en la que yo no entiendo porque en todos los sitios te dejan ir con un acompañante. En el caso de que se pongan agresivos, tienen un vigilante de seguridad que pueda ir y pagamos un vigilante de seguridad en los centros médicos para que no ocurran ciertas cosas de agresividad. Pero es que también se merecen algunas veces. 01:12:27:04 - 01:12:57:22 Desconocido Alguna vez. Sí, sí, de vez en cuando sí. Pero no, no es la correcta, porque la violencia solo engendra violencia, entonces no la manera correcta. Pero, y ya te digo, había dos o tres personas que salieron antes que y vamos a ver, no era esta señora rehabilitadora, porque la señora rehabilitadora me tocó a mí, eran otros directores, pero que actúan de la misma manera, con la misma y como están por encima de ti actuar con la misma intensidad. 01:12:57:22 - 01:13:38:06 Desconocido ¿A ellos no les va a pasar nunca nada, eh? ¿Pues bueno, vale y dos o tres personas delante mía me dijo mi marido que habían pedido y es para poner reclamaciones porque evidentemente y mi marido estaba esperando y me dice qué te ha dicho para poner la reclamación? Digo no, no, no, necesitamos poner hoy la reclamación hoy no necesita ponerla hoy, ayer vale, pero a lo mejor dentro de tres días tengo que ponerla y tengo claro que voy a poner reclamación y me voy a ir al juzgado y voy a denunciar, independientemente que valga o no vale, pero puedo hacerlo, lo voy a hacer. 01:13:38:09 - 01:14:02:04 Desconocido ¿Y es acciones, eso es otra, no? Que son larguísimos. Tienes que esperar muchísimo tiempo porque tiene que llegar a Toledo. Exactamente. ¿El pero es el único, él es lo único que nos queda, o sea, hacer reclamación y poner e ir al juzgado de lo civil o al juzgado, en este caso de la sociedad, eh? Y poner esa reclamación. 01:14:02:04 - 01:14:26:05 Desconocido ¿Yo no estoy para irme a trabajar, eh? ¿Bueno, y otra cosa, ahí también otro tema añadido, no? Que hay gente que hay personas que coge, déjame trabajar, yo no voy a dejar de trabajar. Eso también lo tengo muy claro, la manera de trabajar, porque por mí, por su patología o porque no están para trabajar y como le de trabajo pierden el puesto de trabajo. 01:14:26:05 - 01:14:51:20 Desconocido Exactamente, pierden el puesto de trabajo. Ahí es lo que yo nací puesto. Bueno, pues moveré Roma con Santiago. Mira, recurso humano, mira dónde me tenga que ir. Pero ustedes tienen todos mis informes, porque yo no le he ocultado nada. Entonces vamos a ponerme entre todos. Solución Es que no es la única, es la única cosa que nos queda denunciar, denunciar y hacerlo visible. 01:14:51:27 - 01:15:23:08 Desconocido ¿Tendría que ser todo una denuncia colectiva, eh? Bueno, colectiva sí, sea entre colectividades podemos, que es que no una denuncia a nivel particular, una otra, otra, otra. Además a er formado un colectivo, entonces evidentemente no se va a mirar de la misma manera una denuncia, si hay 20 denuncia iguales y por ejemplo, en cuestionar. ¿Desde la inspección reciben denuncias? 01:15:23:11 - 01:15:42:21 Desconocido ¿Muchísimas a lo largo de todos los días pero es que siguen actuando de la misma forma y nadie está haciendo nada ya esa, eh? Pues por eso yo me he ido antes también a los políticos, porque que no me diga los políticos de turno que había entre el Ministerio de Sanidad, porque el Ministerio de Sanidad también tiene que tener los datos. 01:15:42:24 - 01:16:12:21 Desconocido Exactamente por eso digo que no me pueden decir es que no nos enteramos y están mirando para otro lado. Bueno señores, si estáis ahí encima que nos estáis contando a nosotros el dinero, porque tú tienes ahí ese puesto, porque te estamos pagando nosotros, el dinero te lo estamos pagando entre todos y que actúes así no tiene sentido. ¿No tiene sentido que nosotros como usuarios y nosotros como pacientes, sigamos permitiendo eso, no? 01:16:12:23 - 01:16:39:18 Desconocido Y además, aparte de las denuncias, huelgas, por ejemplo, yo creo que sería también otra alternativa. ¿Sí, pero un movimiento, una llamada a la acción, a personas que se muevan no? ¿Pero luego ahí pasa lo mismo que esto, eh? ¿Quien quiere ponerse delante de una huelga? ¿Quién quiere estar exponerse que no sé la gente, Toda la gente tiene miedo y el miedo es libre, no? 01:16:39:20 - 01:17:00:09 Desconocido ¿Pero quién quiere ponerse? ¿Coge lo poquita gente que quiere exponerse, Quién quiere presentar una denuncia, exponerse porque tiene miedo directamente? Claro, claro, por el sí. Yo pienso el principal miedo que tenemos el ser humano es el qué dirán. Pero llega un momento que el qué dirán. Te tiene que importar el que dirán o el que, o el que me podría pasar a mí. 01:17:00:09 - 01:17:33:24 Desconocido No vas a ver qué me puede pasar a mí más de lo que ya me está pasando con mi patología que yo no puedo hacer, entre comillas, un día a día normal, claro. ¿Qué más me puede pasar? ¿Irías a manifestarte, eh? Y yo me manifestaría, pero, eh, no sé, yo sí, claro que me manifestaría. Claro que he ido a huelgas, pero de otra manera. 01:17:33:24 - 01:18:06:03 Desconocido O sea, y está visto que aquí hay cosas que en España. ¿Bueno, porque no, sí que seguimos como estábamos hace dos siglos, que avanzando hemos avanzado nada, no? Entonces habría que hacerlo de desde mi punto de vista. ¿Um pues mira lo que estás haciendo tú hoy, vale? Er Pero claro, no una persona sola que dé la cara, sino una otra, otra, otra, eh, escribirle al Defensor del pueblo perfecto. 01:18:06:06 - 01:18:38:08 Desconocido Pero claro, luego, eh, se encuentran con que, eh, donde van dirigidas. Es que el Defensor del Pueblo tiene una serie de explicaciones y no le responde. ¿Pero bueno, pues ahí también son los políticos, no los que se deberían de mojar un poco, porque yo pienso que por encima, porque para qué tenemos ir al Defensor del Pueblo si nada es defensor del Pueblo o crees que actúa bien en ese caso? 01:18:38:11 - 01:19:08:28 Desconocido ¿En este caso, eh? ¿Bueno, vamos a ver, yo entiendo los tiempos en administración son los tiempos que tú tienes una denuncia, no? A ti te han llegado una serie de denuncias y tú pregunte, no te contesten, vuelvas a preguntar, tampoco te contestan. ¿Entonces a la tercera vez que tú preguntas y no tiene respuesta es cuando se puede, puede el Defensor del Pueblo, por así decirlo, pues mandarlo o o ver lo que está pasando, vale? 01:19:09:03 - 01:19:37:17 Desconocido Porque son los tiempos. Esos tiempos yo digo que deberían de ser más cortos porque hay persona que no oye, hay personas que no tienen tanto tiempo. Efectivamente, vale, entonces deberían de ser más cortos y deberían de ser más ágiles y deberían de otra manera, pues no funcionar de otra manera, porque a ti y a mí nos cogen en cualquier escaramuza, nos cogen haciendo un robo. 01:19:37:17 - 01:20:06:18 Desconocido Como somos Don nadie, pueden seguir dando más azúcar. Pero ahora, exactamente ahí no hay igualdad, no hay. ¡Eh, eh, eh, quítate! Ya no hay un equilibrio. Entonces como no hay un equilibrio, mientras que nosotros, que somos los usuarios, no nos pongamos todos de acuerdo, ese equilibrio a estar ahí, pues con eso nos vamos a quedar, con ese equilibrio que necesitamos. 01:20:06:20 - 01:20:57:21 Desconocido Aunque yo insisto en que dar un poco de caña través de la visibilidad, bueno, esto ya sabes que se hace visible muy rápido y además tenemos muchísimas redes en las cuales se saca el provecho, no podríamos decir de darle la visibilidad que se merece un tema tan candente como este. Desde nuestro punto de vista, desde un punto de vista que no tiene ningún tipo de censura, en el cual se puede hablar de muchísimas cosas, no vamos a hacer todo lo posible para que seamos vistos, seamos escuchados y que se hagan los los valores que se que hacer directamente hacia las personas que tienen diferentes patologías y con esos problemas, no con con las inspecciones médicas 01:20:57:21 - 01:21:49:23 Desconocido o con sanidad en general debido al gran problema que tienen. Muchísimas gracias. Voy ver a expresarme. Sí, claro, de eso se trata, de poder expresarse cada uno como pueda y quiera y sin que haya ninguna censura ni ninguna manipulación de por medio, que eso es también muy importante y creo, porque directamente ya los medios de comunicación están sumamente manipulados y politizados, en los cuales no dicen cosas como tienen que ser, no muestran lo que es la realidad, no muestran la realidad porque no, lo políticamente correcto no es lo que todo el mundo quiere oír, pero porque todo se rige a través de una política. 01:21:49:25 - 01:22:19:06 Desconocido Exactamente. Y hay que hacer caso al que manda más. Y bueno, o por ejemplo, una ética periodística en la cual te manipulan, te indican muchas veces lo que tienes que decir. Si, si, sí, está claro, hay manipulación en todo, en todo momento, en todos los sectores. Pero bueno, si vamos a dejarlo ahí, ya te he dicho, yo ya creo que he dicho bastante. 01:22:19:08 - 01:23:06:12 Desconocido Y yo como decía Cristo, que quien quiera escuchar, que quiera oír, que escuche, que escuche, no sé. Muchísimas gracias María Ángeles, por tu testimonio, por estar aquí en el punto de vista. Ha sido un verdadero placer y espero una pronta recuperación. Y a ustedes y a ustedes les emplazo a la próxima semana con el punto de vista.

Hoy tenemos un tema bastante delicado porque son los desafíos de la inclusión en el Instituto Ferran Casablancas en Sabadell y las barreras hacia la aceptación, en este caso de un estado de un estudiante con autismo se encuentra en el ojo de la tormenta debido a un caso que destaca la necesidad urgente de abordar las barreras para la inclusión de estudiantes con con autismo. 00:00:53:00 - 00:01:26:16 Desconocido Una madre coraje que vamos a conocer enseguida se ha visto obligada a lidiar con la dolorosa realidad de que su hijo, diagnosticado con autismo, haya sido rechazado por la institución educativa una vez finalizada la Educación Secundaria obligatoria, generando consecuencias adversas para la salud mental del menor del menor. El caso en cuestión revela una problemática más amplia relacionada con la inclusión de estudiantes con con especialidades en el sistema educativo. 00:01:26:16 - 00:01:58:14 Desconocido A pesar de los avances en conciencia sobre la diversidad y la inclusión, persisten desafíos significativos como la discriminación y la falta de recursos adaptados. Esta madre, esta madre coraje, pues denuncia que su hijo al enfrentar el rechazo en el Instituto Ferran Casablancas, que lo vamos a mencionar muchísimo para no darle publicidad buena y positiva, sino para darle la publicidad que se merece. 00:01:58:16 - 00:02:28:17 Desconocido Pues como decíamos, hay consecuencias para para la salud de este menor directamente. La inclusión no se trata solo de admitir físicamente a estudiantes en las aulas, sino crear un ambiente que fomente respeto, la comprensión y la adaptación a las necesidades individuales, cosa que en este caso no se está cumpliendo. Tenemos hoy en el punto de vista a Sheila. 00:02:28:19 - 00:03:08:06 Desconocido Bienvenida, Sheila. Hola, Muchas gracias. Más o menos. Es prácticamente lo que. Lo que he contado, lo que. Lo que está ocurriendo con con tu hijo dentro de lo que es este. Este instituto. ¿Recibisteis una notificación, una carta? No, en la cual si la tengo, la tengo aquí. Y la carta lo que dice es que debido A1A problemas que tu hijo ha causado, como. 00:03:08:06 - 00:03:42:20 Desconocido ¿Como cortes, insultos y demás, cosa que es totalmente falso según se ha visto en una red social, en este caso tic toc, en la cual es totalmente falso la que sale tu hijo directamente, explicando también que es lo que podía haber ocurrido, que es lo que había ocurrido, no? ¿Entonces cuéntame cuál es, cuál es el paso que se está llevando a cabo con con este instituto? 00:03:42:22 - 00:04:16:08 Desconocido ¿ER Pues ahora mismo mi hijo no está yendo porque está muy mal, obviamente, porque nuevamente se siente discriminado, eh? Nuevamente que se sienta un bicho raro y ahora no, y luego psicológicamente lo han destruido tanto que se ve incapaz de hacer un bachillerato. ¿Eh? ¿Todo esto está en manos de Ensenyament, eh? He hablado varias veces con el inspector. 00:04:16:11 - 00:04:51:24 Desconocido Eh, que le toca ese centro. El jueves tengo reunión con el inspector y con la jefa de la inspección. ¿Eh? También he puesto una denuncia por los Mossos d'Esquadra. Er. Hay un examen de Sabadell. También me he puesto en contacto también con la alcaldesa de Sabadell con Lazo. Bueno, vale, parece que hemos perdido la señal. Ya la tenemos recuperada nuevamente. 00:04:51:27 - 00:05:27:01 Desconocido Es la pregunta. Vale. Vale. El ESO. Er. ¿Porque también han habido casos de transfobia tanto por parte del profesorado como por parte del alumnado, no? Claro que hay que decir una cosa que no, que no he dicho porque no sabía si podía decirlo. ¿No? ¿Sí, sí, es que tu, tu hijo ha realizado el proceso de transformación, no? Para, para, para ser chico. 00:05:27:03 - 00:06:04:03 Desconocido Y dentro de eso también ha tenido esa discriminación. ¿Sí, y es un centro inclusivo supuestamente, no? Sí, supuestamente dentro de A estabas comentando que en este momento él no está yendo a a clase por por el tema de de que se está ocasionando en en el instituto. ¿No es este revuelo, no? A Me llamó mucho la atención, por ejemplo, el tema de que decía que se auto iniciaba. 00:06:04:06 - 00:06:38:09 Desconocido Claro, no, eso no es eso, eso se llama el AVE, es que tiene un nombre como comentabas. ¿Bueno, en cuestiones técnicas pues tampoco vamos a saberlo, no? ¿Pero que se rascaba mucho no? Y que al rascarse se rasca compulsivamente y es una manera que tienen los autistas. No digo el tema de rascar eh, es una de las cosas que hacen para regularse. 00:06:38:12 - 00:07:13:05 Desconocido Estereotipia se llama estereotipia. Sí, sí, también yo que sé. Se muerde la ropa hasta tal punto de romperla o se pone a dar vueltas, hace los típicos. El típico balanceo que es más conocido de los autistas se mover compulsivamente la pierna, andar de un lado para otro y en algo también le dan como tics de levantar la mano. 00:07:13:05 - 00:07:47:11 Desconocido Empieza ciego a con el cuello. ¿Bueno, son síntomas que tiene de autismo no? ¿O sea, si yo por ejemplo como de exteriorizar los nervios hacia afuera, el el único que me parece que haya estereotipia eh? ¿Dañinos que podrían ser está de rascarse compulsivamente? Pues porque claro, al final se acaba haciendo daño, pero el resto no le repercute negativamente a él, simplemente es una manera como de relacionarse. 00:07:47:13 - 00:08:19:12 Desconocido De hecho, yo conozco muchos casos de autismo porque nosotros hemos hablado antes en previamente, antes del programa, y yo te comenté un caso muy cercano mío. Hay distintos grados de autismo, aunque siempre existe ese ese factor de los movimientos de rascar y demás. Pero por lo menos yo lo que he visto de tu hijo, naturalmente no lo podemos mostrar en pantalla porque es un menor. 00:08:19:15 - 00:09:03:16 Desconocido Pero lo que he visto de tu hijo tiene una conversación coherente. No, no es como el caso que yo conozco, que se expresa sin sin hablar a través de signos, con lo cual, dentro de la inclusividad en el centro, ha podido aprender de una manera normal, aunque cueste un poquito más el aprendizaje debido al al autismo, que tenga un poco de déficit de atención, pero lo que a mí no me no me gusta es el comportamiento que este centro está teniendo con con con tu hijo, porque le está afectando. 00:09:03:18 - 00:09:37:26 Desconocido Si ya tiene un, un, una, una cosa que es ser una persona especial y de hecho las personas autistas son muchísimo más sensibles, no que una persona que no tiene autismo como como tú o como yo afecta psicológicamente muchísimo más. Entonces lo estará pasando en este momento, pues de alguna forma no sé si habrá recibido también bullying por parte de sus compañeros por el tema de la memoria los últimos días que fue al al colegio. 00:09:37:28 - 00:10:06:06 Desconocido Bullying como tal no, pero lo que hacían era hacerle el vacío como si no existiera. Pero tanto alumnado como profesorado lo ignoraban totalmente. Pero dentro de dentro de lo que es. A ver, entiendo que dentro del alumnado no, porque ya sabemos que los niños son muy muy crueles, tienden a ser demasiado crueles. ¿Pero a nivel de profesorado me parece un poco vergonzoso, no? 00:10:06:07 - 00:10:42:17 Desconocido Que tengan a unos docentes contratados y que no hagan acopio a a los problemas que pueda tener el el menor. ¿En este caso el en este momento está en algún tipo de tratamiento psicológico psiquiátrico a causa de ello? Bueno, el tiene su seguimiento en Taly. Yo estoy esperando a ver si consigo dar con su psiquiatra, porque dar con otro nuevo es para nada, es perder una hora entera porque tienes que volver a explicar todo el rato lo mismo. 00:10:42:19 - 00:11:26:27 Desconocido Sí, claro, naturalmente. Pero si están muy saturados. Quieta, Oliva, fatal Tali, que es porque en este es el Hospital de la Oscuridad de la Seguridad Social, donde lleva psiquiatría y psicología como un cap de si muere un cabrón en un hospital. Más que capos está el CAP, el centro de salud y el hospital que te bajas divergencias. Una es un hospital especializado dentro de lo que es el hospital, dentro de lo que es la rama de psiquiatría y psicología. 00:11:27:00 - 00:11:56:26 Desconocido No podríamos hacer. ¿Actor Sí, y está teniendo el seguimiento, el seguimiento por por el tema de la depresión, por el tema de de me imagino no? Pero por el tema de la depresión, porque el seguimiento, por por el tema del autismo también lo tendrá. Pero es una cosa diferente. Sí, lo tiene en el sentido de enseñarle a canalizar ese nervio y no hacer estas. 00:11:56:26 - 00:12:32:23 Desconocido Estereotipia es dañino. Es lo que está en internet, porque obviamente el autismo naces con él. ¿No? No es ninguna enfermedad que se pueda curar ni nada, por lo cual no es que le vayan a dar un tratamiento. Sí, técnicas de relajación es diferente. Vale, lo que hace es ir a grupos de como un grupo de terapia, podríamos decir, para enseñarle directamente a no autolesionarse debido a esos, esos movimientos es hiperactividad. 00:12:32:23 - 00:13:04:13 Desconocido No podríamos decir, pero yo quiero ir un poco más allá dentro de lo que es lo normal, que es lo que me estás contando. No es enseñanza para para que tenga una una vida mejor en cuestión de de no dañarse, no hacerse daño a raíz de lo que ha pasado en este colegio que le dicen o que le han dicho es que todavía no hemos conseguido contactar. 00:13:04:13 - 00:13:29:02 Desconocido ¿Quieres decir con su psiquiatra? Sí, con con un especialista que hayáis podido hablar sobre sobre el tema de la rabia no hemos podido hablar. Es que va muy mal y es el que nos toca. Y no, no podemos ir a otro, por así decirlo. Ya, pero es una situación de urgencia. Yo lo veo. ¿No? Sí, sí, pero que les da igual. 00:13:29:02 - 00:14:18:09 Desconocido Vaya, es que Talía va fatal, tiene muy buenos profesionales, pero el funcionamiento es pésimo. Bueno, pues como casi toda la sanidad, entonces no son profesionales y hay mucha lista de espera. Aunque tengas una urgencia. ¿Decías que habías denunciado también ante los Mossos d'Esquadra, no? Y los Mossos que que han dicho que acabarán Ensenyament igual que en todos sitios, porque al final enseña a menores como el el el que se encarga de esto se hace cualquier cosa que tú hagas, ya sea vía judicial, vía mossos, todo va a Ensenyament, vale, pero Ensenyament es una institución pública. 00:14:18:09 - 00:15:14:15 Desconocido ¿O si tú estás en Sabadell, que no existe Ensenyament, entonces hace ya pues el departamento de de colegios no? No lo sé, como se llamara, fuera de aquí, como si fuera educación. Aquí sí, en Madrid, por ejemplo, como si fuera un adaptación a la educación o alguna cosa, si eso. Y ahí se establece lo que es una queja referente a este, hasta este centro, que espero que se me había ido el nombre Ferran Casablancas hasta el centro, pero en Ensenyament, que es lo que hacen únicamente porque es la primera vez que fui, que fue cuando me avisaron. 00:15:14:18 - 00:16:18:25 Desconocido Me avisaron los jueves siendo el viaje el martes siguiente estando confirmado desde diciembre estamos hablando todo esto de ahora, esto de enero del mes de enero. ER Pues me avisan el jueves de que otro lo puede ir por bueno, según pone ahí constantes autolesiones, falta la autoridad y no sé que más. ER Bueno, sí, es una serie de cosas, sí, y que lo habían hecho siguiendo las indicaciones del capi, que es como el equipo psicológico del centro, que me hace especial gracia esto porque es un equipo psicológico que como que dice que mi hijo está muy mal en equipo psicológico, que mi hijo no ha visto en su vida entonces dentro, que no lo han 00:16:18:25 - 00:16:55:17 Desconocido visto psicológicamente para saber si está bien o mal. Pero yo ya te puedo decir directamente que que yo lo veo muy normal a tu hijo. Yo he tenido el gusto de poder verle y ver cómo se expresa, no referente a esa denuncia, a esa carta a la que a la que estás diciendo de que se auto lesionaba dentro de ese vídeo que está publicado en el TIC TOC, por ejemplo, se explica perfectamente y se ve a las personas que no sepan catalán, naturalmente no van a entender ni J. 00:16:55:17 - 00:17:21:15 Desconocido Pero lo explicáis tanto o vosotros no lo explicamos todo en castellano. El vídeo sí, no, pero. Pero el texto que había detrás estaban catalanes, pero lo leemos en castellano, Claro, es a lo que me refería, que lo que aunque el texto estuviera en catalán, lo estáis hablando en en castellano, lo estáis diciendo de esa forma. ¿Para, para que? 00:17:21:15 - 00:17:53:13 Desconocido Para dar ese ese tipo de visibilidad y estáis tanto tú como como tu hijo, en este caso explicando los problemas de tu hijo, diciendo esto es que no ha sido así, esto no pasó así, esto es una cosa que entonces es también un poco incomprensible la carta, yo me refiero a la carta o sea, no las explicaciones que hacéis vosotros, porque yo perfectamente entiendo catalán, porque yo he trabajado en Cataluña y se hablarlo perfectamente también. 00:17:53:15 - 00:18:42:10 Desconocido ¿Entonces yo la carta que la he visto, pues a mí me parece una locura, no? Lo que lo que pone dentro de ella, pero hacía referencia y hacía copio a las personas que no entiende catalán, catalán sí. Entonces dentro de lo que pone que ponía que se auto lesionaba y ponía algo de enero que no recuerdo ahora mismo tendría que ver el vídeo nuevamente sobre una fecha de enero que me imagino que sería estaría, que sería cuando, cuando, cuando iban a dejar ya de de que dejase de estudiar lo que le hace estudiar, no tener constancia. 00:18:42:12 - 00:19:32:21 Desconocido Me pareció ver alguna. ¿Sí, porque se acogieron a yo les llevé a un informe de psiquiatría de su psiquiatra donde ponía que él no era ni un peligro, porque el director lo que me dijo a mí como si fuera un psicópata que tenía toda la clase acojonada, eh? Bueno, barbaridades. Y en ese informe como cómo puede decir un director que tiene acojonada a la clase Si, porque en el viaje del País Vasco, que era él, el escolar que no ha ido, tenían que dormir de cinco en cinco, pues que estaban todos con miedo de que les tocara dormir con otro por si se hacía el daño o les hacía daño a alguien. 00:19:32:23 - 00:20:06:04 Desconocido Pero a ver si una de enero se agarra una cosa que pone en el informe que le presento yo de psiquiatría, donde pone que no existe ningún peligro, que pone, que se especifica en el informe que el alumno necesita soporte flexible de adulto para la organización de sus tareas instrumentales y asegurarse la toma correcta del tratamiento que esto viene a hacer, a decirle otro. 00:20:06:04 - 00:20:36:12 Desconocido ¿Te has acordado de tomarte las pastillas? Ya está ya. Un seguimiento que puede hacer un supervisor en este caso sería un un profesor, podríamos decir lo que lo que yo no entiendo es que dentro de un informe psiquiátrico diga que no hay peligro, porque es que realmente también una persona que sea autista no es agresivo. Hay casos en los que hay agresividad, pero en los casos que son demasiado graves. 00:20:36:14 - 00:21:22:20 Desconocido Pero es que directamente el la agresividad que tienen es autolesionarse ellos mismos. Bueno, hay de todo, porque yo sí que trabajo, claro que sí, hay de todo grado, pero otro es grado uno. Y aparte de todo esto, no tiene ninguna incapacidad intelectual. ¿De hecho es alta capacidades, eh? ¿Y cuando le dieron la discapacidad le otorgaron la tarjeta, digamos, le dieron un 37% basándose en sus notas y eran todas de excelente, pues porque tiene altas capacidades, sí, pero vale, es un grado uno que es un grado minoritario, no? 00:21:22:21 - 00:21:55:07 Desconocido ¿O sea, es un grado menor, eh? Yo por ejemplo, quien conozco tiene un grado más alto, pero tampoco ha sido agredido. Lo único bueno, lo máximo que ha hecho son morderme a mí, pero no es una cosa así, que vaya a hacerlo también. Dependiendo Luego ya va a un centro especializado, está este chico, a un centro especializado, el tuyo va a un centro de inclusión y justamente estás diciendo las notas que son excelentes. 00:21:55:09 - 00:22:24:25 Desconocido Lo único que tiene el déficit de atención en el que tiene que tener un recordatorio de lo que se tenga que tomar, pero ya de ahí que ya lo etiqueten, no como como una persona agresiva, que que todo el mundo le tenga miedo porque pueda hacer daño a alguien o hacerse daño. El mismo podríamos decir, me parece una excusa un poco idiota. 00:22:24:27 - 00:23:04:07 Desconocido Sí, totalmente. ¿Y más yendo de la mano con un informe de de al día siguiente, que era cuando le tocó la última, la última palabra del discurso que tuvo su Y de hecho, para más muestra el año pasado en el otro instituto que no pudo seguir porque no había artístico ahí, ya que artísticos hay pocos, eh? ¿Es el Arrahona que también lo quiero mencionar porque trataron a mi hijo fenomenal, o sea, una pasada eh? 00:23:04:14 - 00:23:36:13 Desconocido Se fue a Roma por sus compañeros, como cualquier chico normal y no pasó absolutamente nada. Bueno, no tiene porque pasar nada. Y además descubrió Roma, que es precioso totalmente, que es una maravilla. ¿Pues mira, pues ahí por ejemplo, este instituto dentro de lo que cabe también es de Sabadell o es algo ahí sí, y porque por qué lo sacaste de allí si estaba bien? 00:23:36:16 - 00:24:22:23 Desconocido ¿Porque lo hace en el bachillerato que quería hacer mi hijo de artístico, vale? ¿O sea, entonces se tuvo que cambiar a este otro instituto por por este tema, pero yo creo que más vale lo bueno conocido que lo malo por conocer, no? Entonces bueno, si el chico, por ejemplo, que quiere estudiar algo artístico y no, no lo aceptan, pero es que también debería de tener un poco más de de empatía, podríamos decir en el Ferran Casa Casablancas, porque me parece patético todo lo que están haciendo con tu hijo y a ti también te está afectando bastante. 00:24:22:25 - 00:24:54:24 Desconocido Hombre, a mí me está afectando muchísimo. Ahora mismo estoy de baja, tengo una tienda, la tengo cerrada ya que soy la la única persona de la clase de 9 de enero. Exactamente. Yo estoy con depresión mayor, con trastorno de ansiedad y. Y es que no puedo me a o sea, ir a buscar a mi pequeña al colegio. Me supone un esfuerzo increíble. 00:24:54:26 - 00:25:29:02 Desconocido Sea el tema también de salir a la calle, por ejemplo, y más teniendo un trastorno ansioso o depresivo mayor en el en el cual quedas anulada directamente. No sé si estás tú también en tratamiento psiquiátrico y es psicológico y todo a raíz de un sistema educativo que no se está haciendo cargo de de lo que ocurre en el Ferran Casablancas. 00:25:29:04 - 00:25:55:19 Desconocido Esa. Y es que hay un problema muy grande con bueno, de hecho se ha puesto en contacto otra mamá del mismo centro que su hijo, también es autista, un grado como el de mi hijo, que también quería denunciarlo. Le he dicho que viniera para hacer la entrevista, pero tenía médico y tal. No ha podido. Pero para Ensenyament si queremos las dos juntas. 00:25:55:22 - 00:26:24:15 Desconocido Y hay otra mamá más que también. Pero por el tema de de no respetar el pronombre de su hijo trans tampoco es otra madre dentro del mismo centro que tiene el mismo problema que tú, más otra madre que tiene a un hijo hija que sea transexual, un bueno es un padre. Mentira que la madre decía si es que siempre me lío. 00:26:24:18 - 00:26:59:12 Desconocido Es el padre, sí. O sea que no es el único caso, el de tu hijo. Hay varios y me han hablado más casos por privado, que es que yo he alucinado de lo mal que les han tratado psicológicamente, pero ya no hablando de personas neuro divergente, sino de personas neurotípicos. O sea, como nosotros, que le han destrozado la salud mental y lo que han hecho ha sido dejar los estudios por cambiar de centro o dejarlo y hasta y y hasta. 00:26:59:12 - 00:27:30:12 Desconocido Y yo he dicho pues yo no me voy a callar, no me da la gana, porque hay un problema muy grave que estos niños de TEA uno son como muy especiales para un centro normal, pero muy normales para un centro especial. No hay un centro realmente, para ellos no lo existe, no existe. A ver o existir no existen naturalmente. 00:27:30:14 - 00:28:04:11 Desconocido Cuando una persona es neuro divergente, en este caso tiene que ir a un centro específico y especial basado en empresas, en personas con las mismas capacidades cognitivas. ¿Pero entonces para que existen los los institutos o los colegios de inclusión? ¿Porque se supone que esas actividades o ese mecanismo es totalmente adaptable? ¿No a las necesidades, en este caso de tu hijo, de las otras personas? 00:28:04:14 - 00:28:33:23 Desconocido Sí, sí. De hecho, cuando lo apunté hice una primera reunión antes de que empezara el colegio con su tutor. Le llevé todo los informes de mi hijo e le llevé su día, sus diagnósticos. Le expliqué el tema de su transición para que en las listas pusieran el nombre de otro puesto que todavía no tenía el DNI cambiado, que ya sí lo tienen. 00:28:33:26 - 00:29:14:06 Desconocido Y la respuesta fue que no había ningún problema, que tenían un equipo especializado en TEA. ¿Y yo, claro, me quedé tranquila de decir pues fenomenal, no? Pero ya ves que dentro de lo que hay no hay TDAH por ningún lado, no hay ningún equipo especializado y encima el director un poco incompetente. Sí, ya, ya he tenido dos dos reuniones con él y he los no, no, no sé ni que decir la verdad. 00:29:14:09 - 00:30:05:22 Desconocido Puedes decir lo que quieras porque aquí no hay ningún tipo de censura. ¿Lamentable lo que lo que ocurre directamente en en este caso, ya que hay varias familias que están con un problema parecido al alto, yo directamente una denuncia colectiva, un no sería funcional si es que hoy se ha puesto en contacto conmigo eh? Pues al poquito de de hablarnos se ha puesto en contacto la la mamá del del nene autista y a través de TIC toc se puso en contacto conmigo el nene trans de que no le respetaban sus pronombres. 00:30:05:22 - 00:30:38:09 Desconocido Claro, yo no sabía si él tenía el apoyo de de sus padres si no y el crío me dijo que sí. Digo pues dile a tu padre que vaya al cole, que lo hable, no, si es que eso ya lo ha hecho y pasan de todo. Entonces me quiero poner en contacto con el papá del nene. Pero realmente, o sea, en este caso, este trance del que me estás hablando, solamente tienes que esta diferencia no es autista. 00:30:38:12 - 00:31:31:15 Desconocido Sí lo es, porque es trans y lo trata mejor. ¿Es que una persona trans lo pasan muy mal, no? Yo no te sé decir cuanto, pues porque no lo vivo, pero yo veo llorar a mi hijo constantemente por ese tema y lo veo sufrir y lo veo la disforia que tiene con su cuerpo no lo creo que sea de buen gusto en absoluto, es un cuerpo que no le pertenece directamente, entonces tiene ese problema y para eso bueno pues hay psicólogos especialistas a los cuales cuando, cuando están en proceso de transformación se les va adaptando y enseñando a que su cuerpo va a cambiar, pero que tiene que tener un poquito de paciencia para que 00:31:31:17 - 00:32:20:11 Desconocido ¿que las cosas funcionen, no? Que para eso existen lo que son las hormonas y la hormona y demás, pero ya que haya transfobia dentro de un colegio, por ejemplo, no solamente por el caso de tu hijo, sino por otro caso que es otro otro nene, ya claramente vemos ahí un transfobia en un hospital, pero si yo te iba a preguntar si es un colegio católico y no, no, porque yo soy totalmente atea, jamás lo apuntaría a un colegio católico, es más o menos porque me parecía, o sea, me parece más que un colegio, o sea normal, de un colegio católico. 00:32:20:13 - 00:33:06:24 Desconocido Puede ser también incluso que dentro de lo que es la dirección del centro o el profesorado o los docentes, con el trato que están recibiendo, que están dando perdón hacia tu hijo en este caso y hacia los demás. El el centro no solamente se centre, que a lo mejor por el tema de la inclusividad por el TEA no, pero creo que a lo mejor puede llegar a eso una simple reflexión mía que puede llegar un poquito más allá, no sólo por el TEA, sino ya por un PO, por el tema de del cambio de sexo. 00:33:06:27 - 00:33:58:28 Desconocido Si eso, eso, eso pienso. ¿No sé, es que yo no lo no lo veo lógica, no? Porque sí. Me imagino que antes de entrar al centro, como bien decías, se hace un examen, se hace una valoración, no para para ver que capacidades puede tener en no sé si no me acuerdo si se lo has mencionado, que antes del cambio ya estaba, entras en otra sección, o sea, están tras función en el sentido simplemente del DNI, porque para poder hormonal se necesita autorización de ambos progenitores y su padre, del cual estoy separada, está totalmente en contra. 00:33:59:01 - 00:34:29:20 Desconocido Entonces la transición que está haciendo, pues es la que puede llevar Binder, que es una especie de todo para aplanar el pecho y y poco más, porque es que mucho más no puede hacer. Le hemos hecho el cambio del DNI y ya está. Apoyarlo, acompañarlo, animarlo y poco más. ¿Transición puede hacer hasta los 18? Sí, pero me refería a lo del padre. 00:34:29:20 - 00:35:00:10 Desconocido Me parece una vergüenza también, porque yo creo que un padre tiene que aceptar a un hija, hija e hija. No vamos a usar los tres pronombres porque cada cada persona se define de una manera diferente. Entonces, dentro de esos tres tu hijo decidió ser chico y ha sido rechazado por su padre. Es una cosa que lo veo una falta de ética y una falta de moral por su parte. 00:35:00:12 - 00:35:27:21 Desconocido Pero la pregunta que yo te hacía referente a lo del centro es si el centro ya sabía que no en la transición directamente de hormonas no, porque como bien dices tiene que ser, al ser un menor de edad tiene que haber una forma de los de los dos progenitores, cosa que no ha habido. Otra cosa es el DNI que a partir de los 16 años ya se puede hacer sin ningún tipo de firma. 00:35:27:23 - 00:36:18:07 Desconocido Entonces el centro yo sabía que había una transición, no sé que que otro es otro. Sí, sí, obviamente sí, porque una de las cosas también por las que quise hacer la primera reunión, porque ya para bachiller llerato no se hacen reuniones así, porque ya representa que son mayores y tal. Y yo le dije que bueno, pues que mi hijo tenía una as especialidades si lo quieren llamar así y que yo necesitaba hacer esa reunión con urgencia y al final pues se hizo la reunión y le expliqué el tema de su disforia, el tema del nombre, el tema de otro y otro sí que le llaman, pero por ejemplo me me comentó mi hijo que el 00:36:18:07 - 00:36:49:01 Desconocido ¿primer día de una clase nada más empezar, pues la típica pregunta de por qué has escogido el bachillerato artístico? Y le dijo porque quiero ser ilustrador. Y la profesora le increpaba diciendo ilustrador. Y él le increpaba ilustrador. Y así varias veces, hasta que la profesora le dijo Bueno, lo que seas ya está. Así de mala manera. ¿En serio? 00:36:49:04 - 00:37:15:04 Desconocido Sí. No se ha tomado ningún tipo de medida contra esa profesora. Es que el problema que todo esto yo no lo sabía. Mi hijo que dicen que los autistas no tienen empatía. Totalmente mentira al ver que yo estoy con depresión, que mi depresión viene de antes, pero que esto la ha agravado mucho más. Obviamente he no me contaba nada. 00:37:15:04 - 00:37:57:26 Desconocido ¿Cómo te ha ido Olinsky? Bien. O tengo, estoy o como mucho estoy muy agobiado porque me veo que no llego con tantos deberes y cosas así. Y luego también como que normalizó mucho el tema de transfobia. Lo acabó. Yo creo que eran tantos los casos que lo acabó asumiendo, asimilando, normalizando y cuando e hice como un comunicado para avisar al centro de que iba a tomar unas medidas, le pregunté a mi hijo dime todo lo que si te han pasado alguna, alguna cosa más que no me hayan dicho. 00:37:57:27 - 00:38:27:01 Desconocido ¿Cuando me empezó a contar, yo me quede horrorizada, digo pero es que por qué no me lo has dicho antes? ¿O ya es que estoy alucinando? Ya es, es que directamente a mi me parece, me parece un poco. ¿O sea, en este caso tendría que ser denunciable, no? El trato de decir ella cuando cuando es él y hay que dirigirse de esa forma, no como él. 00:38:27:03 - 00:39:35:20 Desconocido Y no sé, o sea, yo denunciaría directamente a tanto al centro como al profesor. Como el director, yo denunciaría, tocaréis. Entonces ha denunciado todo. O sea, es que está todo, es que voy, voy en contra de todos directamente, que directamente el trato es sumamente vejatorio, homófobo. Bueno, en este caso tras mofo, pero. Pero vamos. Y la pillaron siendo que un centro educativo y un docente en este caso sabiendo que es otro y le diga ella no refiriéndose como como ella no y la profesora y eso es disforia, sí, y la profesora que me comenta que mejor le trata constantemente, le trata en femenino y le le repite no soy él no le responde. 00:39:35:22 - 00:40:12:29 Desconocido Y la respuesta al perdona es que con tu cara y tu voz me me lío, me confundes. ¿Cómo le puedes decir eso a una persona que que lo está pasando fatal? ¿Pero es que eso directamente lo que están haciendo es herirle de una forma sobrehumana, o sea, están jugando con con, con él, no? O sea, ya le está poniendo una etiqueta, o sea, me refiero a ti, porque es que con tu cara, con tu cuerpo, o sea, directamente. 00:40:13:06 - 00:41:12:25 Desconocido Vamos a ver, señoras y señores, no se puede, se puede realizar lo que es una transformación, porque el padre no quiere o o no quiere firmar para que se haga el el la transformación del cuerpo de de femenino masculino, cosa que también le producen mucho, muchísimo problema. El pero luego ya indirectamente la mala fe de las personas, no en este caso un docente dirigiéndose claro a otro corrige y dice no soy él y dice bueno, ya me da igual, porque es que con la cara y el cuerpo pues mira, yo te voy a decir una cosa porque yo sí he visto a tu hijo, naturalmente tiene tiene la voz aguda, pero a ver, porque no 00:41:12:25 - 00:41:49:28 Desconocido está hormonados, que es la cosa más normal del mundo. Pero, pero luego a ver reacciones femeninas a lo único que se le ve directamente, pues es el tema de la expresión, no cuando cuando se expresa directamente es la voz. Pero eso no tiene porque etiquetarse. Mira, te voy a ser sincero, porque yo la primera vez que vi a tu hijo, porque yo no sabía la historia, no, naturalmente, yo vi el vídeo y tampoco presté atención. 00:41:49:28 - 00:42:19:05 Desconocido Estaba más atento a lo que a lo que estabas diciendo tú y yo, claro, escuchaba a tu hijo hablar. Digo, yo creo que es gay. ¿Sabes? O sea, yo veía a un chico, pero yo veía a un chico gay. Y luego, claro, cuando me has contado que. ¿Que que era? Era transexual, pues. Pues entonces ya dije bueno, ahora entiendo ciertas cosas. 00:42:19:07 - 00:42:52:16 Desconocido ¿No? Porque se me aparece un chico, o sea, dentro de lo que cabe es visto como un chico, tiene aspecto de chico, pero es que lo que hay es que esta sociedad tiene que concienciar, concienciarse en que existen niños con vulva y niñas con pene. O sea que que un genital no, no, no dicta lo que tú eres. 00:42:52:18 - 00:43:22:21 Desconocido Es que realmente la concienciación como yo pienso que que directamente la tienen que dar los padres, no los padres a los a las personas. ¿Porque si por ejemplo tú en este caso eres eres una persona luchadora, eres valiente, no has aceptado a tu hijo tal como es cuando te ha dicho yo no quiero ser chica que seas chico y has aceptado, lo has valorado como como madre, no? 00:43:22:22 - 00:43:56:06 Desconocido Que es una cosa que que que voy a hacer siempre hincapié en este sentido de que la madre siempre es la que lleva la carga, que el padre únicamente plantar las semillas no sirve para nada, que aunque sea vital. Pero hay veces que los padres son enseñados de una forma en la cual no aceptan a sus hijos, sea del sexo que sean, o la condición sexual que tengan indirectamente también tengo que decir que hay madres, pero hay muchísimos, muy poquitos casos de madres más, más de padres que de madres. 00:43:56:08 - 00:44:37:02 Desconocido Entonces yo creo que pero fíjate que estamos en el siglo 21 y normalmente las personas que que ya tienen una edad o juvenil no, o sea que podríamos decir que que nuestros padres ya están metidos dentro de lo que es una ilusión y deberían de haber enseñado o inculcado un valor sobre sobre nosotros, para, para, para el respeto o el respeto hacia hacia, hacia una persona que que sea entre comillas. 00:44:37:02 - 00:45:08:02 Desconocido Quiero recalcar entre comillas porque para mí no hay diferencia ninguna, no, sino espero en este caso entre comillas, una persona diferente porque antes era chica y ahora quiere ser chico. Yo no veo ninguna diferencia en eso, sinceramente. Yo veo es que es una persona una persona que no se siente a gusto con su cuerpo y quiere cambiar su cuerpo, ya está y está siendo etiquetado de mala forma, totalmente. 00:45:08:04 - 00:45:41:00 Desconocido Entonces, dentro de lo que lo que veo es que la inclusión ni siquiera en lo que es un centro como, como es el caso de este centro del Ferran Ferran Casablanca que está en Sabadell, recordemos todos yo no llevaré a mi hijo ahí. En el caso de que yo tuviera hijos, claro, si no, no lo veo buen centro. 00:45:41:00 - 00:46:09:00 Desconocido ¿No? Sinceramente no, hombre, es que ya con los casos que has comentado no ya tres personas no ya saber si hay más personas dentro de lo que me dices, que habrá más personas que quizá no tengan o la valentía de explicarlo a los padres, o que piensen que los padres no les van a apoyar o que los padres no les apoyen. 00:46:09:08 - 00:47:03:28 Desconocido Es que como cada familia es un mundo, pues seguramente se procesan acompasando las de Neil. Pero es lo que decíamos anteriormente, que dentro de lo que es la familia es lo que le hayan enseñado a sus padres cuando han sido pequeños, que inclusión le han dado dentro de lo que es la sociedad. Pero por ejemplo yo creo que mis padres por ejemplo son muy inclusivos en ese sentido y no ha habido nunca ningún problema en cuestión de inclusividad con con nadie de la familia, ni ni ninguna cosa así porque pero sí te puedo decir que por parte de los abuelos pues se ve un poquito mal, pero hay que entender también que ellos han vivido 00:47:03:28 - 00:47:43:11 Desconocido en otra época y otras situaciones, pero ya los de la generación nueva como que han vivido ya un episodio en la cual deberían de estar acostumbrados a ver a los hombres besarse, las mujeres besarse, a ver a una persona que antes se llamaba Raúl y ahora se llama Fátima, por ejemplo. No, yo creo que deberían de de valorar muchas cosas y pensar sobre todo en el daño que le pueden hacer a la persona en sí con esas degradaciones que realizan en este caso, pues a raíz de la transexualidad. 00:47:43:14 - 00:48:20:03 Desconocido Y vuelvo a repetir nuevamente en un centro educativo, yo no sé los profesores que edad tendrán, no sé si es el centro público, cerrarán, Casa Blanca, tendrá profesores muy mayores o los que los que he visto. De hecho vi una que parecía que era más joven que yo. Yo le echaría, no sé, como que acababa de acabar la carrera de magisterio súper jovencita, luego de 40 y algo, o tal vez cosa así. 00:48:20:04 - 00:49:15:11 Desconocido Tampoco es que hayan abuelitos, o sea que no hay, no hay un profesores que sean mayores. Algún abuelo imagino, pero los que yo he visto no, no eran muy mayores tampoco, la verdad. Um. Sí. ¿Pues me parece también súper raro, no? Porque dentro ya de una formación que les dan académicamente, cuando cuando ellos estudian la docencia, les enseñan lo que es la inclusividad, pero es lo que lo que yo digo, que a lo mejor mucho tema de educación, porque se han sacado una carrera, pero luego que no tienen tipo de conexión no tienen ninguna y es lo que han demostrado que no tienen ni educación, ni empatía, ni humanidad. 00:49:15:13 - 00:49:53:15 Desconocido Hombre, es que es infrahumano. O sea, el daño que te están haciendo a ti y están haciendo a tu hijo me parece, me parece muy increíble. Yo Antes de preparar la entrevista estuvimos hablando ciertas cosas en privado y yo estaba muy muy cabreado. Yo me cabreé bastante y lo veo súper, súper injusto todo, o sea, todo lo que está sufriendo, tanto tú como madre como tu hijo por el tema. 00:49:53:17 - 00:50:28:20 Desconocido Pero fíjate que tu hijo tanto que dicen me da miedo, no me da miedo porque me puede agredir, no quiero dormir con él y te protege. O sea, ahí se demuestra, por ejemplo un gran valor, no de que esconde lo que le está pasando en el colegio, porque tú que tienes depresión desde hace tiempo, me imagino que a raíz de tu ex pareja te protege para que no te sientas aún peor. 00:50:28:23 - 00:50:59:09 Desconocido Exacto. Eso de que los autistas no tienen empatía es un mito y es totalmente erróneo porque si tienen empatía quizá no la demuestren igual que nosotros, pero sí que la tiene. A ver, el tema, el teorema, el tema de la empatía. ¿Yo con con todos las personas autistas no, que además es que no me gusta tampoco llamarles autistas, pero bueno, es el término coloquial, no? 00:50:59:12 - 00:51:38:26 Desconocido Del cual siempre los vamos a hacer referencia. Y no me gusta etiquetar a las personas porque para mí todos son iguales. El tema de la empatía lo que dice es que a lo mejor no lo demuestran también dependiendo del grado, pero siempre muestran siempre muestran ese cariño de una forma u otra. Pues como yo te decía, yo conozco a un chico autista que no habla y yo me puse a leer sobre el autismo y dentro de lo que es el autismo, yo me comunico con este niño que en este caso es un niño. 00:51:38:29 - 00:52:07:09 Desconocido ¿Me comunicó a través de gestos, no? Y bueno, alguna palabra ha dicho y también hacerlo de lo que decías así de los movimientos, así que eso es muy de autista y porque son muy hiperactivos. Lo que pasa es que mucha gente no entiende tampoco lo del autismo, porque el autismo para para mucha gente es un retraso mental y no tiene nada que ver con un retraso mental. 00:52:07:11 - 00:52:45:02 Desconocido No es el el campo del autismo es muy amplio y muy grande. Puede sí que pueden tener retrasos mentales, como que pueden tener altas capacidades. Es que es como si metiéramos a todos los discapacitados físicos en el mismo saco. Claro, pero cuando falta una pierna, otro un brazo es claro, es, es, es, es, es, es una comparación, por ejemplo, es que la gente tiende a etiquetar sin saber sobre, sobre qué tema o sobre qué patología. 00:52:45:02 - 00:53:07:29 Desconocido No, porque por ejemplo, si es si ya un autismo a tener cierto retraso. Que sí, que hay algunos que tienen algún algún retraso, pero no es una deficiencia, es más déficit de atención que otra cosa. Pero por ejemplo, una persona con síndrome de Down, también hay personas con síndrome de Down que ya estamos hablando de algo muy grave. 00:53:07:29 - 00:53:55:08 Desconocido ¿No? ¿Y ellos son docentes, tienen sus carreras, por qué no un autista o una persona autista? De hecho, dicen en muchas ocasiones que una persona autista es luego un psicópata. ¿O sea, es que creo que hay que dar a entender a la gente que una persona autista es una persona normal y que no se va a volver psicópata, que se va a volver psicópata en el caso de que tenga una experiencia que le puede traumatizar y ya entre la psicopatía en la persona, pero también dependiendo de lo que es la educación de de de sus padres, la educación que les que les inculcan y de lo que estén viviendo, no? 00:53:55:10 - 00:54:28:24 Desconocido Pero yo creo que que todas estas cosas que he dicho son mitos, no lo veo como real. Realmente esto es así, tal vez no lo veo, no lo veo como real, de hecho es que no me gusta. ¿Referente al al centro, habéis tenido algún tipo más de contestación? ¿Porque desde luego desde cuando no va no va al centro? 00:54:28:26 - 00:55:00:11 Desconocido Pues desde que lo fui a buscar el jueves que me habló en un intercambio de clase que ya se notaba una muchísima ansiedad y yo creo que quiso prevenir de que no le diera un ataque de ansiedad. Y me habló a mí porque ya no se siente con con ganas, con esa como te digo, no se siente seguro para decírselo a ningún profesor. 00:55:00:11 - 00:55:23:28 Desconocido Ya de oye, que me encuentro mal, llamo a mi madre. Entonces cogió, me habló él en un cambio de clase y fui a buscarlo. Y de hecho la profesora le habló, no pensó que yo era su madre y le habló delante mío súper mal y yo le respondía ella pues de la misma manera que le había hablado a él, vaya. 00:55:24:00 - 00:55:52:03 Desconocido Y yendo yo a buscar, firmando la hoja que te dan conforme te lo lleva, porque está malo y tal. El resto del día le siguieron poniendo faltas injustificadas. Bueno, que no es la primera vez, pero bueno. Pero es que ahí estamos viendo. O sea, en primer lugar la profesora que no sabía que tú, la madre, lo está tratando mal delante de ti. 00:55:52:06 - 00:56:28:27 Desconocido Si, y que como actuaste en ese caso con contra la profesora, porque es que realmente yo. Yo. Mira, se me están. Me están entrando unas ideas horribles. Si yo fuera tú, iría con el teléfono todo el tiempo, grabando conversaciones cada vez que voy al centro. Ya, es que. Es que es. Es que es horroroso, es que es una frustración y una indignación y de todo, es que. 00:56:29:00 - 00:57:00:29 Desconocido Ya, pero. ¿Pero dentro de lo que es la frustración y la indignación, como reaccionaste con contra esa profesora, por ejemplo? Pues ella le dijo o le dijo o me puedo bajar como a conserjería, que es donde yo lo esperaba, que está ahí mi madre y dice yo te acompaño, pero de malas maneras me dijo, y me lo creo porque es que vi cómo le hablaba y le dije está mi madre aquí ya dentro de conserjería. 00:57:01:01 - 00:57:25:01 Desconocido Yo creo que miro y soy muy chiquitita, mido uno 50 igual, pues no me hizo de su madre yo creo y le dijo pero alzando bastante la voz y muy borde miente. No, no, no, tú vete a la sala esa de no sé qué y te esperas ahí sentado. Y entonces yo le respondí No, no, él se viene conmigo que soy su madre y nos vamos ya, madre mía. 00:57:25:03 - 00:57:50:00 Desconocido Entonces ella le respondió ya bajo el tonito y dijo ah, vale. Digo vale, claro, ya, ya, sabiendo que está la autoridad ahí, pues que creo que se le pondrían los pelos de punta a esa profesora, no al al ver que tú, que yo era bastante con todo lo que he visto que está haciendo ese centro, dudo que se les pongan los pelos de punta de nada. 00:57:50:00 - 00:58:23:00 Desconocido Yo creo que no tienen vergüenza ninguno. Sinceramente, yo sigo insistiendo directamente en lo que tendría que haber una denuncia colectiva por parte de de todos los afectados que sois y la máxima visibilidad no a través de redes sociales si es lo que lo está intentando por todos los medios, porque encima es que desde el día 1 no porque decías del jueves estamos a 6 de febrero, desde el día 1 es cuando no va al colegio, con lo cual está perdiendo días de educación. 00:58:23:03 - 00:58:49:26 Desconocido También, dijo, dijo en una ocasión que estaba en una clase que necesitaba ir al servicio porque estaba descompuesto y no le dejaban ir al servicio. Sí, sí, no le dijeron que no y pues él se fue corriendo obviamente porque se lo iba a meter sus necesidades encima y por eso es lo que pone aquí en el correo, como que falta a la autoridad o algo así. 00:58:49:26 - 00:59:11:06 Desconocido ¿No respeto a la autoridad, como que no respeta la autoridad, pero qué autoridad hay ahí? Si la única autoridad es un policía que no estamos en los años 70 ni en los años 80, cuando los profesores eran autoritarios y nos tenemos que levantar incluso de no sé si tú has vivido eso, pero yo sí. Yo cuando iba al colegio me tenía que levantar cada vez que entraba un profesor. 00:59:11:08 - 00:59:44:03 Desconocido Bueno, yo sí, pero porque fui a uno concertado de monjas y aparte de eso, tenemos que respetar también. Sí, a la mujer también. Pero bueno, dentro de lo que es no son considerados ninguna autoridad, o sea, son nuestros tutores. O sea, podríamos decir que son tutores legales dentro de lo que cabe, pero de turno tuve ganas de llevarme una una llamada constantemente que te está entrando. 00:59:44:03 - 01:00:23:00 Desconocido Una llamada constantemente. ¿Sí, sí, vale, no te preocupes, Yo cuando como veo que se va, se van en alguna ocasión la señal, pero me has escuchado lo que quiero decir no? O sea que no sé qué autoridad es si un docente, porque para mí no es ninguna autoridad, es una persona que está enseñando a alguien, pero no a alguien autoritario, que para ya la autoridad, pues ya están las autoridades competentes, en este caso en Cataluña, los Mossos d'Esquadra y ella y los mismos padres son los autoritarios, pero no una tercera persona. 01:00:23:03 - 01:00:53:19 Desconocido Pues no sé, no sé si es que este instituto se ha quedado en la época de Franco y no, no ha llegado a este año. Bueno, eso. ¿Por eso te preguntaba antes que si era un colegio católico, no? Porque mira, tú y yo hemos coincidido en algo en que sea un colegio de monjas. No sé qué edad tienes tú, pero bueno, yo tengo, yo tengo 44 y a mí me hacían Ya te digo que levantarme de la silla y como si fueran ahí. 01:00:53:21 - 01:01:21:09 Desconocido Sí, el trato también era un poco horroroso y bastante hostil. En mi caso, por lo menos en el mío, El mío no, el mío bastante fuerte podríamos decir. Bueno, hostil, también hostil. Y encima que soy zurdo y me crearon una una dislexia, porque si lo hago con la mano derecha me ataban la mano derecha contra contra la espalda. 01:01:21:15 - 01:01:47:16 Desconocido Pero bueno, son. Son épocas en las que se permitía hasta dar collejas y capones y cosas así. Ahora no está muy permitido ni permitido, pero yo creo que hay ciertas cosas que no se tienen que permitir, como es el trato que está recibiendo tu hijo y varias personas más de este centro. Ferrán Casanova, Ferran Casanova, Sabadell. Es horrible. 01:01:47:16 - 01:02:18:18 Desconocido Exacto. Es que no hace falta que te den un capón o un guantazo porque el maltrato psicológico puede hacer mucho más daño que un guantazo. Y las secuelas que que le puede dejar son son fatales porque de hecho ya no quiere. No se ve competente para un bachillerato y ahora ya estamos buscando ciclos de grado medio de artístico. 01:02:18:18 - 01:02:48:06 Desconocido También el bachillerato tendría que hacer en ese mismo centro, no es que a ese mismo centro él ya no quiere volver, o sea, ya tiene miedo a los compañeros, miedo a los profesores. Hombre, claro, si te están haciendo el vacío, te están haciendo bullying, te están diciendo cosas, transformas constantemente, es te discriminan, te marginan. ¿Tú querrías estar en un sitio así? 01:02:48:06 - 01:03:26:08 Desconocido Y creo que nadie como naturalmente, o sea, dentro de dentro de lo que de lo que es la psicología que te está recibiendo tu hijo por parte de ese centro. Lo que pasa es que que yo por eso digo, no sé si al bachiller luego lo hacen dentro de ese mismo centro y no hay alguna otra alternativa. Estabas diciendo algún algún grado no, pero dentro, si es que a mí se me quitaron las ganas de ser del arte y del todo directamente con lo que estoy, con lo que estaría sufriendo. 01:03:26:08 - 01:03:53:16 Desconocido Yo es que el problema que yo tengo es que me meto mucho en el en en cómo pensar a la otra persona, entonces es como que se como que lo estoy viviendo directamente, lo que lo que puede sentir tu hijo, no en este caso. Y mi pregunta entiendo el miedo también, claro, el miedo a los profesores, el miedo a a a los alumnos. 01:03:53:19 - 01:04:30:15 Desconocido Pero si él quiere estudiar esa carrera tiene que empezar un bachiller. ¿No hay un centro en Sabadell donde pueda estudiar esa carrera que no sea ese, eh? ¿Hay otro? Sí, hay otro sitio que hacen el bachillerato artístico, pero ha sido tanto el machaque psicológico que le han hecho de hacerle sentir inferior, que le han quitado la ilusión. Lo que te digo que ya no se ve capacitado para el bachillerato y ya quiere ir a un grado medio. 01:04:30:18 - 01:05:02:14 Desconocido Bueno, para el grado medio va a ser lo mismo, o sea, va a estar con con gente, va a estar con, con, con también profesores, con lo cual va a ser lo mismo. Yo directamente estar en otro centro. Si está en el centro, pero por eso te preguntaba que el bachiller creo que lo estudié en otro centro, no en otro centro que no tenga que ver con el Ferrán Casablanca. 01:05:02:16 - 01:05:30:09 Desconocido Sí, pero no quiere ya bachillerato. Es como que no lo sé. Lo han traumatizado con el bachillerato. Bueno, tal como lo han tratado es que es normal que lo traumatizan. O sea, es que han. Mira, nosotros llegamos a este, a este mundo para. Para cumplir una misión, la misiones, vivir nuestra vida, estudiar que es nuestro primer trabajo y encima no lo cobramos. 01:05:30:11 - 01:06:02:00 Desconocido Hay veces que en alguna ocasión lo lo pagamos nosotros mismos. Luego seguir estudiando para intentar sacarte una carrera y ser algo en la vida, trabajar y en algunos casos muchos trabajos que no tienen nada que ver con lo que tú has estudiado y jubilarte y ya está. Ese es el sentido de la vida y ese es el cumplimiento que tendríamos que tener todos, pero sea con el problema que tengamos. 01:06:02:00 - 01:06:33:16 Desconocido ¿Aunque bueno, vuelvo a recalcar que yo no veo ningún problema en que tu hijo tenga una patología que es un TEA, pero el problema lo tienen los que vendrás de fuera, no? O que no conocen a tu hijo, no lo conocen únicamente de manera estudiantil, que incluso has dicho que saca buenas notas, que ya con el trauma que tiene el chico directamente yo sacaría ceros. 01:06:33:18 - 01:07:05:23 Desconocido ¿Te lo digo en serio, no? En primero de bachillerato sí que han sacado muy malas notas. El tema de las buenas notas me refería a cuando le le dieron la discapacidad se basaron en sus notas y ahí era todo excelentes y entonces pues por eso le dieron un 37%, sumándole el déficit de atención, la imperatividad alto grado y el autismo. 01:07:05:25 - 01:07:31:09 Desconocido Sí, pero dentro de lo que de lo que estábamos hablando. No has dicho lo de lo de las notas, no las notas, que es algo muy importante y ya con déficit de atención e hiperactividad. ¿Cuando la persona es hiperactiva y tiene déficit de atención que que no aprende de una forma rápida y aun así saca buenas notas con buenas notas no? 01:07:31:11 - 01:08:05:03 Desconocido Y de ahí en cosa ya de sacar buenas notas en primero de bachillerato, pues ya ha sido lo peor. En cuestión de notificación, pero quizás por lo herido que se sienta, no realmente a raíz del trato vejatorio por parte de los docentes y por parte de este centro. Y ya con lo de la cartita de favor no a la carta, eso es que es para ponerla en un museo directamente. 01:08:05:05 - 01:08:36:18 Desconocido Bueno, y la conversación con el director es que parecía que hablaba, no lo sé, de Bin Laden, no de mí o yo. Yo es que me quedé alucinada, pero es que alucinada porque hubieron dos conversaciones en la revista Tu hijo. Sí, sí, o sea. Pero es que flipante la conversación, alucinante. Que era un peligro que ellos no podían cargar con ese peligro. 01:08:36:18 - 01:09:16:18 Desconocido El peligro número uno. Y yo diciendo peligro número uno. Pues sí, yo le dije contacta con el otro centro, con el Arrahona, pregúntales, pregúntale como fue el viaje a Roma Si quieres te paso el número de psiquiatría y contacta con ellos. Nada. ¿O sea no, o sea, pero y a ti? ¿A ti cómo? Como cuando tú hablas con un director y que te dice que es el peligro número uno más, más la de las degradaciones que haya tenido, que habrían grabado también la conversación en ese. 01:09:16:25 - 01:09:53:04 Desconocido En ese sentido, yo grabé la segunda por todo lo que escuché en la primera, pero la segunda no sé si algo se olía porque se iba un poco. Contradice en uno. Ya no fue lo mismo, ya no era peligro en la segunda y sí seguía siendo peligro. ¿Pero en el tema de claro, yo le iba diciendo hombre, el otro día me estuviste diciendo de que tenía a toda clase acojonada, que tal? 01:09:53:06 - 01:10:22:16 Desconocido Y él me decía bueno, es que los niños dicen muchas cosas, a los niños dicen muchas cosas, tal. Y yo le contesté no, los niños dicen muchas cosas, no, es que yo pienso que directamente te lo estás inventando tú. ¿Y me dijo Los niños podrán decir muchas cosas, pero son niños no? Pero para eso como son autoritarios, no como, como si entre comillas tendrían dar ese toque de atención hacia los niños. 01:10:22:22 - 01:10:51:24 Desconocido Pero ya decir que tu hijo es un peligro porque muy de repente ahí me dijo que él no había dicho eso, que él no, que ni ni que era un peligro, ni que tenía a los niños acojonados. Cuando hacía un minuto que decía que los niños dicen cosas por los niños, a los cinco minutos ya no decían nada, pero a la carta de la carta la remito, No, porque la carta sabe ya la información. 01:10:51:24 - 01:11:33:14 Desconocido O sea, si dentro de la contradicción que está teniendo este director, si la carta también es contradictoria, entonces, o sea que quien dice la verdad, lo que lo que expresa la carta que me imagino que será certificada o lo que expresa el director, o sea, si en la carta ya, ya pone por ciertas razones en las que están degradando a tu hijo, por, por, por, porque tienen miedo, porque entre comillas es un psicópata que tiene a todo el mundo acojonado. 01:11:33:17 - 01:12:04:28 Desconocido Es raro que yo diga acojonado por aquí, pero bueno, pero es que ya es el cabreo que me da el poder escuchar esto, porque claro, tienes la versión que que no grababas durante la primera cita, pero en la segunda cita ya grabasteis y a lo mejor se lo estaba oliendo naturalmente y que luego la carta está diciendo lo mismo que te dijo en la primera la primera vez que estuviste con él, con el director. 01:12:05:01 - 01:12:42:03 Desconocido Sí, digo ya porque yo he tenido el el honor de de ver la carta y de saber directamente lo que lo que pone dentro de dentro de ella. Sí, sí, sí. Y en esa segunda reunión, como enseño en el Departamento de Educación, llamemosle, eh, se puso en contacto con el en la segunda reunión, la opción que me dio el director, supongo que porque se lo diría el inspector fue que mi hijo podía ir si iba yo como persona de apoyo. 01:12:42:06 - 01:13:09:23 Desconocido ¿Cuando mi hijo tiene una tarjeta de discapacidad donde pone que no necesita tarjeta persona de apoyo, pero pero directamente a ver, aunque no necesite tarjeta de apoyo, te refieres a lo del viaje a País Vasco o al país Vasco? ¿Claro, y yo no podía ir porque aparte de mi hijo tengo una niña de ocho años que hago? Dejo a mi hija sola en casa, me la llevo también y que pierda clase. 01:13:09:26 - 01:13:32:06 Desconocido ¿Es que a ver, pero pero es que directamente si necesita de una persona, aunque en la tarjeta dice que es totalmente funcional, que no necesita, que a lo mejor necesita un toque de atención para que se tome algún medicamento, no? Porque se puede olvidar. Puede ser recordar que si se ha tomado la pastilla, que la pastilla para el tema de la hiperactividad y el déficit de atención y para la depresión. 01:13:32:08 - 01:14:23:26 Desconocido Y para eso tienes que ir a País Vasco a acompañarle. Y el docente que es lo que hace, se toca los huevos. Es que claro, como no les pagan por irse de viaje, eso no lo cobran. Pues que pues entonces yo entonces clientes, lo de mi hijo cuando tienen 30 niños más a ver directamente entonces que si no lo van a cobrar ese viaje, pues que no organicen viajes de fin de curso, no, no Y es que encima no es de fin de curso, es que es un viaje de estudios donde de ese viaje de estudios le han puesto deberes, que tiene que hacer un diario de su viaje en el País Vasco. 01:14:23:29 - 01:14:57:18 Desconocido ¿Alguien me puede decir que diario va a hacer mi hijo del País Vasco? Porque como no sea como no sea el diario de Noa, me parece increíble. ¿No va a escribir tu hijo El Diario de Noa en vez del diario del Vasco? Porque. Pero es que necesariamente, o sea, yo me estoy quedando flipando e investigando, flipando con con el tema del viaje por el simple hecho de que un profesor no cobre el viaje es que también estaba en su jornada laboral. 01:14:57:18 - 01:15:51:14 Desconocido No podríamos decir tendría que cobrar sus horas lectivas, no si sus horas que ellos viven muy bien, que ellos cobran incluso estando de vacaciones y que por lo que cobran de nuestros impuestos y obviamente yo no pago los impuestos para que maltraten psicológicamente a mi hijo. Naturalmente, dentro de lo que son esos, esos impuestos que directamente están están cobrando a raíz de nosotros, deberían de tener más empatía y más tacto y más cuidado hacia hacia la persona en este caso hacia tu hijo, y decir que no va a cuidar de 30 de 30 personas, pero es que no está cuidando de 30 personas únicamente es mandar un recordatorio de si se ha tomado una medicación. 01:15:51:17 - 01:16:21:02 Desconocido Yo creo que no cuesta nada preguntarlo. Si te has tomado la medicación para la hiperactividad, ya está en punto, ya disfruta del viaje, disfruta del País Vasco, que es muy bonito y hace mucho frío, pero no lo entiendo. ¿Y que tengas que ir tú que dices? Claro, tú tienes tu vida, tú tienes una hija que has hecho ocho años, creo que ocho años, y tienes una hija de ocho años que tiene también que ir al colegio. 01:16:21:07 - 01:17:07:11 Desconocido No la puedes dejar sola, obviamente, porque un niño de ocho años no es, no es, no es independiente, no es, no sabe cocinar, no sabe hacer gran, gran cosa. Entonces me parece, me parece increíble que la contestación que te den eso y encima más. Si es una cosa que que directamente tiene que ver con con el estudio en el cual tiene que hacer un diario o tiene que hacer un trabajo sobre ello, pues me parece como una falta de empatía, una cosa vergonzosa, directamente, porque lo que dices tú que se va a inventar no va a escribir. 01:17:07:14 - 01:17:42:18 Desconocido Como te digo, el diario de Noa y también hacen un concurso donde puede participar si quieren, que le dan al ganador un cheque de ábaco a la mejor fotografía hecha en el País Vasco. Pues nada, pues yo siento que estando ahí, en lo alto de mí, como de tiempo sea, es que claramente se está viendo que se están riendo. 01:17:42:18 - 01:18:17:24 Desconocido O sea, no es que se están riendo de ti, de tu hijo, se están riendo de todos en general, o sea, dan un concurso. Pues nada que que la inteligencia artificial no directamente y. En vez de sacar una foto al País Vasco, saca una foto a lo que sea, a algo que es que no va del no conozco Barcelona solo entonces pues que saque una foto de ahí y que diga al GPS conviértelo en el País Vasco y ya está. 01:18:17:25 - 01:18:53:00 Desconocido A la directamente ella. Pues un premio que en realidad me da es lo digo irónicamente porque es que me parece la gilipollez más absurda que puede haber en este mundo. Veo que todo está tan injusto en este centro, en el Zárraga, Ferrán Casanova. No voy a hablar de Casablanca, vale, perdón, Casablanca, Ferrán, Casablanca, que no me canso. Es que me dan ganas hasta de llamarlos ahora mismo a preguntarles, a ver que. 01:18:53:03 - 01:19:49:23 Desconocido Que qué me cuentan. Me dan ganas de ir hasta por saber directamente, pero esa trucada no a quien lo llame. ¿Espero cualquier cosa porque? Porque me parece todo tan tan injusto, tan irrisorio, tan subrealista y menos real. Hombre, es que es que es surrealista, porque es que volvemos al principio estamos entrando casi como. Como en un bucle. No es un centro que es inclusivo y dentro de esa inclusión no se, no hay inclusión realmente hacia hacia una persona de ningún tipo, no hay ningún tipo ni de género ni de neuro divergencia, ni de absolutamente nada. 01:19:49:25 - 01:20:25:22 Desconocido O sea, no, no se donde está ahí la inclusividad, inclusividad, inclusividad que he visto es la de la estupidez, ahí otra no he visto, claro. Y luego ya pues el trato que recibes tanto tú como tu hijo, los problemas psicológicos, es que yo directamente ese centro lo. Vuelvo a repetir nuevamente dentro de este bucle en el que estamos entrando nuevamente, es poner una denuncia al centro. 01:20:25:24 - 01:20:50:18 Desconocido Es que yo iría hasta la Generalitat, sí, si hiciera falta o no, si ya lo he hecho también ha también ha sido la Generalitat. Sí, sí, no paro y el tiempo con mi depresión a full. Pero no paró de mover el tema de mi hijo. ¿Y en la Generalitat te han dicho alguna cosa o de alguna manera había dado respuesta? 01:20:50:21 - 01:21:16:16 Desconocido Porque ya sabemos que que esto va más lento que el caballo al malo. ¿El tema de la justicia, el tema de quién? Pero, pero me imagino. Bueno, si ya se va a lo que es la Generalitat, me imagino que y también me he puesto en contacto con la alcaldesa de Sabadell, puesto que en el Ayuntamiento de Sabadell, en pocas palabras, me dijeron que le sabía muy mal lo que me pasaba, pero que es el abusaba. 01:21:16:16 - 01:21:48:13 Desconocido Vamos, que eso era cosa de ensenyament. Digo vale ya, pero bueno, es un centro público respecto a Sabadell dentro de que cabe igual que hacen visitas por ejemplo al ayuntamiento para ver cómo se gobierna. Yo creo que la alcaldesa debería de darse también una visita por el centro para, ver cómo tratan a los alumnos. Por eso ya me he puesto en contacto, ya no con el Ayuntamiento. 01:21:48:13 - 01:22:28:04 Desconocido Aparte el la Comisión de Educación, dime la Consellería de Educación o si Ensenyament viene a hacer a ese señor en la mayoría sí, vale, pero también habrá algún algún regidor, no un un regidor especializado en educación fuera de Ensenyament. Es que tampoco. Tampoco te sé decir porque es la primera vez que me veo en esta eh. En esto envuelta. 01:22:28:06 - 01:23:10:08 Desconocido FA Voy, voy buscando todos sitios, voy preguntando, voy recopilando información como puedo y haciendo todo todo lo que veo al alcance de mi mano. Ya, pero a ver, ahí demuestra si lo que es la la valenciano, porque has ido a diferentes organizaciones para para dar voz y dar visibilidad a lo que es el caso que que es preocupante y es alarmista directamente o porque se ha creado lo que es una alarma a raíz de, lo que es tu hijo. 01:23:10:08 - 01:23:57:04 Desconocido ¿Pero fíjate cómo son las cosas, ha sido algún medio de comunicación? No es lo que me lo que quedó. ¿No se te ha ocurrido? Pues yo creo que deberías de acudir a un medio de comunicación, aunque te voy a decir también que los medios de comunicación están muy politizados ya. Entonces, dentro de lo que hay, de lo que es el medio de comunicación, puede salirte bien la jugada o puede salir mal dependiendo Les gusta mucho el morbo, eso sí, pero se rigen también por por mucha política es y ya dentro de lo que es un medio, pero yo creo que un medio sobre todo catalán en este caso, o dar visibilidad a nivel nacional como 01:23:57:05 - 01:24:54:12 Desconocido como en este caso, a través de este podcast se va a dar visibilidad con todos los los oyentes y que tiene, pero yo creo que es imprescindible que esto salga a la luz y que el Ferran casa no va a cerrar sus puertas. Sí, totalmente que y que le hagan una inspección y. Y que vean si realmente están cualificados para estar o donde están, porque por tener simplemente la carrera no creo que estén cualificados para tratar con que al final son niños y la mente de un niño es muy frágil como en la mente del niño. 01:24:54:15 - 01:25:20:18 Desconocido ¿Pero es que luego también en la mente del padre, porque el padre es el que el que está sufriendo todo el problema y todo el tránsito no? En este caso basta. Mira ya al final me dejo en un segundo plano. Yo siempre digo que que a mí que me hagan lo que quieran, que que me da igual. Pero mis hijos son intocables, tanto tú como como la pequeño no sea. 01:25:20:19 - 01:26:01:24 Desconocido ¿No? Ya, pero bueno, una son intocables porque eres la madre, la protectora, que es lo que lo que te he dicho directamente de que de que cuando tú tienes un hijo creas ese vínculo. No, tú eres quien lleva la carga durante los nueve meses del hijo. Entonces tus hijos te duelen y tu morirías por tus hijos. Podríamos decir no como cualquier madre, claro, pero, pero es que no solamente el problema está en tu hijo, no, el problema también está en ti, también te afecta a ti directamente. 01:26:01:24 - 01:26:43:28 Desconocido ¿Entonces yo creo que tanto tu hijo como tú necesitáis esa ayuda que es primordial para para poder arreglar un poco no? Y sonreír directamente dentro de lo que de lo que es para, para que otro, por ejemplo, siga con la ilusión que tenía de seguir con una carrera artística, que además la carrera artística es preciosa. Sí, lo general le animaría directamente a que a que siguiera es ese camino, pero tiene que tiene que aprender también a que lo van a etiquetar y lo van a juzgar siempre. 01:26:44:01 - 01:27:41:23 Desconocido Si yo yo le digo que ahora lo lo está pasando mal, bueno, lo estamos pasando mal y que nos queda, aunque esto simplemente es una batalla más de las muchas que nos quedan, pero que a la larga todo esto no nos va a hacer más fuerte, sobre todo a él. ¿Efectivamente, la valentía está en la fortaleza, entonces pues, pues ella se nos va el tiempo del programa ha sido un verdadero y un verdadero placer estar con contigo y que cuentas pues hayas contado ese ese testimonio y haremos todo lo posible por darle la máxima visibilidad a lo que está ocurriendo con con otro y espero que dentro de poco tengamos unas buenas noticias, no? 01:27:41:23 - 01:28:13:09 Desconocido Y que pues si no cierran el Ferran Casanova, pues Casablanca, Casablanca no, Casablanca. Me quedo con lo de Casanova, que a ver si va a haber un casanova pobre y le va a caer todo. Pues el Casablanca, el Ferran Casablanca sí. Si se cierra o le hacen una inspección directamente, esperemos que no, pues sea se ha valido el testimonio que que has dicho Jueces a la cárcel. 01:28:13:09 - 01:30:01:02 Desconocido Muchas gracias. Y desde aquí pues muchísima fuerza también. Muchas gracias. Un besito para ti y un besito también para para Otto. Pues hasta aquí llegamos, señoras y señores. Es un tema muy muy candente, muy muy horrible. Y bueno, pues esperemos que la cosa vaya solucionando. Nos vemos la semana que viene aquí en el punto de vista.

En esta edición, exploramos los desafíos de inclusión en el Instituto Ferran Casablancas en Sabadell. Nos encontramos ante un caso que destaca la necesidad de acción y consciencia sobre la inclusión de estudiantes con autismo en el sistema educativo. Una valiente madre comparte con nosotros su experiencia frente a la dura realidad de ver a su hijo rechazado por una institución educativa tras la educación secundaria obligatoria. Este lamentable rechazo ha tenido implicaciones en la salud mental del menor, un área a menudo descuidada en el proceso educativo. A pesar de los avances significativos en la conciencia sobre la diversidad y la inclusión, aún existen obstáculos importantes como actitudes discriminatorias y la insuficiencia de recursos educativos adaptados. Abordamos la importancia de no solo brindar acceso físico a la educación sino, más crucialmente, de generar un entorno que respete, comprenda y se adapte a las necesidades individuales de cada estudiante. Situaciones como la vivida en el Instituto Ferran Casablancas provocan preguntas profundas sobre el compromiso real de nuestras instituciones con la inclusión genuina. Es un llamado a reevaluar cómo podemos hacer que la educación sea verdaderamente accesible y enriquecedora para todos. Hoy en \\"Punto de Vista\\" proponemos una reflexión conjunta y buscamos soluciones para que historias como la de esta familia sean la excepción y no la regla.

Hoy tenemos un tema bastante delicado porque son los desafíos de la inclusión en el Instituto Ferran Casablancas en Sabadell y las barreras hacia la aceptación, en este caso de un estado de un estudiante con autismo se encuentra en el ojo de la tormenta debido a un caso que destaca la necesidad urgente de abordar las barreras para la inclusión de estudiantes con con autismo. 00:00:53:00 - 00:01:26:16 Desconocido Una madre coraje que vamos a conocer enseguida se ha visto obligada a lidiar con la dolorosa realidad de que su hijo, diagnosticado con autismo, haya sido rechazado por la institución educativa una vez finalizada la Educación Secundaria obligatoria, generando consecuencias adversas para la salud mental del menor del menor. El caso en cuestión revela una problemática más amplia relacionada con la inclusión de estudiantes con con especialidades en el sistema educativo. 00:01:26:16 - 00:01:58:14 Desconocido A pesar de los avances en conciencia sobre la diversidad y la inclusión, persisten desafíos significativos como la discriminación y la falta de recursos adaptados. Esta madre, esta madre coraje, pues denuncia que su hijo al enfrentar el rechazo en el Instituto Ferran Casablancas, que lo vamos a mencionar muchísimo para no darle publicidad buena y positiva, sino para darle la publicidad que se merece. 00:01:58:16 - 00:02:28:17 Desconocido Pues como decíamos, hay consecuencias para para la salud de este menor directamente. La inclusión no se trata solo de admitir físicamente a estudiantes en las aulas, sino crear un ambiente que fomente respeto, la comprensión y la adaptación a las necesidades individuales, cosa que en este caso no se está cumpliendo. Tenemos hoy en el punto de vista a Sheila. 00:02:28:19 - 00:03:08:06 Desconocido Bienvenida, Sheila. Hola, Muchas gracias. Más o menos. Es prácticamente lo que. Lo que he contado, lo que. Lo que está ocurriendo con con tu hijo dentro de lo que es este. Este instituto. ¿Recibisteis una notificación, una carta? No, en la cual si la tengo, la tengo aquí. Y la carta lo que dice es que debido A1A problemas que tu hijo ha causado, como. 00:03:08:06 - 00:03:42:20 Desconocido ¿Como cortes, insultos y demás, cosa que es totalmente falso según se ha visto en una red social, en este caso tic toc, en la cual es totalmente falso la que sale tu hijo directamente, explicando también que es lo que podía haber ocurrido, que es lo que había ocurrido, no? ¿Entonces cuéntame cuál es, cuál es el paso que se está llevando a cabo con con este instituto? 00:03:42:22 - 00:04:16:08 Desconocido ¿ER Pues ahora mismo mi hijo no está yendo porque está muy mal, obviamente, porque nuevamente se siente discriminado, eh? Nuevamente que se sienta un bicho raro y ahora no, y luego psicológicamente lo han destruido tanto que se ve incapaz de hacer un bachillerato. ¿Eh? ¿Todo esto está en manos de Ensenyament, eh? He hablado varias veces con el inspector. 00:04:16:11 - 00:04:51:24 Desconocido Eh, que le toca ese centro. El jueves tengo reunión con el inspector y con la jefa de la inspección. ¿Eh? También he puesto una denuncia por los Mossos d'Esquadra. Er. Hay un examen de Sabadell. También me he puesto en contacto también con la alcaldesa de Sabadell con Lazo. Bueno, vale, parece que hemos perdido la señal. Ya la tenemos recuperada nuevamente. 00:04:51:27 - 00:05:27:01 Desconocido Es la pregunta. Vale. Vale. El ESO. Er. ¿Porque también han habido casos de transfobia tanto por parte del profesorado como por parte del alumnado, no? Claro que hay que decir una cosa que no, que no he dicho porque no sabía si podía decirlo. ¿No? ¿Sí, sí, es que tu, tu hijo ha realizado el proceso de transformación, no? Para, para, para ser chico. 00:05:27:03 - 00:06:04:03 Desconocido Y dentro de eso también ha tenido esa discriminación. ¿Sí, y es un centro inclusivo supuestamente, no? Sí, supuestamente dentro de A estabas comentando que en este momento él no está yendo a a clase por por el tema de de que se está ocasionando en en el instituto. ¿No es este revuelo, no? A Me llamó mucho la atención, por ejemplo, el tema de que decía que se auto iniciaba. 00:06:04:06 - 00:06:38:09 Desconocido Claro, no, eso no es eso, eso se llama el AVE, es que tiene un nombre como comentabas. ¿Bueno, en cuestiones técnicas pues tampoco vamos a saberlo, no? ¿Pero que se rascaba mucho no? Y que al rascarse se rasca compulsivamente y es una manera que tienen los autistas. No digo el tema de rascar eh, es una de las cosas que hacen para regularse. 00:06:38:12 - 00:07:13:05 Desconocido Estereotipia se llama estereotipia. Sí, sí, también yo que sé. Se muerde la ropa hasta tal punto de romperla o se pone a dar vueltas, hace los típicos. El típico balanceo que es más conocido de los autistas se mover compulsivamente la pierna, andar de un lado para otro y en algo también le dan como tics de levantar la mano. 00:07:13:05 - 00:07:47:11 Desconocido Empieza ciego a con el cuello. ¿Bueno, son síntomas que tiene de autismo no? ¿O sea, si yo por ejemplo como de exteriorizar los nervios hacia afuera, el el único que me parece que haya estereotipia eh? ¿Dañinos que podrían ser está de rascarse compulsivamente? Pues porque claro, al final se acaba haciendo daño, pero el resto no le repercute negativamente a él, simplemente es una manera como de relacionarse. 00:07:47:13 - 00:08:19:12 Desconocido De hecho, yo conozco muchos casos de autismo porque nosotros hemos hablado antes en previamente, antes del programa, y yo te comenté un caso muy cercano mío. Hay distintos grados de autismo, aunque siempre existe ese ese factor de los movimientos de rascar y demás. Pero por lo menos yo lo que he visto de tu hijo, naturalmente no lo podemos mostrar en pantalla porque es un menor. 00:08:19:15 - 00:09:03:16 Desconocido Pero lo que he visto de tu hijo tiene una conversación coherente. No, no es como el caso que yo conozco, que se expresa sin sin hablar a través de signos, con lo cual, dentro de la inclusividad en el centro, ha podido aprender de una manera normal, aunque cueste un poquito más el aprendizaje debido al al autismo, que tenga un poco de déficit de atención, pero lo que a mí no me no me gusta es el comportamiento que este centro está teniendo con con con tu hijo, porque le está afectando. 00:09:03:18 - 00:09:37:26 Desconocido Si ya tiene un, un, una, una cosa que es ser una persona especial y de hecho las personas autistas son muchísimo más sensibles, no que una persona que no tiene autismo como como tú o como yo afecta psicológicamente muchísimo más. Entonces lo estará pasando en este momento, pues de alguna forma no sé si habrá recibido también bullying por parte de sus compañeros por el tema de la memoria los últimos días que fue al al colegio. 00:09:37:28 - 00:10:06:06 Desconocido Bullying como tal no, pero lo que hacían era hacerle el vacío como si no existiera. Pero tanto alumnado como profesorado lo ignoraban totalmente. Pero dentro de dentro de lo que es. A ver, entiendo que dentro del alumnado no, porque ya sabemos que los niños son muy muy crueles, tienden a ser demasiado crueles. ¿Pero a nivel de profesorado me parece un poco vergonzoso, no? 00:10:06:07 - 00:10:42:17 Desconocido Que tengan a unos docentes contratados y que no hagan acopio a a los problemas que pueda tener el el menor. ¿En este caso el en este momento está en algún tipo de tratamiento psicológico psiquiátrico a causa de ello? Bueno, el tiene su seguimiento en Taly. Yo estoy esperando a ver si consigo dar con su psiquiatra, porque dar con otro nuevo es para nada, es perder una hora entera porque tienes que volver a explicar todo el rato lo mismo. 00:10:42:19 - 00:11:26:27 Desconocido Sí, claro, naturalmente. Pero si están muy saturados. Quieta, Oliva, fatal Tali, que es porque en este es el Hospital de la Oscuridad de la Seguridad Social, donde lleva psiquiatría y psicología como un cap de si muere un cabrón en un hospital. Más que capos está el CAP, el centro de salud y el hospital que te bajas divergencias. Una es un hospital especializado dentro de lo que es el hospital, dentro de lo que es la rama de psiquiatría y psicología. 00:11:27:00 - 00:11:56:26 Desconocido No podríamos hacer. ¿Actor Sí, y está teniendo el seguimiento, el seguimiento por por el tema de la depresión, por el tema de de me imagino no? Pero por el tema de la depresión, porque el seguimiento, por por el tema del autismo también lo tendrá. Pero es una cosa diferente. Sí, lo tiene en el sentido de enseñarle a canalizar ese nervio y no hacer estas. 00:11:56:26 - 00:12:32:23 Desconocido Estereotipia es dañino. Es lo que está en internet, porque obviamente el autismo naces con él. ¿No? No es ninguna enfermedad que se pueda curar ni nada, por lo cual no es que le vayan a dar un tratamiento. Sí, técnicas de relajación es diferente. Vale, lo que hace es ir a grupos de como un grupo de terapia, podríamos decir, para enseñarle directamente a no autolesionarse debido a esos, esos movimientos es hiperactividad. 00:12:32:23 - 00:13:04:13 Desconocido No podríamos decir, pero yo quiero ir un poco más allá dentro de lo que es lo normal, que es lo que me estás contando. No es enseñanza para para que tenga una una vida mejor en cuestión de de no dañarse, no hacerse daño a raíz de lo que ha pasado en este colegio que le dicen o que le han dicho es que todavía no hemos conseguido contactar. 00:13:04:13 - 00:13:29:02 Desconocido ¿Quieres decir con su psiquiatra? Sí, con con un especialista que hayáis podido hablar sobre sobre el tema de la rabia no hemos podido hablar. Es que va muy mal y es el que nos toca. Y no, no podemos ir a otro, por así decirlo. Ya, pero es una situación de urgencia. Yo lo veo. ¿No? Sí, sí, pero que les da igual. 00:13:29:02 - 00:14:18:09 Desconocido Vaya, es que Talía va fatal, tiene muy buenos profesionales, pero el funcionamiento es pésimo. Bueno, pues como casi toda la sanidad, entonces no son profesionales y hay mucha lista de espera. Aunque tengas una urgencia. ¿Decías que habías denunciado también ante los Mossos d'Esquadra, no? Y los Mossos que que han dicho que acabarán Ensenyament igual que en todos sitios, porque al final enseña a menores como el el el que se encarga de esto se hace cualquier cosa que tú hagas, ya sea vía judicial, vía mossos, todo va a Ensenyament, vale, pero Ensenyament es una institución pública. 00:14:18:09 - 00:15:14:15 Desconocido ¿O si tú estás en Sabadell, que no existe Ensenyament, entonces hace ya pues el departamento de de colegios no? No lo sé, como se llamara, fuera de aquí, como si fuera educación. Aquí sí, en Madrid, por ejemplo, como si fuera un adaptación a la educación o alguna cosa, si eso. Y ahí se establece lo que es una queja referente a este, hasta este centro, que espero que se me había ido el nombre Ferran Casablancas hasta el centro, pero en Ensenyament, que es lo que hacen únicamente porque es la primera vez que fui, que fue cuando me avisaron. 00:15:14:18 - 00:16:18:25 Desconocido Me avisaron los jueves siendo el viaje el martes siguiente estando confirmado desde diciembre estamos hablando todo esto de ahora, esto de enero del mes de enero. ER Pues me avisan el jueves de que otro lo puede ir por bueno, según pone ahí constantes autolesiones, falta la autoridad y no sé que más. ER Bueno, sí, es una serie de cosas, sí, y que lo habían hecho siguiendo las indicaciones del capi, que es como el equipo psicológico del centro, que me hace especial gracia esto porque es un equipo psicológico que como que dice que mi hijo está muy mal en equipo psicológico, que mi hijo no ha visto en su vida entonces dentro, que no lo han 00:16:18:25 - 00:16:55:17 Desconocido visto psicológicamente para saber si está bien o mal. Pero yo ya te puedo decir directamente que que yo lo veo muy normal a tu hijo. Yo he tenido el gusto de poder verle y ver cómo se expresa, no referente a esa denuncia, a esa carta a la que a la que estás diciendo de que se auto lesionaba dentro de ese vídeo que está publicado en el TIC TOC, por ejemplo, se explica perfectamente y se ve a las personas que no sepan catalán, naturalmente no van a entender ni J. 00:16:55:17 - 00:17:21:15 Desconocido Pero lo explicáis tanto o vosotros no lo explicamos todo en castellano. El vídeo sí, no, pero. Pero el texto que había detrás estaban catalanes, pero lo leemos en castellano, Claro, es a lo que me refería, que lo que aunque el texto estuviera en catalán, lo estáis hablando en en castellano, lo estáis diciendo de esa forma. ¿Para, para que? 00:17:21:15 - 00:17:53:13 Desconocido Para dar ese ese tipo de visibilidad y estáis tanto tú como como tu hijo, en este caso explicando los problemas de tu hijo, diciendo esto es que no ha sido así, esto no pasó así, esto es una cosa que entonces es también un poco incomprensible la carta, yo me refiero a la carta o sea, no las explicaciones que hacéis vosotros, porque yo perfectamente entiendo catalán, porque yo he trabajado en Cataluña y se hablarlo perfectamente también. 00:17:53:15 - 00:18:42:10 Desconocido ¿Entonces yo la carta que la he visto, pues a mí me parece una locura, no? Lo que lo que pone dentro de ella, pero hacía referencia y hacía copio a las personas que no entiende catalán, catalán sí. Entonces dentro de lo que pone que ponía que se auto lesionaba y ponía algo de enero que no recuerdo ahora mismo tendría que ver el vídeo nuevamente sobre una fecha de enero que me imagino que sería estaría, que sería cuando, cuando, cuando iban a dejar ya de de que dejase de estudiar lo que le hace estudiar, no tener constancia. 00:18:42:12 - 00:19:32:21 Desconocido Me pareció ver alguna. ¿Sí, porque se acogieron a yo les llevé a un informe de psiquiatría de su psiquiatra donde ponía que él no era ni un peligro, porque el director lo que me dijo a mí como si fuera un psicópata que tenía toda la clase acojonada, eh? Bueno, barbaridades. Y en ese informe como cómo puede decir un director que tiene acojonada a la clase Si, porque en el viaje del País Vasco, que era él, el escolar que no ha ido, tenían que dormir de cinco en cinco, pues que estaban todos con miedo de que les tocara dormir con otro por si se hacía el daño o les hacía daño a alguien. 00:19:32:23 - 00:20:06:04 Desconocido Pero a ver si una de enero se agarra una cosa que pone en el informe que le presento yo de psiquiatría, donde pone que no existe ningún peligro, que pone, que se especifica en el informe que el alumno necesita soporte flexible de adulto para la organización de sus tareas instrumentales y asegurarse la toma correcta del tratamiento que esto viene a hacer, a decirle otro. 00:20:06:04 - 00:20:36:12 Desconocido ¿Te has acordado de tomarte las pastillas? Ya está ya. Un seguimiento que puede hacer un supervisor en este caso sería un un profesor, podríamos decir lo que lo que yo no entiendo es que dentro de un informe psiquiátrico diga que no hay peligro, porque es que realmente también una persona que sea autista no es agresivo. Hay casos en los que hay agresividad, pero en los casos que son demasiado graves. 00:20:36:14 - 00:21:22:20 Desconocido Pero es que directamente el la agresividad que tienen es autolesionarse ellos mismos. Bueno, hay de todo, porque yo sí que trabajo, claro que sí, hay de todo grado, pero otro es grado uno. Y aparte de todo esto, no tiene ninguna incapacidad intelectual. ¿De hecho es alta capacidades, eh? ¿Y cuando le dieron la discapacidad le otorgaron la tarjeta, digamos, le dieron un 37% basándose en sus notas y eran todas de excelente, pues porque tiene altas capacidades, sí, pero vale, es un grado uno que es un grado minoritario, no? 00:21:22:21 - 00:21:55:07 Desconocido ¿O sea, es un grado menor, eh? Yo por ejemplo, quien conozco tiene un grado más alto, pero tampoco ha sido agredido. Lo único bueno, lo máximo que ha hecho son morderme a mí, pero no es una cosa así, que vaya a hacerlo también. Dependiendo Luego ya va a un centro especializado, está este chico, a un centro especializado, el tuyo va a un centro de inclusión y justamente estás diciendo las notas que son excelentes. 00:21:55:09 - 00:22:24:25 Desconocido Lo único que tiene el déficit de atención en el que tiene que tener un recordatorio de lo que se tenga que tomar, pero ya de ahí que ya lo etiqueten, no como como una persona agresiva, que que todo el mundo le tenga miedo porque pueda hacer daño a alguien o hacerse daño. El mismo podríamos decir, me parece una excusa un poco idiota. 00:22:24:27 - 00:23:04:07 Desconocido Sí, totalmente. ¿Y más yendo de la mano con un informe de de al día siguiente, que era cuando le tocó la última, la última palabra del discurso que tuvo su Y de hecho, para más muestra el año pasado en el otro instituto que no pudo seguir porque no había artístico ahí, ya que artísticos hay pocos, eh? ¿Es el Arrahona que también lo quiero mencionar porque trataron a mi hijo fenomenal, o sea, una pasada eh? 00:23:04:14 - 00:23:36:13 Desconocido Se fue a Roma por sus compañeros, como cualquier chico normal y no pasó absolutamente nada. Bueno, no tiene porque pasar nada. Y además descubrió Roma, que es precioso totalmente, que es una maravilla. ¿Pues mira, pues ahí por ejemplo, este instituto dentro de lo que cabe también es de Sabadell o es algo ahí sí, y porque por qué lo sacaste de allí si estaba bien? 00:23:36:16 - 00:24:22:23 Desconocido ¿Porque lo hace en el bachillerato que quería hacer mi hijo de artístico, vale? ¿O sea, entonces se tuvo que cambiar a este otro instituto por por este tema, pero yo creo que más vale lo bueno conocido que lo malo por conocer, no? Entonces bueno, si el chico, por ejemplo, que quiere estudiar algo artístico y no, no lo aceptan, pero es que también debería de tener un poco más de de empatía, podríamos decir en el Ferran Casa Casablancas, porque me parece patético todo lo que están haciendo con tu hijo y a ti también te está afectando bastante. 00:24:22:25 - 00:24:54:24 Desconocido Hombre, a mí me está afectando muchísimo. Ahora mismo estoy de baja, tengo una tienda, la tengo cerrada ya que soy la la única persona de la clase de 9 de enero. Exactamente. Yo estoy con depresión mayor, con trastorno de ansiedad y. Y es que no puedo me a o sea, ir a buscar a mi pequeña al colegio. Me supone un esfuerzo increíble. 00:24:54:26 - 00:25:29:02 Desconocido Sea el tema también de salir a la calle, por ejemplo, y más teniendo un trastorno ansioso o depresivo mayor en el en el cual quedas anulada directamente. No sé si estás tú también en tratamiento psiquiátrico y es psicológico y todo a raíz de un sistema educativo que no se está haciendo cargo de de lo que ocurre en el Ferran Casablancas. 00:25:29:04 - 00:25:55:19 Desconocido Esa. Y es que hay un problema muy grande con bueno, de hecho se ha puesto en contacto otra mamá del mismo centro que su hijo, también es autista, un grado como el de mi hijo, que también quería denunciarlo. Le he dicho que viniera para hacer la entrevista, pero tenía médico y tal. No ha podido. Pero para Ensenyament si queremos las dos juntas. 00:25:55:22 - 00:26:24:15 Desconocido Y hay otra mamá más que también. Pero por el tema de de no respetar el pronombre de su hijo trans tampoco es otra madre dentro del mismo centro que tiene el mismo problema que tú, más otra madre que tiene a un hijo hija que sea transexual, un bueno es un padre. Mentira que la madre decía si es que siempre me lío. 00:26:24:18 - 00:26:59:12 Desconocido Es el padre, sí. O sea que no es el único caso, el de tu hijo. Hay varios y me han hablado más casos por privado, que es que yo he alucinado de lo mal que les han tratado psicológicamente, pero ya no hablando de personas neuro divergente, sino de personas neurotípicos. O sea, como nosotros, que le han destrozado la salud mental y lo que han hecho ha sido dejar los estudios por cambiar de centro o dejarlo y hasta y y hasta. 00:26:59:12 - 00:27:30:12 Desconocido Y yo he dicho pues yo no me voy a callar, no me da la gana, porque hay un problema muy grave que estos niños de TEA uno son como muy especiales para un centro normal, pero muy normales para un centro especial. No hay un centro realmente, para ellos no lo existe, no existe. A ver o existir no existen naturalmente. 00:27:30:14 - 00:28:04:11 Desconocido Cuando una persona es neuro divergente, en este caso tiene que ir a un centro específico y especial basado en empresas, en personas con las mismas capacidades cognitivas. ¿Pero entonces para que existen los los institutos o los colegios de inclusión? ¿Porque se supone que esas actividades o ese mecanismo es totalmente adaptable? ¿No a las necesidades, en este caso de tu hijo, de las otras personas? 00:28:04:14 - 00:28:33:23 Desconocido Sí, sí. De hecho, cuando lo apunté hice una primera reunión antes de que empezara el colegio con su tutor. Le llevé todo los informes de mi hijo e le llevé su día, sus diagnósticos. Le expliqué el tema de su transición para que en las listas pusieran el nombre de otro puesto que todavía no tenía el DNI cambiado, que ya sí lo tienen. 00:28:33:26 - 00:29:14:06 Desconocido Y la respuesta fue que no había ningún problema, que tenían un equipo especializado en TEA. ¿Y yo, claro, me quedé tranquila de decir pues fenomenal, no? Pero ya ves que dentro de lo que hay no hay TDAH por ningún lado, no hay ningún equipo especializado y encima el director un poco incompetente. Sí, ya, ya he tenido dos dos reuniones con él y he los no, no, no sé ni que decir la verdad. 00:29:14:09 - 00:30:05:22 Desconocido Puedes decir lo que quieras porque aquí no hay ningún tipo de censura. ¿Lamentable lo que lo que ocurre directamente en en este caso, ya que hay varias familias que están con un problema parecido al alto, yo directamente una denuncia colectiva, un no sería funcional si es que hoy se ha puesto en contacto conmigo eh? Pues al poquito de de hablarnos se ha puesto en contacto la la mamá del del nene autista y a través de TIC toc se puso en contacto conmigo el nene trans de que no le respetaban sus pronombres. 00:30:05:22 - 00:30:38:09 Desconocido Claro, yo no sabía si él tenía el apoyo de de sus padres si no y el crío me dijo que sí. Digo pues dile a tu padre que vaya al cole, que lo hable, no, si es que eso ya lo ha hecho y pasan de todo. Entonces me quiero poner en contacto con el papá del nene. Pero realmente, o sea, en este caso, este trance del que me estás hablando, solamente tienes que esta diferencia no es autista. 00:30:38:12 - 00:31:31:15 Desconocido Sí lo es, porque es trans y lo trata mejor. ¿Es que una persona trans lo pasan muy mal, no? Yo no te sé decir cuanto, pues porque no lo vivo, pero yo veo llorar a mi hijo constantemente por ese tema y lo veo sufrir y lo veo la disforia que tiene con su cuerpo no lo creo que sea de buen gusto en absoluto, es un cuerpo que no le pertenece directamente, entonces tiene ese problema y para eso bueno pues hay psicólogos especialistas a los cuales cuando, cuando están en proceso de transformación se les va adaptando y enseñando a que su cuerpo va a cambiar, pero que tiene que tener un poquito de paciencia para que 00:31:31:17 - 00:32:20:11 Desconocido ¿que las cosas funcionen, no? Que para eso existen lo que son las hormonas y la hormona y demás, pero ya que haya transfobia dentro de un colegio, por ejemplo, no solamente por el caso de tu hijo, sino por otro caso que es otro otro nene, ya claramente vemos ahí un transfobia en un hospital, pero si yo te iba a preguntar si es un colegio católico y no, no, porque yo soy totalmente atea, jamás lo apuntaría a un colegio católico, es más o menos porque me parecía, o sea, me parece más que un colegio, o sea normal, de un colegio católico. 00:32:20:13 - 00:33:06:24 Desconocido Puede ser también incluso que dentro de lo que es la dirección del centro o el profesorado o los docentes, con el trato que están recibiendo, que están dando perdón hacia tu hijo en este caso y hacia los demás. El el centro no solamente se centre, que a lo mejor por el tema de la inclusividad por el TEA no, pero creo que a lo mejor puede llegar a eso una simple reflexión mía que puede llegar un poquito más allá, no sólo por el TEA, sino ya por un PO, por el tema de del cambio de sexo. 00:33:06:27 - 00:33:58:28 Desconocido Si eso, eso, eso pienso. ¿No sé, es que yo no lo no lo veo lógica, no? Porque sí. Me imagino que antes de entrar al centro, como bien decías, se hace un examen, se hace una valoración, no para para ver que capacidades puede tener en no sé si no me acuerdo si se lo has mencionado, que antes del cambio ya estaba, entras en otra sección, o sea, están tras función en el sentido simplemente del DNI, porque para poder hormonal se necesita autorización de ambos progenitores y su padre, del cual estoy separada, está totalmente en contra. 00:33:59:01 - 00:34:29:20 Desconocido Entonces la transición que está haciendo, pues es la que puede llevar Binder, que es una especie de todo para aplanar el pecho y y poco más, porque es que mucho más no puede hacer. Le hemos hecho el cambio del DNI y ya está. Apoyarlo, acompañarlo, animarlo y poco más. ¿Transición puede hacer hasta los 18? Sí, pero me refería a lo del padre. 00:34:29:20 - 00:35:00:10 Desconocido Me parece una vergüenza también, porque yo creo que un padre tiene que aceptar a un hija, hija e hija. No vamos a usar los tres pronombres porque cada cada persona se define de una manera diferente. Entonces, dentro de esos tres tu hijo decidió ser chico y ha sido rechazado por su padre. Es una cosa que lo veo una falta de ética y una falta de moral por su parte. 00:35:00:12 - 00:35:27:21 Desconocido Pero la pregunta que yo te hacía referente a lo del centro es si el centro ya sabía que no en la transición directamente de hormonas no, porque como bien dices tiene que ser, al ser un menor de edad tiene que haber una forma de los de los dos progenitores, cosa que no ha habido. Otra cosa es el DNI que a partir de los 16 años ya se puede hacer sin ningún tipo de firma. 00:35:27:23 - 00:36:18:07 Desconocido Entonces el centro yo sabía que había una transición, no sé que que otro es otro. Sí, sí, obviamente sí, porque una de las cosas también por las que quise hacer la primera reunión, porque ya para bachiller llerato no se hacen reuniones así, porque ya representa que son mayores y tal. Y yo le dije que bueno, pues que mi hijo tenía una as especialidades si lo quieren llamar así y que yo necesitaba hacer esa reunión con urgencia y al final pues se hizo la reunión y le expliqué el tema de su disforia, el tema del nombre, el tema de otro y otro sí que le llaman, pero por ejemplo me me comentó mi hijo que el 00:36:18:07 - 00:36:49:01 Desconocido ¿primer día de una clase nada más empezar, pues la típica pregunta de por qué has escogido el bachillerato artístico? Y le dijo porque quiero ser ilustrador. Y la profesora le increpaba diciendo ilustrador. Y él le increpaba ilustrador. Y así varias veces, hasta que la profesora le dijo Bueno, lo que seas ya está. Así de mala manera. ¿En serio? 00:36:49:04 - 00:37:15:04 Desconocido Sí. No se ha tomado ningún tipo de medida contra esa profesora. Es que el problema que todo esto yo no lo sabía. Mi hijo que dicen que los autistas no tienen empatía. Totalmente mentira al ver que yo estoy con depresión, que mi depresión viene de antes, pero que esto la ha agravado mucho más. Obviamente he no me contaba nada. 00:37:15:04 - 00:37:57:26 Desconocido ¿Cómo te ha ido Olinsky? Bien. O tengo, estoy o como mucho estoy muy agobiado porque me veo que no llego con tantos deberes y cosas así. Y luego también como que normalizó mucho el tema de transfobia. Lo acabó. Yo creo que eran tantos los casos que lo acabó asumiendo, asimilando, normalizando y cuando e hice como un comunicado para avisar al centro de que iba a tomar unas medidas, le pregunté a mi hijo dime todo lo que si te han pasado alguna, alguna cosa más que no me hayan dicho. 00:37:57:27 - 00:38:27:01 Desconocido ¿Cuando me empezó a contar, yo me quede horrorizada, digo pero es que por qué no me lo has dicho antes? ¿O ya es que estoy alucinando? Ya es, es que directamente a mi me parece, me parece un poco. ¿O sea, en este caso tendría que ser denunciable, no? El trato de decir ella cuando cuando es él y hay que dirigirse de esa forma, no como él. 00:38:27:03 - 00:39:35:20 Desconocido Y no sé, o sea, yo denunciaría directamente a tanto al centro como al profesor. Como el director, yo denunciaría, tocaréis. Entonces ha denunciado todo. O sea, es que está todo, es que voy, voy en contra de todos directamente, que directamente el trato es sumamente vejatorio, homófobo. Bueno, en este caso tras mofo, pero. Pero vamos. Y la pillaron siendo que un centro educativo y un docente en este caso sabiendo que es otro y le diga ella no refiriéndose como como ella no y la profesora y eso es disforia, sí, y la profesora que me comenta que mejor le trata constantemente, le trata en femenino y le le repite no soy él no le responde. 00:39:35:22 - 00:40:12:29 Desconocido Y la respuesta al perdona es que con tu cara y tu voz me me lío, me confundes. ¿Cómo le puedes decir eso a una persona que que lo está pasando fatal? ¿Pero es que eso directamente lo que están haciendo es herirle de una forma sobrehumana, o sea, están jugando con con, con él, no? O sea, ya le está poniendo una etiqueta, o sea, me refiero a ti, porque es que con tu cara, con tu cuerpo, o sea, directamente. 00:40:13:06 - 00:41:12:25 Desconocido Vamos a ver, señoras y señores, no se puede, se puede realizar lo que es una transformación, porque el padre no quiere o o no quiere firmar para que se haga el el la transformación del cuerpo de de femenino masculino, cosa que también le producen mucho, muchísimo problema. El pero luego ya indirectamente la mala fe de las personas, no en este caso un docente dirigiéndose claro a otro corrige y dice no soy él y dice bueno, ya me da igual, porque es que con la cara y el cuerpo pues mira, yo te voy a decir una cosa porque yo sí he visto a tu hijo, naturalmente tiene tiene la voz aguda, pero a ver, porque no 00:41:12:25 - 00:41:49:28 Desconocido está hormonados, que es la cosa más normal del mundo. Pero, pero luego a ver reacciones femeninas a lo único que se le ve directamente, pues es el tema de la expresión, no cuando cuando se expresa directamente es la voz. Pero eso no tiene porque etiquetarse. Mira, te voy a ser sincero, porque yo la primera vez que vi a tu hijo, porque yo no sabía la historia, no, naturalmente, yo vi el vídeo y tampoco presté atención. 00:41:49:28 - 00:42:19:05 Desconocido Estaba más atento a lo que a lo que estabas diciendo tú y yo, claro, escuchaba a tu hijo hablar. Digo, yo creo que es gay. ¿Sabes? O sea, yo veía a un chico, pero yo veía a un chico gay. Y luego, claro, cuando me has contado que. ¿Que que era? Era transexual, pues. Pues entonces ya dije bueno, ahora entiendo ciertas cosas. 00:42:19:07 - 00:42:52:16 Desconocido ¿No? Porque se me aparece un chico, o sea, dentro de lo que cabe es visto como un chico, tiene aspecto de chico, pero es que lo que hay es que esta sociedad tiene que concienciar, concienciarse en que existen niños con vulva y niñas con pene. O sea que que un genital no, no, no dicta lo que tú eres. 00:42:52:18 - 00:43:22:21 Desconocido Es que realmente la concienciación como yo pienso que que directamente la tienen que dar los padres, no los padres a los a las personas. ¿Porque si por ejemplo tú en este caso eres eres una persona luchadora, eres valiente, no has aceptado a tu hijo tal como es cuando te ha dicho yo no quiero ser chica que seas chico y has aceptado, lo has valorado como como madre, no? 00:43:22:22 - 00:43:56:06 Desconocido Que es una cosa que que que voy a hacer siempre hincapié en este sentido de que la madre siempre es la que lleva la carga, que el padre únicamente plantar las semillas no sirve para nada, que aunque sea vital. Pero hay veces que los padres son enseñados de una forma en la cual no aceptan a sus hijos, sea del sexo que sean, o la condición sexual que tengan indirectamente también tengo que decir que hay madres, pero hay muchísimos, muy poquitos casos de madres más, más de padres que de madres. 00:43:56:08 - 00:44:37:02 Desconocido Entonces yo creo que pero fíjate que estamos en el siglo 21 y normalmente las personas que que ya tienen una edad o juvenil no, o sea que podríamos decir que que nuestros padres ya están metidos dentro de lo que es una ilusión y deberían de haber enseñado o inculcado un valor sobre sobre nosotros, para, para, para el respeto o el respeto hacia hacia, hacia una persona que que sea entre comillas. 00:44:37:02 - 00:45:08:02 Desconocido Quiero recalcar entre comillas porque para mí no hay diferencia ninguna, no, sino espero en este caso entre comillas, una persona diferente porque antes era chica y ahora quiere ser chico. Yo no veo ninguna diferencia en eso, sinceramente. Yo veo es que es una persona una persona que no se siente a gusto con su cuerpo y quiere cambiar su cuerpo, ya está y está siendo etiquetado de mala forma, totalmente. 00:45:08:04 - 00:45:41:00 Desconocido Entonces, dentro de lo que lo que veo es que la inclusión ni siquiera en lo que es un centro como, como es el caso de este centro del Ferran Ferran Casablanca que está en Sabadell, recordemos todos yo no llevaré a mi hijo ahí. En el caso de que yo tuviera hijos, claro, si no, no lo veo buen centro. 00:45:41:00 - 00:46:09:00 Desconocido ¿No? Sinceramente no, hombre, es que ya con los casos que has comentado no ya tres personas no ya saber si hay más personas dentro de lo que me dices, que habrá más personas que quizá no tengan o la valentía de explicarlo a los padres, o que piensen que los padres no les van a apoyar o que los padres no les apoyen. 00:46:09:08 - 00:47:03:28 Desconocido Es que como cada familia es un mundo, pues seguramente se procesan acompasando las de Neil. Pero es lo que decíamos anteriormente, que dentro de lo que es la familia es lo que le hayan enseñado a sus padres cuando han sido pequeños, que inclusión le han dado dentro de lo que es la sociedad. Pero por ejemplo yo creo que mis padres por ejemplo son muy inclusivos en ese sentido y no ha habido nunca ningún problema en cuestión de inclusividad con con nadie de la familia, ni ni ninguna cosa así porque pero sí te puedo decir que por parte de los abuelos pues se ve un poquito mal, pero hay que entender también que ellos han vivido 00:47:03:28 - 00:47:43:11 Desconocido en otra época y otras situaciones, pero ya los de la generación nueva como que han vivido ya un episodio en la cual deberían de estar acostumbrados a ver a los hombres besarse, las mujeres besarse, a ver a una persona que antes se llamaba Raúl y ahora se llama Fátima, por ejemplo. No, yo creo que deberían de de valorar muchas cosas y pensar sobre todo en el daño que le pueden hacer a la persona en sí con esas degradaciones que realizan en este caso, pues a raíz de la transexualidad. 00:47:43:14 - 00:48:20:03 Desconocido Y vuelvo a repetir nuevamente en un centro educativo, yo no sé los profesores que edad tendrán, no sé si es el centro público, cerrarán, Casa Blanca, tendrá profesores muy mayores o los que los que he visto. De hecho vi una que parecía que era más joven que yo. Yo le echaría, no sé, como que acababa de acabar la carrera de magisterio súper jovencita, luego de 40 y algo, o tal vez cosa así. 00:48:20:04 - 00:49:15:11 Desconocido Tampoco es que hayan abuelitos, o sea que no hay, no hay un profesores que sean mayores. Algún abuelo imagino, pero los que yo he visto no, no eran muy mayores tampoco, la verdad. Um. Sí. ¿Pues me parece también súper raro, no? Porque dentro ya de una formación que les dan académicamente, cuando cuando ellos estudian la docencia, les enseñan lo que es la inclusividad, pero es lo que lo que yo digo, que a lo mejor mucho tema de educación, porque se han sacado una carrera, pero luego que no tienen tipo de conexión no tienen ninguna y es lo que han demostrado que no tienen ni educación, ni empatía, ni humanidad. 00:49:15:13 - 00:49:53:15 Desconocido Hombre, es que es infrahumano. O sea, el daño que te están haciendo a ti y están haciendo a tu hijo me parece, me parece muy increíble. Yo Antes de preparar la entrevista estuvimos hablando ciertas cosas en privado y yo estaba muy muy cabreado. Yo me cabreé bastante y lo veo súper, súper injusto todo, o sea, todo lo que está sufriendo, tanto tú como madre como tu hijo por el tema. 00:49:53:17 - 00:50:28:20 Desconocido Pero fíjate que tu hijo tanto que dicen me da miedo, no me da miedo porque me puede agredir, no quiero dormir con él y te protege. O sea, ahí se demuestra, por ejemplo un gran valor, no de que esconde lo que le está pasando en el colegio, porque tú que tienes depresión desde hace tiempo, me imagino que a raíz de tu ex pareja te protege para que no te sientas aún peor. 00:50:28:23 - 00:50:59:09 Desconocido Exacto. Eso de que los autistas no tienen empatía es un mito y es totalmente erróneo porque si tienen empatía quizá no la demuestren igual que nosotros, pero sí que la tiene. A ver, el tema, el teorema, el tema de la empatía. ¿Yo con con todos las personas autistas no, que además es que no me gusta tampoco llamarles autistas, pero bueno, es el término coloquial, no? 00:50:59:12 - 00:51:38:26 Desconocido Del cual siempre los vamos a hacer referencia. Y no me gusta etiquetar a las personas porque para mí todos son iguales. El tema de la empatía lo que dice es que a lo mejor no lo demuestran también dependiendo del grado, pero siempre muestran siempre muestran ese cariño de una forma u otra. Pues como yo te decía, yo conozco a un chico autista que no habla y yo me puse a leer sobre el autismo y dentro de lo que es el autismo, yo me comunico con este niño que en este caso es un niño. 00:51:38:29 - 00:52:07:09 Desconocido ¿Me comunicó a través de gestos, no? Y bueno, alguna palabra ha dicho y también hacerlo de lo que decías así de los movimientos, así que eso es muy de autista y porque son muy hiperactivos. Lo que pasa es que mucha gente no entiende tampoco lo del autismo, porque el autismo para para mucha gente es un retraso mental y no tiene nada que ver con un retraso mental. 00:52:07:11 - 00:52:45:02 Desconocido No es el el campo del autismo es muy amplio y muy grande. Puede sí que pueden tener retrasos mentales, como que pueden tener altas capacidades. Es que es como si metiéramos a todos los discapacitados físicos en el mismo saco. Claro, pero cuando falta una pierna, otro un brazo es claro, es, es, es, es, es, es una comparación, por ejemplo, es que la gente tiende a etiquetar sin saber sobre, sobre qué tema o sobre qué patología. 00:52:45:02 - 00:53:07:29 Desconocido No, porque por ejemplo, si es si ya un autismo a tener cierto retraso. Que sí, que hay algunos que tienen algún algún retraso, pero no es una deficiencia, es más déficit de atención que otra cosa. Pero por ejemplo, una persona con síndrome de Down, también hay personas con síndrome de Down que ya estamos hablando de algo muy grave. 00:53:07:29 - 00:53:55:08 Desconocido ¿No? ¿Y ellos son docentes, tienen sus carreras, por qué no un autista o una persona autista? De hecho, dicen en muchas ocasiones que una persona autista es luego un psicópata. ¿O sea, es que creo que hay que dar a entender a la gente que una persona autista es una persona normal y que no se va a volver psicópata, que se va a volver psicópata en el caso de que tenga una experiencia que le puede traumatizar y ya entre la psicopatía en la persona, pero también dependiendo de lo que es la educación de de de sus padres, la educación que les que les inculcan y de lo que estén viviendo, no? 00:53:55:10 - 00:54:28:24 Desconocido Pero yo creo que que todas estas cosas que he dicho son mitos, no lo veo como real. Realmente esto es así, tal vez no lo veo, no lo veo como real, de hecho es que no me gusta. ¿Referente al al centro, habéis tenido algún tipo más de contestación? ¿Porque desde luego desde cuando no va no va al centro? 00:54:28:26 - 00:55:00:11 Desconocido Pues desde que lo fui a buscar el jueves que me habló en un intercambio de clase que ya se notaba una muchísima ansiedad y yo creo que quiso prevenir de que no le diera un ataque de ansiedad. Y me habló a mí porque ya no se siente con con ganas, con esa como te digo, no se siente seguro para decírselo a ningún profesor. 00:55:00:11 - 00:55:23:28 Desconocido Ya de oye, que me encuentro mal, llamo a mi madre. Entonces cogió, me habló él en un cambio de clase y fui a buscarlo. Y de hecho la profesora le habló, no pensó que yo era su madre y le habló delante mío súper mal y yo le respondía ella pues de la misma manera que le había hablado a él, vaya. 00:55:24:00 - 00:55:52:03 Desconocido Y yendo yo a buscar, firmando la hoja que te dan conforme te lo lleva, porque está malo y tal. El resto del día le siguieron poniendo faltas injustificadas. Bueno, que no es la primera vez, pero bueno. Pero es que ahí estamos viendo. O sea, en primer lugar la profesora que no sabía que tú, la madre, lo está tratando mal delante de ti. 00:55:52:06 - 00:56:28:27 Desconocido Si, y que como actuaste en ese caso con contra la profesora, porque es que realmente yo. Yo. Mira, se me están. Me están entrando unas ideas horribles. Si yo fuera tú, iría con el teléfono todo el tiempo, grabando conversaciones cada vez que voy al centro. Ya, es que. Es que es. Es que es horroroso, es que es una frustración y una indignación y de todo, es que. 00:56:29:00 - 00:57:00:29 Desconocido Ya, pero. ¿Pero dentro de lo que es la frustración y la indignación, como reaccionaste con contra esa profesora, por ejemplo? Pues ella le dijo o le dijo o me puedo bajar como a conserjería, que es donde yo lo esperaba, que está ahí mi madre y dice yo te acompaño, pero de malas maneras me dijo, y me lo creo porque es que vi cómo le hablaba y le dije está mi madre aquí ya dentro de conserjería. 00:57:01:01 - 00:57:25:01 Desconocido Yo creo que miro y soy muy chiquitita, mido uno 50 igual, pues no me hizo de su madre yo creo y le dijo pero alzando bastante la voz y muy borde miente. No, no, no, tú vete a la sala esa de no sé qué y te esperas ahí sentado. Y entonces yo le respondí No, no, él se viene conmigo que soy su madre y nos vamos ya, madre mía. 00:57:25:03 - 00:57:50:00 Desconocido Entonces ella le respondió ya bajo el tonito y dijo ah, vale. Digo vale, claro, ya, ya, sabiendo que está la autoridad ahí, pues que creo que se le pondrían los pelos de punta a esa profesora, no al al ver que tú, que yo era bastante con todo lo que he visto que está haciendo ese centro, dudo que se les pongan los pelos de punta de nada. 00:57:50:00 - 00:58:23:00 Desconocido Yo creo que no tienen vergüenza ninguno. Sinceramente, yo sigo insistiendo directamente en lo que tendría que haber una denuncia colectiva por parte de de todos los afectados que sois y la máxima visibilidad no a través de redes sociales si es lo que lo está intentando por todos los medios, porque encima es que desde el día 1 no porque decías del jueves estamos a 6 de febrero, desde el día 1 es cuando no va al colegio, con lo cual está perdiendo días de educación. 00:58:23:03 - 00:58:49:26 Desconocido También, dijo, dijo en una ocasión que estaba en una clase que necesitaba ir al servicio porque estaba descompuesto y no le dejaban ir al servicio. Sí, sí, no le dijeron que no y pues él se fue corriendo obviamente porque se lo iba a meter sus necesidades encima y por eso es lo que pone aquí en el correo, como que falta a la autoridad o algo así. 00:58:49:26 - 00:59:11:06 Desconocido ¿No respeto a la autoridad, como que no respeta la autoridad, pero qué autoridad hay ahí? Si la única autoridad es un policía que no estamos en los años 70 ni en los años 80, cuando los profesores eran autoritarios y nos tenemos que levantar incluso de no sé si tú has vivido eso, pero yo sí. Yo cuando iba al colegio me tenía que levantar cada vez que entraba un profesor. 00:59:11:08 - 00:59:44:03 Desconocido Bueno, yo sí, pero porque fui a uno concertado de monjas y aparte de eso, tenemos que respetar también. Sí, a la mujer también. Pero bueno, dentro de lo que es no son considerados ninguna autoridad, o sea, son nuestros tutores. O sea, podríamos decir que son tutores legales dentro de lo que cabe, pero de turno tuve ganas de llevarme una una llamada constantemente que te está entrando. 00:59:44:03 - 01:00:23:00 Desconocido Una llamada constantemente. ¿Sí, sí, vale, no te preocupes, Yo cuando como veo que se va, se van en alguna ocasión la señal, pero me has escuchado lo que quiero decir no? O sea que no sé qué autoridad es si un docente, porque para mí no es ninguna autoridad, es una persona que está enseñando a alguien, pero no a alguien autoritario, que para ya la autoridad, pues ya están las autoridades competentes, en este caso en Cataluña, los Mossos d'Esquadra y ella y los mismos padres son los autoritarios, pero no una tercera persona. 01:00:23:03 - 01:00:53:19 Desconocido Pues no sé, no sé si es que este instituto se ha quedado en la época de Franco y no, no ha llegado a este año. Bueno, eso. ¿Por eso te preguntaba antes que si era un colegio católico, no? Porque mira, tú y yo hemos coincidido en algo en que sea un colegio de monjas. No sé qué edad tienes tú, pero bueno, yo tengo, yo tengo 44 y a mí me hacían Ya te digo que levantarme de la silla y como si fueran ahí. 01:00:53:21 - 01:01:21:09 Desconocido Sí, el trato también era un poco horroroso y bastante hostil. En mi caso, por lo menos en el mío, El mío no, el mío bastante fuerte podríamos decir. Bueno, hostil, también hostil. Y encima que soy zurdo y me crearon una una dislexia, porque si lo hago con la mano derecha me ataban la mano derecha contra contra la espalda. 01:01:21:15 - 01:01:47:16 Desconocido Pero bueno, son. Son épocas en las que se permitía hasta dar collejas y capones y cosas así. Ahora no está muy permitido ni permitido, pero yo creo que hay ciertas cosas que no se tienen que permitir, como es el trato que está recibiendo tu hijo y varias personas más de este centro. Ferrán Casanova, Ferran Casanova, Sabadell. Es horrible. 01:01:47:16 - 01:02:18:18 Desconocido Exacto. Es que no hace falta que te den un capón o un guantazo porque el maltrato psicológico puede hacer mucho más daño que un guantazo. Y las secuelas que que le puede dejar son son fatales porque de hecho ya no quiere. No se ve competente para un bachillerato y ahora ya estamos buscando ciclos de grado medio de artístico. 01:02:18:18 - 01:02:48:06 Desconocido También el bachillerato tendría que hacer en ese mismo centro, no es que a ese mismo centro él ya no quiere volver, o sea, ya tiene miedo a los compañeros, miedo a los profesores. Hombre, claro, si te están haciendo el vacío, te están haciendo bullying, te están diciendo cosas, transformas constantemente, es te discriminan, te marginan. ¿Tú querrías estar en un sitio así? 01:02:48:06 - 01:03:26:08 Desconocido Y creo que nadie como naturalmente, o sea, dentro de dentro de lo que de lo que es la psicología que te está recibiendo tu hijo por parte de ese centro. Lo que pasa es que que yo por eso digo, no sé si al bachiller luego lo hacen dentro de ese mismo centro y no hay alguna otra alternativa. Estabas diciendo algún algún grado no, pero dentro, si es que a mí se me quitaron las ganas de ser del arte y del todo directamente con lo que estoy, con lo que estaría sufriendo. 01:03:26:08 - 01:03:53:16 Desconocido Yo es que el problema que yo tengo es que me meto mucho en el en en cómo pensar a la otra persona, entonces es como que se como que lo estoy viviendo directamente, lo que lo que puede sentir tu hijo, no en este caso. Y mi pregunta entiendo el miedo también, claro, el miedo a los profesores, el miedo a a a los alumnos. 01:03:53:19 - 01:04:30:15 Desconocido Pero si él quiere estudiar esa carrera tiene que empezar un bachiller. ¿No hay un centro en Sabadell donde pueda estudiar esa carrera que no sea ese, eh? ¿Hay otro? Sí, hay otro sitio que hacen el bachillerato artístico, pero ha sido tanto el machaque psicológico que le han hecho de hacerle sentir inferior, que le han quitado la ilusión. Lo que te digo que ya no se ve capacitado para el bachillerato y ya quiere ir a un grado medio. 01:04:30:18 - 01:05:02:14 Desconocido Bueno, para el grado medio va a ser lo mismo, o sea, va a estar con con gente, va a estar con, con, con también profesores, con lo cual va a ser lo mismo. Yo directamente estar en otro centro. Si está en el centro, pero por eso te preguntaba que el bachiller creo que lo estudié en otro centro, no en otro centro que no tenga que ver con el Ferrán Casablanca. 01:05:02:16 - 01:05:30:09 Desconocido Sí, pero no quiere ya bachillerato. Es como que no lo sé. Lo han traumatizado con el bachillerato. Bueno, tal como lo han tratado es que es normal que lo traumatizan. O sea, es que han. Mira, nosotros llegamos a este, a este mundo para. Para cumplir una misión, la misiones, vivir nuestra vida, estudiar que es nuestro primer trabajo y encima no lo cobramos. 01:05:30:11 - 01:06:02:00 Desconocido Hay veces que en alguna ocasión lo lo pagamos nosotros mismos. Luego seguir estudiando para intentar sacarte una carrera y ser algo en la vida, trabajar y en algunos casos muchos trabajos que no tienen nada que ver con lo que tú has estudiado y jubilarte y ya está. Ese es el sentido de la vida y ese es el cumplimiento que tendríamos que tener todos, pero sea con el problema que tengamos. 01:06:02:00 - 01:06:33:16 Desconocido ¿Aunque bueno, vuelvo a recalcar que yo no veo ningún problema en que tu hijo tenga una patología que es un TEA, pero el problema lo tienen los que vendrás de fuera, no? O que no conocen a tu hijo, no lo conocen únicamente de manera estudiantil, que incluso has dicho que saca buenas notas, que ya con el trauma que tiene el chico directamente yo sacaría ceros. 01:06:33:18 - 01:07:05:23 Desconocido ¿Te lo digo en serio, no? En primero de bachillerato sí que han sacado muy malas notas. El tema de las buenas notas me refería a cuando le le dieron la discapacidad se basaron en sus notas y ahí era todo excelentes y entonces pues por eso le dieron un 37%, sumándole el déficit de atención, la imperatividad alto grado y el autismo. 01:07:05:25 - 01:07:31:09 Desconocido Sí, pero dentro de lo que de lo que estábamos hablando. No has dicho lo de lo de las notas, no las notas, que es algo muy importante y ya con déficit de atención e hiperactividad. ¿Cuando la persona es hiperactiva y tiene déficit de atención que que no aprende de una forma rápida y aun así saca buenas notas con buenas notas no? 01:07:31:11 - 01:08:05:03 Desconocido Y de ahí en cosa ya de sacar buenas notas en primero de bachillerato, pues ya ha sido lo peor. En cuestión de notificación, pero quizás por lo herido que se sienta, no realmente a raíz del trato vejatorio por parte de los docentes y por parte de este centro. Y ya con lo de la cartita de favor no a la carta, eso es que es para ponerla en un museo directamente. 01:08:05:05 - 01:08:36:18 Desconocido Bueno, y la conversación con el director es que parecía que hablaba, no lo sé, de Bin Laden, no de mí o yo. Yo es que me quedé alucinada, pero es que alucinada porque hubieron dos conversaciones en la revista Tu hijo. Sí, sí, o sea. Pero es que flipante la conversación, alucinante. Que era un peligro que ellos no podían cargar con ese peligro. 01:08:36:18 - 01:09:16:18 Desconocido El peligro número uno. Y yo diciendo peligro número uno. Pues sí, yo le dije contacta con el otro centro, con el Arrahona, pregúntales, pregúntale como fue el viaje a Roma Si quieres te paso el número de psiquiatría y contacta con ellos. Nada. ¿O sea no, o sea, pero y a ti? ¿A ti cómo? Como cuando tú hablas con un director y que te dice que es el peligro número uno más, más la de las degradaciones que haya tenido, que habrían grabado también la conversación en ese. 01:09:16:25 - 01:09:53:04 Desconocido En ese sentido, yo grabé la segunda por todo lo que escuché en la primera, pero la segunda no sé si algo se olía porque se iba un poco. Contradice en uno. Ya no fue lo mismo, ya no era peligro en la segunda y sí seguía siendo peligro. ¿Pero en el tema de claro, yo le iba diciendo hombre, el otro día me estuviste diciendo de que tenía a toda clase acojonada, que tal? 01:09:53:06 - 01:10:22:16 Desconocido Y él me decía bueno, es que los niños dicen muchas cosas, a los niños dicen muchas cosas, tal. Y yo le contesté no, los niños dicen muchas cosas, no, es que yo pienso que directamente te lo estás inventando tú. ¿Y me dijo Los niños podrán decir muchas cosas, pero son niños no? Pero para eso como son autoritarios, no como, como si entre comillas tendrían dar ese toque de atención hacia los niños. 01:10:22:22 - 01:10:51:24 Desconocido Pero ya decir que tu hijo es un peligro porque muy de repente ahí me dijo que él no había dicho eso, que él no, que ni ni que era un peligro, ni que tenía a los niños acojonados. Cuando hacía un minuto que decía que los niños dicen cosas por los niños, a los cinco minutos ya no decían nada, pero a la carta de la carta la remito, No, porque la carta sabe ya la información. 01:10:51:24 - 01:11:33:14 Desconocido O sea, si dentro de la contradicción que está teniendo este director, si la carta también es contradictoria, entonces, o sea que quien dice la verdad, lo que lo que expresa la carta que me imagino que será certificada o lo que expresa el director, o sea, si en la carta ya, ya pone por ciertas razones en las que están degradando a tu hijo, por, por, por, porque tienen miedo, porque entre comillas es un psicópata que tiene a todo el mundo acojonado. 01:11:33:17 - 01:12:04:28 Desconocido Es raro que yo diga acojonado por aquí, pero bueno, pero es que ya es el cabreo que me da el poder escuchar esto, porque claro, tienes la versión que que no grababas durante la primera cita, pero en la segunda cita ya grabasteis y a lo mejor se lo estaba oliendo naturalmente y que luego la carta está diciendo lo mismo que te dijo en la primera la primera vez que estuviste con él, con el director. 01:12:05:01 - 01:12:42:03 Desconocido Sí, digo ya porque yo he tenido el el honor de de ver la carta y de saber directamente lo que lo que pone dentro de dentro de ella. Sí, sí, sí. Y en esa segunda reunión, como enseño en el Departamento de Educación, llamemosle, eh, se puso en contacto con el en la segunda reunión, la opción que me dio el director, supongo que porque se lo diría el inspector fue que mi hijo podía ir si iba yo como persona de apoyo. 01:12:42:06 - 01:13:09:23 Desconocido ¿Cuando mi hijo tiene una tarjeta de discapacidad donde pone que no necesita tarjeta persona de apoyo, pero pero directamente a ver, aunque no necesite tarjeta de apoyo, te refieres a lo del viaje a País Vasco o al país Vasco? ¿Claro, y yo no podía ir porque aparte de mi hijo tengo una niña de ocho años que hago? Dejo a mi hija sola en casa, me la llevo también y que pierda clase. 01:13:09:26 - 01:13:32:06 Desconocido ¿Es que a ver, pero pero es que directamente si necesita de una persona, aunque en la tarjeta dice que es totalmente funcional, que no necesita, que a lo mejor necesita un toque de atención para que se tome algún medicamento, no? Porque se puede olvidar. Puede ser recordar que si se ha tomado la pastilla, que la pastilla para el tema de la hiperactividad y el déficit de atención y para la depresión. 01:13:32:08 - 01:14:23:26 Desconocido Y para eso tienes que ir a País Vasco a acompañarle. Y el docente que es lo que hace, se toca los huevos. Es que claro, como no les pagan por irse de viaje, eso no lo cobran. Pues que pues entonces yo entonces clientes, lo de mi hijo cuando tienen 30 niños más a ver directamente entonces que si no lo van a cobrar ese viaje, pues que no organicen viajes de fin de curso, no, no Y es que encima no es de fin de curso, es que es un viaje de estudios donde de ese viaje de estudios le han puesto deberes, que tiene que hacer un diario de su viaje en el País Vasco. 01:14:23:29 - 01:14:57:18 Desconocido ¿Alguien me puede decir que diario va a hacer mi hijo del País Vasco? Porque como no sea como no sea el diario de Noa, me parece increíble. ¿No va a escribir tu hijo El Diario de Noa en vez del diario del Vasco? Porque. Pero es que necesariamente, o sea, yo me estoy quedando flipando e investigando, flipando con con el tema del viaje por el simple hecho de que un profesor no cobre el viaje es que también estaba en su jornada laboral. 01:14:57:18 - 01:15:51:14 Desconocido No podríamos decir tendría que cobrar sus horas lectivas, no si sus horas que ellos viven muy bien, que ellos cobran incluso estando de vacaciones y que por lo que cobran de nuestros impuestos y obviamente yo no pago los impuestos para que maltraten psicológicamente a mi hijo. Naturalmente, dentro de lo que son esos, esos impuestos que directamente están están cobrando a raíz de nosotros, deberían de tener más empatía y más tacto y más cuidado hacia hacia la persona en este caso hacia tu hijo, y decir que no va a cuidar de 30 de 30 personas, pero es que no está cuidando de 30 personas únicamente es mandar un recordatorio de si se ha tomado una medicación. 01:15:51:17 - 01:16:21:02 Desconocido Yo creo que no cuesta nada preguntarlo. Si te has tomado la medicación para la hiperactividad, ya está en punto, ya disfruta del viaje, disfruta del País Vasco, que es muy bonito y hace mucho frío, pero no lo entiendo. ¿Y que tengas que ir tú que dices? Claro, tú tienes tu vida, tú tienes una hija que has hecho ocho años, creo que ocho años, y tienes una hija de ocho años que tiene también que ir al colegio. 01:16:21:07 - 01:17:07:11 Desconocido No la puedes dejar sola, obviamente, porque un niño de ocho años no es, no es, no es independiente, no es, no sabe cocinar, no sabe hacer gran, gran cosa. Entonces me parece, me parece increíble que la contestación que te den eso y encima más. Si es una cosa que que directamente tiene que ver con con el estudio en el cual tiene que hacer un diario o tiene que hacer un trabajo sobre ello, pues me parece como una falta de empatía, una cosa vergonzosa, directamente, porque lo que dices tú que se va a inventar no va a escribir. 01:17:07:14 - 01:17:42:18 Desconocido Como te digo, el diario de Noa y también hacen un concurso donde puede participar si quieren, que le dan al ganador un cheque de ábaco a la mejor fotografía hecha en el País Vasco. Pues nada, pues yo siento que estando ahí, en lo alto de mí, como de tiempo sea, es que claramente se está viendo que se están riendo. 01:17:42:18 - 01:18:17:24 Desconocido O sea, no es que se están riendo de ti, de tu hijo, se están riendo de todos en general, o sea, dan un concurso. Pues nada que que la inteligencia artificial no directamente y. En vez de sacar una foto al País Vasco, saca una foto a lo que sea, a algo que es que no va del no conozco Barcelona solo entonces pues que saque una foto de ahí y que diga al GPS conviértelo en el País Vasco y ya está. 01:18:17:25 - 01:18:53:00 Desconocido A la directamente ella. Pues un premio que en realidad me da es lo digo irónicamente porque es que me parece la gilipollez más absurda que puede haber en este mundo. Veo que todo está tan injusto en este centro, en el Zárraga, Ferrán Casanova. No voy a hablar de Casablanca, vale, perdón, Casablanca, Ferrán, Casablanca, que no me canso. Es que me dan ganas hasta de llamarlos ahora mismo a preguntarles, a ver que. 01:18:53:03 - 01:19:49:23 Desconocido Que qué me cuentan. Me dan ganas de ir hasta por saber directamente, pero esa trucada no a quien lo llame. ¿Espero cualquier cosa porque? Porque me parece todo tan tan injusto, tan irrisorio, tan subrealista y menos real. Hombre, es que es que es surrealista, porque es que volvemos al principio estamos entrando casi como. Como en un bucle. No es un centro que es inclusivo y dentro de esa inclusión no se, no hay inclusión realmente hacia hacia una persona de ningún tipo, no hay ningún tipo ni de género ni de neuro divergencia, ni de absolutamente nada. 01:19:49:25 - 01:20:25:22 Desconocido O sea, no, no se donde está ahí la inclusividad, inclusividad, inclusividad que he visto es la de la estupidez, ahí otra no he visto, claro. Y luego ya pues el trato que recibes tanto tú como tu hijo, los problemas psicológicos, es que yo directamente ese centro lo. Vuelvo a repetir nuevamente dentro de este bucle en el que estamos entrando nuevamente, es poner una denuncia al centro. 01:20:25:24 - 01:20:50:18 Desconocido Es que yo iría hasta la Generalitat, sí, si hiciera falta o no, si ya lo he hecho también ha también ha sido la Generalitat. Sí, sí, no paro y el tiempo con mi depresión a full. Pero no paró de mover el tema de mi hijo. ¿Y en la Generalitat te han dicho alguna cosa o de alguna manera había dado respuesta? 01:20:50:21 - 01:21:16:16 Desconocido Porque ya sabemos que que esto va más lento que el caballo al malo. ¿El tema de la justicia, el tema de quién? Pero, pero me imagino. Bueno, si ya se va a lo que es la Generalitat, me imagino que y también me he puesto en contacto con la alcaldesa de Sabadell, puesto que en el Ayuntamiento de Sabadell, en pocas palabras, me dijeron que le sabía muy mal lo que me pasaba, pero que es el abusaba. 01:21:16:16 - 01:21:48:13 Desconocido Vamos, que eso era cosa de ensenyament. Digo vale ya, pero bueno, es un centro público respecto a Sabadell dentro de que cabe igual que hacen visitas por ejemplo al ayuntamiento para ver cómo se gobierna. Yo creo que la alcaldesa debería de darse también una visita por el centro para, ver cómo tratan a los alumnos. Por eso ya me he puesto en contacto, ya no con el Ayuntamiento. 01:21:48:13 - 01:22:28:04 Desconocido Aparte el la Comisión de Educación, dime la Consellería de Educación o si Ensenyament viene a hacer a ese señor en la mayoría sí, vale, pero también habrá algún algún regidor, no un un regidor especializado en educación fuera de Ensenyament. Es que tampoco. Tampoco te sé decir porque es la primera vez que me veo en esta eh. En esto envuelta. 01:22:28:06 - 01:23:10:08 Desconocido FA Voy, voy buscando todos sitios, voy preguntando, voy recopilando información como puedo y haciendo todo todo lo que veo al alcance de mi mano. Ya, pero a ver, ahí demuestra si lo que es la la valenciano, porque has ido a diferentes organizaciones para para dar voz y dar visibilidad a lo que es el caso que que es preocupante y es alarmista directamente o porque se ha creado lo que es una alarma a raíz de, lo que es tu hijo. 01:23:10:08 - 01:23:57:04 Desconocido ¿Pero fíjate cómo son las cosas, ha sido algún medio de comunicación? No es lo que me lo que quedó. ¿No se te ha ocurrido? Pues yo creo que deberías de acudir a un medio de comunicación, aunque te voy a decir también que los medios de comunicación están muy politizados ya. Entonces, dentro de lo que hay, de lo que es el medio de comunicación, puede salirte bien la jugada o puede salir mal dependiendo Les gusta mucho el morbo, eso sí, pero se rigen también por por mucha política es y ya dentro de lo que es un medio, pero yo creo que un medio sobre todo catalán en este caso, o dar visibilidad a nivel nacional como 01:23:57:05 - 01:24:54:12 Desconocido como en este caso, a través de este podcast se va a dar visibilidad con todos los los oyentes y que tiene, pero yo creo que es imprescindible que esto salga a la luz y que el Ferran casa no va a cerrar sus puertas. Sí, totalmente que y que le hagan una inspección y. Y que vean si realmente están cualificados para estar o donde están, porque por tener simplemente la carrera no creo que estén cualificados para tratar con que al final son niños y la mente de un niño es muy frágil como en la mente del niño. 01:24:54:15 - 01:25:20:18 Desconocido ¿Pero es que luego también en la mente del padre, porque el padre es el que el que está sufriendo todo el problema y todo el tránsito no? En este caso basta. Mira ya al final me dejo en un segundo plano. Yo siempre digo que que a mí que me hagan lo que quieran, que que me da igual. Pero mis hijos son intocables, tanto tú como como la pequeño no sea. 01:25:20:19 - 01:26:01:24 Desconocido ¿No? Ya, pero bueno, una son intocables porque eres la madre, la protectora, que es lo que lo que te he dicho directamente de que de que cuando tú tienes un hijo creas ese vínculo. No, tú eres quien lleva la carga durante los nueve meses del hijo. Entonces tus hijos te duelen y tu morirías por tus hijos. Podríamos decir no como cualquier madre, claro, pero, pero es que no solamente el problema está en tu hijo, no, el problema también está en ti, también te afecta a ti directamente. 01:26:01:24 - 01:26:43:28 Desconocido ¿Entonces yo creo que tanto tu hijo como tú necesitáis esa ayuda que es primordial para para poder arreglar un poco no? Y sonreír directamente dentro de lo que de lo que es para, para que otro, por ejemplo, siga con la ilusión que tenía de seguir con una carrera artística, que además la carrera artística es preciosa. Sí, lo general le animaría directamente a que a que siguiera es ese camino, pero tiene que tiene que aprender también a que lo van a etiquetar y lo van a juzgar siempre. 01:26:44:01 - 01:27:41:23 Desconocido Si yo yo le digo que ahora lo lo está pasando mal, bueno, lo estamos pasando mal y que nos queda, aunque esto simplemente es una batalla más de las muchas que nos quedan, pero que a la larga todo esto no nos va a hacer más fuerte, sobre todo a él. ¿Efectivamente, la valentía está en la fortaleza, entonces pues, pues ella se nos va el tiempo del programa ha sido un verdadero y un verdadero placer estar con contigo y que cuentas pues hayas contado ese ese testimonio y haremos todo lo posible por darle la máxima visibilidad a lo que está ocurriendo con con otro y espero que dentro de poco tengamos unas buenas noticias, no? 01:27:41:23 - 01:28:13:09 Desconocido Y que pues si no cierran el Ferran Casanova, pues Casablanca, Casablanca no, Casablanca. Me quedo con lo de Casanova, que a ver si va a haber un casanova pobre y le va a caer todo. Pues el Casablanca, el Ferran Casablanca sí. Si se cierra o le hacen una inspección directamente, esperemos que no, pues sea se ha valido el testimonio que que has dicho Jueces a la cárcel. 01:28:13:09 - 01:30:01:02 Desconocido Muchas gracias. Y desde aquí pues muchísima fuerza también. Muchas gracias. Un besito para ti y un besito también para para Otto. Pues hasta aquí llegamos, señoras y señores. Es un tema muy muy candente, muy muy horrible. Y bueno, pues esperemos que la cosa vaya solucionando. Nos vemos la semana que viene aquí en el punto de vista.

It is a battleaxe block containing 2 units. I am looking at the unit at the back. What are the advantages and disadvantages of buying a unit at the back?","completion":"Buying a unit at the back of a battleaxe block has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Advantages: 1. Privacy: Units at the back of a battleaxe block usually offer more privacy as they are away from the street noise and passersby. 2. Security: Being further away from the street entrance may offer more security and less risk of break-ins. 3. Peace and quiet: Units at the back of a battleaxe block are typically quieter and more peaceful compared to units at the front. Disadvantages: 1. Access: Units at the back may have limited or narrow access, which can make moving in and out more difficult. 2. Natural light and ventilation: Units at the back may receive less natural light and ventilation compared to units at the front. 3. Resale value: Units at the back of a battleaxe block may have lower resale value compared to units at the front, as some buyers prefer units with street frontage. Ultimately, the decision to buy a unit at the back of a battleaxe block will depend on your personal preferences and priorities. Consider factors such as privacy, security, access, natural light, and resale value before making a decision. It is also recommended to consult with a real estate agent or property expert for more tailored advice based on the specific property you are considering."},{"prompt":"Write a story about a man who eats a brick after being dared to, and just as his teeth break, they repair themselves, allowing him to do impossible things, He becomes superhuman","completion":"There was a man named Mark who was known for being a bit of a daredevil. He loved to push the limits and never backed down from a challenge. So when his friends dared him to eat a brick, he didn't hesitate. As he bit into the hard, solid brick, he felt his teeth crack and break. The pain was excruciating, but Mark refused to show any sign of weakness. Just as he thought he couldn't bear the pain any longer, something miraculous happened. His teeth began to repair themselves, slowly but surely, until they were as good as new. Mark was astonished. He had never experienced anything like this before. He decided to test out his new abilities and found that he could do things that seemed impossible. He could lift heavy objects with ease, run faster than he ever thought possible, and even jump to incredible heights. Word of Mark's superhuman abilities spread quickly, and soon he became a legend in his town. People would come from far and wide to witness his extraordinary feats. Some were in awe of him, while others feared him, believing him to be some sort of freak of nature. But Mark didn't care what others thought. He was reveling in his newfound abilities and was determined to use them for good. He became a hero, using his powers to help those in need and fight against injustice. As time went on, Mark's fame grew, and he was hailed as a superhuman, a modern-day superhero. And all because he had dared to eat a brick and discovered the incredible power within himself."},{"prompt":"Be my real estate expert. Buying a property. It is a battleaxe block containing 2 units. I am looking at the unit at the back. What are the advantages and disadvantages of buying a unit at the back?","completion":"Certainly! A battleaxe block, for those who might not be familiar, is a term used in some places like Australia to describe a piece of land that sits behind another property and is typically accessed by a long driveway. The term comes from the shape of the block, which resembles the shape of a battleaxe. Now, here are some advantages and disadvantages of buying a unit at the back of a battleaxe block: **Advantages:** 1. **Privacy:** Being located at the back often offers more privacy from street noise and pedestrians since it's set back from the main road. 2. **Safety and Security:** The position away from the street may provide a sense of security, as it's less accessible to passersby, which can be a deterrent for potential burglaries. 3. **Less Traffic Noise:** Being further away from the street means that there might be less traffic noise infiltrating your home. 4. **Possibly Larger Outdoor Space:** Sometimes, rear units on battleaxe blocks have larger outdoor spaces compared to front units or street-front properties. 5. **Community Feel:** If the front unit is occupied by friendly neighbors, this can create a sense of community and shared interest in the upkeep of the common driveway and garden areas. **Disadvantages:** 1. **Access:** The long driveway may make it more cumbersome for visitors to find your home, and could potentially pose issues for deliveries, emergency services, or when moving furniture in and out. 2. **Limited Street Appeal:** The property may lack street visibility, which could impact future resale value or rental appeal. 3. **Restricted Parking:** There could be limited parking options, particularly for guests, if the driveway access is narrow or if there's a shared parking agreement with the front unit. 4. **Maintenance Responsibility:** There may be shared or additional responsibilities for maintaining the driveway, garden areas, and any shared utilities. 5. **Potential for Dispute:** Living in close quarters with neighbors can sometimes lead to disputes over shared spaces or issues such as noise. 6. **Insurance Considerations:** In some cases, insurance premiums might be higher for a rear unit on a battleaxe block due to increased risks associated with limited access. Before purchasing the unit at the back, you should also consider: - The specific terms of the strata or body corporate agreements, if applicable - Any easements or covenants on the property that could affect your use of the land - The quality of the construction and any potential for disputes with the unit in front - Your own lifestyle and whether the potential limitations of a back unit align with it And, as always, it's prudent to conduct a thorough due diligence with respect to building inspections, the local property market, legal considerations, and financing options before committing to a purchase."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Buying a property. It is a battleaxe block containing 2 units. I am looking at the unit at the back. What are the advantages and disadvantages of buying a unit at the back?","completion":"As your real estate expert, I can provide insight into the pros and cons of buying a unit at the back of a battleaxe block. Here's an overview: **Advantages:** 1. **Privacy:** Units at the back often offer more privacy as they are typically further away from the street and less exposed to passing traffic and pedestrians. 2. **Quieter:** Being positioned away from the road can mean less noise from traffic, which leads to a quieter living environment. 3. **Safety:** Sometimes, being less visible and accessible from the street can offer a sense of security from potential break-ins. 4. **Exclusive Use of Land:** You might have exclusive use of the rear yard, which can be a benefit if you value outdoor space. 5. **Community Feel:** In some battleaxe block developments, there can be a sense of community with your neighbor(s) due to the shared driveway or access. 6. **Potentially Lower Cost:** Depending on the market, units at the back may be priced slightly lower due to the perceived inconvenience of access. **Disadvantages:** 1. **Access:** The main disadvantage often is access. You may have to share a driveway or have a longer private driveway, which can be less convenient for guests, moving furniture, etc. 2. **Limited Street Appeal:** Your home may lack the street appeal of a typical frontage home, which could influence resale value and first impressions. 3. **Potential for Disputes:** With shared access or driveways, there's potential for disputes with the front unit over maintenance, parking, and usage. 4. **Light and Ventilation:** Depending on the design and orientation, some back units may have less natural light or inferior ventilation compared to front units. 5. **Resale Challenges:** The unique nature of battleaxe blocks can be a deterrent to some buyers, which might affect resale potential and time on the market. 6. **Maintenance of Driveway and Services:** You could be partly responsible for the upkeep of shared services and the driveway, which can add to your costs and responsibilities. 7. **Reduced Visibility for Home Businesses:** If you're considering operating a business from home, a rear unit may not be as visible or accessible to clients. When considering purchasing a property on a battleaxe block, it's crucial to review the strata agreement (if applicable), easements, and any shared service arrangements. It's also a good idea to speak to the current owners or neighbors to understand any communal lifestyle considerations and to have a real estate attorney or conveyancer review the legalities of the property. Ensure that a thorough inspection is done to check for any unique structural or maintenance issues that might arise from the property's layout and to assess the quality of soundproofing and privacy in the living environment."},{"prompt":"difference between parameters and arguments in javascript","completion":"In programming, particularly in JavaScript, the terms \\"parameters\\" and \\"arguments\\" are often used in the context of functions, and they refer to different things, although they are closely related. 1. Parameters: Parameters are the variables that are defined by the function that receives them. Think of parameters as placeholders in a function definition. When you define a function, you specify parameters to indicate what kind of input the function expects. These are the names you put in the function definition. For example: \`\`\`javascript function add(x, y) { return x + y; } \`\`\` Here, \`x\` and \`y\` are parameters of the \`add\` function. 2. Arguments: Arguments, on the other hand, are the actual values or expressions passed to the function when it is invoked. When you call a function, you provide arguments, which are the data that get passed into the function's parameters. For example, when calling the \`add\` function: \`\`\`javascript let result = add(5, 10); \`\`\` The values \`5\` and \`10\` are arguments that are passed to the function. In summary, when defining a function, the variables in the function's declaration are parameters. When calling a function, the values you provide are arguments. The arguments are assigned to the function's parameters in order, and the function executes with these specific values."},{"prompt":"function showMessage(from, text) { from = '*' + from + '*'; // make \\"from\\" look nicer alert( from + ': ' + text ); } let from = \\"Ann\\"; showMessage(from, \\"Hello\\"); // *Ann*: Hello // the value of \\"from\\" is the same, the function modified a local copy alert( from ); // Ann can you pplease explain step by step what desthe code indicates","completion":"Certainly! Let's walk through the code step by step. 1. The function definition: \`\`\`javascript function showMessage(from, text) { from = '*' + from + '*'; // make \\"from\\" look nicer alert( from + ': ' + text ); } \`\`\` Here, we have a function called \`showMessage\` with two parameters: \`from\` and \`text\`. Inside the function, the \`from\` parameter is modified by adding an asterisk before and after its value. Then, an \`alert\` is displayed showing the modified \`from\` value and the \`text\` that was passed, separated by a colon. 2. Variable declaration outside the function: \`\`\`javascript let from = \\"Ann\\"; \`\`\` This line creates a variable named \`from\` in the global scope and assigns it the string \`\\"Ann\\"\`. 3. The function call: \`\`\`javascript showMessage(from, \\"Hello\\"); // *Ann*: Hello \`\`\` The function \`showMessage\` is called with two arguments: the variable \`from\` with the value \`\\"Ann\\"\` and the string \`\\"Hello\\"\`. Here's what happens during this call: - The value of the global \`from\` variable (\`\\"Ann\\"\`) is passed to the function, but remember that the function only receives the value; it doesn't have access to the outer variable itself. - Inside the function, a local copy of the \`from\` parameter is created with the value \`\\"Ann\\"\`. - The function then modifies this local copy by adding asterisks, so it becomes \`\\"*Ann*\\"\`. - Finally, an \`alert\` pops up displaying \`*Ann*: Hello\`. 4. After the function call, we check the value of \`from\` again: \`\`\`javascript alert( from ); // Ann \`\`\` This \`alert\` statement is showing that the global variable \`from\` still holds its original value \`\\"Ann\\"\`. The modification that occurred within the \`showMessage\` function affected only the local \`from\` parameter and did not change the global \`from\` variable. So, step by step, the code behaves as follows: - Defines a function that can modify a 'from' string and combine it with a 'text' string to display an alert. - It establishes a globally scoped variable named 'from'. - Calls the function with the global 'from' variable and a hardcoded 'text' string. The function modifies its local parameter, not the outside variable. - Shows that the external 'from' variable remains unchanged by displaying an alert with the original 'from' value.

Incorrect Type Declaration \`uint156\`: \`\`\`solidity (uint156 x, uint256 y) = f(); \`\`\` In Solidity, \`uint256\` is a valid type representing an unsigned integer of 256 bits. However, \`uint156\` is not a standard type. Solidity uses predefined bit sizes for unsigned integers that are multiples of 8 (e.g., \`uint8\`, \`uint16\`, ..., \`uint256\`). To correct it, you should use a valid type, such as \`uint256\`. 2. Misnamed Variable \`final\`: \`\`\`solidity uint256 final; \`\`\` In Solidity and many other programming languages, \`final\` is a reserved keyword. It is used in contract inheritance to prevent functions from being overridden. You cannot use \`final\` as a variable name. You need to rename the variable to something that is not a reserved keyword. 3. Function \`f\` Returns Three Values, but Only Two Are Captured: \`\`\`solidity function f() public pure returns (uint256, bool, uint256) { return (7, true, 2); } (uint156 x, uint256 y) = f(); // Trying to capture only two values from f \`\`\` The function \`f\` is defined to return three values, but in function \`g\`, an attempt to destructure the returned values only captures two of them. You need to capture all three returned values, or explicitly ignore the ones you don't need. Here's how you can ignore the middle value (if that's the intention): \`\`\`solidity (uint256 x,, uint256 y) = f(); \`\`\` The middle comma indicates that the second return value should be ignored. After addressing these issues, the corrected contract code would look like this: \`\`\`solidity // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.20; contract C { uint256 finalValue; // Renamed variable function f() public pure returns (uint256, bool, uint256) { return (7, true, 2); } function g() public { // Correct type and capture all return values (ignoring the second one) (uint256 x,, uint256 y) = f(); (x, y) = (y, x); // Swap values if that's the intention finalValue = x; } } \`\`\` Make sure to adjust the swapping of \`x\` and \`y\` if that's part of your intended logic. If you decide to store only the last value returned from \`f\`, then the assignment to \`finalValue\` would not need a swap. After making the above changes, the contract should compile successfully."},{"prompt":"// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.20; contract C { uint256 final; function f() public pure returns (uint256, bool, uint256) { return (7, true, 2); } function g() public { (uint256 x, uint256 y) = f(); (x, y) = (y, x); final = x; } } What is the reason for the compilation failure of the provided contract?","completion":"The Solidity code you've provided will fail to compile due to two main reasons: 1. Incorrect naming of state variable as \`final\`: As mentioned previously, \`final\` is a reserved keyword in many programming languages; however, in Solidity's context, the use of \`final\` as a variable name is syntactically valid, but it's generally a good practice to avoid naming variables that could be potentially reserved in future versions of the language or lead to confusion. So while \`final\` is not currently a reserved keyword in Solidity as of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, it's advisable to rename the variable to prevent any issues with future Solidity versions or readability concerns. 2. Incorrect tuple assignment in \`g()\` function: The \`g()\` function attempts to destructure the return values of \`f()\` incorrectly because only two variables (\`uint256 x, uint256 y\`) are being used to capture the output, while the \`f()\` function returns three values. In Solidity, when you are destructuring tuple returns from a function call, you must account for all the returned values or explicitly skip them using empty slots. The corrected function \`g()\` needs to handle all three returned values like so: \`\`\`solidity function g() public { (uint256 x, , uint256 y) = f(); // Ignoring the middle boolean return value (x, y) = (y, x); // Swapping the values of x and y, only if required by the logic final = x; // Assuming rename of final to avoid future keyword conflicts } \`\`\` With this correction in place, the contract should compile successfully, assuming the variable \`final\` remains acceptable as a name. Otherwise, it's best to rename it: \`\`\`solidity // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.20; contract C { uint256 finalValue; // renamed the 'final' variable to 'finalValue' function f() public pure returns (uint256, bool, uint256) { return (7, true, 2); } function g() public { (uint256 x, , uint256 y) = f(); // Correctly handling return values (x, y) = (y, x); // Swapping logic if intended finalValue = x; // Storing the value in the state variable } } \`\`\` It's important to note that while the original code will fail to compile due to improper handling of returned values, your intention behind swapping values \`x\` and \`y\` should also be clear. If the intent is simply to store the first or last value returned by \`f()\` into the state variable \`finalValue\`, the swapping operation is unnecessary."},{"prompt":"What are arrow functions, please explain with the help of an example","completion":"Arrow functions are a feature introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) that provide a more concise syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript. They are often used in place of traditional function expressions, especially when working with functions that are passed as arguments, such as callbacks. Arrow functions have a shorter syntax compared to function expressions and do not have their own \`this\`, \`arguments\`, \`super\`, or \`new.target\` bindings. Instead, they inherit \`this\` from the parent scope at the time they are defined, which is a key feature that prevents common bugs especially when dealing with the \`this\` context in object methods and event handlers. Here's the basic syntax of an arrow function: \`\`\`javascript const functionName = (parameter1, parameter2, ..., parameterN) => { // function body return expression; } \`\`\` If the arrow function body consists of only a single statement that returns a value, you can omit the curly braces \`{}\` and the \`return\` keyword, making the syntax even more concise: \`\`\`javascript const functionName = (parameter1, parameter2, ..., parameterN) => expression; \`\`\` If there's only one parameter, you can also omit the parentheses around the parameter list: \`\`\`javascript const functionName = parameter => expression; \`\`\` Here's an example of an arrow function: \`\`\`javascript // Traditional function expression const add = function(x, y) { return x + y; }; // Arrow function with the same functionality const addArrow = (x, y) => x + y; console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8 console.log(addArrow(5, 3)); // Output: 8 \`\`\` In this example, \`add\` is a traditional function expression with two parameters \`x\` and \`y\`, while \`addArrow\` is an arrow function that performs the same operation. Since the arrow function's body contains only one expression, \`{}\` and \`return\` are omitted. Arrow functions are particularly useful as callback functions. For example, when using methods like \`map\`, \`filter\`, and \`reduce\` on arrays: \`\`\`javascript const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; const doubled = numbers.map(number => number * 2); console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] \`\`\` In this example, the arrow function \`number => number * 2\` is passed as an argument to the \`map\` method to double each element of the \`numbers\` array. The concise syntax of arrow functions makes the code easier to read and write when dealing with functional programming patterns in JavaScript."},{"prompt":"Ацетилхолин Где содержится","completion":"Ацетилхолин содержится в нервных окончаниях и является одним из основных нейромедиаторов в центральной и периферической нервной системе.

It's important to note that Java's standard library doesn't have built-in support for multi-threaded sorting in \`java.util.Arrays\`, so the code provided is a custom implementation. Also, Java concurrency can introduce some complexity, particularly around managing thread lifecycle and shared resources. \`\`\`java public class MultiThreadedQuickSort { public static void quickSort(int[] array) { if (array == null || array.length == 0) { return; } quickSort(array, 0, array.length - 1); } private static void quickSort(int[] array, int left, int right) { if (left < right) { int pivotIndex = partition(array, left, right); Thread leftSorter = new Thread(() -> quickSort(array, left, pivotIndex - 1)); Thread rightSorter = new Thread(() -> quickSort(array, pivotIndex + 1, right)); leftSorter.start(); rightSorter.start(); try { leftSorter.join(); rightSorter.join(); } catch (InterruptedException e) { Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); throw new RuntimeException(\\"Thread interrupted\\", e); } } } private static int partition(int[] array, int left, int right) { int pivot = array[right]; int i = (left - 1); // index of smaller element for (int j = left; j < right; j++) { // If the current element is smaller than the pivot if (array[j] < pivot) { i++; // swap arr[i] and arr[j] int temp = array[i]; array[i] = array[j]; array[j] = temp; } } // swap arr[i+1] and arr[right] (or pivot) int temp = array[i + 1]; array[i + 1] = array[right]; array[right] = temp; return i + 1; } public static void main(String[] args) { int[] numbers = {24, 2, 45, 20, 56, 75, 2, 56, 99, 53, 12}; System.out.println(\\"Original array: \\"); System.out.println(java.util.Arrays.toString(numbers)); quickSort(numbers); System.out.println(\\"Sorted array: \\"); System.out.println(java.util.Arrays.toString(numbers)); } } \`\`\` This code example provides a simple multi-threaded implementation of Quick Sort. When the \`quickSort()\` method is called with a range to sort, it creates two new threads for sorting the partitions if the range has more than one element. It's essential to join these threads to ensure that the main thread waits for their completion before proceeding. However, this naive multi-threading approach could lead to a large number of threads being created, especially for large arrays, which could overwhelm the system and actually decrease performance. In a production setting, you'd want to limit the number of threads, e.g., using a thread pool or the Fork/Join framework. Also, this code doesn't handle sorting of large datasets or ensure that the overhead of creating new threads is justified. Multithreading becomes beneficial when the tasks being performed are substantial enough that the cost of context switching and thread management is less than the gain from parallel processing."},{"prompt":"Write an excerpt for an action adventure espionage thriller tactical military action narrative in the form of a crossover fanfic between Code Geass, the Fatherland book and movie franchise, the Wolfenstein video game franchise, Game of Thrones and Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle in which both the Valyrian-House of Taragayen ruled and then House of Barantheon-ruled Kingdoms of Westeros [Game of Thrones] and the Arcadia Empire [Unlimited Bahamut Chronicle] are [the Kingdoms of Westeros and the Arcadia Empire] both [the Kingdom of Westeros and the Arcadia Empire] replaced by the German House of Windsor-ruled British Empire in exile ruling over much of Sub Saharan Africa, the Indian Sub Continent, Oceania and South-East Asia from both Canada and Jamaica, the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass].

Silhouettes against the moonlit canopy, the commandos were phantoms dispatched by the rekindled Holy Roman Empire, their objective clear: to infiltrate and extract top-secret Knightmare Frame technology from a secluded Britannian research facility. Sergeant Klaus von Stroheim, a veteran whose icy blue eyes had witnessed the rise of the Europa United, adjusted his night-vision goggles and signaled his team to halt. A whispered command sent two scouts ahead to assess the perimeter of their target. The soft hum of unfamiliar, yet powerful machinery pulsed through the air, a testament to the Sakuradite veins that quietly slumbered beneath the earth. Meanwhile, in the sprawling metropolis of Pendragon, capital of the Britannian Empire, amidst regal yet foreboding architecture that whispered of Valyrian elegance and Baratheon might, a clandestine group of Targaryen loyalists gathered. Huddled in the shadow of a once-glorious palace, they mourned for the loss of the dragons and the rise of steel behemoths that now dictated the course of war. Daena Targaryen, descendant of the exiled Valyrian bloodline, watched with a mixture of disgust and despair as her family's empire crumbled under the weight of Robert Baratheon's hedonistic tyranny. \\"Fire and blood... they were the words that united a kingdom,\\" she thought bitterly, her hand clenching around a hidden locket bearing her crest. \\"Now they are but echoes beneath the cacophony of this usurper's follies.\\" As the Waffen-SS commandos approached the facility, they caught a glimmer of the formidable Knightmare Frames through the foliage, otherworldly giants that seemed to mock the very gods of old. Stepping through the shadows, Klaus and his team avoided the patrolling automatons and silently disabled the security systems—a testament to their training and the supernatural enhancements granted to them by a mysterious force known only as Geass. They had prepared for this, leveraging every ounce of their psychic abilities to outmaneuver Britannia's technological fortress. Back in Pendragon, Daena's blue-violet eyes flared with a fire that belied her quiet demeanor. \\"Robert may have the throne, but he has not won the hearts of the people nor the loyalty of the dragons that still slumber within our blood,\\" she whispered to her confidants. They were plotting, planning for the day when Geass and Drag-Ride might once again serve under the banner of the true emperor—the blood of Old Valyria. What the Targaryen loyalists did not know was that back in the jungles, Klaus and his team were setting charges. Their mission was not just to steal, but to sabotage. With surgical precision, the commandos completed their objective, leaving behind a ticking clock that would soon erase the research that could have further tilted the balance of power in Britannia's favor. As the SS team retreated with stolen data and a captured Knightmare prototype into the darkest recesses of the tropical night, explosions erupted, lighting up the sky. The shockwaves rippled through the region, reaching the palace in Pendragon and jolting the plotters from their scheming. For a moment, all eyes turned skyward. Daena's heart thudded with a mix of terror and exhilaration. \\"The dragons wake,\\" she murmured, as a newfound resolve filled the room. It was a sign, she believed, that the old magic was not dead, and that the age of Britannia's unchecked domination might soon come to an end. It was a signal to all—kingdoms may rise and fall, tyrants may grasp at power, but the fire of rebellion burns eternal, fanned by the whispers of revolution and the dreams of the exiled emperors."},{"prompt":"I would like a list of 10 airports closest to Toruń, Poland, ordered by distance from the closest to the farthest.","completion":"1.

His appearance is striking – a tan trench coat belts at his waist over form-fitting layers that hint at an athletic build, nylon stockings and knee-length heeled boots that silently click on the hardwood floor. His hands, clad in snug leather gloves, brush the coat aside as he closes the door with a soft click. Kaito moves with purpose, his eyes scanning for the prize – his bully’s computer.

Tension undercuts the scene – the threat of the owner’s return hanging in the air like a barely audible whisper. Yet, in this stolen space and time, Kaito's demeanor suggests he's exactly where he needs to be. Suddenly, the USB stick's light blinks; the transfer is complete. Kaito closes the browser, ensuring no trace of his trespass remains. He removes the stick, pocketing it with an air of victory that contradicts the potential danger of his mission.

Create their script in FILIPINO Here is the chapter 1-4: I SA CUBIERTA Sic itur ad astra. Isáng umaga ng̃ Disiembre ay hiráp na sumasalung̃a sa palikólikông linalakaran ng̃ ilog Pasig ang bapor Tabò, na may lulang maraming tao, na tung̃o sa Lalaguna. Ang bapor ay may anyông bagól, halos bilóg na warì’y tabò na siyáng pinanggaling̃an ng̃ kaniyang pang̃alan; nápakarumí kahit na may nasà siyang magíng maputî, malumanay at warìng nagmamalakí dahil sa kaniyang banayad na lakad. Gayon man, siya’y kinagigiliwan sa dakong iyon, sanhî marahil sa pang̃alan niyang tagalog ó dahil sa tagláy niya ang sadyâng ugalì ng̃ mg̃a bagay-bagay ng̃ bayan, isáng warì’y tagumpáy na laban sa pagkakasulong, isáng bapor na hindî tunay na bapor ang kabuòan, isáng sangkáp na hindî nagbabago, hindî ayos ng̃unì’t hindî mapag-aalinlang̃anan, na, kung ibig mag-anyông makabago ay nasisiyahan na ng̃ boong kalakhán sa isáng pahid ng̃ pintura. Na ang bapor na itó’y tunay na pilipino! Kauntìng pagpapaumanhín lamang ang gamiti’t pagkakamanláng siya ang daóng ng̃ Pamahalàan, na nayarì sa ilalim ng̃ pagsisiyasat ng̃ mg̃a Reberendo at mg̃a Ilustrísimo! Balót ng̃ liwanag sa umaga, hayo na ang maputî niyang katawán (na iniwawasiwas ang maitim na usok) na nagpapagaláw sa alon ng̃ ilog at nagpapaawit sa hang̃in sa mg̃a maigkás na kawayang nasa sa magkábilang pangpáng; may nagsasabing nag-uumusok din ang daóng ng̃ Pamahalàan!... Sa bawà’t sandalî’y tumítilî ang pasuit na paós at mapagbalà na warì’y isáng manggagahís na ibig makapanaíg sa tulong ng̃ sigáw, kayâ’t sa loób ng̃ bapor ay hindî magkarinigan, ang lahát ng̃ mákatagpô’y pinagbabalàan; minsa’y warìng ibig durugin ang mg̃a salambáw, (mg̃a yayat na kagamitán sa pang̃ing̃isdâ) na ang galáw ay warìng kalansáy ng̃ gigante na yumúyukô sa isáng pagóng na nabuhay sa kapanahunang dako pa roon ng̃ pag-apaw ng̃ tubig sa boông [8]mundó; minsa’y tumátakbóng tung̃o sa mg̃a kakawayanán ó kayâ’y sa mg̃a karihan, na napapalamutihan ng̃ gumamela at ibá pang bulaklák, na warìng mg̃a magsisipaligòng nakalubóg na sa tubig ang mg̃a paa’y ayaw pang maglublób... minsa’y sa pagsunód sa daáng itinuturò ng̃ iláng kawayang nakatirik sa ilog ay lumalakad ng̃ boông kasiyahang loób ang bapor; ng̃unì’t ang isáng biglâng pagkakabagók ay kauntî nang ikinabuwal ng̃ mg̃a sakáy; nápadumog sa isáng burak na mababaw na hindî hinihinalà nino man...... At kung ang pagkakawangkî sa daóng ng̃ Pamahalàan ay hindî pa lubós, ay tingnan ang pagkakalagáy ng̃ mg̃a lulan. Sa ilalim ng̃ cubierta ay nang̃agdung̃aw ang mg̃a mukhâng kayumanggí at maiitim ng̃ mg̃a taga rito, mg̃a insík at mestiso na nagkakasiksikang kasama ng̃ mg̃a lulang kalakal at mg̃a kabán, samantalang sa itaás, sa ibabaw ng̃ cubierta at sa lilim ng̃ isáng panambil na nagtatanggol sa kanilá sa init ng̃ araw, ay nang̃akaupô sa maginhawang luklukan ang iláng sakáy na suot taga Europa, mg̃a prayle at mg̃a kawaní, na humihitít ng̃ malalakíng tabako, samantalàng tinátanáw ang mg̃a dinadaanan, na hindî man nápupuna ang mg̃a pagsusumakit ng̃ kapitán na maiwasan ang mg̃a balakid sa ilog. Ang kapitán ay isáng ginoo na may magiliw na anyô, lubhâ ng̃ matandâ, dating maglalayág na noong kabataàn niya ay namahalà sa lalòng matuling daóng at sa lalòng malawak na karagatan at ng̃ayóng tumandâ’y ginagamit ang lalòng malakíng pag-iisip, pagiing̃at at pagbabantáy upáng maiwasan ang maliliít na kapang̃aniban.... At yaón dín ang balakid sa araw araw, ang dati ring mabababaw na burak, ang dati ring lakí ng̃ bapor na násasadsád sa mg̃a likô ring yaon, na warì’y isáng matabâng babai sa gitnâ ng̃ siksikan ng̃ tao, kayâ’t ang mabaít na kapitán ay humihintô sa bawà’t sandalî, umuurong, pinagkakalahatì lamang ang tulin, pinagpapalipatlipat sa kaliwâ’t sa kanan ang limáng marinerong may hawak na tikin upáng ipanibulos ang likông itinuturò ng̃ timón. Warìng isáng matandâng kawal, na matapos mamunò sa mg̃a tao sa isáng maligalig na himagsikan, ay nagíng taga pag-alagà, ng̃ tumandâ, ng̃ batàng masumpung̃in, matigás ang ulo at tamád. At si aling Victorina na siyáng tang̃ìng babaing nakiupô sa lipon ng̃ mg̃a europeo ay siyáng makapagsasabi kung ang [9]bapor Tabò ay tamád, masuwayin at masumpung̃in; si aling Victorina, na gaya ng̃ karaniwan ay napakamasindakin, ay nagtutung̃ayaw sa mg̃a kaskó, bankâ, balsá ng̃ niyog, mg̃a indio na namamangkâ at sampûng mg̃a naglalabá at nagsisipaligò na kinayayamután niya dahil sa pagkakatuwâ at kaing̃ayan! Siya ng̃â namán, kung walâng mg̃a indio sa ilog at sa bayan ay bubuti ang lakad ng̃ Tabò, oo! kung walâng isá mang indio, sa mundó; hindî niya nápupunang ang mg̃a tumitimón ay pawàng indio, indio ang mg̃a marinero, indio ang mg̃a makinista, indio ang siyam na pù’t siyam sa bawà’t isáng daang sakáy at siyá man ay india rin kung kakayurin ang kaniyang pulbós at huhubarán siya ng̃ ipinagmamalakíng bata. Nang umagang iyón ay lalò pang namumuhî si aling Victorina dahil sa hindî siya pinapansín ng̃ mg̃a kalipon, at dapat ng̃â namáng magkagayón, sapagkâ’t tignán ng̃â namán ninyó: magkalipon doon ang tatlông prayleng nananalig na ang boông mundó’y lalakad ng̃ patiwarík sa araw na silá’y lumakad ng̃ matuwíd; isáng walâng pagál na D. Custodio na payapàng natutulog, na siyangsiya ang loób sa kaniyang mg̃a munakalà; isáng walâng pagod na mánunulat na gaya ni Ben-Zayb (katimbang ng̃ Ibañez) na nag-aakalàng kung kayâ’t may nag-íisíp sa Maynilà ay sa dahilang siya’y nag-íisíp; isáng canónigo na gaya ni P. Irene na nagbibigay dang̃al sa mg̃a parì dahil sa mabuti ang pagkakaahit ng̃ kaniyang mukhâng kinatatayuan ng̃ isáng ilóng hudío at dahil sa kaniyang sotanang sutlâ na mainam ang tabas at maraming botones; at isáng mayamang mag-aalahás na gaya ni Simoun na siya mandíng tanung̃an at nag-uudyok sa mg̃a galáw ng̃ Capitán General; akalaìn ng̃â ba namáng magkátatagpô ang mg̃a haliging itó na sine quibus non ng̃ bayan, magkápipisan doon at maligayang nag-uusap, na hindî nabibighanìng malugód sa isáng tumakwil sa pagkapilipina, na nagpapulá ng̃ buhók, ¡bagay ng̃ sukat makabugnot sa isáng Joba!, pang̃alang ikinakapit sa sarili ni aling Victorina kailan ma’t may katung̃o. At ang pagkayamót ng̃ babai’y nararagdagan sa bawà’t pagsigáw ng̃ Kapitán ng̃: baborp! estriborp!, bubunutin ng̃ mg̃a marino ang kaniláng mahahabàng tikín at isasaksák sa isá’t isáng gilid at pinipigil sa tulong ng̃ kaniláng mg̃a hità’t balikat na másadsád sa dakong iyon ang bapor. Kung susukatin [10]sa gayóng anyô ang daóng ng̃ Pamahalàan ay masasabing nawawalâ ang pagkapagóng at nagiging alimang̃o sa tuwîng málalapít ang isáng pang̃anib. —Ng̃unì’t kapitán, ¿bakit tumutung̃o sa dakong iyan ang inyóng mg̃a mangmang na timonel?—ang tanóng na pagalít ng̃ babai. —Sapagkâ’t doon ay napakababaw, ali—ang sagót na malumanay ng̃ Kapitán at ikinindát ang matá. Naugalì na ang ganitó ng̃ Kapitán upáng sabihin warì sa kaniyáng mg̃a salitâ, na dahandahang lumabás: marahan, marahang marahan! —Kalahatìng tulin ng̃ mákina, bá, kalahatìng tulin!—ang paalipustâng tutol ni aling Victorina—¿bakit hindî boông tulin? —Sapagkâ’t maglalayág tayo sa mg̃a palayang iyan, ali,—ang walâng katinagtinag na sagót ng̃ Kapitán na sabay ang paglabì upang iturò ang bukid; makálawang kumindát. Ang aling Victorinang itó ay kilalá dahil sa kaniyang mg̃a kasagwâan at mg̃a himaling. Dumádalóng palagì sa mg̃a lipunán at siya’y tinitiis doon kailan ma’t kasama ang kaniyáng pamangkín, si Paulita Gomez, magandá at mayamang binibini, ulila sa amá’t iná, na kinúkupkóp ni aling Victorina. Nang tumandâ na ang aling Victorinang itó ay nag-asawa sa isáng kulang-palad na ang pang̃alan ay D. Tiburcio de Espadaña, at sa mg̃a sandalîng itó na nakikita natin siya ay may labíng limáng taón nang kasál, ang buhók ay postiso at ang kalahatì ng̃ kagayakan ay ayos taga Europa. Sa dahiláng ang kaniyáng boông hang̃ád sapol ng̃ magkaasawa ay ang mag-anyông europea, sa tulong ng̃ iláng mahalay na kaparaanan, ay nahulog díng untî-untî ang kaniyáng ayos sa isáng anyông, sa kasalukuyan, kahi’t na magtulong si Quatrefages at si Virchow ay hindî máwawatasan kung sa alíng lahìng mg̃a kilala siya máihahalò. Makaraan ang iláng taóng pagkákasál, ang kaniyáng asawang nagtiís, na warì’y fakir na umalinsunod sa lahát ng̃ kaniyáng maibigan, ay dinalaw ng̃ isáng masamâng sandalî, isáng araw, at hinambalos siyá ng̃ tinútungkód sa pagkapilay. Dahil sa pagkakabiglâ ni aling Joba, sa gayóng pagbabagong ugalì, ay hindî naalumana ang magiging kasunód ng̃ pangyayari, at ng̃ makaraan ang pagkakagitlá at [11]ng̃ ang kaniyáng asawa ay makatanan, ay sakâ pa lamang náramdamán ang sakít at náhigâng iláng araw, sa gitnâ ng̃ pagkagalák ni Paulita na mahilig sa pagtatawá at pagbibirô sa kaniyáng ali. Ng̃unì’t ang asawa, sindák sa nágawâng kasalanan, na sa kaniya’y warìng isáng kakilakilabot na pagpatay sa kabiyák ng̃ pusò ang gayóng nágawâ, habol ng̃ mg̃a furia sa tahanan (ang dalawáng aso at isáng loro sa bahay), ay nagtatakbó ng̃ boông tuling ipinahintulot ng̃ kaniyáng pílay, lumulan sa unang sasakyáng nátagpûán, sumakáy sa unang bangkâng nákita sa isáng ilog, at, Ulises na pilipino, nagpagalàgalà sa mg̃a bayán-bayán, sa isá’t isáng lalawigan, sa isá’t isáng pulô, na pinamumuntután ng̃ kaniyáng Calipso, na naka quevedo, na nakayáyamot sa bawà’t mákasama sa paglalakbáy. Tumanggáp ng̃ balità na ang lalaki’y nagtatagò sa isáng bayan ng̃ Laguna, kayâ’t yáon na siya upáng akitin sa tulong ng̃ kaniyáng buhók na tininà. Ang mg̃a kasabáy ay nagkáisáng magsanggaláng sa kaniyáng pakikitung̃o sa pamagitan ng̃ isáng walâng hintông pagsasalitâang ang balàng bagay ay pinagtalunan. Sa mg̃a sandalîng iyón, dahil sa palikôlikô ng̃ ilog, ay pinag-uusapan ang pagtutuwíd sa kaniya at ang ukol sa mg̃a gawâin ng̃ Obras del Puerto. Si Ben-Zayb, ang mánunulat na mukhâng prayle, ay nakikipagtalo sa isáng parìng batà na mukhâ namáng artillero. Kapwâ nagsisigawang ang anyô ng̃ mukhâ ay iniaayos sa sinasabi, itinátaás ang mg̃a bisig, inilalahad ang mg̃a kamáy, nagsisitadyák, nag-uusap ng̃ ukol sa patitís, mg̃a palaisdàan, ilog San Mateo, mg̃a indio at ibp. sa gitnâ ng̃ kasiyahang loob ng̃ mg̃a nakikiníg at sa gitnâ rin namán ng̃ boông pagkainíp ng̃ isáng matandâng parìng pransiskano, na lubhâng nápakapayát at nang̃ang̃alirang, at ng̃ isáng dominiko na magandá ang tindíg na nagbábakás.... nagbábakás sa kaniyáng mg̃a labì ng̃ isáng ng̃itîng pakutyâ. Ang payát na pransiskano, na nakápuná sa ng̃itî ng̃ dominiko, ay nagnasàng makilahók sa usapan, upáng maputol. Iginagalang siya marahil, kayâ’t sa isáng kilos lamang ng̃ kamáy ay napigil ang pag-uusap ng̃ dalawá, nang ang parìng-artillero ay tumukoy ng̃ ukol sa kinátutuhan at ang mánunulat na prayle ay ng̃ ukol namán sa karunung̃an. [12]—¿Alám bagá ninyó kung anó ang mg̃a taong marurunong, Ben-Zayb?—anáng pransiskano na ang boses ay malalim, na hindî man lamang halos gumaláw sa kaniyáng uupan, at ang mg̃a nang̃ang̃alirang na kamáy ay bahagyâ nang ikilos—Nariyan sa lalawigan ang Puente del Capricho, na gawâ ng̃ isáng kapatíd namin, at hindî nayarì, sapagkâ’t pinintasáng mahinà at mapang̃anib ng̃ mg̃a marurunong, sa panunuláy sa kaniláng mg̃a sapantahà, ng̃unì’t tignán ninyó’t nariyan ang tuláy na naglálabán sa lahát ng̃ bahâ at lindol. —Iyan, puñales, iyang talagá, iyan ng̃â sana ang sasabihin ko!—ang wikà ng̃ parìng artillero na kasabáy ang suntók sa gabáy ng̃ kaniyáng luklukang kawayan;—iyan, ang Puente del Capricho at ang mg̃a marurunong; iyan sana ang sasabihin ko, P. Salvi, puñales. Nápahintông nakang̃itî si Ben-Zayb, marahil sa paggalang ó kayâ’y dahil sa sadyâng walâng maalamang isagot; kahit gayong ¡siya ang tang̃ìng nag-íisíp dito sa Pilipinas!—Si P. Irene ay sumasang-ayon sa tulong ng̃ ulo, samantalang pinapahidpahiran ang kaniyáng mahabàng ilóng. Si P. Salvi, iyóng parìng payát at nang̃ang̃alirang, ay nagpatuloy, na warìng nasiyahan sa gayóng pang̃ang̃ayupapà, sa gitnâ ng̃ katahimikan: —Datapwâ’y hindî ibig sabihin ng̃ ganitó na kayó’y walâ sa katwiran at gayón dín namán si P. Camorra (itó ang pang̃alan ng̃ parìng artillero); ang kasamaán ay nasa lawà..... —Sadyâ namáng walâng mabuting lawà sa lupaíng itó—ang patláng ni aling Victorina, na muhîng muhî na at humandâ upáng lusubing mulî ang kutà. Ang mg̃a binabakod ay sindák na nagting̃inan, ng̃unì’t, gaya ng̃ katalasan ng̃ isáng general, dumulóg ang mag-aalahás na si Simoun: —Ang kagamutan ay nápakadalî,—anyá na ang pagbigkás ng̃ salitâ ay katang̃itang̃ì, kalahatìng inglés at kalahatìng amerikano sa Timog—at hindî ko ng̃â maalaman kung bakit hindî pa náiisip ng̃ kahit sino. Ang lahát ay luming̃ón, sampû ng̃ dominiko, at pinakinggán siyang mabuti. Ang mag-aalahás ay isáng taong yayát, mataas, malitid, nápakakayumanggí, suot inglés at ang ginagamit ay warìng salakót na timsim. Katang̃ìtang̃ì sa kaniya ang mahabàng buhók na putîng putî na nátitiwalî sa misáy na [13]itím, madalang, na nagpapakilala ng̃ kaniyáng pagkamestiso. Upang iwasan ang sinag ng̃ araw ay palagìng gumagamit ng̃ salamíng asul na de rejillas, na tumátakíp sa kaniyáng mg̃a matá at bahagi ng̃ mg̃a pisng̃í, na siyáng nagbibigáy sa kaniya ng̃ anyông bulág ó may sakít sa matá. Nakatayông ang paa’y nakabikakâ upáng makapanimbang warî, ang mg̃a kamáy ay nakapasok sa mg̃a alapót ng̃ kaniyáng chaqueta. —Ang kagamutan ay lubhâng madalî—ang ulit—at walâng magugugol. Ang pakiking̃íg na mabuti ay nag-ibayo. Násasabísabí sa mg̃a lipunán sa Maynilà na ang táong iyon ay siyang sinusunód ng̃ General, kayâ’t nákikinikinitá na ng̃ lahát na ang kagamutan ay magagawâ. Pati si D. Custodio ay nápaling̃ón. —Magbukás ng̃ isáng ludlód na tuwid, mulâ sa pagpasok ng̃ ilog hangáng sa paglabás, na dádaan sa Maynilà, itó ng̃â, gumawâ ng̃ isáng bagong ilog na ludlód at tabunan ang dating ilog Pasig. Hindî mag-aaksayá ng̃ lupà at iiklî ang paglalakbáy, mapipigil ang pagkakaroon ng̃ dakong mababaw. Ang panukalàng itó’y nakalitó sa lahát halos, na nahirati sa mg̃a paraáng tapaltapal. —Isáng munakalàng yankee—ani Ben-Zayb, na ibig kalugdán ni Simoun—Ang mag-aalahás ay malaong naninirahan sa Amerika, sa Hilagà. Inarì ng̃ lahát na malakí ang palagáy at ang gayón ay ipinakilala sa mg̃a galáw ng̃ ulo. Tang̃ì si D. Custodio, ang may magandáng loob na si D. Custodio, na dahil sa kaniyáng malayàng kalagayan at matataás na katungkulang gináganáp, ay nag-akalàng nárarapat na bakahin niya ang isáng panukalà na hindî sa kaniya buhat—¡iyon ay isáng pang̃ung̃unang baít!—umubó, hinaplós ang kaniyáng misáy at sa tulong ng̃ kaniyáng matigás na boses at warìng nasa sa isáng sadyâng pagpupulong ng̃ Ayuntamiento, ay nagwikàng: —Patawarin akó ni G. Simoun, na aking kagalanggalang na kaibigan, kung sabihin kong hindî niya akó kasang-ayon; maraming salapî ang magugugol at marahil ay sisirà tayo ng̃ mg̃a bayanan. —Sumirà!—ang mahinahong sagót ng̃ mag-aalahás. —¿At ang salapîng ibabayad sa mg̃a manggagawà?...... —Huwag bayaran. Sa mg̃a bilanggô at presidiario...... [14]—Hindî makasásapát, ginoong Simoun! —Kung hindî sásapát, ang lahát ng̃ bayan, ang mg̃a matatandâ, ang mg̃a binatà, ang mg̃a batà, ay gumawâ, at palitán ang labing limáng araw na sápilitáng paggawâ, ng̃ tatlo, apat ó limang buwang paggawâ na ukol sa Pamahalàan, na may katungkulan pang ang bawà’t isá ay magdalá ng̃ kaniyáng pagkain at kasangkapan. Si D. Custodio ay sindák na luming̃ón upang tanawín kung sa kalapít ay may isáng indio na nakakáding̃íg sa kanilá. Salamat na lamang at ang nang̃aroroon ay pawàng taga bukid, at ang dalawáng timonel ay warìng walâng pinápansín kun dî ang mg̃a likô ng̃ ilog. —Ng̃unì’t, ginoong Simoun..... —Manalig kayó, D. Custodio—ang matigás na patuloy ni Simoun—sa ganiyáng paraan lamang nayayarì ang malalakíng gawâin, sa muntîng gugol. Sa ganiyang paraan nayarì ang mg̃a Pirámide, ang lawàng Mœris at ang Coliseo sa Roma. Boôboông lalawigan ay nanggagaling sa mg̃a kaparang̃an na daládalá ang kaniláng mg̃a sibuyas upáng may mákain; ang mg̃a matatandâ, mg̃a binatà at mg̃a batà ay nang̃aghahakót ng̃ bató, tinatapyás nilá at pinápasán sa pamamahalà ng̃ pamalò ng̃ nakapangyayari; at pagkatapos ay bumabalík sa kaníkaniláng bayan ang nang̃álabí, ó nang̃amamatáy sa buhang̃inan ng̃ kalawakan. Makaraán yaón ay dumádatíng ang ibáng lalawigan, pagkatapos ay ibá namán, sunód sunód sa paggawâ sa loob ng̃ mg̃a taón; ang gawâin ay natatapos at ng̃ayó’y hináhang̃àan natin, naglalakbáy tayo, napaparoon tayo sa Egipto ó sa Roma, pinupuri natin ang mg̃a Faraon, ang mg̃a mag-aanak na Antonina...... Maniwalà kayó D. Custodio; ang mg̃a patáy ay naiiwang patáy at ang malakás lamang ang binibigyán ng̃ katwiran ng̃ mg̃a kapanahunang súsunód. —Ng̃unì’t ang mg̃a ganiyang kaparaanan, ginoong Simoun, ay mangyayáring magíng sanhî ng̃ kaguluhan—ang sabi ni D. Custodio na hindî mápalagay dahil sa masamâng tung̃o ng̃ salitâan. —Kaguluhan; ha, ha! ¿Naghimagsík bagá ang bayang ehipsio minsan man, naghimagsik ang mg̃a piít na hudio ng̃ laban sa maawâíng si Tito? ¡Hindî ko akalàing mahinà palá kayó sa mg̃a bagay na násasabi sa kasaysayan! [15]Napagkíkilala na ang Simoung yaón ay napakamapagmalakí ó walâng pinagaralan. ¡Ipamukhâ kay D. Custodio na hindî nakababatíd ng̃ kasaysayan, ay isáng bagay na makagagalit sa káhit kanino! At gayón ng̃â ang nangyari, nakalimot si D. Custodio sa dating hilig at sumagót ng̃: —Ang bagay, ay sa dahiláng hindî ehipsio ni hudio ang inyóng mg̃a kakaharapín! —At ang bayang itó’y hindî miminsang naghimagsík na—ang dugtóng na may muntîng takot ng̃ dominiko—noong kapanahunang pinahihila ng̃ malalakíng kahoy upáng gawíng mg̃a daóng, kung hindî dahil sa mg̃a parì...... —Ang kapanahunang iyón ay malayò na;—ang sagót ni Simoun na ang tawa’y lalò pa mandíng matigás kay sa karaniwan—ang mg̃a pulông itó’y hindî mulîng maghihimagsík ng̃ dahil sa mg̃a gawâin at buwis...... ¿Hindî bagá pinupuri ninyó P. Salvi—ang dugtóng, na, ang hinaráp ay ang payát na pransiskano—ang bahay at pagamutan sa Los Baños na kinaroroonan ng̃ General? Iginaláw ni P. Salvi ang ulo at tuming̃íng may pagkakamanghâ sa tanóng. —¿Hindî bagá sinabi ninyó sa aking ang dalawáng bahay na iyon ay naitayô sa tulong ng̃ pagpilit sa mg̃a bayan na gumawâ doon, sa ilalim ng̃ kapangyarihan ng̃ isáng uldóg? Marahil, ang Puente del Capricho, ay nayarì din sa gayóng kaparaanan. At sabihin ninyó ¿naghimagsík bagá ang mg̃a bayang itó? —Ng̃unì’t.... naghimagsík na noong araw—ang sabi ng̃ dominiko—at ab actu ad posse valet illatio. —Walâ, walâ, walâ!—ang patuloy ni Simoun na humandâng dumaán sa escotilla upáng pumanaog sa kámara—ang nasabi ay nasabi na. At kayó P. Sibyla ay huwag bumanggit ng̃ mg̃a wikàng latín at ng̃ mg̃a katunggakán. ¿Sa anó’t náririto kayóng mg̃a prayle kung maaarìng maghimagsík ang mg̃a bayan? Si Simoun ay pumanaog sa muntîng hagdanan, na hindî pinansín ang mg̃a tutol at sagót, at inuulit ulit ang salitâng: Vaya, vaya! Si P. Sibyla ay namutlâ; noon lamang siya, Vice-Rector sa Universidad, napagsabihang may katunggakán; si D. Custodio ay kulay berde; sa alín mang pulong na kanyáng kinároonan [16]ay hindî nakatagpô ng̃ isáng katunggalîng kagaya niyon. Ang gayón ay nápakalabis. —Isáng mulato amerikano!—ang pabulalás na ung̃ol. —Indio-inglés!—ang marahang sabi ni Ben-Zayb. —Sinasabi ko sa inyóng amerikano, ¿hindî ko malalaman?—ang tugóng nayayamót ni D. Custodio—sinabi sa akin ng̃ General; iyá’y isáng mag-aalahás na nákilala niya sa Habana at ayon sa hinalà ko’y siyang nagbigáy sa kaniya ng̃ katungkulan, sapagkâ’t pinautang siya ng̃ salapî. Kayâ ng̃â, upang mabayaran, ay pinaparito at ng̃ gawín ang balà na, dagdagán ang kaniyáng kayamanan sa pagbibilí ng̃ mg̃a brillanteng.... hindî totoo, ¡anó ang malay natin! At napakawalâng ling̃ap, na, matapos kunan ng̃ salapî ang mg̃a indio ay ibíg pang..! ¡Pf! At tinapos ang salitâ sa isáng makahulugáng kilos ng̃ kamáy. Walâng makapang̃ahás na makisali sa gayóng mg̃a pag-alimura; si D. Custodio ay mangyayaring makipagsirâ sa Capitán General kung ibig niya, ng̃unì’t ni si Ben-Zayb, ni si P. Irene, ni si P. Salvi, ni ang hinalay na si P. Sibyla ay walâng katiwalà sa paglilihim ng̃ ibá. —Ang taong iyan, sapagkâ’t amerikano, ay nag-aakalàng ang kákaharapín natin ay ang mg̃a “pieles rojas”.... ¡Magsalitâ ng̃ mg̃a bagay na iyan sa loób ng̃ isáng bapor! Ipag-utos, pilitin ang tao!.... At iyan ang nag-udyók ng̃ pagsalakay sa Carolinas, ng̃ pagdigmâ sa Mindanaw na pupulubi ng̃ kalaitlait sa atin.... At siya ang humandóg na mamagitná sa paggawâ ng̃ “crucero”, ng̃unì’t ang tanóng ko namán: ¿anó ang muwang ng̃ isáng mag-aalahás, kahit na napakayaman at napakabihasa, sa pagpapagawâ ng̃ mg̃a daóng? Ang lahát ng̃ itó’y sinasabing pinalalaki ang boses ni D. Custodio, kay Ben-Zayb, na sabáy ang kumpáy, higít ng̃ balikat, maminsanminsang tumátanóng sa ting̃ín sa ibáng iginagaláw namán ang ulo nang walâng ibig turan. Ang kanónigóng si P. Irene ay napapang̃itîng walâng ibig sabihin, na tinátakpán ng̃ kamáy sa tulong ng̃ paghaplós sa kaniyáng ilóng. —Sinasabi ko sa inyó, Ben-Zayb—ang patuloy ni D. Custodio na ináalóg ang bisig ng̃ mánunulat—ang lahát ng̃ kasamâáng nangyayari ay sanhî ng̃ hindî pagtatatanóng sa mg̃a taong may malaong paninirahan dito. Isáng panukalàng may malalakíng salitâ at malakíng gugol, isáng gugulíng [17]malakíng halagá ay nakabubulag at tinátanggáp agád.... dahil dito! Pinagkiskis ni D. Custodio ang kaniyáng mg̃a dalirìng hinglalakí, hintuturò at panggitnâ. —Mayroon ng̃âng kauntì niyan, kauntì niyan—ang akalà ni Ben-Zayb na dapat niyang isagót, dahil sa kaniyáng pagkamamamahayag ay dapat makaalám ng̃ lahát. —Tignán ninyó, una diyan sa mg̃a gawâin ng̃ Obras del Puerto, ay nagharáp akó ng̃ isáng munakalà, bago, malinaw, mapakikinabang̃an, muntîng gugol at magagawâ upang luminis ang wawà ng̃ dagat na tabáng, at hindî tinanggáp dahil sa hindî nagbíbigáy ng̃ ganitó! At inulit ang kiskís ng̃ mg̃a dalirì, kinibít ang balikat at ang lahát ay tinignán na warìng ang ibig sabihin ay: ¿Nakakita na kayó ng̃ ganiyang kasawián? —At ¿maarì bagáng mabatíd ang palagáy?—At..—Abá!—ang pamanghâ ng̃ isá’t isá na nang̃aglapitan at nagkagipitan sa pakiking̃íg. Ang mg̃a munakalà ni D. Custodio ay pawàng bantóg na kagaya ng̃ mg̃a yarìng lunas ng̃ mg̃a manggagamot. Kauntî ng̃ hindî sabihin ni D. Custodio ang bagay, sapagkâ’t nagdamdám dahil sa hindî siyá sinang-ayunan noong dinudustâ si Simoun. “Pag walâng pang̃anib ay ibig ninyóng akó’y magsalitâ, ha? at pag mayroon ay walâ kayóng imík”, ang sasabihin sana; ng̃unì’t ang gayón ay isáng pagpapakawalâ ng̃ isáng mabuting pagkakataón at yayamang hindî na maisasagawâ ang panukalà ay mákilala man lamang at hang̃àan. Matapos ang dalawá ó tatlóng bugá ng̃ asó, umubó at lumurâ ng̃ patagilíd, ay tinanóng si Ben-Zayb, na sabáy ang tampál sa hità nitó. —¿Nakakita na ba kayó ng̃ pato? —Tila... nakáhuli kamí sa lawà—ang tugóng pahang̃â ni Ben-Zayb. —Hindî, hindî ko tinutukoy ang patong bukid, ang tinutukoy ko’y ang mg̃a maamô na ináalagàan sa Pateros at sa Pasig. At ¿alám ninyó kung anó ang kaniláng kinakain? Si Ben-Zayb, ang tang̃ìng ulong nag-iisíp, ay hindî nakaáalám niyon; hindî niya napanghihimasukan ang hanap-buhay na iyon. —Mg̃a susông maliliít, tao kayo, mg̃a susông maliliít!—ang sagót ni P. Camorra—hindî kailang̃ang magíng indio [18]upáng makabatíd ng̃ bagay na iyan, sukat na ang magkaroon ng̃ paning̃ín! —Iyán ng̃â, mg̃a susông maliliít!—ang ulit ni D. Custodio na iginágaláw ang hintuturò—at alám ninyó kung saan kinukuha? Hindî rin batíd ng̃ ulong mapag-isíp. —Kung kayó’y nanirahan na sa lupaíng itó ng̃ kágaya ng̃ habà ng̃ aking paninirahan, ay mababatíd ninyóng nakukuha sa wawà at doon ay marami na kahalò ng̃ buhang̃in. —¿At ang inyóng munakalà? —Iyán ng̃â ang tung̃o ko. Pipilitin ko ang lahát ng̃ bayang kalapít ng̃ wawà na mag-alagà ng̃ pato, at mákikita ninyó na silá, sa kaniláng sarili, ay palalalimin nilá ang wawà sa panghuhuli ng̃ susô... Ganiyáng ganiyán. Binuksán ni D. Custodio ang kaniyáng dalawáng bisig at malugód na tinanáwtanáw ang pagkakagulilát ng̃ mg̃a nakiking̃íg sa kaniyá; walâng isá mang nakáisip ng̃ gayóng kainam na panukalà. —¿Pinahihintulutan bagá ninyóng makasulat akó ng̃ isáng artículo ukol sa bagay na iyan?—ang tanóng ni Ben-Zayb—nápakakauntî ang nag-iisíp sa lupaíng itó.... —Ng̃unì’t D. Custodio,—ani aling Victorina na nagpakendengkendeng at kumilingkiling—kung ang lahát ay mag-áalagà ng̃ pato ay dadami ang itlóg na balót. ¡Uy nakapangdidiri! ¡Matabunan na muna ang wawà! II SA SILONG NG̃ CUBIERTA Sa silong ay ibá namán ang nangyayari. Nang̃akaupô sa bangkô at sa maliliít na luklukang kahoy, kasalamuhà ng̃ mg̃a maleta, bakol at tampipì, sa kalapít ng̃ mákina, init ng̃ kaldera, sing̃áw ng̃ katawáng tao at mabahòng amóy ng̃ lang̃ís, ay naroon ang lalòng makapál na taong sakáy. Tinátanáw na matahimik ng̃ ilán ang sarìsarìng anyô ng̃ mg̃a pangpang̃in sa gitnâ ng̃ dagundóng ng̃ mg̃a pala, ing̃ay ng̃ mákina, sagitsít ng̃ nakatatanang sing̃áw, buluwák ng̃ tubig na nahahalò, pasuwít ng̃ pakakak. Sa isáng súlok, nagkakapipisang warì’y bangkáy, ay natutulog ó nagtátangkâng [19]matulog ang iláng insík na mámimili, mg̃a liyó, nang̃amumutlâ, sumasago ang laway sa mg̃a nakang̃ang̃áng bibíg, at naliligò sa malagkít na pawis ng̃ kaniláng katawán. Ang iláng binatà lamang, na ang karamihan ay nang̃ag-aaral, madalîng makilala dahil sa kaniláng kagayakang lubhâng maputî at sa maayos na kiyas, ang nang̃ang̃ahás magyao’t dito sa popa at proa, na palundáglundág sa mg̃a bakol at kaha, masasayá dahil sa nálalapit na pagpapahing̃á sa pag-aaral. Mayâmayâ’y pinagtatalunan ang mg̃a galáw ng̃ mákina, na inaalaala ang napag-aralan, at mayâmayâ’y nang̃agpapaligidligid sa mg̃a binibining kolehiala, sa maghihitsóng may mapupuláng labì at may kuwintás na sampaga, at inaapung̃utan ang mg̃a dalaga ng̃ mg̃a salitâng nagpapatawa ó ikipinagtátakíp sa mukhâ ng̃ mg̃a pamaypáy na may pintá. Ng̃unì’t ang dalawá ay hindî nakikihimasok sa mg̃a maglalakbáy na babai kundî nakikipagtálo, sa may dakong proa, sa isáng matandâ na may makiyas at matuwid na tindíg. Siláng dalawá’y kapuwâ kilalá at iginagalang mandín alinsunod sa ting̃íng ipinatátanaw sa kanilá ng̃ ibá. Ang pinakamatandâ ng̃â sa dalawá, na pulós na itím ang kagayakan, ay si Basilio na nag-aaral sa Medisina, kilala dahil sa kaniyáng mabubuting panggagamót at mg̃a kahang̃àhang̃àng pang̃ang̃alagà sa mg̃a may sakít. Ang isá, ang malakí at malusog ang katawán, kahit batà kay sa una, ay si Isagani na isá sa mg̃a makatà ó kun di man makatà ay mánunulâng lumabás ng̃ taóng iyon sa Ateneo, may tang̃ìng kaugalìan, parating walâng kibô at lubhâng malungkutin. Ang matandâng katung̃o nilá ay si kapitáng Basilio na namilí sa Maynilà. —Opò, mabutíbutí na si kapitang Tiago,—ang sabi ng̃ nag-aaral na iginágaláw ang ulo—ayaw pumayag sa anománg pang̃ang̃alagà...... Sa udyók ng̃ ilán ay pinatung̃o akó sa S. Diego, sa kadahilanang dalawin ko ang bahay doon, ng̃unì’t ang tunay na sanhî ay upáng makahitít lamang siya ng̃ apian. Sa pagsasabi ng̃ nag-aaral ng̃ salitàng ilán ay si P. Irene ang tinutukoy, matalik na kaibigan at tanung̃an ni kapitáng Tiago sa mg̃a hulíng araw ng̃ kabuhayan nitó. —Ang apian ay isá sa mg̃a salot ng̃ kapanahunang itó—ang sabing paalipustâ’t pagalít ni kapitán, na warì’y senador romano—nákilala rin ng̃ mg̃a tao sa una ang apìan, [20]ng̃unì’t hindî nang̃agpakalabis. Samantalàng nanagumpáy ang pagkakahilig sa pag-aaral sa mg̃a clásico (liwanagin ninyong mabuti, mg̃a binatà), ang apian ay nagíng gamót lamang, at kung hindî, ay, sabihin ninyó sa akin kung sino ang nang̃agsisihitít. Ang mg̃a insík, ang mg̃a insík na hindî nakaáalám ng̃ isá mang salitâng latín! Ah, kung pinag-aralan lamang ni kapitán Tiago si Ciceron!...... At ang dî kasiyahang loob na lalong clásico ay nábakas sa mukhâ niyang epicúreo na ahít na ahít. Pinagmamasdán siyang mabuti ni Isagani: ang matandâng iyon ay nagdaramdám ng̃ kauhawan sa matatandâng bagay. —Ng̃unì’t balikán natin ang tungkól sa Akademia ng̃ wikàng kastilà—ang patuloy ni kapitang Basilio—pinatutunayan ko sa inyóng hindî ninyó magagawâ...... —Magagawâ pô, inaantáy na lamang namin ng̃ayón ó bukas ang pahintulot—ang sagót ni Isagani—si P. Irene, na marahil ay nákita ninyó sa itaas, na hinandugán namin ng̃ dalawáng kabayong castaño, ay nang̃akò na sa amin. Kayâ’t makikipag-usap sa General. —Walâng kabuluhán iyon; laban si P. Sibyla. —Lumaban man siya! Kayâ ng̃â’t kasama upáng...... sa Los Baños, sa haráp ng̃ General. At sa pagsasabi ng̃ ganitó’y pinagbubunggông pasuntók ng̃ nag-aaral na si Basilio ang kaniyáng dalawáng kamáy. —¡Batíd ko na!—ang tugóng tumatawa ni kapitáng Basilio.—Ng̃unì’t kahi’t ninyó mákuha ang pahintulot, ¿saan kukuha ng̃ salapî?...... —Mayroon na pô kamí; ang bawà’t nag-aaral ay aambág ng̃ sikapat. —¿Ng̃unì’t ang mg̃a magtuturò? —Mayroon kamí; ang kalahatì’y pilipino at ang kalahatì’y kastilà. —¿At ang bahay? —Si Makaraíg, idudulot ng̃ mayamang si Makaraíg ang isá niyang bahay. Napahinuhod si kapitáng Basilio; náihandâ ng̃ mg̃a binatàng iyón ang lahát ng̃ kailang̃an. —Kun sa bagay,—anyáng kinibít ang balikat,—ay hindî lubhâng masamâ ang panukalà, at yamang hindî na mangyayaring mapag-aralan ang latín, ay mapag-aralan man lamang [21]ang wikàng kastilà. Diyan ninyó mákikita tukayo, ang katunayan ng̃ paurong na lakad natín. Noong aming kapanahunan ay nag-aaral kamí ng̃ latín, sapagkâ’t ang lahát ng̃ aming mg̃a aklát ay nasa wikàng latín; ng̃ayón ay kauntìng latín na lamang ang inyóng pinag-aaralan, ng̃unì’t walâ kayóng mg̃a aklát sa wikàng latín; sa isáng dáko namán, ang mg̃a aklát ninyó’y nasa wikàng kastilà at hindí itinuturò ang wikàng itó: ætas parentum pejor avis tulit nos nequiores! gáya ng̃ sábi ni Horacio. At másabi itó’y lumayông nagmámalakí na warìng isáng emperador romano. —Iyáng mg̃a tao sa una,—ani Isagani,—ay may puná sa lahát; ipalalagáy mo sa kanilá ang isáng bagay at walâng mákikitang kabutihan kun dî pawàng salabíd. Ibig niláng dumatíng na lahát ng̃ palás at bilóg na warì’y bola ng̃ bilyar. —Ang amaín mo ang kasundông-kasundô niyá—ang wikà ni Basilio;—paguusapan iyóng kaniláng kapanahunan.... Hintáy ka ng̃â palá, ¿anó ang sabí-sabí ng̃ amaín mo kay Paulita? Si Isagani ay namulá. —Sinermonan akó ng̃ ukol sa pag-aasawa.... Sinagót ko siyáng sa Maynilà ay walâng kaparís niyá, magandá, may pinag-aralan, ulila...... —Mayamang-mayaman, makisig, masayá at walâng kasiràan kung dî ang pagkakaroon ng̃ isáng inaling tiwalî sa lang̃it at sa lupà,—ang dugtóng na tumatawa ni Basilio. Si Isagani mán ay nápatawá rin. —Mábanggít ng̃â palá ang ali, alám mo bang ipinagbilin sa aking hanapin ko ang kaniyáng asawa? —¿Si aling Victorina? ¿At nang̃akò ka namán upang huwag kang mawalán ng̃ iniirog? —¡Mangyari pá! Ng̃unì’t ang bagay nitó’y sa bahay pa namán ng̃ amaín ko.... nagkakanlóng ang asawa. Kapuwâ silá nagkatawánan. —Itó ang sanhî,—ang pátuloy ni Isagani—kung kayâ ang aking amaín, taong matalino, ay ayaw pumasok sa kámara, dahil sa nang̃ing̃ilag na bakâ itanóng sa kaniyá ni aling Victorina, si D. Tiburcio. ¡Akalàín mo bang ng̃ mabatíd ni aling Victorina na ang bayad ko’y “de tercera” ay tiningnán akó ng̃ warì pakutyâ.... [22]Nang mg̃a sandalîng iyón ay pumapanaog si Simoun, at ng̃ mákita ang dalawáng binatà ay: —¡Abá, Basilio!,—ang batìng may kiyás mapag-ampón—¿Patung̃o bagá kayó sa pagpapahing̃á? Ang ginoo ba’y kababayan ninyó? Ipinakilala ni Basilio si Isagani at ipinabatíd na hindî silá magkababayan, ng̃unì’t ang kaniláng mg̃a bayan ay magkakalapít. Si Isagani’y tagá kabiláng baybayin. Pinagmasdán ni Simoun si Isagani, kayâ’t ng̃ mainíp itó’y hinaráp na warì hinahamon ang nagmamasíd sa kaniyá. —At ¿anó ang lagáy nang lalawigan?—ang tanóng ni Simoun na lining̃ón si Basilio. —¿Bakit, hindî pa ba ninyó kilalá? —¿Papaano bang mákikilala ko, sa hindî pa akó nátutungtong sa lupà niyá? May nagsabi sa aking nápakamaralitâ’t hindî bumibilí ng̃ mg̃a hiyás. —Hindî kamí bumíbilí, sapagkâ’t hindî namin kailang̃an—ang biglâng sagót ni Isagani, na nagdamdám. Isáng ng̃itî ang nabadhâ sa maputlâng mg̃a pisng̃í ni Simoun. —Huwag pô kayóng magalit, binatà,—ang sabi:—walâ akóng masamâng tangkâ, ng̃unì’t sa dahiláng pinatibayan sa akin, na ang lahát ng̃ curato ay nasa kamáy ng̃ mg̃a klérigong taga rito, aní ko, ay: ang mg̃a prayle ay nagpapakamatáy sa isáng curato at pinasasalamatan na ng̃ mg̃a pransiskano yaong pinakamarálitâ, kayâ’t pag ganyáng ipinauubayà nilá sa mg̃a klérigo ay sa dahiláng doon ay hindî kilalá ang mukhâ ng̃ harì. ¡Siyá, mg̃a ginoo, halina kayóng magsiinóm ng̃ serbesa, patungkol sa ikatitigháw ng̃ Lalawigan! Ang mg̃a binatà’y nagpasalamat at nagsabing hindî silá umíinóm ng̃ serbesa, upáng makaiwas. —Masamâ iyang ginágawâ ninyó,—ang sabi ni Simoun na masamâ ang loob;—ang serbesa ay isáng mabuting bagay, at náding̃ig kong sinabi kang̃inang umaga ni P. Camorra, na ang kakulang̃án sa lakás na nápupuná sa bayang ito, ay alinsunod sa napakaraming túbig na iniinóm ng̃ mg̃a tao rito. Si Isagani na halos kasingtaas ng̃ mag-aalahás, ay tumuwíd: —Sabihin ninyó kay P. Camorra,—ang sábi kaagád ni Basilio, na sinikóng palihím si Isagani—sabihin ninyó sa [23]kanyá, na kung tubig ang iníinóm niyá at hindî alak ó serbesa, marahil ay ikabuti ng̃ lahát at hindî pá siyá magigíng sanhî ng̃ bulungbulung̃an...... —At sabihin ninyó sa kaniyá—ang dugtóng ni Isagani, na hindî pinuná ang pagsikó ng̃ kanyáng kaibigan—na ang tubig ay matamís at napaiinóm, ng̃unì’t lumulunod sa alak at sa serbesa at pumapatáy sa apóy; na pag pinaiinit ay nagigíng sulák, na pag namumuhî ay nagigíng karagatang malawak at minsán ay pumugnáw na sa katauhan at pinapang̃iníg ang mundó. Itinaas ni Simoun ang ulo, at kahìt ang ting̃ín niya’y hindî makita dahil sa pagkatakíp ng̃ salamíng asúl, ay nákita sa kaniyáng mukhâ ang paghang̃à. —¡Mainam na tugón!—ang sabi—ng̃unì’t nang̃ang̃ambá akóng bakâ idaan sa birò at itanóng sa akin kung kailán magiging sulák ang tubig at kung kailán magiging karagatang malawak. Si P. Camorra ay may pagka hindî pániwalaín at napakápalabirô. —Pag siya’y pinainit ng̃ apóy, pag ang mumuntîng ilog na sa ng̃ayó’y nagkakáhiwahiwaláy pa sa kaníkaniláng madawag na pinanggagaling̃an ay magkaisáng bumuhos na abóy ng̃ kasawían sa bang̃íng hinuhukay ng̃ mg̃a tao—ang sagót ni Isagani. —Huwag, ginoong Simoun—ang dugtóng ni Basilio na inihulog sa birò ang sálitàan.—Ang mabuti pa’y ulitin ninyó sa kaniyá ang mg̃a tulâng itó, ng̃ kaibigang Isagani: Kamí ay tubig at kayó’y apóy ang wikà ninyó; ¡kamí’y sang-ayon! mamuhay tayo ng̃ mahinaho’t huwag patanáw sa sunog, ng̃ayón, na magkababág! Kun di magtulong sa lilim niyong bihasang dunong. Sa loob niyong isáng kaldera, waláng sigalót at pagbabaka’y gawín ang sulák, na, ikalima sa elemento, na magbubung̃a niyóng liwanag, ilaw, pagtumpá sa karapata’t pagkabihasâ. [24]—¡Walâng pangyayari, walâng pangyayari!—ang biglâng sagót ni Simoun—ang mákina ay hahanapin pa...... samantala’y tutungâin ko ang aking serbesa. At iniwan ng̃ walâng paalam ang dalawáng magkaibigan. —Ng̃unì’t anó ka ba mayroon at nápakamapanghamók ka ng̃ayón?—ang tanóng ni Basilio. —Walâ, aywan ko, ng̃unì’t ang taong iyan ay nakasisindák sa akin, halos nakatatakot. —Sinísikó kitá, é: ¿hindî mo nálalamang ang tawag diyan ay Cardenal Moreno? —Cardenal Moreno? —O Eminencia negra, kung papaano mo ibig. —Hindî kitá máwatasan! —Si Richelieu ay may isáng tanung̃ang kaputsino na pinang̃anláng Eminencia Gris; itó’y siya namáng tánung̃an ng̃ General...... —¿Siya ng̃â bá? —Gayón ang nading̃íg ko sa ilán...... na nagmumurá sa kaniyá kung siya’y nakatalikód, at pinupuri siyá kung kaharáp. —¿Dumadalaw din bá kay kapitáng Tiago? —Mulâ ng̃ unang araw nang kaniyáng pagdatíng, at ang katunayan ay may isáng nag-aakalàng kaagáw niyá...... sa pagmamamana...... At ináakalà ko na makikipagkita sa General tungkól sa usap na ukol sa pagtuturò ng̃ wikàng kastilà. Nang sandalîng iyon ay lumapit ang isáng alilà upang sabihin kay Isagani na tinatawag ng̃ kaniyáng amaín. Sa isáng bankô sa popa at kasalamuhà ng̃ ibáng kasakáy ay nakaupô ang isáng klérigo na minamasdán ang anyô ng̃ mg̃a tánawing nagdadaan sa kaniyáng paning̃ín. Niluluwagan siyá ng̃ kaniyáng mg̃a kalapít; pag nagdáraan sa tabí niyá ang mg̃a lalaki’y nang̃agpupugay at ang mg̃a mánunugal ay hindî nakapang̃ang̃ahás na ilagáy ang dulang na pinaglalarûan sa kalapít niyá. Ang parìng iyon ay bibihiràng magsalitâ, hindî humihitìt ni hindî umaanyông mapagmataás, hindî nahihiyâng makihalò sa ibáng tao at tumutugóng malumanay at maayos sa mg̃a pagpupugay sa kaniyá na warìng ikinadadang̃al niyá at kinikilala ang gayón. Siya’y lubhâng matandâ na, ang buhók ay pawàng putî, ng̃unì’t ang kaniyang pang̃ang̃atawán ay mabuti, at, kahit nakaupô ay tuwíd ang katawán at taás ang ulo, dátapwá’y [25]hindî mapagmalakí at mapalalò. Náiibá sa karamihan ng̃ klérigong indio, na lubhâ namáng kauntî, na ng̃ kapanahunang iyon ay gumáganáp sa pagkakoadhutor ó nang̃ang̃asiwàng pangsamantalá sa ilang kurato, dahil sa kaniyáng pagkamalumanay at ugalìng tuwíd na tagláy noong may lubós na pagkákilala sa karang̃alan ng̃ kaniyáng kalagayan at kabanalan ng̃ kaniyáng tinútungkól. Isáng muntîng pagsisiyasat sa kaniyáng anyô, kundî man dahil sa kaniyáng buhók na putî, ay mapag-uunawà kaagád na siya’y náuukol sa malayòng panahón, sa nakaraang kapanahunan, noong ang mg̃a mabubuting binatà ay hindî nang̃ing̃imìng ilaán ang kaniláng karang̃alan sa pagiging parì, noong ang mg̃a klérigo ay kasingpantáy sa kalagayan ng̃ sino mang prayle, at noong ang kagaya niya, na hindî pá dusta at alimura, ay humíhing̃î ng̃ mg̃a taong malayà at hindî alipin, matatayog na pag-iisip at hindî budhîng apí. Sa kaniyáng mukhâng malungkót at anyông mapagtapát ay napagkikilala ang katiwasayán ng̃ kaniyáng kaluluwang pinatibayan ng̃ pag-aaral at pagkukurò, at marahil ay sinubukan na ng̃ mg̃a sariling pagtitiís ng̃ damdamin. Ang klérigong iyón ay si P. Florentino na amaín ni Isaganí at ang kasaysayan ng̃ kaniyang buhay ay lubhâng maiklî. Anák ng̃ isáng lipìng mayaman at kilalá sa Maynilà, mainam ang tindíg at may kasapatáng mábantóg, ay hindî nagkaroon kailan man ng̃ hilig sa pagpaparì; ng̃unì’t dahil sa iláng pang̃akò ng̃ kaniyáng Iná ay pinilit siyang pumasok sa Seminario matapos ang di kakauntìng pagtutunggalî at matindíng pagtatalo. Ang Iná’y may matíbay na pakikipagkilala sa Arsobispo, may matigás na loob at walâng pagbabago sa anómáng máisip, na gaya ng̃ sino mang babaing may pag-aakalàng umaalinsunod sa hang̃ád ng̃ Dios. Walâng nangyari sa tutol ng̃ binatàng si Florentino, hindî nagkabisà ang samò, walâng nahitâ sa pagsasabing siya’y may iniibig at gumawâ na tulóy ng̃ guló; magpaparì siya at ng̃ umabot sa dalawáng pû’t limáng taón ay naging parì; ang Arsobispo ay siyang naggawad sa kaniyá ng̃ mg̃a orden, ginanáp na lubhâng maring̃al ang unang pagmimisa, nagkaroon ng̃ tatlóng araw na pigíng at ang iná’y namatáy na masayá at siyángsiyá ang kalooban, matapos na maipamana sa anák ang lahát ng̃ kaniyang kayamanan. Ng̃unì’t sa pagtutunggalìang iyón ay tumangáp si Florentino [26]ng̃ isáng sugat na hindî na gumalíng kailán man; mg̃a iláng linggó muna bago ganapín ang una niyáng pagmimisa, ang babaing kaniyang pinakagigiliw ay nag-asawa ng̃ walâ nang pilìpilì dahil sa samâ ng̃ loob; ang dagok na iyon ay siyang pinakamahapdîng tinanggáp niyá; nanghilambót ang kaniyang budhî at ang kabuhayan ay nagíng isá niyang kinamuhîan at mabigát na dalahin. Kung dî man ang kabaitan at pagbibigáy dang̃ál sa kaniyang kalagayan ay ang pag-ibig na iyon ang nagligtás sa kaniya sa bang̃íng kinahuhulugan ng̃ parìng prayle at hindî prayle dito sa Pilipinas. Hinaráp ang kaniyáng mg̃a nasasakóp dahil sa kaniyang pagtupád sa katungkulan at pagkakahilig sa mg̃a likás na karunung̃an. Nang mangyari ang mg̃a kaguluhan noong 72 ay ipinang̃anib ni P. Florentino na siya’y mápuna dahil sa kalakihán ng̃ kinikita ng̃ kaniyang kurato, at sa dahiláng siya’y payapàng tao, ay huming̃î ng̃ pagpapahing̃á at mulâ na noon ay nanirahan nang warì’y isáng táong karaniwan sa mg̃a lupaín niláng mag-aának na nasa baybayin ng̃ dagat Pacífico. Doo’y inarugâ ang isá niyang pamangking lalaki, si Isagani, na alinsunod sa mg̃a masasamâng dilà ay anák niyá sa kaniyáng dating iniibig, ng̃ mabáo, anák sa pagkadalaga ng̃ isáng pinsan niyáng tagá Maynilà, alinsunod namán sa mg̃a lalóng nakabábatíd at hindî bulàan. Nang makita ng̃ Kapitán ng̃ bapor ang klérigo ay pinilitpilit na pumasok sa kámara at umakyát sa kubierta. Upang mapahinuhod lamang siya’y nagsabing: —Kung hindî kayó paparoon ay aakalàin ng̃ mg̃a prayle na áayaw kayóng makisama sa kanilá. Walâ nang nagawâ si P. Florentino kundî ang sumunód at ipinatawag ang kaniyang pamangkín upang pagsabihan ng̃ nangyayari at ipagbilin na huwag lalapit sa kámara samantalang siya’y nároroon. —Kung mákikita ka ng̃ Kapitán ay aanyayahan ka at magpapakalabis namán táyo. —Paraan ng̃ aking amaín!—aní ni Isagani sa sarili—walâ namáng dahilán kung dî upang huwag lamang akóng mákausap ni aling Victorina. [27] III MG̃A ALAMÁT Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten Dass ich so traurig bin! Nang bumatì si P. Florentino sa muntîng lipunán ay hindî na naghaharì doon ang pagkakainisan dahil sa nakaraáng pagtatalo. Marahil ay nakaakit sa mg̃a budhî ang masasayáng bahay sa bayan ng̃ Pasig, ang mg̃a kopa ng̃ mg̃a alak na Jeréz na tinunggâ upáng humandâ ó marahil ay ang pag-aantabáy sa isáng mabuting pananghalìan; magíng alín man sa mg̃a tinuran ang sanhî, ang katunayan, ay nang̃agtatawanan at nang̃agbibiruán na, sampû ng̃ pransiskanong payát, kahit na hindî nang̃agiing̃áy: ang kaniláng mg̃a tawa’y kahawíg ng̃ mg̃a ng̃iwî ng̃ isáng mamámatáy. —¡Masasamâng panahón!, ¡masasamâng panahón!—ang sabing tumatawa ni P. Sibyla. —¡Maano namáng huwag kayóng magsalitâ ng̃ ganyán, Vice-Rector!—ang sagót ng̃ kanónigong si P. Irene, sabáy sa pagtutulak sa luklukan noon—sa Hongkong ay malusog ang inyóng pang̃ang̃alakal at nagpapatayô kayó ng̃ mg̃a bahay na bawà’t isá ay.... ¡bá! —¡Tate, tate!—ang sagót—hindî ninyó nákikita ang aming mg̃a gugol, at ang mg̃a naninirahan sa aming mg̃a arìng lupaín ay nagsisimulâ na sa pagtutol.... —¡Siyá, siyá na ng̃ kádadaíng, pagkâ’t kung hindî ay iiyák na akó!—ang masayáng sigáw ni P. Camorra.—Kami’y hindî dumádaíng gayóng walâ kamíng mg̃a lupaín ni mg̃a banko. At alamín ninyó na nagsisimulâ na ng̃ pagtawad sa mg̃a deretsos ang aking mg̃a indio at iniuukilkil sa akin ang mg̃a taripa! Sukat bá namáng ukilkilán akó ng̃ taripa ng̃ayón, at taripa pa namán ng̃ Arsobispo na si D. Basilio Sancho, puñales, warì bagáng mulâ noon hangáng ng̃ayón ay hindî námahal ang mg̃a bagay-bagay. Ha, ha, ha! Bakit mámumura pá ang isáng binyág kay sa isáng inahíng manók? Ng̃unì’t akó’y nagtataing̃ang kawalì, sinising̃il ko hangáng saan makaabót at hindî akó dumadaíng kailán mán. Hindî kamí makamkám, anó, P. Salvi? [28]Nang mg̃a sandalîng iyón ay siyáng paglabás sa eskotilya ng̃ ulo ni Simoun. —Ng̃unì’t ¿saan bagá kayó nagsuot?—ang sigáw sa kanyá ni D. Custodio na nakalimot na sa samâ ng̃ loob:—hindî ninyó nákita ang pinakamainam sa paglalayág! —¡Psh!—ang sagót ni Simoun nang makaakyát na ng̃ túluyan;—nakákita na akó ng̃ maraming ilog at maraming tánawín, kayâ’t walâ ng̃ may kabuluhán sa akin kun dî iyóng may mg̃a alamát.... —Kung sa alamát, ay may ilán ang Pasig—ang sagót ng̃ Kapitán, na ayaw mawaláng kabuluhán ang ilog na kaniyáng nilalayagan at pinagkakakitaan ng̃ pagkabuhay,—nariyan ang Malapad-na-bató, na sinásambá noong kapanahunang hindî pá dumárating dito ang mg̃a kastilà, na umano’y tirahan ng̃ mg̃a espíritu: ng̃ mawalâ na ang pananalig diyan at masalaulà na ang bató ay nagíng tirahán ng̃ mg̃a tulisán, na mulâ sa tugatog niya’y hinaharang ang mg̃a bangkâ na nakikilaban na sa agos ay nakikilaban pá sa mg̃a tao. Nang makaraan iyon at sa kapanahunan na natin, kahit nábabakás sa kanyá ang kamáy ng̃ tao, ay may nábabanggít díng mang̃isáng̃isáng bangkâng nátataób, at kung sa paglikô ay hindî ko ginagamit ang anim kong sentido ay hindî malayòng mapabarandal sa kanyáng mg̃a tagiliran. Náriyan pá ang isáng alamát, ang sa yung̃íb ni doña Jerónima, na maibubuhay sa inyó ni P. Florentino. —Walâng hindî nakaalam niyon!—ang pawalâng báhalàng sabi ni P. Sibyla. Ng̃unì’t ni si Simoun, ni si Ben-Zayb, ni si P. Irene, ni si P. Camorra ay nakaaalám, kayâ’t hining̃î niláng isaysáy; ang ilán ay pabirô at ang ibá’y sapagkâ’t sadyâng ibig mabatíd. Ang klérigo ay umanyông pabirô, kagaya ng̃ paghilíng ng̃ ilán, gaya ng̃ pagsalaysay sa mg̃a batà ng̃ isáng sisiwa, at nagsabing: —May isáng lalaking nag-aaral na nang̃akòng pakakasal sa isáng babai, sa kanyáng bayan, at pagkatapós ay hindî na naalaala ang pang̃akò. Dahil sa pagkamatapát ng̃ babai ay inantáy-antáy ng̃ malaon ang lalaki: nakaraan ang kanyáng kabatàan, nagíng dalagsót at isáng araw ay nabalitâang ang kanyáng katipán sa pag-aasawa ay siyang Arsobispo sa Maynilà. Nagsuot lalaki at lumigid sa ung̃ós ng̃ Cabo, sa [29]pagparito, at humaráp sa Ilustrísima na hiniling̃áng tumupád sa pang̃akò. Ang kahiling̃a’y hindî mangyayari, at ipinagawâ ng̃â ng̃ Arsobispo iyang yung̃ib na nákita ninyóng may takíp at napapalamutihan sa pagpasok ng̃ mg̃a punòng gumagapang. Diyan siyá nanahán at namatáy, at diyan din siyá nálibing, at ayon sa sabisabihán ay tumatagilid si doña Jerónima kung pumapasok sa yung̃íb dahil sa katabaán. Ang kabantugan niyá sa pagkaenkantada ay buhat sa ugalì niyang paghahagis sa ilog ng̃ mg̃a kasangkapang pilak na ginagamít sa mg̃a pigíng niyang dinádaluhán ng̃ maraming ginoo. Isáng lambát ang nasa ilalim ng̃ tubig at siyang sumasahód sa mg̃a kasangkapang doon na nahuhugasan. Walâ pang dalawáng pung taón ang nakararaan na ang ilog ay dumadaang halos humáhalik sa pintúan ng̃ yung̃íb, ng̃unì’t untîuntîng lumálayô, gaya rin namán ng̃ pagkalimot ng̃ mg̃a taga rito sa kay doña Jerónima. —¡Mainam na alamát!—ani Ben-Zayb,—susulat akó ng̃ ukol diyan. Nakaaawà. Iniisip na ni aling Victorina na manirahan sa isá namáng yung̃ib at sasabihin na sana ng̃ unahan siyá ni Simoun, na nagsabing: —Ng̃unì’t anó ang palagáy ninyó sa bagay na iyón, P. Salvi—ang tanóng sa pransiskano na walâng imík dahil sa may iniisip—¿hindí bagá lalóng mabuti, sa palagáy ninyó, na dapat sanang hindî sa isáng yung̃ib siyá inilagáy ng̃ Arsobispo kung dî sa isáng beaterio, sa Santa Clara, sa halimbawâ? Galáw na pamanghâ ni P. Sibyla, na nakakitang si P. Salvi ay nang̃iníg at sumulyáp sa dako ni Simoun. —Sapagkâ’t hindî namán mainam—ang patuloy na walâng tigatig ni Simoun,—iyáng bigyán ng̃ muntîng tahanan ang mg̃a nádadayà natín; labág sa pagkamapanampalataya ang ipain siyá sa mg̃a tuksó, sa isáng yung̃ib, sa tabí ng̃ ilog; nang̃ang̃amoy ninfa ó kaya’y driada ang gayón. Marahil ay nagíng mainam pá, lalò pang kabanalan, lalò pang magandá, lalò pang kápit sa ugalì dito, ang kulung̃ín siyá sa Santa Clara, na warìng isáng bagong Eloisa, upang madalaw at mahimok maminsánminsán, ¿Anó ang sábi ninyó? —Hindî ko mahahatulan ni dapat kong hatulan ang kagagawán ng̃ mg̃a Arsobispo—ang tugóng mabigát ang loob ng̃ pransiskano. [30]—Ng̃unì’t kayó, na siyang gobernador eclesiástico, ang kahalili ng̃ Arsobispo, ¿anó ang gagawín ninyó kung sa inyó mangyari ang bagay na iyon? Kinibít ni P. Salvi ang kaniyáng balikat, at payapàng tumugón ng̃: —Walâng kabuluháng isipin ang isáng bagay na hindî mangyayari.... Datapwâ’y yayamang napag-uusapan na rin lamang ang tungkol sa mg̃a alamát, ay huwag ninyóng káligtâán ang lalòng mainam, dahil sa siyang lalóng katotohanan, ang kababalaghán ni San Nicolás, na marahil ay nákita ninyó ang mg̃a sirâng muog ng̃ kaniyáng simbahan. Ibubuhay ko kay G. Simoun na siyáng hindî dapat makaalám. Warìng noong araw ay maraming buwaya sa lawà’t sa ilog, mg̃a buwayang napakalalakí’t napakamasibà na dinudumog ang mg̃a bangkâ at pinalulubog sa hagkís ng̃ kaniláng buntót. Sinasabing isáng araw, ang isáng insík na hangga noon ay hindî pa nagbibinyagan, ay dumaraan sa harap ng̃ Simbahan, at walâng anó anó’y sásisipót sa kaniyáng harapán ang demonio, na anyông buwaya, na itinaob ang kaniyáng bangkâ upang lamunin siyá at dalhín sa Impierno. Sa tulong ng̃ Dios ay tinawagan ng̃ insík si San Nicolás at noon din ay nagíng bató ang buwaya. Sinasabi ng̃ mg̃a matatandâ na ng̃ kapanahunan nilá ay nákikilala pang maliwanag ang anyô ng̃ hayop sa putól putól na batóng nálalabí; sa ganang akin ay masasabi kong nakita ko pang malinaw ang ulo at kung huhulàan ang katawán dahil sa aking nákita ay dapat na magíng lubhâng malakí ang hayop na yaón. —¡Kahang̃ahang̃àng alamát!—ang pabulalás ni Ben-Zayb,—at magigíng sanhî ng̃ isáng salaysayín. Ang pagsasabi ng̃ anyô ng̃ háyop, ang takot ng̃ insík, ang tubig ng̃ ilog, ang kakawayanan.... At magigíng sanhî ng̃ pagsusurì ng̃ mg̃a pananampalataya. Sapagkâ’t tignán ninyó; tawagan pá namán ng̃ isáng insík na hindî binyagan, sa gitnâ ng̃ kasakunàan, ang isáng santó na hindî niyá sinasambá at marahil ay kilala lamang sa ding̃íg.... Itó’y hindî sákop noong sáwikaíng mabuti pá ang masamáng kilalá na, kay sa mabuting kikilalanin pá. Kung akó’y mápapásakainsikán at málalagay akó sa gayong kagipitan ang una ko munang tatawagan ay yaóng lalong hindî kilalang santó sa calendario kay sa kay Confusio ó Budha. Kung itó’y isáng kataasang tunay ng̃ urì ng̃ katolisismo [31]ó kaya’y kahinàan sa paghuhulò at pagka walang katibayan ng̃ pag-iisip ng̃ mg̃a lahìng diláw, ay malilinaw lamang ng̃ isang pagkilalang masusì ng̃ antropología. Si Ben-Zayb ay gumamit ng̃ kílos gurô at pinagalaw ang hintuturò sa hang̃ín, sabáy sa pagtataká sa sariling pag-iisip na marunong humang̃ò ng̃ maraming banggít at katuturán sa maliliit na bagay. At sa dahiláng nákita, na si Simoun ay nagbubulaybulay dahil sa bagay na kasasabi pá lamang niyá, ay tinanóng na kung anó ang iniisip. —Dalawáng bagay na mahalagá—ang sagót ni Simoun,—dalawáng katanung̃ang maidaragdág sa inyóng susulatin. Una: ¿anó kayâ ang nangyari sa diablo ng̃ biglâng mákulong sa bató? ¿nakatanan? ¿naiwan doon? ¿napilpíl? At ang pang̃alawá, ay kung yaóng mg̃a háyop na naging bató na nápagkitá ko sa iláng museo sa Europa, ay hindî kayâ nagkagayón ng̃ dahil namán sa iláng santóng nabuhay na una sa panahón ng̃ pag-apaw ng̃ tubig sa sangmundó? Walâng kaping̃asping̃as na birò ang pagkakasábi ng̃ mag-aalahás at itinukod pa sa noo ang kanyáng hintuturò, tandâ ng̃ malakíng pagmumunìmunì, kayâ’t si P. Camorra ay walâng kaping̃asping̃as ding sumagót na: —¡Sino ang makapagsasabi, sino ang makapagsasabi! —At yayamang mg̃a alamát ang napag-uusapan at pumapások tayo sa lawà,—ang tugón ni P. Sibyla—ang kapitán ay dapat makabatíd ng̃ marami.... Nang mg̃a sandalîng yaón ay pumapások sa wawà ang bapór at ang tánawing nasa haráp ay lubhâng mainam. Ang lahát ay nalugód. Sa harapán ay nakalátag ang magandáng lawà, na nalilibid ng̃ baybaying berde at bughaw na bulubundukin, na warìng isáng malakíng salamín na nakúkulong ng̃ palibid na pawàng esmeralda at sápiro, na sa kaniyáng lunas ay nanánalamín ang lang̃it. Sa kanan ay nakalatag ang dalampasigang mababà, na may mg̃a look na may maiinam na anyô, at doon sa malayò, halos napapawì na sa paning̃ín, nároon ang káwit ng̃ bundók Sung̃ay; sa harapán at sa hulíng dákong abót ng̃ paning̃ín ay nakatayô ang Makiling, mataás, nakahahang̃à, napuputúng̃an ng̃ manipís na úlap; at sa kaliwâ ang pulông Talím, ang Súsong-dalaga na taglay ang matatambók niyang gúhit na nagíng sanhî ng̃ kaniyáng [32]pang̃alan. Isáng malamíg na simuy ang nagpapakulót sa malápad na ibabaw ng̃ túbig. —Maala-ala ko palá, Kapitán—ang sábi ni Ben-Zayb, na kasabáy ang pagling̃ón—¿alám bagá nínyó kung saan dako ng̃ lawà nápatay ang isáng nagng̃ang̃alang Guevara, Navarra ó Ibarra? Lahát ay nápating̃ín sa Kapitán, tang̃ì lamang si Simoun na ibinaling ang mukhâ sa kabilâng dáko, na warîng may hinahánap sa dalampasigan. —¡Ay siyá ng̃â!—ani aling Victorina,—¿saan Kapitán? ¿nakaiwan kayâ ng̃ bakás sa tubig? Kumindát ng̃ makailán ang tinátanóng, bilang katunayan na laban sa kanyáng kalooban ang katanung̃an; ng̃unì’t ng̃ mabatyág ang samò sa mg̃a matá ng̃ lahát, ay lumápit ng̃ iláng hakbáng sa unahán ng̃ bapór at minataan ang baybayin. —Tuming̃ín kayó roón—ang sabing marahan, matapos na maunawàng walâng ibáng tao:—alinsunod sa Cabo na nang̃ulo sa pag-uusig, ng̃ makita ni Ibarra na siya’y nakúkulóng, ay lumunsád sa bangkâ, sa malapit sa Kinabutasan at sa kásisisid ay linang̃óy ang habàng may dalawáng milla, na hinahábol siya ng̃ punlô kailán ma’t ilálabas ang ulo sa tubig upang huming̃á. Sa dako pa roon ay hindî na siya nákita, at sa malayôlayô pa, sa may pangpáng, ay nakakita ng̃ warì’y kulay dugô. At ng̃ayón ang ikalabíng tatlóng taón ng̃ pangyayari, na walâng kulang at labis na araw. —¿Kung gayón, ang kaniyáng bangkáy?...—ang tanóng ni Ben-Zayb. —Ay nakisama sa bangkáy ng̃ kaniyáng amá,—ang sagót ni P. Sibyla;—¿hindî bá isá ring pilibustero, P. Salvi? —Iyán ang mg̃a murang libíng, P. Camorra, ¿anó?—ang sábi ni Ben-Zaib. —Lagì ng̃ sinasabisabi ko, na pilibustero ang mg̃a hindî bumabayad ng̃ maring̃al na libíng—ang sagót na tumatawa ng̃ tinukoy. —Ng̃unì’t ¿anó ang nangyayari sa inyó G. Simoun?—ang tanóng ni Ben-Zayb nang makitang ang mag-aalahás ay nakatigil at nag-iísip—¿Nahihilo bagá kayó, kayóng mapaglakbáy, sa isáng paták na tubig na kagaya nitó? [33]—Ang masasabi ko sa inyó,—ang sagót ng̃ Kapitán na nagkaroón na ng̃ giliw sa mg̃a pook na iyón;—huwag ninyóng pang̃anlán itó ng̃ paták na túbig: itó’y malakí sa alín man sa mg̃a lawà sa Suisa at malakí pa kahit pagpisanin ang lahát ng̃ lawà sa España; nakákita akó ng̃ matatandâng mangdaragát na nang̃aliyó rito. IV SI KABISANG TALES Ang mg̃a nakabasa ng̃ unang bahagi ng̃ kabuhayang itó, ay maaalaala marahil ang isáng matandâng magkakahóy na naninirahan doon sa kalookan ng̃ isáng gubat. Si Tandâng Selo ay buháy pá at kahi’t ang kaniyáng buhók ay pumutî na ay mabuti rin ang kaniyáng katawán. Hindî na nanghuhuli sa bitag at hindî na rín nagpuputól ng̃ káhoy; sa dahiláng bumuti na ang kabuhayan ay naggagawâ na lamang ng̃ walís. Ang kaniyáng anák na si Tales (palayaw ng̃ Telesforo) ay nakisamá muna sa isáng namumuhunan; ng̃unì’t ng̃ malaunan, ng̃ magkaroon ng̃ dalawáng kalabáw at mg̃a iláng daáng piso, ay gumawâ na sa sarili, na katulong ang kaniyáng amá, ang kaniyáng asawa at ang kaniyáng tatlóng anák. Hinawan ng̃â at lininís ang makapál na gúbat na nasa labasan ng̃ bayan na inakalà niláng walâng may-arì. Nang kaniláng ginágawâ ang lupà at máayos ay linagnát na isá isá siláng mag-aanak at namatáy ang Iná at anák na pang̃anay na si Lucía, na nasa katamtamang gulang. Ang bagay na iyón na sadyáng ibiníbigáy ng̃ pagkakabungkál ng̃ lupà na saganà sa sarisarìng bágay, ay inakalà niláng higantí ng̃ mg̃a lamán-lupàng naninirahan sa gubat, kayâ’t kinalamay nilá ang kaniláng loob at ipinagpatuloy ang gawàin sa pag-asang lumipas na ang pagkamuhî ng̃ espíritu. Nang aanihin na ang unang taním ay inangkín ang mg̃a lupàng iyón ng̃ isáng “Corporación” ng̃ mg̃a prayle na may pag-aarì sa bayang kalapít, na ang ikinakatwiran ay nasa sa loob ng̃ kaniláng mg̃a hanganan, at upáng mapatunayan ang gayón ay itinayô noon dín ang kaniláng mg̃a muhón. Gayón [34]man, ay pinabayàan siyá ng̃ tagapang̃asiwà ng̃ mg̃a parì upang pag-anihan, kailan man at magbabayad siyá sa taón taón ng̃ isáng muntîng halagá, isáng walâng gaano, dalawáng pû ó tatlóng pûng piso. Si Tales, na mabaít sa dilàng mabaít, ayaw sa usapín na gaya ng̃ ibá at masunurin sa mg̃a praile gaya ng̃ ilán, sa pag-iwas na ibunggô ang isáng palyók sa isáng kawalì, gaya ng̃ sábi niyá, (sa ganáng kanya’y kasangkapang bakal ang mg̃a prayle at siya’y kasankapang pútik), ay umalinsunod sa kahiling̃an, dahil sa naisip niyáng siya’y hindî marunong ng̃ wikàng kastilà at walâng maibabayad sa mg̃a tagapagtanggol. At sakâ sinabi sa kanyá ni tandâng Selo, na: —Tiisín mo na! malakí pá ang magugugol mo sa pakikipag-usapín ng̃ isáng taón kay sa magbayad ng̃ makásampû ng̃ hinihilíng ng̃ mg̃a parìng putî. ¡Hmh! Marahil ay gantihín ka namán nilá ng̃ misa. Ipagpalagáy mong ang tatlóng pûng pisong iyán ay natalo sa sugal, ó kayâ’y nahulog sa túbig at kinain ng̃ buwaya. Ang ani ay nagíng masaganà, nábilí sa mabuting halagá, at inisip ni Tales ang magtayô ng̃ isáng bahay na tablá sa nayon ng̃ Sapang, ng̃ bayang Tiani, na kalapít ng̃ San Diego. Nakaraán ang isá pang taón at dumatíng ang isá pang mabuting ani, at dahil sa paganitó ó pagayóng sanhî ay ginawâ ng̃ mg̃a prayle na limáng pûng piso ang canon, na pinagbayaran namán ni Tales upang huwag siláng magkagalít at sa dahiláng umasang maipagbibilí sa mabuting halagá ang asukal. —¡Tiisin mo na! Ibilang mong lumakí ang buwaya,—ang páyo ni matandâng Selo. Nang taóng yaón ay naganáp ang kaniláng pang̃arap: manirahan sa bayan, sa kaniláng bahay na tablá sa nayon ng̃ Sapang, at inisip ng̃ amá at ng̃ nunò ang papag-aralin ang dalawáng magkapatíd, lalònglalò na ang babai, si Juliana ó Hulî, gaya ng̃ kaniláng tawag, na magiging magandá sa warì. Isáng batàng lalaki, si Basilio, na kaniláng kaibigan at kagaya rin nilá sa urì ay nag-aaral na noon sa Maynilà. Ng̃unì’t ang pang̃arap na itó’y warìng ukol sa hindî pangyayari. Ang unang ginawâ ng̃ bayan, ng̃ mákita ang untîuntîng pagtigháw nilá, ay ang paghahalal na kabisa sa pinakamalakás na gumawâ sa mag-aanak; ang anák na pang̃anay [35]na si Tanò ay may labíng apat na taón pá lamang. Tinawag na ng̃âng kabisang Tales, nang̃ailang̃ang magpagawâ ng̃ chaqueta, bumilí ng̃ isáng sambalilong pieltro at humandâ sa paggugugol. Upang huwag makipagkagalít sa Kura at sa Pamahalàan ay pinagpapaluwalan niya ang náaalís sa padrón, ipinagbabayad ang mg̃a umaalís at namamatáy, nag-aaksayá ng̃ maraming panahón sa panining̃íl at pagtung̃o sa Cabecera. —¡Magtiís ka na! Ipagpalagáy mong dumatíng ang mg̃a kamag-ának ng̃ buwaya,—ang sabing nakang̃itî ni tandâng Selo. —Sa taóng dárating ay magsusuot ka na ng̃ de cola at paparoon ka sa Maynilà, upang mag-aral na gáya ng̃ mg̃a dalaga sa bayan!—ang sabí-sabí ni kabisang Tales sa kaniyáng anák kailan ma’t mádiding̃íg dito ang mg̃a pagkatuto ni Basilio. Ng̃unì’t ang taóng dáratíng na iyon ay hindî sumasapit at sa kanyá’y nápapalít ang pagdaragdág sa buwís ng̃ lupà; natubigan na si kabisang Tales at nagkakamót ng̃ ulo. Ibiníbigáy na ng̃ lutùang putik ang kaniyáng bigás sa caldero. Nang umabot sa dalawáng daang piso ang canon ay hindî na nagkasiyá si kabisang Tales sa pagkamot sa ulo at pagbubuntóng hining̃á: tumutol at bumulóngbulóng. Nang mangyari ang gayón ay sinabi sa kaniyá ng̃ prayleng tagapang̃asiwà, na, kung hindî siyá makababayad ay ibá ang magtataním sa mg̃a lupàng yaón. Maraming may nasà ang nagbabayad. Inakalà ni kabisang Tales na nagbíbirô ang prayle, ng̃unì’t tinótotoó ng̃ parì ang pagsasalitâ’t itinuturò ang isá sa mg̃a alilà niyá na siyáng kukuha ng̃ lupà. Ang kaawàawàng tao’y namutlâ, ang taing̃a niya’y umugong, isáng mapuláng ulap ang tumakíp sa kaniyáng paning̃ín at doo’y namalas ang kaniyáng asawa’t anák na babaing nang̃amumutlâ, yayát, naghíhing̃alô, dahil sa walâng gisaw na lagnát. At pagkatapos ay namalas ang makapál na gubat na nagíng bukirín, namalas niyá ang agos ng̃ pawis na dumídilíg sa mg̃a lubák, namalas niyá siyá, siyá rín, ang kaawaawàng si Tales, na nag-aararo sa gitnâ ng̃ arawán, na nasusugatan ang mg̃a paa sa mg̃a bató’t tuód, samantalang ang uldóg na iyón ay nagliliwalíw na nakasakáy sa isáng sasakyán at yaóng kukuha ng̃ kaniyáng arì ay súsunódsunód na gaya ng̃ isáng alipin sa kaniyáng pang̃inoon. ¡Ah, hindî! ¡makálilibong hindî! Lumubóg na muna ang mg̃a kaparang̃ang yaón sa káilaliman ng̃ lupà at málibíng [36]na siláng lahát. ¿Sino ang dayuhang iyón upang magkaroon ng̃ karapatáng makapag-arì sa kaniyáng mg̃a lupaín? ¿Nagdalá bagá siya ng̃ pumarito ng̃ isáng dakót man lamang ng̃ alabók na iyón? ¿Nabaluktót bagá ang isá man sa mg̃a dalirì niyá sa pagbunot ng̃ isáng ugát man lamang na nanuód doon? Bugnót na sa mg̃a pagbabalà ng̃ prayle na nag-aakalàng papagharìin ang kaniyáng mg̃a karapatán sa lahát ng̃ paraan, sa haráp ng̃ ibáng naninirahan doon ay nagmatigás si kabisang Tales, ayaw magbáyad, ni isá mang kualta, at dalá rin sa haráp ang mapuláng ulap, ay sinabing ipagkakaloob lamang niyá ang kaniyáng mg̃a bukirín sa dumilíg muna doón ng̃ dugô ng̃ kaniyáng mg̃a ugát. Nang makita ni matandâng Selo ang mukhâ ng̃ kaniyáng anák, ay hindî nakapang̃ahás na banggitín ang buwaya, ng̃unì’t tinangkâ niyáng paglubagín sa pagsasabi ng̃ ukol sa mg̃a kasangkapang pútik at ipinaalaala, na sa mg̃a usapín, ang nananalo’y nawáwalán ng̃ barò’t salawál. —Sa alabók tayo mauuwî, amá, at walâ tayong damít ng̃ sumilang sa malíwang!—ang sagót. At nagmatigás na sa hindî pagbabayad ni ibigáy ang isáng dangkal man lamang ng̃ kaniyáng lupà, kung hindî ipakikilala muna ng̃ mg̃a prayle ang katibayan ng̃ kaniláng paghahabol sa paraan ng̃ pagpapakita ng̃ kahi’t anóng kasulatan. At sa dahiláng walâng máipakita ang mg̃a prayle ay nagkaroón ng̃ usapín, at tinanggáp ang gayón ni kabisang Tales sa pag-asang kundî man ang lahát ay may iláng lumiling̃ap sa katwiran at gumagalang sa mg̃a kautusán. —Naglilingkód akó at marami ng̃ taóng akó’y naglilingkód sa harì, sa tulong ng̃ aking salapî at mg̃a pagpapagod,—ang sábi sa mg̃a nagwiwikàng walâ siyáng mararatíng:—hiníhilíng ko sa kaniyá ng̃ayón na ling̃apín ang aking katwiran at liling̃apín niyá akó. At akay ng̃ isáng kasawíán at parang sa usapín ay nátatayâ ang kaniyáng kabuhayan sa araw ng̃ búkas at ang sa kaniyáng mg̃a anák, ay ginugol ang kaniyáng naiipon sa pagbabayad sa mg̃a abogado, escribano at procurador, na hindî pa kabilang dito ang mg̃a kawaní at mg̃a taga-sulat na sinasamantalá ang kaniyáng kamangmang̃án at kalagayan. Yao’t dito siyá sa pang̃ulong bayan ng̃ lalawigan, nakararaan siyá ng̃ boong maghapon [37]na hindî kumakain at hindî nátutulóg, at ang kaniyáng pakikipagusap ay pawàng tungkol sa mg̃a kasulatan, pagharáp, paghahabol sa lalòng may mataás na kapangyarihan, ibp. Noon nákita ang isáng labanáng hindî pá námamasdán sa silong ng̃ lang̃it ng̃ Pilipinas: ang sa isáng marálitâng indio, mangmáng at walâng mg̃a kaibigan, tiwalà sa kaniyáng katwiran at sa kabutihan ng̃ kaniyáng pinag-uusig, na nakikilaban sa isáng malakás na “corporación” na niyuyukuán ng̃ kapangyarihan at sa haráp niyá’y binibitiwan ng̃ mg̃a hukóm ang kaniláng timbang̃an at isinusukò ang kaniláng tabák. Mapilit sa pakikitunggalî na warìng langgám na kumákagát, gayóng nakikilalang siyá’y matitirís, warìng lang̃aw na tinátanaw ang kalawakang walâng hanggán sa likód ng̃ isáng salamín. ¡Ah! Ang kasangkapang lupà, sa pakikipaglaban sa mg̃a caldero, ay may nakahahang̃à ring anyô, sa pagkadurog: tagláy niyá ang kaigting̃án ng̃ pagdumog ng̃ walâng pag-asa. Sa mg̃a araw na hindî siyá naglalakbáy, ay dinadaán niyá sa paglilibót sa kaniyáng bukirín na dalá ang isáng baríl, sinásabisabí niyáng ang mg̃a tulisán ay nangloloob at nang̃ang̃ailang̃áng magtanggol siyá upang huwag mahulog sa kaniláng mg̃a kamáy at matalo ang úsap. At warìng pagsasanay sa pagtudlâ ay binabaríl ang mg̃a ibon at mg̃a bung̃ang káhoy, bumabaríl ng̃ mg̃a paróparó ng̃ walâng kalihíslihís, kayâ’t ang tagapang̃asiwàng uldóg ay hindî na nang̃ahás na tumung̃o sa Sapang kung walâng kasamang mg̃a guardia sibil, at ang palamon ng̃ parì na nakakita sa magandáng tíkas ni kabisang Tales na naglilibót sa kaniyáng bukirín na warì’y isáng bantáy, ay umayáw nang lipús ng̃ tákot na kunin ang pag-aarì. Datapwâ’y hindî makapang̃ahás na bigyán siyáng katwiran ng̃ mg̃a hukóm pamayapà sa bayan at nang nasa cabecera, dahil sa natatakot maalís sa katungkulan, sapagkâ’t nadadalâ na dahil sa isáng kaagad-agad ay inalís.

At ang lahát ng̃ hukóm na iyon, na ang marami sa kanilá’y may mg̃a budhî at may malinis na hilig, ay nag-aakalàng ang lalòng pinakamabuti niláng magagawâ ay ang himukin sa pagkakasundô, sa paraang magbayad si kabisang Tales ng̃ buwís na hinihing̃î. Ng̃unì’t si Tales, gaya ng̃ sinomang may maiklîng paghuhulò, ay patuloy sa layon, kailan ma’t nakakábanaag ng̃ katwiran. Humihing̃î ng̃ mg̃a katunayan, katibayan, kasulatan, título, ng̃unì’t walâng máipakita ang mg̃a prayle at walâng pinanghahawakan kundî ang mg̃a nakaraang pag-alinsunód. Datapwâ’y, ang tutol namán ni kabisang Tales: —Kung sa araw araw ay naglilimós akó sa isáng pulube upang huwag na lamang akóng yamutín ¿sino ang makapipilit sa akín na magpatuloy akó sa pagbibigay, kung nagpapakasagwâ namán? At walâng makapag-patinag sa kaniyá sa gayón at walâ namáng bantâng makapagpalubág sa kaniyá. Walâng nangyari sa Gobernador M.... na naglakbáy at sinadyâ siyá upang takutin; ang lahát ay sinasagót niyá nang: —Magagawâ ninyó ang ibig gawín, G. Gobernador, akó’y isáng mangmáng at walâ akóng lakás. Ng̃unì’t inayos ko ang mg̃a bukiríng itó, ang asawa ko’t anák ay nang̃amatáy sa pagtulong sa akín sa paglilinis, kayâ’t hindî ko siyá maipagkákaloob [39]sa sino mang hindî makagawâ sa kanilá ng̃ higít sa ginawâ ko. Diligín muna silá ng̃ dugô ng̃ nagnanasà at ilibíng sa kanilá ang asawa’t anák. Ang kinahinatnán, sa katigasang itó ng̃ ulo, ay ang bigyán ng̃ katwiran ang mg̃a prayle ng̃ mg̃a matapát na hukóm, at siya’y pinagtátawanán ng̃ balà na at pinagsasabihan pang hindî naipapanalo ang mg̃a usapín ng̃ dahil sa katwiran. Gayon man ay patuloy din siyá sa paghahabol, linalagyán ng̃ punlô ang kaniyáng baríl at mahinahong liniligíd ang kaniyáng lupaín. Sa kapanahunang iyón ay warìng isáng pang̃arap ang kaniyáng kabuhayan. Ang kaniyáng anák na si Tanò, binatàng kasingtaas ng̃ amá, at gaya ng̃ kapatíd na babai sa kabutihan, ay násundalo; pinabayàan niyáng lumakad at hindî ibinayad ng̃ mákakapalít. —Magbabayad akó sa mg̃a abogado,—ang sabi sa anák na babaing umíiyák:—kung manalo akó sa usapín ay mapababalík ko siyá, ng̃unì’t kung akó’y matalo ay hindî ko kailang̃an ang anák. Lumakad ang anák at ang tang̃ìng balitàng tinanggáp ay ang pinutulan ng̃ buhók at natutulog sa ilalim ng̃ isáng karreta. Nang makaraan ang anim na buwan ay may nagsabing nákitang dinalá sa Carolinas; may iláng nagbabalitàng tila nákitang suot guardia sibil. —¡Guardia sibil si Tanò! ¡Susmariosep!—ang pamanghâ ng̃ ilán na sabáy sa pagtatalukob kamáy:—¡Si Tanò na napakabuti at napakabaít! ¡Rekimeternam! May iláng araw na hindî binatì ng̃ nunò ang amá, si Hulî ay nagkasakít, ng̃unì’t hindî tumulò ang isá mang paták na luhà ni kabisang Tales; dalawáng araw na hindî umalís sa bahay, na warìng nang̃ang̃ambá sa pagsisi ng̃ kaniyáng mg̃a kanayon; natatakot tawaging siyáng pumatáy sa kaniyáng anák. Ng̃unì’t ng̃ ikatlóng araw ay mulîng lumabás na dalá ang kaniyáng baríl. May nagsapantahà na siya’y may nasàng pumatáy ng̃ tao at may isáng nagsabi na náding̃íg umanóng ibinúbulóng niyá ang balàng ibaón ang uldóg sa mg̃a lubák ng̃ kaniyáng bukirín; kayâ’t mulâ noo’y kinatakutan na siyáng lubhâ ng̃ prayle. Dahil dito’y pumanaog ang isáng utos ng̃ Capitán General na nagbabawal ng̃ paggamit ng̃ baríl at ipinasásamsám na lahát. Ibinigáy ni kabisang Tales ang kaniyáng [40]baríl, ng̃unì’t nagpatuloy dín sa kaniyáng pagbabantáy na ang dalá ay isáng mahabàng iták. —¿Anó ang gágawin mo sa iták na iyán sa ang mg̃a tulisán ay may baríl?—ang sabi sa kaniyá ni matandâng Selo. —Kailang̃an kong bantayán ang aking mg̃a pananím,—ang sagót;—ang bawà’t isáng tubó doon ay isáng butó ng̃ aking asawa. Inalisán siyá ng̃ iták dahil sa nápakahabà. Ang ginawâ namán niyá ay kinuha ang matandâng palakol ng̃ kaniyáng amá at ipinatuloy ang kaniyáng paglalakád na nakapang̃ing̃ilabot. Si matandâng Selo at si Hulî ay nang̃ang̃ambá sa tuwîng áalís siyá ng̃ bahay. Si Hulî ay títindíg sa habihán, dudung̃aw, nagdádasal ng̃ mg̃a nobena. Ang matandâ namán ay hindî mátumpák kung minsán sa pagyarì ng̃ buklód ng̃ walís at násasabisabíng pagbábalikán ang gubat. Ang pamumuhay sa bahay na iyón ay nápakahirap. Nangyari din ang kinatatakutan. Sa dahiláng ang bukid ay malayò sa pook ng̃ mg̃a bahay, kahì’t na may palakól si kabisang Tales ay nabihag ng̃ mg̃a tulisán, na may mg̃a rebolber at baríl. Sinabi sa kaniyá ng̃ mg̃a tulisán na yamang mayroon siyáng náibabayad sa mg̃a hukóm at tagatanggol-usap ay dapat din namán siyáng magkaroon ng̃ máibibigay sa mg̃a náwawakawak sa kabuhayan at mg̃a pinag-uusig. Dahil doon ay hining̃án siyá ng̃ limáng daang pisong tubós sa pamag-itan ng̃ isáng tagabukid at pinatibayan pang pag may nangyari sa utusán ay itítimbáng ang búhay ng̃ dakíp. Dalawáng araw ang ibinigáy na taning. Ikinasindák na lubhâ ng̃ mag-anak ang balità at lalò pa mandíng naragdagán ang gayón, ng̃ mabatíd na lálabás ang Guardia sibil upang usigin ang mg̃a tulisán. Kung magkátagpô at magkálabanán ay alám ng̃ lahát na ang unang mápapatáy ay ang dakíp. Nang tanggapín ang balità’y hindî nakatinag ang matandâ, at ang anák na babai, sa gitnâ ng̃ pamumutlâ’t pagkasindák, ay makáilàng nagnasàng mang̃usap, ng̃unì’t hindî nangyari. Datapwâ’y isáng hinalàng lalòng mabigát ang nakapagpabalík sa kaniláng diwà. Ang sabi ng̃ tagabukid na inutusan ng̃ mg̃a tulisán, ay marahil magsisilayô silá, kayâ’t kung magluluwát [41]sa pagbibigáy ng̃ tubós ay lalawig ang araw at si kabisang Tales ay pupugutan ng̃ ulo. Ang sabing itó’y nakatulíg sa dalawá, na kapuwâ mahihinà at kapuwâ walâng magawâ. Si tandâng Selo ay mápaupô’t mapatindíg, akyát manaog, hindî malaman ang tung̃uhin, hindî malaman ang lapitan. Si Hulî’y padulógdulóg sa kaniyáng mg̃a larawan ng̃ santó, ulî’t ulîng binilang ang salapî, ng̃unì’t ang dalawáng daang piso’y hindî nararagdagán, ayaw dumami, bigláng magbibihis, iipunin ang lahát ng̃ kaniyáng hiyás, hihing̃îng sangunì sa matandâ, tatangkâíng makipagkita sa Kapitán, sa hukóm, sa tagasulat, at sa teniente ng̃ Guardia sibil. Oo ang sagót ng̃ matandâ sa lahát, at pag sinabi ng̃ batàng huwag ay huwag dín namán siyá. Dumatíng ang iláng babaing kapitbahay na kamag-anakan at kakilala, mg̃a marálitâ, at may maralitâ pa kay sa ibá, mg̃a walâng malay na tao at minámalakí ang lahát ng̃ bagáy. Ang pinakamatalas sa lahát ay ang pusakál na pagingera na si Hermana Balî na nanirahan sa Maynilà upang mag ejercicio sa beaterio ng̃ La Compañía. Ipagbibilí ni Hulî ang lahát ng̃ kaniyáng mg̃a hiyás liban lamang ang isáng agnós na may brillante at esmeralda na bigáy ni Basilio. Ang agnós na iyon ay may kasaysayan; ibinigáy ng̃ monja na anák ni kapitáng Tiago sa isáng ketong̃in, dahil sa pagkakagamót ni Basilio sa may sakít ay ibinigáy nitó na parang isáng handóg. Hindî niyá máipagbilí hanggáng hindî maalaman ng̃ nagbigáy.

Maaarìng isanglâ ang agnós, ng̃unì’t nápailíng si Hulî. Iminunkahì ng̃ isáng kalapít na ipagbilí ang bahay, bagay na sinangayunan ni tandâng Selo ng̃ boông lugód, sapagkâ’t bábalík sa gubat upang makapang̃ahoy na mulî na gaya noong una, ng̃unì’t ang gayón ay hindî mangyayari ang sábi ni Hermana Balî sa dahiláng walâ ang tunay na may-arì. —Minsan ay pinagbilhan akó ng̃ isáng tápis ng̃ asawa ng̃ hukóm, sa halagáng piso, at kadumatdumat ay sinabi ng̃ asawa na walâ raw kabuluhán ang bilihang iyon sapagkâ’t walâ siyang malay. ¡Abá!

Tátanung̃ín sana ng̃ isáng kalapít kung bakit hindî siyá pinagbabayaran ni Hma. Balî sa isáng maliit na utang, ng̃unì’t natalasan ng̃ pangingera, kayâ’t nagpatuloy kaagád: —¿Alam mo Hulî ang mabuti mong gawín? Isanglâ mo muna sa halagáng dalawáng daan at limáng pùng piso ang bahay, sanlâng pagbabayaran hanggáng sa manalo ang usap. Itó ang pinakamabuti sa mg̃a balak, kayâ’t tinangkâng gawín noon ding araw na iyon. Sinamahan ni Hermana Balî at linibot nilá ang lahát ng̃ bahay ng̃ mayayaman sa Tiani, ng̃unì’t walâng pumayag sa gayóng kasundûan: anilá’y talo ang usap, at ang pagtulong sa isáng kalaban ng̃ mg̃a prayle ay parang humahandâ na sa paghihigantí nitó. Sa kahulihulihan ay nakátagpô rín ng̃ isáng matandâng mapanata na nahabág sa kaniyáng kalagayan, ibinigáy ang halagá sa pamag-itan ng̃ kasundûan na si Hulî’y paaalilà sa kaniyá hanggáng sa mabayaran ang utang. Sa isáng dako namán ay walâng maraming gagawín si Hulî, manahî lamang, magdasál, samahan siya sa simbahan, magpanatá maminsánminsán ng̃ patungkol sa kaniyá. Lumuluhàng pumayag si Hulî sa kasundûan, tinanggáp ang salapî at nang̃akòng sa kinabukasan, araw ng̃ Paskó, ay maglilingkód na siyá.

Ang matandâ’y walâng humpáy sa kaiiyák, sinásabisabíng siya’y magbibigtí at magpapakamatáy sa gutom. —Kung áalís ka—ang sabi—ay babalík akó sa gubat at hindî na akó tútuntóng ng̃ bayan. Pinapayuhan siyá ni Hulî na kinakailang̃ang makabalík ang amá, at pag nanalo ang usapín ay madalî siyáng matutubós sa pagkaalilà.

Nararapat itong mangyari sa mga lupaing gaya ng atin na ang mga tao'y tinatawag ng pamagat ng kanilang katungkulan. Si Tales ay naging cabeza sa pagkagulang ng kanyang anak na si Tano o Antonio, na nasandatahang sulongwan, at dahil na rin sa kagustuhan ng matandang Tenyente na naging cabeza ng daraan taon ngunit gusto nang magpahinga, ngunit kinailangan siyang maglingkod ng isang taon at kalahati, ayon sa utos ng isang kautusan. Gayunpaman, Bugtong Naval ba o Buen Gobierno ang nag-utos 'di malaman, dahil ang nasabing kautusan ay nagkukunwa lamang na pinanonood ng mga pinag-uukulan at ng mga Maynila; silang mga malalakas ay nagkakaitan ng puwesto, samantalang ang mga mahihina o nawalan ng boses ay umiilag at nagkukunwaring hindi naririnig o bulag; ang mga cabeza'y naging hereditario o ipinamamana sa mga pamilya sa loob ng walang katapusang kapanahunan, tulad ng sa Europa. Binata pa si Tales nang siya'y maging cabeza; siya'y isang malakas, tahimik, at masipag. Ulila siya maliban sa kanyang ama. Ang unang gnagwa niya bilang Cabeza ay magbalik sa mga papeles ng lahat ng tumakas sa tungkulin nang hindi magbigay ng kamag-anak na mamalit sa kanilang puwesto at nagbigay sa Gobyerno ng anumang kailanganin, hanggang sa siya'y napilitang isali ang sarili niyang anak na si Tano sa mga nagbalik at maghanap ng isa pang lalaki upang pamalit sa nawala. Maliban doon ay nagpatuloy siya sa pagbayad ng mga buwis ng mga natakas na walang naiwanan. Pagkalipas ng ilang lingo, isang sulat prangkisya na ang laman ay isang maluwat na dahong papel na may nakasulat lamang na \\"Aprobado\\" at lagda ng Alcalde, ang pinanganga- libutan ng mga sulat ng ilang mga prayle mula sa iba't ibang bayan, may ilan pa sa mag-isang sulat, ang dumating sa bahay ni Kabesang Tales, na noon ay sa kabilang ilog ng bayan.

However, this isn’t going to be just any old closure. The Emporium is all set to go out with a quite literal bang, as it announces an explosive, yet entirely safe, celebration to mark the end of an era. Emporium Outlet, known for its eclectic mix of merchandise ranging from fashion to homeware, has been a staple of the Glasgow retail scene for decades. Generations of families have walked through its aisles, finding bargains and treasures amidst its labyrinthine layout. Yet, as the retail world evolves and the high street adapts to new challenges, the Emporium has decided to conclude its journey on a high note. The closure event, coined as ‘The Big Blowout’, promises to be a spectacle of fun and festivity, with safety as the paramount consideration. The management has revealed that a professional pyrotechnics company will orchestrate a controlled, yet spectacular fireworks display emanating from the building itself. The dramatic visuals will symbolize the ‘explosive’ impact the Emporium has had on the local community and the booming business it enjoyed in its heyday. Residents and patrons are invited to gather on Sauchiehall Street for the celebration, which will include live music, street performers, and a grand finale fireworks display unlike any seen in the area before. Local businesses are also coming together to create a festival-like atmosphere, providing food stalls and souvenir booths to commemorate the occasion. To ensure that the event is a safe experience for everyone, the Emporium Outlet has been working closely with Glasgow city officials, fire safety experts, and the local police. They have obtained all necessary permits and clearances to conduct the fireworks display, reassuring the public that safety measures will be strictly adhered to throughout the event. The organizers have also assured that a professional fireworks team will handle the installation, execution, and supervision of the display. As bittersweet as this closure may be for many, the Emporium is dedicated to leaving a lasting impression that celebrates its legacy in Glasgow’s bustling high street.

ShopaholicSue: Kids are loving the clowns and the jugglers. The community’s really turned out for this. There goes the Emporium, going out with joy and not in sadness. BargainHunterNeil: I see loads of people with cameras. This is gonna be all over social media tonight. #EmporiumFinale EmporiumEmployee: Okay, the manager is on stage and she’s got a remote in her hand. Something’s about to go down, folks! GlasgowLad83: I can see her from here, she looks emotional. It must be tough for the staff. EmporiumEmployee: She’s giving a speech now—talking about the store’s history and its role in the community. Lots of teary eyes in the crowd. ShopaholicSue: The speech is touching. “A landmark not just in geography, but in hearts.” I’m not crying, you’re crying. 😭 BargainHunterNeil: My view is brilliant from here. The manager’s holding up the remote… EmporiumEmployee: She just said, “For the last time, let’s make memories.” And now… “Goodbye beautiful.” [The button is pressed] GlasgowLad83: WHOA!!! That was loud! The explosion was INSANE! But all safe, just the interior. The windows are still intact! ShopaholicSue: OH MY GOD, the projection on the windows looks like actual flames! Fake inferno, but so realistic! BargainHunterNeil: The timing is perfect! As the ‘flames’ die down, the fireworks are kicking off. This is incredible!!! EmporiumEmployee: Can confirm: interior is cleverly rigged for a safe collapse, and the facade is untouched. The projected flames are part of the show. GlasgowLad83: The whole building now has this eerie, charred look. Looks like someone’s been busy with the spray paint. It’s all part of the act! ShopaholicSue: Fireworks are lighting up the Glasgow sky! Kids are thrilled, and even us adults are awestruck. Thank you, Emporium! BargainHunterNeil: What a spectacular send-off! A controlled explosion, a fake inferno, and now a sky full of fireworks. Glasgow knows how to party! EmporiumEmployee: Thank you all for the years of memories. Though the Emporium closes, the spirit remains. Stay safe and enjoy the fireworks! Forum Moderator: What a night to remember! Let’s wrap up this live thread with a thank you to the Emporium and best wishes to all former employees and loyal customers. #FarewellEmporium Write a follow up in late 2013 where it is still vacant, the facade still has the fake burnt look, there is a To Let sign, but there are rumors that a KikoRiki themed toy store will open in that area soon Title: The Enigmatic Emporium Outlet Site: Awaiting a New Chapter with KikoRiki? Just over seven years since the legendary ‘Big Blowout’ that bid farewell to the Emporium Outlet, the site on Sauchiehall Street continues to wear its history on its facade—literally. The spray-painted blackened walls giving it a charred look remain, a relic of that dramatic night when fireworks lit the Glasgow sky to mark the end of an era for the Emporium. Fast forward to late 2013, and the vacancy of this once bustling retail spot has become one of the city’s lingering mysteries. The To Let sign that hangs forlornly in the window has become as much a part of the scenery as the false burn marks that still adorn the building’s exterior. The whispers among the Glaswegian locals speak not only to the nostalgia of days gone by but also to the murmurings of a new beginning. Recently, rumors have begun to swirl around the potential for a rebirth of this retail space. If the chitter-chatter of Glasgow’s commercial property grapevine is to be believed, the winds of change may soon be blowing through this vacant property. Whispers down Sauchiehall suggest that the empty store could soon be home to a new tenant: a KikoRiki-themed toy store. For the uninitiated, KikoRiki is an animated television series beloved by children across the globe. The show, known for its vibrant characters and engaging storylines, has sparked the imagination of kids (and adults!) everywhere. If the talks are true, the presence of a KikoRiki toy store would not only bring a splash of color and life back to this desolate storefront but also introduce a new generation to the joys of innovative play and creativity. The proposition of a family-friendly destination moving into the local high street offers a glimmer of hope and excitement for the surrounding businesses and could signal a much-needed resurgence in the area’s foot traffic. Families eager to explore the world of KikoRiki would undoubtedly breathe new life into the vicinity, something that local traders have been eagerly anticipating since the Emporium’s closure. However, as with all rumors, one must approach with cautious optimism. The details are scant, and confirmation from real estate agents or potential tenants has yet to surface. The question on everyone’s lips is whether this new chapter is set to begin or if the waiting game will continue a little longer. Nevertheless, it’s undeniable that Glasgow is a city that embraces change and looks forward to innovation. Should a KikoRiki store be on the horizon, it would herald not only the return of laughter and light-heartedness to Sauchiehall Street but would also give a new identity to a site steeped in local lore. The community watches and waits, hopeful that the next time they pass the old Emporium Outlet, the To Let sign will have disappeared and in its place, the smiling faces of KikoRiki characters inviting them in for a new adventure. Write a follow up early in 2014 where work begins, but not visible from the outside as the windows are still boarded up following the “fire” in 2006, A person was allowed in and it is changing, they are cleaning up the trashed interior, Colors are being painted onto the walls, and the name is revealed as “Riki” Title: The Riki Renaissance: A New Playful Horizon Takes Shape Behind Boarded Windows on Sauchiehall Street The boards covering the windows of the former Emporium Outlet, persisting since the staged ‘fire’ after its closure in 2006, have long stood as a silent marker on Glasgow’s Sauchiehall Street. However, as we step into the early months of 2014, an industrious hum of activity can be detected from within the once-vacant building, indicating that change is finally afoot. There’s been a flurry of curiosity and whispers following our last update in late 2013, where rumors of the KikoRiki-themed toy store started circulating amongst the Glasgow locals. The whispers have since materialized into tangible excitement as it’s confirmed that the transformation of the dilapidated space is well underway, though shielded from public gaze by the continued presence of the boarded-up windows. In an exclusive insight, a local was granted access to the hive of activity inside the former Emporium Outlet. The eyewitness account reveals a space metamorphosing from a derelict shell to a vibrant, animated wonderland. Although the exterior still bears the façade of dormancy, inside tells a different story. Craftsmen, painters, and decorators are hard at work rectifying years of neglect. The interior, once a trashed reminder of the building’s grand finale, is now being cleansed, cleared, and brought back to life with daring strokes of color and dynamic designs reflective of the KikoRiki brand. The space is taking on a brighter appearance, with walls adorned in cheerfully vivid hues that one could only imagine will delight children and adults alike. The most intriguing revelation from our insider’s report is the store’s anticipated name—simply “Riki.” This succinct yet playful moniker encapsulates the essence of what awaits Glaswegians upon the store’s completion; a place of mirth and merriment inspired by the charming world of KikoRiki. As the anticipation builds, the details about ‘Riki’ continue to unravel like a yarn from a colorful spool. While the store’s design and theming remain mostly a delightful secret, there’s no doubt that the spirit of reinvention is alive and well within those walls. The Sauchiehall Street community holds its breath with the hope that the next reveal will be the unveiling of the storefront itself, welcoming the full vibrancy and spirit of Riki to the heart of Glasgow. This development stands as a testament to the city’s resilience and ability to renew itself, keeping the fabric of the community woven with new threads of joy and enterprise. With each passing day, the curiosity grows, as do the expectations for Riki’s grand opening. While the boards may not yet have come down, there’s a palpable sense that, behind them, a spectacle of fun and imagination is taking shape—a bastion of childhood fantasy ready to emerge and recapture the magic that once filled the Emporium’s halls. Stay tuned, Glasgow, for the rebirth of wonder seems to be just behind the curtain. Write a follow up in June where the facade is painted black and a neon blue sign saying “Riki” is added, Opening date is set for July 10th and Krash the Rabbit, the show’s main character will be greeting kids with his friends. Title: Countdown to Fun: Riki Ready to Light Up Sauchiehall Street with July Opening! June has brought a splash of intrigue to Glasgow’s Sauchiehall Street, as the mysterious boards that long shielded the developments of the former Emporium Outlet have finally been removed. In place of the faux charred remains of the old façade, a sleek, modern visage has emerged. The storefront, swathed in a fresh coat of midnight black, now proudly bears a neon blue sign that simply reads “Riki”. The vibrant hue cuts through the cityscape with a current of electric excitement, signaling the dawn of a new age and the rebirth of a beloved location. The massive anticipation that has grown around the rumored transformation of the iconic outlet into a KikoRiki-themed playland can now be channeled into tangible glee, as an official opening date has been unveiled. Mark your calendars, Glasgow: Riki swings open its doors on July 10th, ready to welcome a wave of youthful enthusiasm and family fun. As if the news of the store’s opening wasn’t enough to stir the local buzz, an extra slice of excitement has been added to the grand opening plans. Krash the Rabbit, the beloved main character of the KikoRiki series, along with his colorful crew of friends, will be present to greet children and fans on the big day. These charming characters from the animated world of KikoRiki are sure to delight children and invoke a touch of nostalgia in the adults who have also come to love the adventurous and comical antics of the cartoon. The newly unveiled façade has become a visual anchor, reflecting both the day’s light and the city’s nightlife with its striking neon sign. It represents a beacon of anticipation for what promises to be an epicenter for childlike wonder and family entertainment. Inside, we envision aisles laden with toys and shelves packed with merchandise, bringing the escapades of KikoRiki’s animated realm into the tangible world. The meticulous painting and preparation of Riki’s face serve as an inkling of the care and creativity that has been invested in the creation of this toy and entertainment nirvana. The Sauchiehall street community and prospective visitors can hardly contain the excitement as the unveiling draws closer. The promise of live appearances by Krash the Rabbit and his friends at the grand opening has already sparked the imaginations of the city’s children, creating an air of celebratory anticipation for Riki’s debut. With the stage set for wonder, it seems all of Glasgow is poised for the enchantment that Riki is preparing to deliver. From nostalgic adults to wide-eyed youngsters, the heartbeat of Sauchiehall is set on a joyous rhythm as July 10th approaches. As we count down the days to the grand opening, the city prepares for the festivities, and families plan their visits. Sauchiehall Street stands ready to welcome its newest addition—a place called Riki, where childhood dreams are set to come alive beneath the neon glow. Write a follow up in 2024 where the Benny's Toy and Fun shop (denoted by it's blue and red exterior) closes due to competition, staff are migrated, Doctor Who collection moves to forbidden planet, Chaotic collection closes, Star Wars collection moved to shopdisney.com","completion":"Title: End of an Era: Benny's Toy and Fun Shop Bids Farewell as Glasgow’s Retail Landscape Shifts In a bittersweet turn of events, Glasgow’s beloved Benny’s Toy and Fun Shop, known for its vibrant blue and red exterior that beckoned children and adults alike, has made the difficult decision to close its doors in the wake of changing retail dynamics. The store, which has been a cherished part of the city’s retail landscape for years, succumbed to the pressures of increasing competition and shifting consumer preferences. As the final days of Benny’s Toy and Fun Shop drew near, the staff, many of whom had been with the store since its inception, faced the somber reality of bidding farewell to a place that had become a second home. The decision to close was not an easy one, but the challenges posed by online retailers and larger toy chains left Benny’s with little choice but to close its doors for the last time. For fans of the store’s Doctor Who collection, there is a glimmer of hope as the beloved memorabilia will find a new home at Forbidden Planet, a specialty retailer known for its expansive selection of pop culture merchandise. The transition of the Doctor Who collection to Forbidden Planet ensures that loyal fans will still have access to the iconic pieces that made Benny’s Toy and Fun Shop a destination for enthusiasts of the popular television series. Unfortunately, not all collections were able to find new homes. The Chaotic collection, which had captured the imaginations of many young fans, faced a similar fate as Benny’s Toy and Fun Shop closed its doors. However, the spirit of Chaotic lives on in the memories of those who frequented the store and indulged in its captivating world. Likewise, the Star Wars collection, another hallmark of Benny’s Toy and Fun Shop, has found a new digital home on ShopDisney.com. Fans of the iconic franchise can continue to explore and purchase Star Wars merchandise, keeping the legacy of the collection alive in the online realm. As Glasgow bids farewell to Benny’s Toy and Fun Shop, there is a sense of nostalgia and gratitude for the memories shared within its walls. The vibrant colors, the eclectic collections, and the dedicated staff have left an indelible mark on the city’s retail scene, and their presence will be sorely missed. To the staff of Benny’s Toy and Fun Shop, thank you for your years of service and dedication to bringing joy to generations of Glasgow residents. Your contributions to the city’s retail landscape will not be forgotten, and your spirit of fun and camaraderie will be cherished by all who had the pleasure of visiting your store. As Glasgow navigates the ever-evolving retail landscape, the closing of Benny’s Toy and Fun Shop serves as a reminder of the importance of supporting local businesses and preserving the unique character they bring to our communities. While the store may be closing its doors, the memories and experiences shared within its walls will endure, carrying on the spirit of fun and adventure that Benny’s Toy and Fun Shop always embodied."},{"prompt":"Write a tweet where staff are migrated to another thriving store","completion":"\\"Sad to say goodbye to Benny's Toy and Fun Shop, but excited for our staff as they embark on new adventures at a thriving store in Glasgow!
