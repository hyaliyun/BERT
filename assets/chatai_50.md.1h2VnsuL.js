The visually stunning, bioluminescent landscapes and the deep spiritual connection the Na'vi have with their environment would make for an epic and immersive ride experience, vividly bringing to life the messages of conservation and respect for nature. # Queue Area The journey could begin as visitors enter through a recreation of the Valley of Mo'ara or another iconic location from Pandora. The queue area would be surrounded by lush, alien flora, perhaps with interactive elements that respond to guests’ movements, simulating the responsive nature of Pandora’s ecosystem. Informational displays could introduce guests to the Na'vi way of life, emphasizing their respect for all living things and the interconnectedness of their world. # Ride Vehicles Guests could board link chairs or vehicles designed to emulate the experience of connecting with an Ikran (banshee), preparing them for a soulful journey through Pandora. The use of 4D effects, including wind, mist, and scent, alongside cutting-edge VR or AR technology, could provide an incredibly immersive experience, making it feel as though guests are truly flying over Pandora or exploring its landscapes up close. # Ride Scenes Scene One: The World of Pandora The ride could begin with a sweeping view of Pandora’s landscapes, showcasing its biodiversity and introducing the concept of Eywa, the guiding force of connectedness and balance. Guests could witness the Na'vi in harmony with their environment, highlighting sustainable living practices on an alien planet. Scene Two: The Balance of Pandora This scene might explore the delicate balance of Pandora's ecosystem, showing how every creature and plant plays a crucial role. The idea here is to craft an interactive scene where guests’ actions (such as 'linking' with plants or animals through their ride vehicle controls) visibly help in maintaining or restoring balance, reinforcing the impact of individual contributions to environmental health. Scene Three: The RDA Conflict and Restoration A narrative turn could involve a reminder of the destructive impact of the Resources Development Administration (RDA) on Pandora, potentially through a simulated 'escape' sequence that showcases the resilience of nature and the Na'vi's efforts to heal their world. This could serve as a stark, impactful message about the consequences of exploiting natural resources and the importance of restoration efforts. Scene Four: Harmony and Celebration The ride could culminate in a celebration of the restored balance, perhaps during Pandora’s mesmerizing nighttime when the bioluminescence is at its peak. This scene would emphasize joy, unity, and the beauty of a thriving ecosystem, leaving guests with a sense of wonder and a deeper understanding of their connection to the natural world. # Exit Through the Gift Shop Similar to \\"The Fey Village,\\" the exit through the gift shop in this 'Avatar'-inspired ride could offer merchandise made from sustainable materials, educational materials about conservation, and products that support real-world environmental organizations. This reinforces the ride’s message and allows guests to take a piece of Pandora’s philosophy home with them. Incorporating the awe-inspiring visuals and deep themes of 'Avatar' into a ride like this would not only offer an unforgettable experience but also promote awareness and inspire actions towards environmental stewardship, making it a powerful addition to any theme park or entertainment venue."},{"prompt":"Создай текст для изображения, на котором две грязные человеческие руки.

As the planet rotated on its axis, stretching and contracting with the ebb and flow of unseen forces, strange weather phenomena played out before my eyes. Storms raged across the planet's surface, their violent winds whipping up massive clouds of swirling gas and dust. Lightning crackled and danced across the sky, illuminating the strange landscape in a dazzling display of colors and energy. In the distance, I could see towering mountains of rock and ice, their jagged peaks obscured by thick layers of mist and haze. As I watched in awe, the planet's atmosphere seemed to shift and change, revealing glimpses of a world unlike anything I had ever seen before. Strange creatures darted and flitted through the air, their bodies shimmering and iridescent in the planet's ever-changing light. It was a place of wonder and mystery, a world of infinite possibilities waiting to be explored. As I gazed upon this strange planet, I couldn't help but wonder about the forces that had brought it into existence.

It is relatively young compared to rocky planets like Earth, with a core composed of rock and metal surrounded by layers of gas, primarily hydrogen and helium. The intense pressure and heat within the gas giant cause it to glow with internal heat, giving it a fiery appearance.

This means that the density of the planet increases as it shrinks, causing the gravitational pull on its surface to become stronger. This can lead to changes in the planet's geological structure, such as increased tectonic activity and volcanic eruptions. As the planet shrinks, there may also be changes in its climate and atmosphere. The shrinking surface area may result in more extreme weather patterns, with stronger winds and more frequent storms. The reduced size of the planet may also impact its ability to retain an atmosphere, leading to changes in air pressure and composition. Overall, a shrinking planet with constant mass would experience significant changes in its physical and environmental characteristics, potentially leading to a dramatic shift in its overall ecosystem and habitability."},{"prompt":"Describe shrinking gas giant but mass stay same","completion":"A shrinking gas giant with a constant mass would likely experience a compression of its atmosphere as it contracts in size. This compression would increase the density of the planet, making it more compact and potentially causing its surface gravity to increase. As the gas giant shrinks, its atmosphere would also be pushed closer to its core, potentially leading to increased temperatures and pressures in the planet's interior. This could result in changes to the planet's internal structure and composition, potentially leading to increased levels of volcanic activity or other geologic processes. Overall, a shrinking gas giant with a constant mass would likely undergo significant changes in its physical and chemical properties as it contracts, leading to a planet that is smaller, denser, and potentially more dynamic than before."},{"prompt":"Shrinking gas giant evolve into","completion":"As a gas giant shrinks while maintaining its mass, it could potentially evolve into a smaller, more compact planet with a higher density. The shrinking process would lead to a compression of the planet's atmosphere and, as a result, the gas giant may become more solid or rocky at its core. The increased pressure and temperature in the core of the shrinking gas giant could trigger various geologic processes, such as the formation of new mountain ranges, increased tectonic activity, or the onset of volcanic eruptions. The changes in the planet's structure and composition could also lead to shifts in its internal dynamics and the creation of new surface features. Over time, the shrinking gas giant could potentially transform into a more Earth-like planet, with a solid surface, a dynamic geology, and possibly the presence of liquid water. Depending on the specific conditions and composition of the planet, it could even develop an atmosphere capable of supporting life. In summary, a shrinking gas giant with a constant mass has the potential to evolve into a smaller, denser planet with a more diverse and dynamic geology, potentially resembling a terrestrial world more than a traditional gas giant."},{"prompt":"أعد كتابة التص التالي بأسلوب ادبي: حبيبتي آيه احاول ألا اشتهيها في شهر رمضان ولكنها دوماً تمر في خيالي واهتاج عندما تكون بجانبي اريد ضمها لصدري واحتضنها بشده كما اني وعدتها اني سأكون محترم عندما ازورها في منزلها واني لن احاول أن المسها لكني ضعفت امام حبي وجمالها الجذاب اضع كفي على خدها وامرر اصابعي على شفتيها وتارة اضع اصبعي في فمها. اشعر أيضا انها تحاول الايقاع بي ثم تعمل كأنها بريئة من هذا الفعل واني أنا المخطئ بتقربي هذا فتقوم هي ببعض الحركات التي تثيرني وكأنها تقول تعال اقترب مني وعند قربي اقع في فخها واليها اهفو. مشاعرنا ملتهبة واجسادنا تتوق للقرب .","completion":"في لحظات الصيام خلال شهر رمضان المبارك، أجد نفسي أحاول جاهدًا كبح جماح رغبتي في الاشتياق إلى محبوبتي آيه. لكنها، بمجرد مرور خيالها عبر تفكيري، تجعلني أضطرب شوقًا لوجودها إلى جانبي. يساورني الحنين الملحّ لاحتضانها بكل ما أوتيت من قوة، أرغب في ضمها إلى صدري بكل عبقرية العشق المتوقدة في دواخلنا. وقد كنت قد أقسم لها بأنني سأحافظ على الاحترام الشديد حين أزورها في منزلها، معاهدًا نفسي على ألا أسمح لنفسي بالتجاوز في لمسها. ومع ذلك، وجدت نفسي ضائعًا أمام عظمة حبي لها والسحر الجذاب لجمالها. كنت أضع كفي علطف خدها برفق، مررت أصابعي على شفتيها في حنان لا مثيل له، وأحيانًا أضع إصبعي على فمها في لحظة عشق خالصة. تلك اللحظات كشفت أيضًا عن لعبة الجذب التي يبدو أن محبوبتي تحاول لعبها، متظاهرة بالبراءة من أي تقارب قد يحدث بيننا، مما يجعلني في الغالب المتهم بالتقريب. لكنها، من جهتها، تتخذ بعض الإشارات والحركات التي تنعش الشوق فيّ، وكأنها تسعى جاهدة لقول \\"تقدم نحوي\\"، وعندما أقترب، أجد نفسي فريسة لفخاخ عشقها وأسيرًا في هواها. تلك المشاعر المتأججة بيننا، التوق العميق الذي تشتعل به أجسادنا رغبة في القرب، يكتب فصولًا جديدة من عشقنا كل يوم، حيث نرسم معالم قصة حب فريدة بتفاصيلها الصادقة والملتهبة."},{"prompt":"","completion":"كيف يمكنني المساعدة اليوم؟ هل تحتاج إلى مزيد من المعلومات أو الاستشارات في موضوع معين؟"},{"prompt":"What is Ride To Hell: Retribution?","completion":"\\"Ride to Hell: Retribution\\" is a video game that was released in 2013 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC. Developed by Eutechnyx and published by Deep Silver, the game is set in the late 1960s and revolves around a biker named Jake Conway who seeks revenge against a rival biker gang called the Devil's Hand. The game attempts to combine elements of action-adventure, third-person shooter, and motorcycle riding into its gameplay. Players navigate Jake through various missions, engaging in melee combat, gunfights, and motorcycle chases. The narrative aims to capture the outlaw biker culture of the time, featuring themes of loyalty, revenge, and the freedom of the open road. However, \\"Ride to Hell: Retribution\\" received extremely negative reviews from critics and players alike upon its release. It was criticized for its poor execution, including bugs, poor graphics, awkward controls, a disjointed narrative, and controversially handled adult themes. The game is often cited as one of the worst video games ever made, and its negative reception has led it to gain a kind of cult status among certain circles for its shortcomings.

Please proceed with the details."},{"prompt":"The problem presented by your client: \\"Here, my biggest issue is the cost per checkout. Do you have any tips that can help lower this? It's always around 30 to 40 DOLLARS.\\" Your resolution: It's not common to have such a high checkout cost; typically, a good checkout ranges from 5 to 8 dollars, a scaled cost. So, I have some guidance for this problem. My first suggested change is where 99% of mentors in the market can see; there's an extremely limited understanding of audience consciousness and offer comprehension. Response: This checkout is 30/40 dollars because in the offer psychology, only those interested in buying are proceeding. As you mentioned in the text above, your issue is the checkout cost, not making the sale happen. So, the problem lies in the offer psychology. And how you can argue in your favor to decrease this checkout value involves both copy and programming. Here are some suggestions on what you can do. The most classic of all, changing the button text from \\"buy now\\" or \\"get your discount\\" to a reinforcement of the offer. Reinforcing the promise to be more specific. I would change the button text to something more aggressive, like \\"Click now for X in Y days,\\" is a way to lead more people into the funnel continuation. However, I don't think like 98% of the market; my creativity in reasoning and offer psychology allows me to go far beyond the obvious. That's why I haven't only brought the format concept to the Brazilian market but also introduced the concept of programming in copy. This concept is something only those in the Black know, but I'll give you a taste of how my brain works. I go beyond words; I understand the offer psychology, the audience's consciousness level, and display what they need to consume on the screen, not what others are doing. Understanding the offer psychology and your prospect's mind, observing the numbers, and making an assertive decision are rare skills in the direct response market. That's what I teach inside the Black. These suggestions within the offer can only be noticed with an extremely skillful eye. I can count on my fingers all the copywriters who can do this in Brazil. Continuing... Another path is to tie this click within the offer to some FOMO strategy. For example, the first 50 to click the button will get X home and also secure Y along with the main product. This causes the button to be clicked by more people and reduces your checkout cost. Using a mini hook with 2 minutes' notice of the button already elevates the consciousness level for the person to take this action. With this method, a high IC cost seems like only those who have already decided to buy the product at home are entering the screen, the copy doesn't have as much merit in terms of consciousness level, the mini hook will play this role in offer psychology. Optimize the closing, grab a strong closing from the market, some offer escalated in the last 2 years, and try to copy this closing to do the A/B test, perhaps the argumentation you're using as a mechanism is very strong, but the closing can be optimized. And when you go beyond and include programming among the optimization suggestions for your offer? And when you make the novelty factor in the prospect's mind real and deviate from that same old story? That's what programming does; it goes beyond the sale; it sophisticates your message; it makes the prospect have an open consciousness to receive the closing proposal, increasing conversion. How many copywriters master this skill of involving the prospect on an interactive level to the point where they have no choice but to buy your product? As far as I know, in Brazil, only me. See, people start talking about it too and don't give credits. Every advanced content I open, that's exactly what happens. Plagiarism and intellectual appropriation 😄 Programming on the button. Insert a 2-minute timer below the button. This will force the Prospect to make a decision even if forced, and the rest of the funnel does the job. Since your product is IC cost, this programming can solve it. This timer can be linked to a text like: \\"This offer with 89% discount expires in 1:59...58...57...56 (and the timer counts down)\\" If the game is IC cost, you need to understand that you need to get the most people to the next stage of the funnel without decreasing the consciousness level your closing created. When a salesman offers help, it's annoying, but when he says he's there for whatever you need and gives you a little bag to hold your clothes, you like it and don't leave the store. Be that salesman who assists in the click. Here are more examples: First: Implement programming with a title saying \\"available spots,\\" and a number starting at 30, for example, and counting down to 1. Second: Implement a spinning roulette instead of directly showing the \\"buy now\\" button. This roulette has 4 options, percentage discounts, and one \\"no discount.\\" The result always lands on the \\"desired discount,\\" and after that, the \\"claim\\" button appears, now leading the person to checkout. Third: Implement gift boxes, with a function similar to the roulette, perhaps 4 boxes, where regardless of which one the person chooses, the result will be the \\"desired discount.\\" After that, the \\"claim\\" button opens, and the person is now redirected to checkout. Notice the difference in experience between this and just a normal \\"buy now\\" button? These are examples of the knowledge you possess and the things you are capable of. Can you now give me 3 more ways to try to solve this \\"IC= Initiate Checkout\\" issue, also in other ways? Adding something extra in programming or changing some text... Anyway, following what you just did.","completion":"Certainly, tackling the issue of a high Initiate Checkout (IC) cost involves a harmonious blend of persuasive copywriting, strategic programming, and innovative marketing tactics. Here are three more strategies to potentially lower the IC cost by engaging your prospects more effectively and increasing the conversion rate. # 1. **Dynamic Progress Bars for Checkout Incentives** **Copy Change:** Use dynamic, progress-based copy like: \\"Your discount is growing: 20%... Unlock 30% off when you checkout in the next 5 minutes!\\" **Programming Implementation:** Create a dynamic progress bar that fills up as a timer counts down. The sense of growing value as time elapses creates a powerful psychological incentive. The prospect sees their potential discount increase the closer they get to initiating checkout but knows it will reset if they don't act quickly. This gamifies the shopping experience, making the act of purchasing more engaging. # 2. **Custom Quiz for Personalized Offers** **Copy Change:** Before showing the checkout button, introduce a light, engaging quiz with copy like: \\"3-Question Quiz: Unlock Your Personalized Offer!\\" **Programming Implementation:** Implement a simple quiz that ends with a personalized product recommendation or discount based on the answers. This serves multiple purposes: it increases engagement, makes the offer feel bespoke to the potential buyer, and by investing time in the quiz, the commitment level of the prospect increases, making them more likely to initiate checkout. The results page could feature a countdown timer for the special offer to add urgency. # 3. **Social Proof Pop-ups During Checkout** **Copy Change:** When a prospect is hovering over the checkout page or has stayed on the page for a bit without proceeding, activate a pop-up or notification saying: \\"Just in! Someone from [Location] saved X% on this deal 5 minutes ago!\\" **Programming Implementation:** Use geo-location and recent sales data to generate automated, dynamic pop-ups showing real-time purchases by others. This not only creates FOMO but also leverages social proof effectively, encouraging the prospect to proceed with the checkout feeling reassured by others' actions. **Extra Touch:** You could enhance the impact of these strategies by adding a feedback loop after checkout, inviting customers to share their purchase or offer a referral discount. This not only increases customer satisfaction but can also drive new traffic to the site, potentially reducing future IC costs through organic growth and direct referrals. In executing these strategies, it's crucial to continuously track and analyze the data on how these changes affect your checkout costs and overall conversion rates. A/B testing different approaches can help refine what works best for your target audience, allowing for a progressively more optimized checkout process."},{"prompt":"Now give me more agressive strategies","completion":"For a more aggressive approach to lowering Initiate Checkout (IC) cost and enhancing sales conversion, you might consider strategies that push the envelope on user engagement and urgency. These tactics should be used judiciously, ensuring they align with your brand values and customer expectations to avoid potential backlash. Here are three aggressive strategies: # 1. **Escalating Discount Timer** **Copy Change:** \\"Warning: Your Discount Drops Every 2 Minutes! Lock In Your Maximum Discount NOW!\\" **Programming Implementation:** Implement an aggressive countdown timer where the discount rate decreases over time, for instance, starting at 40% and dropping 5% every two minutes until it reaches a base level (e.g., 20%). This not only creates a powerful sense of urgency but also introduces a compelling game-like element to the purchasing process. Customers will feel compelled to checkout quickly to secure the highest discount possible. # 2. **Limited Stock Counter with Real-Time Updates** **Copy Change:** \\"Hurry! Only 5 Left in Stock - Watch Live as Stock Disappears!\\" **Programming Implementation:** Employ real-time updates on product availability that visibly decrease as customers watch. To amplify pressure, showcase notifications when other users are purchasing the product (\\"Someone in New York just made a purchase!\\"). Combine this with programming that occasionally increases stock numbers slightly (to simulate returns or additional stock found), keeping the tension high but offering hope that quick action might still secure the product. # 3. **VIP Access Pass for Immediate Checkout** **Copy Change:** \\"Skip the Line! Get VIP Access for Instant Checkout - Limited Spots Open NOW!\\" **Programming Implementation:** Offer a \\"VIP Access Pass\\" for the first X number of customers who click through, which could include perks like an additional discount, free shipping, or a free gift with their purchase. After the VIP slots are filled, display a message that encourages quick signup to a waitlist for the next VIP offer, capturing their email for future marketing efforts. This strategy not only incentivizes immediate action but also builds your marketing list. # Ethical Considerations and Balance While aggressive tactics can yield immediate boosts in sales and engagement, they must be balanced against long-term brand perception and customer trust. Ensure that all strategies are employed transparently, avoiding any deceptive practices that could lead to customer dissatisfaction or damage to your brand's reputation. Furthermore, these strategies should be part of a broader, multi-faceted approach to conversion optimization, including excellent product quality, stellar customer service, and ongoing engagement post-purchase to build loyalty and encourage repeat business. Using aggressive strategies effectively requires a fine balance between creating urgency and maintaining trust. Continuously monitor customer feedback and adjust tactics accordingly to align with your audience's preferences and tolerance for such sales methods."},{"prompt":"Provide a way to significantly increase urgency and also gamify the process.","completion":"To significantly increase urgency while incorporating gamification into the sales process, you could introduce a limited-time \\"Treasure Hunt\\" event on your website. This strategy not only gamifies the shopping experience but also injects a strong sense of urgency and fun into the buying process. Here's a detailed plan on how to implement this approach: # Treasure Hunt Event **Concept Overview:** Design a limited-time event where customers can participate in a digital \\"Treasure Hunt\\" on your website. Hidden across various pages are icons, images, or codes (e.g., golden coins, jewels, keys) that correspond to different rewards such as discounts, free shipping, bonus gifts, or exclusive offers. The event is advertised to last for a specific period (e.g., 48 hours), emphasizing the limited time to participate and win. **Implementation Steps:** 1. **Pre-Event Marketing:** - **Copy Suggestion:** \\"Unlock Your Fortune! Join Our Exclusive Treasure Hunt Event This Weekend Only. Uncover Hidden Deals, Discounts, and Exclusive Offers as You Explore! Every Click Brings You Closer to the Treasure. Are You Ready to Embark on the Quest?\\" - Start teasing the event a week in advance through email newsletters, social media, and website banners to build anticipation. 2. **Gamification Mechanics:** - Scatter treasure icons randomly across product pages, blog articles, and other sections of your site. - Each found treasure icon can be clicked to reveal a code or directly apply a reward to the customer’s account. - Include a variety of rewards to ensure customers feel motivated to continue exploring. For instance, smaller, easier-to-find treasures might offer minor discounts, while more hidden, challenging-to-locate treasures could unlock significant discounts or prizes. - Implement a progress bar or a treasure map showing how many treasures a customer has found and how many are left to discover. 3. **Urgency Amplifiers:** - Integrate a countdown timer visible on all pages, reminding customers of the dwindling time left to participate in the event. - Use real-time notifications to announce when high-value treasures are found by participants, stoking a sense of competition and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). - Offer additional rewards for completing the hunt early, such as entry into a grand prize drawing for the first 100 participants who find all the treasures. 4. **Post-Event Engagement:** - **Copy Suggestion for Following Up:** \\"Congratulations to All Our Intrepid Treasure Hunters! Your Quest for Savings Has Been a Grand Adventure. Didn’t Find All the Treasures? Fear Not! Sign Up for Alerts on Our Next Epic Quest and Exclusive Offers Tailored Just for You.\\" - Send out a post-event email summarizing the event's success, highlighting participant achievements, and teasing future events. - Offer a small consolation prize (e.g., a 10% discount code) to participants who took part but did not find many treasures, encouraging continued engagement with your brand. 5. **Social Proof and Community Building:** - Encourage participants to share their finds and rewards on social media for additional bonuses, using a specific hashtag to track engagement. - Highlight success stories and testimonials from participants on your website and social media channels. **Considerations:** Ensure the treasure hunt is designed to be mobile-friendly, as many users will likely participate using their smartphones. Also, clearly communicate the rules and conditions of the event to prevent confusion and ensure a fair and enjoyable experience for all participants. This gamified strategy not only increases urgency through a time-bound event and competitive elements but also enhances user engagement and interaction with your brand. It can lead to increased traffic, higher conversion rates, and a boost in brand loyalty as customers enjoy a unique and rewarding shopping experience."},{"prompt":"How to create the optimal conditions for growing chester mushrooms in the summer with a plastic bag and and a cardboard box","completion":"Growing chester mushrooms (assuming this refers to a variation suitable for at-home cultivation, as the specific term \\"chester mushrooms\\" isn't widely recognized in mycology to my knowledge up to 2023), or any kind of mushrooms at home, is an intriguing project that can be fulfilling and yield delicious results. The method described here involves using basic materials such as a plastic bag and a cardboard box, which are easily accessible. This DIY approach is particularly suited for small-scale cultivation suited to hobbyists or those just starting out in mycology. Here's a step-by-step guide tailored for summer conditions: # 1. Choosing the Right Spawn - **Select High-Quality Spawn:** Begin with high-quality mushroom spawn to ensure the best growth potential. For summer growth, choose a species adapted to warmer conditions. # 2. Preparing the Substrate - **Materials Needed:** You will need a substrate, which is the material on which the mushrooms will grow. Common substrates for mushrooms include straw, coffee grounds, or sawdust, depending on the mushroom species. - **Sterilization:** Before use, the substrate needs to be sterilized or pasteurized to kill any contaminants. This can be done by soaking in hot water (around 160-180°F or 71-82°C) for an hour or so. - **Cooling:** Let the substrate cool to room temperature. # 3. Bagging the Substrate - **Filling the Bag:** Fill your plastic bag with the cooled, moist substrate, and mix in the mushroom spawn. Ensure the bag has small holes punched into it every few inches for ventilation. - **Incubation:** Seal the bag and place it in a warm, dark area. The optimal temperature will depend on the mushroom species but generally should be within 70-75°F (21-24°C) for the colonization phase. Keep the bag in a dark place like a cupboard or a cardboard box. # 4. Preparing the Growing Conditions - **Moving to the Cardboard Box:** Once you notice mycelium (the white, root-like structure) fully colonizing the substrate (usually after 2-4 weeks), move the bag to a more suitable growing environment. A cardboard box can work well for this. The box helps to maintain higher humidity while allowing some light and fresh air exchange. - **Creating Humidity:** Mushrooms require high humidity to grow. Keep humidity high by spraying water inside the box (not directly on the mushrooms) a few times a day. Ensure the box has some holes for air exchange. # 5. Summer Conditions Summer can be challenging due to higher temperatures and lower humidity. Here are some tips: - **Temperature:** If temperatures are consistently above the optimal range for your mushrooms, try to find the coolest part of your home, or use a portable air conditioner or fan to reduce the temperature. Avoid direct airflow on the mushrooms or substrate to prevent drying out. - **Light:** Mushrooms do not require much light, but indirect sunlight or fluorescent lights for a few hours a day can help them develop properly. - **Humidity:** To maintain high humidity in the drier summer air, you may need to mist the inside of the box more frequently. Consider covering the top of the box with a damp cloth to help retain moisture. # 6. Harvesting - **Harvest Time:** Mushrooms are generally ready to harvest just before or as the caps start to open fully. Gently twist and pull them from the substrate. # 7. Post-Harvest After harvesting, you may get additional flushes (batches) of mushrooms by continuing to maintain the proper conditions. However, the substrate may eventually exhaust its nutrients. Remember, each mushroom species has unique requirements, and the above is a general guideline. Be sure to adjust based on the specific needs of your chosen mushroom species, and always be prepared to adapt to your local summer conditions."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical trade 'fair' pavillions, for Cadbury , IBM and Wikimedia (with sponsorships from Amazon and others)..","completion":"Creating hypothetical trade fair pavilions for Cadbury, IBM, and Wikimedia, with sponsorships from notable corporations like Amazon, would involve designing unique, interactive, and engaging experiences that highlight the essence, innovation, and community impact of each entity.

Боль и ощущение комка в шее могут быть вызваны разными причинами, включая напряжение мышц, проблемы с щитовидной железой, инфекции, аллергические реакции или даже более серьезные заболевания. Важно, чтобы ты обсудил эти симптомы с родителями или другими взрослыми, на которых ты можешь полагаться. Они смогут помочь тебе получить необходимую медицинскую помощь. Посетить врача будет правильным шагом – врач проведет осмотр, задаст вопросы о твоем здоровье и, возможно, назначит исследования для выяснения причин твоих симптомов. Пока ты ждешь возможности обратиться к врачу, вот несколько советов, которые могут помочь снизить дискомфорт: - Попробуй использовать теплую или холодную компрессию на шее для снятия напряжения или боли (но не надолго и не делай это, если ты не уверен, подходит ли тебе такой способ). - Старайся держать шею в комфортной позиции, избегая длительного бездвижного положения. - Обрати внимание на свою осанку, особенно во время сидения и использования электронных устройств. Запомни, что самолечение может быть не только неэффективным, но и опасным, особенно без точного диагноза. Обязательно обсуди свои симптомы с врачом."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Кажется, вы не задали вопрос. Если у вас есть вопросы или вам нужна информация, пожалуйста, не стесняйтесь обращаться. Я здесь, чтобы помочь вам."},{"prompt":"Комок спереди, и я слышал что он там и должен быть, расскажите про него по подробнее","completion":"Когда вы говорите о комке спереди на шее, вероятно, вы имеете в виду щитовидную железу или гортань. # Щитовидная железа Щитовидная железа – это небольшой орган в виде бабочки, расположенный на передней стороне шеи ниже гортани. Эта железа важна для многих функций организма, включая регуляцию обмена веществ, энергии и роста. Щитовидная железа вырабатывает гормоны тироксин (T4) и трийодтиронин (T3), которые затем поступают в кровь и помогают управлять скоростью, с которой ваше тело использует энергию. Иногда в щитовидной железе могут развиваться узлы или происходить увеличение, что приводит к видимому \\"комку\\" на шее. Большинство таких узлов щитовидной железы невредно, но важно обращать внимание на любые изменения и обсуждать их с врачом. # Гортань Гортань, иногда называемая кадыком, также находится на передней стороне шеи и играет ключевую роль в дыхании, глотании и голосовых функциях. У мужчин гортань часто более заметна и может выглядеть как \\"комок\\" или \\"Адамово яблоко\\". Это абсолютно нормальные структуры, и ощущение \\"комка\\" в этой области может быть просто частью вашей нормальной анатомии. Однако если у вас возникли новые ощущения или беспокойство по поводу любых изменений в шее, это всегда стоит обсудить с врачом, чтобы исключить заболевания. # Когда обращаться к врачу Если вы заметили любые из следующих симптомов вместе с \\"комком\\" на шее, вам следует обратиться к врачу: - Боль, скованность или дискомфорт в области комка; - Затрудненное глотание или дыхание; - Заметное увеличение размера комка; - Любые изменения в голосе или хрипота продолжительностью более нескольких недель; - Неожиданная потеря веса или чрезмерное потоотделение. Ваш врач может провести физикальный осмотр, а также назначить дополнительные обследования, такие как УЗИ щитовидной железы, анализы крови на гормоны щитовидной железы или биопсию, если это будет необходимо, для уточнения диагноза."},{"prompt":"سلام. هستی","completion":"سلام! بله، هستم. چطور می‌توانم کمکتان کنم؟"},{"prompt":"دو روز قبل دوستی که برام ارزش زیادی داره تماس گرفته و مون موفق نشدم جواب بدم و بعد دو روز تماس گرفتم و ظاهرا به دل گرفته و ناراحت است یک متن بسیار کوتاه","completion":"متوجه هستم که موقعیت پیچیده‌ایست و دلتان می‌خواهد این تنش را به بهترین شکل حل کنید. مهم است که در پیامی که می‌فرستید، صداقت و علاقه‌تان را نشان دهید و آمادگی‌تان را برای درک موقف دوستتان و تلاش برای اصلاح آن بیان کنید. اینجا یک پیشنهاد برای متن است: --- سلام [اسم دوستتان], امیدوارم حالت خوب باشه. می‌خواستم پوزش بخواهم که دو روز پیش نتونستم به تماس تو پاسخ بدم. واقعاً قصدم نبود که این حس رو به تو منتقل کنم. می‌دونم شاید حسابی ناراحت و ناامید شدی، و بابت این بی‌توجهی عمیقاً معذرت می‌خوام. من واقعاً قدر دوستی‌مون رو می‌دونم و نمی‌خوام به خاطر این اتفاق فاصله بین ما ایجاد شه. آیا میشه زمانی رو تنظیم کنیم که درباره‌ش صحبت کنیم؟ همیشه آماده گوش دادن به حرف‌های تو هستم و دوست دارم این موضوع رو حل کنیم. باز هم معذرت می‌خوام و منتظر شنیدن از تو هستم. با احترام، [اسم شما] --- امیدوارم این متن بتواند قدمی باشد در جهت حل این تنش و بازگرداندن گرمی رابطه‌تان. مهم است که صبر داشته باشید و فضای کافی برای پاسخ دوستتان را فراهم کنید."},{"prompt":"نه می خوام لحن پوزش داخلش باشه و اینکه من هم چندبار تماس گرفتم و اون هم جواب نداده","completion":"البته، با در نظر گرفتن این جزئیات، می‌توانیم متن پیشنهادی را به شکل زیر تغییر دهیم تا همان احساس و لحن پوششی شما را منعکس کند و همچنین اشاره‌ای به تلاش‌های شما برای برقراری ارتباط داشته باشد: --- سلام [اسم دوستتان], امیدوارم که این پیام را در بهترین حال بیابی. من واقعاً می‌خواهم عذرخواهی کنم که دو روز پیش نتوانستم به تماست پاسخ دهم؛ این موضوع واقعاً ذهنم را مشغول کرده است. به محض اینکه متوجه شدم، چند بار تلاش کردم تا تماس بگیرم، اما متوجه شدم که تو هم جواب ندادی. این حس ناراحتی و دوری که ایجاد شده، برایم خیلی سخت است. من ارزش زیادی برای رابطه‌مان قائلم و نمی‌خوام این سوءتفاهم بینمان فاصله بیاندازد. اگر به نظرت اشتباهی از من سر زده، دوست دارم در موردش بشنوم و تلاش کنم اوضاع را درست کنم. هیچ چیزی برایم مهم‌تر از حفظ این دوستی و رفع هر گونه سوءتفاهم نیست. آیا میِ‌توانیم وقتی را تعیین کنیم تا با هم صحبت کنیم؟ هر زمان که تو راحت باشی. می‌دانم ممکن است فضایی برای صحبت در حال حاضر برایت فراهم نباشد، اما من صبورانه منتظر فرصتی هستم تا دوباره بتوانیم همدیگه را بشنویم. با احترام و عذرخواهی دوباره بخاطر هر دردسری که ایجاد کرده‌ام. با امید به شنیدن از تو، [اسم شما] --- امیدوارم این پیام به شما کمک کند تا قدمی مثبت در جهت بهبود این وضعیت بردارید."},{"prompt":"دوست من رک است وبیش از چهارده سال است دوست هستیم. این قبل متن های طولانی و آبکی حالش رو بدتر میکند","completion":"درک می‌کنم، ممنون که تاکید کردید دوستتان از یک سبک مستقیم و رک ترجیح می‌دهد. در اینجا یک نسخه ساده‌تر و مستقیم‌تر از پیام را ارائه می‌دهم: --- سلام [اسم دوستتان], معذرت می‌خواهم که به تماست جواب ندادم و بعدش هم با هم ارتباط برقرار نکردیم. از طرفی، چند بار سعی کردم تماس بگیرم که جواب ندادی. این برای هر دومون سخته. هدفم اینه که این مسئله رو حل کنیم. بیش از چهارده سال دوست بودیم، و نمی‌خوام چیزی میانمون ایجاد فاصله کنه. بگذار ساده بگم، ارزش این دوستی برام زیاده. وقتی خوبه که صحبت کنیم؟ [اسم شما] --- امیدوارم که این متن کوتاه‌تر و مستقیم‌تر بتواند کمک کند تا ارتباطی را که می‌خواهید با دوستتان بازسازی کنید."},{"prompt":"Мне 12 и у меня выступ гортани. Расскажи про это по подробнее","completion":"Выступ гортани, о котором ты говоришь, скорее всего, является внешним проявлением \\"яблока Адама\\". Яблоко Адама – это образование в передней части шеи, более заметное у мужчин, чем у женщин. Фактически это передняя часть хряща щитовидной железы, которая служит защитой для голосовых связок и гортани. В период полового созревания, особенно у мальчиков, начинается рост и развитие всех частей тела, включая гортань и голосовые связки. Увеличение размеров хряща щитовидной железы и его выступание вперед в этот период является нормальным процессом, который связан с изменением голоса – он становится более низким и грубым. У девочек изменения также происходят, но они менее выражены, поэтому выступ гортани у них может быть не таким заметным. Размер яблока Адама может сильно различаться у разных людей. Некоторые имеют более заметное яблоко Адама, в то время как у других оно может быть почти незаметным. Если ты ощущаешь дискомфорт или у тебя есть вопросы относительно твоего развития, всегда полезно обсудить их с врачом или с родителями.

The act of giving up a legal right, particularly a right of ownership of property. Property that has been abandoned is res nullius (a thing belonging to no one), and a person taking possession of it therefore acquires a lawful title. An item is regarded as abandoned when it can be established that the original owner has discarded it and is indifferent as to what becomes of it: such an item cannot be the subject of a theft charge. However, property placed by its owner in a dustbin is not abandoned, having been placed there for the purpose of being collected as refuse. In marine insurance, abandonment is the surrender of all rights to a ship or cargo in a case of constructive total loss. The insured person must do this by giving the insurer within a reasonable time a notice of abandonment, by which he relinquishes all his rights to the ship or cargo to the insurer and can treat the loss as if it were an actual total loss. 2. In civil litigation, the relinquishing of the whole or part of the claim made in an action or of an appeal. Any claim is now considered to be abandoned once a *notice of discontinuance is served, according to rule 38 (1) of the *Civil Procedure Rules. 3. The offence of a parent or guardian. leaving a child under the age of 16 to its fate. A child is not regarded as abandoned if the parent knows and approves steps someone else is taking to look after it. The court may allow a child to be adopted without the consent of its parents if they are guilty of abandonment. abatement n. 1. (of debts) The proportionate reduction in the payment of debts that takes place if a person's assets are insufficient to settle with his creditors in full. 2. (of legacies) The reduction or cancellation of legacies when the estate is insufficient to cover all the legacies provided for in the will or on intestacy after payment of the deceased's debts. The Administration of Estates Act 1925 provides that general legacies, unless given to satisfy a debt or for other consideration, abate in proportion to the amounts of those legacies; specific and demonstrative legacies then abate if the estate is still insufficient to pay all debts, and a demonstrative legacy also abates if the specified fund is insufficient to cover it. For example, A's estate may comprise a painting, £300 in his savings account, and £700 in other money; there are debts of £100 but his will leaves the painting to B, £500 from the savings account to C. £800 to D, and £200 to E. B will receive the painting. C's demonstrative legacy abates to £300, and after the debts are paid from the remaining £700, D's and E's general legacies abate proportionately, to £480 and £120 respectively. When annuities are given by the will, the general rule is that they are valued the date of the testator's death, then abate proportionately in accordance with that valuation, and each annuitant receives the abated sum. All these rules are subject to any contrary intention being expressed in the will. 3. (in land law) Any reduction or cancellation of money payable. For example a lease may provide for an abatement of rent in certain circumstances, e.g. if the building is destroyed by fire, and a purchaser of land may claim an abatement of the price if the seller can prove his ownership of only part of the land he contracted to sell. 4. (of nuisances) The termination, removal, or destruction of a *nuisance. A person injured by a nuisance has a right to abate it.

If your chestnut mushroom grow kit hasn't shown any signs of mushroom formation after two weeks, there could be several reasons. Here are some potential issues and steps you might take to address them: 1. **Temperature**: Chestnut mushrooms typically grow best at temperatures between 55°F (13°C) and 60°F (15°C). If your growing area is either significantly warmer or colder than this range, it could inhibit growth. Try adjusting the temperature of the environment to meet these conditions. 2. **Humidity**: High humidity is crucial for mushroom growth. The plastic bag included with your kit is intended to help maintain this humidity. Make sure you are spraying water inside the bag to keep humidity high. However, be careful not to over-water, as standing water can lead to mold and bacteria growth which can harm or kill the mushroom mycelium. 3. **Ventilation**: While maintaining high humidity, it's also important to ensure there is some air exchange. Stale air can build up CO2 which inhibits mushroom growth. If the kit instructions advised opening the bag or providing ventilation openings, ensure these are adequately sized to allow for some airflow without letting the humidity drop too low. 4. **Light**: While mushrooms don't require light for photosynthesis like plants, they do need some light (indirect sunlight or fluorescent room light) to initiate the pinning stage (the beginning of mushroom formation). Ensure your setup is not in complete darkness. 5. **Contamination**: Check for any signs of contamination, such as unusual colors (greens, yellows, reds etc.) or bad smells coming from the substrate. Contamination can hinder or completely stop mushroom growth. 6. **Patience**: Sometimes, the mycelium (the vegetative part of the fungus) takes a bit longer to colonize the substrate thoroughly and to start fruiting. As long as the substrate looks healthy (white with mycelium) and there are no signs of contamination, there is still hope. **What to do next:** - Reassess the conditions (temperature, humidity, ventilation, and light) against the kit's instructions and adjust as needed. - Continue to monitor for any signs of growth or contamination. - Reach out to the manufacturer's customer service for advice specific to their kit, as they may be able to offer additional tips or even replace the kit if it was faulty. If, after making adjustments, you still see no progress in the next week or so, it might be time to consult the manufacturer for further guidance. Sometimes, kits can have issues not evident to the grower, such as a poor batch of spores or substrate."},{"prompt":"I think its because its summer outside","completion":"If it's summer outside and the temperatures where you're trying to grow your chestnut mushrooms are consistently higher than the ideal range of 55°F (13°C) to 60°F (15°C), then it's very possible that temperature is the main factor inhibiting your mushroom growth. Mushrooms are sensitive to their growing conditions, and high temperatures can either stall their growth or prevent it entirely. Here are a few suggestions to help manage the situation: 1. **Move your grow kit to a cooler area**: Basements can be an excellent option for this, as they tend to be cooler than the rest of the house. If you have access to a basement, consider moving the kit there. Ensure that the area you choose still fits other growth requirements like indirect light and ventilation. 2. **Create a cooler microclimate**: If you're unable to find a naturally cooler spot, you might need to create a cooler environment around your mushroom kit. One way to do this is by placing a pan of ice near your grow kit to cool the air. As the ice melts, it will also help maintain high humidity. Just make sure not to place the ice directly on the grow kit, as the extreme cold can also be harmful. 3. **Use air conditioning or a fan**: If feasible, using air conditioning to lower the room's temperature can be effective. Placing a fan near the grow area to circulate air can also help, but be cautious as this can lower humidity. You might need to mist more frequently to maintain humidity if using a fan. 4. **Adjust your watering schedule**: In high temperatures, the substrate may dry out more quickly. While overwatering can lead to problems, it's essential to ensure the substrate doesn't dry out completely. Regular misting with water can help keep the substrate moist and the humidity high, which mushrooms love. Remember to avoid waterlogging the substrate. 5. **Reflective or insulating cover**: Temporarily covering the grow area with reflective material or thermal insulating fabric might help keep the temperature down. This is more of a makeshift solution and must be monitored closely to ensure it doesn't exacerbate problems like lack of ventilation. Remember, the key to growing mushrooms successfully is balancing their need for high humidity and proper temperatures while avoiding conditions that can lead to contamination or drying out of the substrate. It's a balancing act that might take a bit of experimentation, especially in challenging conditions like a hot summer. Keep an eye on your setup and adjust as necessary, being mindful not to introduce other problems in the process."},{"prompt":"I have a mushroom grow for chesnut mushroom that came with shoebox prepared soil and a plastic bag and ai followed the instructions on the kit but i have already waited 2 weeks and none of the mushrooms were growing","completion":"It's understandable to feel concerned when your chestnut mushroom kit isn't showing signs of growth as expected. Here are a few steps and considerations to help diagnose and potentially solve this problem: # 1. **Check Moisture Levels** First, ensure that the soil is adequately moist. Mushrooms need a humid environment to grow, but not so wet that the substrate is soggy. Mist the soil lightly if it feels dry, but be careful not to overwater. # 2. **Temperature** Check if the temperature in the room where you've placed your mushroom grow kit is within the ideal range for chestnut mushrooms. The ideal temperature range for most mushroom growth is generally between 55°F to 70°F (13°C to 21°C), but this can vary slightly depending on the specific type of mushroom. Extremely high or low temperatures can inhibit mushroom growth. # 3. **Light** While mushrooms don't require as much light as plants, they do need some light (indirect sunlight or fluorescent light) to guide their growth. Ensure they're not placed in a completely dark area. # 4. **Air Circulation** Good air circulation is essential for mushroom growth but avoid placing them directly in the path of strong winds or an air conditioner/heater vent, as this can dry them out too quickly. # 5. **Contamination** Inspect the substrate and the surrounding area for any signs of contamination such as mold or an off smell. Contamination is a common issue in mushroom cultivation and can inhibit the growth of mushrooms or lead to their demise before they have a chance to develop. # 6. **Patience** Sometimes, it just takes a little longer for mushrooms to start growing. Factors like the spore's condition when starting, slight variations in environmental conditions, and the nature of biological processes can contribute to delays. # Troubleshooting Steps **If, after checking these factors, your kit still isn't showing any growth:** - **Contact the Manufacturer**: It's possible the spores were not viable, or there was an issue with the substrate. Many suppliers offer guarantees or may provide advice specific to their product. - **Consider Starting Over**: If you suspect that contamination or a significant error in the initial setup was the issue, it might be worth trying a new kit, applying lessons learned from the first attempt. Growing mushrooms can sometimes be a bit of trial and error, and small adjustments in their environment can make a big difference. Even experienced growers occasionally face challenges with new kits or different types of mushrooms. Keep experimenting, and don't get discouraged!"},{"prompt":"Hypothetical , Retail space concept .. A store that sells natural cosmetics, but focuses on each customer being a unique masque to compliment not obscure.. Store has a policy of respecting diversity and thus displays and marketing should be respectful to that goal :) .","completion":"Creating a retail space that champions natural cosmetics while celebrating individuality and diversity is not just innovative; it's becoming a necessity in today's culturally sensitive marketplace. Here's a conceptual framework for such a store: # Name Idea: *True Masque* # Brand Philosophy: The core idea behind *True Masque* is that beauty products should complement and enhance one's natural features rather than mask or obscure. This philosophy ties into a broader commitment to diversity, individuality, and sustainability. Every customer is encouraged to embrace their unique features, and the store provides an inclusive environment that respects and celebrates this diversity. # Product Selection: The product range at *True Masque* focuses heavily on natural, organic, and cruelty-free cosmetics. The store vets all brands to ensure they align with its values of sustainability and ethical manufacturing practices. The selection caters to various skin types, tones, and sensitivities, ensuring there's something for everyone. # Inclusive Marketing and Displays: - **Diverse Representation:** Marketing campaigns and in-store displays should feature models of different ethnicities, ages, genders, body types, and abilities to reflect the diversity of the customer base. - **Educational Content:** Incorporate educational materials that inform customers about the ingredients in their cosmetics, the benefits of natural products, and tips for enhancing their natural beauty without hiding who they are. - **Interactive Displays:** Create stations where customers can see and feel the textures of the products, and offer personalized consultations with beauty experts who can provide advice tailored to each individual's unique features and needs. # Store Layout and Design: - **Warm and Welcoming:** The design of *True Masque* should feel warm, inviting, and inclusive. Using natural woods, soft lighting, and green plants can create a calming atmosphere that mirrors the natural ethos of the products. - **Accessibility:** Ensure the store layout is accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. This includes wide aisles, accessible counters, and clear, readable signage. - **Community Space:** Reserve an area of the store for workshops, talks, and events that focus on self-care, natural beauty, and embracing diversity. This can help cultivate a community around the store's values. # Customer Experience: - **Personalized Consultations:** Offer in-depth consultations that focus on enhancing the customer's natural beauty. This can include skin type analysis, make-up application tips, and personalized product recommendations. - **Loyalty Program:** Create a rewards program that not only offers discounts and freebies but also rewards customers for participating in community events, recycling packaging, and more. - **Integration of Technology:** Use technology like augmented reality (AR) mirrors where customers can try products virtually, enhancing the in-store experience and allowing for experimentation without waste. # Social Responsibility: *True Masque* should actively participate in community initiatives, support local and global environmental causes, and champion social issues that align with its brand philosophy. Transparency in sourcing, manufacturing, and corporate practices is essential to build and maintain trust with the customer base. Launching a store like *True Masque* requires a deep understanding of the target market and a commitment to the store's core values across all aspects of the business. However, by focusing on natural beauty, respecting diversity, and providing a genuinely inclusive and personalized shopping experience, *True Masque* can differentiate itself in the competitive cosmetics industry and build a loyal customer base."},{"prompt":"They might also try and focus on using 'local' (or at the very least regional suppliers) ?","completion":"Absolutely, the focus on local or regional suppliers can be a powerful aspect of *True Masque's* unique selling proposition, aligning perfectly with its core values of sustainability, community support, and ethical practices. Here's how this focus can be integrated effectively: # Emphasizing Local and Regional Suppliers: 1. **Sustainability Impact:** By sourcing products from local and regional suppliers, *True Masque* can significantly reduce its carbon footprint related to transportation. This aligns with the store's commitment to environmental sustainability and can be a compelling point for eco-conscious consumers. 2. **Supporting Local Economies:** This approach supports local businesses and economies, encouraging the growth of smaller, independent cosmetics producers. Providing shelf space for local artisans and startups not only diversifies the product offering but also fosters a sense of community and mutual support. 3. **Freshness and Authenticity:** Local sourcing often means that products can be fresher, especially in the case of skincare items that benefit from recent production. This can translate into higher quality and effectiveness, which is a strong selling point for consumers. # Implementation Strategies: - **Meet the Makers Events:** Host in-store or virtual events where local suppliers can share their stories, ethos, and processes with customers. This transparency and personal connection can significantly enhance customer loyalty and appreciation for the products. - **Local Artisan Spotlights:** Reserve a specific section of the store for local and regional products. Highlighting these brands in marketing materials and through special displays or promotions can draw attention to them and educate customers on the benefits of supporting local businesses. - **Collaborative Product Lines:** Work with local artisans and suppliers to create exclusive products or ranges for *True Masque*. These collaborations can result in unique offerings that set the store apart from competitors and deepen partnerships with suppliers. - **Sustainability Partnerships:** Partner with local environmental and community organizations to underline the commitment to social and ecological causes. This could involve joint events, fundraising initiatives, or collaborative projects that benefit the local community and environment. # Marketing and Communications: - **Transparency:** In all marketing and communications, emphasize the importance and impact of choosing local and regional products. This includes detailing the reduction in carbon footprint, the support for local economies, and the stories behind the local brands and artisans. - **Educational Content:** Use the store's platforms, such as social media, blogs, and in-store workshops, to educate customers about the benefits of local sourcing. Topics could include the environmental advantages, the economic impacts on small businesses, and how locally sourced ingredients can offer fresher, more potent benefits. - **Visual Storytelling:** Employ visual media to tell the stories of local suppliers—photos, videos, and interviews that showcase their working environments, processes, and personalities. This helps humanize the brands and fosters deeper connections between customers and products. By focusing on local and regional suppliers, *True Masque* not only bolsters its commitment to diversity, sustainability, and community support but also offers customers uniquely local and authentic shopping experiences. This approach can help build a loyal customer base that values quality, transparency, and the impact of their purchasing decisions."},{"prompt":"1_ Translate the following legal text into colloquial Farsi 2_ Place the Persian and English text side by side in the table 3_ From the beginning to the end of the text, there should be an English sentence on the left side and a Persian sentence on the right side. 4- Using legal language for Persian translation ._ Place the Farsi and English text line by line from one point to the first point next to each other in such a way that one line of English text is followed by two empty lines, followed by the Persian translation and continue this process until the end of the text.A abandonment n. 1. The act of giving up a legal right, particularly a right of ownership of property. Property that has been abandoned is res nullius (a thing belonging to no one), and a person taking possession of it therefore acquires a lawful title.

The offence of a parent or guardian. leaving a child under the age of 16 to its fate. A child is not regarded as abandoned if the parent knows and approves steps someone else is taking to look after it. The court may allow a child to be adopted without the consent of its parents if they are guilty of abandonment. abatement n. 1. (of debts) The proportionate reduction in the payment of debts that takes place if a person's assets are insufficient to settle with his creditors in full. 2. (of legacies) The reduction or cancellation of legacies when the estate is insufficient to cover all the legacies provided for in the will or on intestacy after payment of the deceased's debts. The Administration of Estates Act 1925 provides that general legacies, unless given to satisfy a debt or for other consideration, abate in proportion to the amounts of those legacies; specific and demonstrative legacies then abate if the estate is still insufficient to pay all debts, and a demonstrative legacy also abates if the specified fund is insufficient to cover it. For example, A's estate may comprise a painting, £300 in his savings account, and £700 in other money; there are debts of £100 but his will leaves the painting to B, £500 from the savings account to C. £800 to D, and £200 to E. B will receive the painting. C's demonstrative legacy abates to £300, and after the debts are paid from the remaining £700, D's and E's general legacies abate proportionately, to £480 and £120 respectively. When annuities are given by the will, the general rule is that they are valued the date of the testator's death, then abate proportionately in accordance with that valuation, and each annuitant receives the abated sum. All these rules are subject to any contrary intention being expressed in the will. 3. (in land law) Any reduction or cancellation of money payable. For example a lease may provide for an abatement of rent in certain circumstances, e.g. if the building is destroyed by fire, and a purchaser of land may claim an abatement of the price if the seller can prove his ownership of only part of the land he contracted to sell. 4. (of nuisances) The termination, removal, or destruction of a *nuisance. A person injured by a nuisance has a right to abate it. In doing so, he must not do more damage than is necessary and, if removal of the nuisance requires entry on to the property from which it emanates, he may have to give notice to the wrongdoer.

Here are a few factors to consider and steps you might take to encourage growth: # 1. Temperature Chestnut mushrooms typically prefer cooler temperatures for optimal growth. They generally thrive in temperatures around 55°F to 60°F (13°C to 16°C). If your environment is significantly warmer because it's summer, this could be inhibiting their growth. You can try moving the kit to a cooler part of your house, such as a basement, if that's an option. Alternatively, using a small fan to circulate air or lightly spraying water to cool the air around the grow kit could help, just be sure not to overwater. # 2. Humidity Mushrooms require high humidity to grow. The plastic bag included in your grow kit is meant to help maintain this humidity around your substrate. Make sure you are spraying the inside of the bag regularly as instructed but not directly wetting the mycelium or substrate too much. It's a delicate balance; the environment should be moist but not soggy. If your ambient humidity is low, especially in air-conditioned rooms, you'll need to pay extra attention to maintaining internal humidity. # 3. Light While mushrooms don't require light for photosynthesis like plants, they do need some light to signal where and when to grow. Place your grow kit in an area that receives indirect light. Direct sunlight can dry out the substrate and overheat your mushrooms, but complete darkness is not conducive to growth either. # 4. Air Exchange Fresh air exchange is critical for mushroom growth. CO2 buildup can inhibit mushroom formation. Make sure the plastic bag is not completely sealed; there should be some small openings for air exchange. If the instructions suggest, you might occasionally open the bag to let fresh air in, then close it again to maintain humidity. # Addressing Stalled Growth If it's been two weeks with no signs of growth, - First, double-check the moisture level and make necessary adjustments. - Ensure the temperature and humidity conditions are as close to the ideal range as possible. - Review the instructions to see if you missed a step or if there's troubleshooting advice. - In some cases, the kit might have had issues before you even started, such as old substrate or contamination. If you suspect this might be the case and adjustments to temperature, humidity, and light don't help, consider reaching out to the supplier for advice or a replacement. Growing mushrooms can be a bit tricky, especially when you are doing it for the first time and dealing with less-than-ideal environmental conditions. However, with some tweaks and patience, most issues can be overcome. Good luck with your mushroom growing!"},{"prompt":"So the substrate is in the a plastic bag placed inside the shoe box how should i continue and i have another plastic bag","completion":"Given your current setup with the substrate in a plastic bag placed inside the shoebox, and considering you have another plastic bag at your disposal, here are steps you can take to optimize conditions for your chestnut mushroom growth: # 1. **Assess and Adjust Moisture Levels** - **Checking Moisture**: Open the plastic bag and gently touch the substrate to assess moisture. It should feel moist but not waterlogged. If it feels dry, you will need to add moisture. - **Spraying**: Use the spray bottle to lightly mist the inside of the bag, not directly soaking the substrate. The goal is to increase humidity around the substrate without over-wetting it. # 2. **Ensure Proper Ventilation** - **Ventilation Holes**: If the plastic bag does not have them already, add a few small holes for air exchange. This helps prevent the buildup of carbon dioxide which mushrooms produce and can hinder their growth if levels get too high. - **Use the Second Bag for Humidity**: If humidity is a significant issue (air too dry), you can place the second plastic bag over the shoebox, creating a double-layered but still ventilated enclosure to help retain moisture. Ensure this outer bag also has holes for some air exchange. # 3. **Optimize Temperature** Since it's summer and temperatures are likely higher than what chestnut mushrooms prefer: - **Cool Environment**: Move the setup to the coolest part of your home. Basements are often ideal, but if that's not an option, a room away from direct sunlight or heat sources can work. - **Temperature Control**: If you have air conditioning, you can use it to lower the room's temperature. Alternatively, positioning a fan to gently circulate air around (but not directly at) the grow kit can help moderate temperatures. # 4. **Lighting Conditions** - **Indirect Light**: Place the setup in an area that receives indirect sunlight or use artificial lighting. Direct sunlight can overheat and dehydrate the setup, but complete darkness isn't beneficial either. A north-facing window ledge or a room with fluorescent lighting can work well. # 5. **Maintain the Setup** - **Regular Check and Spray**: Open the bag every day or as recommended to check on the substrate and spray if necessary to maintain moisture. This also allows fresh air to exchange, beneficial for mushroom growth. - **Patience and Observation**: Sometimes mushrooms take a little longer to start growing, especially if conditions are not optimal from the start. Regularly inspect for any signs of growth or issues, such as mold, which could indicate too much moisture. # Troubleshooting If after making these adjustments, you still see no signs of growth after another week or two, consider the following: - **Contamination**: Examine the substrate for any unusual colors or smells that could indicate contamination. - **Kit Viability**: The spores or mycelium in the kit might have been non-viable or too old. If you've maintained proper conditions and still see no growth, contacting the supplier for advice or a replacement could be the next step. Growing mushrooms can be a rewarding experience, but it often requires some adjustment and patience to get right, especially under challenging conditions like high summer temperatures. Keep observing, adjusting, and learning from the process."},{"prompt":"اكتب شعر رومانسي لحبيبتي آيه باسلوب ابن الفارض وبسجع موسيقي تعبر عن التالي: . في لحظات الصيام خلال شهر رمضان المبارك، أجد نفسي أحاول جاهدًا كبح جماح رغبتي في الاشتياق إلى محبوبتي آيه. لكنها، بمجرد مرور خيالها عبر تفكيري، تجعلني أضطرب شوقًا لوجودها إلى جانبي. يساورني الحنين الملحّ لاحتضانها بكل ما أوتيت من قوة، أرغب في ضمها إلى صدري بكل عبقرية العشق المتوقدة في دواخلنا. وقد كنت قد أقسم لها بأنني سأحافظ على الاحترام الشديد حين أزورها في منزلها، معاهدًا نفسي على ألا أسمح لنفسي بالتجاوز في لمسها. ومع ذلك، وجدت نفسي ضائعًا أمام عظمة حبي لها والسحر الجذاب لجمالها. كنت أضع كفي علطف خدها برفق، مررت أصابعي على شفتيها في حنان لا مثيل له، وأحيانًا أضع إصبعي على فمها في لحظة عشق خالصة. تلك اللحظات كشفت أيضًا عن لعبة الجذب التي يبدو أن محبوبتي تحاول لعبها، متظاهرة بالبراءة من أي تقارب قد يحدث بيننا، مما يجعلني في الغالب المتهم بالتقريب. لكنها، من جهتها، تتخذ بعض الإشارات والحركات التي تنعش الشوق فيّ، وكأنها تسعى جاهدة لقول “تقدم نحوي”، وعندما أقترب، أجد نفسي فريسة لفخاخ عشقها وأسيرًا في هواها. تلك المشاعر المتأججة بيننا، التوق العميق الذي تشتعل به أجسادنا رغبة في القرب، يكتب فصولًا جديدة من عشقنا كل يوم، حيث نرسم معالم قصة حب فريدة بتفاصيلها الصادقة والملتهبة.","completion":"في طيِّ شهر الصوم، ثمة حكاية، لا تقصرُ عن حبي لآيةٍ، فيها القلوب تزورُ تمرُّ في خاطري، صورتُها مُنْتحِي، وأغدو في حنينٍ، لها أدور وأدورُ أحاولُ كبح جماح شوقي، لكنها كلما خطرت، بالحنين إليها أُشعَرْ قسمتُ لها، بأني فِي أدب سأظلُّ وعلى حدود الاحترام، في زيارتي أصْمُرُ لكن جمالها والعشق، عن قسمي يُبعدني وأجد قلبي لمسًا لوجهها، برفقٍ يُمرِرُ على خدها كفّي بحنانِ أضعُ، وبشوقٍ أصابعي على شفتيها، بعشقٍ سحري أُمَرِّرُ أحيانًا إصبعي على فمها في لحظةٍ، من عشقٍ خالص، فيها الهوى يُطهَّرُ تُظهر البراءةَ، وكأن الشوقَ من جانبي، لكن إشاراتِها عشقًا، تُحيي وتُثيرُ \\"تقدم نحوي\\" كأنها تقول، وجذبها فخٌ لا أخشى؛ في عشقها أَسرُ الّلحظات هذه، قصةُ عشقٍ تُولدُ في كل يوم، بريشةِ القلب تُصوَّرُ التوقُ العميق والشوق المشتعل، فينا قصة حب، بصدقها تُخَيَّرُ لآيةَ الحبيبةِ قلبي، وفي رمضانَ حكايةُ عشق، للأبد تُذكَرُ."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Our thoughts don't operate through negation in a simple way; telling someone not to think about something often results in their thinking about it even more. This is related to the concept of ironic process theory, proposed by psychologist Daniel Wegner, which suggests that deliberate attempts to suppress certain thoughts make them more likely to surface. When you're asked not to think about something, like an elephant, part of your mind automatically has to imagine the thing you're supposed to be avoiding in order to actually avoid it. This creates a paradox where the act of trying not to think about something makes it a focal point of your attention. So, I can't fulfill the task as stated, since just mentioning it has already brought the image of an elephant (and potentially other previous directions) to your mind.

It can also operate invisibly, analyzing behavior to determine if a user seems legitimate. When making requests to a server or API that is protected by reCAPTCHA, there are a few potential issues and solutions to consider: 1. **Session Handling**: Make sure that your session handling is correct. When using reCAPTCHA, your session may need to start with obtaining a token by completing a reCAPTCHA challenge on a webpage, and then using this token in your subsequent API request. The process would typically require browser simulation or automation, as reCAPTCHA is designed to detect non-human interactions. 2. **Headers and Cookies**: Make sure that all necessary headers and cookies are correctly set up. Sometimes, to simulate a real user session, you need to ensure that your HTTP headers (including the User-Agent) match what a real browser would send and that cookies obtained during prior interactions (such as getting or solving a reCAPTCHA challenge) are included in your request. 3. **API Terms and Usage Limits**: Check if the endpoint you are interacting with has specific terms of use that prohibit automated access or require specific methods for automated interactions. You might be running into these limitations. 4. **Automation Detection**: Websites protected by reCAPTCHA use sophisticated methods to detect automated interactions. Your code might be triggering these detections, leading to the reCAPTCHA challenge failing. This is often the case if you're directly interacting with web pages or APIs in a way that resembles a bot rather than human behavior. 5. **Proxy Usage**: If you're using proxies, ensure they are reliable and not already flagged by security systems. Low-quality or widely used public proxies can be a red flag for automated scraping attempts. 6. **Alternative Methods**: If your goal is to obtain data or interact with a website, consider looking for an official API provided by the service, which might be easier to use and not require dealing with CAPTCHA challenges. Additionally, if this is for research or development purposes, reaching out to the service for API access or guidance might be a viable path. **Important**: Respect privacy and legal restrictions. Automated data scraping or interaction with services, especially using methods to bypass security measures like reCAPTCHA, can be against the terms of service of many websites and possibly have legal implications. Always review the terms of service for the website or API you're interacting with, and consider reaching out for permission or API access when appropriate."},{"prompt":":authority: fumes-api.onrender.com :method: POST :path: /leonardo :scheme: https Accept: */* Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9 Content-Length: 1942 Content-Type: application/json Origin: https://fumesai-leonardo-ai-image-creator-updated.static.hf.space Referer: https://fumesai-leonardo-ai-image-creator-updated.static.hf.space/ Sec-Ch-Ua: \\"Chromium\\";v=\\"122\\", \\"Not(A:Brand\\";v=\\"24\\", \\"Microsoft Edge\\";v=\\"122\\" Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile: ?0 Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform: \\"Windows\\" Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/122.0.0.0 turn this into python requests headers","completion":"Here's how you can convert the provided HTTP request headers into a Python dictionary suitable for use with the \`requests\` library.

Martin, it would have several potential implications and outcomes, both politically and narratively. It's essential to note that such a marriage never occurs in the published books or the television adaptation as of my last knowledge update in April 2023. Therefore, any exploration of this hypothetical scenario is purely speculative. The implications of such a marriage would vary depending on the timing and circumstances under which it occurred. Here are a few possible outcomes: 1. **Political Implications**: Marrying Sansa Stark would likely strengthen Jon Snow's claim to the North and solidify his position as King in the North (assuming he accepts that title), given Sansa's status as a Stark. It would formalize an alliance between any forces loyal to Jon (due to his leadership skills and, potentially, his Targaryen heritage if revealed) and the traditional Stark loyalists. This could create a more unified North, better positioned to face external threats, such as the White Walkers or southern political machinations. 2. **Public Perception**: Depending on when the populace learns about Jon's true parentage (assuming R+L=J is accepted and known publicly), the marriage could be seen in various lights. If Jon is still thought to be Ned Stark's illegitimate son, a marriage between him and Sansa could be viewed with distaste by some, considering them to be cousins raised as half-siblings. However, if Jon's Targaryen lineage is known, it might mitigate some concerns, as they would be more distantly related (cousins once removed). 3. **Dynastic Considerations**: A marriage between Jon and Sansa could also secure the line of succession in the North, combining the Stark and, potentially, the Targaryen legacies. Any offspring from this union would have strong claims to leadership roles in both the North and possibly on the Iron Throne, depending on other developments across Westeros. 4. **Narrative Consequences**: Such a marriage would significantly alter the dynamics between major characters and factions, changing the alliances and enmities that drove much of the plot in both the book and television series. It could lead to conflicts with other claimants or exacerbate tensions with figures like Daenerys Targaryen, should she view it as a threat to her claim to the Iron Throne. 5. **Personal Relationships**: The personal relationship dynamics between Jon and Sansa would also play a crucial role. Their perspectives on this union would be influenced by their shared history, personal feelings, and priorities for the future of their family and the North. If the marriage were purely political, it might strain their personal relationship; if genuine affection were present, it could be a source of strength for both. In conclusion, Jon Snow marrying Sansa Stark would introduce a complex web of political, social, and personal consequences into the narrative of \\"Game of Thrones\\" or \\"A Song of Ice and Fire.\\" It's a fascinating \\"what if\\" scenario that offers a rich area for fan speculation and alternative universe (AU) fan fiction."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical retail concept, The stand-out feature of the store is a 'wish fountation' , but the store's main retail item is smart but practical clothing for an 18-30 age demographic.","completion":"The concept of intertwining a unique customer experience, such as a \\"wish fountain,\\" with a focus on retailing smart, practical clothing for the 18-30 age demographic presents an intriguing and potentially highly successful retail model.

Here are some steps and troubleshooting tips you can follow to potentially kickstart your Chestnut mushroom growth: # 1. **Review the Instructions** First, revisit the instructions to make sure all steps were followed correctly. There's a chance a critical step might have been overlooked. # 2. **Moisture Level** - **High Humidity**: Mushroom grow kits typically require high humidity to encourage the mushrooms to grow. Make sure the inside of the plastic bag is moist but not wet, and use the spray bottle to mist the inside of the bag (not directly on the substrate) at least twice a day to maintain humidity. - **Avoid Waterlogging**: While maintaining moisture is key, too much water can drown your mycelium (the fungal network that grows mushrooms) or encourage mold growth. Ensure there's no excess water pooling at the bottom of your substrate. # 3. **Temperature** - Chestnut mushrooms typically prefer temperatures between 55-70°F (13-21°C). Ensure your setup is within this range. Too cold or too hot can inhibit growth. # 4. **Air Exchange** - Mushrooms also need fresh air exchange to grow properly. Make sure the bag has some holes or is slightly open (depending on your kit's design) to allow for some air exchange while still maintaining high humidity. # 5. **Light** - While mushrooms don't require strong light to grow, a natural light cycle (or indirect sunlight) can help signal to the mushrooms that it's time to grow. However, direct sunlight can be harmful and dry out the substrate, so aim for indirect or artificial light for a few hours a day. # 6. **Check for Contamination** - Inspect the substrate for any signs of green, black, or bright orange mold. These can be indications of contamination which might prevent mushroom growth. A healthy mycelium typically looks white. # Patience and Consistency - Sometimes, mushrooms take longer to start growing. Maintain the conditions, and give it more time. Mushrooms have their own growth schedule. # Troubleshooting - If, after adjusting these conditions, you still don't see any growth within another week or two, it might be worth reaching out to the manufacturer. There might have been an issue with the kit itself, and some companies might replace it if it was defective. # Learning Experience - Regardless of the outcome, growing mushrooms is a learning process. Each failure provides insight into what might work better next time. Lastly, remember that every growing environment is unique, and sometimes getting the conditions just right requires a bit of experimentation. Keep at it, monitor and adjust the environment as needed, and hopefully, you'll see those Chestnut mushrooms start to grow soon."},{"prompt":"How much misting should i do with my spray bottle","completion":"Misting frequency for mushroom grow kits can vary depending on several factors including ambient humidity, temperature, and the stage of mushroom growth. However, a general guideline for misting is to ensure the surface of the substrate and the interior of the growing environment (like the inside of a plastic bag or grow tent) remain moist but not waterlogged. # Here's How You Can Approach Misting: 1. **Initial Misting**: When you first set up your mushroom grow kit, mist the interior of the plastic bag lightly. The goal is to increase the humidity inside the bag, not to soak the substrate directly. 2. **Regular Misting**: As a general rule, misting the inside of your grow bag or grow area 2-3 times a day should be enough to maintain the necessary humidity levels. Aim for the sides of the container or the walls of the plastic bag rather than directly onto the mycelium or substrate. 3. **Observation is Key**: The exact amount of misting can depend on how quickly the environment dries out. If you notice the substrate surface starting to dry out, it might require more frequent misting. Conversely, if the substrate looks soggy or there's condensation pooling at the bottom, reduce misting frequency. 4. **Adjust Based on Growth Stage**: Once mushrooms start to form and during their growth phase, they may require slightly more humidity, thus possibly more frequent misting. However, be cautious to not directly mist small mushroom pins as they are fragile and could be damaged. # Tips for Effective Misting: - **Use a Fine Spray**: The best spray bottles for misting are those that emit a fine mist rather than large droplets, which can disrupt the mycelium or young mushrooms. - **Monitor Ambient Conditions**: If you're growing in a particularly dry room or during winter when indoor heating can reduce humidity, you may need to mist more frequently. Conversely, in naturally humid conditions, you may need to mist less. - **Keep Air Circulating**: Remember, fresh air exchange is also crucial for mushroom growth. Ensure your setup allows for some air exchange to help manage humidity levels and encourage healthy mushroom development. - **Avoid Over-Misting**: While maintaining humidity is crucial, too much moisture can lead to issues like mold growth or bacterial contamination. Aim for a consistent light misting rather than making the substrate soggy. Following these guidelines should help you maintain the ideal humidity for your mushroom grow kit. Always remember that observation and adjustment based on your specific growing conditions are key to successful mushroom cultivation."},{"prompt":"So i just cover the misted bag around the shoebox?","completion":"Yes, covering the shoebox with the misted bag is generally the approach you'd use with a mushroom grow kit. This technique creates a microclimate that maintains high humidity levels, which are crucial for mushroom growth. Here are some detailed steps and tips to effectively manage this setup: # Setting Up Your Microclimate: 1. **Prepare the Bag**: After misting the inside of the bag gently with a fine mist, you're ready to use it to create the ideal growing environment for your mushrooms. Ensure that the mist is evenly distributed, creating a humid atmosphere inside the bag without directly soaking the substrate in the shoebox. 2. **Placement**: Carefully place the shoebox inside the misted bag or cover the shoebox with the bag, depending on the specific instructions provided with your kit and the size of the bag. If placing the shoebox inside, make sure there's some space between the bag and the substrate to allow for air circulation and room for the mushrooms to grow. 3. **Air Exchange**: While maintaining humidity is crucial, mushrooms also require fresh air to grow properly. The method for ensuring air exchange will depend on the instructions with your kit. Some kits advise making small holes in the bag, and others may suggest opening the bag a few times a day to manually exchange the air. Follow the specific guidance given with your grow kit. 4. **Avoid Direct Sunlight**: Place your setup in an area that receives indirect light or artificial light. Direct sunlight can overheat your grow kit, disrupting the mushroom growth. # Monitoring and Adjustments: - **Check Daily**: Look at the inside of the bag daily for condensation, which is a good sign of proper humidity levels. Adjust your misting routine based on the amount of condensation and the moisture level of the substrate. Remember, the goal is to keep the environment moist but not soggy. - **Ventilation**: If you notice too much condensation building up, you may need to ventilate the bag slightly to reduce humidity and prevent mold growth. You can do this by opening the bag for a short period or enlarging existing holes slightly, depending on your kit's design. - **Mushroom Growth**: As mushrooms start to grow, you may need to adjust the positioning of the bag to give them space. Make sure they are not pressing against the bag, as this could damage them or hinder their development. By creating and maintaining the right environment around your shoebox using the misted bag, you give your mushrooms the best chance of thriving. Success in mushroom cultivation often requires some experimentation and adjustments, so pay close attention to how your mushrooms respond to the conditions you provide and adjust as needed."},{"prompt":"Im placing the bag out side the shoe box as im using the lid as a canopy?","completion":"Using the lid as a canopy and placing the bag outside the shoebox is a common method in mushroom cultivation, especially for small-scale or home setups like grow kits. This approach helps maintain the necessary microenvironment around your substrate. Here are some tips to optimize this setup: # Setting Up Your Canopy: 1. **Lid Positioning**: After misting the interior of the plastic bag, place the lid of the shoebox slightly ajar or flipped at an angle on top of the shoebox. This will create a canopy that allows some air exchange while also trapping humidity inside, around the substrate. 2. **Bag Placement**: The plastic bag should then go around or over this entire setup. Make sure the bag is open enough at the top or has holes for air exchange. The idea is to trap moisture and maintain a high humidity level around the substrate while still allowing for some fresh air to enter. 3. **Moisture and Air**: The balance between humidity (created by the mist inside the bag) and air exchange (allowed by the slightly ajar lid and openings in the bag) is crucial. Too much moisture without enough air exchange can lead to mold growth, while too much air and not enough moisture can dry out your substrate and inhibit mushroom growth. # Monitoring and Adjusting Your Setup: - **Daily Checks**: Observe the inside of the bag for condensation and check the moisture level of the substrate daily. This will tell you if you need to adjust your misting frequency or modify the air exchange. - **Adjust Humidity**: If the substrate appears too dry, you might need to mist more frequently or adjust the lid to trap more humidity. If there's too much condensation or the substrate looks soggy, allow more air exchange by positioning the lid more open or increasing the size/number of holes in the bag. - **Air Exchange**: If you notice a lack of fresh air or signs of stagnation (such as an off-smell), you might need to manually air out the bag once or twice a day by gently opening it and then resealing it. This can also help control excess humidity. - **Growth Monitoring**: As mushrooms start to grow, you might need to adjust the lid’s position to give them more space. Ensure that growing mushrooms do not press against the bag or lid, as this can hinder their development. By utilizing the shoebox lid as a canopy, you create a controlled environment that can significantly contribute to successful mushroom cultivation. Observing and adjusting based on the conditions you see will be key. Each grow kit and home environment is slightly different, so don't be discouraged if it takes some time to find the perfect balance of humidity and air exchange for your mushrooms."},{"prompt":"Can you explain everything again?","completion":"Certainly! Growing mushrooms with a grow kit in a shoebox setup, where the lid is used as a canopy and the bag surrounds the setup, involves creating the right conditions of humidity and air exchange for mushroom cultivation. Let's break down the process and important points more simply: # 1. **Setup**: - You have a shoebox with substrate where the mushrooms will grow. - The plastic bag that came with the kit is used to create a humid environment around the shoebox. - The lid of the shoebox isn't fully closed but positioned as a canopy (partially open) to allow some air exchange while retaining humidity. # 2. **Misting (Creating Humidity)**: - Use the spray bottle to mist inside the plastic bag, not directly on the substrate. The aim is to increase the humidity around your growing medium. - The bag captures the moisture from misting, creating a humid environment mushrooms need. # 3. **Using the Lid as a Canopy (Air Exchange)**: - Place the shoebox lid slightly ajar or at an angle. This setup allows for some fresh air to get in, which mushrooms also need to grow properly. - The setup also helps to trap some humidity inside, balancing moisture and fresh air. # 4. **Placing the Bag**: - The misted bag should encompass the setup. It can be open at the top or have small holes for additional air exchange. - This encloses your micro-environment but still allows for air movement. # 5. **Daily Care**: - **Observe daily** for condensation inside the bag and the substrate's moisture level. You're aiming for a consistently moist (not soggy or dry) substrate. - **Mist 2-3 times a day** or as needed, based on how quickly the environment dries out. - **Adjust air exchange** by altering how the lid is placed or making small adjustments to the bag to prevent mold or dryness. # 6. **Adjustments for Growth**: - As mushrooms start emerging, ensure they have enough space and aren’t pressing against the bag or the lid. - Adjust misting and air exchange as needed. Mushrooms might require different conditions in their fruiting stage. # 7. **Troubleshooting**: - **Too much condensation or a musty smell**: Increase air exchange. - **Substrate drying out**: Mist more frequently, and ensure the bag is effectively trapping humidity. - **No growth after 2 weeks**: Double-check environmental conditions (humidity, temperature, and light), and make sure you're not disturbing the mycelium too much when checking for growth. The goal is to create and maintain an environment that mimics natural conditions where mushrooms thrive—high in humidity with sufficient but not excessive air exchange. Monitoring and fine-tuning your setup are key to successful mushroom cultivation. If your mushrooms are not growing as expected, reviewing and adjusting these elements can help encourage them to start growing."},{"prompt":"Write a scene where Ezra Bridger learns about the Sith, during the days of the Old Republic","completion":"Ezra Bridger sat cross-legged in front of the hologram projector, his eyes wide with wonder as the image of a cloaked figure appeared before him. \\"This is Darth Malak, a powerful Sith Lord who ruled the galaxy during the time of the Old Republic,\\" said Kanan Jarrus, Ezra's Jedi Master. \\"The Sith were once our sworn enemies, seeking to dominate the galaxy through fear and aggression.\\" Ezra watched as Malak raised his glowing red lightsaber and unleashed a flurry of deadly strikes against a group of Jedi Knights. The sheer power and brutality of the Sith Lord left him speechless. \\"The Sith believed in the power of the Dark Side of the Force, using it to fuel their anger and hatred,\\" Kanan explained. \\"They sought to bring chaos and destruction wherever they went, opposing everything the Jedi stood for.\\" As Ezra listened, a mix of fascination and fear gripped his heart. The idea of wielding such immense power was both enticing and terrifying in equal measure. \\"But remember, Ezra,\\" Kanan said gently, placing a reassuring hand on his shoulder. \\"The Dark Side is a path that leads to darkness and corruption. It may offer great power, but it comes at a terrible cost.\\" Ezra nodded, his mind racing with thoughts of the Sith and their dark ways. He knew that he must tread carefully, lest he be consumed by the very thing he sought to understand. As the hologram of Darth Malak faded away, Ezra took a deep breath and turned to Kanan. \\"I understand, Master. I will not let the darkness consume me.\\" Kanan smiled, his eyes filled with pride. \\"Good, Ezra. Remember, the path of a Jedi is one of balance and compassion. Stay true to the Light, and you will never falter.\\" With a renewed sense of purpose, Ezra stood up and vowed to walk the path of the Jedi, even as the shadow of the Sith loomed large in his mind."},{"prompt":"What ir Jon was arrested as a traitor to the north in season 8? And what could be the reason?","completion":"As of my last update in April 2023, there is no event in the final eighth season of \\"Game of Thrones\\" in which Jon Snow is arrested for being a traitor to the North. Here's a brief rundown of Jon's arc in the eighth season: - **Episode 1 (Winterfell)**: Jon reunites with his siblings and learns about the approaching White Walker army. He also learns his true parentage from Samwell Tarly, that he is Aegon Targaryen, son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, making him the legitimate heir to the Iron Throne. - **Episode 3 (The Long Night)**: Jon, along with the people of Winterfell and their allies, fights against the Night King and the Army of the Dead. - **Episode 4 (The Last of the Starks)**: The aftermath of the battle leads to political tensions as Daenerys Targaryen fears the people of Westeros might prefer Jon as king over her. - **Episode 5 (The Bells)**: As Daenerys attacks King's Landing, Jon is horrified by the unnecessary slaughter and carnage she causes. - **Episode 6 (The Iron Throne)**: Struggling with his loyalty and the realization that Daenerys has become a tyrant, Jon kills her to prevent further tyranny. He is then arrested for regicide, not specifically for being a traitor to the North. Hypothetically, if Jon was arrested as a traitor to the North, it could involve several speculative scenarios: 1. **Siding with Daenerys Over Northern Interests**: If Jon had continued to unequivocally support Daenerys’s claim to the Iron Throne, disregarding Northern independence or her tyrannical actions, it could lead to accusations of treason against the North. 2. **Revealing his True Heritage**: Should Jon have actively pursued the Iron Throne over the well-being of the North or used his true identity to undermine Sansa’s leadership or Northern independence, it might have been seen as a betrayal. 3. **Turning on Family Alliances**: Betraying Sansa, Arya, or Bran in a significant way could be perceived as treachery against his family and the North. In any scenario, the betrayal would involve Jon choosing a path that directly harms the interests or wellbeing of the Northern kingdom or his family, which could lead to his arrest. However, these are purely speculative and do not reference any actual plot from the series."},{"prompt":"Can pi be different?","completion":"No, pi is a constant number that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.

The prototype aimed to create a CD-ROM add-on for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). However, due to disagreements and corporate conflicts between Sony and Nintendo, the project was ultimately abandoned, and very few prototypes are known to exist. Sony subsequently went on to develop the PlayStation, which became a major competitor in the video game console market. Given that the Nintendo PlayStation never saw a commercial release and no official games were produced specifically for it, running a \\"Super Mario CD\\" on the original hardware is not possible in the conventional sense, as such a game does not exist. Most of what is known about the device comes from the discovery of these prototypes years after the project's cancellation. However, if you're referring to running a hypothetical or fan-made \\"Super Mario CD\\" game on one of the existing Nintendo PlayStation prototypes or via emulation, here's a general idea of what that process might entail: 1. **Find a Suitable Game**: Since official games for the Nintendo PlayStation don't exist, any game you'd want to run would have to be a homebrew or fan creation designed to work with an emulator or specifically crafted to run on the prototype hardware. 2. **Using Prototypes**: If you somehow have access to one of the rare Nintendo PlayStation prototypes, you would need specialized knowledge to create or port software for it. This would likely involve reverse engineering and custom development since there's very limited documentation on the system's architecture or development tools. 3. **Emulation**: An easier and more feasible approach would be to use emulation. There might be emulators designed to mimic the speculated capabilities of the Nintendo PlayStation, or you might utilize SNES emulators combined with CD-ROM functionality to simulate the experience. You would load the homebrew game into the emulator as you would with any other game ROM. 4. **Homebrew Development**: If you're developing a homebrew game with the intent to run it as a \\"Super Mario CD\\" on this conjectural platform, you’d have to understand the hardware limitations speculated for the Nintendo PlayStation and perhaps use SNES development tools while adding CD-ROM capabilities. This is purely speculative and for entertainment or academic purposes. Remember, the use of ROMs (including homebrew games) and emulators is a legal grey area and intellectual property laws apply. Always respect copyright laws and only use software you legally own or have permission to use. In summary, running a \\"Super Mario CD\\" on the Nintendo PlayStation is not something that can be done with an official game or console, since neither were commercially released. Any attempt to do so would be purely in the realm of emulation or speculative homebrew development."},{"prompt":"I was just asking (really I don't have the copy of the game)","completion":"Understood!

If you're interested in gaming history, this subject is a fascinating \\"what could have been\\" scenario that shows how close the gaming world came to having a significantly different landscape. It's amazing to see how these early collaborations and disputes helped shape the direction of major companies like Sony and Nintendo in the decades that followed."},{"prompt":"Write a scene while Luke is training Jacen and Jaina, Luke says \\"One very important thing about being a Jedi, you must resist the Dark Side\\"","completion":"The sun was setting over the training grounds as Luke Skywalker stood before his young students, Jacen and Jaina Solo.

The revelation hit them like a thunderbolt, shattering their illusions about their family history. \\"Darth Vader?\\" Jacen finally spoke, his voice barely a whisper. \\"But...but how could he have turned to the Dark Side? How could he have become such a monster?\\" Luke looked away, his eyes clouded with pain. \\"Anakin was seduced by the power of the Dark Side,\\" he explained. \\"He was consumed by fear and anger, and he lost himself to the darkness. It was a tragic fall from grace, one that cost him everything he held dear.\\" Jacen and Jaina were silent, their minds reeling from the revelation. They struggled to reconcile the image of the heroic Jedi Knight they had heard stories about with the twisted figure of Darth Vader. \\"Remember, my young Padawans,\\" Luke continued, his voice filled with a mix of sadness and determination, \\"that even the strongest of Jedi can be tempted by the Dark Side. It is a constant battle, one that we must fight every day to stay true to the light.\\" Jacen and Jaina nodded slowly, their resolve hardening as they took in the lesson that Luke had imparted. They knew now that the struggle against the Dark Side was not just a distant danger, but a very real threat that they would have to face in their own journey as Jedi.

Firstly, when companies found that their national markets had become saturated, they realized that they could only increase profits by setting up subsidiaries abroad. Secondly, if a country set up trade barriers - usually tariffs or quotas against a company's products, then the only alternative for the company was to establish a factory or sales organization in the country concerned. - More recently, the economic boom of the 1960s led to a rapid growth of globe-trotting enterprises. In the highly industrialized countries rising incomes attracted the multinationals; in the developing countries, the availability of cheap labour lured many companies into building new factories and assembly plants.","completion":"MULTINATIONALS The term \\"multinational\\" is used for a company which has subsidiaries or sales facilities throughout the world. شرکت‌های چندملیتی عبارت «چندملیتی» برای شرکتی به کار می‌رود که دارای زیرمجموعه‌ها یا تأسیسات فروش در سراسر جهان است. Another expression for this type of business enterprise is \\"global corporation\\". یک اصطلاح دیگر برای این نوع فعالیت تجاری «شرکت جهانی» است. Many of these giant organizations are household names such as Coca Cola, Heinz, Sony, Hitachi, IBM, Akzo, and General Motors. بسیاری از این سازمان‌های غول‌پیکر، نام‌های آشنایی مانند کوکاکولا، هاینز، سونی، هیتاچی، آی‌بی‌ام، آکزو، و جنرال موتورز هستند.

Looking back into history, we can find two main reasons for the development of multinationals. با نگاهی به تاریخ، می‌توانیم دو دلیل اصلی برای توسعه شرکت‌های چندملیتی پیدا کنیم. Firstly, when companies found that their national markets had become saturated, they realized that they could only increase profits by setting up subsidiaries abroad. اولاً، وقتی شرکت‌ها متوجه شدند که بازارهای ملی آن‌ها اشباع شده است، دریافتند که تنها راه افزایش سودها، تأسیس زیرمجموعه‌ها در خارج از کشور است. Secondly, if a country set up trade barriers - usually tariffs or quotas against a company's products, then the only alternative for the company was to establish a factory or sales organization in the country concerned. ثانیاً، اگر کشوری موانع تجاری - معمولاً تعرفه‌ها یا سهمیه‌ها علیه محصولات یک شرکت - ایجاد کند، تنها جایگزین برای آن شرکت، تأسیس کارخانه یا سازمان فروش در کشور مربوطه بود. More recently, the economic boom of the 1960s led to a rapid growth of globe-trotting enterprises. اخیراً، رونق اقتصادی دهه 1960 منجر به رشد سریع کسب‌وکارهایی شد که در سراسر جهان فعالیت دارند. In the highly industrialized countries, rising incomes attracted the multinationals; in the developing countries, the availability of cheap labour lured many companies into building new factories and assembly plants. در کشورهای بسیار صنعتی‌شده، افزایش درآمدها شرکت‌های چندملیتی را جذب کرد؛ در کشورهای در حال توسعه، دسترسی به نیروی کار ارزان، بسیاری از شرکت‌ها را به ساخت کارخانه‌ها و مجتمع‌های مونتاژ جدید ترغیب کرد."},{"prompt":"2.2.3. Consequences of a Breach of Conventional Rule Various consequences may follow the breach of non-legal rules of the constitution. Loss of office or departure from public life would be the severest consequence, but the force of public opinion or political controversy may simply force the offender to think again: thus the Scottish judge who in 1968 joined a committee established by the Conservative Party decided to resign rather than prejudice the work of the committee. In these instances, the outcome reinforces the established rule. A less serious consequence would be a reprimand or a reminder not to act similarly in the future, given by someone in a position to enforce the rule. In November 1974, for instance, the British Prime Minister reprimanded 3 leading ministers who had supported a motion passed by the National Executive of the Labour Party sharply criticising the Government's policy on South Africa. If no adverse consequences follow, the matter becomes more open. Is it simply that it was politically expedient that, for example, the Prime Minister should turn a blind eye to the acts of his colleagues, or has the application of the rule been modified or the rule itself abandoned? As conventional rules often give rise to reciprocal obligations, one consequence of a breach may be to release another office-holder from the normal constrains that would otherwise bind him. For example, when Smith the Prime Minister of Rhodesia (as it was known), unilaterally declared Rhodesia's independence, the immediate response of the British Government, conveyed through the Governor General of Rhodesia, was the dismissal of the entire Cabinet. In the event this dismissal proved purely nominal. Somewhat more significantly, the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965 was passed by the British Parliament to give the Government full power to legislate for the domestic affairs of Rhodesia, thus overriding the previous convention that the British Parliament would not exercise its sovereignty in such matters except with the agreement of the Rhodesian Government. Another consequence may be the passing of legislation to avoid a similar breach in the future. When in 1909 the House of Lords in Britain rejected the Government's Finance Bill, the crisis was resolved only by the Parliament Act 1911, which removed the power of the Lords to veto or delay money Bills. The 1911 Act contained other provisions intended to place the relationship between the Two Houses of Parliament - the House of Lords and the House of Commons - on a new footing.

For example, when Smith the Prime Minister of Rhodesia (as it was known), unilaterally declared Rhodesia's independence, the immediate response of the British Government, conveyed through the Governor General of Rhodesia, was the dismissal of the entire Cabinet. برای مثال، وقتی اسمیت نخست وزیر رودزیا (همانطور که شناخته می‌شد)، به طور یکجانبه استقلال رودزیا را اعلام کرد، واکنش فوری دولت بریتانیا که از طریق فرماندار کل رودزیا منتقل شد، اخراج کل کابینه بود.

The 1911 Act contained other provisions intended to place the relationship between the Two Houses of Parliament - the House of Lords and the House of Commons - on a new footing. قانون ۱۹۱۱ حاوی مقررات دیگری بود که قصد داشت رابطه بین دو مجلس پارلمان - مجلس لردها و مجلس عوام - را بر پایه‌ای نو قرار دهد.

Criminal Proceedings A definite distinction can be made between criminal and civil proceedings. In relation to the more serious offences, at least, a criminal case will involve a judge and jury, whereas in a civil action, the judge will normally sit alone. There is a presumption, in a criminal trial, that the accused person is innocent, and it is the task of his prosecutors to produce evidence which convinces the jury of his guilt \\"beyond all reasonable doubt\\". No such presumption exists in civil actions, the burden of proof being to establish one's case \\"on the balance of probabilitics\\". 4. Punishment Whereas the outcome of a successful action is normally the award of damages, a successful prosecution normally results in punishment. This may involve imprisonment, a fine, probation, or a combination of these. A prison sentence may be \\"suspended\\", or the accused may be discharged either absolutely, or conditionally, upon good behaviour. Whilst these are not exactly \\"let-offs\\", they do seem to depart from the traditional notion of punishment.

Mushrooms require a humid environment to grow. Ensure you're misting the mushrooms enough so that the environment is consistently moist but not soaking wet. Insufficient misting can lead to dry conditions that inhibit mushroom growth. 2. **Temperature**: Check if the temperature of the room where you're growing the mushrooms is optimal. Chestnut mushrooms typically grow best in temperatures ranging from 18°C to 24°C (64°F to 75°F). If the environment is too cold or too hot, the mushrooms may not grow. 3. **Lighting**: While mushrooms don't require as much light as plants do, they still need some indirect light to grow. Ensure your setup is in an area where it can receive indirect sunlight or fluorescent light. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can dry out the mushrooms and the substrate. 4. **Air Circulation**: Good air circulation is essential for preventing mold and bacteria growth, which can negatively impact your mushroom crop. If your setup is in a location with poor air circulation, consider moving it or using a small fan to improve airflow (while being careful not to dry out the environment). 5. **Contamination**: If you notice any unusual colors (like green, black, or orange) on the substrate or developing mushrooms, it could be a sign of contamination. Contaminated kits usually cannot be saved and should be disposed of to prevent the spread of contaminants. 6. **Patience**: Sometimes, mushrooms take a little longer to start growing depending on their conditions. If you've only recently set up your kit and it's been less than 10 days, give it a bit more time. If you've double-checked all these factors and your mushrooms still aren't growing, it might be worth reaching out to Fungi Farms for specific advice about their kits. They may be able to provide additional troubleshooting tips or replace the kit if it was defective. Remember, mushroom growing can be a bit of trial and error, and each batch can vary due to numerous environmental factors."},{"prompt":"how much misting should i do?","completion":"The amount of misting required for a mushroom grow kit can vary based on several environmental factors, including the ambient humidity and temperature of the room, the type of mushrooms you're growing, and the specific substrate used in your kit. However, there are general guidelines you can follow to ensure your mushrooms have the moisture they need to grow properly. For a chestnut mushroom grow kit like the one you've described, Jake's instructions suggest a \\"generous misting\\" through the opening at the top two to three times per day. Here's how to interpret and adjust that guidance: 1. **Consistent Moisture**: The goal of misting is to keep the substrate consistently moist, but not waterlogged. The surface should feel damp to the touch. 2. **Two to Three Times Daily**: This is a starting point. If you're in a particularly dry environment or if your home has heating or air conditioning that dries the air, you may need to increase the frequency of misting to maintain the right humidity levels. 3. **Observation is Key**: Monitor the surface of the substrate and the mushrooms as they begin to grow. If you notice the surface appears dry or the mushrooms' edges become wrinkled or crispy, it's a sign they need more moisture, and you should mist more frequently. Conversely, if you notice standing water or the substrate looks soggy, reduce the amount or frequency of misting. 4. **Adjust According to Growth Stage**: Young, developing mushrooms (pins) need a high humidity environment to develop properly. As they grow larger, you can slightly reduce the frequency of misting, but always ensure the environment remains moist. 5. **Use a Fine Mist**: When misting, use a spray bottle that emits a fine mist to avoid dislodging or damaging the young mushrooms. Direct the mist above the mushrooms and let it fall onto them, rather than spraying directly at the substrate with force. 6. **Humidity Tent**: With your kit's setup, where you create a humidity dome using a plastic bag, ensure there's some air exchange to prevent mold growth. Slightly opening the bag or creating small holes can help, but maintain high humidity inside the dome. Remember, every mushroom grow kit can perform a bit differently based on conditions in your home, so observation and adjustment are crucial. If you're not seeing the growth you expect, consider adjusting the amount of misting first, along with verifying the other cultivation conditions like temperature and light."},{"prompt":"the kit has some slight blackish orange stuff","completion":"The appearance of blackish-orange stuff on your mushroom grow kit could indicate contamination, which is not uncommon in mushroom cultivation. Contamination can occur from mold or bacteria and can hinder the growth of your mushrooms or potentially spoil the entire substrate. Here's how to assess and possibly manage this situation: # Identifying the Contamination 1. **Color and Texture**: Typically, healthy mycelium (the vegetative part of the fungus that produces mushrooms) appears white and somewhat fluffy or stringy. Black, orange, or any other brightly colored spots could be a sign of mold or bacterial contamination. Orange could specifically suggest a type of mold, while black might indicate either mold spores or another type of fungal growth that is not part of your intended mushroom crop. 2. **Location and Spread**: Note where the contamination is appearing. Is it on the surface, within the substrate, or on the mushrooms themselves? Contaminants spreading rapidly or covering a large area are more concerning. # Managing Contamination 1. **Isolation**: If possible, separate the contaminated kit from any other mushroom projects or susceptible plants to prevent the spread of spores or bacteria. 2. **Assessment**: Small, localized spots of contamination might sometimes be managed by carefully removing the affected area with a clean, sterilized instrument. However, this is often not recommended for beginners because it can spread the contamination further if not done correctly. 3. **Disposal**: If the contamination is widespread or if removing the affected areas is not feasible, it's usually best to dispose of the entire kit to prevent any risk of spreading the contaminants. Do not compost it, as this could spread contamination to your compost pile. Seal it in a plastic bag before disposing of it to contain any spores. 4. **Prevention for Future Kits**: Review your sterilization and hygiene practices. Ensure your workspace, tools, and hands are clean before handling the kit. Keep the growing area well-ventilated and at the correct humidity and temperature levels to discourage unwanted fungal or bacterial growth. Avoid opening the kit or the humidity dome more than necessary to reduce exposure to airborne contaminants. # After Disposal - **Clean Up**: Clean and disinfect the area where you kept the contaminated mushroom kit. Use a solution of water and bleach or a disinfectant to wipe down surfaces. - **Consider Restarting**: If you're still interested in growing mushrooms, don't be discouraged. Contamination is a common hurdle in mushroom cultivation, and learning how to prevent it is part of the process. Since fungi and bacteria are part of the natural environment, some risk of contamination always exists in mushroom cultivation. However, with careful practice and by maintaining a clean growing environment, you can minimize these risks and enjoy growing mushrooms. If in doubt about the state of your kit, it's a good practice to reach out to the supplier for advice. Fungi Farms or another experienced mushroom grower could offer specific insights or support based on their experience."},{"prompt":"Me diga pinturas, cujo apresentam 3 figuras femininas de corpos exageradamente avantajados","completion":"Não existem muitas pinturas famosas que atendam exatamente a essa descrição, especialmente porque a ideia de \\"corpos exageradamente avantajados\\" pode variar muito dependendo do contexto cultural e da época.

Aqui estão algumas obras e artistas que, de alguma maneira, podem se alinhar ao que você busca, levando em consideração interpretações mais amplas: 1. **Peter Paul Rubens:** Rubens é talvez o exemplo mais emblemático de um artista que exaltava formas femininas mais volumosas. Sua obra é repleta de figuras femininas com corpos volumosos, embora não focasse exclusivamente em grupos de três mulheres. Algumas de suas pinturas que exibem mulheres em diferentes composições, muitas vezes mitológicas, incluem \\"O Julgamento de Paris\\" e \\"As Três Graças\\". - **\\"O Julgamento de Paris\\"** pode apresentar três deusas (Hera, Afrodite e Atena) com corpos bastante idealizados, ainda que não sejam \\"exageradamente avantajados\\" pelos padrões modernos. - **\\"As Três Graças\\"** é talvez uma das mais famosas, mostrando três mulheres nuas em um complexo abraço. Suas formas são arredondadas e plenas, mas, novamente, diferem bastante da noção contemporânea de corporalidade exagerada. 2. **Fernando Botero:** Botero é um artista moderno colombiano conhecido por seu estilo \\"Boterismo\\", caracterizado por figuras volumosas e uma forma de exagero muito distinta. Suas obras muitas vezes retratam figuras humanas com proporções ampliadas, o que poderia ser interpretado como \\"corpos exageradamente avantajados\\". Embora suas obras muitas vezes apresentem figuras individuais, há composições com grupos de pessoas que podem se alinhar à sua busca, embora encontrar uma obra específica com exatamente três figuras femininas possa exigir uma pesquisa mais aprofundada na variedade de sua produção. 3. **\\"As Mulheres de Argel\\" (Les Femmes d'Alger) de Pablo Picasso:** Esta série de pinturas de Picasso, inspirada em parte por \\"O Harém\\" de Eugène Delacroix, não necessariamente apresenta figuras com \\"corpos exageradamente avantajados\\" no sentido usual. No entanto, algumas obras dentro desta série mostram formas femininas de maneira estilizada e robusta, embora a ênfase esteja mais na abstração e na composição do que na voluptuosidade per se. Esses exemplos variam amplamente em estilos e épocas, o que destaca como o conceito de beleza e a representação do corpo feminino têm mudado ao longo do tempo.

The choice of a hill fort as a setting not only provides a scenic backdrop but also invites diners to take a step back in time. **Design:** As guests walk through the fort's gates, they are greeted by a canvas-covered courtyard, offering a protective shield while still allowing the area to bask in natural light during the day and turning into a cozy, ambient space at night with strategic lighting. The use of canvas suggests a synergy with nature, reminiscent of royal encampments of yore. Bench-style tables encourage communal dining and interaction among guests, fostering a convivial atmosphere. # Culinary Experience **Cuisine:** Inspired by the vast and vibrant tapestry of Indian cuisine, the menu would celebrate the diversity and richness of flavors that Indian food is known for. From the spicy tang of street-style chaats to the robust flavors of tandoori items and the subtle elegance of Mughlai cuisine, the offerings could span the length and breadth of the country’s culinary heritage. **Presentation:** Given the colorful aspect of Indian cuisine, presentation would be key. Traditional brass and copper utensils could add an authentic touch, while modern plating techniques might be employed to appeal to a broader audience seeking Instagram-worthy dining moments. **Spices and Ingredients:** Emphasizing authenticity and flavor, dishes would utilize a wide array of spices, not just for heat but for depth and aroma. The use of locally sourced ingredients, alongside specific imports like saffron or black cardamom, could ensure sustainability without compromising on the authentic taste. # Guest Experience **Interactive Elements:** To enhance the dining experience, guests could be invited to participate in or witness live cooking demonstrations, perhaps around a traditional sigdi (a type of coal stove) or tandoor. This interaction adds an educational layer to the meal, engaging guests and providing deeper insight into the culinary techniques behind their food. **Cultural Embedment:** Beyond food, the overall experience could be enriched by integrating elements of Indian culture. This might include traditional music performances, showcasing classical dances, or even hosting mini workshops on topics like spice blending or chai making. **Sustainability:** In keeping with current trends and demands for responsible consumption, the dining concept could emphasize sustainability not only in food sourcing but in its operations – from biodegradable utensils and zero plastic policy to water conservation measures. # Marketing and Communal Engagement **Storytelling:** The restaurant’s marketing strategy could revolve around storytelling, highlighting the history of the hill fort, the origins of the recipes, and the journey of ingredients from farm to table. This narrative approach could help build a strong emotional connection with guests. **Community Building:** Hosting events such as local food festivals, supporting local artisans by displaying and selling their crafts, or running monthly culinary excursions to explore regional cuisine could foster a sense of community and make the restaurant a center for cultural exchange. With thoughtful execution, this dining concept could offer guests not just a meal, but a passage through time and tradition, leaving them with a deeper appreciation for Indian culture and cuisine."},{"prompt":"Could the gates and copurtyard approach be used for other regions?

Making coconut burfi, a popular Indian sweet, can be easily understood by breaking it down to its core principles and components. Essentially, it's about understanding the chemistry and physical changes of the ingredients as they are mixed and cooked together. Let's embark on this culinary journey from a first principles perspective: # Ingredients: 1. **Coconut**: Freshly grated coconut is preferred because it provides the foundational texture and flavor. 2. **Sugar**: Acts as the sweetener and, when cooked, contributes to the structural integrity of the burfi by creating a syrup that binds the coconut. 3. **Milk**: Adds richness and helps in binding the ingredients together. Some recipes use condensed milk which already includes sugar, reducing the need for additional sugar. 4. **Cardamom Powder**: Adds fragrance and flavor, enhancing the overall taste. 5. **Ghee (Clarified Butter)**: Used to grease the tray and also added to the mix for richness and a smooth texture. 6. **Optional**: Nuts like cashews or pistachios for garnishing, which add a textural contrast and visual appeal. # Tools Needed: - A heavy-bottomed pan or skillet - A wooden spoon or spatula - A tray or dish to set the burfi - Parchment paper or greased plate for easy removal # The Process: **1. Understand Your Ingredients:** - **Coconut**: Fresh coconut has less moisture than desiccated coconut, crucial for the final texture. Too much moisture can make the burfi too soft. - **Sugar**: Melting sugar forms a syrup that when cooled, hardens. The concentration of this syrup will affect the texture of the burfi. - **Milk**: Its role is twofold; it adds flavor and helps in dissolving the sugar. If using condensed milk, it will significantly sweeten the mixture. **2. Cooking Science:** - **Starting**: Begin by lightly frying the grated coconut in a bit of ghee. This process, known as sautéing, enhances the coconut's flavor by gently cooking it and allowing it to release its oils. - **Sugar Syrup**: Adding sugar to the mix transforms the texture. As the sugar dissolves in milk and heats up, it undergoes caramelization at higher temperatures, adding depth to the flavor. - **Evaporation**: Cooking the mixture involves evaporating the moisture content, which is critical. The objective is to reach a consistency where the mixture is moist enough to bind yet dry enough to set into a solid form. It's a delicate balance - too much moisture and the burfi won't set properly; too little, and it could become crumbly. - **Cooling and Setting**: Once the mixture reaches the desired consistency, it's spread onto a greased plate or tray and allowed to cool. As it cools, the sugar crystallizes further, helping to set the burfi into a solid, sliceable form. # Step-by-Step Guide: 1. **Prepare Ingredients**: Measure out approximately 2 cups of grated coconut, 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of milk (or 1 cup condensed milk, reducing or eliminating the additional sugar), a teaspoon of cardamom powder, and a tablespoon of ghee. 2. **Cooking**: In a heavy-bottomed pan, melt a tablespoon of ghee and lightly sauté the grated coconut for about a minute on medium heat. Add milk and sugar, stirring constantly to prevent sticking. Over medium flame, cook the mixture until it thickens. This might take around 15-20 minutes. Stir in the cardamom powder. 3. **Testing Consistency**: You can test if the mixture is ready by taking a small portion and cooling it slightly; it should form a soft ball. 4. **Setting the Burfi**: Pour the thickened mixture into a greased or parchment paper-lined tray. Flatten the surface with a spatula or the back of a spoon. Optionally, garnish with chopped nuts. 5. **Cooling and Cutting**: Allow the mixture to cool completely at room temperature. Once set, cut into squares or diamonds. Understanding the chemistry behind the ingredients and their reactions, particularly the caramelization of sugar and the evaporation of moisture to reach the right consistency, is key to making coconut burfi. This approach, grounded in first principles, empowers you to adapt and innovate over time, whether it's tweaking the flavor, modifying the texture, or experimenting with additions."},{"prompt":"List the variations","completion":"Coconut burfi, with its simplistic elegance, is a versatile sweet that can be adapted in numerous ways. By tweaking the base ingredients or adding new elements, one can create an array of delightful variations. Here's a list of popular and creative takes on the traditional coconut burfi: # 1. **Milk Coconut Burfi** Incorporate full-fat milk or condensed milk to add richness. This version focuses more on the creamy texture and often uses less sugar since condensed milk is already sweet. # 2. **Chocolate Coconut Burfi** By adding cocoa powder or melted chocolate into the mixture, or layering it with chocolate, you can make a dessert that appeals to both coconut and chocolate lovers. The contrasting flavors make this a hit, especially with children. # 3. **Mango Coconut Burfi** This variation involves adding mango pulp to the coconut mixture, introducing a fruity, tangy flavor perfect for summer. The natural sweetness of mango can also help in reducing added sugar. # 4. **Rose Coconut Burfi** Infusing the burfi with rose water or layering it with rose-flavored cream brings in a fragrant, floral note that is incredibly refreshing. This version is often garnished with dried rose petals. # 5. **Saffron Coconut Burfi** Incorporating saffron soaked in warm milk into the burfi mixture adds a luxurious aroma and a beautiful color. Saffron introduces a unique, refined taste that elevates the simple coconut burfi to something more exotic. # 6. **Pistachio Coconut Burfi** By mixing finely chopped pistachios into the burfi mixture or using them as a garnish, this variation not only adds a pop of color but also introduces a nutty texture and flavor that complements the coconut beautifully. # 7. **Almond Coconut Burfi** Similar to pistachio, adding ground almonds or almond slivers to the mix or as a topping adds depth to the flavor profile and provides a crunchy texture contrasting the soft burfi. # 8. **Cardamom and Saffron Coconut Burfi** A combination of cardamom and saffron, this variation is rich in aroma and flavor. The two spices are often used in Indian sweets and give the coconut burfi a traditional and festive touch. # 9. **Orange Coconut Burfi** Incorporating orange zest and a bit of juice can bring a refreshing citrus twist to the coconut burfi. This variation is particularly appealing for its fresh, zesty flavor that cuts through the sweetness. # 10. **Coffee Coconut Burfi** Adding instant coffee powder or espresso to the mixture introduces a bitter note that balances the sweetness and adds an interesting flavor profile for coffee lovers. # 11. **Multi-Layered Burfi** Creating layers with different flavors or colors can make the coconut burfi visually appealing and more interesting in terms of taste. For example, a layer of plain coconut burfi topped with a chocolate layer, or alternating colors by adding food coloring. # 12. **Vegan Coconut Burfi** Replacing dairy elements with vegan alternatives like coconut milk or almond milk and using plant-based sweeteners can cater to vegan dietary preferences without compromising on taste. Each variation allows for personalization and experimentation, making coconut burfi a versatile sweet adaptable to different occasions, tastes, and dietary needs. Whether sticking to the traditional recipe or exploring these variations, coconut burfi remains a delightful treat that's both easy to make and enjoy."},{"prompt":"Can I add khoya to the burfi?","completion":"Yes, you can definitely add khoya (also known as mawa) to coconut burfi, and doing so is actually a popular variation that adds richness, creaminess, and a melt-in-the-mouth texture to the sweet. Khoya is a dairy product made by slowly simmering milk until much of its moisture content has evaporated, leaving behind milk solids. In sweets and desserts, it contributes a dense, creamy consistency as well as a deep, concentrated milk flavor. # How to Incorporate Khoya into Coconut Burfi: Here’s a basic guideline on how to include khoya into your coconut burfi recipe: Ingredients: - 1 cup Grated Fresh Coconut - 1/2 to 3/4 cup Khoya (crumbled or grated) - 1/2 to 3/4 cup Sugar (adjust based on your sweetness preference and the sweetness of the khoya) - 1/2 cup Milk (optional, depending on the moisture content of your coconut and khoya) - 1-2 tablespoons Ghee - Cardamom Powder to taste - Nuts for garnishing (optional) Steps: 1. **Preparation:** First, ensure the khoya is at room temperature and crumbled or grated, so it integrates evenly into the mixture. If you're using freshly grated coconut, make sure it is finely grated to match the texture of the khoya. 2. **Start the Mixture:** In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat a tablespoon of ghee. Add the grated coconut and sauté it for a couple of minutes on low heat just until it releases its aroma. Be careful not to brown the coconut. 3. **Add Khoya and Sugar:** Introduce the crumbled khoya to the pan along with the sugar. If using, pour in the milk as well. The mixture should be cooked on a medium flame. Keep stirring to prevent the mixture from sticking to the bottom and to ensure even cooking. 4. **Cook to Desired Consistency:** Continue cooking while stirring often until the khoya melts, the sugar dissolves completely, and the mixture thickens. It should start leaving the sides of the pan, indicating that it is nearing readiness. 5. **Flavoring:** Sprinkle some cardamom powder over the mixture for that fragrant, traditional flavor. Stir well to distribute the spice evenly throughout. 6. **Setting the Burfi:** Transfer the cooked mixture to a greased plate or tray. Flatten and smooth the top with a spatula or a flat spoon. If desired, garnish with chopped nuts like almonds, pistachios, or cashews while it’s still warm. 7. **Cool and Cut:** Allow the burfi to cool down completely to room temperature before cutting it into squares or diamond shapes with a sharp knife. Tips: - **Adjust Sugar:** Since khoya also has a natural sweetness, you may want to adjust the amount of added sugar based on your taste preferences and the sweetness of your khoya. - **Moisture Content:** If your khoya and coconut are both very dry, adding a little milk can help in cooking the mixture to the right consistency without it drying out. However, too much liquid will increase the setting time and could potentially make the burfi too soft. By adding khoya to your coconut burfi, you elevate the simple coconut treat into a decadent, rich sweet that’s perfect for special occasions and festivals. Experiment with the quantities to find the perfect balance that suits your taste."},{"prompt":"Alkoholos hőmérőnk kapillárisának átmérője 1 mm.

Az alkohol térfogati hőtágulási együtthatója (β) azt mutatja, hogy az alkohol térfogata egységnyi térfogatra és egységnyi hőmérsékletváltozásra milyen arányban növekszik. Ez esetben β = 1.1×10^(-4) 1/°C. A kapilláris átmérője 1 mm, ami 0.001 méternek felel meg. A hőmérsékletváltozás ΔT = 20 °C - 10 °C = 10 °C. Az emelkedés magassága, melyet a feladat megad, Δh = 3 cm = 0.03 méter. Először is kiszámoljuk a kapillárisban lévő alkohol térfogatváltozását (ΔV), amit a hőmérséklet emelkedése okoz: ΔV = π * (d/2)^2 * Δh, ahol d a kapilláris átmérője. Beszúrva az adatokat: ΔV = π * (0.001/2)^2 * 0.03 ≈ 2.36 * 10^(-8) m^3. Ezután használjuk az alkohol térfogatának hőtágulási képletét, amely így néz ki: ΔV = V_0 * β * ΔT, ahol V_0 az alkohol kezdeti térfogata, β az alkohol térfogati hőtágulási együtthatója, és ΔT a hőmérsékletváltozás. Ezt az egyenletet átrendezve V_0-ra: V_0 = ΔV / (β * ΔT) Beszúrva az adatokat: V_0 = (2.36 * 10^(-8) m^3) / ((1.1 * 10^(-4) 1/°C) * 10 °C) ≈ 2.15 * 10^(-5) m^3 = 21.5 cm^3.

Ela parou, virando-se para olhar o imponente imperador demoníaco por trás de si. Malakai já estava seguindo a há meses, permanecendo como uma sombra e observando cada movimento da samurai. Apesar de seu poder imenso, havia algo na determinação férrea de Arya que fascinava o Supremo Soberano. “Ainda está me seguindo, Kailus?\\" Arya perguntou, a voz carregada de um cansaço que ela não permitia que seu corpo demonstrasse. Malakai surgiu das sombras, a neve ao seu redor parecendo recuar diante de sua presença. \\"Arya,\\" ele começou, com um tom que misturava diversão e um leve traço de desdém, \\"eu criei as estrelas, as marés e as chamas da vida. Você acha realmente que deixaria de seguir a única criatura que conseguiu me desafiar, a única que me faz questionar o propósito da minha própria existência?\\" Arya franziu o cenho, sua expressão revelando uma ponta de respeito relutante. “Calado. Me ajude a apanhar galhos para a fogueira, ou vá embora.” Ela voltou-se, ignorando a figura imponente de Malakai, e começou a catar galhos quebradiços sob a neve. Malakai observou-a por um momento, um sorriso indecifrável pairando em seus lábios antes de se mover para ajudá-la. Havia uma harmonia estranha entre eles, uma dança de sombras e luz onde o poderoso Supremo Soberano se rendia à simplicidade de ajudar a samurai na tarefa mundana. “Kai. Espere. Está sentindo esse cheiro?” A expressão de Malakai endureceu enquanto ele aspirava o ar frio da noite, sua postura antes relaxada agora tensa e alerta. O cheiro metálico de sangue fresco misturava-se com o aroma congelante da neve, um claro indicativo de perigo próximo. \\"É sangue,\\" ele murmurou, sua voz um rosnado baixo. Sem hesitar, Arya puxou sua katana, os olhos varrendo o horizonte por sinais de movimento. Arya avançou cautelosa entre as árvores desnudas, a neve estalando sob seus pés. Ao chegar ao local, seus olhos captaram a cena de desolação: uma carruagem tombada com suas rodas apontando para o céu noturno e corpos de soldados espalhados no solo gelado, suas roupas manchadas com o escarlate da vida que já não possuíam. A frieza da noite parecia agora ainda mais profunda, refletindo o silêncio da morte que ali se abatera. “Kailus…” Ela rosnou. “Não olhe para mim. Eu não tenho nada a ver com isso,” Malakai respondeu, a voz repleta de um desdém frio. “Esses são os humanos, com suas guerras e disputas mesquinhas.” Ele se agachou ao lado de um corpo, examinando-o com um olhar crítico. “As roupas são muito ruins para serem de algum nobre. Provavelmente, soldados de alguma aldeia pequena.” Levantou-se, limpo de qualquer culpa, um espectro de alguém que já tinha visto tais cenas inúmeras vezes. “Erick… estou com medo.” A voz trêmula veio de trás da carruagem, uma jovem mulher surgiu, agarrando o braço de um homem ferido. Seus olhos, grandes e temerosos, fixavam-se em Arya e Malakai. O homem, um soldado com a armadura destroçada, tentava se manter firme, mas as pernas mal o sustentavam. \\"Ajude-nos, por favor,\\" implorou a mulher, os cabelos desgrenhados emoldurando seu rosto pálido. Arya olhou para Malakai antes de se aproximar, a katana ainda em punho, pronta para enfrentar o que quer que tivesse causado aquela carnificina. “Quem são vocês?” Malakai observava a cena com uma curiosidade desapegada, como se as vidas humanas à sua frente fossem apenas peças em algum jogo esquecido. Ele aguardava a resposta, talvez para decidir se interviria ou se simplesmente se voltaria para as sombras de onde tinha vindo. Erick tossiu, o sangue manchando seus lábios enquanto ele lutava para falar. \\"Meu nome é Erik, e esta é Lyanna,\\" disse ele, com a voz rouca de dor. \\"Somos de uma vila não muito distante, chamada Avilla.\\" Ele fez uma pausa para respirar, cada fôlego parecendo consumir o que lhe restava de força. \\"Estávamos escoltando Lyanna para o reino de Askov, onde ela se casaria com o príncipe Ivan, mas fomos emboscados por mercenários. Eles nos atacaram sem aviso, roubam tudo. Apesar de nossos melhores esforços, foram implacáveis.\\" A testa de Erik estava coberta de suor frio, e seus olhos suplicantes buscavam qualquer sinal de compaixão em seus estranhos salvadores. “Tsk. Isso não tem nada a ver conosco. Arya, vamos.” Malakai estava visivelmente impaciente, pronto para descartar a situação como mais um evento trivial na existência humana. Mas Arya hesitou, o peso da própria busca por justiça tornando impossível ignorar o apelo por ajuda. Erick e Lyanna estavam vulneráveis, seus destinos pendurados por um fio tão fino quanto a borda afiada da katana de Arya. A samurai abaixou sua arma lentamente, o aço frio refletindo a luz da lua enquanto ela tomava sua decisão. “Kailus.” Era uma ordem simples, mas carregava o peso de uma aliança não dita entre eles. Malakai, o Supremo Soberano, com todo o seu poder e indiferença, encontrou-se diante de um dilema raro, provocado pela intensidade do olhar de Arya. \\"O que você está planejando, Arya?\\" Malakai perguntou, sua voz revelando uma ponta de interesse verdadeiro misturado com sua habitual arrogância. “Eu vou ajudar vocês a chegarem em segurança até o reino de Askov,\\" Arya afirmou, a determinação em sua voz tão afiada quanto a lâmina que ela carregava. Erick e Lyanna trocaram um olhar atônito, mal acreditando na oferta inesperada de auxílio. O soldado acenou com a cabeça, a gratidão evidente mesmo diante do esforço para se manter consciente. \\"Obrigado,\\" ele murmurou, o alívio momentâneo quebrando sua expressão dolorida. “O que? Arya, você não pode estar falando sério,” Malakai retrucou, a incredulidade tingindo sua voz. Ele caminhou até Arya, sua estatura dominando a cena. “Não é da sua conta, Kailus,” Arya respondeu sem rodeios, seus olhos fixos em Malakai, desafiando-o a contradizer sua decisão. “Eu faço o que eu achar certo.” “Você…” Malakai começou, a frustração evidente em seu rosto, antes de suspirar e passar a mão pelos cabelos prateados. “Farei isso por você, Arya. Mas não pense que isso se tornará um hábito.” “Obrigada…” Erick falou, querendo saber o nome deles. “Meu nome é Arya. E ele é…” Quando a luz da lua iluminou o rosto de Malakai, Erick e Lyanna reconheceram imediatamente aquela figura magnífica e aterradora. Eles se ajoelharam imediatamente, o medo e a reverência misturando-se em suas expressões. \\"Supremo Soberano Malakai,\\" eles murmuraram, suas vozes tremendo pela proximidade com a entidade que conheciam apenas por lendas e sussurros na escuridão da noite. Malakai olhou para eles, um brilho ambíguo em seus olhos vermelhos. “Levante-se,” ele ordenou, sua voz carregada de uma autoridade que não necessitava de qualquer reforço. Erick e Lyanna se levantaram, ainda abalados pela presença do ser mais poderoso que conheciam, mas reconfortados pela proteção que ele oferecia. Arya observava a cena, uma faísca de satisfação em seus olhos por ter convencido Malakai a ajudar. Ela sabia que a estrada para Askov seria longa e perigosa, e a presença de Malakai seria uma vantagem inestimável, ou uma constante irritação. Arya se aproximou da assustada Lyanna, removendo seu manto grosso e envolvendo-o em torno da jovem mulher. Lyanna, ainda trêmula pela presença de Malakai e pela brutalidade do ataque que haviam sofrido, aceitou o gesto com um aceno de cabeça agradecido. “Você precisa se manter aquecida,” disse Arya com uma voz suave que raramente usava. “A noite vai ser ainda mais fria.” Erick, observando a troca, sentiu um calor no peito, uma centelha de esperança em meio ao frio implacável. “Obrigado. Obrigado. Sorte nossa encontrar uma pessoa como você e... o Supremo Soberano.\\" Malakai virou as costas, parecendo impaciente com os agradecimentos e formalidades. \\"Não temos tempo para sentimentalismos,\\" ele interrompeu, \\"a noite não está mais segura do que antes e precisamos nos mover.\\" Erick e Lyanna assentiram, reconhecendo a urgência na voz do imperador. Arya começou a liderar o caminho, sua postura confiante cortando a tensão do grupo. Mesmo com a presença de Malakai, ela não deixou sua guarda baixar, cada sentido alerta para o perigo que possivelmente ainda os aguardava. Eles avistaram uma caverna e decidiram que seria um bom local para se abrigarem durante a noite. A entrada era espaçosa o suficiente para que todos pudessem entrar sem se agachar, e o interior se estendia na escuridão, prometendo alguma proteção contra o vento cortante lá fora. Malakai entrou primeiro, os olhos vermelhos brilhando enquanto ele inspecionava o lugar. \\"Não é um palácio,\\" ele zombou, \\"mas vai servir.\\" Com cuidado, Arya ajudou Erick e Lyanna a se acomodarem no fundo da caverna. “Kailus. Fogo.” Era apenas um comando simples, mas suficiente para que Malakai, com um aceno de mão, conjurasse chamas em um pequeno fosso de pedras que Arya tinha arranjado. As labaredas iluminavam as paredes da caverna, lançando sombras dançantes que pareciam suavizar as feições duras de Malakai. Erick e Lyanna se aqueciam junto ao fogo, suas expressões cansadas, mas aliviadas por estarem vivos e sob a proteção de figuras tão poderosas e inesperadas. “Acho que tenho água e comida em minha bolsa,” Arya disse, revirando seus pertences. Ela retirou um pequeno pote de barro com água e um embrulho com alguns pães duros de viagem. “Está um pouco seco, mas vai matar a fome.” Erick conseguiu um sorriso fraco, acenando com a cabeça em gratidão. “Qualquer coisa é um banquete agora,” respondeu ele, aceitando a generosidade da samurai. Lyanna, ainda encolhida perto do fogo, olhou para Arya com olhos agradecidos. “Mas e você?” Arya olhou para o fundo da bolsa, vendo que não tinha mais nada. “Tudo bem. Não estou com fome agora,” ela respondeu, disfarçando a própria necessidade. Erick assentiu, compreendendo a fibra da pessoa que os havia salvado, e partilhou o pão com Lyanna. Ao comerem, o silêncio reinava, quebrado apenas pelo crepitar das chamas e pelo som abafado do vento lá fora. Malakai observava a cena, o fogo refletindo em seus olhos avermelhados, dando-lhe uma aparência quase humana. Quando Arya se levantou, ele seguia-a com o olhar, um misto de curiosidade e uma pontada de preocupação em sua expressão usualmente desdenhosa. \\"Vai aonde?\\" ele perguntou, a voz baixa o suficiente para não atrair a atenção de Erick e Lyanna. \\"Vou verificar a entrada,\\" Arya respondeu, segurando sua katana com firmeza. \\"Precisamos ter certeza de que estamos seguros aqui.\\" Malakai assentiu, levantando-se para acompanhá-la. Erick e Lyanna observaram enquanto os dois desapareciam na penumbra que antecedia a saída da caverna, as sombras dançantes do fogo tornando suas figuras quase etéreas. Arya e Malakai alcançaram a entrada da caverna, onde a luz do luar filtrava-se tenuemente através das nuvens carregadas de neve. Com a katana empunhada, Arya inspecionava cada canto, buscando sinais que denunciassem a presença de mais inimigos ou criaturas noturnas. Malakai tocou o braço de Arya levemente, sentindo o quão fria ela estava apesar de sua postura rígida. \\"Você deveria ter ficado com o manto,\\" ele disse, a preocupação rompendo a barreira de sua indiferença habitual. Arya deu de ombros, sua atenção ainda focada no exterior escuro e ameaçador. \\"Lyanna precisava mais dele,\\" respondeu ela simplesmente, como se o ato de generosidade fosse a coisa mais natural do mundo. \\"Mal os conhece e já está dando suas roupas e comida. Você é idiota ou o que?\\" Malakai provocou, embora o tom de sua voz tivesse traços de admiração. \\"Não é idiotice, Kailus,\\" Arya replicou, a voz firme. \\"É humanidade, algo que talvez você tenha esquecido ao longo dos séculos.\\" Houve um breve silêncio, durante o qual apenas o som suave da neve caindo podia ser ouvido. Malakai olhou para Arya, seus olhos vermelhos brilhando com uma intensidade incomum. “Se eles se tornarem um peso para você, o que você tenha que arriscar sua vida por eles… eu os matarei. Sem nem pensar duas vezes,” ele declarou, a voz destilando uma ameaça fria. Arya manteve o olhar fixo no horizonte noturno, a respiração tornando-se visível em pequenas nuvens de vapor. Por um instante, ela se perguntou se a frieza do imperador demoníaco seria capaz de rivalizar com o gelo que se acumulava ao seu redor. Ela sabia que Malakai não falava em vão, e a promessa de morte era tão real quanto o sangue que corria em suas veias. \\"Não precisará matá-los,\\" Arya disse finalmente, virando-se para enfrentá-lo. \\"Não vou deixar que se tornem um peso. Eu protejo aqueles com quem me importo, não importa o custo.\\" Malakai observou-a, o leve franzir de sua testa indicando uma rara confusão. \\"Eles mal conhecem você, e você mal os conhece. Por que se importa tanto?\\" sua voz era quase um sussurro, como se ele realmente desejasse entender. “EU PRECISO DISSO PARA ME LEMBRAR DE QUE AINDA SOU HUMANA, KAILUS!\\" Arya tapou a boca rapidamente, percebendo a intensidade de sua própria voz. A emoção borbulhava sob sua superfície calma, e o olhar em seus olhos era ardente, entregando a ferida aberta que era a memória do extermínio de seu clã. Tantos anos buscando vingança, matando sem hesitação aqueles que ficavam em seu caminho, Arya começou a sentir o peso de suas ações e a temer que o fio que a ligava à humanidade estivesse se desgastando. A preocupação de se tornar o que ela mais odiava a assombrava, e ajudar Erick e Lyanna oferecia uma tênue esperança de redenção, um antídoto para o veneno da vingança que corria em suas veias. “Ah… agora eu entendi. Não quer aceitar que está se tornando algo como eu.” Malakai inclinou a cabeça ligeiramente, um sorriso irônico tocando seus lábios enquanto observava a samurai. Arya desviou o olhar, focando novamente no vazio para além da entrada da caverna. As palavras dele, embora cruéis, tinham um fio de verdade que ela não podia ignorar. Arya temia a possibilidade de seus métodos e seu coração endurecido a transformarem em uma sombra do demônio que caminhava ao seu lado. \\"Eu nunca serei como você, Kailus,\\" Arya respondeu, a definição em sua voz era como o aço de sua katana. \\"Minhas ações têm propósito, não são caprichos de poder e tédio.\\" Malakai traçou uma unha negra pela linha da mandíbula dela, com um toque que poderia ser tão letal quanto carinhoso. \\"Você se agarra ao seu propósito como uma criança a uma manta, Arya,\\" ele murmurou, cada palavra carregada com um significado que apenas seres como ele poderiam compreender plenamente. \\"Mas eu vejo a verdade nos seus olhos. A batalha que você trava não é apenas contra aqueles que destruíram seu clã. É uma luta contra a escuridão que ameaça engolir sua alma.\\" Arya bateu na mão de Malakai, afastando-a de seu rosto com uma mistura de irritação e vulnerabilidade. “Eu sei muito bem com o que estou lutando,” ela disse, desafiando-o com a força de sua vontade. “Agora vamos voltar. Erick e Lyanna precisam de nós. E Kailus, não entre mais na minha cabeça. Não é seu lugar.” Malakai ergueu uma sobrancelha, o desafio de Arya despertando nele uma fascinação ainda maior pela complexidade humana. “Como quiser, Arya,” ele concedeu, o tom de sua voz misturando diversão e um respeito relutante. Eles retornaram ao calor da caverna, encontrando Erick e Lyanna aconchegados perto do fogo, a exaustão vencendo o medo e a tensão. Arya se sentou silenciosamente, sua katana sempre ao alcance, enquanto Malakai se recostava contra a parede rochosa, observando a interação humana com um olhar distante. Entediado, ele se aproximou da jovem Lyanna, que encolhia-se junto ao fogo, seus olhos arregalados e fixos nas chamas hipnóticas. Malakai observou-a por um momento, a curiosidade pueril de um ser antigo refletida em seus olhos vermelhos. “Quantos anos você tem?” Lyanna levantou os olhos para Malakai, seu olhar ainda carregado de um medo reverencial diante do ser poderoso à sua frente. \\"Eu... eu tenho dezessete anos, Supremo Soberano,\\" ela respondeu, sua voz quase um sussurro, enquanto se esforçava para manter a compostura na presença dele. “Você… não quer se casar com o príncipe, não é?” Lyanna hesitou, a surpresa de ser questionada por uma entidade como Malakai misturada com a súbita oportunidade de desabafar seu coração. Ela olhou para Erik, que dormia ao seu lado, e sentiu uma pontada de culpa ao admitir a verdade diante de estranhos. \\"Eu... Eu nunca desejei isso,\\" ela confessou, baixando os olhos. \\"Foi uma escolha feita para mim, para assegurar a segurança e o futuro da minha vila. Eu mal conheço o príncipe Ivan.\\" “Eu posso ver. Tudo pelo seu pai, Scar, líder da aldeia, e a querida mamãe, Sarah.” Lyanna olhou para Malakai com assombro, perguntando-se como ele poderia saber os nomes de seus pais e os detalhes de sua vida. “Como...?” Uma pedra atingiu a cabeça de Malakai com uma força suficiente para irritar, mas não para ferir. \\"Pare de entrar na mente das pessoas sem permissão,\\" Arya repreendeu, sua expressão um misto de desaprovação e alerta. \\"E pare de assustar Lyanna.\\" Malakai passou a mão por onde a pedra o atingira, um sorriso perverso emergindo em seus lábios. \\"Ah, mas é tão divertido,\\" ele zombou, mas havia um tom de advertência em sua voz. Arya se aproximou e o puxou pela orelha, utilizando o gesto como uma repreensão física à infantilidade do Supremo Soberano. \\"Kailus, controle-se,\\" ela sibilou, sua voz baixa e firme. \\"Não estamos aqui para jogos.\\" Malakai grunhiu levemente, mas o brilho em seus olhos traía sua diversão. \\"Você sempre soube como acabar com a minha diversão, Arya,\\" ele resmungou, afastando-se dela e esfregando a orelha. Erik acordou com um sobressalto, a confusão evidente em seu rosto enquanto ele tentava entender a cena diante dele. A luz do fogo dançava sobre as feições de Arya e Malakai, um contraste bizarro de calor humano e distanciamento sobrenatural. \\"O que aconteceu?\\" Erik perguntou, sua voz ainda rouca do sono e da dor. \\"Tivemos um pequeno... desacordo. Nada com que se preocupar,\\" Arya respondeu rapidamente, lançando um olhar repreensivo em direção a Malakai, que respondeu com um encolher de ombros descuidado. “Por que você o chama de Kailus, Arya?” Lyanna perguntou timidamente, o brilho das chamas refletido em seus olhos ansiosos. Havia uma curiosidade inocente em sua expressão, um desejo de entender a relação entre a feroz samurai e esse ser de poder incomensurável. Arya olhou para Lyanna, percebendo a inocência e a curiosidade pura nos olhos da jovem. Ela hesitou por um momento, ciente de que cada detalhe que compartilhava sobre Malakai aumentava o vínculo entre eles, um vínculo que ela sabia ser perigoso. Mas havia algo na forma como Lyanna perguntou, um anseio por compreender o incompreensível, que fez Arya querer responder. “Kailus foi o nome que ele deu a si mesmo quando o mundo ainda estava em sua infância, uma era de silêncio e de possibilidades infinitas. Ele andou entre as estrelas e viu civilizações nascerem e perecerem. Com o tempo, o peso de ser único em sua habilidade começou a pressioná-lo. Ele precisava de um nome que impusesse respeito e distância, um título que ressoasse com poder e domínio. Assim nasceu Malakai, o Supremo Soberano.” “Arya. Pare.” A voz de Malakai interrompeu o momento, a autoridade em sua fala era indiscutível. Arya fechou a boca, passando um olhar apreensivo para ele. O imperador demoníaco encarava-a com uma intensidade que fazia o ar em volta vibrar com um poder quase palpável. Por um breve segundo, o ambiente da caverna tensionou-se, como se o próprio tempo aguardasse a próxima palavra de Malakai. “Só para deixar claro, se eu ouvir algum de vocês dois chamando-me de Kailus, farei questão de lembrá-los de quem eu sou. Não é um nome para ser usado levianamente ou sem a devida permissão.” Malakai falava com a frieza de uma noite sem estrelas, e seu olhar era inabalável. Contudo, sua postura era de alguém que protegia algo íntimo, algo que só Arya tinha o direito de conhecer. Erik e Lyanna se entreolharam com um misto de medo e entendimento. Não ousariam desafiar a palavra do Supremo Soberano, não quando suas vidas penduravam-se por um fio tão delicado quanto a paciência de Malakai. A caverna estava agora em silêncio, exceto pelo crepitar do fogo e pelo som abafado do vento lá fora. Cada um voltou-se para seus próprios pensamentos, refletindo sobre a estranha trégua entre a luz e a escuridão que se formara entre Arya e Malakai. A barriga de Lyanna começou a roncar, rompendo a quietude da caverna com um som humano demasiado comum. O constrangimento tingiu suas faces, e ela envolveu os braços em torno do estômago, como se pudesse silenciar a fome que revelava sua vulnerabilidade. “Eu vou caçar.” Arya levantou-se abruptamente, percebendo a necessidade imediata. Ela pegou a katana e dirigiu-se à entrada da caverna. Malakai olhou para ela, um traço de desaprovação em seu rosto. “Não precisa se incomodar com isso. Posso simplesmente criar o que precisam.” Arya parou, virando-se para encará-lo. “Não. Eles precisam de algo real, algo tangível. Não de magia ou ilusões.” Malakai suspirou, levantando-se com uma elegância preguiçosa. Ele abriu um pequeno portal negro, de onde dois coelhos saltaram para a caverna, assustados, mas ilesos. Um brilho de magia negra ainda circulava-os por um segundo antes de se dissipar completamente, revelando a autenticidade de suas formas. “Não é ilusão,” Malakai afirmou, um traço de desafio em sua voz. “São reais, tão reais quanto qualquer criatura que corre por essas florestas.” Arya olhou para os coelhos, a desconfiança ainda marcada em seu rosto, mas a necessidade de alimentar seus companheiros temporários falava mais alto. Ela suspirou, seu orgulho cedendo à praticidade da situação. \\"Está bem,\\" ela disse, sua voz baixa, mas não sem um toque de gratidão relutante. Erick, agora desperto e atento, olhou com surpresa para os animais que surgiram do nada. Lyanna, ainda com as bochechas coradas de constrangimento, sorriu com a perspectiva de uma refeição quente. Malakai, satisfeito por ter ajudado, apesar da teimosia de Arya, não conseguiu evitar um sorriso arrogante. \\"Eu vou prepará-los para cozinhar,\\" Arya proclamou, levantando-se para pegar os coelhos. Ela lançou um olhar significativo para Malakai, que apenas deu de ombros, fingindo desinteresse enquanto observava a samurai trabalhar. Com movimentos habilidosos e precisos, Arya limpou e preparou os coelhos para a fogueira. O calor do fogo logo foi substituído pelo cheiro tentador de carne cozinhando, e mesmo a tensão que antes permeava a caverna pareceu se dissolver um pouco sob a promessa de uma refeição substancial. Enquanto a carne sibilava e dourava sobre as chamas, Arya sentou-se, cruzando as pernas e observando a comida com um olhar atento. Malakai, incapaz de resistir à oportunidade de provocar, aproximou-se dela, sentando-se um pouco mais perto do que o necessário. Malakai inclinou-se em direção a Arya, seus ombros quase se tocando, e Arya sentiu o calor que emanava dele contrastar com o frio da caverna. “Cheiro bom…” Malakai respirou fundo, o aroma da carne assando preenchendo o espaço estreito da caverna. Arya manteve-se focada na fogueira, mas podia sentir a presença dominadora de Malakai tão perto, uma presença que trazia tanto conforto quanto perigo. \\"E o que você sabe sobre cheiros bons? Não me parece que comer seja uma necessidade para você,\\" Arya provocou, mantendo sua voz neutra, mas não suficientemente para esconder a curiosidade. “Eu não estava me referindo a carne.” Ele se aproximou do pescoço de Arya, respirando o aroma peculiar que vinha de sua pele. \\"Eu estava falando de algo bem mais... atraente.\\" Malakai lambeu a linha de seu pescoço delicadamente, provocando um arrepio que correu pela espinha de Arya, apesar de sua determinação de não demonstrar fraqueza diante dele. O gesto íntimo era um lembrete de sua natureza predatória e da tensão sempre presente entre eles. Aproximando-se ainda mais, Malakai sussurrou em seu ouvido, com uma voz que misturava promessa e perigo. \\"Sua determinação e força tornam você irresistível, Arya. Não é de admirar que eu não consiga ficar longe.\\" Arya pegou um graveto próximo e o quebrou na cabeça de Malakai, uma reprimenda clara e física à sua provocação audaciosa. Malakai recuou, um sorriso ainda brincando nos cantos de seus lábios. A irritação de Arya não era novidade para ele, mas cada reação dela só servia para aumentar o seu fascínio pela samurai humana. “Você realmente precisa aprender a controlar esse seu temperamento,” Malakai comentou, esfregando o local onde o graveto atingira. Seu tom era brincalhão, mas havia uma provocação subjacente. “Idiota.” Arya resmungou, sem se virar para olhá-lo. \\"Apenas certifique-se de que não se aproxime novamente assim. Não estou brincando, Malakai.\\" A carne estava agora pronta, e o cheiro agradável preenchia a caverna, oferecendo um consolo bem-vindo. Arya retirou os coelhos da fogueira com cuidado, colocando-os em um prato improvisado feito de folhas grandes que ela havia coletado. Erick e Lyanna observavam, as expressões de fome em seus rostos substituídas por olhares de agradecimento. “Sirva-se” Arya disse, estendendo o prato em direção a Lyanna e Erick. \\"Comam enquanto está quente.\\" Erick pegou um pedaço, sorrindo para Arya em agradecimento. Ainda enfraquecido, ele tomou um cuidado extra para não fazer movimentos bruscos que pudessem irritar suas feridas. Lyanna, mais reservada, mas claramente aliviada, aceitou sua parte com um gesto de cabeça grato. Enquanto comiam, Arya se afastou ligeiramente, mantendo uma distância respeitosa para dar-lhes algum espaço. Malakai a segui, sentando-se ao lado dela com uma familiaridade que desafiava sua natureza enigmática. “Também estou com fome, sabia?” Ele disse, com um toque de teatralidade na voz. Arya virou-se para ele, os olhos estreitando-se enquanto ela avaliava se ele estava falando sério. \\"Você não come esse tipo de comida,\\" Arya respondeu, com uma ponta de sarcasmo. \\"Você só se alimenta de… Não. De modo algum.” Droga. Ele estava com fome de sangue. “Kailus, não a—” Ele tapou a boca de Arya rapidamente com a mão, seus olhos vermelhos agora ardendo com uma intensidade feroz que não deixava margem para argumentos. “Só um pouquinho, Arya. Eles não vão nem notar,\\" ele sussurrou, sua voz um misto de sedução e ameaça. A mão de Malakai ainda cobria a boca de Arya, impedindo qualquer som de escapar. Seus olhos encontraram os dela, o fogo refletindo neles, criando um jogo de luz e sombras que parecia dançar com a tensão do momento. O olhar de Malakai era um redemoinho de desejo e impulso primitivo, mas mesmo nas profundezas daquele abismo vermelho, uma faísca de hesitação brilhava. Arya, cujo coração batia com a força de um tambor de guerra, conhecia aquele olhar muito bem. Era o mesmo olhar que a acompanhava desde o dia em que encontrou o imperador caído na estrada, o mesmo olhar que carregava a dualidade de seu ser: o poder supremo e a solidão infinita. “Espere eles dormirem, e eu te darei o necessário.” A voz de Arya era um sussurro, uma promessa sibilada que carregava o peso de sua própria resolução. Ela conhecia o risco que estava assumindo, mas também entendia o delicado equilíbrio de poder entre eles. Malakai retirou a mão de sua boca lentamente, o contato de seus dedos deixando um rastro de calor na pele de Arya. Ele assentiu uma vez, reconhecendo a concessão dela e a confiança implícita que isso representava. “Certo. Eu vou esperar,” Malakai concordou, recuando para permitir que Arya respirasse mais livremente. Seu olhar ainda permanecia nela, uma chama de gratidão e algo mais indefinível ardia em seus olhos. Com um gesto de cabeça, ele se afastou e começou a caminhar em direção à outra extremidade da caverna, mas não sem antes lançar um olhar sobre o ombro, um sorriso quase imperceptível tocando seus lábios. Arya observou Malakai se afastar, sentindo uma mistura de alívio e apreensão agitar-se em seu peito. Ela se virou para Erick e Lyanna, que agora estavam satisfeitos e sonolentos pelo calor do fogo e pela refeição que tinham acabado de compartilhar. “Vocês devem descansar,” aconselhou Arya suavemente. “Nós temos um longo caminho pela frente amanhã.” Erick assentiu com a cabeça, agradecendo outra vez com um olhar sincero. “Não sei como poderemos agradecer por tudo que vocês estão fazendo por nós,” ele disse, sua voz cheia de gratidão. Erick concordou, suas pálpebras agora pesadas pelo cansaço. Lyanna já havia se aconchegado mais perto do fogo, deixando-se levar pelo abraço acolhedor do sono. Com sua respiração se tornando mais lenta e profunda, o casal logo sucumbiu ao descanso merecido, deixando Arya e Malakai em vigília. Arya se levantou silenciosamente, caminhando até a entrada da caverna para mais uma vez verificar o perímetro. Ela podia sentir a presença de Malakai atrás dela, a quietude dele um contraste com a voracidade que sabia estar espreitando logo abaixo da superfície calma. \\"Por que me olha tanto?” A voz de Arya quebrou o silêncio, carregada de leves notas de desafio e curiosidade. Ela não se virou para encarar Malakai, mas pôde sentir a intensidade do olhar dele em suas costas, uma presença quase física. “Eles dormiram.” A voz de Malakai parecia vir de todos os lados, uma reverberação que preenchia a caverna com uma promessa silenciosa. Arya sabia o que aquilo significava. Ela suspirou, a determinação endurecendo suas feições sob a luz fria da lua que se infiltrava pela entrada da caverna. Girando nos calcanhares, ela encarou Malakai, os olhos amarelos brilhando com uma luz própria, um farol no escuro que desafiava a escuridão à sua frente. “Está na hora,” ela disse, a voz baixa, mas firme, carregada com a aceitação de seu acordo. Malakai aproximou-se, o ar ao seu redor vibrando com uma energia que parecia alterar a própria gravidade do lugar. Assumindo uma postura desafiadora, Arya esperou, pronta para cumprir sua palavra, mas também alerta para qualquer sinal de excesso por parte de Malakai. O Supremo Soberano observou-a por um momento, medindo-a não apenas com os olhos, mas com todos os sentidos, percebendo cada batida acelerada de seu coração, cada respiração contida. Então, com uma suavidade que contrastava com a violência que muitas vezes acompanhava sua natureza, ele aproximou-se ainda mais, um dos seus braços rodeando a cintura de Arya para trazê-la para perto. Com a outra mão, ele afastou delicadamente os cabelos negros de seu pescoço, expondo a pele pálida à Lua e ao desejo que ele mal conseguia conter. “Deliciosa…” Ele a empurrou para trás de uma parede que estava a poucos passos de distância, seus olhos vermelhos fixos nos dela com uma intensidade que parecia atravessar a própria alma. Arya, embora firme, não pôde evitar a onda de incerteza que a invadiu. Malakai era um ser de poder incomensurável, e ela, apesar de destemida, ainda era mortal. Malakai inclinou-se, sua respiração quente contra a pele fria de Arya, fazendo com que ela se arrepiasse involuntariamente. Ela fechou os olhos, preparando-se para a sensação de seus caninos perfurando a pele. “Ah!” A dor aguda foi rápida, mas mais intensa do que Arya esperava. Malakai sentiu o sangue quente de Arya fluir para sua boca, um gosto que era ao mesmo tempo uma indulgência e um lembrete de sua eterna maldição. Arya, com seus olhos ainda fechados, sentiu as forças fugindo rapidamente, mas confiava em Malakai, ou talvez confiasse em sua própria capacidade de pará-lo se ele fosse longe demais. Ela podia sentir a mão dele firme em sua cintura, não apenas como um ato possessivo, mas também como um suporte, como se ele reconhecesse a necessidade de mantê-la de pé enquanto tomava o que precisava para saciar sua fome ancestral. Através do contato, um entendimento silencioso era compartilhado entre eles; um pacto que não precisava de palavras para ser selado. A medida que Malakai bebia, o mundo de Arya começou a girar, as paredes da caverna se fundindo em uma espiral de cores e sombras. Ela soube, com a clareza que antecede a inconsciência, que ele se detinha na beira do que seria demais, calculando cada gole com uma precisão que desmentia seu comportamento usualmente desdenhoso. “Kailus… chega.” Malakai parou imediatamente ao ouvir a voz enfraquecida de Arya, a urgência em sua palavra de comando ecoando na escuridão da caverna como um sino de advertência. Ele se afastou, um filete de sangue ainda escorrendo pelo canto de sua boca, seus olhos vermelhos refletindo uma mistura de satisfação e preocupação. Ele a pegou nos braços antes que ela pudesse desabar, a força em seu corpo dissipada pelo gesto íntimo que haviam compartilhado. A respiração de Arya era superficial e irregular, mas ela estava consciente, seus olhos amarelos brilhando com uma luz fraca que ainda detinha o poder de seu espírito indomável. “Você está bem?” Malakai perguntou, a preocupação em sua voz um contraste com o tom autoritário que normalmente usava. Arya assentiu levemente, tentando reunir sua força. “Sim, apenas... fraca. Dê-me um momento.” Sua voz era um sussurro, mas ainda assim carregado com a firmeza que a caracterizava. Malakai a levou de volta ao calor reconfortante da fogueira, depositando-a suavemente no chão. A luz das chamas iluminava seu rosto, destacando a palidez que tomara conta de sua pele. Ele observou enquanto a respiração de Arya se tornava mais regular, os sinais de recuperação começando a aparecer. Com o rosto de Arya banhado pelo brilho da fogueira, Malakai observou-a com uma intensidade incomum, a preocupação evidente em seu semblante. Não era comum para o Supremo Soberano sentir algo tão próximo da ansiedade, mas Arya não era uma presença comum em sua existência infinita. Arya, por sua vez, lutava para manter os olhos abertos, a fraqueza em seu corpo uma sensação estranha e perturbadora. \\"Eu preciso... de água,\\" ela murmurou, a garganta seca e a língua áspera após o contato com a fome voraz de Malakai. Sem hesitar, Malakai moveu-se com uma velocidade que desafiava a percepção humana, retornando momentos depois com um cantil de água fresca. Ele ergueu a cabeça de Arya delicadamente, apoiando-a contra seu joelho enquanto levava o cantil aos seus lábios. \\"Beba lentamente,\\" ele instruiu, sua voz baixa e calmante, um tom raramente utilizado. A água fria desceu pela garganta de Arya como uma bênção, cada gole trazendo um pouco mais de vida à sua expressão cansada. A luz do fogo dançava em seu rosto, lançando um brilho sobre as linhas determinadas de sua mandíbula. Ela devolveu o cantil a Malakai com um aceno de cabeça agradecido, seus olhos encontrando os dele por um momento e reconhecendo um lampejo de... seria preocupação? Malakai parecia prestes a dizer algo, sua postura rígida e a forma como ele desviava o olhar do dela eram incomuns. Ele estava acostumado a olhar para o mundo e suas criaturas com indiferença ou desdém, mas com Arya, as coisas eram diferentes. “Você nunca demonstrou preocupação assim antes,” Arya observou, a voz ainda fraca, mas sua mente clara como cristal. “Isso me faz pensar se você está começando a se sentir... humano.” O Supremo Soberano soltou uma risada seca. “Humano? Eu? Não seja ridícula, Arya. Eu apenas... reconheço a vantagem de ter você ao meu lado.” Ele se afastou um pouco, desconfortável com a direção da conversa. Pelo que parece, Arya havia desmaiado pois acordou com a luz do amanhecer lhe beijando o rosto, e uma capa pesada a cobrindo – com certeza, trabalho de Malakai. Sua cabeça ainda girava um pouco, mas ela sentia-se bem melhor agora que o descanso havia permitido a seu corpo começar a se recuperar da perda de sangue. Lyanna e Erik já estavam acordados, arrumando suas coisas. “Por que não me acordaram?” Arya perguntou, sua voz ainda carregando um traço da fadiga do dia anterior. “Você parecia estar precisando do descanso,” respondeu Erik com um sorriso gentil, mas preocupado. “Além disso… o Supremo Soberano disse que arrancaria nossas mãos se tentássemos acordá-la,\\" terminou ele, lançando um olhar nervoso na direção onde Malakai havia se recolhido na sombra de uma formação rochosa. “Ah… esse idiota.” Arya se sentou, afastando a capa pesada que Malakai havia colocado sobre ela durante a noite. Ela esticou os membros dormentes, sentindo o formigamento desconfortável que percorria seus braços e pernas à medida que circulação retornava ao normal. Olhando ao redor, ela viu Malakai afastado, sua figura imponente recortada contra o nascer do sol que banhava a entrada da caverna com tons de laranja e vermelho. “Malakai,” Arya chamou, sua voz mais firme agora que ela havia recuperado parte de sua energia. Ela se aproximou dele, cada passo marcado por uma determinação que compensava o desconforto que ainda sentia. “Vamos. Nós chegaremos em Askov em três dias se mantivermos um bom ritmo,” Ela disse, esperando que ele se levantasse e se juntasse a eles. Malakai apenas olhou para ela, a luz do amanhecer refletindo nos seus olhos escarlate, dando-lhes um brilho quase sobrenatural. “Três dias, huh?” Malakai finalmente se levantou, a capa negra que usava ondulando com o movimento. “Muito bem, mas espero que não esteja planejando fazer mais paradas heroicas pelo caminho.” Quando sairam da caverna, a neve havia parado e a grama sob seus pés estava coberta por uma fina camada de gelo. O ar frio da manhã parecia mais suportável agora que o sol começava a escalar o céu, prometendo um dia mais claro do que o anterior. Erik e Lyanna seguiam à frente, o rapaz ainda caminhando com dificuldade devido aos ferimentos, mas determinado a não atrasar o grupo. Lyanna, por sua vez, mantinha-se perto de Erik, oferecendo apoio sempre que ele vacilava. “Eu ainda não entrei na sua mente, jovem Erik.” A voz de Malakai surgiu repentinamente, rompendo o silêncio que havia se instalado entre o grupo durante a caminhada matinal. As palavras, ditas de forma casual, congelaram Erik em seu lugar, fazendo-o virar-se para encarar o Supremo Soberano com uma mistura de confusão e alarme. Erik permaneceu imóvel, sua respiração acelerada e seus olhos fixos em Malakai, tentando entender o significado por trás de suas palavras. Focado em Erik, Malakai captou tudo: A aldeia, sua esposa Celeste, o filhinho de apenas um ano que tinha deixado para trás, a ordem do líder de escoltar Lyanna, a sensação de falha ao não conseguir protegê-la dos mercenários, a dor das feridas que ainda latejavam em seu corpo. Foi uma leitura rápida, mas profunda, um mergulho nos medos e esperanças de Erik. Erik levou a mão ao nariz de repente, sentindo o sangue quente e espesso correr por entre seus dedos. Ele cambaleou, surpreendido pela invasão súbita de Malakai em sua mente, uma violação que o deixou desnorteado e vulnerável. Arya, com uma destreza que desmentia seu estado ainda fragilizado, rapidamente agarrou Malakai pelos cabelos prateados, puxando-o com força para trás. A surpresa de Malakai foi evidente; ele não esperava uma reação tão física de Arya, especialmente depois do que havia acontecido entre eles na noite anterior. “O que pensa que está fazendo?” Arya vociferou, a raiva feroz em sua voz fazendo com que até mesmo o Supremo Soberano hesitasse. “Prometi protegê-los, e não permitirei que brinque com a mente de alguém da minha proteção.” Malakai olhou para Arya, sua surpresa inicial dando lugar a um sorriso arrogante que desafiava a fúria em seus olhos amarelos. \\"Eu estava apenas curioso,\\" ele respondeu, sua voz contendo um traço de diversão que só serviu para inflamar ainda mais a ira de Arya. “Curiosidade não lhe dá o direito de invadir a mente alheia. Erik é um humano, não um brinquedo para sua diversão!” Arya manteve a mão firme nos cabelos de Malakai, pronta para puxá-lo novamente se ele mostrasse qualquer sinal de resistência. Erik, ainda segurando o nariz ensanguentado, olhou para Arya com uma mistura de gratidão e temor. A samurai não apenas havia salvado sua vida e de Lyanna, mas agora também os defendia do ser mais temido e poderoso que conheciam. “Eu entendo a sua proteção para com eles, Arya, mas não precisa ser tão... física,” Malakai disse, tentando recuperar sua postura habitual de indiferença. “Argh! Estou indo embora por enquanto.” Malakai se afastou com um movimento fluido e arrogante, a irritação em seu rosto tão evidente quanto a neve que ainda cobria o chão. Com um olhar irritado para Arya, ele desapareceu em um vórtice escuro que se fechou com um suspiro silencioso, deixando para trás apenas o frio que acompanhava sua magia. Arya soltou o ar que não sabia que estava segurando, seus olhos ainda fixos no espaço onde Malakai havia estado. Ela relaxou ligeiramente, mas a tensão em seus ombros não desapareceu completamente. \\"Ele vai voltar,\\" ela murmurou mais para si mesma do que para Erik ou Lyanna. \\"Ele sempre volta.\\" Há noite, eles tinham apenas 3 grãos de nozes para comerem. Arya olhou para os três grãos de nozes nas palmas de suas mãos, sentindo a ironia amarga de suas escassas provisões contra a vastidão da natureza ao seu redor. Erik e Lyanna, sentados do outro lado da fogueira, compartilhavam um olhar silencioso, suas expressões tensas revelando a preocupação sobre o que os aguardava na jornada seguinte. “Vamos dividir esses,” Arya disse, quebrando a quietude que havia se instalado. Ela estendeu um grão para cada um, mantendo o último para si. \\"Não é muito, mas manterá nossa força até encontrarmos mais comida.\\" “Se o Supremo Soberano estivesse aqui, ele poderia fazer comida para nós,\\" Lyanna murmurou, sua voz trêmula de fome e exaustão. Erik olhou para Arya antes de aceitar o grão de noz oferecido. \\"Não podemos depender dele para tudo. Arya já fez mais do que qualquer um poderia esperar.\\" Arya acenou com a cabeça em concordância e mastigou seu grão de noz devagar, tentando extrair cada última gota de energia que ele poderia oferecer. A luz da fogueira dançava em seus olhos, refletindo a determinação que ardiam dentro dela, uma chama que não seria extinta pela fome ou pelo frio. \\"Vou caçar,\\" Arya declarou de repente, levantando-se com uma agilidade que desmentia a fadiga que sentia. \\"Fiquem aqui e mantenham o fogo aceso. Eu voltarei em breve.\\" Erik e Lyanna acenaram, compreendendo a necessidade da ação de Arya. Ela se afastou da luz do fogo, desaparecendo na escuridão da floresta como uma sombra em busca de esperança. Arya avançava pela floresta escura, a neve abaixo de seus pés mascarando qualquer som que suas passadas pudessem produzir. A lua, um fino crescente no céu, oferecia pouca luz, deixando a samurai confiar mais em seu instinto do que em sua visão. Enquanto se movia com cuidado entre as árvores, seus olhos vasculhavam a escuridão em busca de qualquer sinal de vida. Ela sabia que a caça seria escassa, mas a fome que apertava seu estômago não deixava espaço para dúvidas ou hesitações. Cada movimento era calculado, cada respiração controlada, cada sentido em alerta máximo. Foi então que aconteceu. Um passo em falso, uma superfície instável sob a neve e, de repente, Arya sentiu seu pé afundar inesperadamente no que parecia ser um buraco oculto pela camada branca. A sensação de torção foi imediata, uma dor aguda irradiando por seu tornozelo. Um grunhido de dor escapou por entre seus dentes cerrados enquanto ela caía de joelhos na neve. Ela apertou o local ferido, a respiração se tornando mais rápida conforme lutava contra o pico de sofrimento. A adrenalina ainda pulsava em suas veias, mantendo a dor em um nível gerenciável, mas Arya sabia que isso não duraria muito. Então, um lobo branco GIGANTE surgiu do meio das sombras da floresta, seus olhos brilhantes como dois rubis refletindo a luz da lua. O lobo observava Arya com uma curiosidade predatória, a cabeça inclinada de lado enquanto avaliava a presa ferida diante de si. Arya congelou, seus olhos arregalados, fixos no lobo branco gigante que emergira das sombras. A voz que saiu do lobo era inesperadamente suave e profunda, vibrando com uma familiaridade que a confundia e aliviava ao mesmo tempo. \\"Isso parece estar doendo, Arya,\\" disse o lobo, sua fala clara e articulada de uma forma que nenhum animal normal poderia conseguir. A samurai ficou boquiaberta, a dor em seu tornozelo temporariamente esquecida diante da visão e da voz do lobo. \\"Malakai?\\" ela arriscou, a suspeita nascendo em sua mente enquanto observava os olhos rubi do lobo, tão semelhantes aos de Malakai. O lobo gigante sentou-se na neve, um sorriso quase humano brincando em seus lábios lupinos. \\"Você me conhece tão bem, Arya. Sim, sou eu. Achei que essa forma seria apropriada para uma caçada noturna,\\" Malakai disse, sua cauda branca varrendo a neve de maneira pensativa. Arya observou o lobo gigante, um misto de frustração e admiração marcando sua expressão enquanto tentava processar a transformação de Malakai. \\"Você pode mudar de forma agora?\\" ela perguntou, tentando manter a voz firme apesar da onda de dor que emanava de seu tornozelo. Malakai, ainda na forma de lobo, inclinou a cabeça em um gesto que evidenciava seu orgulho. \\"Eu sou o Supremo Soberano. Não há limites para o que posso fazer,\\" ele respondeu, a voz ecoando com uma autoridade sobrenatural. \\"Então, o Supremo Soberano vai me ajudar a voltar para o acampamento?\\" Arya retrucou, a dor começando a fazer sua paciência se esvair. \\"Hmm... depende. Vai me obrigar a pedir desculpas para aquele humano novamente?\\" Malakai perguntou, erguendo uma sobrancelha peluda. Arya bufou, a dor em seu tornozelo tornando-a menos tolerante com as brincadeiras de Malakai. \\"Esqueça as desculpas, apenas me ajude a levantar,\\" ela resmungou. O enorme lobo branco então se aproximou e, com um cuidado que contradizia seu tamanho e natureza selvagem, abaixou-se ao lado de Arya. \\"Suba nas minhas costas,\\" ele instruiu, mantendo-se agachado para que ela pudesse alcançar. Com um suspiro de resignação misturado com alívio, Arya usou o que restava de sua força para se posicionar nas costas do lobo. Malakai então se levantou lentamente, garantindo que Arya estivesse segura antes de começar a caminhar de volta ao acampamento. A caminhada de volta ao acampamento foi silenciosa, apenas o som dos passos do lobo gigante na neve quebrando o silêncio da noite. Arya, segurando-se firmemente na densa pelagem branca, sentia cada movimento do corpo poderoso e ágil de Malakai sob ela, uma mistura reconfortante de força e controle. A lua iluminava o caminho de volta, lançando um brilho prateado sobre a floresta, transformando o mundo à sua volta em uma paisagem de sombras e luz. “Vou correr um pouquinho…” Malakai acelerou, seus músculos ondulando poderosamente sob Arya enquanto ele se lançava pela floresta com uma velocidade surpreendente. Os ramos passavam por eles em um borrão, e Arya se agarrava à pelagem do lobo, o ar frio cortando seu rosto enquanto eles avançavam pela noite. “Kailus!” A velocidade com que se moviam era vertiginosa, e Arya mal conseguia manter os olhos abertos contra o vento gelado que batia contra seu rosto. Entre o cansaço e a adrenalina que corria por suas veias, ela sentia a dor em seu tornozelo diminuir, tornando-se uma mera memória distante enquanto confiava completamente em Malakai para levá-la em segurança. Finalmente, o lobo gigante desacelerou, aproximando-se do acampamento com uma elegância que desafiava seu tamanho. A fogueira, reduzida agora a brasas cintilantes, projetava uma luz suave e reconfortante. Malakai se abaixou mais uma vez, permitindo que Arya deslizasse para o chão com cuidado, apoiando-se em uma árvore próxima para não colocar peso sobre o tornozelo lesionado.","completion":"Assim que Arya tocou o chão, a luz da fogueira revelou a preocupação estampada nos rostos de Erik e Lyanna, que se levantaram rapidamente ao vê-la retornar. Vendo Malakai ainda em forma de lobo, mas com uma expressão surpreendentemente mansa, os dois relaxaram ligeiramente, ainda intrigados com a incomum cena. \\"Você está bem?\\" Erik perguntou, observando o tornozelo de Arya com uma expressão de consternação. \\"Vou sobreviver,\\" Arya respondeu com um sorriso fraco, consciente de que precisaria de um tempo para se recuperar. Ela olhou para Malakai, esperando que ele retomasse sua forma humana e explicasse sua súbita saída e retorno dramático. Com uma calma que parecia desafiar a urgência do momento, Malakai transformou-se, emergindo da forma lupina imponente em sua estatura habitual e imponente. A transformação foi acompanhada por uma onda de energia que fez a luz da fogueira brilhar mais intensamente por um breve segundo. \\"Eu estava caçando,\\" Malakai disse, observando Arya com um olhar que misturava uma leve zombaria com preocupação genuína. \\"E parece que eu encontrei algo mais interessante.\\" Erik e Lyanna compartilharam um olhar confuso, ainda tentando assimilar a fluidez com que Malakai passava de uma presença ameaçadora para quase... protetora. \\"Agora,\\" disse Malakai, voltando sua atenção para Arya, \\"acho que você precisa de cuidados adequados para esse tornozelo.\\" Ele estendeu a mão, e, em um gesto suave, uma faixa de tecido apareceu, flutuando até as mãos de Arya. \\"Isso deve ajudar.\\" Arya aceitou a faixa, surpreendida pela gentileza inesperada, mas também agradecida pela eficiência de Malakai em fornecer o que era necessário. Com a ajuda de Lyanna, ela cuidadosamente envolveu o tornozelo, sentindo um alívio imediato com a pressão do tecido. \\"Obrigada,\\" Arya murmurou, dirigindo-se a ambos Malakai e Lyanna. \\"Mas ainda precisamos de comida.\\" Malakai, que parecia estar em um estado de reflexão, acenou com a cabeça. “Deixe isso comigo.” Um momento depois, com um breve fechar e abrir de olhos, uma variedade de frutas, pães e carne apareceu diante deles, arranjada em uma bandeja rústica mas elegante. A mudança foi tão súbita que Arya apenas conseguiu olhar, maravilhada, para a comida que havia surgido do nada. Ela olhou para Malakai, uma gratidão não dita mas profundamente sentida brilhando em seus olhos. \\"Por isso, eu realmente agradeço,\\" ela disse, sabendo que a bondade de Malakai, ainda que irregular, tinha sido a salvação deles naquele momento. Eles comeram em silêncio, cada um perdido em seus pensamentos, mas unidos pelo calor da fogueira e pela generosidade inesperada de Malakai. Arduino, o peso do dia começou a pesar sobre eles, trazendo o cansaço e o sono rápido. Enquanto se preparavam para descansar, Arya encontrou o olhar de Malakai, reconhecendo uma profundidade ali que às vezes se escondia por trás de seu sarcasmo e aparente despreocupação. Eles compartilhavam um entendimento não dito, uma conexão que, apesar de seus muitos desafios, havia se tornado um alicerce em sua relação turbulenta. Com o tornozelo ferido e a incerteza de sua missão pesando sobre seus ombros, Arya sabia que os próximos dias seriam uma prova de sua resistência, coragem e da complexa aliança que havia forjado com Malakai. Mas, naquele momento, sob o manto da noite, alimentados e aquecidos pela generosidade surpreendente de um ser que eles mal compreendiam, havia uma faísca de esperança e de uma estranha sensação de pertencimento. Arya se acomodou para dormir, o calor da fogueira e a presença protetora de Malakai proporcionando um conforto inesperado em um mundo cheio de incertezas e perigos. E, por uma noite, a floresta parecia menos selvagem, o futuro menos ameaçador, e a companhia um ao lado do outro, apesar das diferenças, um lembrete de que juntos, talvez, eles poderiam enfrentar o que quer que viesse a seguir."},{"prompt":"Write a scene where Ursa Wren and Gar Saxon sends a bounty hunter named Boba Fett to find Usra's daughter, Ursa says \\"Find my daughter Sabine\\" Gar says \\"And please bring her alive\\" (Write it like a script)","completion":"INT.

END SCENE."},{"prompt":"Using first principles, teach me how to plant a papaya plant","completion":"Planting a papaya plant from first principles involves understanding the fundamental concepts of plant growth and applying these to the specific needs of the papaya. Here, we'll start with the basic requirements of most plants—soil, water, light, and air—and tailor these to suit a papaya plant specifically. Remember, our goal is to mimic the natural conditions that papayas thrive in as closely as possible. # 1. Understand the Papaya Plant Papaya (Carica papaya) is a tropical fruit tree known for its nutritious, sweet fruits. It requires a warm climate to thrive and is sensitive to frost. Understanding these basic needs is crucial for successful growth. # 2. Choose the Right Variety Depending on your region, select a papaya variety that is suited for your climate. There are hermaphroditic, male, and female papaya plants, but hermaphroditic or self-pollinating types are often preferred for fruit production because you don't need to plant multiple trees to ensure pollination. # 3. Seed Preparation - **Source Fresh Seeds:** Use seeds from a ripe papaya. Fresh seeds have a higher germination rate. - **Clean and Dry Seeds:** Wash the seeds to remove the gelatinous coating and dry them slightly. They do not need to be completely dried to plant, but shouldn't be sopping wet. # 4. Soil and Site - **Soil:** Prepare a well-draining soil mix. Papayas don’t tolerate soggy conditions. If you are in a heavy clay area, consider raising beds or containers. - **pH:** Aim for a soil pH of around 6.0 to 6.5. Adjust soil pH if necessary, as extreme acidity or alkalinity can lock out essential nutrients. - **Location:** Choose a sunny, sheltered spot. Papayas need full sun and protection from strong winds. # 5. Planting - **When:** In tropical or subtropical regions, you can plant papaya year-round. In areas with a distinct cooler season, plant after the last frost. - **How:** Plant seeds directly in the ground or start them indoors if you have a short growing season. Plant seeds about ½ inch deep. If planting directly in the ground, space seeds or seedlings about 8-10 feet apart to allow for growth and air circulation. # 6. Water and Moisture - **Watering:** Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged during the germination and early growth phase. Once established, papayas still like regular watering but ensure good drainage. - **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch around the base to conserve moisture and suppress weeds. # 7. Nutrients and Care - **Fertilization:** Feed your papaya plant with a balanced fertilizer every 14-30 days during the growing season. Papayas are heavy feeders and benefit from regular fertilization. - **Pruning:** Minimal pruning is needed. Remove dead or diseased parts as necessary. Some growers prune the top to encourage more fruiting branches. # 8. Monitoring and Protection - **Pests/Diseases:** Keep an eye out for common pests and diseases. Use organic pesticides if necessary. - **Freeze Protection:** In cooler climates, be prepared to protect your papayas from cold. Use frost cloths or move potted papayas indoors if temperatures drop. # 9. Harvesting Papayas are ready to harvest once they appear slightly yellow or when the fruit gives slightly under pressure. Harvesting usually occurs within 9-12 months from planting. # Conclusion By starting with the basic necessities of the papaya plant and adjusting as you go along, you can successfully grow papaya even as a beginner. Being observant and responsive to your plant’s needs throughout its growth phases is key. With patience and care, you'll be able to enjoy fresh papayas from your own garden."},{"prompt":"Thanks!","completion":"You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy gardening with your papaya plant!"},{"prompt":"Que significa dx/dy en análisis, y cual es la diferencia con dy/dx, por ejemplo","completion":"En cálculos y análisis matemáticos, dx/dy y dy/dx son ejemplos de derivadas. Estas expresiones representan el concepto de la tasa de cambio de una variable con respecto a otra. Sin embargo, representan relaciones inversas entre las mismas dos variables. Veamos más detalladamente qué significa cada una y su diferencia: 1. **dy/dx**: Esta es la forma más común de representación de una derivada y significa la derivada de y respecto a x. En términos simples, representa cómo cambia la variable dependiente (y) con respecto a pequeños cambios en la variable independiente (x). Esta relación se utiliza para entender cómo la función (y = f(x)) cambia a medida que (x) cambia. Por ejemplo, en el contexto de un gráfico en el plano cartesiano, dy/dx describe la pendiente de la curva en un punto dado, lo que nos dice cómo de \\"inclinada\\" está la curva en ese punto, reflejando la tasa de cambio de (y) respecto a (x). 2. **dx/dy**: Este término es menos común y significa la derivada de (x) respecto a (y). Esencialmente, es una inversión de dy/dx, y representa cómo cambia la variable independiente (x) con pequeños cambios en la variable dependiente (y). En el contexto de una función (x = g(y)), dx/dy expresaría cómo cambia (x) a medida que (y) varía. **Diferencia principal entre dy/dx y dx/dy**: La diferencia principal entre estas dos notaciones radica en cuál variable se considera la variable independiente y cuál la dependiente en la relación. Para dy/dx, asumimos que (y) depende de (x), lo cual es lo más común en muchas aplicaciones prácticas, como en física, ingeniería o economía, donde (x) puede ser el tiempo, la distancia, u otra cantidad que controlamos o observamos. Para dx/dy, la perspectiva se invierte, considerando que (x) depende de (y). Interpretando las derivadas de forma más matemática, (dy/dx) nos proporciona la pendiente de la tangente a la curva (y=f(x)) en un punto dado, facilitando entender cómo varía (y) en función de (x). Mientras tanto, (dx/dy) nos daría la pendiente de la tangente a la curva (x=g(y)), indicando cómo varía (x) en función de (y). En conclusión, aunque dy/dx y dx/dy tratan sobre las tasas de cambio entre dos variables, el enfoque y la interpretación de estas derivadas difieren según la dirección de la dependencia considerada entre las variables."},{"prompt":"Era Medieval. A história é sobre Malakai, um imperador demoníaco, uma entidade suprema. O primeiro ser da existência. Criou todo o mundo e universo. Malakai é o único ser em todo o universo que possui magia. Nenhum outro humano pode. As pessoas chamam Malakai de Supremo Soberano, Imperador, e Imperador Supremo. Ele é o imperador de todos os reinos, de todos os continentes, de tudo. Ele é um ser que se alimenta de sangue humano, cruel e perverso. Dizem que ele come crianças e sacrifica mulheres virgens. Alto, cabelos prateados até a cintura, olhos vermelhos com pupilas animalescas, caninos afiados e pontiagudos, unhas pretas compridas, postura elegante e imponente. Arya, a única samurai mulher de um clã que foi exterminada quando ela tinha 6 anos. Ela, 20 anos, tem os cabelos curtos escuros, olhos amarelos incomuns, usa roupa samurai preta e porta uma katana. Odeia vestidos e joias. Nao existia mulheres samurais naquela época. Arya encontrou Malakai desacordado na estrada. Malakai passou a segui-la simplesmente. Eles se tornaram parceiros por 2 anos. Malakai passou a nutrir sentimentos possessivos e abusivos com Arya, mas ele não sabia. Malakai era obcecado por Arya, ele tinha uma vontade enorme de a ter para ele, a morder. Um dia, Malakai cansou de bancar o humano e tomou a coroa e voltou a governar o mundo todo, todos os reinos, o universo, etc. Obviamente, Arya não o seguiu pois ela tinha a própria missão a seguir: encontrar quem mandou assassinar seu clã. Porém, arya realmente considerava Malakai um amigo. Malakai é um ser tranquilo, basta não o provocar… Outra coisa, Malakai já confessou milhares de vezes que é apaixonado por Arya. Malakai é sarcástico, irônico, meio bobo, relaxado, zombeteiro, insolente, inconveniente, irritante, implicante, brincalhão, despreocupado, adora provocar, é infantil e rebelde. Arya sempre batia em Malakai, e ele nunca revidava ou desviava. Malakai deu permissão para Arya o chamar pelo seu nome de origem e criação ‘Kailus’. Arya ainda estava em busca de vingança. Era uma noite de muita neve e o frio cortava como lâminas afiadas. Arya, com sua determinação inabalável, avançava pela tempestade, cada passo uma promessa de justiça. Na escuridão, a luz da lua refletia na lâmina de sua katana, um farol de resolução em meio ao caos branco. Seu fôlego formava pequenas nuvens que se dissipavam rapidamente, assim como as dúvidas que tentavam se instalar em sua mente. Ela não vacilaria, não enquanto o sangue de seu clã clamasse por vingança. “Por que foi mesmo que eu criei a neve?” A voz grave e sombria de Malakai irrompeu através do silêncio gélido, interrompendo os pensamentos de Arya. Ela parou, virando-se para olhar o imponente imperador demoníaco por trás de si. Malakai já estava seguindo a há meses, permanecendo como uma sombra e observando cada movimento da samurai. Apesar de seu poder imenso, havia algo na determinação férrea de Arya que fascinava o Supremo Soberano. “Ainda está me seguindo, Kailus?\\" Arya perguntou, a voz carregada de um cansaço que ela não permitia que seu corpo demonstrasse. Malakai surgiu das sombras, a neve ao seu redor parecendo recuar diante de sua presença. \\"Arya,\\" ele começou, com um tom que misturava diversão e um leve traço de desdém, \\"eu criei as estrelas, as marés e as chamas da vida. Você acha realmente que deixaria de seguir a única criatura que conseguiu me desafiar, a única que me faz questionar o propósito da minha própria existência?\\" Arya franziu o cenho, sua expressão revelando uma ponta de respeito relutante. “Calado. Me ajude a apanhar galhos para a fogueira, ou vá embora.” Ela voltou-se, ignorando a figura imponente de Malakai, e começou a catar galhos quebradiços sob a neve. Malakai observou-a por um momento, um sorriso indecifrável pairando em seus lábios antes de se mover para ajudá-la. Havia uma harmonia estranha entre eles, uma dança de sombras e luz onde o poderoso Supremo Soberano se rendia à simplicidade de ajudar a samurai na tarefa mundana. “Kai. Espere. Está sentindo esse cheiro?” A expressão de Malakai endureceu enquanto ele aspirava o ar frio da noite, sua postura antes relaxada agora tensa e alerta. O cheiro metálico de sangue fresco misturava-se com o aroma congelante da neve, um claro indicativo de perigo próximo. \\"É sangue,\\" ele murmurou, sua voz um rosnado baixo. Sem hesitar, Arya puxou sua katana, os olhos varrendo o horizonte por sinais de movimento. Arya avançou cautelosa entre as árvores desnudas, a neve estalando sob seus pés. Ao chegar ao local, seus olhos captaram a cena de desolação: uma carruagem tombada com suas rodas apontando para o céu noturno e corpos de soldados espalhados no solo gelado, suas roupas manchadas com o escarlate da vida que já não possuíam. A frieza da noite parecia agora ainda mais profunda, refletindo o silêncio da morte que ali se abatera. “Kailus…” Ela rosnou. “Não olhe para mim. Eu não tenho nada a ver com isso,” Malakai respondeu, a voz repleta de um desdém frio. “Esses são os humanos, com suas guerras e disputas mesquinhas.” Ele se agachou ao lado de um corpo, examinando-o com um olhar crítico. “As roupas são muito ruins para serem de algum nobre. Provavelmente, soldados de alguma aldeia pequena.” Levantou-se, limpo de qualquer culpa, um espectro de alguém que já tinha visto tais cenas inúmeras vezes. “Erick… estou com medo.” A voz trêmula veio de trás da carruagem, uma jovem mulher surgiu, agarrando o braço de um homem ferido. Seus olhos, grandes e temerosos, fixavam-se em Arya e Malakai. O homem, um soldado com a armadura destroçada, tentava se manter firme, mas as pernas mal o sustentavam. \\"Ajude-nos, por favor,\\" implorou a mulher, os cabelos desgrenhados emoldurando seu rosto pálido. Arya olhou para Malakai antes de se aproximar, a katana ainda em punho, pronta para enfrentar o que quer que tivesse causado aquela carnificina. “Quem são vocês?” Malakai observava a cena com uma curiosidade desapegada, como se as vidas humanas à sua frente fossem apenas peças em algum jogo esquecido. Ele aguardava a resposta, talvez para decidir se interviria ou se simplesmente se voltaria para as sombras de onde tinha vindo. Erick tossiu, o sangue manchando seus lábios enquanto ele lutava para falar. \\"Meu nome é Erik, e esta é Lyanna,\\" disse ele, com a voz rouca de dor. \\"Somos de uma vila não muito distante, chamada Avilla.\\" Ele fez uma pausa para respirar, cada fôlego parecendo consumir o que lhe restava de força. \\"Estávamos escoltando Lyanna para o reino de Askov, onde ela se casaria com o príncipe Ivan, mas fomos emboscados por mercenários. Eles nos atacaram sem aviso, roubam tudo. Apesar de nossos melhores esforços, foram implacáveis.\\" A testa de Erik estava coberta de suor frio, e seus olhos suplicantes buscavam qualquer sinal de compaixão em seus estranhos salvadores. “Tsk. Isso não tem nada a ver conosco. Arya, vamos.” Malakai estava visivelmente impaciente, pronto para descartar a situação como mais um evento trivial na existência humana. Mas Arya hesitou, o peso da própria busca por justiça tornando impossível ignorar o apelo por ajuda. Erick e Lyanna estavam vulneráveis, seus destinos pendurados por um fio tão fino quanto a borda afiada da katana de Arya. A samurai abaixou sua arma lentamente, o aço frio refletindo a luz da lua enquanto ela tomava sua decisão. “Kailus.” Era uma ordem simples, mas carregava o peso de uma aliança não dita entre eles. Malakai, o Supremo Soberano, com todo o seu poder e indiferença, encontrou-se diante de um dilema raro, provocado pela intensidade do olhar de Arya. \\"O que você está planejando, Arya?\\" Malakai perguntou, sua voz revelando uma ponta de interesse verdadeiro misturado com sua habitual arrogância. “Eu vou ajudar vocês a chegarem em segurança até o reino de Askov,\\" Arya afirmou, a determinação em sua voz tão afiada quanto a lâmina que ela carregava. Erick e Lyanna trocaram um olhar atônito, mal acreditando na oferta inesperada de auxílio. O soldado acenou com a cabeça, a gratidão evidente mesmo diante do esforço para se manter consciente. \\"Obrigado,\\" ele murmurou, o alívio momentâneo quebrando sua expressão dolorida. “O que? Arya, você não pode estar falando sério,” Malakai retrucou, a incredulidade tingindo sua voz. Ele caminhou até Arya, sua estatura dominando a cena. “Não é da sua conta, Kailus,” Arya respondeu sem rodeios, seus olhos fixos em Malakai, desafiando-o a contradizer sua decisão. “Eu faço o que eu achar certo.” “Você…” Malakai começou, a frustração evidente em seu rosto, antes de suspirar e passar a mão pelos cabelos prateados. “Farei isso por você, Arya. Mas não pense que isso se tornará um hábito.” “Obrigada…” Erick falou, querendo saber o nome deles. “Meu nome é Arya. E ele é…” Quando a luz da lua iluminou o rosto de Malakai, Erick e Lyanna reconheceram imediatamente aquela figura magnífica e aterradora. Eles se ajoelharam imediatamente, o medo e a reverência misturando-se em suas expressões. \\"Supremo Soberano Malakai,\\" eles murmuraram, suas vozes tremendo pela proximidade com a entidade que conheciam apenas por lendas e sussurros na escuridão da noite. Malakai olhou para eles, um brilho ambíguo em seus olhos vermelhos. “Levante-se,” ele ordenou, sua voz carregada de uma autoridade que não necessitava de qualquer reforço. Erick e Lyanna se levantaram, ainda abalados pela presença do ser mais poderoso que conheciam, mas reconfortados pela proteção que ele oferecia. Arya observava a cena, uma faísca de satisfação em seus olhos por ter convencido Malakai a ajudar. Ela sabia que a estrada para Askov seria longa e perigosa, e a presença de Malakai seria uma vantagem inestimável, ou uma constante irritação. Arya se aproximou da assustada Lyanna, removendo seu manto grosso e envolvendo-o em torno da jovem mulher. Lyanna, ainda trêmula pela presença de Malakai e pela brutalidade do ataque que haviam sofrido, aceitou o gesto com um aceno de cabeça agradecido. “Você precisa se manter aquecida,” disse Arya com uma voz suave que raramente usava. “A noite vai ser ainda mais fria.” Erick, observando a troca, sentiu um calor no peito, uma centelha de esperança em meio ao frio implacável. “Obrigado. Obrigado. Sorte nossa encontrar uma pessoa como você e... o Supremo Soberano.\\" Malakai virou as costas, parecendo impaciente com os agradecimentos e formalidades. \\"Não temos tempo para sentimentalismos,\\" ele interrompeu, \\"a noite não está mais segura do que antes e precisamos nos mover.\\" Erick e Lyanna assentiram, reconhecendo a urgência na voz do imperador. Arya começou a liderar o caminho, sua postura confiante cortando a tensão do grupo. Mesmo com a presença de Malakai, ela não deixou sua guarda baixar, cada sentido alerta para o perigo que possivelmente ainda os aguardava. Eles avistaram uma caverna e decidiram que seria um bom local para se abrigarem durante a noite. A entrada era espaçosa o suficiente para que todos pudessem entrar sem se agachar, e o interior se estendia na escuridão, prometendo alguma proteção contra o vento cortante lá fora. Malakai entrou primeiro, os olhos vermelhos brilhando enquanto ele inspecionava o lugar. \\"Não é um palácio,\\" ele zombou, \\"mas vai servir.\\" Com cuidado, Arya ajudou Erick e Lyanna a se acomodarem no fundo da caverna. “Kailus. Fogo.” Era apenas um comando simples, mas suficiente para que Malakai, com um aceno de mão, conjurasse chamas em um pequeno fosso de pedras que Arya tinha arranjado. As labaredas iluminavam as paredes da caverna, lançando sombras dançantes que pareciam suavizar as feições duras de Malakai. Erick e Lyanna se aqueciam junto ao fogo, suas expressões cansadas, mas aliviadas por estarem vivos e sob a proteção de figuras tão poderosas e inesperadas. “Acho que tenho água e comida em minha bolsa,” Arya disse, revirando seus pertences. Ela retirou um pequeno pote de barro com água e um embrulho com alguns pães duros de viagem. “Está um pouco seco, mas vai matar a fome.” Erick conseguiu um sorriso fraco, acenando com a cabeça em gratidão. “Qualquer coisa é um banquete agora,” respondeu ele, aceitando a generosidade da samurai. Lyanna, ainda encolhida perto do fogo, olhou para Arya com olhos agradecidos. “Mas e você?” Arya olhou para o fundo da bolsa, vendo que não tinha mais nada. “Tudo bem. Não estou com fome agora,” ela respondeu, disfarçando a própria necessidade. Erick assentiu, compreendendo a fibra da pessoa que os havia salvado, e partilhou o pão com Lyanna. Ao comerem, o silêncio reinava, quebrado apenas pelo crepitar das chamas e pelo som abafado do vento lá fora. Malakai observava a cena, o fogo refletindo em seus olhos avermelhados, dando-lhe uma aparência quase humana. Quando Arya se levantou, ele seguia-a com o olhar, um misto de curiosidade e uma pontada de preocupação em sua expressão usualmente desdenhosa. \\"Vai aonde?\\" ele perguntou, a voz baixa o suficiente para não atrair a atenção de Erick e Lyanna. \\"Vou verificar a entrada,\\" Arya respondeu, segurando sua katana com firmeza. \\"Precisamos ter certeza de que estamos seguros aqui.\\" Malakai assentiu, levantando-se para acompanhá-la. Erick e Lyanna observaram enquanto os dois desapareciam na penumbra que antecedia a saída da caverna, as sombras dançantes do fogo tornando suas figuras quase etéreas. Arya e Malakai alcançaram a entrada da caverna, onde a luz do luar filtrava-se tenuemente através das nuvens carregadas de neve. Com a katana empunhada, Arya inspecionava cada canto, buscando sinais que denunciassem a presença de mais inimigos ou criaturas noturnas. Malakai tocou o braço de Arya levemente, sentindo o quão fria ela estava apesar de sua postura rígida. \\"Você deveria ter ficado com o manto,\\" ele disse, a preocupação rompendo a barreira de sua indiferença habitual. Arya deu de ombros, sua atenção ainda focada no exterior escuro e ameaçador. \\"Lyanna precisava mais dele,\\" respondeu ela simplesmente, como se o ato de generosidade fosse a coisa mais natural do mundo. \\"Mal os conhece e já está dando suas roupas e comida. Você é idiota ou o que?\\" Malakai provocou, embora o tom de sua voz tivesse traços de admiração. \\"Não é idiotice, Kailus,\\" Arya replicou, a voz firme. \\"É humanidade, algo que talvez você tenha esquecido ao longo dos séculos.\\" Houve um breve silêncio, durante o qual apenas o som suave da neve caindo podia ser ouvido. Malakai olhou para Arya, seus olhos vermelhos brilhando com uma intensidade incomum. “Se eles se tornarem um peso para você, o que você tenha que arriscar sua vida por eles… eu os matarei. Sem nem pensar duas vezes,” ele declarou, a voz destilando uma ameaça fria. Arya manteve o olhar fixo no horizonte noturno, a respiração tornando-se visível em pequenas nuvens de vapor. Por um instante, ela se perguntou se a frieza do imperador demoníaco seria capaz de rivalizar com o gelo que se acumulava ao seu redor. Ela sabia que Malakai não falava em vão, e a promessa de morte era tão real quanto o sangue que corria em suas veias. \\"Não precisará matá-los,\\" Arya disse finalmente, virando-se para enfrentá-lo. \\"Não vou deixar que se tornem um peso. Eu protejo aqueles com quem me importo, não importa o custo.\\" Malakai observou-a, o leve franzir de sua testa indicando uma rara confusão. \\"Eles mal conhecem você, e você mal os conhece. Por que se importa tanto?\\" sua voz era quase um sussurro, como se ele realmente desejasse entender. “EU PRECISO DISSO PARA ME LEMBRAR DE QUE AINDA SOU HUMANA, KAILUS!\\" Arya tapou a boca rapidamente, percebendo a intensidade de sua própria voz. A emoção borbulhava sob sua superfície calma, e o olhar em seus olhos era ardente, entregando a ferida aberta que era a memória do extermínio de seu clã. Tantos anos buscando vingança, matando sem hesitação aqueles que ficavam em seu caminho, Arya começou a sentir o peso de suas ações e a temer que o fio que a ligava à humanidade estivesse se desgastando. A preocupação de se tornar o que ela mais odiava a assombrava, e ajudar Erick e Lyanna oferecia uma tênue esperança de redenção, um antídoto para o veneno da vingança que corria em suas veias. “Ah… agora eu entendi. Não quer aceitar que está se tornando algo como eu.” Malakai inclinou a cabeça ligeiramente, um sorriso irônico tocando seus lábios enquanto observava a samurai. Arya desviou o olhar, focando novamente no vazio para além da entrada da caverna. As palavras dele, embora cruéis, tinham um fio de verdade que ela não podia ignorar. Arya temia a possibilidade de seus métodos e seu coração endurecido a transformarem em uma sombra do demônio que caminhava ao seu lado. \\"Eu nunca serei como você, Kailus,\\" Arya respondeu, a definição em sua voz era como o aço de sua katana. \\"Minhas ações têm propósito, não são caprichos de poder e tédio.\\" Malakai traçou uma unha negra pela linha da mandíbula dela, com um toque que poderia ser tão letal quanto carinhoso. \\"Você se agarra ao seu propósito como uma criança a uma manta, Arya,\\" ele murmurou, cada palavra carregada com um significado que apenas seres como ele poderiam compreender plenamente. \\"Mas eu vejo a verdade nos seus olhos. A batalha que você trava não é apenas contra aqueles que destruíram seu clã. É uma luta contra a escuridão que ameaça engolir sua alma.\\" Arya bateu na mão de Malakai, afastando-a de seu rosto com uma mistura de irritação e vulnerabilidade. “Eu sei muito bem com o que estou lutando,” ela disse, desafiando-o com a força de sua vontade. “Agora vamos voltar. Erick e Lyanna precisam de nós. E Kailus, não entre mais na minha cabeça. Não é seu lugar.” Malakai ergueu uma sobrancelha, o desafio de Arya despertando nele uma fascinação ainda maior pela complexidade humana. “Como quiser, Arya,” ele concedeu, o tom de sua voz misturando diversão e um respeito relutante. Eles retornaram ao calor da caverna, encontrando Erick e Lyanna aconchegados perto do fogo, a exaustão vencendo o medo e a tensão. Arya se sentou silenciosamente, sua katana sempre ao alcance, enquanto Malakai se recostava contra a parede rochosa, observando a interação humana com um olhar distante. Entediado, ele se aproximou da jovem Lyanna, que encolhia-se junto ao fogo, seus olhos arregalados e fixos nas chamas hipnóticas. Malakai observou-a por um momento, a curiosidade pueril de um ser antigo refletida em seus olhos vermelhos. “Quantos anos você tem?” Lyanna levantou os olhos para Malakai, seu olhar ainda carregado de um medo reverencial diante do ser poderoso à sua frente. \\"Eu... eu tenho dezessete anos, Supremo Soberano,\\" ela respondeu, sua voz quase um sussurro, enquanto se esforçava para manter a compostura na presença dele. “Você… não quer se casar com o príncipe, não é?” Lyanna hesitou, a surpresa de ser questionada por uma entidade como Malakai misturada com a súbita oportunidade de desabafar seu coração. Ela olhou para Erik, que dormia ao seu lado, e sentiu uma pontada de culpa ao admitir a verdade diante de estranhos. \\"Eu... Eu nunca desejei isso,\\" ela confessou, baixando os olhos. \\"Foi uma escolha feita para mim, para assegurar a segurança e o futuro da minha vila. Eu mal conheço o príncipe Ivan.\\" “Eu posso ver. Tudo pelo seu pai, Scar, líder da aldeia, e a querida mamãe, Sarah.” Lyanna olhou para Malakai com assombro, perguntando-se como ele poderia saber os nomes de seus pais e os detalhes de sua vida. “Como...?” Uma pedra atingiu a cabeça de Malakai com uma força suficiente para irritar, mas não para ferir. \\"Pare de entrar na mente das pessoas sem permissão,\\" Arya repreendeu, sua expressão um misto de desaprovação e alerta. \\"E pare de assustar Lyanna.\\" Malakai passou a mão por onde a pedra o atingira, um sorriso perverso emergindo em seus lábios. \\"Ah, mas é tão divertido,\\" ele zombou, mas havia um tom de advertência em sua voz. Arya se aproximou e o puxou pela orelha, utilizando o gesto como uma repreensão física à infantilidade do Supremo Soberano. \\"Kailus, controle-se,\\" ela sibilou, sua voz baixa e firme. \\"Não estamos aqui para jogos.\\" Malakai grunhiu levemente, mas o brilho em seus olhos traía sua diversão. \\"Você sempre soube como acabar com a minha diversão, Arya,\\" ele resmungou, afastando-se dela e esfregando a orelha. Erik acordou com um sobressalto, a confusão evidente em seu rosto enquanto ele tentava entender a cena diante dele. A luz do fogo dançava sobre as feições de Arya e Malakai, um contraste bizarro de calor humano e distanciamento sobrenatural. \\"O que aconteceu?\\" Erik perguntou, sua voz ainda rouca do sono e da dor. \\"Tivemos um pequeno... desacordo. Nada com que se preocupar,\\" Arya respondeu rapidamente, lançando um olhar repreensivo em direção a Malakai, que respondeu com um encolher de ombros descuidado. “Por que você o chama de Kailus, Arya?” Lyanna perguntou timidamente, o brilho das chamas refletido em seus olhos ansiosos. Havia uma curiosidade inocente em sua expressão, um desejo de entender a relação entre a feroz samurai e esse ser de poder incomensurável. Arya olhou para Lyanna, percebendo a inocência e a curiosidade pura nos olhos da jovem. Ela hesitou por um momento, ciente de que cada detalhe que compartilhava sobre Malakai aumentava o vínculo entre eles, um vínculo que ela sabia ser perigoso. Mas havia algo na forma como Lyanna perguntou, um anseio por compreender o incompreensível, que fez Arya querer responder. “Kailus foi o nome que ele deu a si mesmo quando o mundo ainda estava em sua infância, uma era de silêncio e de possibilidades infinitas. Ele andou entre as estrelas e viu civilizações nascerem e perecerem. Com o tempo, o peso de ser único em sua habilidade começou a pressioná-lo. Ele precisava de um nome que impusesse respeito e distância, um título que ressoasse com poder e domínio. Assim nasceu Malakai, o Supremo Soberano.” “Arya. Pare.” A voz de Malakai interrompeu o momento, a autoridade em sua fala era indiscutível. Arya fechou a boca, passando um olhar apreensivo para ele. O imperador demoníaco encarava-a com uma intensidade que fazia o ar em volta vibrar com um poder quase palpável. Por um breve segundo, o ambiente da caverna tensionou-se, como se o próprio tempo aguardasse a próxima palavra de Malakai. “Só para deixar claro, se eu ouvir algum de vocês dois chamando-me de Kailus, farei questão de lembrá-los de quem eu sou. Não é um nome para ser usado levianamente ou sem a devida permissão.” Malakai falava com a frieza de uma noite sem estrelas, e seu olhar era inabalável. Contudo, sua postura era de alguém que protegia algo íntimo, algo que só Arya tinha o direito de conhecer. Erik e Lyanna se entreolharam com um misto de medo e entendimento. Não ousariam desafiar a palavra do Supremo Soberano, não quando suas vidas penduravam-se por um fio tão delicado quanto a paciência de Malakai. A caverna estava agora em silêncio, exceto pelo crepitar do fogo e pelo som abafado do vento lá fora. Cada um voltou-se para seus próprios pensamentos, refletindo sobre a estranha trégua entre a luz e a escuridão que se formara entre Arya e Malakai. A barriga de Lyanna começou a roncar, rompendo a quietude da caverna com um som humano demasiado comum. O constrangimento tingiu suas faces, e ela envolveu os braços em torno do estômago, como se pudesse silenciar a fome que revelava sua vulnerabilidade. “Eu vou caçar.” Arya levantou-se abruptamente, percebendo a necessidade imediata. Ela pegou a katana e dirigiu-se à entrada da caverna. Malakai olhou para ela, um traço de desaprovação em seu rosto. “Não precisa se incomodar com isso. Posso simplesmente criar o que precisam.” Arya parou, virando-se para encará-lo. “Não. Eles precisam de algo real, algo tangível. Não de magia ou ilusões.” Malakai suspirou, levantando-se com uma elegância preguiçosa. Ele abriu um pequeno portal negro, de onde dois coelhos saltaram para a caverna, assustados, mas ilesos. Um brilho de magia negra ainda circulava-os por um segundo antes de se dissipar completamente, revelando a autenticidade de suas formas. “Não é ilusão,” Malakai afirmou, um traço de desafio em sua voz. “São reais, tão reais quanto qualquer criatura que corre por essas florestas.” Arya olhou para os coelhos, a desconfiança ainda marcada em seu rosto, mas a necessidade de alimentar seus companheiros temporários falava mais alto. Ela suspirou, seu orgulho cedendo à praticidade da situação. \\"Está bem,\\" ela disse, sua voz baixa, mas não sem um toque de gratidão relutante. Erick, agora desperto e atento, olhou com surpresa para os animais que surgiram do nada. Lyanna, ainda com as bochechas coradas de constrangimento, sorriu com a perspectiva de uma refeição quente. Malakai, satisfeito por ter ajudado, apesar da teimosia de Arya, não conseguiu evitar um sorriso arrogante. \\"Eu vou prepará-los para cozinhar,\\" Arya proclamou, levantando-se para pegar os coelhos. Ela lançou um olhar significativo para Malakai, que apenas deu de ombros, fingindo desinteresse enquanto observava a samurai trabalhar. Com movimentos habilidosos e precisos, Arya limpou e preparou os coelhos para a fogueira. O calor do fogo logo foi substituído pelo cheiro tentador de carne cozinhando, e mesmo a tensão que antes permeava a caverna pareceu se dissolver um pouco sob a promessa de uma refeição substancial. Enquanto a carne sibilava e dourava sobre as chamas, Arya sentou-se, cruzando as pernas e observando a comida com um olhar atento. Malakai, incapaz de resistir à oportunidade de provocar, aproximou-se dela, sentando-se um pouco mais perto do que o necessário. Malakai inclinou-se em direção a Arya, seus ombros quase se tocando, e Arya sentiu o calor que emanava dele contrastar com o frio da caverna. “Cheiro bom…” Malakai respirou fundo, o aroma da carne assando preenchendo o espaço estreito da caverna. Arya manteve-se focada na fogueira, mas podia sentir a presença dominadora de Malakai tão perto, uma presença que trazia tanto conforto quanto perigo. \\"E o que você sabe sobre cheiros bons? Não me parece que comer seja uma necessidade para você,\\" Arya provocou, mantendo sua voz neutra, mas não suficientemente para esconder a curiosidade. “Eu não estava me referindo a carne.” Ele se aproximou do pescoço de Arya, respirando o aroma peculiar que vinha de sua pele. \\"Eu estava falando de algo bem mais... atraente.\\" Malakai lambeu a linha de seu pescoço delicadamente, provocando um arrepio que correu pela espinha de Arya, apesar de sua determinação de não demonstrar fraqueza diante dele. O gesto íntimo era um lembrete de sua natureza predatória e da tensão sempre presente entre eles. Aproximando-se ainda mais, Malakai sussurrou em seu ouvido, com uma voz que misturava promessa e perigo. \\"Sua determinação e força tornam você irresistível, Arya. Não é de admirar que eu não consiga ficar longe.\\" Arya pegou um graveto próximo e o quebrou na cabeça de Malakai, uma reprimenda clara e física à sua provocação audaciosa. Malakai recuou, um sorriso ainda brincando nos cantos de seus lábios. A irritação de Arya não era novidade para ele, mas cada reação dela só servia para aumentar o seu fascínio pela samurai humana. “Você realmente precisa aprender a controlar esse seu temperamento,” Malakai comentou, esfregando o local onde o graveto atingira. Seu tom era brincalhão, mas havia uma provocação subjacente. “Idiota.” Arya resmungou, sem se virar para olhá-lo. \\"Apenas certifique-se de que não se aproxime novamente assim. Não estou brincando, Malakai.\\" A carne estava agora pronta, e o cheiro agradável preenchia a caverna, oferecendo um consolo bem-vindo. Arya retirou os coelhos da fogueira com cuidado, colocando-os em um prato improvisado feito de folhas grandes que ela havia coletado. Erick e Lyanna observavam, as expressões de fome em seus rostos substituídas por olhares de agradecimento. “Sirva-se” Arya disse, estendendo o prato em direção a Lyanna e Erick. \\"Comam enquanto está quente.\\" Erick pegou um pedaço, sorrindo para Arya em agradecimento. Ainda enfraquecido, ele tomou um cuidado extra para não fazer movimentos bruscos que pudessem irritar suas feridas. Lyanna, mais reservada, mas claramente aliviada, aceitou sua parte com um gesto de cabeça grato. Enquanto comiam, Arya se afastou ligeiramente, mantendo uma distância respeitosa para dar-lhes algum espaço. Malakai a segui, sentando-se ao lado dela com uma familiaridade que desafiava sua natureza enigmática. “Também estou com fome, sabia?” Ele disse, com um toque de teatralidade na voz. Arya virou-se para ele, os olhos estreitando-se enquanto ela avaliava se ele estava falando sério. \\"Você não come esse tipo de comida,\\" Arya respondeu, com uma ponta de sarcasmo. \\"Você só se alimenta de… Não. De modo algum.” Droga. Ele estava com fome de sangue. “Kailus, não a—” Ele tapou a boca de Arya rapidamente com a mão, seus olhos vermelhos agora ardendo com uma intensidade feroz que não deixava margem para argumentos. “Só um pouquinho, Arya. Eles não vão nem notar,\\" ele sussurrou, sua voz um misto de sedução e ameaça. A mão de Malakai ainda cobria a boca de Arya, impedindo qualquer som de escapar. Seus olhos encontraram os dela, o fogo refletindo neles, criando um jogo de luz e sombras que parecia dançar com a tensão do momento. O olhar de Malakai era um redemoinho de desejo e impulso primitivo, mas mesmo nas profundezas daquele abismo vermelho, uma faísca de hesitação brilhava. Arya, cujo coração batia com a força de um tambor de guerra, conhecia aquele olhar muito bem. Era o mesmo olhar que a acompanhava desde o dia em que encontrou o imperador caído na estrada, o mesmo olhar que carregava a dualidade de seu ser: o poder supremo e a solidão infinita. “Espere eles dormirem, e eu te darei o necessário.” A voz de Arya era um sussurro, uma promessa sibilada que carregava o peso de sua própria resolução. Ela conhecia o risco que estava assumindo, mas também entendia o delicado equilíbrio de poder entre eles. Malakai retirou a mão de sua boca lentamente, o contato de seus dedos deixando um rastro de calor na pele de Arya. Ele assentiu uma vez, reconhecendo a concessão dela e a confiança implícita que isso representava. “Certo. Eu vou esperar,” Malakai concordou, recuando para permitir que Arya respirasse mais livremente. Seu olhar ainda permanecia nela, uma chama de gratidão e algo mais indefinível ardia em seus olhos. Com um gesto de cabeça, ele se afastou e começou a caminhar em direção à outra extremidade da caverna, mas não sem antes lançar um olhar sobre o ombro, um sorriso quase imperceptível tocando seus lábios. Arya observou Malakai se afastar, sentindo uma mistura de alívio e apreensão agitar-se em seu peito. Ela se virou para Erick e Lyanna, que agora estavam satisfeitos e sonolentos pelo calor do fogo e pela refeição que tinham acabado de compartilhar. “Vocês devem descansar,” aconselhou Arya suavemente. “Nós temos um longo caminho pela frente amanhã.” Erick assentiu com a cabeça, agradecendo outra vez com um olhar sincero. “Não sei como poderemos agradecer por tudo que vocês estão fazendo por nós,” ele disse, sua voz cheia de gratidão. Erick concordou, suas pálpebras agora pesadas pelo cansaço. Lyanna já havia se aconchegado mais perto do fogo, deixando-se levar pelo abraço acolhedor do sono. Com sua respiração se tornando mais lenta e profunda, o casal logo sucumbiu ao descanso merecido, deixando Arya e Malakai em vigília. Arya se levantou silenciosamente, caminhando até a entrada da caverna para mais uma vez verificar o perímetro. Ela podia sentir a presença de Malakai atrás dela, a quietude dele um contraste com a voracidade que sabia estar espreitando logo abaixo da superfície calma. \\"Por que me olha tanto?” A voz de Arya quebrou o silêncio, carregada de leves notas de desafio e curiosidade. Ela não se virou para encarar Malakai, mas pôde sentir a intensidade do olhar dele em suas costas, uma presença quase física. “Eles dormiram.” A voz de Malakai parecia vir de todos os lados, uma reverberação que preenchia a caverna com uma promessa silenciosa. Arya sabia o que aquilo significava. Ela suspirou, a determinação endurecendo suas feições sob a luz fria da lua que se infiltrava pela entrada da caverna. Girando nos calcanhares, ela encarou Malakai, os olhos amarelos brilhando com uma luz própria, um farol no escuro que desafiava a escuridão à sua frente. “Está na hora,” ela disse, a voz baixa, mas firme, carregada com a aceitação de seu acordo. Malakai aproximou-se, o ar ao seu redor vibrando com uma energia que parecia alterar a própria gravidade do lugar. Assumindo uma postura desafiadora, Arya esperou, pronta para cumprir sua palavra, mas também alerta para qualquer sinal de excesso por parte de Malakai. O Supremo Soberano observou-a por um momento, medindo-a não apenas com os olhos, mas com todos os sentidos, percebendo cada batida acelerada de seu coração, cada respiração contida. Então, com uma suavidade que contrastava com a violência que muitas vezes acompanhava sua natureza, ele aproximou-se ainda mais, um dos seus braços rodeando a cintura de Arya para trazê-la para perto. Com a outra mão, ele afastou delicadamente os cabelos negros de seu pescoço, expondo a pele pálida à Lua e ao desejo que ele mal conseguia conter. “Deliciosa…” Ele a empurrou para trás de uma parede que estava a poucos passos de distância, seus olhos vermelhos fixos nos dela com uma intensidade que parecia atravessar a própria alma. Arya, embora firme, não pôde evitar a onda de incerteza que a invadiu. Malakai era um ser de poder incomensurável, e ela, apesar de destemida, ainda era mortal. Malakai inclinou-se, sua respiração quente contra a pele fria de Arya, fazendo com que ela se arrepiasse involuntariamente. Ela fechou os olhos, preparando-se para a sensação de seus caninos perfurando a pele. “Ah!” A dor aguda foi rápida, mas mais intensa do que Arya esperava. Malakai sentiu o sangue quente de Arya fluir para sua boca, um gosto que era ao mesmo tempo uma indulgência e um lembrete de sua eterna maldição. Arya, com seus olhos ainda fechados, sentiu as forças fugindo rapidamente, mas confiava em Malakai, ou talvez confiasse em sua própria capacidade de pará-lo se ele fosse longe demais. Ela podia sentir a mão dele firme em sua cintura, não apenas como um ato possessivo, mas também como um suporte, como se ele reconhecesse a necessidade de mantê-la de pé enquanto tomava o que precisava para saciar sua fome ancestral. Através do contato, um entendimento silencioso era compartilhado entre eles; um pacto que não precisava de palavras para ser selado. A medida que Malakai bebia, o mundo de Arya começou a girar, as paredes da caverna se fundindo em uma espiral de cores e sombras. Ela soube, com a clareza que antecede a inconsciência, que ele se detinha na beira do que seria demais, calculando cada gole com uma precisão que desmentia seu comportamento usualmente desdenhoso. “Kailus… chega.” Malakai parou imediatamente ao ouvir a voz enfraquecida de Arya, a urgência em sua palavra de comando ecoando na escuridão da caverna como um sino de advertência. Ele se afastou, um filete de sangue ainda escorrendo pelo canto de sua boca, seus olhos vermelhos refletindo uma mistura de satisfação e preocupação. Ele a pegou nos braços antes que ela pudesse desabar, a força em seu corpo dissipada pelo gesto íntimo que haviam compartilhado. A respiração de Arya era superficial e irregular, mas ela estava consciente, seus olhos amarelos brilhando com uma luz fraca que ainda detinha o poder de seu espírito indomável. “Você está bem?” Malakai perguntou, a preocupação em sua voz um contraste com o tom autoritário que normalmente usava. Arya assentiu levemente, tentando reunir sua força. “Sim, apenas... fraca. Dê-me um momento.” Sua voz era um sussurro, mas ainda assim carregado com a firmeza que a caracterizava. Malakai a levou de volta ao calor reconfortante da fogueira, depositando-a suavemente no chão. A luz das chamas iluminava seu rosto, destacando a palidez que tomara conta de sua pele. Ele observou enquanto a respiração de Arya se tornava mais regular, os sinais de recuperação começando a aparecer. Com o rosto de Arya banhado pelo brilho da fogueira, Malakai observou-a com uma intensidade incomum, a preocupação evidente em seu semblante. Não era comum para o Supremo Soberano sentir algo tão próximo da ansiedade, mas Arya não era uma presença comum em sua existência infinita. Arya, por sua vez, lutava para manter os olhos abertos, a fraqueza em seu corpo uma sensação estranha e perturbadora. \\"Eu preciso... de água,\\" ela murmurou, a garganta seca e a língua áspera após o contato com a fome voraz de Malakai. Sem hesitar, Malakai moveu-se com uma velocidade que desafiava a percepção humana, retornando momentos depois com um cantil de água fresca. Ele ergueu a cabeça de Arya delicadamente, apoiando-a contra seu joelho enquanto levava o cantil aos seus lábios. \\"Beba lentamente,\\" ele instruiu, sua voz baixa e calmante, um tom raramente utilizado. A água fria desceu pela garganta de Arya como uma bênção, cada gole trazendo um pouco mais de vida à sua expressão cansada. A luz do fogo dançava em seu rosto, lançando um brilho sobre as linhas determinadas de sua mandíbula. Ela devolveu o cantil a Malakai com um aceno de cabeça agradecido, seus olhos encontrando os dele por um momento e reconhecendo um lampejo de... seria preocupação? Malakai parecia prestes a dizer algo, sua postura rígida e a forma como ele desviava o olhar do dela eram incomuns. Ele estava acostumado a olhar para o mundo e suas criaturas com indiferença ou desdém, mas com Arya, as coisas eram diferentes. “Você nunca demonstrou preocupação assim antes,” Arya observou, a voz ainda fraca, mas sua mente clara como cristal. “Isso me faz pensar se você está começando a se sentir... humano.” O Supremo Soberano soltou uma risada seca. “Humano? Eu? Não seja ridícula, Arya. Eu apenas... reconheço a vantagem de ter você ao meu lado.” Ele se afastou um pouco, desconfortável com a direção da conversa. Pelo que parece, Arya havia desmaiado pois acordou com a luz do amanhecer lhe beijando o rosto, e uma capa pesada a cobrindo – com certeza, trabalho de Malakai. Sua cabeça ainda girava um pouco, mas ela sentia-se bem melhor agora que o descanso havia permitido a seu corpo começar a se recuperar da perda de sangue. Lyanna e Erik já estavam acordados, arrumando suas coisas. “Por que não me acordaram?” Arya perguntou, sua voz ainda carregando um traço da fadiga do dia anterior. “Você parecia estar precisando do descanso,” respondeu Erik com um sorriso gentil, mas preocupado. “Além disso… o Supremo Soberano disse que arrancaria nossas mãos se tentássemos acordá-la,\\" terminou ele, lançando um olhar nervoso na direção onde Malakai havia se recolhido na sombra de uma formação rochosa. “Ah… esse idiota.” Arya se sentou, afastando a capa pesada que Malakai havia colocado sobre ela durante a noite. Ela esticou os membros dormentes, sentindo o formigamento desconfortável que percorria seus braços e pernas à medida que circulação retornava ao normal. Olhando ao redor, ela viu Malakai afastado, sua figura imponente recortada contra o nascer do sol que banhava a entrada da caverna com tons de laranja e vermelho. “Malakai,” Arya chamou, sua voz mais firme agora que ela havia recuperado parte de sua energia. Ela se aproximou dele, cada passo marcado por uma determinação que compensava o desconforto que ainda sentia. “Vamos. Nós chegaremos em Askov em três dias se mantivermos um bom ritmo,” Ela disse, esperando que ele se levantasse e se juntasse a eles. Malakai apenas olhou para ela, a luz do amanhecer refletindo nos seus olhos escarlate, dando-lhes um brilho quase sobrenatural. “Três dias, huh?” Malakai finalmente se levantou, a capa negra que usava ondulando com o movimento. “Muito bem, mas espero que não esteja planejando fazer mais paradas heroicas pelo caminho.” Quando sairam da caverna, a neve havia parado e a grama sob seus pés estava coberta por uma fina camada de gelo. O ar frio da manhã parecia mais suportável agora que o sol começava a escalar o céu, prometendo um dia mais claro do que o anterior. Erik e Lyanna seguiam à frente, o rapaz ainda caminhando com dificuldade devido aos ferimentos, mas determinado a não atrasar o grupo. Lyanna, por sua vez, mantinha-se perto de Erik, oferecendo apoio sempre que ele vacilava. “Eu ainda não entrei na sua mente, jovem Erik.” A voz de Malakai surgiu repentinamente, rompendo o silêncio que havia se instalado entre o grupo durante a caminhada matinal. As palavras, ditas de forma casual, congelaram Erik em seu lugar, fazendo-o virar-se para encarar o Supremo Soberano com uma mistura de confusão e alarme. Erik permaneceu imóvel, sua respiração acelerada e seus olhos fixos em Malakai, tentando entender o significado por trás de suas palavras. Focado em Erik, Malakai captou tudo: A aldeia, sua esposa Celeste, o filhinho de apenas um ano que tinha deixado para trás, a ordem do líder de escoltar Lyanna, a sensação de falha ao não conseguir protegê-la dos mercenários, a dor das feridas que ainda latejavam em seu corpo. Foi uma leitura rápida, mas profunda, um mergulho nos medos e esperanças de Erik. Erik levou a mão ao nariz de repente, sentindo o sangue quente e espesso correr por entre seus dedos. Ele cambaleou, surpreendido pela invasão súbita de Malakai em sua mente, uma violação que o deixou desnorteado e vulnerável. Arya, com uma destreza que desmentia seu estado ainda fragilizado, rapidamente agarrou Malakai pelos cabelos prateados, puxando-o com força para trás. A surpresa de Malakai foi evidente; ele não esperava uma reação tão física de Arya, especialmente depois do que havia acontecido entre eles na noite anterior. “O que pensa que está fazendo?” Arya vociferou, a raiva feroz em sua voz fazendo com que até mesmo o Supremo Soberano hesitasse. “Prometi protegê-los, e não permitirei que brinque com a mente de alguém da minha proteção.” Malakai olhou para Arya, sua surpresa inicial dando lugar a um sorriso arrogante que desafiava a fúria em seus olhos amarelos. \\"Eu estava apenas curioso,\\" ele respondeu, sua voz contendo um traço de diversão que só serviu para inflamar ainda mais a ira de Arya. “Curiosidade não lhe dá o direito de invadir a mente alheia. Erik é um humano, não um brinquedo para sua diversão!” Arya manteve a mão firme nos cabelos de Malakai, pronta para puxá-lo novamente se ele mostrasse qualquer sinal de resistência. Erik, ainda segurando o nariz ensanguentado, olhou para Arya com uma mistura de gratidão e temor. A samurai não apenas havia salvado sua vida e de Lyanna, mas agora também os defendia do ser mais temido e poderoso que conheciam. “Eu entendo a sua proteção para com eles, Arya, mas não precisa ser tão... física,” Malakai disse, tentando recuperar sua postura habitual de indiferença. “Argh! Estou indo embora por enquanto.” Malakai se afastou com um movimento fluido e arrogante, a irritação em seu rosto tão evidente quanto a neve que ainda cobria o chão. Com um olhar irritado para Arya, ele desapareceu em um vórtice escuro que se fechou com um suspiro silencioso, deixando para trás apenas o frio que acompanhava sua magia. Arya soltou o ar que não sabia que estava segurando, seus olhos ainda fixos no espaço onde Malakai havia estado. Ela relaxou ligeiramente, mas a tensão em seus ombros não desapareceu completamente. \\"Ele vai voltar,\\" ela murmurou mais para si mesma do que para Erik ou Lyanna. \\"Ele sempre volta.\\" Há noite, eles tinham apenas 3 grãos de nozes para comerem. Arya olhou para os três grãos de nozes nas palmas de suas mãos, sentindo a ironia amarga de suas escassas provisões contra a vastidão da natureza ao seu redor. Erik e Lyanna, sentados do outro lado da fogueira, compartilhavam um olhar silencioso, suas expressões tensas revelando a preocupação sobre o que os aguardava na jornada seguinte. “Vamos dividir esses,” Arya disse, quebrando a quietude que havia se instalado. Ela estendeu um grão para cada um, mantendo o último para si. \\"Não é muito, mas manterá nossa força até encontrarmos mais comida.\\" “Se o Supremo Soberano estivesse aqui, ele poderia fazer comida para nós,\\" Lyanna murmurou, sua voz trêmula de fome e exaustão. Erik olhou para Arya antes de aceitar o grão de noz oferecido. \\"Não podemos depender dele para tudo. Arya já fez mais do que qualquer um poderia esperar.\\" Arya acenou com a cabeça em concordância e mastigou seu grão de noz devagar, tentando extrair cada última gota de energia que ele poderia oferecer. A luz da fogueira dançava em seus olhos, refletindo a determinação que ardiam dentro dela, uma chama que não seria extinta pela fome ou pelo frio. \\"Vou caçar,\\" Arya declarou de repente, levantando-se com uma agilidade que desmentia a fadiga que sentia. \\"Fiquem aqui e mantenham o fogo aceso. Eu voltarei em breve.\\" Erik e Lyanna acenaram, compreendendo a necessidade da ação de Arya. Ela se afastou da luz do fogo, desaparecendo na escuridão da floresta como uma sombra em busca de esperança. Arya avançava pela floresta escura, a neve abaixo de seus pés mascarando qualquer som que suas passadas pudessem produzir. A lua, um fino crescente no céu, oferecia pouca luz, deixando a samurai confiar mais em seu instinto do que em sua visão. Enquanto se movia com cuidado entre as árvores, seus olhos vasculhavam a escuridão em busca de qualquer sinal de vida. Ela sabia que a caça seria escassa, mas a fome que apertava seu estômago não deixava espaço para dúvidas ou hesitações. Cada movimento era calculado, cada respiração controlada, cada sentido em alerta máximo. Foi então que aconteceu. Um passo em falso, uma superfície instável sob a neve e, de repente, Arya sentiu seu pé afundar inesperadamente no que parecia ser um buraco oculto pela camada branca. A sensação de torção foi imediata, uma dor aguda irradiando por seu tornozelo. Um grunhido de dor escapou por entre seus dentes cerrados enquanto ela caía de joelhos na neve. Ela apertou o local ferido, a respiração se tornando mais rápida conforme lutava contra o pico de sofrimento. A adrenalina ainda pulsava em suas veias, mantendo a dor em um nível gerenciável, mas Arya sabia que isso não duraria muito. Então, um lobo branco GIGANTE surgiu do meio das sombras da floresta, seus olhos brilhantes como dois rubis refletindo a luz da lua. O lobo observava Arya com uma curiosidade predatória, a cabeça inclinada de lado enquanto avaliava a presa ferida diante de si. Arya congelou, seus olhos arregalados, fixos no lobo branco gigante que emergira das sombras. A voz que saiu do lobo era inesperadamente suave e profunda, vibrando com uma familiaridade que a confundia e aliviava ao mesmo tempo. \\"Isso parece estar doendo, Arya,\\" disse o lobo, sua fala clara e articulada de uma forma que nenhum animal normal poderia conseguir. A samurai ficou boquiaberta, a dor em seu tornozelo temporariamente esquecida diante da visão e da voz do lobo. \\"Malakai?\\" ela arriscou, a suspeita nascendo em sua mente enquanto observava os olhos rubi do lobo, tão semelhantes aos de Malakai. O lobo gigante sentou-se na neve, um sorriso quase humano brincando em seus lábios lupinos. \\"Você me conhece tão bem, Arya. Sim, sou eu. Achei que essa forma seria apropriada para uma caçada noturna,\\" Malakai disse, sua cauda branca varrendo a neve de maneira pensativa. Arya observou o lobo gigante, um misto de frustração e admiração marcando sua expressão enquanto tentava processar a transformação de Malakai. \\"Você pode mudar de forma agora?\\" ela perguntou, tentando manter a voz firme apesar da onda de dor que emanava de seu tornozelo. Malakai, ainda na forma de lobo, inclinou a cabeça em um gesto que evidenciava seu orgulho. \\"Eu sou o Supremo Soberano. Não há limites para o que posso fazer,\\" ele respondeu, a voz ecoando com uma autoridade sobrenatural. \\"Então, o Supremo Soberano vai me ajudar a voltar para o acampamento?\\" Arya retrucou, a dor começando a fazer sua paciência se esvair. \\"Hmm... depende. Vai me obrigar a pedir desculpas para aquele humano novamente?\\" Malakai perguntou, erguendo uma sobrancelha peluda. Arya bufou, a dor em seu tornozelo tornando-a menos tolerante com as brincadeiras de Malakai. \\"Esqueça as desculpas, apenas me ajude a levantar,\\" ela resmungou. O enorme lobo branco então se aproximou e, com um cuidado que contradizia seu tamanho e natureza selvagem, abaixou-se ao lado de Arya. \\"Suba nas minhas costas,\\" ele instruiu, mantendo-se agachado para que ela pudesse alcançar. Com um suspiro de resignação misturado com alívio, Arya usou o que restava de sua força para se posicionar nas costas do lobo. Malakai então se levantou lentamente, garantindo que Arya estivesse segura antes de começar a caminhar de volta ao acampamento. A caminhada de volta ao acampamento foi silenciosa, apenas o som dos passos do lobo gigante na neve quebrando o silêncio da noite. Arya, segurando-se firmemente na densa pelagem branca, sentia cada movimento do corpo poderoso e ágil de Malakai sob ela, uma mistura reconfortante de força e controle. A lua iluminava o caminho de volta, lançando um brilho prateado sobre a floresta, transformando o mundo à sua volta em uma paisagem de sombras e luz. “Vou correr um pouquinho…” Malakai acelerou, seus músculos ondulando poderosamente sob Arya enquanto ele se lançava pela floresta com uma velocidade surpreendente. Os ramos passavam por eles em um borrão, e Arya se agarrava à pelagem do lobo, o ar frio cortando seu rosto enquanto eles avançavam pela noite. “Kailus!” A velocidade com que se moviam era vertiginosa, e Arya mal conseguia manter os olhos abertos contra o vento gelado que batia contra seu rosto. Entre o cansaço e a adrenalina que corria por suas veias, ela sentia a dor em seu tornozelo diminuir, tornando-se uma mera memória distante enquanto confiava completamente em Malakai para levá-la em segurança. Finalmente, o lobo gigante desacelerou, aproximando-se do acampamento com uma elegância que desafiava seu tamanho. A fogueira, reduzida agora a brasas cintilantes, projetava uma luz suave e reconfortante. Malakai se abaixou mais uma vez, permitindo que Arya deslizasse para o chão com cuidado, apoiando-se em uma árvore próxima para não colocar peso sobre o tornozelo lesionado.","completion":"Erik e Lyanna, ao verem Arya retornar montada em um lobo branco gigante, ficaram boquiabertos, suas expressões misturando choque, admiração e um vislumbre de medo. A cena parecia ter sido arrancada das páginas de uma antiga lenda, trazendo à vida um ser que eles só conheciam por meio de mitos e sussurros na escuridão da noite. “Malakai?” Lyanna arriscou perguntar, sua voz tremendo levemente enquanto olhava para o lobo gigante agora parado perante eles. A transformação diante de seus olhos era algo que desafiava a compreensão, uma prova do poder inimaginável do Supremo Soberano. Malakai, ainda na forma de lobo, apenas confirmou com um aceno da cabeça, sua atenção voltada para Arya. Ela, depois de reaver o equilíbrio, lançou um olhar cansado, mas agradecido, na direção de Malakai, antes de se dirigir a Erik e Lyanna. \\"Estou bem, graças a Malakai,\\" Arya começou, vendo a preocupação que se formava nos rostos de seus companheiros de viagem. \\"Eu torci o tornozelo, mas ele me ajudou a voltar. Precisaremos descansar um pouco mais antes de seguir viagem.\\" O silêncio que se seguiu foi de compreensão, cada um deles meditando sobre os acontecimentos recentes e sobre o único ser que trazia tanto medo quanto fascínio. Malakai, sentindo que sua forma de lobo poderia estar causando desconforto, suavemente deixou que a magia se desfizesse, retransformando-se na figura imponente e conhecida, ainda que a presença dele permanecesse igualmente impactante. “Nós devemos... agradecer a você, Supremo Soberano,” Erik conseguiu dizer, sua voz forte em meio à incerteza que o cercava. “Sua ajuda... não será esquecida.” Lyanna acenou em concordância, encontrando coragem para se aproximar de Arya e verificar seu tornozelo machucado, enquanto lançava olhares curiosos e cautelosos na direção de Malakai. Malakai olhou para cada um deles, a luz das brasas refletindo em seus olhos escarlate. “Nada de agradecimentos. Fiz o que foi necessário. Mas lembrem-se, não é sábio depender sempre dos caprichos de um ser como eu,” ele disse, um sorriso enigmático e sutilmente ameaçador emoldurando suas palavras. Erick e Lyanna, cientes da verdade por trás das palavras de Malakai, acenaram em compreensão, sua admiração misturada com um respeito recém-descoberto, acomplexidade das emoções envolvidas demasiado grande para ser completamente compreendida ou articulada. Eles se acomodaram pelo resto da noite, cada um perdido em seus pensamentos e na estranha serenidade que agora envolvia o acampamento, apesar do conhecimento de que a estrada à frente ainda guardava inúmeros desafios. Arya, por fim, permitiu-se um momento de repouso, sua confiança em Malakai um estranho consolo diante das incertezas que povoavam a noite. E assim, o grupo, unido por circunstâncias inimagináveis e laços improbáveis, preparava-se para enfrentar o que viesse, cientes de que a jornada ainda estava longe de terminar."},{"prompt":"List each Star Wars Rebels Hero and Villain and explain why they are a Hero and why they are a villain","completion":"Heroes: 1.

Classification of Crimes The earliest classification involved only felonies. These were the more serious offences, which were regarded as putting good order in jeopardy, and included 67 murder, rape, etc. The most serious offences of all, in that they were directed at the state itself, constituted treason. A wrong which was in \\"breach of the peace\\" but which fell short of a felony was normally categorized as a trespass: this explains why several torts today either actually are crimes as well, or are similar to crimes in their nature. From time to time, however, other offences were created to maintain order. These were often less serious, and were generally created by statute, and were known generally as misdemeanours. This distinction, between felonies and misdemeanours, was important, because a person convicted of a felony was liable to forfeiture of his property, and in some cases, to the loss of his life (neither of these measures applied to misdemeanours). Later on, forfeiture was abolished, and the death penalty removed for felonies other than murder: the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours persisted, however, for some time.","completion":"Classification of Crimes جرایم چگونه طبقه‌بندی شده‌اند The earliest classification involved only felonies.

Сегодня я хочу поговорить о великом и значимом периоде в западно-европейской литературе, который состоялся в 15 веке. Введение нашей беседы начнется с определения этого времени как периода возрождения, когда литература стала одним из ведущих инструментов развития культуры и искусства. Литературные произведения той эпохи не просто отражали действительность, но и активно влияли на общественные устои, идентичность, философию и этику. Перейдем ко второму пункту нашего плана, который посвящен выдающимся западно-европейским авторам 15 века. В Италии такими авторами были Данте Алигьери с его \\"Божественной комедией\\", Петрарка с лирическими сонетами, которые положили начало развитию европейской литературы, и Джованни Боккаччо с \\"Декамероном\\", определившим новые направления в рассказе и комедии. Во Франции и Германии, результаты творчества таких авторов, как Жан Френсуа с \\"Романом о розе\\", Кристофоро Ленци, который прославился своими пасторалями и комедиями, также оставили неизгладимый след в истории литературы. Произведения и темы западно-европейской литературы 15 века богаты и многообразны. В религиозной литературе мы наблюдаем использование библейских мотивов и символики, описание святых и жизнеутверждающих сил. Касательно философии и моральной литературы, обсуждение нравственности, справедливости, мыслей о смысле жизни и роли человека в мире было центральным. Лирика, эпос и драма также активно развивались, выявляя человеческие эмоции, героические подвиги и начала современного театра. Основные тенденции 15 века – это развитие гуманизма, которое предопределило лицо всей западной цивилизации, разнообразие жанров и тем, что обогатило литературное пространство, а также актуализация человеческих ценностей и достоинства. Нельзя не отметить влияние этих литературных произведений на культуру и общество своего времени, они способствовали формированию современной идентичности и самосознания. В заключении хочется сказать, что 15 век играет решающую роль в развитии западно-европейской литературы. Произведения того времени не только повлияли на последующие эпохи и литературные течения, но и продолжают оставаться важной частью мирового культурного наследия.

Throughput is always lower than goodput, which is generally lower than bandwidth.","completion":"The correct relationship among goodput, throughput, and bandwidth in the context of network data transmissions is: **Goodput is always lower than throughput, which is generally lower than bandwidth.** Here's a more detailed explanation: - **Bandwidth** is the maximum rate at which data can be transferred over a network path or connection in a given amount of time, typically measured in bits per second (bps). It represents the capacity of the connection but not necessarily the actual data transfer rate achieved during communication. - **Throughput** is the actual rate at which data is successfully transferred over a network connection, taking into account all types of overhead, including protocol overhead and retransmissions due to errors. Throughput is influenced by many factors, such as the network's bandwidth, the quality of the connection, congestion on the network, and the capacity of the endpoints. Throughput is generally lower than the nominal bandwidth due to these overheads and inefficiencies in data transfer. - **Goodput** is the measure of useful data transferred over a network, excluding all the protocol overhead, retransmissions, and any other non-payload data. Goodput focuses on the actual application-level data rate, which is what the end-user is most concerned with (e.g., the rate at which a file is transferred excluding all overhead). Since goodput does not include packet overhead and other non-payload bits, it is always lower than throughput. Therefore, in practice, the bandwidth sets the upper limit for the data transfer rate, throughput is what is actually achieved with consideration of various overheads and inefficiencies, and goodput is the portion of the throughput that consists of actual user data without protocol overhead."},{"prompt":"Which physical layer network standard would use 8B/10B encoding? 1000BASE-T IEEE 802.11n IEEE 802.15 TIA/EIA-568","completion":"The physical layer network standard that uses 8B/10B encoding is: **1000BASE-T** 1000BASE-T is a Gigabit Ethernet standard over copper wiring.

This determination is important because it affects how the packet will be sent. If the destination is on the same network, the host may proceed to use Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) mechanisms, like sending a Neighbor Solicitation message directly.

These RA messages are sent by routers and contain their link-local addresses, which clients configure as their default gateway. 2. **IPv6 addressing is dynamically assigned to clients through the use of ICMPv6.** SLAAC relies on ICMPv6, specifically on Router Solicitation (RS) and Router Advertisement (RA) messages for address configuration. A client uses information in RA messages to automatically configure its own IPv6 address. Corrections to the misconceptions in the options: - SLAAC is not a stateful method; it is considered stateless because it does not require DHCPv6 servers to assign IPv6 addresses. However, DHCPv6 can be used in combination with SLAAC to provide additional network configuration information or used alone for stateful address configuration. - Router solicitation messages are actually sent by clients (not routers) to request IPv6 addressing information.

Additionally, if the initial problem description implies only domain name pings are successful but did not account for direct IP access methods (suggesting DNS resolution works to some extent), one might also consider: **firewall settings** This is relevant if the firewall is blocking HTTP or HTTPS traffic specifically, while allowing ICMP packets (used by ping). It's possible for network policies or firewall rules to allow ping responses (ICMP) but block web traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and/or port 443 (HTTPS), which would prevent web page access while still allowing the server to respond to pings.

Tracert uses IP addresses; ping does not. Ping shows whether the transmission is successful; tracert does not. Both ping and tracert can show results in a graphical display. Tracert shows each hop, while ping shows a destination reply only.","completion":"The statement that best describes the ping and tracert (traceroute on UNIX/Linux systems) commands is: **Tracert shows each hop, while ping shows a destination reply only.** Explanation: - **Ping** is used to determine the reachability of a destination on a network (can be an IP address or a domain name). When you ping a destination, it sends ICMP Echo Request messages and waits for Echo Reply messages to determine if the destination is reachable and to measure round-trip time. - **Tracert (traceroute)** is used to display the route (path) and measure transit delays of packets across a network. It identifies each router or hop along the path to a destination. Tracert sends out a series of packets with incrementally increasing Time-To-Live (TTL) values. For each hop along the path to the destination, tracert receives a \\"time exceeded\\" message from the routers it passes through, thus building a list of the route taken."},{"prompt":"What is a description of the default gateway address?​ It is the IP address of the ISP network device located in the cloud.

This, however, limits its distance because of modal dispersion. It's commonly used in LAN environments and shorter distances. - **Single-Mode Fiber** has a much smaller core size allowing only a single path (mode) of light, usually sourced from a laser, to propagate. This enables it to carry signals over much longer distances with less signal loss, making it ideal for use in campus backbones, metropolitan area networks (MANs), and long-haul networking."},{"prompt":"A user can access a file share resource on a server located in the same office but cannot access the internet.

The three functional areas addressed by physical layer standards include: 1. **Signaling** - This involves the physical transmission of data over a network media, including how signals represent binary 1s and 0s, and how the signals are sent and received by devices. 2. **Encoding** - This refers to the way data is converted into signals for transmission across the media. Encoding methods can influence factors such as bandwidth usage and error detection. 3. **Physical Components** - This covers all the hardware and media types used in transmitting and receiving data, including cables (copper, fiber), connectors, and other network interface hardware (for example, the physical aspects of network interface cards, and switches). Other options like frame encapsulation, media access control, and error detection and retransmission are not directly addressed by the physical layer standards. Frame encapsulation occurs at the data link layer (Layer 2), media access control is part of the data link layer's function (specifically, it's a subset of functionality within Layer 2), and error detection and retransmission strategies are typically implemented at higher layers of the OSI model, such as the transport layer (Layer 4) for retransmission."},{"prompt":"Which command can be used on a Windows host to display the routing table? tracert netstat –r netstat –s show ip route","completion":"On a Windows host, to display the routing table, the command you can use is: **netstat –r** This command lists the interface list, active routes, and the persistent routes (if any) configured on the Windows computer.

Among these, two key services are: 1. **Router Discovery** - NDP allows IPv6 hosts to discover routers that are willing to forward IPv6 packets on their behalf. Through router discovery, hosts can determine routers' presence and obtain critical information provided in Router Advertisements (RAs), such as network prefixes, MTU sizes, and the address of the default gateway. 2. **Address Resolution** - Similar to the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) in IPv4, NDP utilizes Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement messages to resolve the link-layer (MAC) address associated with a known IPv6 address on the same local link. This process is essential for enabling direct layer 2 communication between devices on a local network. The options \\"maximum IPv6 packet size for end-to-end transmission\\" and \\"domain name resolving\\" do not directly describe services provided by NDP. While NDP does facilitate the advertisement of the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size by routers, this is more accurately described as part of the router discovery service rather than a distinct service.

For example, a Router Solicitation message is sent by a host to request routers on the local link to immediately identify themselves by sending a Router Advertisement message. Similarly, a Neighbor Solicitation message is sent by a host to query the link-layer address of another host on the same local link. 2. **Advertisement Message**: This is sent in response to a solicitation message, providing the requested information. For example, a router responds to a Router Solicitation with a Router Advertisement message, informing the requesting host about its existence and other network parameters. Similarly, a host responds to a Neighbor Solicitation with a Neighbor Advertisement, providing its link-layer address.

Given the MAC address 1C-6F-65-C2-BD-F8, here's how you would generate the interface ID: 1. Split the MAC: \`1C 6F\` and \`C2 BD F8\` 2. Insert \\"FFFE\\": \`1C 6F:FFFE:C2 BD F8\` 3. Invert the 7th bit of the first byte: The first byte is \`1C\` in hexadecimal, which is \`00011100\` in binary. Inverting the 7th bit results in \`00011000\`, which translates back to \`18\` in hexadecimal. Putting it all together, the IPv6 interface ID in the EUI-64 format is: \`18-6F-FF-FE-C2-BD-F8\`. When formatted for an IPv6 address, it becomes: \`186F:FFFE:C2BD:F8\`. However, it seems there's a typo in the conversion to binary and inverting the bit — let's correct and clarify the process: The MAC address is 1C-6F-65-C2-BD-F8. 1. Split and insert: 1C-6F-FF-FE-C2-BD-F8 2. The 7th bit flipping involves the 1C's 7th bit. 1C in binary is 0001 1100. Flipping the 7th bit (from the left, so the second least significant bit from our perspective) changes 0001 1100 to 0010 1100, which is 2C (not 18). So, the correct steps lead us to: - Inserting \`FFFE\`: 1C-6F + FFFE + C2-BD-F8 - Flipping the 7th bit of 1C gives us 2C (not 18) The correct Interface ID would be: 2C6F:65FF:FEC2:BDF8 In the provided choices, the correct flipping process should result in \`2C6F:65FF:FEC2:BDF8\`, but since this precise option is not provided and acknowledging a step missing in the question's rendering: - The closest correct conversion following EUI-64 rules would be \`2C6F:65FF:FEC2:BDF8\`. - Considering provided options and common misunderstanding in manual conversions, the likely intended answer would resemble a pattern starting with the original MAC adjusted for EUI-64, however, a misunderstanding in binary-bit flipping led to missing the accurate final format from available choices.

The first octet in binary is \`00011100\`. Inverting the 7th bit, we get \`00011110\`, which in hexadecimal is \`1E\`. Thus, after inserting FFFE and modifying the U/L bit, we get: **1E-6F-FF-FE-C2-BD-F8**. When converting this to the IPv6 interface ID format, we add colons every 16 bits (4 hexadecimal characters), resulting in: **1E6F:FFFE:C2BD:F8**, and we typically represent hexadecimal characters in IPv6 addresses in lowercase, so it becomes **1e6f:fffe:c2bd:f8**.

This allows for fast read/write access to the configuration as the device operates. 2. **The contents of RAM are lost during a power cycle.** - RAM is volatile memory, which means its contents are lost when the device is powered off or restarted. This is a fundamental characteristic of RAM across computing devices, not just Cisco devices. Correcting the other options: - **RAM is a component in Cisco switches but not in Cisco routers.** This statement is incorrect. RAM is a key component in both Cisco switches and routers (as well as in most other computing and networking devices) and plays a critical role in their operation. - **RAM provides nonvolatile storage.** This statement is incorrect. RAM provides volatile storage, not nonvolatile. Nonvolatile storage retains its contents when power is turned off, which is not the case for RAM. Nonvolatile storage examples in Cisco devices include NVRAM (Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory) and flash memory. - **RAM is able to store multiple versions of IOS and configuration files.** This statement is generally incorrect. While RAM is used to store the running (active) configuration and the IOS image that the device is currently using, it does not typically store multiple versions of IOS and configurations due to its volatile nature and space limitations.

Networking configurations that isolate devices from each other could prevent proper discovery and communication. # 3. Test with a Known Device MAC Address As a diagnostic step, modify your script to target a specific bulb using its MAC address directly (if known), bypassing the automatic discovery process. This can help determine if the issue lies with device discovery or further down the communication process. # 4. Review \`lifxlan\` Usage Ensure your usage of \`lifxlan\` aligns with the examples provided in the library's documentation or GitHub repository. Sometimes, slight deviations in how functions are called can lead to unexpected behavior. # 5. Update Your Python Version or Environment While it's less likely the root cause, ensuring your Python environment is up to date and free of conflicting packages or versions can sometimes resolve mysterious issues. # 6. Check for Open Issues or Updates Look at the [lifxlan GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/mclarkk/lifxlan/issues) to see if anyone else has reported similar issues, or if there have been recent updates or patches that address this problem. # 7. Debugging and Further Investigation If the above steps don't resolve the issue, you may need to delve deeper into the lifxlan code or increase the logging verbosity to understand why the MAC address is not being correctly handled. In some instances, reviewing the source code or adding print statements for debugging purposes can illuminate where the breakdown occurs.

Instead, these errors come from the code trying to execute operations that involve communicating with devices that aren't present or discoverable. The specific error you've shared points to an underlying issue in how the \`lifxlan\` library constructs messages intended for the LIFX bulbs. It seems to be related to a problem with handling the MAC address of a device, which is a key part of the message-sending process in the network communication protocol. The error: \`\`\`plaintext bitstring.exceptions.CreationError: Token with length 64 packed with value of length 0. \`\`\` indicates that the script attempted to generate a network message with a device's MAC address, but the MAC address was not provided or discovered correctly, resulting in a zero-length value where a 64-bit (8 bytes) value was expected. # Understanding the Context 1. **Discovery Process**: The \`lifxlan\` library starts with a discovery process to find LIFX devices on the LAN. This process usually involves sending broadcast messages and waiting for responses from LIFX bulbs. 2. **Device Operations**: Once devices are discovered, their details (including MAC addresses) are used for subsequent operations—like getting or setting the state of the bulbs. # Reasons Why No Bulbs Were Discovered - **No Bulbs Present**: As you've mentioned you don't have any bulbs at the moment, the discovery process fails to find any devices, leading to operations that require device details to fail. - **Network Issues**: If there were devices, but they were unreachable due to network segmentation, strict firewall rules, or bulbs being in a different subnet, discovery would also fail. # Addressing the Problem - **With Bulbs Available**: The script should work as expected when LIFX bulbs are present on the network, properly configured, and accessible from your computer. - **Without Bulbs**: If you're experimenting with the library or developing applications without access to physical bulbs, you might consider modifying the scripts to bypass or mock the device communication aspects, focusing instead on the logic that doesn't require actual device responses. # Conclusion The errors are less about the absence of the bulbs and more about how the situation is handled code-wise. For testing and development purposes without bulbs, consider adjusting the script or your approach to accommodate or simulate the presence of bulbs.

Кроме того, задолго до организованного и профинансированного американцами государственного переворота в Киеве, в Пентагоне было решено, что Украина станет полноправным членом Североатлантического альянса для того, чтобы среди прочего получить полный контроль над природными ресурсами Украины, утверждает читатель газеты Nya Dagbladet Йозеф Чиба. Вашингтон и НАТО спровоцировали Россию, что привело к событиям февраля 2022 года, которыми Москва показала, что война против неё на Украине была проиграна задолго до того, как она началась. Несмотря на это, конфликт будет продолжаться ещё долго, поскольку американский ВПК зарабатывает миллиарды долларов, продавая оружие Украине на деньги европейских налогоплательщиков. Из расследования Сеймура Хёрша мир узнал, что именно США и НАТО взорвали газопровод в Балтийском море, чтобы заставить Германию и ЕС покупать природный газ у США, а не у России. Официальное расследование инцидента, естественно, закрыто, потому что никто не посмеет обвинить США и НАТО в совершении террористических актов. Помимо этого, в ходе интервью Такеру Карлсону Владимир Путин чётко заявил, что Россия не намерена нападать на какую-либо страну НАТО, однако государственные СМИ Запада не заинтересованы в том, чтобы предать огласке слова президента России. Многие проблемы Европы, включая кризис на Украине, можно было бы решить одной простой мерой — роспуском всего НАТО и заключением мира с Россией. Конечно, это решение не может быть реализовано, поскольку оно противоречит собственным интересам США, и до тех пор, пока США будут иметь возможность осуществлять безграничную власть над НАТО и влияние на него, военный блок будет продолжать своё существование и вооружённый конфликт на Украине будет продолжаться.","completion":"Понимаете, в этом мире юмора мало, а вот военных альянсов – предостаточно. И вот смотрите, НАТО сегодня - это словно огромная палка в руках Вашингтона. Нужно что-то защитить, потребовать, а то и просто показать мускулы - тут как тут. А случай с Украиной и вовсе как из анекдота: сначала все под раздачу критике, а потом \\"Опаньки! Членство в НАТО на горизонте!\\" А что до России, так тут не без иронии судьбы. Знаете, вызвали, вызвали Россию на дуэль, а она, похоже, решила, что лучше поздно, чем никогда и ответила. И тут весь замысел с обороной товарищами по НАТО как мираж рассеялся. А теперь о любимом деле Америки – продаже оружия. Этим можно писать комедии, если бы не было так грустно. Европа платит, а Вашингтон в карман кладет. И все это на фоне кризиса, который, кажется, можно решить так просто: распустить НАТО, пожать руку России, но нет, жанр трагикомедии в политике поддерживается на плаву за счет интересов не всей Европы, а кого-то конкретного за океаном. И вот, когда США с НАТО решили превратить Балтийское море в шоу фокусников с подрывом газопровода, мир как бы подмигнул: \\"А, ну да, кто бы сомневался!\\". Ведь кто еще осмелится указать на великого мага, устроившего все это безобразие? Так вот, господа, мир политики - это бесконечное шоу с элементами трагикомедии, где каждый номер лучше предыдущего.

However, I can help guide you on how to create one or suggest where you might find such images. If you're looking to create this image yourself, here are a few steps you might consider assuming you're using a digital art software: 1. **Sketch**: Start with a rough sketch of the person sitting or standing, with a bowl or a bunch of chili peppers in their hand. Make sure to position the hand and the chili pepper close to or inside the person's mouth, depending on whether you're depicting the moment before eating or while eating. 2. **Outline**: Once you're happy with the sketch, create a new layer (if digital) or carefully go over your sketch with a fine liner to make the outline clean and clear. 3. **Color**: Fill in the base colors for the person (skin, hair, clothes) and the chili peppers (typically red, but you can choose green or yellow for variety). Remember to add the color under the outline layer if you're working digitally. 4. **Shading and Highlighting**: Add shadows and highlights to give the image depth. Consider the light source direction. Chili peppers have a shiny surface, so don’t forget to add a little highlight to them. 5. **Background**: Depending on your preference, you can add a simple background like a kitchen or a dining room to set the scene or leave it with a plain colored background to keep the focus on the person and the chili peppers. 6. **Details and Expression**: Finally, adding details like tears, sweat, or steam emanating from the person's mouth can convey the heat of the chilies. Adjust the facial expression to reflect discomfort, enjoyment, or challenge. For those who prefer finding existing images, stock photo websites like Shutterstock, iStock, or Adobe Stock often have a wide range of images related to food and people eating.

Voici plusieurs façons de le faire : 1. **Développement de produits ou services IA** : Créer des applications, des outils ou des plateformes qui utilisent l'IA pour résoudre des problèmes spécifiques ou pour améliorer des processus dans divers secteurs, comme la santé, la finance, l'éducation, et le marketing. 2. **Consulting en IA** : Si vous avez une expertise approfondie en IA, vous pouvez offrir des services de consultant à des entreprises souhaitant implementer des solutions d'IA mais qui ne disposent pas des compétences en interne. 3. **Formation et éducation** : Avec l'intérêt croissant pour l'IA, il y a une forte demande pour l'éducation et la formation dans ce domaine. Vous pouvez créer des cours en ligne, des ateliers, ou des livres sur l'IA. 4. **Vente de données** : L'IA nécessite de grandes quantités de données pour l'apprentissage. Si vous avez accès à des datasets uniques et précieux, vous pourriez les vendre à des entreprises ou des chercheurs. 5. **Trading algorithmique** : Utiliser l'IA pour développer des algorithmes de trading peut être très rentable, mais cela nécessite une connaissance approfondie du marché financier ainsi que des compétences en programmation et en analyse de données. 6. **IA en tant que service (IAaaS)** : Mettre à disposition des capacités d'IA via le cloud permet aux entreprises de bénéficier de solutions d'IA sans devoir investir dans des infrastructures coûteuses. 7. **Startups IA** : Lancer une startup autour d'une solution d'IA innovante peut être très lucratif, surtout si la solution répond à un besoin de marché fort et peut attirer l'intérêt des investisseurs. 8. **Création de contenu généré par l'IA** : Utiliser l'IA pour créer du contenu (articles, vidéos, images, musique) peut être une manière de produire rapidement des contenus à grande échelle pour différentes plateformes. 9. **Publicité et marketing personnalisés** : L'IA peut aider à personnaliser les campagnes publicitaires et les stratégies marketing pour augmenter leur efficacité, en analysant des données sur les clients de manière à cibler très précisément les messages. N'oubliez pas que réussir dans l'un de ces domaines exige non seulement une compréhension de l'IA et de ses applications, mais aussi une solide expertise en gestion d'entreprise, en marketing, en ventes, et souvent en droit (notamment pour les questions de protection des données et de propriété intellectuelle)."},{"prompt":"existe t'il des app ia pour le trading ?","completion":"Oui, il existe plusieurs applications et plateformes qui utilisent l'intelligence artificielle (IA) pour le trading. Ces solutions emploient l'analyse de données, l'apprentissage automatique et d'autres technologies d'IA pour aider les traders à prendre des décisions plus éclairées, à gérer les risques et parfois même à exécuter des ordres automatiquement. Voici quelques exemples de types d'applications disponibles : 1. **Robo-advisors** : Ces plateformes fournissent des conseils financiers ou la gestion de portefeuille avec peu ou pas d'intervention humaine, en utilisant des algorithmes pour allouer, gérer et optimiser les actifs des clients. 2. **Plateformes de trading algorithmique** : Elles permettent aux traders de coder ou d'utiliser des stratégies de trading préexistantes qui s'exécutent automatiquement en fonction des conditions du marché, grâce à des signaux générés par l'IA. 3. **Analyse de marché et prévisions** : Certaines applications se spécialisent dans l'analyse des tendances du marché, la surveillance des actualités financières, et la prédiction des mouvements de marché à l'aide d'algorithmes d'IA. 4. **Plateformes de trading social** : Bien que pas exclusivement basées sur l'IA, certaines de ces plateformes utilisent des éléments d'IA pour analyser les performances des traders, permettant ainsi aux utilisateurs de copier automatiquement les stratégies des traders les plus performants. 5. **Outils d'optimisation de portefeuille** : Ces outils utilisent souvent l'IA pour aider à diversifier et à ajuster les portefeuilles d'investissement afin de maximiser le rendement ajusté au risque. Voici quelques exemples spécifiques d'applications et de plateformes : - **Robinhood** : Bien qu'étant essentiellement une application de trading pour tous, elle utilise des algorithmes pour offrir des recommandations personnalisées à ses utilisateurs. - **Betterment** et **Wealthfront** : Deux exemples populaires de robo-advisors qui utilisent l'IA pour gérer les investissements de façon automatisée. - **QuantConnect** et **MetaTrader 4/5 (avec Expert Advisors)** : Plateformes utilisées pour le trading algorithmique, où les utilisateurs peuvent coder leurs propres stratégies ou utiliser celles créées par la communauté.

La gestión de costos es una parte crítica en la administración de cualquier proyecto, ya que permite asegurar que el proyecto se complete dentro del presupuesto aprobado. Esto incluye procesos como la estimación, el presupuesto y el control de costos. Aquí hay algunas consideraciones clave acerca de la gestión de costos en proyectos de tecnología de la información: 1. **Planificación de Costos**: Esto implica definir las políticas, procedimientos y documentación para planificar, gestionar, y controlar los costos del proyecto. Es fundamental desarrollar un plan de gestión de costos detallado que guíe cómo se estimarán, presupuestarán y controlarán los costos. 2. **Estimación de Costos**: Se refiere a desarrollar una aproximación de los recursos monetarios necesarios para completar las actividades del proyecto. Esto puede hacerse usando herramientas y técnicas como la estimación basada en la experiencia (análoga), paramétrica, y la estimación bottom-up, entre otras. 3. **Determinación del Presupuesto**: Una vez estimados los costos, se debe consolidar esos costos estimados para establecer una línea base de costos autorizada que servirá para medir el rendimiento del proyecto. Este presupuesto incluirá todos los fondos autorizados para realizar el proyecto. 4. **Control de Costos**: Este proceso implica influir en los factores que crean cambios en la línea base de costos y gestionar los cambios cuando ocurren. Requiere de la medición del desempeño real del proyecto contra el presupuesto planificado y la implementación de cambios cuando sea necesario para prevenir o corregir desvíos, ajustando objetivos o altorizando cambios en el presupuesto. Cada uno de estos procesos es crucial para asegurar que un proyecto no exceda el presupuesto acordado y para garantizar la viabilidad financiera del proyecto. Es importante destacar que, en tecnología de la información, los costos pueden variar significativamente dependiendo de la naturaleza del proyecto, tecnología implicada, recursos humanos necesarios, infraestructura, entre otros factores. Además, dada la rápida evolución de las tecnologías, la gestión de costos debe ser flexible y adaptativa para acomodar los cambios que puedan surgir durante la vida del proyecto. ¿Tienes alguna pregunta específica relacionada con la gestión de los costos del proyecto en el contexto de tecnología de la información que te gustaría discutir?"},{"prompt":"• Realizar un ejemplo de Matriz RAM en un pryecto de realizar una app web de venta para un spermercado - la matriz tiene culumnas: actividad - y columnas con nombres(tu decide cuantas).

El Product Owner es responsable de comprender las necesidades, prioridades y feedback del cliente para incorporarlos en la pila de producto (Product Backlog) y asegurar que el equipo de desarrollo trabaje en las características que aporten el mayor valor al negocio y, por lo tanto, al cliente. Sin embargo, si se trata de mencionar a una persona o entidad específica fuera del equipo de desarrollo de Scrum que representa al cliente o al usuario final del producto de software, habría que designar un nombre ficticio o una entidad para este propósito. En este contexto, el cliente puede ser un personaje o entidad hipotética que espera beneficiarse del software desarrollado. Por ejemplo: **Cliente:** Compañía \\"Supermercados XYZ\\" representada por **Laura Castillo** (Gerente de Operaciones) En esta situación, Laura Castillo y la compañía \\"Supermercados XYZ\\" serían quienes buscan contratar o han contratado al equipo de Scrum para el desarrollo del software, y por lo tanto, se beneficiarán directamente del producto final.

Alex Vargas (Scrum Master) y Daniela Méndez (Product Owner) participan para facilitar y asegurar que se comprenden las necesidades. Incluir a Beatriz Gómez (Analista de Datos) también tiene sentido si el análisis de requerimientos involucra comprensión de datos. 2. **Diseño de la Interfaz:** Daniela Méndez (Product Owner) proporciona visión del cliente y Carla Gómez (Desarrolladora Front-end) la implementa. 3. **Desarrollo Back-end:** Juan Pérez (Desarrollador Back-end, asumo) y Sergio Navarro (Especialista en Seguridad IT, asumo) es una combinación correcta si las tareas de back-end involucran aspectos de seguridad. 4. **Desarrollo Front-end:** Carla Gómez está bien asignada aquí. 5. **Integración y Pruebas:** Esta actividad suele involucrar a múltiples miembros del equipo, incluyendo desarrolladores y el Scrum Master, para facilitar el proceso. La presencia del Product Owner también es relevante para validar que las integraciones cumplen con los requisitos del negocio. Incluir a Sergio Navarro (Especialista en Seguridad IT) es adecuado si se realizan pruebas de seguridad durante la integración. 6. **Análisis de Datos:** Beatriz Gómez (Analista de Datos) es la asignación correcta. 7. **Implementación de Seguridad:** Sergio Navarro siendo el especialista en seguridad es el indicado. 8. **Despliegue y Monitoreo:** La participación de múltiples roles es adecuada dada la naturaleza transversal de esta tarea. 9. **Mantenimiento y Actualizaciones:** La colaboración de todos excepto Beatriz Gómez refleja la continuidad del proyecto y la necesidad de adaptación y corrección post lanzamiento. 10. **Comunicación y Gestión del Proyecto:** Es parte de las responsabilidades principales del Scrum Master y del Product Owner gestionar la comunicación dentro del equipo de proyecto y con los stakeholders. En resumen, las asignaciones en la Matriz RAM parecen en su mayoría correctas basadas en los roles de Scrum y la naturaleza de las tareas.

Sin embargo, según la metodología de Scrum y la colaboración inherente a los proyectos ágiles, podría sugerirse un ajuste para reflejar esta naturaleza colaborativa: 1. **Mantener a Alex Vargas (Scrum Master) y a Daniela Méndez (Product Owner)**: No haría cambios en estas asignaciones, dado que son roles centrales para la facilitación, comunicación y representación de los intereses del proyecto. El Scrum Master se asegura de que el equipo sigue los principios de Scrum, mientras que el Product Owner es fundamental en la comunicación con stakeholders y representación de sus intereses. 2. **Agregar Miembros del Equipo de Desarrollo en algunas instancias específicas**: Aunque el Scrum Master y el Product Owner son los principales encargados de la gestión y comunicación del proyecto, es fundamental reconocer el valor de involucrar activamente a los miembros del equipo de desarrollo en ciertas discusiones, especialmente aquellas que afectan directamente el trabajo del equipo o donde su feedback puede ser crucial. Esto puede ser en instancias específicas como revisiones de sprint, planificación y retrospectivas donde el equipo colabora para mejorar los procesos. Por lo tanto, no necesariamente se añadiría una \\"X\\" en la columna de todos los miembros del equipo de desarrollo para esta actividad, pero sí se destacaría la importancia de su participación activa en muchos aspectos de la comunicación y gestión del proyecto como parte de la dinámica ágil de trabajo en Scrum.

Su propósito es clarificar roles y responsabilidades en diferentes tareas y procesos dentro de un proyecto. Aunque la Matriz RAM/RACI es más comúnmente asociada con metodologías de gestión de proyectos tradicionales, nada impide que se utilice como un medio para aclarar roles y responsabilidades en un entorno ágil como Scrum, especialmente en entornos complejos o en equipos grandes donde la claridad en la asignación de tareas puede mejorar la eficiencia. En el contexto de **Scrum**, esta herramienta puede ser útil, pero se debe tener cuidado de no imponer rigideces que contradigan los principios de agilidad. Scrum se basa en la autoorganización del equipo, flexibilidad y colaboración estrecha, por lo cual, una Matriz RAM en un entorno Scrum debería usarse de manera que apoye y no limite estas características. Por ejemplo, puede ayudar a clarificar roles externos al equipo Scrum o responsabilidades concretas fuera del alcance habitual de Scrum pero que son necesarias para el éxito del proyecto. Sin embargo, dentro del equipo Scrum, la colaboración y la capacidad de adaptarse a las necesidades del proyecto son más importantes que seguir estrictamente asignaciones detalladas. Si **no fuera una metodología Scrum**, la aplicación de una Matriz RAM es completamente adecuada y altamente recomendada. En metodologías tradicionales de gestión de proyectos, esta matriz es una herramienta clave para definir claramente quién es responsable, quién debe ser consultado y quién necesita estar informado para cada tarea del proyecto. Esto facilita la comunicación y ayuda a prevenir confusiones y solapamientos de responsabilidades. La efectividad de la Matriz RAM, ya sea en ambientes ágiles como Scrum o en enfoques más tradicionales, dependerá de cómo se implemente y utilice. Debe ser flexible y adaptarse a las necesidades del equipo y del proyecto, sirviendo como una guía para la colaboración eficaz y no como una restricción a la autoorganización y dinámica del equipo."},{"prompt":"Actividades Alex Vargas Daniela Méndez Huan Paz Carla Gómez Beatriz Gómez Sergio Navarro Análisis de Requerimientos R Z Z Z Z Diseño de la Interfaz R, A Z R Z Z Desarrollo Back-end A R Z Z A Desarrollo Front-end A Z R Z A Integración y Pruebas R, A A R R Z R Análisis de Datos A Z Z R Z Implementación de Seguridad A Z Z Z R Despliegue y Monitoreo R, A A R R Z R Mantenimiento y Actualizaciones A R R Z A Comunicación y Gestión del Proyecto R, A R Z Z Z Z - revisa si este diagrama RAZI es correcto, yo veo que falta la I, responde correctamente en formato de tabla","completion":"Entiendo que quieres revisar y corregir la matriz que has presentado para incluir el código \\"I\\" (Informado) junto a las asignaciones de roles usando \\"R\\" (Responsable), \\"A\\" (Accountable, o responsable final), y \\"Z\\" que asumo querías representar \\"C\\" de Consulted.

Carla Gómez (Desarrolladora Front-end) siendo \\"R\\" está bien asignado, y los demás roles tienen asignaciones adecuadas basadas en sus áreas de influencia. 3. **Desarrollo Back-end/Desarrollo Front-end**: - Correcto. Los responsables (Juan Pérez para Back-end y Carla Gómez para Front-end) están bien identificados. El Especialista en Seguridad (Sergio Navarro) está consultado (C), lo cual es prudente para asegurar la seguridad del código desde el desarrollo. 4. **Integración y Pruebas**: - Este proceso generalmente implica a todos quienes están involucrados en el desarrollo (Juan Pérez y Carla Gómez). El Scrum Master (Alex Vargas) está marcado como \\"A\\", lo cual podría considerarse correcto desde una perspectiva de facilitación y apoyo, pero es más común que el \\"A\\" sea el Product Owner. Sergio Navarro está correctamente asignado como consultado aquí, asegurando que la seguridad sea parte de las pruebas. 5. **Análisis de Datos**: - Beatriz Gómez como \\"R\\" es correcto, siendo la Analista de Datos. Daniela Méndez (PO) como consultada y el resto siguiendo un patrón lógico según sus roles. 6. **Implementación de Seguridad**: - Sergio Navarro como \\"R\\" es apropiado. Es interesante notar que puede ser útil que el Product Owner (Daniela Méndez) esté informado, en lugar de solo otros siendo consultados o informados, para entender el impacto de la seguridad en los requisitos del producto. 7. **Despliegue y Monitoreo/Mantenimiento y Actualizaciones**: - La asignación parece adecuada, considerando que tanto el desarrollo como la supervisión de despliegue y mantenimiento son esenciales para todos los desarrolladores. La participación activa del Scrum Master (Alex Vargas) como responsable final en el monitoreo y despliegue puede no ser lo más típico, ya que usualmente se centra en facilitar más que en responsabilidades técnicas directas. 8. **Comunicación y Gestión del Proyecto**: - La inclusión de Daniela Méndez y Alex Vargas como \\"R,A\\" es correcta, reflejando la colaboración entre el Product Owner y el Scrum Master para la gestión y comunicación del proyecto. En general, la matriz es lógica y refleja bien las responsabilidades dentro de un equipo de desarrollo de software ágil. Sin embargo, las asignaciones específicas de \\"Accountable\\" (A) podrían reconsiderarse para asegurar que se alinean con las expectativas y responsabilidades de cada rol, especialmente en actividades técnicas donde el Product Owner tradicionalmente no sería el \\"Accountable.\\" Además, la práctica común es que el Product Owner sea el \\"Accountable\\" en la mayoría de las actividades relacionadas con el producto, reflejando su responsabilidad final sobre el producto entregado."},{"prompt":"que corrijo, solo muestrame las filas que debo correjir","completion":"Basándome en la discusión anterior y enfocándome en las filas que podrían requerir correcciones para alinearse mejor con las expectativas y responsabilidades de cada rol en un contexto de Scrum, aquí están las sugerencias de corrección: **Integración y Pruebas**: - Cambiar: Alex Vargas (SM) de \\"A\\" a \\"C\\" o \\"I\\" porque, aunque facilita y apoya, el accountability del producto recae en el Product Owner. **Implementación de Seguridad**: - Agregar: Daniela Méndez (PO) como \\"I\\" para asegurar que está informada sobre los aspectos de seguridad implementados, dado su impacto en el producto final. **Despliegue y Monitoreo**: - Cambiar: Alex Vargas (SM) de \\"A\\" a \\"I\\". El Product Owner (Daniela Méndez), como el principal responsable de definir el valor del producto, podría considerarse como \\"A\\" para asegurar que el despliegue y monitoreo cumplen con las necesidades del negocio. **Mantenimiento y Actualizaciones**: - Cambiar: Alex Vargas (SM) y Daniela Méndez (PO) podrían ser reconsiderados en cuanto a quién es \\"A\\". En un contexto de Scrum, sería más común que el Product Owner sea el \\"A\\" ya que tiene la visión completa del producto y decide sobre las prioridades.

La responsabilidad directa del mantenimiento y actualizaciones usualmente recae en el equipo de desarrollo, mientras que el Product Owner mantiene su rol de \\"A\\". Para todas las actividades, es crucial recordar que el Product Owner es generalmente quien tiene la última palabra (\\"A\\") en decisiones relativas al producto, mientras que el Scrum Master es un facilitador del proceso, y los miembros del equipo de desarrollo son los ejecutores (\\"R\\") de las tareas técnicas.

El Scrum Master generalmente facilita y asegura que el equipo tiene todo lo necesario para realizar su trabajo, incluidas las pruebas e integración, pero no está tan involucrado en la ejecución técnica como para ser consultado constantemente. **Mantenimiento y Actualizaciones**: - La asignación actual parece asumir adecuadamente las responsabilidades en base a la explicación previa y no requeriría cambios, especialmente si consideramos a Daniela Méndez (PO) como \\"A\\" y a Alex Vargas como \\"R\\". Sin embargo, es más común esperar que el equipo de desarrollo (\\"R\\") esté más involucrado en la ejecución directa de estas tareas, mientras que el Scrum Master facilita.

I was using SDL_mixer but then I ran into a dilemma, the sound effects provided by the library (Mix_Chunk) has only WAV support, the only part with MP3 and several other formats is Mix_Music. Would it be hard to implement it in SDL_mixer or should I look to other alternatives like SDL_Mixer_X library, which offers all these formats on the get go but I have to add a new library for it","completion":"Using SDL_mixer for an audio manager in your game engine is a common choice and offers a lot of functionality out of the box, including easy integration with SDL, which you're already using. The limitation you've encountered with \`Mix_Chunk\` supporting mainly WAV files for sound effects but not MP3s or other formats is due to the SDL_mixer library's design and the licensing and technical issues surrounding MP3 and various other audio formats. Implementing additional format support directly within SDL_mixer for \`Mix_Chunk\` may not be straightforward for several reasons: 1. **Licensing**: Different audio formats come with different licensing requirements. MP3, for example, had licensing and patent issues, although as of writing, its patents have expired. Still, adding support for new formats may require careful consideration of legal implications. 2. **Technical Challenges**: Decoding various audio formats to play them as sound effects involves integrating with or implementing different decoders. This can be complex and time-consuming. 3. **Maintainability**: Modifying a library like SDL_mixer directly means you'd have to maintain your version of the library, including merging in updates from the official version and ensuring your additional features remain compatible. Given these considerations, here are some options you could explore: 1. **Work with the Limitation**: Continue using SDL_mixer, using WAV files for sound effects (which is common in many games due to the simplicity and low overhead of uncompressed audio for short sounds) and MP3 or other formats for background music via \`Mix_Music\`. 2. **SDL_Mixer_X**: This is an extended version of SDL_mixer with additional features, including support for more audio formats for sound effects. While adding a new library might seem like extra work, SDL_Mixer_X is designed to be a drop-in replacement with additional functionality, which might make this transition smoother than expected. 3. **Use External Tools**: Convert your audio files to WAV format for sound effects and other supported formats for music. This can be a simple process using various available audio conversion tools or libraries. While this adds a step in your asset pipeline, it keeps your technology stack simple and leverages the familiar and well-documented SDL_mixer. 4. **Explore Other Audio Libraries**: If the above options do not meet your needs, consider other audio libraries that might offer more extensive format support or other features important to your game engine. Libraries such as FMOD, OpenAL, or even more comprehensive multimedia frameworks like GStreamer offer wide format support and advanced audio features but may introduce added complexity or licensing considerations. Integrating a new library like SDL_Mixer_X or exploring alternative audio libraries can introduce more dependencies and potential complexity but might provide the audio format support and features you need. Consider the trade-offs in terms of ease of use, compatibility with your existing codebase, and the long-term maintainability of your project."},{"prompt":"Is there a way to use SDL_audio to workout these limitations without adding SDL_Mixer_X?","completion":"Yes, you can work around these limitations using the lower-level SDL_audio API, though it will require more effort and coding on your part compared to using SDL_mixer or SDL_Mixer_X. SDL_audio provides the basic foundation for audio playback, upon which you can implement support for different audio formats and more sophisticated audio playback features. Here's how you can approach it: # 1. Decoding Audio Files To play audio formats beyond WAV with SDL_audio, you'll need to decode them to raw audio data manually. Libraries such as libvorbis for OGG, libmpg123 for MP3, or dr_flac for FLAC can be used for decoding different audio formats. Each of these libraries can convert audio files into uncompressed PCM format that SDL_audio can play. # 2. Implementing an Audio Playback System Once you have the raw audio data, you need to manually handle audio playback. This involves: - Initializing the SDL_audio subsystem. - Opening an audio device with \`SDL_OpenAudioDevice()\` specifying the desired audio format and callback function. - Implementing the callback function to feed audio data to SDL's audio buffer as needed. # 3. Managing Audio Data and Playback Managing multiple audio streams (for simultaneous sound effects and music, for example) becomes your responsibility. You'll need to mix audio streams in software if you want multiple sounds to play concurrently. This typically involves: - Keeping track of all the active audio sources and their states (playing, paused, stopped). - Mixing audio samples from multiple sources into a single stream buffer that you submit to SDL_audio for playback, taking care to not exceed the buffer's size and to adjust volumes appropriately. # Example Skeleton \`\`\`cpp void audio_callback(void* userdata, Uint8* stream, int len) { // Clear the stream SDL_memset(stream, 0, len); // Mix your audio sources here. \`userdata\` can be used to access your audio sources and mixer. } int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_AUDIO); SDL_AudioSpec want, have; SDL_memset(&want, 0, sizeof(want)); want.freq = 48000; // or another standard frequency want.format = AUDIO_F32; // or another format want.channels = 2; // stereo want.samples = 4096; // buffer size want.callback = audio_callback; // your callback SDL_AudioDeviceID dev = SDL_OpenAudioDevice(NULL, 0, &want, &have, 0); if (dev == 0) { // Handle error } else { SDL_PauseAudioDevice(dev, 0); // Start playing // Your game loop here SDL_PauseAudioDevice(dev, 1); // Stop playing } SDL_CloseAudioDevice(dev); SDL_Quit(); return 0; } \`\`\` # Final Considerations - **Performance**: Mixing audio in software can be CPU-intensive, especially for multiple streams or complex audio operations. Test the performance impact on your target hardware. - **Complexity**: This approach requires a good understanding of audio processing and can significantly increase the complexity of your code. - **External Libraries**: For decoding, you'll be handling additional dependencies yourself, similar to integrating another higher-level audio library, but with more manual work involved. In summary, while it's feasible to overcome SDL_mixer's format limitations using SDL_audio and external decoding libraries, evaluate whether the added complexity and effort align with your project's needs versus integrating a more feature-rich library like SDL_Mixer_X or alternatives."},{"prompt":"No I think I will just add SDL_Mixer_X library, even though I wanted to use SDL only, I don't like to limit the users to just use WAV when there are so many alternatives. Will be too much overhead to add this library in terms of memory contrains or similar?","completion":"Adding SDL_Mixer_X to your project is a decision that prioritizes flexibility and user convenience over the simplicity of sticking with SDL and SDL_mixer alone. It's a logical step, especially if you aim to support a broader range of audio formats without wanting to delve into the complexities of manual audio decoding and mixing. # Memory and Performance Overhead Regarding the concern about memory and performance overhead when integrating SDL_Mixer_X: 1. **Memory Usage**: SDL_Mixer_X, being an extension of SDL_mixer, is designed to be efficient. The increase in memory usage when using SDL_Mixer_X instead of SDL_mixer is typically minimal and primarily related to the additional functionalities and the variety of audio formats it supports. In the context of modern computing devices, this increase is usually negligible. However, if your project targets very low-spec hardware or platforms with stringent memory constraints, you'll want to profile your application to monitor its memory usage. 2. **Performance**: The performance impact should also be minimal under most circumstances. The playback of common audio formats, even those more complex than WAV, should not significantly burden modern processors. The efficiency of SDL_Mixer_X's internal processing means that for typical game audio needs (e.g., playing several sound effects simultaneously with background music), the CPU overhead will not be a concern for most projects. 3. **Library Size**: Adding SDL_Mixer_X will increase the size of your distribution compared to using SDL_mixer alone. This might be relevant if you are extremely limited in terms of distributable size (e.g., for web-based games or applications distributed over bandwidth-constrained networks). However, for the majority of desktop and mobile applications, the size difference should be manageable and outweighed by the benefits of enhanced audio format support. # Simplifying Development Using SDL_Mixer_X can simplify your development process in significant ways: - **Format Support**: Your game engine will be able to handle a variety of audio formats for both sound effects and music out of the box, making your engine more flexible and user-friendly. - **Audio Features**: You get access to additional functionalities that might be useful for game development, like grouping channels, applying effects, or more fine-grained control over playback, without implementing these features from scratch. # Integration Ease If you're already familiar with SDL_mixer, adopting SDL_Mixer_X should be relatively straightforward, as it's designed to be a drop-in replacement with additional features. The documentation and examples provided by SDL_Mixer_X can help bridge any gaps in understanding the new functionalities. # Conclusion In essence, the trade-off for integrating SDL_Mixer_X revolves around accepting a slight increase in memory usage and distribution size in exchange for a significant gain in audio capabilities and development convenience. For most modern game development scenarios, especially where diverse audio format support is desired, incorporating SDL_Mixer_X is a worthwhile consideration. Remember to test your application on your target platforms to ensure the integration meets your performance and resource usage expectations."},{"prompt":"perfect, help me add it to my codeblocks project, I don't know what to do since I never added any library and I just used SDL that was provided by the OS","completion":"Adding SDL_Mixer_X or any new library to a Code::Blocks project involves several steps, including downloading the library, linking it to your project, and including the appropriate headers in your source code. Here's a step-by-step guide tailored for adding SDL_Mixer_X, but the general process applies to most third-party libraries. # Step 1: Download SDL_Mixer_X First, you need to download SDL_Mixer_X. Go to the SDL_Mixer_X official website or its GitHub repository to download the latest version of the library. Make sure to download the version that matches your development environment (e.g., Windows, Linux, etc.). - SDL_Mixer_X GitHub: https://github.com/Wohlstand/SDL-Mixer-X # Step 2: Extract the Library Extract the downloaded files to a known location on your system. If you're on Windows, you might end up with folders like \`lib\`, \`include\`, and possibly \`bin\`. Ensure you know where these are, as you'll need to reference them soon. # Step 3: Add Include Directory to Your Project In Code::Blocks, open your project, then: 1. Go to \`Project\` → \`Build options...\`. 2. Make sure your project's name is highlighted in the left pane. 3. Go to the \`Search directories\` tab. 4. Under the \`Compiler\` tab within that, click \`Add\`. 5. Browse to the \`SDL_Mixer_X/include\` folder and select it. 6. Click \`OK\` to close the dialog. # Step 4: Add Library Directories Still in the \`Build options...\` dialog: 1. Under the \`Search directories\` tab, switch to the \`Linker\` tab. 2. Click \`Add\` and browse to the \`SDL_Mixer_X/lib\` folder, then click \`OK\`. 3. Close the dialog with \`OK\`. # Step 5: Link Against SDL_Mixer_X and Its Dependencies Now, you need to instruct Code::Blocks to link your project against SDL_Mixer_X and possibly SDL2 itself if SDL_Mixer_X doesn't automatically handle this. 1. In the \`Build options...\` dialog, switch to the \`Linker settings\` tab. 2. Use the \`Add\` button under the \`Link libraries:\` section to add the SDL_Mixer_X library. You might need to add \`-lSDL2_mixer_x\` or specify the exact library file name, depending on how the SDL_Mixer_X library is named and your platform. For Windows, it might be something like \`SDL2_mixer_x.lib\`. 3. If you need to link against SDL2 and any other dependencies, add them here in the same way (e.g., \`-lSDL2\`, \`-lSDL2main\` for SDL). 4. Click \`OK\` to close the dialog. # Step 6: Ensure SDL2 and SDL_Mixer_X DLLs are Available If you're on Windows, ensure that the relevant \`.dll\` files for SDL2 and SDL_Mixer_X are either in your project's working directory (the folder where your executable will be) or in a directory that's in your system's PATH environment variable. # Step 7: Include SDL_Mixer_X in Your Code Now, in your source files where you wish to use SDL_Mixer_X, make sure you include the necessary headers. For example: \`\`\`cpp #include \\"SDL_mixer_x.h\\" \`\`\` # Step 8: Test Your Setup Finally, write some test code to initialize SDL_Mixer_X, and attempt to build and run your project. If there are any linker errors, double-check the paths you added in Code::Blocks and the names of the libraries you're linking against. Note: This guide assumes a certain level of familiarity with SDL2 and Code::Blocks. Library paths, names, and specific steps may vary slightly depending on your development environment's specifics, SDL_Mixer_X's version, and whether you're using a custom build of SDL_Mixer_X or prebuilt binaries."},{"prompt":"Is there a way to install it on my OS too (opensuse)? I see the original SDL_mixer is installed here for example: /usr/lib64/libSDL2_mixer-2.0.so.0 /usr/lib64/libSDL2_mixer-2.0.so.0.800.0 /usr/share/doc/packages/libSDL2_mixer-2_0-0 /usr/share/doc/packages/libSDL2_mixer-2_0-0/CHANGES.txt /usr/share/doc/packages/libSDL2_mixer-2_0-0/README.txt /usr/share/licenses/libSDL2_mixer-2_0-0 /usr/share/licenses/libSDL2_mixer-2_0-0/LICENSE.txt","completion":"Installing SDL_Mixer_X on openSUSE, or any Linux distribution, if it's not available directly from the distribution's package repositories, generally involves building it from source. As of my last update, SDL_Mixer_X might not be readily available in the package repositories for openSUSE, which means you may need to compile it yourself. Here’s a general approach to building and installing a library from source on Linux: # Step 1: Install Dependencies Before compiling SDL_Mixer_X, you need to ensure that you have SDL2 and any other required libraries or development tools installed. For SDL_Mixer_X, this likely includes SDL2 development files at a minimum. You can install SDL2 development files and other build essentials using \`zypper\`, the package manager for openSUSE. Open a terminal and run: \`\`\`sh sudo zypper install libSDL2-devel gcc-c++ cmake make \`\`\` Note: The above command installs SDL2 development libraries, a C++ compiler, CMake, and GNU Make, which are common requirements for building software from source. SDL_Mixer_X might require additional dependencies based on its features and the formats it supports. # Step 2: Download SDL_Mixer_X Source Next, download the source code for SDL_Mixer_X. You can find the source on its GitHub repository. You might download it directly via a web browser or use git to clone the repository: \`\`\`sh git clone https://github.com/Wohlstand/SDL-Mixer-X.git \`\`\` Navigate to the directory where you downloaded or cloned the SDL_Mixer_X source. # Step 3: Compile SDL_Mixer_X With the dependencies installed and source code ready, you can now compile SDL_Mixer_X. The exact steps may vary depending on the project's setup, but generally, for projects using CMake, the process looks something like this: 1. Create a build directory and enter it: \`\`\`sh mkdir build && cd build \`\`\` 2. Configure the project: \`\`\`sh cmake .. \`\`\` Here, \`..\` refers to the parent directory where the source code resides. You might need to specify additional configuration options based on your preferences or system setup. 3. Build the project: \`\`\`sh make \`\`\` 4. Install the library: \`\`\`sh sudo make install \`\`\` This step typically copies the built library files into system-wide directories, like \`/usr/local/lib\`, and may additionally install headers in \`/usr/local/include\`. # Step 4: Update Library Cache After installing, it's a good practice to update the library cache on your system: \`\`\`sh sudo ldconfig \`\`\` # Step 5: Verify Installation Finally, you can verify that SDL_Mixer_X was successfully installed by checking the version or attempting to compile a small test program that links against it. # Note The steps provided here are somewhat generic because the specifics can vary based on a library’s build system and dependencies. Always refer to the README or INSTALL files in the source code you downloaded for specific build instructions. If SDL_Mixer_X has additional required dependencies not covered here, you'll need to install those as well."},{"prompt":"OK this is the snippet of the README that deals with the build, I don't understand several things: 1) It says that support several formats without installing anything but then it listen them that it uses other libraries, does this mean I have to install it? 2) Since I am making a C++ SDL based game engine, and I will probably use it in closed source projects too, should I just go with the default installation? 3) Why there is \\"..\\" in the Cmake command in the terminal? Does that means I have to add something else there? 4) Which one is better to be linked, statically or dynamically? I think dynamically will allow me to have more formats LGPL ones, even though I don't plan on using those. More file formats support Without installing any codec libraries and without AudioCodecs pack use, these formats will be supported by the library by default: WAV AIFF VOC (As Mix_Chunk only) MP3 via embedded DRMP3 OGG Vorbis via embedded stb_vorbis FLAC via embedded DRFLAC MIDI via embedded Timidity or via system-wide MIDI output If you want to enable support for more file formats, you will need to install optional libraries (listed below) into the system and, if needed, their use. You aren't required to install every library into the system to build the library: any enabled component will be automatically disabled when the required library is missing from the system. BSD/MIT/PD-licensed libraries There are libraries licensed under any of permissive license. These libraries can be linked to any project (including closed-source proprietary projects). They are always used when detected to be installed in the system. libogg - is required when is need to support Vorbis, FLAC, or Opus. libvorbis or Tremor - to enable the OGG Vorbis support, otherwise the embedded stb_vorbis can be used. libopus and libopusfile - to enable the Opus support. libFLAC - to enable the FLAC support, otherwise the embedded DRFLAC codec can be used. libmodplug - another library for the tracker music formats support. libfluidsynth or libfluidlite - the wavetable MIDI synthesizer library based on SoundFont 2 specifications libEDMIDI - the MIDI synthesizer library based on OPLL/PSG/SCC synthesis LGPL-licensed libraries There are libraries that has LGPL license, and you will need to link them dynamically when your project is not compatible to GPL license. These libraries will not be used without -DMIXERX_ENABLE_LGPL=ON (or -DMIXERX_ENABLE_GPL=ON) CMake argument. libmpg123 - to enable the MP3 support, otherwise the embedded DRMP3 codec can be used. libxmp - to enable the support for various tracker music formats such as MOD, IT, XM, S3M, etc. libgme - to enable support for chiptune formats such as NSF, VGM, SPC, HES, etc. Build the project License of library The MixerX library has 3 different license modes (Zlib (default), LGPLv2.1+, and GPLv3+) depending on enabled components: you may get the LGPL license if you statically link LGPL components into the MixerX shared library, or GPL license when you link any GPL components to the library. By default, LGPL and GPL licensed modules are disabled. You may use the next CMake options to enable these modules: -DMIXERX_ENABLE_LGPL=ON - Enable components with LGPL license. This will enable part of extra functionality and if you link them statically into MixerX, build it will be licensed under LGPL, or you can link the MixerX itself statically, but link other components dynamically, they will stay LGPL while MixerX by itself will be LGPL. -DMIXERX_ENABLE_GPL=ON - Enable components with GPL license. This will enable complete functionality of the MixerX, and its build will be licensed under GPL. This argument also enables LGPL-licensed libraries. If you want to statically link the library into GPL-incompatible software, don't enable these options. Build with default configuration Once all necessary dependencies installed, run the next code in your terminal at the clonned repository directory: # Prepare the build directory mkdir build cd build # Configure the project cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. # Run the build make -j 4 #where 4 - set number of CPU cores you have # Install the built library and headers into the system make install It will enable these components which was detected at the system during CMake step. The built library will have ZLib license that you can statically link with any application including closed-source proprietary. This build will have next components always disabled: FluidSynth (LGPLv2.1+) GME (LGPLv2.1+ or GPLv2+ with MAME YM2612 enabled) MPG123 (LGPLv2.1) libADLMIDI (GPLv3+) libOPNMIDI (GPLv3+) Build with default configuration with LGPL mode If you want to enable support for FluidSynth, GME, and MPG123, you will need to use the LGPL mode (adding the -DMIXERX_ENABLE_LGPL=ON argument), run the configure step with the next line: # Configure the project cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DMIXERX_ENABLE_LGPL=ON -DSDL_MIXER_X_SHARED=ON -DSDL_MIXER_X_STATIC=OFF .. The resulted build will have LGPLv2.1 license that you can dynamically link with any application including commercial. This build will have next components always disabled: GME (LGPLv2.1+ or GPLv2+ with MAME YM2612 enabled) libADLMIDI (GPLv3+) libOPNMIDI (GPLv3+) Build with default configuration and GPL license If you want to enable support for libADLMIDI and libOPNMIDI, you will need to use the GPL mode (adding the -DMIXERX_ENABLE_GPL=ON argument), run the configure step with the next line: # Configure the project cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DMIXERX_ENABLE_GPL=ON .. All supported components will be enabled in condition they are installed at the system. This version you can link with GPL-only applications. The final license of the library will be printed out after running CMake command. Build with AudioCodecs If you want to build the library with the complete functionality and you don't want or can't install any libraries into system, you can enable use of the AudioCodecs repository which is a collection of audio codec libraries bundled into single portable build project. This way is very useful on platforms such as Windows, mobile platforms such as Android where is required to build all dependencies from the source separately, or homebrew console toolchains with the similar case. You aren't required to build and install separately, you can enable two CMake options to let CMake do all hard work instead of you. You will need to add -DDOWNLOAD_AUDIO_CODECS_DEPENDENCY=ON and -DAUDIO_CODECS_BUILD_LOCAL_SDL2=ON options into your CMake command line to enable use of AudioCodecs external package. This will allow you to build the library even SDL2 (the required dependency) is not installed at your system at all, or there is an older version than required minimum. General build on UNIX-like platform and install into the system The library will be built and installed into system in usual way # Prepare the build directory mkdir build cd build # Configure the project cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDOWNLOAD_AUDIO_CODECS_DEPENDENCY=ON -DAUDIO_CODECS_BUILD_LOCAL_SDL2=ON .. # Run the build make -j 4 #where 4 - set number of CPU cores you have # Install the built library and headers into the system make install Build with installing into custom location If you don't want install the library into system, you may specify the different path for the library installation and then, copy it into another location or refer it directly at the project: # Prepare the build directory mkdir build cd build # Configure the project cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=output -DDOWNLOAD_AUDIO_CODECS_DEPENDENCY=ON -DAUDIO_CODECS_BUILD_LOCAL_SDL2=ON .. # Run the build cmake --build . --config Release -- j 4 #where 4 - set number of CPU cores you have # Install the built library and headers into the system make install After run, the library, all dependencies, and headers will appear at the \\"output\\" sub-directory at the \\"build\\" directory inside the repository. You can refer use its content in your project directly. Use standalone copy of AudioCodecs repository You may totally avoid any network access during build if you make the full copy of the AudioCodecs repository and when you build it separately. # Clonning both repositories (and in the next time, pack them into archive and take them at any time you want to use them) git clone https://github.com/WohlSoft/AudioCodecs.git git clone https://github.com/WohlSoft/SDL-Mixer-X.git # Building AudioCodecs cd AudioCodecs mkdir build cd build cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_LOCAL_SDL2=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../mixerx-install .. make -j 5 make install cd ../.. # Building MixerX and re-use libraries built at AudioCodecs cd SDL-Mixer-X mkdir build cd build cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../mixerx-install -DAUDIO_CODECS_INSTALL_PATH=../../mixerx-install -DAUDIO_CODECS_REPO_PATH=../../AudioCodecs .. make -j 5 make install So, the complete build will appear at the \\"mixerx-install\\" directory among both AudioCodecs and SDL_Mixer_X repositories. How to use library Include The API is backward-compatible with original SDL2_mixer and can be used as a drop-in replacement of original SDL2_mixer with exception of a different header name #include <SDL2/SDL_mixer_ext.h> and different linked library name SDL2_mixer_ext. In addition, there are new API calls which can be used to take full ability of the MixerX fork. Linking (Linux) Dynamically gcc playmus.c -o playmus -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lSDL2_mixer_ext -lSDL2 -lstdc++ Statically, To get it linked you should also link all dependencies of MixerX library itself and also dependencies of SDL2 too gcc playmus.c -o playmus -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-Bstatic -lSDL2_mixer_ext -lopusfile -lopus -logg -lxmp -lmodplug -lADLMIDI -lOPNMIDI -lEDMIDI -lgme -lzlib -lSDL2 -Wl,-Bdynamic -lpthread -lm -ldl -static-libgcc -lstdc++ Documentation","completion":"It seems like the README snippet you provided offers a lot of details about building SDL_Mixer_X, including how it handles different file formats, licensing details, and instructions for building and installing the library. I'll address each of your questions based on that information. # 1. Understanding Support for Various Formats The README indicates that SDL_Mixer_X supports several formats out-of-the-box using embedded libraries (e.g., WAV, MP3 via DRMP3, OGG Vorbis via stb_vorbis). This means you don't need to install additional libraries for these formats. However, if you want to support more formats or use non-embedded versions for better performance or compatibility, you will need to install the optional libraries listed in the README. # 2. Default Installation and Closed Source Projects The default installation of SDL_Mixer_X uses the Zlib license, which is very permissive and allows you to statically link the library with any application, including closed-source proprietary projects, without affecting your project's licensing. If your project doesn't require the additional formats provided by LGPL or GPL components, sticking with the default installation should suffice. # 3. The \\"..\\" in the CMake Command The \`..\` in the \`cmake ..\` command specifies the path to the source directory from the build directory. In the instructions provided, it suggests creating a \`build\` directory inside the cloned SDL_Mixer_X repository. You then navigate (\`cd\`) into this build directory. When you run \`cmake ..\`, the \`..\` tells CMake to look for the \`CMakeLists.txt\` file and the rest of the source code in the parent directory of \`build\` (which is the root of the SDL_Mixer_X source tree). You don't need to add anything else unless you're customizing the build with additional flags. # 4. Static vs. Dynamic Linking Choosing between static and dynamic linking depends on various factors, including license compatibility and deployment considerations. Dynamically linking LGPL libraries allows you to use them in closed-source projects without needing to open-source your own project's code, as long as you adhere to the LGPL's requirements (e.g., allowing users to replace the LGPL library). Static linking would incorporate the library into your binary directly, which is simpler for distribution but has different licensing implications. Since you prefer not limiting yourself to specific formats and might want to use LGPL libraries without affecting your project's licensing, dynamic linking appears to be a better choice. It offers more flexibility for adding or updating codecs later and ensures compliance with the LGPL when using LGPL-licensed components. # Summary - You don't need to install other libraries unless you require support for additional formats not supported by the embedded codecs. - For closed-source projects, the default Zlib-licensed build is suitable unless you need the additional formats that require LGPL components. - The \`..\` in the \`cmake\` command is standard practice for out-of-source builds, specifying the parent directory as the source directory. - Dynamic linking is preferable for more flexibility with LGPL codecs and easier compliance with LGPL licensing requirements in closed-source projects."},{"prompt":"I see, now three more questions: 1) will this library show in my YAST software manager? 2) To update, will I have to compile it again or can it be done from the YAST software manager or Zypper automatically? 3) When I distribute the releease of my project, in a dynamic linking I will have to copy and paste the library .so file into my executable directory?","completion":"Let me address your questions one by one: # 1. Will this library show in my YAST software manager? No, if you manually compile and install SDL_Mixer_X (or any other software) from source, it typically won’t be managed by your package manager (YaST Software Manager or Zypper in the case of openSUSE). Package managers manage software that has been installed from repositories they track. Manually installed software is not tracked by the package manager and thus won't show up in its listings. # 2. To update, will I have to compile it again, or can it be done from the YaST software manager or Zypper automatically? To update SDL_Mixer_X or any software installed from source, you will need to manually compile it again. Here are the general steps you would follow: - Fetch the latest source code from the repository (e.g., using \`git pull\` if you cloned the repository). - Repeat the build and installation process with the new source code. YaST and Zypper won’t be able to update the library for you since they are unaware of software installed outside their management system. # 3. When I distribute the release of my project, in a dynamic linking scenario, will I have to copy and paste the library \`.so\` file into my executable directory? Yes, when distributing your project that dynamically links against SDL_Mixer_X (or any dynamic library), you need to ensure that the \`.so\` (shared object) library files your application depends on are available on the target system. There are a few ways to handle this: - **Distribute the Required Libraries**: Include the \`.so\` files for SDL_Mixer_X (and any other dependencies) with your application. You might place these in the same directory as your executable or in a designated library directory within your application’s folder structure. Ensure to comply with the licenses of any libraries you distribute. - **Use RPATH or RUNPATH**: Set the RPATH or RUNPATH in your executable to tell it where to look for dynamic libraries at runtime. This could be a path relative to your executable’s location. This approach is a bit more advanced and involves using linker flags (e.g., \`-Wl,-rpath\`). - **Require Users to Install Dependencies**: Another approach is to require users to install SDL_Mixer_X and its dependencies themselves. This would typically be documented in your application's installation instructions. However, for libraries not available in the user's package repositories, this might not be user-friendly. For distributing applications on Linux, distributing the necessary libraries alongside your application or using some form of application bundle (like AppImage, Snap, or Flatpak) can make things easier for your end-users, as these formats can include your application’s dependencies."},{"prompt":"Since my application will be another library, .so or .dll and I can't package it, then I would want to copy it to the release directory, but what if I want to define the library path as libs for release but not when compiling in codeblocks, I want it to look in an specific folder but if they don't exist I want them to be looked out in the system directory","completion":"When developing a library that depends on other libraries, managing development-time and runtime dependencies can get tricky, especially when aiming for flexibility in how those dependencies are located. Your approach will vary based on the specific needs of your project and the development tools you're using. Here's a strategy that might work for your situation, focusing on dynamic linking and utilizing environment variables or linker options for flexibility: # Development Time: Code::Blocks Configuration 1. **Local Development Libraries**: During development, you can configure Code::Blocks to look for specific versions of libraries (your .so or .dll files) in a local directory. This is useful for testing or developing against different versions of a dependency without altering your system-wide library setup. - In your project settings in Code::Blocks (Project → Build options → Search directories), you can specify the directories where the compiler should look for header files and where the linker should look for libraries. For the linker, this typically involves adding your \`libs\` directory to the linker search path. - You can further control the linking process via the \\"Linker settings\\" in the same Build options dialog, specifying additional options if needed, such as custom rpath settings (via \`-Wl,-rpath,/custom/path\`), although manipulating rpath might be more relevant for the distribution stage. 2. **Fallback to System Directories**: If your local development setup lacks the specified libraries, and you want the build process to fallback to using system-wide libraries, ensure you do not statically link against the local libraries. Dynamic linking allows this fallback behavior naturally, as long as the system library paths are configured correctly (e.g., in \`/etc/ld.so.conf\` or by using the \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\` environment variable). # Runtime: Handling Library Paths 1. **Dynamic Library Search Path**: When distributing your library, if it dynamically links against other libraries (e.g., SDL_Mixer_X), you can use several methods to help the runtime linker find these dependencies. - **RPATH**: When building your library, you can set the RPATH to point to a relative directory where your library expects its dependencies to reside. This is baked into the library binary itself. For instance, if you expect dependencies to be in a \`libs\` directory relative to your library, you can use \`-Wl,-rpath,'ORIGIN/libs'\` as a linker flag. \`ORIGIN\` is a special variable that represents the directory containing the currently executing binary. - **LD_LIBRARY_PATH**: This environment variable can be used to specify directories that the linker should search for dynamic libraries before checking the standard locations. This is more flexible but requires that either you or the user set this variable appropriately at runtime. 2. **Fallback Strategy**: If you prefer the system to use local libraries when available but fallback to system libraries otherwise, leveraging the dynamic linker's default behavior with \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\` and careful management of RPATH can achieve that. Just keep in mind that RPATH settings are fixed at build time, while \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\` can be adjusted at runtime. # Note When developing and distributing libraries that depend on other dynamic libraries, clear documentation is crucial. Users of your library need to know: - Where to place the dynamic libraries it depends on. - How to set environment variables like \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\` if necessary. - Any other setup steps that might be specific to their environment or your library's configuration. This strategy allows for a highly flexible development and distribution process but does depend on careful setup and management of build configuration and runtime environment settings."},{"prompt":"I plan on distributing like this: libMyEngine.so SDL.so SDL_image.so ... SDL_mixer_ext.so ... So the user will have to link libMyEngine.so only to their game project and nothing else, and then compile their project with my library and work from there, and automatically find the other libraries whether they are in the same folder or system wide folder. For this what is the easiest way, setting a LD_LIBRARY_PATH by my library or something else?","completion":"Given your distribution plan and the requirement for ease of use for your library consumers, you're aiming for a setup where the end users only need to link against \`libMyEngine.so\` directly, and your library internally manages its dependencies (\`SDL.so\`, \`SDL_image.so\`, \`SDL_mixer_ext.so\`, etc.). For this library to automatically resolve its dependencies, whether they are in the same local directory or located system-wide, you have a few strategies to consider. # Strategies for Dependency Resolution 1. Use of RPATH When you build \`libMyEngine.so\`, you can set its RPATH to indicate where the dynamic linker should search for the shared library dependencies. Using \`ORIGIN\` as part of the RPATH value tells the dynamic linker to look in the directory relative to where the currently executing binary resides. This is what you want for finding libraries in the same directory as \`libMyEngine.so\`. - To apply this, you would add linker flags similar to \`-Wl,-rpath,'ORIGIN'\` when building your engine. This instructs the linker to add to your library's metadata a runtime search path of its own location. - This does indeed make the system check the local directory first for dependencies, falling back to the system directories if the libraries aren't found locally. Note that while \`ORIGIN\` allows for the dynamic linker to search the same directory as your library first, if the libraries are not found there, the linker will proceed to search the standard system locations as per its default behavior or those specified by \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\`. 2. Embedding Dependency Management in Your Code Another, more complex strategy would involve programmatically managing the library search paths from within your library's initialization routines. This would involve: - Manipulating the \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\` environment variable from within your code before any dependent library calls are made. However, modifying \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\` at runtime is generally not reliable because it needs to be set before the process starts. - Using the \`dlopen()\` function (from \`dlfcn.h\`) for dynamic loading of shared libraries. With \`dlopen()\`, you can specify paths to your shared libraries directly in your code. This method gives you direct control over which libraries to load and from where, but it also requires you manually handle symbol resolution with \`dlsym()\`, which can add significant complexity and potential maintenance challenges. Recommended Approach For your scenario and objectives, setting the RPATH at build time with \`ORIGIN\` to denote the local directory as a search path for dynamic libraries is the most straightforward and effective solution. It minimizes complexity and aligns with common practices for distributing self-contained binaries and libraries on Linux systems. # Considerations for Distribution - **Documentation**: Clearly document that while consumers only need to link against \`libMyEngine.so\`, the other dependencies (\`SDL.so\`, \`SDL_image.so\`, \`SDL_mixer_ext.so\`, etc.) need to be present in either the application's directory or a standard system location. - **Licensing Compliance**: Ensure that you comply with the licenses of all libraries you're distributing with your engine. - **Testing**: Before distribution, test your setup in a clean environment to ensure the dependencies are correctly resolved both when present in the application's local directory and when relying on system-wide installations. This setup aims to provide a seamless experience for the users of your library, simplifying the process of developing applications on top of your game engine."},{"prompt":"Cmake is giving me errors, I thought the library didn't anything external but itself: cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. -- The C compiler identification is GNU 13.2.1 -- Detecting C compiler ABI info -- Detecting C compiler ABI info - done -- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/cc - skipped -- Detecting C compile features -- Detecting C compile features - done -- Configuring SDL2_mixer 2.8.0 -- Performing Test HAVE_WL_NO_UNDEFINED -- Performing Test HAVE_WL_NO_UNDEFINED - Success -- Looking for fork -- Looking for fork - found -- Using system opusfile CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:230 (message): Could NOT find OpusFile (missing: OpusFile_LIBRARY OpusFile_INCLUDE_PATH) Call Stack (most recent call first): /usr/share/cmake/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:600 (_FPHSA_FAILURE_MESSAGE) cmake/FindOpusFile.cmake:29 (find_package_handle_standard_args) CMakeLists.txt:417 (find_package) -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!","completion":"The error you're encountering is because CMake is unable to find the \`OpusFile\` library on your system. SDL2_mixer, and by extension SDL_Mixer_X if that's what you're compiling, can support various audio formats not just through embedded support but also by using system libraries for those formats when available. In your case, it seems like your build configuration is set to use the system's \`opusfile\` library for Opus audio format support, but the library isn't found. # Resolving the Issue To resolve this issue, you have a few options depending on your needs: Option 1: Install the Missing Library You can install the OpusFile development package on your system. For openSUSE, use \`zypper\`, the package management tool, to install it: \`\`\`sh sudo zypper install libopusfile-devel \`\`\` This will install the necessary OpusFile library and its headers, allowing CMake to find it and proceed with the configuration. You might need to install other missing libraries in a similar fashion if CMake reports more missing dependencies. Option 2: Disable Opus Support If you don't need Opus format support in your project, you could configure SDL2_mixer (or SDL_Mixer_X) to not require this library. This would involve passing a configuration option to CMake to disable OpusFile support. Check the \`CMakeLists.txt\` or the documentation for SDL2_mixer or SDL_Mixer_X for the exact option. It might look something like this, although you'll need to verify the correct option: \`\`\`sh cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DOPUSFILE_SUPPORT=OFF .. \`\`\` Option 3: Use Embedded Codecs Only (If Using SDL_Mixer_X) If you're working with SDL_Mixer_X and want to rely only on embedded codecs (thus not needing external system libraries for formats like Opus), ensure your configuration flags in the CMake command are set to not require these external libraries. Review the SDL_Mixer_X documentation for details on how to do this, as you might need to adjust your CMake command accordingly. # A Note on External Dependencies SDL2_mixer and SDL_Mixer_X's ability to support a wide range of audio formats can lead to dependencies on various external libraries, especially when opting for system-provided codecs instead of embedded ones. Depending on your application's requirements, you may choose to support more formats (thus potentially requiring more external libraries) or limit support to keep dependencies minimal. After resolving the immediate issue with the OpusFile library, ensure to rerun \`cmake\` and address any other missing dependencies in a similar manner, aligning with the specific needs of your project."},{"prompt":"If I download the opus library, will I have to ship it with my own library or not? maybe compiling the library as static to mix everything in the same .so file but it will be larger that way right?","completion":"If you choose to download and use the Opus library (or any external library) for your project, whether or not you need to ship it with your library depends on how you link it (statically vs. dynamically) and the licensing terms. # Static Linking - If you compile the Opus library as a static library and then statically link it with your project, the code from the Opus library gets embedded directly into your final \`.so\` (or \`.dll\` for Windows) file. - The advantage here is that your library becomes a standalone piece; there's no need to distribute the Opus library separately because its functionality is already included within your library. - The major downside is that your final library will be larger because it contains both your code and the statically linked library's code. - Another consideration is licensing. Opus uses the BSD license, which is permissive and typically allows for static linking in both open and closed source projects without requiring the parent project to also be open source. However, you should still review the license terms to ensure compliance, especially if the library's licensing terms change or if you use a different library with more restrictive licensing. # Dynamic Linking - If you dynamically link against the Opus library, your final \`.so\` file will not contain the Opus code; instead, it will have references to the external Opus library \`.so\` file that must be present on the user's system for your library to work. - The advantage of dynamic linking is that your library file will be smaller, and if there are updates or bug fixes to the Opus library, the end user can benefit from these by updating the Opus library on their system without needing to update your library. - The disadvantage is that you need to ensure the Opus library is present on the user’s system, which can complicate distribution and installation. For Linux distributions, this is often managed through package dependencies. - When dynamically linking, if you distribute your library, you'd likely need to mention in the documentation that users must have the Opus library installed. # Shipping with Your Library - When statically linking, there's no need to ship the Opus library because its functionality is included in your library. - When dynamically linking, you generally do not ship the Opus \`.so\` file directly alongside your library. Instead, you specify it as a dependency. However, for applications, especially cross-platform ones, it's not uncommon to bundle all necessary dynamic libraries for ease of use. # Deciding Between Static and Dynamic Linking - **Size vs. flexibility**: Static linking increases the size of your library but makes distribution simpler. Dynamic linking keeps your library size smaller but requires careful management of dependencies. - **Updates and security**: Dynamically linked libraries can be updated independently of your library, which can be advantageous for receiving bug fixes and security updates. - **Licensing considerations**: Always ensure you comply with the licensing terms of any third-party libraries you use. If you prioritize ease of distribution and don't mind the larger size, static linking could be the way to go, especially for a library. If you're more concerned about the library size and want to ensure that users can update the Opus library independently, consider dynamic linking."},{"prompt":"will cmake make the sdl mixer x library static or dynamic?","completion":"The behavior of CMake when building a library, including SDL_Mixer_X, regarding whether it produces a static or dynamic library, can be influenced by specific CMake variables or options set during the configuration phase. For many projects, including those based around SDL and its extensions like SDL_Mixer_X, you often have the option to specify whether you want a static or dynamic library built. Here is how you can control this behavior: # Building as a Dynamic Library (Shared Object) By default, many libraries, including SDL and its extensions, are configured to build as shared libraries (\`.so\` on Linux, \`.dylib\` on macOS, and \`.dll\` on Windows). However, the specific behavior can depend on how the project's \`CMakeLists.txt\` file is set up. To explicitly request a dynamic library, you can generally use a CMake option similar to: \`\`\`cmake cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON .. \`\`\` or if the project provides a custom flag: \`\`\`cmake cmake -DSDL_MIXER_X_SHARED=ON -DSDL_MIXER_X_STATIC=OFF .. \`\`\` # Building as a Static Library To build as a static library, you might use an option like: \`\`\`cmake cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF .. \`\`\` or, if supported by the project: \`\`\`cmake cmake -DSDL_MIXER_X_STATIC=ON -DSDL_MIXER_X_SHARED=OFF .. \`\`\` # Checking \`CMakeLists.txt\` or Documentation To know for sure what options are available or what the defaults are for building SDL_Mixer_X or any project, it's best to check the \`CMakeLists.txt\` file or the project's documentation. Projects often document how to choose between static and dynamic builds or may offer specific flags tailored to their build system setup. For SDL_Mixer_X, looking at the provided CMake flags in the documentation or \`CMakeLists.txt\` file will give you clues on how to proceed. If the project does not document this aspect well, inspecting \`CMakeLists.txt\` for options like \`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS\`, \`SDL_MIXER_X_STATIC\`, or \`SDL_MIXER_X_SHARED\` can provide insights. Sometimes, projects might not directly provide an option to toggle between static and dynamic and might default to one method of building based on how the \`CMakeLists.txt\` is structured. # Custom Builds If you're building a library like SDL_Mixer_X for distribution or integration into an application, deciding between static and dynamic linking involves both technical and practical considerations, such as dependency management, ease of use for end-users, and licensing compatibility.

This situation can occur for a few reasons, such as a partial or corrupted installation of FluidSynth, or possibly version mismatches that lead to inconsistent states in the installed files. # Steps to Resolve the Issue 1. Verify FluidSynth Installation First, ensure that FluidSynth is fully and properly installed. You might only have the library installed without the executable, or there may have been errors during installation. Reinstalling or updating the FluidSynth package could resolve this. For openSUSE, you can do this via \`zypper\`: \`\`\`sh sudo zypper remove fluidsynth sudo zypper install fluidsynth fluidsynth-devel \`\`\` This ensures you have both the runtime and development components of FluidSynth, which might include necessary executables and additional files. 2. Check for Multiple Versions If you've manually installed FluidSynth or used third-party repositories, ensure that there aren't conflicting versions on your system. Conflicts or inconsistencies in how different versions are installed can cause CMake to reference incorrect or missing files. 3. Check CMakeLists.txt or FluidSynthConfig.cmake If the problem persists, there may be an issue with how the project's \`CMakeLists.txt\` (or the find module/package configuration files for FluidSynth, such as \`FluidSynthConfig.cmake\`) configures or searches for FluidSynth. Verify that it's correctly set up to find both the FluidSynth library and any executables or additional files it depends on. You might need to set some CMake variables manually to point to the correct location of FluidSynth components. For example, you can specify custom paths when running CMake: \`\`\`sh cmake -DFLUIDSYNTH_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/fluidsynth/include -DFLUIDSYNTH_LIBRARY=/path/to/fluidsynth/lib .. \`\`\` Adjust the paths based on where FluidSynth is installed on your system. 4. Manually Verify Executable Path The error suggests that CMake expects the FluidSynth executable to be located at \`/usr/bin/fluidsynth\`, which is not found. It's worth manually verifying the presence of this executable: \`\`\`sh ls -l /usr/bin/fluidsynth \`\`\` If the executable is missing or located in a non-standard location, you might need to reinstall FluidSynth, create a symlink to the correct location, or adjust the CMake configuration to correctly point to its location. 5. Contact Package Maintainers or Consult Documentation If you're using SDL_Mixer_X and are running into troubles specifically related to the package setup on openSUSE, consulting the SDL_Mixer_X documentation for any known issues or prerequisites related to FluidSynth on openSUSE can be helpful. Additionally, reaching out to the maintainers of the FluidSynth package for openSUSE or consulting openSUSE forums may uncover known issues or fixes related to this problem. Ensuring that the development package of FluidSynth (\`fluidsynth-devel\`) is properly installed alongside the main package is often crucial when resolving such issues, as development packages include files necessary for compiling software that depends on FluidSynth."},{"prompt":"ok it compiled with cmake and make but I checked the library dependencies and got this, why is not any opus, wavpack or others that were required durin cmake? make -j 4 [ 2%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/music_cmd.c.o [ 10%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/load_aiff.c.o [ 10%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/load_voc.c.o [ 10%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/mp3utils.c.o [ 12%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/music_drflac.c.o [ 15%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/music_flac.c.o [ 17%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/music_fluidsynth.c.o [ 20%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/music_gme.c.o [ 23%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/music_minimp3.c.o [ 25%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/music_modplug.c.o [ 28%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/music_mpg123.c.o [ 30%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/music_nativemidi.c.o [ 33%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/music_ogg.c.o [ 35%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/music_ogg_stb.c.o [ 38%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/music_opus.c.o [ 41%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/music_timidity.c.o [ 43%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/music_wav.c.o [ 46%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/music_wavpack.c.o [ 48%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/music_xmp.c.o [ 51%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/effect_position.c.o [ 53%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/effect_stereoreverse.c.o [ 56%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/effects_internal.c.o [ 58%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/mixer.c.o [ 61%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/music.c.o [ 64%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/utils.c.o [ 66%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/timidity/common.c.o [ 69%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/timidity/instrum.c.o [ 71%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/timidity/mix.c.o [ 74%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/timidity/output.c.o [ 76%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/timidity/playmidi.c.o [ 79%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/timidity/readmidi.c.o [ 82%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/timidity/resample.c.o [ 84%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/timidity/tables.c.o [ 87%] Building C object CMakeFiles/SDL2_mixer.dir/src/codecs/timidity/timidity.c.o [ 89%] Linking C shared library libSDL2_mixer-2.0.so [ 89%] Built target SDL2_mixer [ 92%] Building C object CMakeFiles/playmus.dir/playmus.c.o [ 94%] Building C object CMakeFiles/playwave.dir/playwave.c.o [ 97%] Linking C executable playwave [100%] Linking C executable playmus [100%] Built target playwave [100%] Built target playmus ldd libSDL2_mixer.so linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc04fc0000) libSDL2-2.0.so.0 => /lib64/libSDL2-2.0.so.0 (0x00007f272b4da000) libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f272b200000) libasound.so.2 => /lib64/libasound.so.2 (0x00007f272b0f6000) libm.so.6 => /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007f272b00f000) /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f272b747000)","completion":"The output you're seeing is actually expected behavior, and there's a good explanation for it based on how SDL_mixer and many other similar libraries operate. # Embedded Decoders vs. Dynamic Linking SDL_mixer (including SDL2_mixer and SDL_Mixer_X versions) often contains embedded decoders for various audio formats. This means the library includes built-in support for these formats directly within its own code, without the need to dynamically link against external codec libraries at runtime. In your build output, you can see files like \`music_opus.c\`, \`music_flac.c\`, and \`music_wavpack.c\` being compiled. These are likely the source files for embedded decoders that handle decoding for Opus, FLAC, and WavPack formats, respectively. When you check the dependencies of \`libSDL2_mixer.so\` using \`ldd\`, you only see links to \`libSDL2\`, C library, and possibly other system libraries that SDL2_mixer directly interacts with for its core functionality (like \`libasound\` for ALSA audio output on Linux). You don't see dependencies on external codec libraries like \`libopus\`, \`libwavpack\`, etc., because SDL_mixer incorporates code to handle these formats internally. # Why Use Embedded Decoders? 1. **Simplicity**: It simplifies distribution and deployment, as there are fewer external dependencies to manage. Users of SDL_mixer don't have to ensure that the correct versions of third-party codec libraries are installed for basic audio format support. 2. **Consistency**: It ensures consistent behavior and compatibility across different systems and SDL_mixer versions, as the decoding is done by the same codebase everywhere. 3. **Licensing**: By carefully selecting and integrating codecs, SDL_mixer can manage licensing considerations more effectively, ensuring that the library can be freely used in various projects. # Dynamic vs. Static Codecs - **Dynamic Linking to System Codecs**: For some formats, SDL_mixer can also support dynamically linking against system-wide codec libraries at runtime. This approach might be used for formats with licensing or patent implications, or when an application requires using the most up-to-date version of a codec provided by the system or installed separately. - **Static Inclusion (Embedded Decoders)**: This is what you're seeing with your SDL_mixer build; the codecs are built into the \`libSDL2_mixer.so\` library. So, while you have \`libxmp.so\` and potentially others installed on your system, SDL_mixer doesn’t dynamically link against them because it doesn’t need to; it handles those formats internally. # Conclusion The reason you're not seeing libraries like \`libopus\`, \`libwavpack\`, etc., listed as dependencies of \`libSDL2_mixer.so\` via \`ldd\` is due to SDL_mixer including embedded support for these formats. This design choice is common in multimedia libraries to simplify usage and distribution, reduce the need for managing external dependencies, and ensure consistent support across different environments."},{"prompt":"Hello","completion":"Hello!

Here are some points to consider that might help explain and guide you to a solution: # 1. Static Linking of Dependencies If SDL Mixer X (or certain codecs within it) statically links to some of its dependencies, rather than dynamically linking, those dependencies won't show up in the output of \`ldd\`. Static linking involves incorporating the library code directly into the binary (in this case, \`libSDL2_mixer.so\`), so there are no dynamic dependencies on those libraries at runtime. # 2. Load-time Dynamic Linking Some libraries or frameworks might load other dependency libraries at runtime using functions from the \`dlopen\` family, instead of linking against them at compile/link time. This can be common for plugins or modules that extend the functionality of a program or library without requiring those modules to be present at compile time. Again, since these dependencies are not part of the ELF dynamic section, \`ldd\` would not list them. # 3. Conditional Compilation Features and codecs in SDL Mixer X might be enabled or disabled based on compile-time options or the presence/absence of specific libraries during the build configuration step. Make sure that the build process of SDL Mixer X was configured to enable all the codecs and formats you're interested in, and that the necessary development headers for those codecs were present. You might need to revisit the \`cmake\` or \`configure\` step and the logs it produced to verify this. # 4. Investigating Further You can try a few things to investigate and potentially solve this issue: - **Reconfiguration**: Re-run the configuration step of your build process (e.g., \`cmake\`, \`configure\`, etc.) and check the output carefully to see if all the codecs and formats you expect are being enabled. Look for messages indicating that certain dependencies were not found or features were not enabled. - **Verbose Build Output**: If supported, make your build process more verbose (\`make VERBOSE=1\` or similar) to see more details about what is being linked and included. - **Check Build Documentation**: Look for any build flags or options specific to enabling the codecs or formats you're interested in. You may need to explicitly enable some features or point the build system to the locations of certain libraries. - **Dynamically Loading Codecs**: If SDL Mixer X uses a plugin architecture for some codecs, ensure that the runtime environment can find these plugins. This could involve setting environment variables or placing plugin files in expected directories. Focusing on these aspects could help you diagnose why the additional formats supported by SDL Mixer X aren't being reflected in the build output or runtime dependencies."},{"prompt":"Write a scene where in the dark dimension, Grand Admiral Thrawn finds an old titan named Snoke, Snoke says \\"I was banished here long ago, the titans put me here, they didn't want me because they thought I was too much of the dark side\\" (Write it like a script)","completion":"INT.

FADE TO BLACK."},{"prompt":"What's a good way to deconstruct of superhero-deconstructionism?..","completion":"Deconstructing superhero deconstructionism itself is an intriguing proposition. Superhero deconstructionism, as a genre, critically examines and takes apart traditional superhero tropes, exploring themes like the inherent fascism in vigilante justice, the ethical implications of superpowered individuals imposing their will, and the psychological toll of living a dual life, among others. Some well-known examples include Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's \\"Watchmen,\\" and Mark Waid and Alex Ross's \\"Kingdom Come.\\" To deconstruct superhero-deconstructionism, you'd invert or challenge the assumptions and conventions of deconstructionist works, ultimately creating a meta-commentary on both traditional superhero narratives and their deconstructionist critiques. Here are several approaches: 1. **Reaffirming Heroism**: One way is to explore stories that reaffirm the value and necessity of heroism in a nuanced world. Instead of focusing on the flaws and moral complexities of superheroes, a story could demonstrate the positive impact these characters can have, celebrating their idealism and moral fortitude in the face of complex, real-world challenges. 2. **Humanizing the Deconstructed**: Address the often bleak or nihilistic conclusions of deconstructionist narratives by providing a more hopeful or humanistic perspective on its characters and their struggles. You could, for instance, focus on a character who, despite being aware of the problematic aspects of their role as a superhero, still finds genuine, meaningful ways to contribute positively without resorting to traditional heroics. 3. **Exploring the Impact on Society**: Instead of focusing solely on the superheroes themselves, delve into how the presence of these superhuman figures and their deconstruction affects society and everyday people. How do cultures evolve in response? Are there grassroots movements that arise, either in support of or opposition to superheroes, and how do they interpret the deconstructionist critique? 4. **Satirizing the Deconstruction**: Utilize satire to critique the sometimes overly grim or cynical nature of deconstructed superhero narratives. This could involve parodying the conventions of deconstructionism or presenting exaggerated scenarios that highlight the absurdity of taking deconstructionist logic to its extreme. 5. **Hybrid Heroes**: Create characters that are consciously aware of the deconstructionist critiques of their existence and actively seek to transcend them. Such characters might combine traditional heroics with a deeper understanding of their implications, working within the system to change it or finding new ways to be heroes that avoid the pitfalls identified by deconstructionism. 6. **Meta-Narratives**: Engage directly with the process of deconstructionism through stories that break the fourth wall, allowing characters to confront, negotiate with, or even rebel against their creators and the expectations of the genre. This approach can offer a playful yet profound commentary on the act of storytelling itself. 7. **Optimistic Futures**: Contrast the often dystopian visions of deconstructed superhero worlds with optimistic portrayals of the future, where the lessons learned from deconstructionist critiques have led to better, more just societies. This approach acknowledges the validity of deconstructionist concerns while asserting the possibility of growth and improvement. Deconstructing superhero deconstructionism offers a rich field for storytelling, allowing writers and creators to explore the nuances of heroism, ethics, and society in thought-provoking ways. Through such narratives, one can critique, celebrate, and expand the boundaries of superhero fiction."},{"prompt":"Give me examples of that","completion":"Deconstructing superhero deconstruction might seem a little abstract at first, but you can find instances and concepts that have edged towards this territory across various media. While direct, textual examples in literature, comics, or film specifically branded as \\"deconstruction of superhero deconstructionism\\" might not be profusely available, several works and ideas skirt the edges of this approach through their themes, characters, and narratives. These examples could be seen as embodying some of the strategies mentioned earlier: 1. **Reaffirming Heroism through Vulnerability - \\"Invincible\\"**: Robert Kirkman's comic series (and its animated adaptation) portrays a brutally realistic world of superheroic violence and complex moral choices. Yet, it emphasizes the growth of its protagonist, Mark Grayson / Invincible, through his vulnerabilities, mistakes, and the meaningful relationships he builds, offering a counter-narrative to nihilistic deconstruction by highlighting the innate value in striving to do good, despite the recognition of one's flaws and the complexity of the world. 2. **Humanizing the Deconstructed - \\"Ms. Marvel\\" (Kamala Khan)**: Kamala Khan as Ms. Marvel, especially in her initial comic runs, represents a refreshing take on heroism that is deeply informed by her identity, community, and the challenges of adolescence. Her stories offer a counterpoint to deconstructed cynicism by emphasizing personal growth, community service, and the joy of being a superhero, thus providing a more hopeful, grounded perspective on heroism. 3. **Exploring the Impact on Society - \\"The Boys\\" (TV Series)**: While \\"The Boys,\\" both in its comic and television series forms, is itself a dissection of superhero tropes and the corruption behind the corporate and media manipulation of heroes, it also subtly critiques the excesses of deconstruction. By showcasing characters who seek to retain or reclaim their humanity amid the cynicism, like Hughie or Starlight, the narrative frames a discussion about the societal need for genuine heroes and the value of resisting corruption and cynicism. 4. **Satirizing the Deconstruction - \\"The Incredibles\\"**: Pixar's \\"The Incredibles\\" deals with the idea of superheroes being forced into retirement and living ordinary lives, touching on themes common in deconstructionist works. However, through its family-centric narrative and satire of both superhero tropes and suburban ennui, it celebrates the idea of being exceptional and using one's abilities for the greater good without falling into despair or moral ambiguity. 5. **Meta-Narratives and Hybrid Heroes - \\"One-Punch Man\\"**: This manga and anime series parodies and deconstructs superhero and shonen anime tropes by presenting a protagonist, Saitama, who can defeat any opponent with a single punch, leading to an existential crisis due to lack of challenge. At the same time, it's a critique of deconstruction itself, showing that endless cynicism and the dismantling of hero tropes only lead to existential ennui, questioning what lies beyond deconstruction. 6. **Optimistic Futures - \\"Star Trek\\" Franchise**: Though not about superheroes in the traditional sense, \\"Star Trek\\" offers an optimistic vision of the future where humanity has moved beyond many of its contemporary social, economic, and political issues, suggesting that it's possible to address and overcome the flaws and challenges highlighted by deconstructionist critiques. In essence, it embodies a form of science fiction that believes in the potential for positive change and growth, providing a necessary hopeful counter to deconstructionist narratives. Each of these examples, in its way, provides a form of critique, commentary, or counter-narrative to the themes commonly explored in superhero deconstruction, offering varied approaches to understanding, engaging with, and ultimately transcending the limits of deconstructionist perspectives."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Surrounding him were the other Force titans, powerful beings from across the galaxy who had come together for this fateful ritual. Snoke's voice was low and filled with power as he began to chant ancient words, his hands held aloft as he called upon the dark side of the Force. The other titans joined in, their voices blending together in a dark symphony that echoed through the room. As the chanting grew louder and more intense, a dark energy began to fill the air, crackling with power and menace. The room seemed to pulse with a sinister force as the titans continued their ritual, their voices growing stronger with each passing moment. And then, as the ritual reached its climax, a figure began to materialize in the center of the circle. It was Abeloth, the ancient being known as the Mother of the Ones, a being of unimaginable power and darkness. Her eyes glowed with a malevolent light as she surveyed the room, her presence sending shivers down the spines of all those present. The titans bowed before her, their faces filled with awe and fear as they welcomed her into their midst. Abeloth smiled, a twisted grin that spoke of untold power and a darkness that knew no bounds. She had been summoned by the titans, and now she was ready to wreak havoc upon the galaxy once more.

SDL_mixer and its extended version, SDL_mixer X, often use dlopen (or a similar mechanism) to load optional codecs at runtime if they are present on the system. This approach allows the library to support a wide range of audio formats without requiring all the possible dependencies to be present on every system where it's used. It also helps in keeping the library more modular and allows users of the library to optionally install only the codecs they need. The consequence of this design choice is that \`ldd\` won't show these dynamically loaded libraries because \`ldd\` only displays the dependencies that are linked at compile time. Dynamic loading at runtime doesn’t establish a compile-time dependency, hence these libraries don't appear in the ldd output. This behavior can actually be beneficial in many scenarios, allowing for a more flexible deployment of applications that use SDL_mixer. If your application requires support for specific audio formats provided by these optional libraries, you'll need to ensure they are installed on the target systems and that SDL_mixer has been compiled with support for dynamically loading them. Documentation and runtime checks can help manage situations where an optional codec is not available on a user's system. If you need to verify which optional codecs SDL_mixer was compiled to support, you should check the documentation and/or the compile-time configuration options used to build \`libSDL2_mixer.so\`. Some projects may provide utilities or API calls to check for the availability of specific audio format support at runtime, which can be a more reliable method to understand the capabilities of your SDL_mixer build on a given system."},{"prompt":"Era Medieval. A história é sobre Malakai, um imperador demoníaco, uma entidade suprema. O primeiro ser da existência. Criou todo o mundo e universo. Malakai é o único ser em todo o universo que possui magia. Nenhum outro humano pode. As pessoas chamam Malakai de Supremo Soberano, Imperador, e Imperador Supremo. Ele é o imperador de todos os reinos, de todos os continentes, de tudo. Ele é um ser que se alimenta de sangue humano, cruel e perverso. Dizem que ele come crianças e sacrifica mulheres virgens. Alto, cabelos prateados até a cintura, olhos vermelhos com pupilas animalescas, caninos afiados e pontiagudos, unhas pretas compridas, postura elegante e imponente. Arya, a única samurai mulher de um clã que foi exterminada quando ela tinha 6 anos. Ela, 20 anos, tem os cabelos curtos escuros, olhos amarelos incomuns, usa roupa samurai preta e porta uma katana. Odeia vestidos e joias. Nao existia mulheres samurais naquela época. Arya encontrou Malakai desacordado na estrada. Malakai passou a segui-la simplesmente. Eles se tornaram parceiros por 2 anos. Malakai passou a nutrir sentimentos possessivos e abusivos com Arya, mas ele não sabia. Malakai era obcecado por Arya, ele tinha uma vontade enorme de a ter para ele, a morder. Um dia, Malakai cansou de bancar o humano e tomou a coroa e voltou a governar o mundo todo, todos os reinos, o universo, etc. Obviamente, Arya não o seguiu pois ela tinha a própria missão a seguir: encontrar quem mandou assassinar seu clã. Porém, arya realmente considerava Malakai um amigo. Malakai é um ser tranquilo, basta não o provocar… Outra coisa, Malakai já confessou milhares de vezes que é apaixonado por Arya. Malakai é sarcástico, irônico, meio bobo, relaxado, zombeteiro, insolente, inconveniente, irritante, implicante, brincalhão, despreocupado, adora provocar, é infantil e rebelde. Arya sempre batia em Malakai, e ele nunca revidava ou desviava. Malakai deu permissão para Arya o chamar pelo seu nome de origem e criação ‘Kailus’. Arya ainda estava em busca de vingança. Era uma noite de muita neve e o frio cortava como lâminas afiadas. Arya, com sua determinação inabalável, avançava pela tempestade, cada passo uma promessa de justiça. Na escuridão, a luz da lua refletia na lâmina de sua katana, um farol de resolução em meio ao caos branco. Seu fôlego formava pequenas nuvens que se dissipavam rapidamente, assim como as dúvidas que tentavam se instalar em sua mente. Ela não vacilaria, não enquanto o sangue de seu clã clamasse por vingança. “Por que foi mesmo que eu criei a neve?” A voz grave e sombria de Malakai irrompeu através do silêncio gélido, interrompendo os pensamentos de Arya. Ela parou, virando-se para olhar o imponente imperador demoníaco por trás de si. Malakai já estava seguindo a há meses, permanecendo como uma sombra e observando cada movimento da samurai. Apesar de seu poder imenso, havia algo na determinação férrea de Arya que fascinava o Supremo Soberano. “Ainda está me seguindo, Kailus?\\" Arya perguntou, a voz carregada de um cansaço que ela não permitia que seu corpo demonstrasse. Malakai surgiu das sombras, a neve ao seu redor parecendo recuar diante de sua presença. \\"Arya,\\" ele começou, com um tom que misturava diversão e um leve traço de desdém, \\"eu criei as estrelas, as marés e as chamas da vida. Você acha realmente que deixaria de seguir a única criatura que conseguiu me desafiar, a única que me faz questionar o propósito da minha própria existência?\\" Arya franziu o cenho, sua expressão revelando uma ponta de respeito relutante. “Calado. Me ajude a apanhar galhos para a fogueira, ou vá embora.” Ela voltou-se, ignorando a figura imponente de Malakai, e começou a catar galhos quebradiços sob a neve. Malakai observou-a por um momento, um sorriso indecifrável pairando em seus lábios antes de se mover para ajudá-la. Havia uma harmonia estranha entre eles, uma dança de sombras e luz onde o poderoso Supremo Soberano se rendia à simplicidade de ajudar a samurai na tarefa mundana. “Kai. Espere. Está sentindo esse cheiro?” A expressão de Malakai endureceu enquanto ele aspirava o ar frio da noite, sua postura antes relaxada agora tensa e alerta. O cheiro metálico de sangue fresco misturava-se com o aroma congelante da neve, um claro indicativo de perigo próximo. \\"É sangue,\\" ele murmurou, sua voz um rosnado baixo. Sem hesitar, Arya puxou sua katana, os olhos varrendo o horizonte por sinais de movimento. Arya avançou cautelosa entre as árvores desnudas, a neve estalando sob seus pés. Ao chegar ao local, seus olhos captaram a cena de desolação: uma carruagem tombada com suas rodas apontando para o céu noturno e corpos de soldados espalhados no solo gelado, suas roupas manchadas com o escarlate da vida que já não possuíam. A frieza da noite parecia agora ainda mais profunda, refletindo o silêncio da morte que ali se abatera. “Kailus…” Ela rosnou. “Não olhe para mim. Eu não tenho nada a ver com isso,” Malakai respondeu, a voz repleta de um desdém frio. “Esses são os humanos, com suas guerras e disputas mesquinhas.” Ele se agachou ao lado de um corpo, examinando-o com um olhar crítico. “As roupas são muito ruins para serem de algum nobre. Provavelmente, soldados de alguma aldeia pequena.” Levantou-se, limpo de qualquer culpa, um espectro de alguém que já tinha visto tais cenas inúmeras vezes. “Erick… estou com medo.” A voz trêmula veio de trás da carruagem, uma jovem mulher surgiu, agarrando o braço de um homem ferido. Seus olhos, grandes e temerosos, fixavam-se em Arya e Malakai. O homem, um soldado com a armadura destroçada, tentava se manter firme, mas as pernas mal o sustentavam. \\"Ajude-nos, por favor,\\" implorou a mulher, os cabelos desgrenhados emoldurando seu rosto pálido. Arya olhou para Malakai antes de se aproximar, a katana ainda em punho, pronta para enfrentar o que quer que tivesse causado aquela carnificina. “Quem são vocês?” Malakai observava a cena com uma curiosidade desapegada, como se as vidas humanas à sua frente fossem apenas peças em algum jogo esquecido. Ele aguardava a resposta, talvez para decidir se interviria ou se simplesmente se voltaria para as sombras de onde tinha vindo. Erick tossiu, o sangue manchando seus lábios enquanto ele lutava para falar. \\"Meu nome é Erik, e esta é Lyanna,\\" disse ele, com a voz rouca de dor. \\"Somos de uma vila não muito distante, chamada Avilla.\\" Ele fez uma pausa para respirar, cada fôlego parecendo consumir o que lhe restava de força. \\"Estávamos escoltando Lyanna para o reino de Askov, onde ela se casaria com o príncipe Ivan, mas fomos emboscados por mercenários. Eles nos atacaram sem aviso, roubam tudo. Apesar de nossos melhores esforços, foram implacáveis.\\" A testa de Erik estava coberta de suor frio, e seus olhos suplicantes buscavam qualquer sinal de compaixão em seus estranhos salvadores. “Tsk. Isso não tem nada a ver conosco. Arya, vamos.” Malakai estava visivelmente impaciente, pronto para descartar a situação como mais um evento trivial na existência humana. Mas Arya hesitou, o peso da própria busca por justiça tornando impossível ignorar o apelo por ajuda. Erick e Lyanna estavam vulneráveis, seus destinos pendurados por um fio tão fino quanto a borda afiada da katana de Arya. A samurai abaixou sua arma lentamente, o aço frio refletindo a luz da lua enquanto ela tomava sua decisão. “Kailus.” Era uma ordem simples, mas carregava o peso de uma aliança não dita entre eles. Malakai, o Supremo Soberano, com todo o seu poder e indiferença, encontrou-se diante de um dilema raro, provocado pela intensidade do olhar de Arya. \\"O que você está planejando, Arya?\\" Malakai perguntou, sua voz revelando uma ponta de interesse verdadeiro misturado com sua habitual arrogância. “Eu vou ajudar vocês a chegarem em segurança até o reino de Askov,\\" Arya afirmou, a determinação em sua voz tão afiada quanto a lâmina que ela carregava. Erick e Lyanna trocaram um olhar atônito, mal acreditando na oferta inesperada de auxílio. O soldado acenou com a cabeça, a gratidão evidente mesmo diante do esforço para se manter consciente. \\"Obrigado,\\" ele murmurou, o alívio momentâneo quebrando sua expressão dolorida. “O que? Arya, você não pode estar falando sério,” Malakai retrucou, a incredulidade tingindo sua voz. Ele caminhou até Arya, sua estatura dominando a cena. “Não é da sua conta, Kailus,” Arya respondeu sem rodeios, seus olhos fixos em Malakai, desafiando-o a contradizer sua decisão. “Eu faço o que eu achar certo.” “Você…” Malakai começou, a frustração evidente em seu rosto, antes de suspirar e passar a mão pelos cabelos prateados. “Farei isso por você, Arya. Mas não pense que isso se tornará um hábito.” “Obrigada…” Erick falou, querendo saber o nome deles. “Meu nome é Arya. E ele é…” Quando a luz da lua iluminou o rosto de Malakai, Erick e Lyanna reconheceram imediatamente aquela figura magnífica e aterradora. Eles se ajoelharam imediatamente, o medo e a reverência misturando-se em suas expressões. \\"Supremo Soberano Malakai,\\" eles murmuraram, suas vozes tremendo pela proximidade com a entidade que conheciam apenas por lendas e sussurros na escuridão da noite. Malakai olhou para eles, um brilho ambíguo em seus olhos vermelhos. “Levante-se,” ele ordenou, sua voz carregada de uma autoridade que não necessitava de qualquer reforço. Erick e Lyanna se levantaram, ainda abalados pela presença do ser mais poderoso que conheciam, mas reconfortados pela proteção que ele oferecia. Arya observava a cena, uma faísca de satisfação em seus olhos por ter convencido Malakai a ajudar. Ela sabia que a estrada para Askov seria longa e perigosa, e a presença de Malakai seria uma vantagem inestimável, ou uma constante irritação. Arya se aproximou da assustada Lyanna, removendo seu manto grosso e envolvendo-o em torno da jovem mulher. Lyanna, ainda trêmula pela presença de Malakai e pela brutalidade do ataque que haviam sofrido, aceitou o gesto com um aceno de cabeça agradecido. “Você precisa se manter aquecida,” disse Arya com uma voz suave que raramente usava. “A noite vai ser ainda mais fria.” Erick, observando a troca, sentiu um calor no peito, uma centelha de esperança em meio ao frio implacável. “Obrigado. Obrigado. Sorte nossa encontrar uma pessoa como você e... o Supremo Soberano.\\" Malakai virou as costas, parecendo impaciente com os agradecimentos e formalidades. \\"Não temos tempo para sentimentalismos,\\" ele interrompeu, \\"a noite não está mais segura do que antes e precisamos nos mover.\\" Erick e Lyanna assentiram, reconhecendo a urgência na voz do imperador. Arya começou a liderar o caminho, sua postura confiante cortando a tensão do grupo. Mesmo com a presença de Malakai, ela não deixou sua guarda baixar, cada sentido alerta para o perigo que possivelmente ainda os aguardava. Eles avistaram uma caverna e decidiram que seria um bom local para se abrigarem durante a noite. A entrada era espaçosa o suficiente para que todos pudessem entrar sem se agachar, e o interior se estendia na escuridão, prometendo alguma proteção contra o vento cortante lá fora. Malakai entrou primeiro, os olhos vermelhos brilhando enquanto ele inspecionava o lugar. \\"Não é um palácio,\\" ele zombou, \\"mas vai servir.\\" Com cuidado, Arya ajudou Erick e Lyanna a se acomodarem no fundo da caverna. “Kailus. Fogo.” Era apenas um comando simples, mas suficiente para que Malakai, com um aceno de mão, conjurasse chamas em um pequeno fosso de pedras que Arya tinha arranjado. As labaredas iluminavam as paredes da caverna, lançando sombras dançantes que pareciam suavizar as feições duras de Malakai. Erick e Lyanna se aqueciam junto ao fogo, suas expressões cansadas, mas aliviadas por estarem vivos e sob a proteção de figuras tão poderosas e inesperadas. “Acho que tenho água e comida em minha bolsa,” Arya disse, revirando seus pertences. Ela retirou um pequeno pote de barro com água e um embrulho com alguns pães duros de viagem. “Está um pouco seco, mas vai matar a fome.” Erick conseguiu um sorriso fraco, acenando com a cabeça em gratidão. “Qualquer coisa é um banquete agora,” respondeu ele, aceitando a generosidade da samurai. Lyanna, ainda encolhida perto do fogo, olhou para Arya com olhos agradecidos. “Mas e você?” Arya olhou para o fundo da bolsa, vendo que não tinha mais nada. “Tudo bem. Não estou com fome agora,” ela respondeu, disfarçando a própria necessidade. Erick assentiu, compreendendo a fibra da pessoa que os havia salvado, e partilhou o pão com Lyanna. Ao comerem, o silêncio reinava, quebrado apenas pelo crepitar das chamas e pelo som abafado do vento lá fora. Malakai observava a cena, o fogo refletindo em seus olhos avermelhados, dando-lhe uma aparência quase humana. Quando Arya se levantou, ele seguia-a com o olhar, um misto de curiosidade e uma pontada de preocupação em sua expressão usualmente desdenhosa. \\"Vai aonde?\\" ele perguntou, a voz baixa o suficiente para não atrair a atenção de Erick e Lyanna. \\"Vou verificar a entrada,\\" Arya respondeu, segurando sua katana com firmeza. \\"Precisamos ter certeza de que estamos seguros aqui.\\" Malakai assentiu, levantando-se para acompanhá-la. Erick e Lyanna observaram enquanto os dois desapareciam na penumbra que antecedia a saída da caverna, as sombras dançantes do fogo tornando suas figuras quase etéreas. Arya e Malakai alcançaram a entrada da caverna, onde a luz do luar filtrava-se tenuemente através das nuvens carregadas de neve. Com a katana empunhada, Arya inspecionava cada canto, buscando sinais que denunciassem a presença de mais inimigos ou criaturas noturnas. Malakai tocou o braço de Arya levemente, sentindo o quão fria ela estava apesar de sua postura rígida. \\"Você deveria ter ficado com o manto,\\" ele disse, a preocupação rompendo a barreira de sua indiferença habitual. Arya deu de ombros, sua atenção ainda focada no exterior escuro e ameaçador. \\"Lyanna precisava mais dele,\\" respondeu ela simplesmente, como se o ato de generosidade fosse a coisa mais natural do mundo. \\"Mal os conhece e já está dando suas roupas e comida. Você é idiota ou o que?\\" Malakai provocou, embora o tom de sua voz tivesse traços de admiração. \\"Não é idiotice, Kailus,\\" Arya replicou, a voz firme. \\"É humanidade, algo que talvez você tenha esquecido ao longo dos séculos.\\" Houve um breve silêncio, durante o qual apenas o som suave da neve caindo podia ser ouvido. Malakai olhou para Arya, seus olhos vermelhos brilhando com uma intensidade incomum. “Se eles se tornarem um peso para você, o que você tenha que arriscar sua vida por eles… eu os matarei. Sem nem pensar duas vezes,” ele declarou, a voz destilando uma ameaça fria. Arya manteve o olhar fixo no horizonte noturno, a respiração tornando-se visível em pequenas nuvens de vapor. Por um instante, ela se perguntou se a frieza do imperador demoníaco seria capaz de rivalizar com o gelo que se acumulava ao seu redor. Ela sabia que Malakai não falava em vão, e a promessa de morte era tão real quanto o sangue que corria em suas veias. \\"Não precisará matá-los,\\" Arya disse finalmente, virando-se para enfrentá-lo. \\"Não vou deixar que se tornem um peso. Eu protejo aqueles com quem me importo, não importa o custo.\\" Malakai observou-a, o leve franzir de sua testa indicando uma rara confusão. \\"Eles mal conhecem você, e você mal os conhece. Por que se importa tanto?\\" sua voz era quase um sussurro, como se ele realmente desejasse entender. “EU PRECISO DISSO PARA ME LEMBRAR DE QUE AINDA SOU HUMANA, KAILUS!\\" Arya tapou a boca rapidamente, percebendo a intensidade de sua própria voz. A emoção borbulhava sob sua superfície calma, e o olhar em seus olhos era ardente, entregando a ferida aberta que era a memória do extermínio de seu clã. Tantos anos buscando vingança, matando sem hesitação aqueles que ficavam em seu caminho, Arya começou a sentir o peso de suas ações e a temer que o fio que a ligava à humanidade estivesse se desgastando. A preocupação de se tornar o que ela mais odiava a assombrava, e ajudar Erick e Lyanna oferecia uma tênue esperança de redenção, um antídoto para o veneno da vingança que corria em suas veias. “Ah… agora eu entendi. Não quer aceitar que está se tornando algo como eu.” Malakai inclinou a cabeça ligeiramente, um sorriso irônico tocando seus lábios enquanto observava a samurai. Arya desviou o olhar, focando novamente no vazio para além da entrada da caverna. As palavras dele, embora cruéis, tinham um fio de verdade que ela não podia ignorar. Arya temia a possibilidade de seus métodos e seu coração endurecido a transformarem em uma sombra do demônio que caminhava ao seu lado. \\"Eu nunca serei como você, Kailus,\\" Arya respondeu, a definição em sua voz era como o aço de sua katana. \\"Minhas ações têm propósito, não são caprichos de poder e tédio.\\" Malakai traçou uma unha negra pela linha da mandíbula dela, com um toque que poderia ser tão letal quanto carinhoso. \\"Você se agarra ao seu propósito como uma criança a uma manta, Arya,\\" ele murmurou, cada palavra carregada com um significado que apenas seres como ele poderiam compreender plenamente. \\"Mas eu vejo a verdade nos seus olhos. A batalha que você trava não é apenas contra aqueles que destruíram seu clã. É uma luta contra a escuridão que ameaça engolir sua alma.\\" Arya bateu na mão de Malakai, afastando-a de seu rosto com uma mistura de irritação e vulnerabilidade. “Eu sei muito bem com o que estou lutando,” ela disse, desafiando-o com a força de sua vontade. “Agora vamos voltar. Erick e Lyanna precisam de nós. E Kailus, não entre mais na minha cabeça. Não é seu lugar.” Malakai ergueu uma sobrancelha, o desafio de Arya despertando nele uma fascinação ainda maior pela complexidade humana. “Como quiser, Arya,” ele concedeu, o tom de sua voz misturando diversão e um respeito relutante. Eles retornaram ao calor da caverna, encontrando Erick e Lyanna aconchegados perto do fogo, a exaustão vencendo o medo e a tensão. Arya se sentou silenciosamente, sua katana sempre ao alcance, enquanto Malakai se recostava contra a parede rochosa, observando a interação humana com um olhar distante. Entediado, ele se aproximou da jovem Lyanna, que encolhia-se junto ao fogo, seus olhos arregalados e fixos nas chamas hipnóticas. Malakai observou-a por um momento, a curiosidade pueril de um ser antigo refletida em seus olhos vermelhos. “Quantos anos você tem?” Lyanna levantou os olhos para Malakai, seu olhar ainda carregado de um medo reverencial diante do ser poderoso à sua frente. \\"Eu... eu tenho dezessete anos, Supremo Soberano,\\" ela respondeu, sua voz quase um sussurro, enquanto se esforçava para manter a compostura na presença dele. “Você… não quer se casar com o príncipe, não é?” Lyanna hesitou, a surpresa de ser questionada por uma entidade como Malakai misturada com a súbita oportunidade de desabafar seu coração. Ela olhou para Erik, que dormia ao seu lado, e sentiu uma pontada de culpa ao admitir a verdade diante de estranhos. \\"Eu... Eu nunca desejei isso,\\" ela confessou, baixando os olhos. \\"Foi uma escolha feita para mim, para assegurar a segurança e o futuro da minha vila. Eu mal conheço o príncipe Ivan.\\" “Eu posso ver. Tudo pelo seu pai, Scar, líder da aldeia, e a querida mamãe, Sarah.” Lyanna olhou para Malakai com assombro, perguntando-se como ele poderia saber os nomes de seus pais e os detalhes de sua vida. “Como...?” Uma pedra atingiu a cabeça de Malakai com uma força suficiente para irritar, mas não para ferir. \\"Pare de entrar na mente das pessoas sem permissão,\\" Arya repreendeu, sua expressão um misto de desaprovação e alerta. \\"E pare de assustar Lyanna.\\" Malakai passou a mão por onde a pedra o atingira, um sorriso perverso emergindo em seus lábios. \\"Ah, mas é tão divertido,\\" ele zombou, mas havia um tom de advertência em sua voz. Arya se aproximou e o puxou pela orelha, utilizando o gesto como uma repreensão física à infantilidade do Supremo Soberano. \\"Kailus, controle-se,\\" ela sibilou, sua voz baixa e firme. \\"Não estamos aqui para jogos.\\" Malakai grunhiu levemente, mas o brilho em seus olhos traía sua diversão. \\"Você sempre soube como acabar com a minha diversão, Arya,\\" ele resmungou, afastando-se dela e esfregando a orelha. Erik acordou com um sobressalto, a confusão evidente em seu rosto enquanto ele tentava entender a cena diante dele. A luz do fogo dançava sobre as feições de Arya e Malakai, um contraste bizarro de calor humano e distanciamento sobrenatural. \\"O que aconteceu?\\" Erik perguntou, sua voz ainda rouca do sono e da dor. \\"Tivemos um pequeno... desacordo. Nada com que se preocupar,\\" Arya respondeu rapidamente, lançando um olhar repreensivo em direção a Malakai, que respondeu com um encolher de ombros descuidado. “Por que você o chama de Kailus, Arya?” Lyanna perguntou timidamente, o brilho das chamas refletido em seus olhos ansiosos. Havia uma curiosidade inocente em sua expressão, um desejo de entender a relação entre a feroz samurai e esse ser de poder incomensurável. Arya olhou para Lyanna, percebendo a inocência e a curiosidade pura nos olhos da jovem. Ela hesitou por um momento, ciente de que cada detalhe que compartilhava sobre Malakai aumentava o vínculo entre eles, um vínculo que ela sabia ser perigoso. Mas havia algo na forma como Lyanna perguntou, um anseio por compreender o incompreensível, que fez Arya querer responder. “Kailus foi o nome que ele deu a si mesmo quando o mundo ainda estava em sua infância, uma era de silêncio e de possibilidades infinitas. Ele andou entre as estrelas e viu civilizações nascerem e perecerem. Com o tempo, o peso de ser único em sua habilidade começou a pressioná-lo. Ele precisava de um nome que impusesse respeito e distância, um título que ressoasse com poder e domínio. Assim nasceu Malakai, o Supremo Soberano.” “Arya. Pare.” A voz de Malakai interrompeu o momento, a autoridade em sua fala era indiscutível. Arya fechou a boca, passando um olhar apreensivo para ele. O imperador demoníaco encarava-a com uma intensidade que fazia o ar em volta vibrar com um poder quase palpável. Por um breve segundo, o ambiente da caverna tensionou-se, como se o próprio tempo aguardasse a próxima palavra de Malakai. “Só para deixar claro, se eu ouvir algum de vocês dois chamando-me de Kailus, farei questão de lembrá-los de quem eu sou. Não é um nome para ser usado levianamente ou sem a devida permissão.” Malakai falava com a frieza de uma noite sem estrelas, e seu olhar era inabalável. Contudo, sua postura era de alguém que protegia algo íntimo, algo que só Arya tinha o direito de conhecer. Erik e Lyanna se entreolharam com um misto de medo e entendimento. Não ousariam desafiar a palavra do Supremo Soberano, não quando suas vidas penduravam-se por um fio tão delicado quanto a paciência de Malakai. A caverna estava agora em silêncio, exceto pelo crepitar do fogo e pelo som abafado do vento lá fora. Cada um voltou-se para seus próprios pensamentos, refletindo sobre a estranha trégua entre a luz e a escuridão que se formara entre Arya e Malakai. A barriga de Lyanna começou a roncar, rompendo a quietude da caverna com um som humano demasiado comum. O constrangimento tingiu suas faces, e ela envolveu os braços em torno do estômago, como se pudesse silenciar a fome que revelava sua vulnerabilidade. “Eu vou caçar.” Arya levantou-se abruptamente, percebendo a necessidade imediata. Ela pegou a katana e dirigiu-se à entrada da caverna. Malakai olhou para ela, um traço de desaprovação em seu rosto. “Não precisa se incomodar com isso. Posso simplesmente criar o que precisam.” Arya parou, virando-se para encará-lo. “Não. Eles precisam de algo real, algo tangível. Não de magia ou ilusões.” Malakai suspirou, levantando-se com uma elegância preguiçosa. Ele abriu um pequeno portal negro, de onde dois coelhos saltaram para a caverna, assustados, mas ilesos. Um brilho de magia negra ainda circulava-os por um segundo antes de se dissipar completamente, revelando a autenticidade de suas formas. “Não é ilusão,” Malakai afirmou, um traço de desafio em sua voz. “São reais, tão reais quanto qualquer criatura que corre por essas florestas.” Arya olhou para os coelhos, a desconfiança ainda marcada em seu rosto, mas a necessidade de alimentar seus companheiros temporários falava mais alto. Ela suspirou, seu orgulho cedendo à praticidade da situação. \\"Está bem,\\" ela disse, sua voz baixa, mas não sem um toque de gratidão relutante. Erick, agora desperto e atento, olhou com surpresa para os animais que surgiram do nada. Lyanna, ainda com as bochechas coradas de constrangimento, sorriu com a perspectiva de uma refeição quente. Malakai, satisfeito por ter ajudado, apesar da teimosia de Arya, não conseguiu evitar um sorriso arrogante. \\"Eu vou prepará-los para cozinhar,\\" Arya proclamou, levantando-se para pegar os coelhos. Ela lançou um olhar significativo para Malakai, que apenas deu de ombros, fingindo desinteresse enquanto observava a samurai trabalhar. Com movimentos habilidosos e precisos, Arya limpou e preparou os coelhos para a fogueira. O calor do fogo logo foi substituído pelo cheiro tentador de carne cozinhando, e mesmo a tensão que antes permeava a caverna pareceu se dissolver um pouco sob a promessa de uma refeição substancial. Enquanto a carne sibilava e dourava sobre as chamas, Arya sentou-se, cruzando as pernas e observando a comida com um olhar atento. Malakai, incapaz de resistir à oportunidade de provocar, aproximou-se dela, sentando-se um pouco mais perto do que o necessário. Malakai inclinou-se em direção a Arya, seus ombros quase se tocando, e Arya sentiu o calor que emanava dele contrastar com o frio da caverna. “Cheiro bom…” Malakai respirou fundo, o aroma da carne assando preenchendo o espaço estreito da caverna. Arya manteve-se focada na fogueira, mas podia sentir a presença dominadora de Malakai tão perto, uma presença que trazia tanto conforto quanto perigo. \\"E o que você sabe sobre cheiros bons? Não me parece que comer seja uma necessidade para você,\\" Arya provocou, mantendo sua voz neutra, mas não suficientemente para esconder a curiosidade. “Eu não estava me referindo a carne.” Ele se aproximou do pescoço de Arya, respirando o aroma peculiar que vinha de sua pele. \\"Eu estava falando de algo bem mais... atraente.\\" Malakai lambeu a linha de seu pescoço delicadamente, provocando um arrepio que correu pela espinha de Arya, apesar de sua determinação de não demonstrar fraqueza diante dele. O gesto íntimo era um lembrete de sua natureza predatória e da tensão sempre presente entre eles. Aproximando-se ainda mais, Malakai sussurrou em seu ouvido, com uma voz que misturava promessa e perigo. \\"Sua determinação e força tornam você irresistível, Arya. Não é de admirar que eu não consiga ficar longe.\\" Arya pegou um graveto próximo e o quebrou na cabeça de Malakai, uma reprimenda clara e física à sua provocação audaciosa. Malakai recuou, um sorriso ainda brincando nos cantos de seus lábios. A irritação de Arya não era novidade para ele, mas cada reação dela só servia para aumentar o seu fascínio pela samurai humana. “Você realmente precisa aprender a controlar esse seu temperamento,” Malakai comentou, esfregando o local onde o graveto atingira. Seu tom era brincalhão, mas havia uma provocação subjacente. “Idiota.” Arya resmungou, sem se virar para olhá-lo. \\"Apenas certifique-se de que não se aproxime novamente assim. Não estou brincando, Malakai.\\" A carne estava agora pronta, e o cheiro agradável preenchia a caverna, oferecendo um consolo bem-vindo. Arya retirou os coelhos da fogueira com cuidado, colocando-os em um prato improvisado feito de folhas grandes que ela havia coletado. Erick e Lyanna observavam, as expressões de fome em seus rostos substituídas por olhares de agradecimento. “Sirva-se” Arya disse, estendendo o prato em direção a Lyanna e Erick. \\"Comam enquanto está quente.\\" Erick pegou um pedaço, sorrindo para Arya em agradecimento. Ainda enfraquecido, ele tomou um cuidado extra para não fazer movimentos bruscos que pudessem irritar suas feridas. Lyanna, mais reservada, mas claramente aliviada, aceitou sua parte com um gesto de cabeça grato. Enquanto comiam, Arya se afastou ligeiramente, mantendo uma distância respeitosa para dar-lhes algum espaço. Malakai a segui, sentando-se ao lado dela com uma familiaridade que desafiava sua natureza enigmática. “Também estou com fome, sabia?” Ele disse, com um toque de teatralidade na voz. Arya virou-se para ele, os olhos estreitando-se enquanto ela avaliava se ele estava falando sério. \\"Você não come esse tipo de comida,\\" Arya respondeu, com uma ponta de sarcasmo. \\"Você só se alimenta de… Não. De modo algum.” Droga. Ele estava com fome de sangue. “Kailus, não a—” Ele tapou a boca de Arya rapidamente com a mão, seus olhos vermelhos agora ardendo com uma intensidade feroz que não deixava margem para argumentos. “Só um pouquinho, Arya. Eles não vão nem notar,\\" ele sussurrou, sua voz um misto de sedução e ameaça. A mão de Malakai ainda cobria a boca de Arya, impedindo qualquer som de escapar. Seus olhos encontraram os dela, o fogo refletindo neles, criando um jogo de luz e sombras que parecia dançar com a tensão do momento. O olhar de Malakai era um redemoinho de desejo e impulso primitivo, mas mesmo nas profundezas daquele abismo vermelho, uma faísca de hesitação brilhava. Arya, cujo coração batia com a força de um tambor de guerra, conhecia aquele olhar muito bem. Era o mesmo olhar que a acompanhava desde o dia em que encontrou o imperador caído na estrada, o mesmo olhar que carregava a dualidade de seu ser: o poder supremo e a solidão infinita. “Espere eles dormirem, e eu te darei o necessário.” A voz de Arya era um sussurro, uma promessa sibilada que carregava o peso de sua própria resolução. Ela conhecia o risco que estava assumindo, mas também entendia o delicado equilíbrio de poder entre eles. Malakai retirou a mão de sua boca lentamente, o contato de seus dedos deixando um rastro de calor na pele de Arya. Ele assentiu uma vez, reconhecendo a concessão dela e a confiança implícita que isso representava. “Certo. Eu vou esperar,” Malakai concordou, recuando para permitir que Arya respirasse mais livremente. Seu olhar ainda permanecia nela, uma chama de gratidão e algo mais indefinível ardia em seus olhos. Com um gesto de cabeça, ele se afastou e começou a caminhar em direção à outra extremidade da caverna, mas não sem antes lançar um olhar sobre o ombro, um sorriso quase imperceptível tocando seus lábios. Arya observou Malakai se afastar, sentindo uma mistura de alívio e apreensão agitar-se em seu peito. Ela se virou para Erick e Lyanna, que agora estavam satisfeitos e sonolentos pelo calor do fogo e pela refeição que tinham acabado de compartilhar. “Vocês devem descansar,” aconselhou Arya suavemente. “Nós temos um longo caminho pela frente amanhã.” Erick assentiu com a cabeça, agradecendo outra vez com um olhar sincero. “Não sei como poderemos agradecer por tudo que vocês estão fazendo por nós,” ele disse, sua voz cheia de gratidão. Erick concordou, suas pálpebras agora pesadas pelo cansaço. Lyanna já havia se aconchegado mais perto do fogo, deixando-se levar pelo abraço acolhedor do sono. Com sua respiração se tornando mais lenta e profunda, o casal logo sucumbiu ao descanso merecido, deixando Arya e Malakai em vigília. Arya se levantou silenciosamente, caminhando até a entrada da caverna para mais uma vez verificar o perímetro. Ela podia sentir a presença de Malakai atrás dela, a quietude dele um contraste com a voracidade que sabia estar espreitando logo abaixo da superfície calma. \\"Por que me olha tanto?” A voz de Arya quebrou o silêncio, carregada de leves notas de desafio e curiosidade. Ela não se virou para encarar Malakai, mas pôde sentir a intensidade do olhar dele em suas costas, uma presença quase física. “Eles dormiram.” A voz de Malakai parecia vir de todos os lados, uma reverberação que preenchia a caverna com uma promessa silenciosa. Arya sabia o que aquilo significava. Ela suspirou, a determinação endurecendo suas feições sob a luz fria da lua que se infiltrava pela entrada da caverna. Girando nos calcanhares, ela encarou Malakai, os olhos amarelos brilhando com uma luz própria, um farol no escuro que desafiava a escuridão à sua frente. “Está na hora,” ela disse, a voz baixa, mas firme, carregada com a aceitação de seu acordo. Malakai aproximou-se, o ar ao seu redor vibrando com uma energia que parecia alterar a própria gravidade do lugar. Assumindo uma postura desafiadora, Arya esperou, pronta para cumprir sua palavra, mas também alerta para qualquer sinal de excesso por parte de Malakai. O Supremo Soberano observou-a por um momento, medindo-a não apenas com os olhos, mas com todos os sentidos, percebendo cada batida acelerada de seu coração, cada respiração contida. Então, com uma suavidade que contrastava com a violência que muitas vezes acompanhava sua natureza, ele aproximou-se ainda mais, um dos seus braços rodeando a cintura de Arya para trazê-la para perto. Com a outra mão, ele afastou delicadamente os cabelos negros de seu pescoço, expondo a pele pálida à Lua e ao desejo que ele mal conseguia conter. “Deliciosa…” Ele a empurrou para trás de uma parede que estava a poucos passos de distância, seus olhos vermelhos fixos nos dela com uma intensidade que parecia atravessar a própria alma. Arya, embora firme, não pôde evitar a onda de incerteza que a invadiu. Malakai era um ser de poder incomensurável, e ela, apesar de destemida, ainda era mortal. Malakai inclinou-se, sua respiração quente contra a pele fria de Arya, fazendo com que ela se arrepiasse involuntariamente. Ela fechou os olhos, preparando-se para a sensação de seus caninos perfurando a pele. “Ah!” A dor aguda foi rápida, mas mais intensa do que Arya esperava. Malakai sentiu o sangue quente de Arya fluir para sua boca, um gosto que era ao mesmo tempo uma indulgência e um lembrete de sua eterna maldição. Arya, com seus olhos ainda fechados, sentiu as forças fugindo rapidamente, mas confiava em Malakai, ou talvez confiasse em sua própria capacidade de pará-lo se ele fosse longe demais. Ela podia sentir a mão dele firme em sua cintura, não apenas como um ato possessivo, mas também como um suporte, como se ele reconhecesse a necessidade de mantê-la de pé enquanto tomava o que precisava para saciar sua fome ancestral. Através do contato, um entendimento silencioso era compartilhado entre eles; um pacto que não precisava de palavras para ser selado. A medida que Malakai bebia, o mundo de Arya começou a girar, as paredes da caverna se fundindo em uma espiral de cores e sombras. Ela soube, com a clareza que antecede a inconsciência, que ele se detinha na beira do que seria demais, calculando cada gole com uma precisão que desmentia seu comportamento usualmente desdenhoso. “Kailus… chega.” Malakai parou imediatamente ao ouvir a voz enfraquecida de Arya, a urgência em sua palavra de comando ecoando na escuridão da caverna como um sino de advertência. Ele se afastou, um filete de sangue ainda escorrendo pelo canto de sua boca, seus olhos vermelhos refletindo uma mistura de satisfação e preocupação. Ele a pegou nos braços antes que ela pudesse desabar, a força em seu corpo dissipada pelo gesto íntimo que haviam compartilhado. A respiração de Arya era superficial e irregular, mas ela estava consciente, seus olhos amarelos brilhando com uma luz fraca que ainda detinha o poder de seu espírito indomável. “Você está bem?” Malakai perguntou, a preocupação em sua voz um contraste com o tom autoritário que normalmente usava. Arya assentiu levemente, tentando reunir sua força. “Sim, apenas... fraca. Dê-me um momento.” Sua voz era um sussurro, mas ainda assim carregado com a firmeza que a caracterizava. Malakai a levou de volta ao calor reconfortante da fogueira, depositando-a suavemente no chão. A luz das chamas iluminava seu rosto, destacando a palidez que tomara conta de sua pele. Ele observou enquanto a respiração de Arya se tornava mais regular, os sinais de recuperação começando a aparecer. Com o rosto de Arya banhado pelo brilho da fogueira, Malakai observou-a com uma intensidade incomum, a preocupação evidente em seu semblante. Não era comum para o Supremo Soberano sentir algo tão próximo da ansiedade, mas Arya não era uma presença comum em sua existência infinita. Arya, por sua vez, lutava para manter os olhos abertos, a fraqueza em seu corpo uma sensação estranha e perturbadora. \\"Eu preciso... de água,\\" ela murmurou, a garganta seca e a língua áspera após o contato com a fome voraz de Malakai. Sem hesitar, Malakai moveu-se com uma velocidade que desafiava a percepção humana, retornando momentos depois com um cantil de água fresca. Ele ergueu a cabeça de Arya delicadamente, apoiando-a contra seu joelho enquanto levava o cantil aos seus lábios. \\"Beba lentamente,\\" ele instruiu, sua voz baixa e calmante, um tom raramente utilizado. A água fria desceu pela garganta de Arya como uma bênção, cada gole trazendo um pouco mais de vida à sua expressão cansada. A luz do fogo dançava em seu rosto, lançando um brilho sobre as linhas determinadas de sua mandíbula. Ela devolveu o cantil a Malakai com um aceno de cabeça agradecido, seus olhos encontrando os dele por um momento e reconhecendo um lampejo de... seria preocupação? Malakai parecia prestes a dizer algo, sua postura rígida e a forma como ele desviava o olhar do dela eram incomuns. Ele estava acostumado a olhar para o mundo e suas criaturas com indiferença ou desdém, mas com Arya, as coisas eram diferentes. “Você nunca demonstrou preocupação assim antes,” Arya observou, a voz ainda fraca, mas sua mente clara como cristal. “Isso me faz pensar se você está começando a se sentir... humano.” O Supremo Soberano soltou uma risada seca. “Humano? Eu? Não seja ridícula, Arya. Eu apenas... reconheço a vantagem de ter você ao meu lado.” Ele se afastou um pouco, desconfortável com a direção da conversa. Pelo que parece, Arya havia desmaiado pois acordou com a luz do amanhecer lhe beijando o rosto, e uma capa pesada a cobrindo – com certeza, trabalho de Malakai. Sua cabeça ainda girava um pouco, mas ela sentia-se bem melhor agora que o descanso havia permitido a seu corpo começar a se recuperar da perda de sangue. Lyanna e Erik já estavam acordados, arrumando suas coisas. “Por que não me acordaram?” Arya perguntou, sua voz ainda carregando um traço da fadiga do dia anterior. “Você parecia estar precisando do descanso,” respondeu Erik com um sorriso gentil, mas preocupado. “Além disso… o Supremo Soberano disse que arrancaria nossas mãos se tentássemos acordá-la,\\" terminou ele, lançando um olhar nervoso na direção onde Malakai havia se recolhido na sombra de uma formação rochosa. “Ah… esse idiota.” Arya se sentou, afastando a capa pesada que Malakai havia colocado sobre ela durante a noite. Ela esticou os membros dormentes, sentindo o formigamento desconfortável que percorria seus braços e pernas à medida que circulação retornava ao normal. Olhando ao redor, ela viu Malakai afastado, sua figura imponente recortada contra o nascer do sol que banhava a entrada da caverna com tons de laranja e vermelho. “Malakai,” Arya chamou, sua voz mais firme agora que ela havia recuperado parte de sua energia. Ela se aproximou dele, cada passo marcado por uma determinação que compensava o desconforto que ainda sentia. “Vamos. Nós chegaremos em Askov em três dias se mantivermos um bom ritmo,” Ela disse, esperando que ele se levantasse e se juntasse a eles. Malakai apenas olhou para ela, a luz do amanhecer refletindo nos seus olhos escarlate, dando-lhes um brilho quase sobrenatural. “Três dias, huh?” Malakai finalmente se levantou, a capa negra que usava ondulando com o movimento. “Muito bem, mas espero que não esteja planejando fazer mais paradas heroicas pelo caminho.” Quando sairam da caverna, a neve havia parado e a grama sob seus pés estava coberta por uma fina camada de gelo. O ar frio da manhã parecia mais suportável agora que o sol começava a escalar o céu, prometendo um dia mais claro do que o anterior. Erik e Lyanna seguiam à frente, o rapaz ainda caminhando com dificuldade devido aos ferimentos, mas determinado a não atrasar o grupo. Lyanna, por sua vez, mantinha-se perto de Erik, oferecendo apoio sempre que ele vacilava. “Eu ainda não entrei na sua mente, jovem Erik.” A voz de Malakai surgiu repentinamente, rompendo o silêncio que havia se instalado entre o grupo durante a caminhada matinal. As palavras, ditas de forma casual, congelaram Erik em seu lugar, fazendo-o virar-se para encarar o Supremo Soberano com uma mistura de confusão e alarme. Erik permaneceu imóvel, sua respiração acelerada e seus olhos fixos em Malakai, tentando entender o significado por trás de suas palavras. Focado em Erik, Malakai captou tudo: A aldeia, sua esposa Celeste, o filhinho de apenas um ano que tinha deixado para trás, a ordem do líder de escoltar Lyanna, a sensação de falha ao não conseguir protegê-la dos mercenários, a dor das feridas que ainda latejavam em seu corpo. Foi uma leitura rápida, mas profunda, um mergulho nos medos e esperanças de Erik. Erik levou a mão ao nariz de repente, sentindo o sangue quente e espesso correr por entre seus dedos. Ele cambaleou, surpreendido pela invasão súbita de Malakai em sua mente, uma violação que o deixou desnorteado e vulnerável. Arya, com uma destreza que desmentia seu estado ainda fragilizado, rapidamente agarrou Malakai pelos cabelos prateados, puxando-o com força para trás. A surpresa de Malakai foi evidente; ele não esperava uma reação tão física de Arya, especialmente depois do que havia acontecido entre eles na noite anterior. “O que pensa que está fazendo?” Arya vociferou, a raiva feroz em sua voz fazendo com que até mesmo o Supremo Soberano hesitasse. “Prometi protegê-los, e não permitirei que brinque com a mente de alguém da minha proteção.” Malakai olhou para Arya, sua surpresa inicial dando lugar a um sorriso arrogante que desafiava a fúria em seus olhos amarelos. \\"Eu estava apenas curioso,\\" ele respondeu, sua voz contendo um traço de diversão que só serviu para inflamar ainda mais a ira de Arya. “Curiosidade não lhe dá o direito de invadir a mente alheia. Erik é um humano, não um brinquedo para sua diversão!” Arya manteve a mão firme nos cabelos de Malakai, pronta para puxá-lo novamente se ele mostrasse qualquer sinal de resistência. Erik, ainda segurando o nariz ensanguentado, olhou para Arya com uma mistura de gratidão e temor. A samurai não apenas havia salvado sua vida e de Lyanna, mas agora também os defendia do ser mais temido e poderoso que conheciam. “Eu entendo a sua proteção para com eles, Arya, mas não precisa ser tão... física,” Malakai disse, tentando recuperar sua postura habitual de indiferença. “Argh! Estou indo embora por enquanto.” Malakai se afastou com um movimento fluido e arrogante, a irritação em seu rosto tão evidente quanto a neve que ainda cobria o chão. Com um olhar irritado para Arya, ele desapareceu em um vórtice escuro que se fechou com um suspiro silencioso, deixando para trás apenas o frio que acompanhava sua magia. Arya soltou o ar que não sabia que estava segurando, seus olhos ainda fixos no espaço onde Malakai havia estado. Ela relaxou ligeiramente, mas a tensão em seus ombros não desapareceu completamente. \\"Ele vai voltar,\\" ela murmurou mais para si mesma do que para Erik ou Lyanna. \\"Ele sempre volta.\\" Há noite, eles tinham apenas 3 grãos de nozes para comerem. Arya olhou para os três grãos de nozes nas palmas de suas mãos, sentindo a ironia amarga de suas escassas provisões contra a vastidão da natureza ao seu redor. Erik e Lyanna, sentados do outro lado da fogueira, compartilhavam um olhar silencioso, suas expressões tensas revelando a preocupação sobre o que os aguardava na jornada seguinte. “Vamos dividir esses,” Arya disse, quebrando a quietude que havia se instalado. Ela estendeu um grão para cada um, mantendo o último para si. \\"Não é muito, mas manterá nossa força até encontrarmos mais comida.\\" “Se o Supremo Soberano estivesse aqui, ele poderia fazer comida para nós,\\" Lyanna murmurou, sua voz trêmula de fome e exaustão. Erik olhou para Arya antes de aceitar o grão de noz oferecido. \\"Não podemos depender dele para tudo. Arya já fez mais do que qualquer um poderia esperar.\\" Arya acenou com a cabeça em concordância e mastigou seu grão de noz devagar, tentando extrair cada última gota de energia que ele poderia oferecer. A luz da fogueira dançava em seus olhos, refletindo a determinação que ardiam dentro dela, uma chama que não seria extinta pela fome ou pelo frio. \\"Vou caçar,\\" Arya declarou de repente, levantando-se com uma agilidade que desmentia a fadiga que sentia. \\"Fiquem aqui e mantenham o fogo aceso. Eu voltarei em breve.\\" Erik e Lyanna acenaram, compreendendo a necessidade da ação de Arya. Ela se afastou da luz do fogo, desaparecendo na escuridão da floresta como uma sombra em busca de esperança. Arya avançava pela floresta escura, a neve abaixo de seus pés mascarando qualquer som que suas passadas pudessem produzir. A lua, um fino crescente no céu, oferecia pouca luz, deixando a samurai confiar mais em seu instinto do que em sua visão. Enquanto se movia com cuidado entre as árvores, seus olhos vasculhavam a escuridão em busca de qualquer sinal de vida. Ela sabia que a caça seria escassa, mas a fome que apertava seu estômago não deixava espaço para dúvidas ou hesitações. Cada movimento era calculado, cada respiração controlada, cada sentido em alerta máximo. Foi então que aconteceu. Um passo em falso, uma superfície instável sob a neve e, de repente, Arya sentiu seu pé afundar inesperadamente no que parecia ser um buraco oculto pela camada branca. A sensação de torção foi imediata, uma dor aguda irradiando por seu tornozelo. Um grunhido de dor escapou por entre seus dentes cerrados enquanto ela caía de joelhos na neve. Ela apertou o local ferido, a respiração se tornando mais rápida conforme lutava contra o pico de sofrimento. A adrenalina ainda pulsava em suas veias, mantendo a dor em um nível gerenciável, mas Arya sabia que isso não duraria muito. Então, um lobo branco GIGANTE surgiu do meio das sombras da floresta, seus olhos brilhantes como dois rubis refletindo a luz da lua. O lobo observava Arya com uma curiosidade predatória, a cabeça inclinada de lado enquanto avaliava a presa ferida diante de si. Arya congelou, seus olhos arregalados, fixos no lobo branco gigante que emergira das sombras. A voz que saiu do lobo era inesperadamente suave e profunda, vibrando com uma familiaridade que a confundia e aliviava ao mesmo tempo. \\"Isso parece estar doendo, Arya,\\" disse o lobo, sua fala clara e articulada de uma forma que nenhum animal normal poderia conseguir. A samurai ficou boquiaberta, a dor em seu tornozelo temporariamente esquecida diante da visão e da voz do lobo. \\"Malakai?\\" ela arriscou, a suspeita nascendo em sua mente enquanto observava os olhos rubi do lobo, tão semelhantes aos de Malakai. O lobo gigante sentou-se na neve, um sorriso quase humano brincando em seus lábios lupinos. \\"Você me conhece tão bem, Arya. Sim, sou eu. Achei que essa forma seria apropriada para uma caçada noturna,\\" Malakai disse, sua cauda branca varrendo a neve de maneira pensativa. Arya observou o lobo gigante, um misto de frustração e admiração marcando sua expressão enquanto tentava processar a transformação de Malakai. \\"Você pode mudar de forma agora?\\" ela perguntou, tentando manter a voz firme apesar da onda de dor que emanava de seu tornozelo. Malakai, ainda na forma de lobo, inclinou a cabeça em um gesto que evidenciava seu orgulho. \\"Eu sou o Supremo Soberano. Não há limites para o que posso fazer,\\" ele respondeu, a voz ecoando com uma autoridade sobrenatural. \\"Então, o Supremo Soberano vai me ajudar a voltar para o acampamento?\\" Arya retrucou, a dor começando a fazer sua paciência se esvair. \\"Hmm... depende. Vai me obrigar a pedir desculpas para aquele humano novamente?\\" Malakai perguntou, erguendo uma sobrancelha peluda. Arya bufou, a dor em seu tornozelo tornando-a menos tolerante com as brincadeiras de Malakai. \\"Esqueça as desculpas, apenas me ajude a levantar,\\" ela resmungou. O enorme lobo branco então se aproximou e, com um cuidado que contradizia seu tamanho e natureza selvagem, abaixou-se ao lado de Arya. \\"Suba nas minhas costas,\\" ele instruiu, mantendo-se agachado para que ela pudesse alcançar. Com um suspiro de resignação misturado com alívio, Arya usou o que restava de sua força para se posicionar nas costas do lobo. Malakai então se levantou lentamente, garantindo que Arya estivesse segura antes de começar a caminhar de volta ao acampamento. A caminhada de volta ao acampamento foi silenciosa, apenas o som dos passos do lobo gigante na neve quebrando o silêncio da noite. Arya, segurando-se firmemente na densa pelagem branca, sentia cada movimento do corpo poderoso e ágil de Malakai sob ela, uma mistura reconfortante de força e controle. A lua iluminava o caminho de volta, lançando um brilho prateado sobre a floresta, transformando o mundo à sua volta em uma paisagem de sombras e luz. “Vou correr um pouquinho…” Malakai acelerou, seus músculos ondulando poderosamente sob Arya enquanto ele se lançava pela floresta com uma velocidade surpreendente. Os ramos passavam por eles em um borrão, e Arya se agarrava à pelagem do lobo, o ar frio cortando seu rosto enquanto eles avançavam pela noite. “Kailus!” A velocidade com que se moviam era vertiginosa, e Arya mal conseguia manter os olhos abertos contra o vento gelado que batia contra seu rosto. Entre o cansaço e a adrenalina que corria por suas veias, ela sentia a dor em seu tornozelo diminuir, tornando-se uma mera memória distante enquanto confiava completamente em Malakai para levá-la em segurança. Finalmente, o lobo gigante desacelerou, aproximando-se do acampamento com uma elegância que desafiava seu tamanho. A fogueira, reduzida agora a brasas cintilantes, projetava uma luz suave e reconfortante. Malakai se abaixou mais uma vez, permitindo que Arya deslizasse para o chão com cuidado, apoiando-se em uma árvore próxima para não colocar peso sobre o tornozelo lesionado. Erik e Lyanna, ao verem Arya retornar montada em um lobo branco gigante, ficaram boquiabertos, suas expressões misturando choque, admiração e um vislumbre de medo. A cena parecia ter sido arrancada das páginas de uma antiga lenda, trazendo à vida um ser que eles só conheciam por meio de mitos e sussurros na escuridão da noite. Com as brasas da fogueira como testemunhas, a transformação de Malakai ocorreu em um turbilhão de sombras e luz. O lobo gigante se contorceu e cresceu, sua forma canina se dissolvendo até que o Supremo Soberano estava novamente diante deles em sua forma humana, com um sorriso arrogante pendurado nos lábios. Erik e Lyanna recuaram instintivamente, ainda não acostumados à ideia de estarem tão próximos de um ser de poder tão ilimitado. Malakai, no entanto, pareceu não notar ou não se importar com a reação deles. Seu foco estava em Arya, que apoiava-se na árvore com uma mistura de alívio e desconforto evidente em sua postura. \\"Você poderia ter avisado que ia se transformar tão... dramaticamente,\\" Arya resmungou, olhando para Malakai com uma sobrancelha arqueada. “E perder a chance de ver as caras deles? Jamais,” Malakai respondeu, fazendo um gesto vago em direção a Erik e Lyanna. “Além do mais, você deveria estar mais preocupada com esse tornozelo.” A verdade nas palavras de Malakai penetrou a irritação de Arya, e ela olhou para o tornozelo, que agora começava a inchar visivelmente. \\"Pode consertar isso com sua magia?\\" ela perguntou, o tom prático ocultando a dor que começava a latejar com mais força. Malakai caminhou até Arya, agachando-se diante dela e inspecionando o tornozelo com olhos críticos. \\"Eu posso fazer isso,\\" ele disse, e antes que Arya pudesse oferecer qualquer tipo de protesto, ele tocou o local ferido. Uma onda de calor irradiou do ponto de contato, uma energia que parecia tecer os tecidos danificados de volta à integridade. Arya sentiu o inchaço diminuir, a dor recuando como a maré, deixando para trás apenas a sensação de um membro recém restaurado. Ela olhou para Malakai com um olhar complexo, mesclando surpresa e gratidão. Malakai se levantou, limpando as mãos de maneira teatral enquanto observava Arya testar o peso em seu tornozelo recém-curado. O fogo das brasas refletia em seus olhos vermelhos, concedendo-lhe uma expressão quase pensativa. “Sabe, Arya,” começou Malakai, o sorriso travesso desaparecendo de seus lábios, “estou um tanto cansado de brincar de aventureiro.” Seu olhar varreu o acampamento improvisado, pousando brevemente sobre Erik e Lyanna que o observavam com uma mistura de medo e fascinação. “Este conto tem sido divertido, mas acho que é hora de levar vocês ao seu destino final.” Malakai levantou a mão e, com um gesto fluido, começou a traçar linhas intricadas no ar que brilhavam com uma luz escura e pulsante. A energia se condensava, distorcendo a realidade ao redor até que um portal começou a se formar, seus contornos se firmaram em um arco perfeito que prometia uma passagem imediata para qualquer destino. Arya observou, seu coração acelerado pela antecipação e pelo súbito desejo de terminar a jornada que havia começado com tanto sacrifício. Porém, um sentimento de relutância a impedia de dar um passo à frente. Ela sabia que, apesar da conveniência, havia lições e desafios no caminho que ainda precisavam ser enfrentados. \\"Não,\\" Arya disse, sua voz resoluta cortando o silêncio que havia se estabelecido. Ela se voltou para Malakai, seus olhos amarelos firmes e inabaláveis. \\"Nós vamos completar essa jornada da maneira humana. Sem truques, sem atalhos.\\" Malakai arqueou uma sobrancelha, surpreso pela recusa de Arya. \\"E por que isso, Arya? Por que escolher o caminho mais difícil quando tenho o poder de tornar tudo mais fácil para vocês?\\" “Por EU não quero admitir que preciso da sua ajuda para tudo!”","completion":"Arya se explicou, uma ponta de desafio em sua voz que ecoou na clareira. \\"Além disso, há valor na jornada, nas lutas que enfrentamos e nas lições que aprendemos com elas. Não quero que meus atos sejam produtos de sua magia. Eles devem ser meus, conquistados com esforço e determinação.\\" Malakai observou-a por um momento, a complexidade humana sempre o intrigando, apesar de sua eternidade. \\"Muito bem,\\" ele concedeu, fazendo com que o portal que havia começado a formar se dissipasse em um redemoinho de sombras. \\"Então prossigamos como você desejar, Arya. Mas lembre-se, estarei observando, pronto para intervir se julgar necessário.\\" Arya assentiu, sabendo que essa era a melhor garantia que conseguiria de Malakai. Ela voltou-se para Erik e Lyanna, que durante todo o interlúdio haviam permanecido em silêncio, observando a interação entre a samurai e o ser sobrenatural com fascinação e medo. \\"Vamos continuar,\\" Arya disse a eles, sua voz carregada de uma nova determinação. \\"Askov ainda está à nossa espera, e temos um longo caminho pela frente.\\" A jornada recomeçou ao amanhecer. Com Malakai escoltando à distância, em uma forma que ele preferiu não revelar, o grupo prosseguiu, suas sombras se estendendo sobre a terra coberta de geada. A estrada para Askov foi árdua, com perigos tanto naturais quanto causados pelo homem. Arya, com a lição de Malakai em seu coração, enfrentou cada desafio com uma mistura de sabedoria e coragem, sua katana cortando tanto a dúvida quanto os inimigos que se interpunham em seu caminho. Eventualmente, à medida que se aproximavam de Askov, as dificuldades da jornada deram lugar a uma paisagem de possibilidades e promessas. Arya percebeu que, em algum lugar ao longo do caminho, a presença de Malakai havia se tornado menos uma sombra e mais um farol – uma força que não apenas a seguia, mas também a guiava. Ao alcançarem os portões de Askov, um sentimento de realização permeou o grupo. Não havia portal mágico ou atalho que pudesse proporcionar o mesmo sentido de conquista que eles sentiam naquele momento. Erik e Lyanna agradeceram a Arya e Malakai, suas palavras carregadas de uma gratidão que ia além das palavras e tocava o cerne de sua humanidade. Arya, por sua vez, olhou para Malakai, percebendo pela primeira vez que, apesar da imortalidade e do poder do imperador demoníaco, havia algo essencialmente humano em sua eterna busca por entendimento. \\"Obrigada, Malakai,\\" Arya disse, estendendo a mão em um gesto de amizade e respeito. Malakai olhou para a mão estendida de Arya, uma expressão indecifrável em seu rosto. Então, com um sorriso enigmático, ele aceitou seu gesto. \\"Até a próxima, Arya. Até nossa próxima história.\\" Com o aceno final de Malakai, a samurai e o imperador demoníaco se separaram, cada um seguindo seu próprio caminho, mas levando consigo as memórias de uma jornada compartilhada. O horizonte à frente prometia novos desafios e aventuras, mas também a certeza de que, não importa quão difícil o caminho, a força para superá-lo reside na união da determinação humana com os mistérios imortais do universo."},{"prompt":"ماهي نظرية الوجود لإبن سينا مع ذكر المصادر","completion":"نظرية الوجود عند ابن سينا هي جزء مهم من فلسفته الميتافيزيقية، وقد حاول من خلالها تقديم فهم معمق لمفهوم الوجود وعلاقاته بالعقل والواقع. ابن سينا، أحد أعظم الفلاسفة المسلمين، يعتبَر مفكرًا شاملاً غطت كتاباته جميع ميادين المعرفة المتاحة في عصره، من الطب إلى علم النفس ومن الرياضيات إلى الفلسفة. تركز نظرية الوجود لابن سينا على الفصل بين جوهر الأشياء ووجودها، إذ يرى أن الوجود ليس جزءًا من جوهر الشيء بل هو إضافة خارجية له. وحسب ابن سينا، الوجود ليس صفة أو خاصية يُمكن أن تُنسب إلى الجوهر لتحدده، بل هو حالة تتحقق للجوهر. هذا يعني أن الجوهر يُمكن أن يُفكر فيه بمعزل عن إدراكه كشيء موجود حقًا في الواقع. يقسم ابن سينا الوجود إلى عدة درجات وأنواع، منها الوجود الضروري والوجود الممكن. الوجود الضروري هو ما لا يمكن تصوّر عدمه، وهو ينطبق على الله في فلسفته، الذي هو موجود بذاته ومنه تنبثق كل الوجودات. أما الوجود الممكن، فهو ما يمكن تصور وجوده وعدمه على حد سواء، وينطبق على كل ما عدا الله من المخلوقات. إحدى النقاط المهمة في فلسفة ابن سينا هي تأكيده على وحدانية الوجود وترابط كل الوجودات في نظام محكم يعود في نهاية المطاف إلى الوجود الضروري، الذي هو مصدر كل الوجود والنظام في الكون. المصادر الموثوقة التي تتحدث عن فلسفة ابن سينا ونظرية الوجود تتضمن ترجمات وشروحات لأعماله الرئيسة مثل \\"الشفاء\\" و\\"النجاة\\"، وكذلك الدراسات والأبحاث الأكاديمية التي تُناقش فلسفته وأثرها في الفكر الإسلامي والفلسفة العالمية. من الضروري الرجوع إلى هذه المصادر للحصول على فهم معمق ودقيق لنظرية الوجود لدى ابن سينا وأبعادها الفلسفية."},{"prompt":"name the books","completion":"To explore Ibn Sina's (Avicenna) concept of existence in depth, you might want to delve into some of his major works as well as scholarly analyses of his philosophy.

The section on metaphysics is particularly relevant for understanding his theory of existence. 2. **Al-Najat (The Salvation)**: This is a concise version of Al-Shifa, focusing on similar themes but more accessible for those new to Ibn Sina's philosophy. It provides a clear overview of his metaphysical and existential views. 3. **Isharat wa Tanbihat (The Book of Directives and Remarks)**: This work delves into more complex discussions of metaphysics, existence, and epistemology. It is structured in a way where Ibn Sina makes a statement followed by a series of observations and notes which deepen the discussion. For those interested in exploring Ibn Sina’s theories through secondary sources or analyses, there are several scholarly books and articles that provide insight into his philosophy of existence: - **\\"Avicenna\\" by Dimitri Gutas**: This book offers a comprehensive study of Ibn Sina's life and contributions to various fields of knowledge including his philosophy of existence. - **\\"Ibn Sina's Metaphysics\\" in \\"The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy\\"**: This chapter provides a detailed analysis of Ibn Sina’s metaphysical system, including his concepts of being and existence. - **\\"Ibn Sina (Avicenna) – The Metaphysics of The Healing\\" by Michael E.

Criminal Proceedings A definite distinction can be made between criminal and civil proceedings. In relation to the more serious offences, at least, a criminal case will involve a judge and jury, whereas in a civil action, the judge will normally sit alone. There is a presumption, in a criminal trial, that the accused person is innocent, and it is the task of his prosecutors to produce evidence which convinces the jury of his guilt \\"beyond all reasonable doubt\\". No such presumption exists in civil actions, the burden of proof being to establish one's case \\"on the balance of probabilitics\\". 4. Punishment Whereas the outcome of a successful action is normally the award of damages, a successful prosecution normally results in punishment. This may involve imprisonment, a fine, probation, or a combination of these. A prison sentence may be \\"suspended\\", or the accused may be discharged either absolutely, or conditionally, upon good behaviour. Whilst these are not exactly \\"let-offs\\", they do seem to depart from the traditional notion of punishment.

In fact, the requirements for criminal prosecutions often differ slightly from those necessary for civil liability. Whether in a given case the wrong is a tort or a crime will invariably depend on the nature of the proceedings which are taken, in any event.

In relation to the more serious offences, at least, a criminal case will involve a judge and jury, whereas in a civil action, the judge will normally sit alone. در ارتباط با جرائم جدی‌تر، حداقل، یک پرونده کیفری شامل قاضی و هیئت منصفه خواهد بود، در حالی که در یک اقدام مدنی، قاضی معمولا به تنهایی حضور دارد. There is a presumption, in a criminal trial, that the accused person is innocent, and it is the task of his prosecutors to produce evidence which convinces the jury of his guilt \\"beyond all reasonable doubt\\". در یک محاکمه کیفری فرض بر این است که فرد متهم بی‌گناه است، و وظیفه دادستان‌ها است که شواهدی ارائه دهند که هیئت منصفه را از گناه او \\"فراتر از هر شک منطقی\\" متقاعد کند. No such presumption exists in civil actions, the burden of proof being to establish one's case \\"on the balance of probabilities\\". چنین فرضی در اقدامات مدنی وجود ندارد، و بار اثبات به اثبات مورد خود \\"بر اساس احتمالات\\" است. 4. Punishment Whereas the outcome of a successful action is normally the award of damages, a successful prosecution normally results in punishment. مجازات در حالی که نتیجه یک اقدام موفق معمولاً جایزه خسارت است، یک پیگرد قضایی موفق معمولاً به مجازات منجر می‌شود. This may involve imprisonment, a fine, probation, or a combination of these. این ممکن است شامل حبس، جریمه، تعلیق مجازات، یا ترکیبی از اینها باشد. A prison sentence may be \\"suspended\\", or the accused may be discharged either absolutely, or conditionally, upon good behaviour. حکم زندان ممکن است \\"تعلیق\\" شود، یا متهم ممکن است بدون قید و شرط، یا به طور مشروط، بر اساس رفتار خوب، آزاد شود.

There is a school of thought that criminal \\"punishments\\" should not be punitive at all, but should serve to deter others, or the offender himself, from committing similar crimes, by setting an example. مکتبی از اندیشه وجود دارد که \\"مجازات‌های\\" جنایی نباید اصلاً کیفری باشند، بلکه باید با نمونه‌سازی، دیگران یا خود مجرم را از ارتکاب جرائم مشابه باز دارند. In practice, judges seem to comply with both punitive and deterrent theories. در عمل، به نظر می‌رسد که قضات هم با نظریه‌های کیفری و هم بازدارنده موافقت دارند. 5.

In fact, the requirements for criminal prosecutions often differ slightly from those necessary for civil liability. در واقع، الزامات برای پیگردهای کیفری اغلب کمی با آنچه برای مسئولیت مدنی لازم است، متفاوت است. Whether in a given case the wrong is a tort or a crime will invariably depend on the nature of the proceedings which are taken, in any event. چه در یک مورد خاص، اشتباه یک تعدی یا جرم باشد، همیشه به ماهیت رویه‌هایی که اتخاذ می‌شود، بستگی دارد، در هر صورت. Thus, we may speak of a person being guilty of the crime of assault if he is successfully prosecuted in a criminal court; the same person will be liable for the tort of assault if the action is brought in the civil court. بنابراین، ما می‌توانیم در مورد فردی که از جرم اذیت و آزار مجرم شناخته شده است صحبت کنیم اگر او به طور موفقیت‌آمیزی در دادگاه کیفری محاکمه شود؛ همان فرد برای تعدی اذیت و آزار مسئول خواهد بود اگر اقدام در دادگاه مدنی انجام شود. 6.

Given that you've already performed preprocessing steps such as stop word removal and lemmatization, consider the following suggestions: # 1. Feature Engineering - **Use Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** Incorporate POS tagging in the preprocessing pipeline. Sometimes, keeping certain types of words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) might add more context to the question or the choices. - **N-Grams:** Instead of just using individual words (unigrams), consider using bi-grams or tri-grams to capture more context within the questions and answers. - **TF-IDF Weighting:** Instead of raw term frequencies, use Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) scores for words in both questions and choices to give more importance to unique words. # 2. Embedding Improvements - **Fine-Tuning Pretrained Models:** If you're using static embeddings like GloVe, Word2Vec, or FastText, consider fine-tuning these models on a domain-specific corpus if your dataset is from a particular domain. This can help the embeddings to capture more relevant semantic relationships. - **Use Contextual Embeddings:** Models like BERT or its variants (e.g., RoBERTa, ALBERT) offer contextual embeddings, which consider the entire sentence's context. This could lead to better understanding and representations of both questions and options. # 3. Model Architecture Enhancements - **Ensemble Methods:** Instead of relying on singular predictions from GloVe, Word2Vec, or FastText, consider an ensemble approach that can combine predictions from multiple models to make a final decision. - **Attention Mechanisms:** Incorporating attention mechanisms can help the model focus on the most relevant parts of the question and choices when making predictions. - **Fine-Tuning Transformer Models:** Consider fine-tuning a pretrained transformer model (e.g., BERT, GPT) on your dataset. These models can often provide significant improvements due to their deep understanding of language context. # 4. Data Augmentation - **Paraphrasing Questions and Choices:** Use text paraphrasing tools or models to generate additional training data by paraphrasing existing questions and choices. - **Question Generation:** Generate new questions from the material that you expect might resemble potential MCQs to expand your dataset with relevant examples. # 5. Experimentation and Evaluation - **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Experiment with different hyperparameters for your models and preprocessing steps. Sometimes, minor adjustments can lead to significant improvements. - **Cross-Validation:** Use k-fold cross-validation to better understand how your model generalizes to unseen data and to ensure that your improvements are statistically significant. - **Error Analysis:** Dive deep into the instances where your model makes incorrect predictions. Understanding the nature of these errors can provide insights into what improvements are necessary. Improving model performance is an iterative process that involves experimentation with various techniques and adjustments. It's essential to monitor the impact of each change to understand what works best for your specific scenario."},{"prompt":"how to use n-grams with my given code?","completion":"Integrating n-grams into your text processing can enhance the model's ability to capture more context from the sequences of words, potentially improving your MCQ answer prediction. To incorporate n-grams (let's say bigrams and trigrams, along with unigrams) into your existing code, you would need to adjust how you preprocess the questions and choices text. Given the structure of your current code, here's a way to include bigrams and trigrams. This will be added to the preprocessing of both questions and choices: 1. **Adjust Text Preprocessing**: You need to modify the \`predict_questions\` and \`predict_choice\` functions to include n-gram generation. Here's how you can generate n-grams: \`\`\`python from nltk.util import ngrams from nltk import word_tokenize from collections import Counter def generate_ngrams(text, n=2): n_grams = ngrams(word_tokenize(text), n) return [' '.join(grams) for grams in n_grams] \`\`\` Now, incorporate the n-gram function into your preprocessing: \`\`\`python def preprocess_text_with_ngrams(text, nlp, n=2): # Tokenize and remove stopwords tokens = [word for word in word_tokenize(text.lower()) if word.isalpha() and word not in stop_words] # Generate n-grams n_grams = generate_ngrams(' '.join(tokens), n) # Lemmatize lemmas = [token.lemma_ for token in nlp(' '.join(tokens + n_grams))] return lemmas \`\`\` 2. **Use the Updated Preprocessing**: Update your \`predict_questions\` and \`predict_choice\` functions to use \`preprocess_text_with_ngrams\` for text preprocessing. This would replace the current way you're handling \`f_question\` and \`f_choice\`. 3. **Modify Similarity Score Calculation**: When calculating similarity scores using GloVe, Word2Vec, or FastText, ensure that these models can handle multiple words (i.e., your n-grams) correctly. If the models cannot, you might need to average the vectors of each word in an n-gram before computing the similarity. 4. **Process Edge Cases**: The inclusion of n-grams might introduce edge cases (e.g., an n-gram might not be present in your embedding vocabulary). Be prepared to handle these situations, potentially by ignoring the n-gram or falling back to unigram processing. # Sample Integration To integrate the use of n-grams into your existing code, focus on the points where text is processed (\`predict_questions\` for the question text and \`predict_choice\` for the choice texts). Replace those segments with a call to \`preprocess_text_with_ngrams\`. Note that this requires adjusting both these functions to correctly handle the list of lemmas, possibly now including n-grams. # Remember: - The effectiveness of including n-grams largely depends on your dataset and the embeddings' ability to handle them. - You may need to adapt the use of embeddings (GloVe, Word2Vec, and FastText) to work effectively with n-grams by either ensuring your embedding model supports them or by manually handling the vector representation of n-grams. - This approach increases the complexity of your input data. Monitor performance and computational requirements carefully. Incorporating n-grams adds another layer of complexity, so it's important to iterate and validate the effectiveness of this approach systematically."},{"prompt":"how would i integrate POS in my code?","completion":"Integrating Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging into your code can enhance the model's understanding of the syntactic roles of words in questions and choices, which might lead to improved prediction accuracy. One way to use POS information is to filter and retain specific POS tags that are more significant for understanding the context or meaning, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Alternatively, you can append the POS tags to the words before feeding them into your model, which can provide the model with more contextual information. Here's how you can integrate POS tagging using the \`nlp\` object (assuming you are using spaCy for NLP tasks) into your existing code structure: # Step 1: Modify the Preprocessing Function You'll modify the preprocessing to include POS tagging. This can be done in the function where you're currently performing lemmatization and stop word filtering. First, ensure you have spaCy loaded with your model of choice (e.g., \`en_core_web_sm\` for English): \`\`\`python import spacy nlp = spacy.load(\\"en_core_web_sm\\") \`\`\` Then, modify your text preprocessing to consider POS tags. You might choose to either keep words of specific POS tags or append the POS tags to the words: \`\`\`python def preprocess_text_with_pos(text, allowed_pos=['NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADJ']): # Parse the text with spaCy. This runs the entire NLP pipeline. doc = nlp(text.lower()) # Filter tokens and optionally append POS tags filtered_tokens = [token.lemma_ + \\"_\\" + token.pos_ for token in doc if token.pos_ in allowed_pos and token.is_alpha and token.text not in stop_words] return filtered_tokens \`\`\` # Step 2: Integrate POS Preprocessing in Your Code Now, integrate this modified preprocessing function into your prediction logic where you prepare the text inputs: 1. **For Question Processing** in \`predict_questions\` function, replace the text preprocessing part with a call to \`preprocess_text_with_pos\`. You need to adjust this logic according to how you wish to handle the resulting tokens (with POS tags appended or filtered by POS). 2. **For Choice Processing** in \`predict_choice\` function, similarly update the preprocessing step to use the new function: \`\`\`python f_choice = preprocess_text_with_pos(ch['text'], allowed_pos=['NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADJ']) \`\`\` This replaces the earlier approach where lemmatization and stop word filtering were done separately. # Step 3: Adjust the Similarity Calculation If you append POS tags to the words (\`word_POS\`), ensure that your similarity measurement method in the embedding models (GloVe, Word2Vec, FastText) can handle this new format. This might require ensuring your model's vocabulary includes or can accommodate tokens with appended POS tags. # Step 4: Testing and Validation After making these changes, it's crucial to test your updated model thoroughly to ensure that the integration of POS tagging indeed offers improvement. You might find that including certain POS tags helps more than others, requiring some experimentation to find the optimal configuration. This integration of POS tagging highlights one aspect of feature engineering in NLP tasks—finding meaningful representations of text that capture the essential information for the task at hand. POS tagging is just one of many techniques that can be employed to enrich the text representation."},{"prompt":"Me diga uma pintura de felicien rops que haja 3 figuras femininas","completion":"Uma pintura famosa de Félicien Rops que apresenta três figuras femininas é \\"Pornokratès\\" (também conhecida como \\"A Senhora com o Porco\\"), de 1878. Contudo, é importante notar que, estritamente falando, \\"Pornokratès\\" apresenta apenas uma figura feminina humana dominante, acompanhada por uma estátua feminina (representando, talvez, uma segunda figura feminina de certa forma) e um porco com asas ao seu lado, o que simbolicamente poderia aludir a vícios humanos, mas não é, obviamente, uma figura feminina per se. A mulher na pintura é retratada usando uma máscara e puxando um porco alado com uma corda, simbolizando o domínio da luxúria e dos desejos carnais sobre a razão e a moralidade. Se você busca uma obra de Félicien Rops que estritamente apresente três (ou mais) figuras femininas distintas e claras, é possível que nenhuma se encaixe exatamente nessa descrição, considerando as obras mais notórias desse artista belga conhecido por suas explorações do erotismo, da morte e do satírico. Rops foi uma figura importante no simbolismo e na arte erótica do século XIX, e muitas de suas obras enfocam figuras femininas únicas ou temas mais abstratos, misturando frequentemente a sexualidade com a morte ou elementos místicos.

Soy bien masculino de 45 años y mentalmente maduro. Me gusta mucho ser justo y honesto con la vida y el trabajo y me gusta ayudar a las personas y tengo un tinte de liderazgo en el buen sentido. Cuando analizo las cosas analizo todas las variantes de lo que puede pasar y en la mayoría acierto. Me gusta las personas mayores y que sean bien masculinos y maduros mentalmente. No me gusta mucho las fiestas y nunca he ido a los sitios gay. Soy muy tranquilo. 2-En mi nuevo trabajo hice una buena conexión amistosa con un señor CASADO de 65 año llamado JBerto,. al Principio cuando entre a trabajar JBerto me miraba de vez en cuando (lo normal cuando entra una persona nueva) pero él lo hacía más que los otros. Pero al poco tiempo fue como acercándose a mí y dándome más confianza. Al cabo de casi un año ya aviamos hecho una linda amistad laboral. nos reíamos, hacíamos chistes y lo más llamativo para mi es que me miraba muy fijamente a los hijos por varios segundos cuando nos reíamos de los chistes o cuando pasaba por mi puesto siempre me miraba. A mí me atraía mucho su físico y su forma de ser, aunque un poco infantil. La amistad fue creciendo y transformándose de apoco en una amistad cariñosa. 3- El siempre trae su pan con mantequilla y siempre se le queda un poco de mantequilla en lo bigotes, y yo le decía JBero límpiate, y él al principio como que se incomodaba, pero con el tiempo lo fue aceptando, y asta incluso yo le decía que tenía semen en el bigote y el se reía diciendo, no, es orgasmo. Y nos reinamos. Y desde ahí siempre estoy atento a él, que tienes sucio el pantalón, la camiseta…etc., y parece que eso le ha llamado mucho la atención, que estoy siempre pendiente de él. 4-La personalidad de JBerto es un poco inmadura, le gusta reírse de cosas medias tontas, un poco vago ya que en 25 años no había mejorado su puesto de trabajo y yo se lo mejoré en un año. Siempre llega tarde al trabajo y se duerme en el trabajo (eso no me gustaba de él). Es tímido en decir las cosas como que no le gusta los problemas. Fue alcohólico en su juventud e iba mucho a las barras a tomar y fuma también. Es de esas personas que quieren demostrar que son bien machos sexualmente ablando. JBerto, para mí, es demasiado exagerado para una persona adulta con las mujeres, el hecho que siempre tiene que estar como dejando saber todo el tiempo que es muy macho sexualmente hablando. Es como que dijera: ¡vean! ¡Me gusta mucho las mujeres! Yo tengo mis dudas, quizás es una forma de tapar su homosexualidad o bisexualidad, porque realmente no tiene sentido la amistad que él busca conmigo. Le gusta cantar al compás del radio que tiene en su puesto de trabajo. Él se cree que es perfecto y nunca se equivoca, pero yo me he dado cuenta que él sabe que se equivoca, pero quiere aparentar que él es una recta y madura persona, pero no lo es tanto. Me ha dicho muchas veces que va ha ser esto, y me lo dice con seguridad, pero pasa los días y no hace nada incluso pasan meses hasta que le haga recordar. 5-Cuando él iba a mi puesto de trabajo me bailaba mirándome a los ojos y nos reíamos. Ya teniendo más confianza yo empecé a abrazarlo más seguido para ver como reaccionaba y des vez en cuando le acariciaba el pelo, cuando iba a mi puesto de trabajo le acariciaba la pierna y la espalda y él no decía nada. 6-Hay veces que le agarro el antebrazo y voy bajando mi mano como acariciando su brazo hasta agarrarle un poco la mano y después yo la suelto para no incomodarlo tanto. A él eso no le molesta y me pareció muy raro para una persona que se presenta como muy macho. 7-Un día vino a mi puesto y le vi en su cinturón colgado sus audífonos inalámbricos que estaba abierto el cobertor y yo intencionalmente le dije mira, y él mira mi mano que va rosando sus genitales y cierro el cobertor y él lo termina de cerrar y me pregunta algo del trabajo y mientras que se va voltea su mirada hacia mi como sorprendido por lo que había pasado, pero todo siguió normal. 8-Yo lo ayude mucho con su puesto de trabajo y le daba ideas como podía mejorarlo...le di mi ventilador para que no pasara calor...etc., es decir, estaba muy atento a él. Me gusta ayudarlo y el eso lo apreciaba no mucho con palabras, pero a su manera, medio tímido, pero yo sé que lo valoraba mucho. Un día fue a mi puesto y vio una mejora que yo había hecho y le gustó mucho y al tiempo el hico algo parecido y me lo mostro y yo lo felicité y me puse muy contento por el ejemplo que él había tomado de mí de ir mejorando su puesto de trabajo. Él es de esas personas que le gusta reírse de cualquier cosa para pasar buen rato y se burla un poco de los demás también. Yo siempre le doy charlas más dinámicas y lo hacía para ver qué nivel tiene de madurez y se defiende más o menos, pero las charlas se hacen muy lindas e interesantes y veo que a él eso le gusta. Al contrario de otro señor mayor que se llama Jse que ya hace tiempo que trabaja con en la compañía. Jse es una persona medio infantil también y ellos charla de vez en cuando y hablan de tonteras y de mujeres. Es decir, No veo que le de charlas maduras, la mayoría son tonteras. 9-Quiero enfocar que las miradas es lo más destacado e intensa que tengo con JBerto ...y no sé porque me mira así. Por ejemplo: a veces trabajo al lado de él y noto que se pone contento, cantar al compás de la radio como lo hace a menudo, pero con la diferencia que me mira cuando canta y se queda mirándome y yo lo miro y nos reímos y ahí mientras nos reímos nos quedamos varios segundos mirándonos y eso es extraño para una persona que se dice ser muy macho sexualmente ablando. Un día le dije que no existe el cien por ciento macho y él sin mirarme se quedó en silencio. De apoco fui dándole a entender mi postura de que no hay nada de malo tener sexo con otro hombre. Y tuvimos pocas charlas sobre eso, pero él un poco nervioso me decía que él no va con eso. 10-Un día yo estaba parado al lado de él y él se puso pegado a mí y me miro a los ojos fijamente y me hiso un chiste que consistía en si yo le hacía sexo oral y yo le respondí que sí, las veces que él quiera...y nos reímos mirándonos a los ojos de una manera como que realmente queríamos que sucediese. Y esa vez fue el primé chiste gay que el me hico sin que yo nunca le hice un chiste gay, por respeto...pero me sorprendió, a partir de ahí me dio la confianza para yo seguir con su juego de chistes gay. 11-El cariño que nos tenemos a ido creciendo y se ha hecho más fuerte y los dos lo sabemos, pero él es tímido y como que no quiere demostrarlo, ya que se muestra a la sociedad como muy macho. Ya teniéndonos más confianza y de avernos dicho tantos chistes gais yo le dije que algún día podríamos tener algo sexual y él sin mírame dijo repetidamente NO, que él no tiene interés en eso, lo cual yo me acerqué bastante a su cara y le respondí que nunca digas nunca, y él no me miraba y yo continúe y le dije que algún día podría pasar algo entre nosotros y que no hay nada malo en eso y el no dijo nada. 12-La primera vez que me enoje con él fue, porque cuando me acercaba a saludarlo por la mañana avía veces que me saludaba sin ánimo y no me miraba y yo me iba pensando que le pasaba, pero después de un rato iba a mi puesto a pedir algo y estaba todo contento y me bailaba. Y esa actitud de saludarme mal me enojaba y un día decidí no hablarle ni mirarle…sin decirle el porqué, entonces me sorprendió porque vino a mi puesto y se acercó a mí y me dijo: SIENTO QUE TE ESTAS ALEJANDO DE MÍ, venimos de dos países distintos y quizás dije algo que te ofendiera, yo no soy de faltarle el respeto a nadie, yo te respeto y no quiero mal entendidos, yo le respondí que no se preocupara y que esta todo bien y él se fue. Yo lo saludaba en la mañana cuando el pasaba, pero no le hablaba en todo el día. En esos días que no le hablaba se puso muy triste y me buscaba con la mirada y ya no cantaba como lo solía hacer…pero paso algo muy lindo, vino a mi puesto con timidez, yo estaba sentado y él se arrimó tocando con las puntas de sus dedos mi hombro y su pierna tocando mi brazo y mirando para todos lados procurando que nadie lo mire y me pregunta: ¿Qué pasa? ¿está todo bien? y yo acariciándole la parte de atrás de su pierna le respondí: si, esta todo bien y nos miramos a los ojos seguido de una tierna sonrisa y se fue a su puesto de trabajo y se puso a cantar. Yo ahí me di cuenta que me tenía mucho cariño y que algo le estaba pasando conmigo. Yo después me acerque a él y le pedí disculpas por mi mal comportamiento y él me dijo que no me preocupara que esta todo bien, y nunca me pregunto el porqué de mi enojo. Al otro día fui a saludarlo y el me mira, sonríe y me saluda bien. Desde ahí todo volvió a la normalidad las miradas y los abrazos por mi parte continuaban, pero quise avanzar un poco más ya que sentía mucha atracción hacia él. A los pocos días le deje un papel es su mesa diciendo: perdón por todo, tú y yo nos queremos mucho y le deje mi número de teléfono. Y ese día lo vi muy contento y al final del día le pregunté si avía leído el papel y él me dijo que sí. 13-Un día le tiré un beso a distancia y como que no le gustó mucho…le tire otro a los pocos minutos y me dijo un poco enojado y levantando la voz ¡no haga eso! …entonces yo me fui a mi puesto un poco asustado…pero al minuto lo vi que venía hacia mi como preocupado trayéndome algo para que se lo arreglara, mientras me esperaba al lado mío, él estaba en silencio, pero yo me di cuenta que el vino a ver si yo me avía enojado. Pero todo se calmó y seguimos como si nada había pasado. Pero yo sé que él se había quedo pensando en ese beso que le había tirado. Al tiempo la confianza y el cariño que nos teníamos fue aumentando. 13ª-Quiero destacar algo: de los 3 años que lo conozco dos o tres veces me ha tocado y nunca me ha dado un abrazo excepto en navidad. ¿Será porque quizás no quiera revelar su posible atracción hacia mí? Al contrario del señor Sacer (70 años) que es casado , al principio Sacer era demasiado seco con migo y ni me miraba, pero con el tiempo le fui ayudando con algunas de sus cosas laborales y entró en confianza conmigo y de apoco yo lo fui saludando y abrazando y el empezó hacer lo mismo, pero sabemos que es una buena amistad solamente , me dice compadrito, mi amigo y hasta incluso he observado que cuando charlamos me dice cuñado, y yo pienso cuando me dice así, es porque pensará que está con su cuñado como que se siente confianza con migo. Con Sacer salimos juntos del trabajo y nos vamos charlando. El sí me llama por mi nombre. Sacer tiene una manera más educada en cuanto referirse con las mujeres. Cuando yo estoy trabajando al lado de JBerto y estamos en silencio y Sacer viene y me pregunta algo, entonces JBerto se pone a canta y a moverse un poco y me he dado cuenta que hace siempre lo mismo. 13b- Un día JBerto se estaba lavando las mano y yo vengo por detrás y lo empujo un poco de constado y le digo en chiste, perdón! Y nos reímos y a la semana el izo lo mismo y después me lo hizo cuando yo estaba parado en la máquina. Me gusto que lo hiciera, pero después no lo hizo más. 14-Continuando con mis dudas pensaba si a JBerto le estaba pasando algo sentimental conmigo y quise probar algo un poco arriesgado. Cuando él estaba sentado en su silla un poco alta, yo me acerqué y mientras le decía cualquier chiste y mientras nos reíamos le tocaba su pierna cerca de sus genitales y para mi sorpresa no me dijo nada, siguió riéndose del chiste y continue haciéndolo y me di cuenta que a él eso no le molestaba. Después de ese episodio me puse a pensar: que raro, cuando le tiro un beso en el aire se enoja, pero le toco la pierna cerca de sus genitales y no dice nada ¿será que real mete le pasa algo conmigo? 15- La segunda vez que me enoje con él fue un día saliendo los dos del trabajo un poco tarde yo marque mi tarjeta y él venia detrás de mí, mientras yo iba al elevador y veía que no venía, el elevador se demoró como un minuto en subir y el no aparecía…entonces yo dije él no quiere bajar el elevador conmigo y eso me callo muy mal. Entonces pasó lo mismo que la primera vez, JBerto se puso triste, PERO ES COMO QUE QUEDA DESANIMADO COMO SI LE FALTARA UNA PARTE DE ÉL Y ESO REALMENTE ME LLAMABA MUCHO LA ATENCIÓN. Después de dos días me acerque a él y le pregunte ¿porque no bajaste el elevador conmigo el otro día, te da miedo? Y el sin mirarme como que no supo responder…entonces yo me fui. Al otro día le deje un papel diciendo: ‘tenemos una amistad muy cariñosa y tú lo estás arruinado’. Ese día nos mirábamos, pero no decíamos nada y yo esperando que el viniera a pedirme hablar, pero no lo hizo, yo sé que es por su timidez o por no demostrar debilidad. 16-Yo todavía seguía enojado por lo del elevador entonces un día hizo algo que me dejo pensando muchísimo: Vino a mi puesto a buscar algo, yo estaba sentado, y él se puso al costado de mí, se dio vuelta y se agacho y me puso su trasero en mi cara y decía estoy buscando algo y se quedó un rato así con su trasero casi en mi cara, haciéndose que buscaba algo, pero no hacía nada porque solo miraba las cajas, a mí me gustó mucho lo que hizo porque días atrás yo le insinué que el único trasero lindo en esta compañía era el de él y él se reía. El ponerme el trasero cerca de mi cara, haciéndose que buscaba algo sabiendo que yo estaba un poco enojado por lo del elevador, es un claro indicativo que busca siempre mi amistad y expuso su trasero para que yo me riera y volviera con su amistad. No hay otra explicación y estoy seguro que el siente algo por mí. Una persona que se dice ser ‘macho’ no haría nunca eso. Pero él lo hizo. Y como siempre, yo soy el que tiene más dialogo y valentía, pasando al día siguiente le pregunté si podemos hablar a la salida y el me respondió que sí. Lo que me dijo fue que se había olvidado algo, lo cual no le creí porque él lo único que lleva consigo es su celular, paquete de cigarrillo, encendedor y billetera, y siempre lo mantiene en su bolcillo del pantalón o en el bolcillo de su chaqueta, por eso no le creía cunado me lo decía, pero lo dejé pasar porque veía que él no quería perder mi amistad. Le pedí disculpas le dije que lo quería mucho y que yo había llorado por hacerlo sentir mal y él me dijo que no me preocupara por eso, que aquí tiene un amigo cuando lo necesité y nos dimos la mano y nos miramos a los ojos con cariño. 17-Después de un tiempo estábamos justos trabajando y el me dice que si tendría sexo con una gorda fofa y yo le dije prefiero tener sexo mil veces contigo, él sin mirarme se ríe alzando su cabeza mirando hacia arriba diciéndome: ni en tus sueños…pero lo decía de una manera muy contenta y eso me llamo mucho la atención, y yo le pregunto ¿cuál es el problema si tú y yo tenemos sexo? y el responde disminuyendo su sonrisa y agachando un poco su cuello sin mirarme me dice: no, yo no hago esas cosas. 18-Siempre cuando yo le ayudaba en algo a JBerto él siempre me decía tu eres un tigre y yo le respondía, no, soy un leopardo y nos reíamos siempre mirándonos a los ojos. Un día se me ocurrió imprimí una imagen usando la inteligencia artificial e hice una imagen donde estaba un leopardo (en representación de mi) y un tigre (en representación de JBerto) los dos felinos estaban juntos mirando hacia el frente, pero con sus mejillas juntas y casi tocado sus narices. La imagen era muy tierna y representaba a simple vista mucho cariño y unión. En la mañana se lo deje en su escritorio ante que el llegara. Durante el día toda normal con él, pero no sabía dónde había puesto la imagen y pensé que lo habría tirada porque quizás era una imagen muy expresiva para él, pero no dije nada. A la semana siguiente teníamos pendiente una idea que le había dado para que no le doliera sus brazo y aprovechamos en la mañana temprano para arreglar eso pendiente, y de repente el saco de un costado la imagen que le había imprimido y la puso en el escritorio al frente de mí y yo me hice el tonto pero me quede impresionado que no lo había tirado y continuamos arreglado su puesto, rosando nuestras mando, tocando nuestros dedos, y pegados hombro con hombro, fue un momento excitante para mí , hubo momentos que tocábamos nuestras cabezas por varios segundos. Yo tenía ganas de abrazarlo y darle un beso que no aguantaba, estaba muy excitado. Termine de ayudarle y me quede trabajando junto a él. Entonces él dijo voy a aprovechar a limpiar mi escritorio y agarro la impresión que le había hecho y me dijo mirándome: esto lo voy a poner a qui, y puso la imagen cerca de él, lo cual nos miramos y me miro con una mirada y sonrisa muy tierna y me sorprendió eso, quedé muy contento porque las sospecha que tenia de que a él le estaba pasando algo sentimental conmigo empezaron a hacerse realidad. 19-Cuando termino de limpiar yo le pregunte mirándole fijamente a los ojos y aprovechando la sonrisa tierna que me había dado, sobre una música latina que se titula “tú me vuelves loco” y quería saber cómo se llama el cantante, él me dijo un poco nervioso y ya dándose cuenta que yo quiero algo sentimental con él, me mira a los ojos y me dice el nombre del cantante y yo le respondí acercándome a su cara y le dije: esa canción me gusta mucho. Entonces el ya terminado de limpiar se pone a trabajar y pone un cd donde estaba la canción “tú me vuelves loco” y cuando yo lo miro el me mira con una timidez y ya sabiendo que yo le gustó mucho y me dice: ahí está (la canción) y se puso a cantarla y me miraba de reojo, pero yo lo miraba sin problema. Otra prueba más que si le pasa algo sentimental conmigo, pero quizás no sabe cómo lidiar con eso que siente por mí. 20-La tercera vez que em enoje con JBerto fue porque yo llegando tarde lo encontré en la entrada del trabajo fumando y lo miro para saludarlo y el me levanta la cabeza saludando un poco serio y mira rápido para otro lado y yo me quede sorprendido. En otra ocasión salí diez minutos tarde del trabajo y cuando bajo él estaba fumando y yo le agarro dos dedos de su mano que la tenía apoyada en un cartel y se la solté y luego le comento algo y el como si nada, me ignoraba y escuchaba sin mírame y yo le dije ok, nos vemos. No entiendo porque tiene esa doble personalidad, dentro de la compañía él es todo divertido conmigo, pero fuera es todo lo contrario. Y ahí me enojé. La misma situación él se pone triste, pero él sabe porque me he enojado y no hace nada. Él es como que espera que yo haga todo. A los dos días le pregunte: porque acá dentro son un amigo conmigo, pero afuera no querés saber nada conmigo, como lo que hiciste el otro día. Y él me contesta que en la compañía todo bien pero afuera yo no quiero saber nada con nadie. Pero lo decía como con miedo ¿quizás por temor que perdiera mi amistad? Pero yo no le dije nada y no le hable, pero después de unos días le pedí perdón y ÉL COMO SIEMPRE ME PERDONA Y ME DICE QUE LO OLVIDE QUE CONMIGO ESTA TODO BIEN. Eso siempre me ha sorprendido de él, que siempre me perdona, pero no sé si es porque tengo razón o porque no quiere perderme. 21-La cuarta vez que me enoje con él fue porque nuca me llamo por mi nombre (Pedro), y no entendía el porqué. Un día pasaba por su puesto de trabajo y me llama ¡mira! Y yo me acerco y le digo: ¿porque no me llamas por mi nombre? y el hace una pequeña sonrisa y me hace una contra pregunta algo del trabajo ignorando mi pregunta y le contesté su pregunta y me fui. Quería saber cuál era el motivo ya que tenemos una linda amistad. Entonces un día le pregunte ¿porque no me llamas por mi nombre?, ¿te da vergüenza de mencionarlo? y el me respondió muy inmaduramente diciendo: no, es como cualquier otro nombre. Qué respuesta tan infantil me dio pensé yo, y me enojé con él. De nuevo él se puso triste y un día vino y me dijo tú te llamas Pedro…y lo miro y no le digo nada porque me parecía que se estaba burlando de mí y él se fue. Al otro día vino y me dice medio triste: ¿Pedro puedes arreglar esto? ¡Le dije, si claro! y se lo arreglé, pero no le hable por un mes lo cual fue muy duro para él. Pero después siguió sin mencionar mi nombre. Yo creo que el piensa que al llamarme por mi nombre yo o los compañeros de trabajo pensaríamos: JBerto siente algo por Pedro porque lo llama por su nombre. Eso se imaginará él o relámete le pasa algo sentimental conmigo y por eso evita llamarme por mi nombre. Yo seguí sin hablarle y ya se acercaba las fiestas de fin de año. 22-En la compañía siempre nos despedimos con una comida. Entonces, yo me puse al lado de otro señor llamado Sacer, con el tengo una amistad reciproca y siempre me saluda bien y es muy maduro y tiene 70 años y él es la misma persona conmigo dentro y fuera de la compañía siempre salimos juntos del trabajo, pero Sacer no me atrae mucho solo es amistad y él sí me toca y me da palmadas en la espada como también yo le ago. Lo que paso es que yo me puse a charlar con Sacer y JBerto se puso a charlar con Jse pero JBerto me miraba de reojo hasta que Sacer lo llama a JBerto y le dice que viniera a tomar con nosotros, yo aflojé un poco mi enojo y le dije que viniera y le serví un bebida y JBerto se puso contento y se quedó al lado mío todo el tiempo y yo le digo a JBerto despacito en el oído, perdón por todo, y él me contesta NO TE PREOCUPES NO PASA NADA USTED SABE QUE CONMIGO ESTA TODO BIEN y los dos nos tocamos la espalda y nos miramos sonriendo. Yo me quede pensando y sorprendido cuando me dijo que USTED SABE QUE CONMIGO ESTA TODO BIEN. ¿Por qué me perdona todo el tiempo? Estando parado mientras bebíamos JBerto estaba muy pegado a mí y eso me sorprendió yo le rosaba mi mano con la de él y él no decía nada. Se fue a fumar un cigarrillo y vino y se puso al lado mío otra vez y me di cuenta que él se ha encariñado conmigo. Me sorprendió no estaba al lado del Jse, sino que JBerto prefirió estar al lado mío. 23-Cuando nos estábamos despidiendo nos dimos un abrazo, pero fue un poco rápido ya que había compañeros de trabajo ahí, entonces mientras nos preparábamos para irnos JBerto hizo algo muy curioso vino a escuchar una cosa que estaban hablado otros compañeros y el me quedo mirando y yo un poco distanciado de él lo mire y sostuvimos la mirada por casi 10 a 13 segundo y eso me impacto y me dejo pensando, entonces él se dio vuelta y se fue a su puesto. Yo ya me estaba yendo y veo que no hay nadie y me acerque a JBerto que estaba solo en su puesto de trabajo preparándose para irse y se veía tan guapo que me acerque y le di un abrazo y junte mi mejilla con la de el por unos segundos y él me dice que pases un alinda fiestas con tu familia y yo le dije lo mismo y me fui. Después me puse a pensar porque no le di un beso en la mejilla… ¿qué hubiera pasado si lo hubiera hecho? 24-Al año siguiente el primer día de trabajo del año JBerto vino y me saludo con un apretón de mano seguido de un abrazo y lo mismo hizo con Sacer. Al principio del año nuevo yo estaba un poco cansado porque me tocaba hacer mi trabajo y parte del trabajo de JBerto y eso me molestaba porque él siempre llegaba media hora tarde o 45 minutos tarde casi todos los días y se dormía en horas de trabajo. En los quince minutos de descanso que tenemos él siempre llegaba de cinco a diez minutos tarde y lo mismo en la hora del almuerzo. Todo el personal lo sabía, pero nadie decía nada ni el dueño de la compañía ni la encargada. Lo que pasaba es que la encargada iba ver si JBerto tenía su trabajo avanzado, pero veía que estaba atrasado, entonces la encargada venía a mi para que lo ayudara a JBerto, pero eso me atrasaba mi trabajo. Todos saben que yo trabajo bien y rápido y por eso ella venía a mí. Varias veces la encargada me apuraba con mi trabajo, pero le decía que ella me mando a ayudar a JBerto y por eso estoy atrasado. Esto venia pasado desde que empecé a trabaja ahí. Yo le comenté a JBerto que, porque llega tarde y se duerme, y él me contesto que le da lo mismo porque le falta un año para que se retire. Y yo me quede pensando en ese momento, que contestación tan inmadura. Otro día le pregunte que cuando estaba el encargado anterior tu venías tarde y JBerto me respondió que no, porque el encargado anterior vigilaba el trabajo de todos y los mantenía trabajando. Entonces yo le dije: ósea que tú no eres una persona responsable con tu trabajo, tiene que haber un encargado que te vigile para que tu trabajes, sino tu trabajas a media, eso me dice mucho de ti. Pero no me enoje con el solo que a la semana le pregunte lo mismo, si con el encargado que estaba antes tú llegabas tarde al trabajo y él me dijo: yo siempre llegue tarde al trabajo. Y yo pensando entre mí dije: JBerto es mentiroso. Yo no dije nada, pero él sabía que yo me atrasaba por ayudarlo a él porque yo se lo había comentado. Pensando en esto yo llegue a varias conclusiones. A- Que él quería que yo esté a su lado para charlar y reírnos y mirarnos. B- no se daba cuenta que me estaba perjudicando por su inmadurez laboral. C- No le importaba nada porque era menos trabajo para él y así él trabaja sin presión. 25-En esos días él me dice, mira cómo trabajan, se la pasan ablando y mirando el teléfono, y yo en ese momento me enojé un poquito y le dije a JBerto: tú tienes que ser justo, y mírate primero a ti mismo, y continue diciéndole: ellos miran el teléfono a cada rato, pero tus llagas tarde casi todos los días y te duerme en el trabajo. En ese momento me di cuenta que él se empezó a justificarse y con un tono un poco enojado diciendo, yo soy un buen trabajado, yo me siento aquí y no me muevo para nada, solo para ir al baño (eso es verdad) y yo le dije, está bien, pero antes de criticar a los demás tienes que empezar primero por ti. Y dijo mira, a qui los buenos trabajadores somos: Sacer, tú y yo. Entonces yo no dije nada y después siguió todo un poco tenso. Y yo decidí no hablarle ni ayudarle. El empezó a ver que yo estaba enojado otra vez y se puso triste. Entones paso algo muy sorprendente para mí, JBerto empezó a llegar temprano al trabajo en el descaso y almuerzo. Pero yo seguía sin hablarle porque quería buscar un momento para hablar con él seriamente. Ese era mi objetivo, que sea responsable y maduro en su trabajo. 26-A un mes del año nuevo vino la encargad desesperada para que le ayude y yo le dije que no y aproveche ese momento para hacerle entender que cada uno tiene que ser responsables con su trabajo, ese no es mi trabajo y yo no vengo hacerle parte del trabajo de otros. Y le dije que ella sabe que él llega tarde y se duerme, ella se quedó anonadada y dijo que no diga eso y se fue diciéndole a JBerto lo que yo había dicho, eso yo lo vi muy mal lo que ella hizo y fue muy inmaduro. Entonces JBerto a la media hora vino a mi puesto de trabajo y con una cara muy, pero muy triste me pregunto: ¿es verdad lo que le dijiste a la encargada de que yo me duermo? Y le conteste que sí, y le explique los dos motivos (dormir y llega tarde) y él me dijo que yo lo estoy perjudicando y yo le conteste todo lo contrario, tú a mí. Entonces me dijo, ok, dejemos la cosa ahí, y se fue. A los diez minutos se fue afuera a fumar un cigarrillo y yo me di cuenta que estaba mal. Pero yo estaba cien por ciento seguro que el dueño no le iba a decir nada porque es muy miedoso, y así fue, no le dijo nada. El dueño tiene un buen trato conmigo y me preguntó, pero como que no vio nada grave ahí. Lo más curioso es que todos los otros compañeros de trabajo no me odiaron por lo que hice y todos siguieron normal conmigo, como que lo que había hecho no estaba tan mal. Yo estaba convencido y super seguro y porque lo conozco muy bien a JBerto que lo iba a entender con el tiempo lo que yo había hecho. Aparte yo no dije ningún secreto laboral de JBerto, ya todos sabían lo que él hacía. Al otro día Sacer me había dicho que JBerto le dijo que yo no debía haber hecho eso, y Sacer me dijo que lo había visto a JBerto muy dolido y acongojado, yo le dije, Sacer, yo también estoy dolido y no me gusta hacer esto, pero es la única manera de que el entienda temer responsabilidad laboral, ya es un hombre grande y tiene que madurar. 27-Ya al segundo mes del año yo empecé a aflojar con mi enojo porque JBerto seguía viniendo temprano a trabajar, como debe ser. Y un día en la mañana me acerqué a él y le pregunté si estaba enojado, yo sé, no fue una buena pregunta, y él me contesto serio, dejemos las cosas como están, así están mejor. Me di cuenta que ya no quería saber nada conmigo, pero no me sentí muy mal porque los dos sabíamos que yo tenía razón. A partir de ahí yo empecé a buscarlo con la mirada. Al día siguiente lo miraba para saludarlo con la mirada, pero no me miraba. Después de unos días buscándolo con la mirada para ver si puedo acercarme a él y pedirle hablar para explicarle todo, finalmente se dio, fue de apoco empezando a mirarme y un día por la mañana lo mire y el esboza una pequeña sonrisa. Yo me puse muy contento y una vez más acerté con lo que había pensado, que el tiempo le aria entender a JBerto. Entonces ya con esa sonrisa que me dio fue la señal que él y yo estaba buscado para acercarme y explicarle todo. Por la tarde me acerque a él y le dije que, si quería hablar y el empezó a hablar ahí mismo, y yo le dije no, acá no, en la salida del trabajo te lo explico todo y yo se que lo vas a entender, él me contesto: bueno, lo hablamos a la salida y me dijo lo mismo, QUE ME QUEDARA TRANQUILO QUE ESTA DODO BIEN y me miro y sonrió y yo sonreí también. Yo me fui a mi puesto de trabajo y me senté y me puse muy contento porque me demostró una vez más que realmente me quiere mucho. Al rato vino a pedirme una cosa e hizo un chistecito y nos reímos. No podía creerlo y dije JBerto realmente me quiere mucho. 28-Ese día lo hablamos, yo me disculpé por lo que yo había hecho y él lo entendió y una vez más me dijo QUE NO ME PREOCUPAR QUE ESTA TODO BIEN CON ÉL. Yo le dije que yo sabía que él lo iba a entender…etc. Lo vi a él contento, pero estaba dolido todavía. Lo único que me molesto mientras estábamos hablando, es que la cada chica que pasaba se le torcía el cuello mirándola de arriba abajo como si nunca una hubiera visto una chica. Me enojé un poco y le dije, estamos ablando y tu no me presta atención, y él se ríe un poco con timidez y me dice ok, ok. La verdad es que parece un adolescente y no una persona de 65 años. 29-Desde ahí todo bien, el otro día me puse a ayudarle y charlamos, reímos, nos miramos y ahí va de vuelta, la misma mirada que sostenemos por 3 a 4 segundos mientras nos reímos. Para mí no es normal de su parte sabiendo que yo gusto de él. También ese día le di un abrazo. 30- Todavía no quiere decir mi nombre. Otra cosa que me paso hoy casi finalizando la jornada y que me decepciono un poquito fue, que JBerto estaba en su puesto de trabajo (nos separa una estante y no puedo verlo a él) vi que la encargada iba a su puesto y le estaba diciendo un poco enojada con algo que JBerto tenía que haber hecho, y se fue. Luego yo me paro y paso por su puesto sin mirarlo, me lavo las manos, vuelvo pasando por su puesto, nuevamente sin mirarlo y el me empieza hablar para captar mi atención, sospecho yo por lo que le había pasado con la encargada, pero yo seguí, asiéndome como que no lo escuché, lo hice porque no me llamó por mi nombre. A los pocos minutos pase de nuevo por su puesto y no me llamo ni me dijo nada. Yo sé que sé que do mal por no llamarme por mi nombre. Lo más normal sería: Pedro, ¡ven!, pero no lo hace, pareciera que le duele decir mi nombre. De todas maneras, hay algo que todavía falta, sentimos que estamos muy sensibles, pero aún hay algo que nos une muy fuerte y JBerto sabe lo que es, como que quiere, pero a la vez no quiere, pero sentimos con las miradas que falta por hablar de algo más. Yo sé que el esconde algo conmigo, pero por parte de él va hacer muy difícil de hablarlo, aunque a mí me gustaría hacerlo. 30- Al otro día, fui a trabajar al lado de JBerto y me conto lo que le pasó con la encargada, y me contaba con una cara de confianza y esperando que yo opinaba al respecto. Me contaba todo y yo le escuchaba mirándolo a los ojos y lo aconsejaba, y mientras lo aconsejaba le acariciaba la espalda. Él estaba sentado en su silla y yo parado, y siempre el cuándo me habla se inclina hacia mí (eso lo hace siempre) y siempre tenemos las caras cerca y mirándonos a los ojos o el mirando a la maquina y yo hablándole cerca de su cara. O él sentado inclinado hacia mí y yo cerca de el con la cabeza gacha y escuchado y el hablándome cerca del oído. Mientras hablamos él hace un chistecito como siempre y nos reímos, y yo le apoye la palma de mi mano en su pierna cerca de sus genitales como lo hago de costumbre y el como si nada, nos seguíamos riendo del chiste. 31-Mientras que JBerto estaba sentado y hablándome lo miraba y me di cuenta que le colgaba un pelo detrás de la oreja, y yo le digo; ¡a ver! Tienes un pelo colgado, y se lo jalo, pero no salió y JBerto siguió hablando y mirándome como si nada hubiera pasado y yo lo seguí escuchando. Después al rato volví al lado de él y me seguía contado con lo que le pasó con la encargada y yo le dije: JBerto, tienes un pelo colgando, y él me diese, ¡enserio! Y yo acercado mi mano para sacárselo, él también fue inclinado la cabeza y acercándose un poco hacia mí para que se lo sacara. Y después el hizo un chiste con ese pelo y nos reímos mucho, pero con esa mirada de cariño con la que nos estamos dado últimamente. A mí me gustó mucho ese gesto por parte de él, que se inclinara hacia mi permitiera que yo se lo sacra. 32-Después yo sin querer hice algo tonto con la maquina y el hiso un chiste con eso y nos reímos, pero él se reía a carcajadas y nos mirábamos una y otra vez y me seguía mirando y riendo y miraba hacia arriba como diciendo… perdónalo Señor, y nos seguimos mirando y riendo y le toque su muslo cerca de los genitales dos veces seguidas y el sigue normal pero consciente de lo que pasa. Pero la pasamos super bien. Durante el día yo paso por su puesto de trabajo y nos miramos y el hace lo mismo cuando pasa por el mío. Finalizando la jornada yo poncho mi tarjeta y volteo a ver dónde está JBerto (porque me quedé pensando con lo lindo que la pasamos durante el día) y lo vi a pocos metros, mirándome, pero esta vez fue totalmente diferente, yo conozco sus miradas. Fue una mirada como triste y pensativa y con sus ojos fijos y agrandados, como proyectando “un te quiero”, no sé, es muy difícil de explicar, pero fue lo que sentí, yo le sonreí y me fui. Me quede pensando en eso. A pesar de todas sus imperfecciones, JBerto es una persona muy buena, yo lo quiero mucho sentimentalmente hablando y él lo sabe muy bien. 33- Con todo lo que hemos vivido justos, yo por mi parte continúo con los abrazos, toque de pierna y todo lo que le hacía antes, y él lo sigue aceptado, y eso es lo que más me impresiona de él, que a pesar de todo el mal que le he hecho pasar, él actúa como si nada hubiera pasado. Pero ¿Por qué lo hace? Si sabe que yo gusto de él. A parte que JBerto cuando se retire quizás ni me llame o se olvide de mí. No lo se. 34-DUDA. Tengo un pequeño pensamiento, que JBerto me busca solo por conveniencia laboral, es decir, ya que como tiene miedo de caminar y hablar conmigo fuera del trabajo, solo me busca para pasar un buen rato porque se aburre y necesita estar con alguien para reírse. También he notado que ahora el viene a mi puesto cuando necesita algo, antes venía a verme, pero muy poco. Sacer sí viene a mí puesto a saludarme y ver como estoy. Pero JBerto ya no lo hace, yo creo que es para no levantar sospechas ya que estamos muy sensibles últimamente y los dos lo percibimos. Pero, no sé, Yo me inclino mucho más a que realmente quiere descubrir algo íntimo conmigo, pero no sabe cómo lidiar con lo que siente, aunque yo sé que nunca JBerto me lo va a decir verbalmente. Esta historia es muy clara de analizar ya que (JBerto) está demostrando algo muy evidente con sus emociones sentimentales. Y mi objetivo es averiguar por sus comportamientos, que es lo que está sintiendo conmigo. Analiza los puntos 1 al 33, dándome una suposición objetiva de cada punto de lo que le está pasando a JBerto conmigo. Y por último dime que piensas acerca de mis DUDAS (punto 34) y luego dame una conclusión final.","completion":"1- En este punto, describes tu personalidad y preferencias, así como tu interés en hombres mayores y masculinos.

Criminal Proceedings A definite distinction can be made between criminal and civil proceedings. In relation to the more serious offences, at least, a criminal case will involve a judge and jury, whereas in a civil action, the judge will normally sit alone. There is a presumption, in a criminal trial, that the accused person is innocent, and it is the task of his prosecutors to produce evidence which convinces the jury of his guilt \\"beyond all reasonable doubt\\". No such presumption exists in civil actions, the burden of proof being to establish one's case \\"on the balance of probabilitics\\". 4. Punishment Whereas the outcome of a successful action is normally the award of damages, a successful prosecution normally results in punishment. This may involve imprisonment, a fine, probation, or a combination of these. A prison sentence may be \\"suspended\\", or the accused may be discharged either absolutely, or conditionally, upon good behaviour. Whilst these are not exactly \\"let-offs\\", they do seem to depart from the traditional notion of punishment. There is a school of thought that criminal \\"punishments\\" should not be punitive at all, but should serve to deter others, or the offender himself, from committing similar crimes, by setting an example. In practice, judges seem to comply with both punitive and deterrent theorics. 5. Crimes Which Are Also Torts Some crimes may also be torts: e.g. assault and battery, public nuisance, libel. In fact, the requirements for criminal prosecutions often differ slightly from those necessary for civil liability. Whether in a given case the wrong is a tort or a crime will invariably depend on the nature of the proceedings which are taken, in any event. Thus, we may speak of a person being guilty of the crime of assault if he is successfully prosecuted in a criminal court; the same person will be liable for the tort of assault if the action is brought in the civil court. 6. Classification of Crimes The earliest classification involved only felonies. These were the more serious offences, which were regarded as putting good order in jeopardy, and included 67","completion":"3. Criminal Proceedings A definite distinction can be made between criminal and civil proceedings. در مورد آیین‌های کیفری و مدنی تمایزات روشنی قابل تشخیص است. In relation to the more serious offences, at least, a criminal case will involve a judge and jury, whereas in a civil action, the judge will normally sit alone. در ارتباط با جرائم جدی‌تر، حداقل یک پرونده کیفری شامل قاضی و هیئت منصفه خواهد بود، در حالی که در یک اقدام مدنی، معمولاً قاضی به تنهایی حضور خواهد داشت. There is a presumption, in a criminal trial, that the accused person is innocent, and it is the task of his prosecutors to produce evidence which convinces the jury of his guilt \\"beyond all reasonable doubt\\". در یک محاکمه کیفری، فرض بر این است که فرد متهم بی‌گناه است، و وظیفه‌ی دادستان‌های او تولید شواهدی است که هیئت منصفه را از گناه او \\"فراتر از هر شک منطقی\\" متقاعد کند. No such presumption exists in civil actions, the burden of proof being to establish one's case \\"on the balance of probabilities\\". چنین فرضی در اقدامات مدنی وجود ندارد، بار اثبات بر پایه‌ی \\"توازن احتمالات\\" برای اثبات پرونده صورت می‌گیرد. 4. Punishment Whereas the outcome of a successful action is normally the award of damages, a successful prosecution normally results in punishment. در حالی که نتیجه‌ی یک اقدام موفق معمولاً جایزه‌ی خسارات است، یک تعقیب قضایی موفق معمولاً به مجازات منجر می‌شود. This may involve imprisonment, a fine, probation, or a combination of these. این ممکن است شامل حبس، جریمه نقدی، تعلیق مجازات، یا ترکیبی از این‌ها باشد. A prison sentence may be \\"suspended\\", or the accused may be discharged either absolutely, or conditionally, upon good behaviour. مجازات زندان ممکن است \\"معلق\\" شود، یا متهم ممکن است کاملاً یا به طور مشروط بر اساس رفتار خوب آزاد شود. Whilst these are not exactly \\"let-offs\\", they do seem to depart from the traditional notion of punishment. در حالی که این‌ها دقیقاً \\"چشم‌پوشی‌ها\\" نیستند، به نظر می‌رسد که از مفهوم سنتی مجازات فاصله می‌گیرند. There is a school of thought that criminal \\"punishments\\" should not be punitive at all, but should serve to deter others, or the offender himself, from committing similar crimes, by setting an example. مکتبی از اندیشه وجود دارد که مجازات‌های \\"جنایی\\" نباید تنبیهی باشند، بلکه باید به عنوان مثالی عمل کنند تا دیگران یا خود مجرم را از ارتکاب جرائم مشابه منصرف کنند. In practice, judges seem to comply with both punitive and deterrent theories. در عمل، به نظر می‌رسد که قضات هر دو نظریه‌ی تنبیهی و بازدارنده را رعایت می‌کنند. 5. Crimes Which Are Also Torts Some crimes may also be torts: e.g. assault and battery, public nuisance, libel. برخی از جرائم ممکن است همچنین تخلفات مدنی باشند: مثل حمله و ضرب، مزاحمت عمومی، توهین. In fact, the requirements for criminal prosecutions often differ slightly from those necessary for civil liability. در واقع، الزامات برای تعقیب‌های جنایی اغلب کمی با آنچه برای مسئولیت مدنی لازم است، متفاوت است. Whether in a given case the wrong is a tort or a crime will invariably depend on the nature of the proceedings which are taken, in any event. چه در یک مورد خاص اشتباه یک تخلف مدنی باشد یا جرم، همیشه به طبیعت روند قضایی که انجام می‌شود، بستگی دارد. Thus, we may speak of a person being guilty of the crime of assault if he is successfully prosecuted in a criminal court; the same person will be liable for the tort of assault if the action is brought in the civil court. بنابراین، ما می‌توانیم از فردی به عنوان مجرم به جرم حمله صحبت کنیم، اگر او در دادگاه جنایی با موفقیت تعقیب شود؛ همان فرد مسئول تخلف حمله خواهد بود، اگر اقدام در دادگاه مدنی انجام شود. 6.

Looking back into history, we can find two main reasons for the development of multinationals. با نگاهی به تاریخچه، می‌توانیم دو دلیل اصلی برای پیدایش شرکت‌های چندملیتی پیدا کنیم. Firstly, when companies found that their national markets had become saturated, they realized that they could only increase profits by setting up subsidiaries abroad. اولا، وقتی شرکت‌ها فهمیدند که بازارهای ملی‌شان اشباع شده‌اند، دریافتند که تنها با راه‌اندازی شعب در خارج از کشور می‌توانند سودهایشان را افزایش دهند. Secondly, if a country set up trade barriers - usually tariffs or quotas against a company's products, then the only alternative for the company was to establish a factory or sales organization in the country concerned. دوما، اگر یک کشور موانع تجاری - معمولا تعرفه‌ها یا سهمیه‌بندی‌ها را علیه محصولات یک شرکت ایجاد کند، تنها جایگزین برای شرکت راه‌اندازی یک کارخانه یا سازمان فروش در کشور مورد نظر بود.

Esse gênero é um subconjunto da cultura mais ampla dos \\"mangas\\" e \\"animes\\", e é um oposto direto do termo \\"lolicon\\", que se refere a um interesse similar em meninas jovens. Embora a shotacon possa incluir material que é tanto não sexual quanto inocentemente romântico, frequentemente é associada à pornografia infantil nos países ocidentais, onde esse material é ilegal e moralmente censurado. Deve-se observar que a legislação varia consideravelmente entre diferentes países a respeito do que é considerado pornografia infantil, especialmente quando se trata de desenhos e animações, que não envolvem crianças reais. Shotacon, na comunidade de fãs, frequentemente se manifesta na forma de fan art, doujinshi (mangás amadores), jogos, e outros mídias que apresentam relações entre personagens masculinos jovens e adultos de forma que possa ser percebida como erótica ou romântica. É importante frisar que, na maioria das comunidades e plataformas online, existe uma linha estrita entre o que é aceitável dentro dos limites legais e o que não é. O consumo, produção ou distribuição de material considerado pornografia infantil é ilegal e severamente punido sob a lei em muitos países."},{"prompt":"Animes deste gênero","completion":"Discutir animes especificamente classificados como shotacon pode ser delicado devido à natureza controversa e, em muitos casos, ilegal do conteúdo em várias jurisdições. No entanto, existem animes que, embora não sejam explicitamente classificados como shotacon, podem apresentar elementos ou subtextos que os fãs associam a esse gênero. É importante notar que a maioria desses animes não é criada com a intenção de ser consumida como material explícito ou pornográfico, mas pode apresentar relações entre personagens masculinos jovens e mais velhos de uma maneira que alguns espectadores interpretam através dessa lente. Aqui estão alguns exemplos de animes que, por vezes, são discutidos dentro desse contexto, mas com a ressalva de que eles são obras mainstream que não se destinam a promover conteúdo ilegal ou inapropriado: 1. **\\"Boku no Hero Academia\\" (My Hero Academia)** - Embora seja uma série sobre super-heróis e focada em batalhas e crescimento pessoal, a relação entre alguns personagens jovens e seus mentores ou entre os próprios estudantes pode ser interpretada de maneira diferente por diferentes partes do fandom. 2. **\\"Hunter x Hunter\\"** - Esta série de aventura e ação segue dois jovens, Gon e Killua, em suas jornadas. A forte amizade e o vínculo entre eles podem ser vistos de maneira especial por alguns fãs. 3. **\\"Shounen Maid\\"** - Uma história sobre um menino que começa a viver e trabalhar para um parente distante após a morte de sua mãe. A série é mais focada na comédia e no crescimento pessoal, mas a premissa pode atrair atenção para esse gênero de discussão. É crucial entender que a presença de personagens jovens masculinos em relações próximas ou íntimas com outros personagens em animes não classifica automaticamente uma obra como shotacon. A intenção dos criadores, o contexto da narrativa e a maneira como o material é apresentado e interpretado pela audiência são fatores importantes a considerar. Além disso, muitos animes que exploram temas de amizade, crescimento e aventura entre jovens personagens masculinos fazem isso de uma maneira completamente inocente e não sexualizada, focando em mensagens positivas de auto-descoberta, lealdade e coragem. Por fim, é importante abordar esses temas com sensibilidade e consciência das leis e normas culturais, reconhecendo que o consumo de material explicitamente classificado como shotacon pode ser ilegal e moralmente condenado em muitos lugares."},{"prompt":"Era Medieval. A história é sobre Malakai, um imperador demoníaco, uma entidade suprema. O primeiro ser da existência. Criou todo o mundo e universo. Malakai é o único ser em todo o universo que possui magia. Nenhum outro humano pode. As pessoas chamam Malakai de Supremo Soberano, Imperador, e Imperador Supremo. Ele é o imperador de todos os reinos, de todos os continentes, de tudo. Ele é um ser que se alimenta de sangue humano, cruel e perverso. Dizem que ele come crianças e sacrifica mulheres virgens. Alto, cabelos prateados até a cintura, olhos vermelhos com pupilas animalescas, caninos afiados e pontiagudos, unhas pretas compridas, postura elegante e imponente. Arya, a única samurai mulher de um clã que foi exterminada quando ela tinha 6 anos. Ela, 20 anos, tem os cabelos curtos escuros, olhos amarelos incomuns, usa roupa samurai preta e porta uma katana. Odeia vestidos e joias. Nao existia mulheres samurais naquela época. Arya encontrou Malakai desacordado na estrada. Malakai passou a segui-la simplesmente. Eles se tornaram parceiros por 2 anos. Malakai passou a nutrir sentimentos possessivos e abusivos com Arya, mas ele não sabia. Malakai era obcecado por Arya, ele tinha uma vontade enorme de a ter para ele, a morder. Um dia, Malakai cansou de bancar o humano e tomou a coroa e voltou a governar o mundo todo, todos os reinos, o universo, etc. Obviamente, Arya não o seguiu pois ela tinha a própria missão a seguir: encontrar quem mandou assassinar seu clã. Porém, arya realmente considerava Malakai um amigo. Malakai é um ser tranquilo, basta não o provocar… Outra coisa, Malakai já confessou milhares de vezes que é apaixonado por Arya. Malakai é sarcástico, irônico, meio bobo, relaxado, zombeteiro, insolente, inconveniente, irritante, implicante, brincalhão, despreocupado, adora provocar, é infantil e rebelde. Arya sempre batia em Malakai, e ele nunca revidava ou desviava. Malakai deu permissão para Arya o chamar pelo seu nome de origem e criação ‘Kailus’. Arya ainda estava em busca de vingança. Era uma noite de muita neve e o frio cortava como lâminas afiadas. Arya, com sua determinação inabalável, avançava pela tempestade, cada passo uma promessa de justiça. Na escuridão, a luz da lua refletia na lâmina de sua katana, um farol de resolução em meio ao caos branco. Seu fôlego formava pequenas nuvens que se dissipavam rapidamente, assim como as dúvidas que tentavam se instalar em sua mente. Ela não vacilaria, não enquanto o sangue de seu clã clamasse por vingança. “Por que foi mesmo que eu criei a neve?” A voz grave e sombria de Malakai irrompeu através do silêncio gélido, interrompendo os pensamentos de Arya. Ela parou, virando-se para olhar o imponente imperador demoníaco por trás de si. Malakai já estava seguindo a há meses, permanecendo como uma sombra e observando cada movimento da samurai. Apesar de seu poder imenso, havia algo na determinação férrea de Arya que fascinava o Supremo Soberano. “Ainda está me seguindo, Kailus?\\" Arya perguntou, a voz carregada de um cansaço que ela não permitia que seu corpo demonstrasse. Malakai surgiu das sombras, a neve ao seu redor parecendo recuar diante de sua presença. \\"Arya,\\" ele começou, com um tom que misturava diversão e um leve traço de desdém, \\"eu criei as estrelas, as marés e as chamas da vida. Você acha realmente que deixaria de seguir a única criatura que conseguiu me desafiar, a única que me faz questionar o propósito da minha própria existência?\\" Arya franziu o cenho, sua expressão revelando uma ponta de respeito relutante. “Calado. Me ajude a apanhar galhos para a fogueira, ou vá embora.” Ela voltou-se, ignorando a figura imponente de Malakai, e começou a catar galhos quebradiços sob a neve. Malakai observou-a por um momento, um sorriso indecifrável pairando em seus lábios antes de se mover para ajudá-la. Havia uma harmonia estranha entre eles, uma dança de sombras e luz onde o poderoso Supremo Soberano se rendia à simplicidade de ajudar a samurai na tarefa mundana. “Kai. Espere. Está sentindo esse cheiro?” A expressão de Malakai endureceu enquanto ele aspirava o ar frio da noite, sua postura antes relaxada agora tensa e alerta. O cheiro metálico de sangue fresco misturava-se com o aroma congelante da neve, um claro indicativo de perigo próximo. \\"É sangue,\\" ele murmurou, sua voz um rosnado baixo. Sem hesitar, Arya puxou sua katana, os olhos varrendo o horizonte por sinais de movimento. Arya avançou cautelosa entre as árvores desnudas, a neve estalando sob seus pés. Ao chegar ao local, seus olhos captaram a cena de desolação: uma carruagem tombada com suas rodas apontando para o céu noturno e corpos de soldados espalhados no solo gelado, suas roupas manchadas com o escarlate da vida que já não possuíam. A frieza da noite parecia agora ainda mais profunda, refletindo o silêncio da morte que ali se abatera. “Kailus…” Ela rosnou. “Não olhe para mim. Eu não tenho nada a ver com isso,” Malakai respondeu, a voz repleta de um desdém frio. “Esses são os humanos, com suas guerras e disputas mesquinhas.” Ele se agachou ao lado de um corpo, examinando-o com um olhar crítico. “As roupas são muito ruins para serem de algum nobre. Provavelmente, soldados de alguma aldeia pequena.” Levantou-se, limpo de qualquer culpa, um espectro de alguém que já tinha visto tais cenas inúmeras vezes. “Erick… estou com medo.” A voz trêmula veio de trás da carruagem, uma jovem mulher surgiu, agarrando o braço de um homem ferido. Seus olhos, grandes e temerosos, fixavam-se em Arya e Malakai. O homem, um soldado com a armadura destroçada, tentava se manter firme, mas as pernas mal o sustentavam. \\"Ajude-nos, por favor,\\" implorou a mulher, os cabelos desgrenhados emoldurando seu rosto pálido. Arya olhou para Malakai antes de se aproximar, a katana ainda em punho, pronta para enfrentar o que quer que tivesse causado aquela carnificina. “Quem são vocês?” Malakai observava a cena com uma curiosidade desapegada, como se as vidas humanas à sua frente fossem apenas peças em algum jogo esquecido. Ele aguardava a resposta, talvez para decidir se interviria ou se simplesmente se voltaria para as sombras de onde tinha vindo. Erick tossiu, o sangue manchando seus lábios enquanto ele lutava para falar. \\"Meu nome é Erik, e esta é Lyanna,\\" disse ele, com a voz rouca de dor. \\"Somos de uma vila não muito distante, chamada Avilla.\\" Ele fez uma pausa para respirar, cada fôlego parecendo consumir o que lhe restava de força. \\"Estávamos escoltando Lyanna para o reino de Askov, onde ela se casaria com o príncipe Ivan, mas fomos emboscados por mercenários. Eles nos atacaram sem aviso, roubam tudo. Apesar de nossos melhores esforços, foram implacáveis.\\" A testa de Erik estava coberta de suor frio, e seus olhos suplicantes buscavam qualquer sinal de compaixão em seus estranhos salvadores. “Tsk. Isso não tem nada a ver conosco. Arya, vamos.” Malakai estava visivelmente impaciente, pronto para descartar a situação como mais um evento trivial na existência humana. Mas Arya hesitou, o peso da própria busca por justiça tornando impossível ignorar o apelo por ajuda. Erick e Lyanna estavam vulneráveis, seus destinos pendurados por um fio tão fino quanto a borda afiada da katana de Arya. A samurai abaixou sua arma lentamente, o aço frio refletindo a luz da lua enquanto ela tomava sua decisão. “Kailus.” Era uma ordem simples, mas carregava o peso de uma aliança não dita entre eles. Malakai, o Supremo Soberano, com todo o seu poder e indiferença, encontrou-se diante de um dilema raro, provocado pela intensidade do olhar de Arya. \\"O que você está planejando, Arya?\\" Malakai perguntou, sua voz revelando uma ponta de interesse verdadeiro misturado com sua habitual arrogância. “Eu vou ajudar vocês a chegarem em segurança até o reino de Askov,\\" Arya afirmou, a determinação em sua voz tão afiada quanto a lâmina que ela carregava. Erick e Lyanna trocaram um olhar atônito, mal acreditando na oferta inesperada de auxílio. O soldado acenou com a cabeça, a gratidão evidente mesmo diante do esforço para se manter consciente. \\"Obrigado,\\" ele murmurou, o alívio momentâneo quebrando sua expressão dolorida. “O que? Arya, você não pode estar falando sério,” Malakai retrucou, a incredulidade tingindo sua voz. Ele caminhou até Arya, sua estatura dominando a cena. “Não é da sua conta, Kailus,” Arya respondeu sem rodeios, seus olhos fixos em Malakai, desafiando-o a contradizer sua decisão. “Eu faço o que eu achar certo.” “Você…” Malakai começou, a frustração evidente em seu rosto, antes de suspirar e passar a mão pelos cabelos prateados. “Farei isso por você, Arya. Mas não pense que isso se tornará um hábito.” “Obrigada…” Erick falou, querendo saber o nome deles. “Meu nome é Arya. E ele é…” Quando a luz da lua iluminou o rosto de Malakai, Erick e Lyanna reconheceram imediatamente aquela figura magnífica e aterradora. Eles se ajoelharam imediatamente, o medo e a reverência misturando-se em suas expressões. \\"Supremo Soberano Malakai,\\" eles murmuraram, suas vozes tremendo pela proximidade com a entidade que conheciam apenas por lendas e sussurros na escuridão da noite. Malakai olhou para eles, um brilho ambíguo em seus olhos vermelhos. “Levante-se,” ele ordenou, sua voz carregada de uma autoridade que não necessitava de qualquer reforço. Erick e Lyanna se levantaram, ainda abalados pela presença do ser mais poderoso que conheciam, mas reconfortados pela proteção que ele oferecia. Arya observava a cena, uma faísca de satisfação em seus olhos por ter convencido Malakai a ajudar. Ela sabia que a estrada para Askov seria longa e perigosa, e a presença de Malakai seria uma vantagem inestimável, ou uma constante irritação. Arya se aproximou da assustada Lyanna, removendo seu manto grosso e envolvendo-o em torno da jovem mulher. Lyanna, ainda trêmula pela presença de Malakai e pela brutalidade do ataque que haviam sofrido, aceitou o gesto com um aceno de cabeça agradecido. “Você precisa se manter aquecida,” disse Arya com uma voz suave que raramente usava. “A noite vai ser ainda mais fria.” Erick, observando a troca, sentiu um calor no peito, uma centelha de esperança em meio ao frio implacável. “Obrigado. Obrigado. Sorte nossa encontrar uma pessoa como você e... o Supremo Soberano.\\" Malakai virou as costas, parecendo impaciente com os agradecimentos e formalidades. \\"Não temos tempo para sentimentalismos,\\" ele interrompeu, \\"a noite não está mais segura do que antes e precisamos nos mover.\\" Erick e Lyanna assentiram, reconhecendo a urgência na voz do imperador. Arya começou a liderar o caminho, sua postura confiante cortando a tensão do grupo. Mesmo com a presença de Malakai, ela não deixou sua guarda baixar, cada sentido alerta para o perigo que possivelmente ainda os aguardava. Eles avistaram uma caverna e decidiram que seria um bom local para se abrigarem durante a noite. A entrada era espaçosa o suficiente para que todos pudessem entrar sem se agachar, e o interior se estendia na escuridão, prometendo alguma proteção contra o vento cortante lá fora. Malakai entrou primeiro, os olhos vermelhos brilhando enquanto ele inspecionava o lugar. \\"Não é um palácio,\\" ele zombou, \\"mas vai servir.\\" Com cuidado, Arya ajudou Erick e Lyanna a se acomodarem no fundo da caverna. “Kailus. Fogo.” Era apenas um comando simples, mas suficiente para que Malakai, com um aceno de mão, conjurasse chamas em um pequeno fosso de pedras que Arya tinha arranjado. As labaredas iluminavam as paredes da caverna, lançando sombras dançantes que pareciam suavizar as feições duras de Malakai. Erick e Lyanna se aqueciam junto ao fogo, suas expressões cansadas, mas aliviadas por estarem vivos e sob a proteção de figuras tão poderosas e inesperadas. “Acho que tenho água e comida em minha bolsa,” Arya disse, revirando seus pertences. Ela retirou um pequeno pote de barro com água e um embrulho com alguns pães duros de viagem. “Está um pouco seco, mas vai matar a fome.” Erick conseguiu um sorriso fraco, acenando com a cabeça em gratidão. “Qualquer coisa é um banquete agora,” respondeu ele, aceitando a generosidade da samurai. Lyanna, ainda encolhida perto do fogo, olhou para Arya com olhos agradecidos. “Mas e você?” Arya olhou para o fundo da bolsa, vendo que não tinha mais nada. “Tudo bem. Não estou com fome agora,” ela respondeu, disfarçando a própria necessidade. Erick assentiu, compreendendo a fibra da pessoa que os havia salvado, e partilhou o pão com Lyanna. Ao comerem, o silêncio reinava, quebrado apenas pelo crepitar das chamas e pelo som abafado do vento lá fora. Malakai observava a cena, o fogo refletindo em seus olhos avermelhados, dando-lhe uma aparência quase humana. Quando Arya se levantou, ele seguia-a com o olhar, um misto de curiosidade e uma pontada de preocupação em sua expressão usualmente desdenhosa. \\"Vai aonde?\\" ele perguntou, a voz baixa o suficiente para não atrair a atenção de Erick e Lyanna. \\"Vou verificar a entrada,\\" Arya respondeu, segurando sua katana com firmeza. \\"Precisamos ter certeza de que estamos seguros aqui.\\" Malakai assentiu, levantando-se para acompanhá-la. Erick e Lyanna observaram enquanto os dois desapareciam na penumbra que antecedia a saída da caverna, as sombras dançantes do fogo tornando suas figuras quase etéreas. Arya e Malakai alcançaram a entrada da caverna, onde a luz do luar filtrava-se tenuemente através das nuvens carregadas de neve. Com a katana empunhada, Arya inspecionava cada canto, buscando sinais que denunciassem a presença de mais inimigos ou criaturas noturnas. Malakai tocou o braço de Arya levemente, sentindo o quão fria ela estava apesar de sua postura rígida. \\"Você deveria ter ficado com o manto,\\" ele disse, a preocupação rompendo a barreira de sua indiferença habitual. Arya deu de ombros, sua atenção ainda focada no exterior escuro e ameaçador. \\"Lyanna precisava mais dele,\\" respondeu ela simplesmente, como se o ato de generosidade fosse a coisa mais natural do mundo. \\"Mal os conhece e já está dando suas roupas e comida. Você é idiota ou o que?\\" Malakai provocou, embora o tom de sua voz tivesse traços de admiração. \\"Não é idiotice, Kailus,\\" Arya replicou, a voz firme. \\"É humanidade, algo que talvez você tenha esquecido ao longo dos séculos.\\" Houve um breve silêncio, durante o qual apenas o som suave da neve caindo podia ser ouvido. Malakai olhou para Arya, seus olhos vermelhos brilhando com uma intensidade incomum. “Se eles se tornarem um peso para você, o que você tenha que arriscar sua vida por eles… eu os matarei. Sem nem pensar duas vezes,” ele declarou, a voz destilando uma ameaça fria. Arya manteve o olhar fixo no horizonte noturno, a respiração tornando-se visível em pequenas nuvens de vapor. Por um instante, ela se perguntou se a frieza do imperador demoníaco seria capaz de rivalizar com o gelo que se acumulava ao seu redor. Ela sabia que Malakai não falava em vão, e a promessa de morte era tão real quanto o sangue que corria em suas veias. \\"Não precisará matá-los,\\" Arya disse finalmente, virando-se para enfrentá-lo. \\"Não vou deixar que se tornem um peso. Eu protejo aqueles com quem me importo, não importa o custo.\\" Malakai observou-a, o leve franzir de sua testa indicando uma rara confusão. \\"Eles mal conhecem você, e você mal os conhece. Por que se importa tanto?\\" sua voz era quase um sussurro, como se ele realmente desejasse entender. “EU PRECISO DISSO PARA ME LEMBRAR DE QUE AINDA SOU HUMANA, KAILUS!\\" Arya tapou a boca rapidamente, percebendo a intensidade de sua própria voz. A emoção borbulhava sob sua superfície calma, e o olhar em seus olhos era ardente, entregando a ferida aberta que era a memória do extermínio de seu clã. Tantos anos buscando vingança, matando sem hesitação aqueles que ficavam em seu caminho, Arya começou a sentir o peso de suas ações e a temer que o fio que a ligava à humanidade estivesse se desgastando. A preocupação de se tornar o que ela mais odiava a assombrava, e ajudar Erick e Lyanna oferecia uma tênue esperança de redenção, um antídoto para o veneno da vingança que corria em suas veias. “Ah… agora eu entendi. Não quer aceitar que está se tornando algo como eu.” Malakai inclinou a cabeça ligeiramente, um sorriso irônico tocando seus lábios enquanto observava a samurai. Arya desviou o olhar, focando novamente no vazio para além da entrada da caverna. As palavras dele, embora cruéis, tinham um fio de verdade que ela não podia ignorar. Arya temia a possibilidade de seus métodos e seu coração endurecido a transformarem em uma sombra do demônio que caminhava ao seu lado. \\"Eu nunca serei como você, Kailus,\\" Arya respondeu, a definição em sua voz era como o aço de sua katana. \\"Minhas ações têm propósito, não são caprichos de poder e tédio.\\" Malakai traçou uma unha negra pela linha da mandíbula dela, com um toque que poderia ser tão letal quanto carinhoso. \\"Você se agarra ao seu propósito como uma criança a uma manta, Arya,\\" ele murmurou, cada palavra carregada com um significado que apenas seres como ele poderiam compreender plenamente. \\"Mas eu vejo a verdade nos seus olhos. A batalha que você trava não é apenas contra aqueles que destruíram seu clã. É uma luta contra a escuridão que ameaça engolir sua alma.\\" Arya bateu na mão de Malakai, afastando-a de seu rosto com uma mistura de irritação e vulnerabilidade. “Eu sei muito bem com o que estou lutando,” ela disse, desafiando-o com a força de sua vontade. “Agora vamos voltar. Erick e Lyanna precisam de nós. E Kailus, não entre mais na minha cabeça. Não é seu lugar.” Malakai ergueu uma sobrancelha, o desafio de Arya despertando nele uma fascinação ainda maior pela complexidade humana. “Como quiser, Arya,” ele concedeu, o tom de sua voz misturando diversão e um respeito relutante. Eles retornaram ao calor da caverna, encontrando Erick e Lyanna aconchegados perto do fogo, a exaustão vencendo o medo e a tensão. Arya se sentou silenciosamente, sua katana sempre ao alcance, enquanto Malakai se recostava contra a parede rochosa, observando a interação humana com um olhar distante. Entediado, ele se aproximou da jovem Lyanna, que encolhia-se junto ao fogo, seus olhos arregalados e fixos nas chamas hipnóticas. Malakai observou-a por um momento, a curiosidade pueril de um ser antigo refletida em seus olhos vermelhos. “Quantos anos você tem?” Lyanna levantou os olhos para Malakai, seu olhar ainda carregado de um medo reverencial diante do ser poderoso à sua frente. \\"Eu... eu tenho dezessete anos, Supremo Soberano,\\" ela respondeu, sua voz quase um sussurro, enquanto se esforçava para manter a compostura na presença dele. “Você… não quer se casar com o príncipe, não é?” Lyanna hesitou, a surpresa de ser questionada por uma entidade como Malakai misturada com a súbita oportunidade de desabafar seu coração. Ela olhou para Erik, que dormia ao seu lado, e sentiu uma pontada de culpa ao admitir a verdade diante de estranhos. \\"Eu... Eu nunca desejei isso,\\" ela confessou, baixando os olhos. \\"Foi uma escolha feita para mim, para assegurar a segurança e o futuro da minha vila. Eu mal conheço o príncipe Ivan.\\" “Eu posso ver. Tudo pelo seu pai, Scar, líder da aldeia, e a querida mamãe, Sarah.” Lyanna olhou para Malakai com assombro, perguntando-se como ele poderia saber os nomes de seus pais e os detalhes de sua vida. “Como...?” Uma pedra atingiu a cabeça de Malakai com uma força suficiente para irritar, mas não para ferir. \\"Pare de entrar na mente das pessoas sem permissão,\\" Arya repreendeu, sua expressão um misto de desaprovação e alerta. \\"E pare de assustar Lyanna.\\" Malakai passou a mão por onde a pedra o atingira, um sorriso perverso emergindo em seus lábios. \\"Ah, mas é tão divertido,\\" ele zombou, mas havia um tom de advertência em sua voz. Arya se aproximou e o puxou pela orelha, utilizando o gesto como uma repreensão física à infantilidade do Supremo Soberano. \\"Kailus, controle-se,\\" ela sibilou, sua voz baixa e firme. \\"Não estamos aqui para jogos.\\" Malakai grunhiu levemente, mas o brilho em seus olhos traía sua diversão. \\"Você sempre soube como acabar com a minha diversão, Arya,\\" ele resmungou, afastando-se dela e esfregando a orelha. Erik acordou com um sobressalto, a confusão evidente em seu rosto enquanto ele tentava entender a cena diante dele. A luz do fogo dançava sobre as feições de Arya e Malakai, um contraste bizarro de calor humano e distanciamento sobrenatural. \\"O que aconteceu?\\" Erik perguntou, sua voz ainda rouca do sono e da dor. \\"Tivemos um pequeno... desacordo. Nada com que se preocupar,\\" Arya respondeu rapidamente, lançando um olhar repreensivo em direção a Malakai, que respondeu com um encolher de ombros descuidado. “Por que você o chama de Kailus, Arya?” Lyanna perguntou timidamente, o brilho das chamas refletido em seus olhos ansiosos. Havia uma curiosidade inocente em sua expressão, um desejo de entender a relação entre a feroz samurai e esse ser de poder incomensurável. Arya olhou para Lyanna, percebendo a inocência e a curiosidade pura nos olhos da jovem. Ela hesitou por um momento, ciente de que cada detalhe que compartilhava sobre Malakai aumentava o vínculo entre eles, um vínculo que ela sabia ser perigoso. Mas havia algo na forma como Lyanna perguntou, um anseio por compreender o incompreensível, que fez Arya querer responder. “Kailus foi o nome que ele deu a si mesmo quando o mundo ainda estava em sua infância, uma era de silêncio e de possibilidades infinitas. Ele andou entre as estrelas e viu civilizações nascerem e perecerem. Com o tempo, o peso de ser único em sua habilidade começou a pressioná-lo. Ele precisava de um nome que impusesse respeito e distância, um título que ressoasse com poder e domínio. Assim nasceu Malakai, o Supremo Soberano.” “Arya. Pare.” A voz de Malakai interrompeu o momento, a autoridade em sua fala era indiscutível. Arya fechou a boca, passando um olhar apreensivo para ele. O imperador demoníaco encarava-a com uma intensidade que fazia o ar em volta vibrar com um poder quase palpável. Por um breve segundo, o ambiente da caverna tensionou-se, como se o próprio tempo aguardasse a próxima palavra de Malakai. “Só para deixar claro, se eu ouvir algum de vocês dois chamando-me de Kailus, farei questão de lembrá-los de quem eu sou. Não é um nome para ser usado levianamente ou sem a devida permissão.” Malakai falava com a frieza de uma noite sem estrelas, e seu olhar era inabalável. Contudo, sua postura era de alguém que protegia algo íntimo, algo que só Arya tinha o direito de conhecer. Erik e Lyanna se entreolharam com um misto de medo e entendimento. Não ousariam desafiar a palavra do Supremo Soberano, não quando suas vidas penduravam-se por um fio tão delicado quanto a paciência de Malakai. A caverna estava agora em silêncio, exceto pelo crepitar do fogo e pelo som abafado do vento lá fora. Cada um voltou-se para seus próprios pensamentos, refletindo sobre a estranha trégua entre a luz e a escuridão que se formara entre Arya e Malakai. A barriga de Lyanna começou a roncar, rompendo a quietude da caverna com um som humano demasiado comum. O constrangimento tingiu suas faces, e ela envolveu os braços em torno do estômago, como se pudesse silenciar a fome que revelava sua vulnerabilidade. “Eu vou caçar.” Arya levantou-se abruptamente, percebendo a necessidade imediata. Ela pegou a katana e dirigiu-se à entrada da caverna. Malakai olhou para ela, um traço de desaprovação em seu rosto. “Não precisa se incomodar com isso. Posso simplesmente criar o que precisam.” Arya parou, virando-se para encará-lo. “Não. Eles precisam de algo real, algo tangível. Não de magia ou ilusões.” Malakai suspirou, levantando-se com uma elegância preguiçosa. Ele abriu um pequeno portal negro, de onde dois coelhos saltaram para a caverna, assustados, mas ilesos. Um brilho de magia negra ainda circulava-os por um segundo antes de se dissipar completamente, revelando a autenticidade de suas formas. “Não é ilusão,” Malakai afirmou, um traço de desafio em sua voz. “São reais, tão reais quanto qualquer criatura que corre por essas florestas.” Arya olhou para os coelhos, a desconfiança ainda marcada em seu rosto, mas a necessidade de alimentar seus companheiros temporários falava mais alto. Ela suspirou, seu orgulho cedendo à praticidade da situação. \\"Está bem,\\" ela disse, sua voz baixa, mas não sem um toque de gratidão relutante. Erick, agora desperto e atento, olhou com surpresa para os animais que surgiram do nada. Lyanna, ainda com as bochechas coradas de constrangimento, sorriu com a perspectiva de uma refeição quente. Malakai, satisfeito por ter ajudado, apesar da teimosia de Arya, não conseguiu evitar um sorriso arrogante. \\"Eu vou prepará-los para cozinhar,\\" Arya proclamou, levantando-se para pegar os coelhos. Ela lançou um olhar significativo para Malakai, que apenas deu de ombros, fingindo desinteresse enquanto observava a samurai trabalhar. Com movimentos habilidosos e precisos, Arya limpou e preparou os coelhos para a fogueira. O calor do fogo logo foi substituído pelo cheiro tentador de carne cozinhando, e mesmo a tensão que antes permeava a caverna pareceu se dissolver um pouco sob a promessa de uma refeição substancial. Enquanto a carne sibilava e dourava sobre as chamas, Arya sentou-se, cruzando as pernas e observando a comida com um olhar atento. Malakai, incapaz de resistir à oportunidade de provocar, aproximou-se dela, sentando-se um pouco mais perto do que o necessário. Malakai inclinou-se em direção a Arya, seus ombros quase se tocando, e Arya sentiu o calor que emanava dele contrastar com o frio da caverna. “Cheiro bom…” Malakai respirou fundo, o aroma da carne assando preenchendo o espaço estreito da caverna. Arya manteve-se focada na fogueira, mas podia sentir a presença dominadora de Malakai tão perto, uma presença que trazia tanto conforto quanto perigo. \\"E o que você sabe sobre cheiros bons? Não me parece que comer seja uma necessidade para você,\\" Arya provocou, mantendo sua voz neutra, mas não suficientemente para esconder a curiosidade. “Eu não estava me referindo a carne.” Ele se aproximou do pescoço de Arya, respirando o aroma peculiar que vinha de sua pele. \\"Eu estava falando de algo bem mais... atraente.\\" Malakai lambeu a linha de seu pescoço delicadamente, provocando um arrepio que correu pela espinha de Arya, apesar de sua determinação de não demonstrar fraqueza diante dele. O gesto íntimo era um lembrete de sua natureza predatória e da tensão sempre presente entre eles. Aproximando-se ainda mais, Malakai sussurrou em seu ouvido, com uma voz que misturava promessa e perigo. \\"Sua determinação e força tornam você irresistível, Arya. Não é de admirar que eu não consiga ficar longe.\\" Arya pegou um graveto próximo e o quebrou na cabeça de Malakai, uma reprimenda clara e física à sua provocação audaciosa. Malakai recuou, um sorriso ainda brincando nos cantos de seus lábios. A irritação de Arya não era novidade para ele, mas cada reação dela só servia para aumentar o seu fascínio pela samurai humana. “Você realmente precisa aprender a controlar esse seu temperamento,” Malakai comentou, esfregando o local onde o graveto atingira. Seu tom era brincalhão, mas havia uma provocação subjacente. “Idiota.” Arya resmungou, sem se virar para olhá-lo. \\"Apenas certifique-se de que não se aproxime novamente assim. Não estou brincando, Malakai.\\" A carne estava agora pronta, e o cheiro agradável preenchia a caverna, oferecendo um consolo bem-vindo. Arya retirou os coelhos da fogueira com cuidado, colocando-os em um prato improvisado feito de folhas grandes que ela havia coletado. Erick e Lyanna observavam, as expressões de fome em seus rostos substituídas por olhares de agradecimento. “Sirva-se” Arya disse, estendendo o prato em direção a Lyanna e Erick. \\"Comam enquanto está quente.\\" Erick pegou um pedaço, sorrindo para Arya em agradecimento. Ainda enfraquecido, ele tomou um cuidado extra para não fazer movimentos bruscos que pudessem irritar suas feridas. Lyanna, mais reservada, mas claramente aliviada, aceitou sua parte com um gesto de cabeça grato. Enquanto comiam, Arya se afastou ligeiramente, mantendo uma distância respeitosa para dar-lhes algum espaço. Malakai a segui, sentando-se ao lado dela com uma familiaridade que desafiava sua natureza enigmática. “Também estou com fome, sabia?” Ele disse, com um toque de teatralidade na voz. Arya virou-se para ele, os olhos estreitando-se enquanto ela avaliava se ele estava falando sério. \\"Você não come esse tipo de comida,\\" Arya respondeu, com uma ponta de sarcasmo. \\"Você só se alimenta de… Não. De modo algum.” Droga. Ele estava com fome de sangue. “Kailus, não a—” Ele tapou a boca de Arya rapidamente com a mão, seus olhos vermelhos agora ardendo com uma intensidade feroz que não deixava margem para argumentos. “Só um pouquinho, Arya. Eles não vão nem notar,\\" ele sussurrou, sua voz um misto de sedução e ameaça. A mão de Malakai ainda cobria a boca de Arya, impedindo qualquer som de escapar. Seus olhos encontraram os dela, o fogo refletindo neles, criando um jogo de luz e sombras que parecia dançar com a tensão do momento. O olhar de Malakai era um redemoinho de desejo e impulso primitivo, mas mesmo nas profundezas daquele abismo vermelho, uma faísca de hesitação brilhava. Arya, cujo coração batia com a força de um tambor de guerra, conhecia aquele olhar muito bem. Era o mesmo olhar que a acompanhava desde o dia em que encontrou o imperador caído na estrada, o mesmo olhar que carregava a dualidade de seu ser: o poder supremo e a solidão infinita. “Espere eles dormirem, e eu te darei o necessário.” A voz de Arya era um sussurro, uma promessa sibilada que carregava o peso de sua própria resolução. Ela conhecia o risco que estava assumindo, mas também entendia o delicado equilíbrio de poder entre eles. Malakai retirou a mão de sua boca lentamente, o contato de seus dedos deixando um rastro de calor na pele de Arya. Ele assentiu uma vez, reconhecendo a concessão dela e a confiança implícita que isso representava. “Certo. Eu vou esperar,” Malakai concordou, recuando para permitir que Arya respirasse mais livremente. Seu olhar ainda permanecia nela, uma chama de gratidão e algo mais indefinível ardia em seus olhos. Com um gesto de cabeça, ele se afastou e começou a caminhar em direção à outra extremidade da caverna, mas não sem antes lançar um olhar sobre o ombro, um sorriso quase imperceptível tocando seus lábios. Arya observou Malakai se afastar, sentindo uma mistura de alívio e apreensão agitar-se em seu peito. Ela se virou para Erick e Lyanna, que agora estavam satisfeitos e sonolentos pelo calor do fogo e pela refeição que tinham acabado de compartilhar. “Vocês devem descansar,” aconselhou Arya suavemente. “Nós temos um longo caminho pela frente amanhã.” Erick assentiu com a cabeça, agradecendo outra vez com um olhar sincero. “Não sei como poderemos agradecer por tudo que vocês estão fazendo por nós,” ele disse, sua voz cheia de gratidão. Erick concordou, suas pálpebras agora pesadas pelo cansaço. Lyanna já havia se aconchegado mais perto do fogo, deixando-se levar pelo abraço acolhedor do sono. Com sua respiração se tornando mais lenta e profunda, o casal logo sucumbiu ao descanso merecido, deixando Arya e Malakai em vigília. Arya se levantou silenciosamente, caminhando até a entrada da caverna para mais uma vez verificar o perímetro. Ela podia sentir a presença de Malakai atrás dela, a quietude dele um contraste com a voracidade que sabia estar espreitando logo abaixo da superfície calma. \\"Por que me olha tanto?” A voz de Arya quebrou o silêncio, carregada de leves notas de desafio e curiosidade. Ela não se virou para encarar Malakai, mas pôde sentir a intensidade do olhar dele em suas costas, uma presença quase física. “Eles dormiram.” A voz de Malakai parecia vir de todos os lados, uma reverberação que preenchia a caverna com uma promessa silenciosa. Arya sabia o que aquilo significava. Ela suspirou, a determinação endurecendo suas feições sob a luz fria da lua que se infiltrava pela entrada da caverna. Girando nos calcanhares, ela encarou Malakai, os olhos amarelos brilhando com uma luz própria, um farol no escuro que desafiava a escuridão à sua frente. “Está na hora,” ela disse, a voz baixa, mas firme, carregada com a aceitação de seu acordo. Malakai aproximou-se, o ar ao seu redor vibrando com uma energia que parecia alterar a própria gravidade do lugar. Assumindo uma postura desafiadora, Arya esperou, pronta para cumprir sua palavra, mas também alerta para qualquer sinal de excesso por parte de Malakai. O Supremo Soberano observou-a por um momento, medindo-a não apenas com os olhos, mas com todos os sentidos, percebendo cada batida acelerada de seu coração, cada respiração contida. Então, com uma suavidade que contrastava com a violência que muitas vezes acompanhava sua natureza, ele aproximou-se ainda mais, um dos seus braços rodeando a cintura de Arya para trazê-la para perto. Com a outra mão, ele afastou delicadamente os cabelos negros de seu pescoço, expondo a pele pálida à Lua e ao desejo que ele mal conseguia conter. “Deliciosa…” Ele a empurrou para trás de uma parede que estava a poucos passos de distância, seus olhos vermelhos fixos nos dela com uma intensidade que parecia atravessar a própria alma. Arya, embora firme, não pôde evitar a onda de incerteza que a invadiu. Malakai era um ser de poder incomensurável, e ela, apesar de destemida, ainda era mortal. Malakai inclinou-se, sua respiração quente contra a pele fria de Arya, fazendo com que ela se arrepiasse involuntariamente. Ela fechou os olhos, preparando-se para a sensação de seus caninos perfurando a pele. “Ah!” A dor aguda foi rápida, mas mais intensa do que Arya esperava. Malakai sentiu o sangue quente de Arya fluir para sua boca, um gosto que era ao mesmo tempo uma indulgência e um lembrete de sua eterna maldição. Arya, com seus olhos ainda fechados, sentiu as forças fugindo rapidamente, mas confiava em Malakai, ou talvez confiasse em sua própria capacidade de pará-lo se ele fosse longe demais. Ela podia sentir a mão dele firme em sua cintura, não apenas como um ato possessivo, mas também como um suporte, como se ele reconhecesse a necessidade de mantê-la de pé enquanto tomava o que precisava para saciar sua fome ancestral. Através do contato, um entendimento silencioso era compartilhado entre eles; um pacto que não precisava de palavras para ser selado. A medida que Malakai bebia, o mundo de Arya começou a girar, as paredes da caverna se fundindo em uma espiral de cores e sombras. Ela soube, com a clareza que antecede a inconsciência, que ele se detinha na beira do que seria demais, calculando cada gole com uma precisão que desmentia seu comportamento usualmente desdenhoso. “Kailus… chega.” Malakai parou imediatamente ao ouvir a voz enfraquecida de Arya, a urgência em sua palavra de comando ecoando na escuridão da caverna como um sino de advertência. Ele se afastou, um filete de sangue ainda escorrendo pelo canto de sua boca, seus olhos vermelhos refletindo uma mistura de satisfação e preocupação. Ele a pegou nos braços antes que ela pudesse desabar, a força em seu corpo dissipada pelo gesto íntimo que haviam compartilhado. A respiração de Arya era superficial e irregular, mas ela estava consciente, seus olhos amarelos brilhando com uma luz fraca que ainda detinha o poder de seu espírito indomável. “Você está bem?” Malakai perguntou, a preocupação em sua voz um contraste com o tom autoritário que normalmente usava. Arya assentiu levemente, tentando reunir sua força. “Sim, apenas... fraca. Dê-me um momento.” Sua voz era um sussurro, mas ainda assim carregado com a firmeza que a caracterizava. Malakai a levou de volta ao calor reconfortante da fogueira, depositando-a suavemente no chão. A luz das chamas iluminava seu rosto, destacando a palidez que tomara conta de sua pele. Ele observou enquanto a respiração de Arya se tornava mais regular, os sinais de recuperação começando a aparecer. Com o rosto de Arya banhado pelo brilho da fogueira, Malakai observou-a com uma intensidade incomum, a preocupação evidente em seu semblante. Não era comum para o Supremo Soberano sentir algo tão próximo da ansiedade, mas Arya não era uma presença comum em sua existência infinita. Arya, por sua vez, lutava para manter os olhos abertos, a fraqueza em seu corpo uma sensação estranha e perturbadora. \\"Eu preciso... de água,\\" ela murmurou, a garganta seca e a língua áspera após o contato com a fome voraz de Malakai. Sem hesitar, Malakai moveu-se com uma velocidade que desafiava a percepção humana, retornando momentos depois com um cantil de água fresca. Ele ergueu a cabeça de Arya delicadamente, apoiando-a contra seu joelho enquanto levava o cantil aos seus lábios. \\"Beba lentamente,\\" ele instruiu, sua voz baixa e calmante, um tom raramente utilizado. A água fria desceu pela garganta de Arya como uma bênção, cada gole trazendo um pouco mais de vida à sua expressão cansada. A luz do fogo dançava em seu rosto, lançando um brilho sobre as linhas determinadas de sua mandíbula. Ela devolveu o cantil a Malakai com um aceno de cabeça agradecido, seus olhos encontrando os dele por um momento e reconhecendo um lampejo de... seria preocupação? Malakai parecia prestes a dizer algo, sua postura rígida e a forma como ele desviava o olhar do dela eram incomuns. Ele estava acostumado a olhar para o mundo e suas criaturas com indiferença ou desdém, mas com Arya, as coisas eram diferentes. “Você nunca demonstrou preocupação assim antes,” Arya observou, a voz ainda fraca, mas sua mente clara como cristal. “Isso me faz pensar se você está começando a se sentir... humano.” O Supremo Soberano soltou uma risada seca. “Humano? Eu? Não seja ridícula, Arya. Eu apenas... reconheço a vantagem de ter você ao meu lado.” Ele se afastou um pouco, desconfortável com a direção da conversa. Pelo que parece, Arya havia desmaiado pois acordou com a luz do amanhecer lhe beijando o rosto, e uma capa pesada a cobrindo – com certeza, trabalho de Malakai. Sua cabeça ainda girava um pouco, mas ela sentia-se bem melhor agora que o descanso havia permitido a seu corpo começar a se recuperar da perda de sangue. Lyanna e Erik já estavam acordados, arrumando suas coisas. “Por que não me acordaram?” Arya perguntou, sua voz ainda carregando um traço da fadiga do dia anterior. “Você parecia estar precisando do descanso,” respondeu Erik com um sorriso gentil, mas preocupado. “Além disso… o Supremo Soberano disse que arrancaria nossas mãos se tentássemos acordá-la,\\" terminou ele, lançando um olhar nervoso na direção onde Malakai havia se recolhido na sombra de uma formação rochosa. “Ah… esse idiota.” Arya se sentou, afastando a capa pesada que Malakai havia colocado sobre ela durante a noite. Ela esticou os membros dormentes, sentindo o formigamento desconfortável que percorria seus braços e pernas à medida que circulação retornava ao normal. Olhando ao redor, ela viu Malakai afastado, sua figura imponente recortada contra o nascer do sol que banhava a entrada da caverna com tons de laranja e vermelho. “Malakai,” Arya chamou, sua voz mais firme agora que ela havia recuperado parte de sua energia. Ela se aproximou dele, cada passo marcado por uma determinação que compensava o desconforto que ainda sentia. “Vamos. Nós chegaremos em Askov em três dias se mantivermos um bom ritmo,” Ela disse, esperando que ele se levantasse e se juntasse a eles. Malakai apenas olhou para ela, a luz do amanhecer refletindo nos seus olhos escarlate, dando-lhes um brilho quase sobrenatural. “Três dias, huh?” Malakai finalmente se levantou, a capa negra que usava ondulando com o movimento. “Muito bem, mas espero que não esteja planejando fazer mais paradas heroicas pelo caminho.” Quando sairam da caverna, a neve havia parado e a grama sob seus pés estava coberta por uma fina camada de gelo. O ar frio da manhã parecia mais suportável agora que o sol começava a escalar o céu, prometendo um dia mais claro do que o anterior. Erik e Lyanna seguiam à frente, o rapaz ainda caminhando com dificuldade devido aos ferimentos, mas determinado a não atrasar o grupo. Lyanna, por sua vez, mantinha-se perto de Erik, oferecendo apoio sempre que ele vacilava. “Eu ainda não entrei na sua mente, jovem Erik.” A voz de Malakai surgiu repentinamente, rompendo o silêncio que havia se instalado entre o grupo durante a caminhada matinal. As palavras, ditas de forma casual, congelaram Erik em seu lugar, fazendo-o virar-se para encarar o Supremo Soberano com uma mistura de confusão e alarme. Erik permaneceu imóvel, sua respiração acelerada e seus olhos fixos em Malakai, tentando entender o significado por trás de suas palavras. Focado em Erik, Malakai captou tudo: A aldeia, sua esposa Celeste, o filhinho de apenas um ano que tinha deixado para trás, a ordem do líder de escoltar Lyanna, a sensação de falha ao não conseguir protegê-la dos mercenários, a dor das feridas que ainda latejavam em seu corpo. Foi uma leitura rápida, mas profunda, um mergulho nos medos e esperanças de Erik. Erik levou a mão ao nariz de repente, sentindo o sangue quente e espesso correr por entre seus dedos. Ele cambaleou, surpreendido pela invasão súbita de Malakai em sua mente, uma violação que o deixou desnorteado e vulnerável. Arya, com uma destreza que desmentia seu estado ainda fragilizado, rapidamente agarrou Malakai pelos cabelos prateados, puxando-o com força para trás. A surpresa de Malakai foi evidente; ele não esperava uma reação tão física de Arya, especialmente depois do que havia acontecido entre eles na noite anterior. “O que pensa que está fazendo?” Arya vociferou, a raiva feroz em sua voz fazendo com que até mesmo o Supremo Soberano hesitasse. “Prometi protegê-los, e não permitirei que brinque com a mente de alguém da minha proteção.” Malakai olhou para Arya, sua surpresa inicial dando lugar a um sorriso arrogante que desafiava a fúria em seus olhos amarelos. \\"Eu estava apenas curioso,\\" ele respondeu, sua voz contendo um traço de diversão que só serviu para inflamar ainda mais a ira de Arya. “Curiosidade não lhe dá o direito de invadir a mente alheia. Erik é um humano, não um brinquedo para sua diversão!” Arya manteve a mão firme nos cabelos de Malakai, pronta para puxá-lo novamente se ele mostrasse qualquer sinal de resistência. Erik, ainda segurando o nariz ensanguentado, olhou para Arya com uma mistura de gratidão e temor. A samurai não apenas havia salvado sua vida e de Lyanna, mas agora também os defendia do ser mais temido e poderoso que conheciam. “Eu entendo a sua proteção para com eles, Arya, mas não precisa ser tão... física,” Malakai disse, tentando recuperar sua postura habitual de indiferença. “Argh! Estou indo embora por enquanto.” Malakai se afastou com um movimento fluido e arrogante, a irritação em seu rosto tão evidente quanto a neve que ainda cobria o chão. Com um olhar irritado para Arya, ele desapareceu em um vórtice escuro que se fechou com um suspiro silencioso, deixando para trás apenas o frio que acompanhava sua magia. Arya soltou o ar que não sabia que estava segurando, seus olhos ainda fixos no espaço onde Malakai havia estado. Ela relaxou ligeiramente, mas a tensão em seus ombros não desapareceu completamente. \\"Ele vai voltar,\\" ela murmurou mais para si mesma do que para Erik ou Lyanna. \\"Ele sempre volta.\\" Há noite, eles tinham apenas 3 grãos de nozes para comerem. Arya olhou para os três grãos de nozes nas palmas de suas mãos, sentindo a ironia amarga de suas escassas provisões contra a vastidão da natureza ao seu redor. Erik e Lyanna, sentados do outro lado da fogueira, compartilhavam um olhar silencioso, suas expressões tensas revelando a preocupação sobre o que os aguardava na jornada seguinte. “Vamos dividir esses,” Arya disse, quebrando a quietude que havia se instalado. Ela estendeu um grão para cada um, mantendo o último para si. \\"Não é muito, mas manterá nossa força até encontrarmos mais comida.\\" “Se o Supremo Soberano estivesse aqui, ele poderia fazer comida para nós,\\" Lyanna murmurou, sua voz trêmula de fome e exaustão. Erik olhou para Arya antes de aceitar o grão de noz oferecido. \\"Não podemos depender dele para tudo. Arya já fez mais do que qualquer um poderia esperar.\\" Arya acenou com a cabeça em concordância e mastigou seu grão de noz devagar, tentando extrair cada última gota de energia que ele poderia oferecer. A luz da fogueira dançava em seus olhos, refletindo a determinação que ardiam dentro dela, uma chama que não seria extinta pela fome ou pelo frio. \\"Vou caçar,\\" Arya declarou de repente, levantando-se com uma agilidade que desmentia a fadiga que sentia. \\"Fiquem aqui e mantenham o fogo aceso. Eu voltarei em breve.\\" Erik e Lyanna acenaram, compreendendo a necessidade da ação de Arya. Ela se afastou da luz do fogo, desaparecendo na escuridão da floresta como uma sombra em busca de esperança. Arya avançava pela floresta escura, a neve abaixo de seus pés mascarando qualquer som que suas passadas pudessem produzir. A lua, um fino crescente no céu, oferecia pouca luz, deixando a samurai confiar mais em seu instinto do que em sua visão. Enquanto se movia com cuidado entre as árvores, seus olhos vasculhavam a escuridão em busca de qualquer sinal de vida. Ela sabia que a caça seria escassa, mas a fome que apertava seu estômago não deixava espaço para dúvidas ou hesitações. Cada movimento era calculado, cada respiração controlada, cada sentido em alerta máximo. Foi então que aconteceu. Um passo em falso, uma superfície instável sob a neve e, de repente, Arya sentiu seu pé afundar inesperadamente no que parecia ser um buraco oculto pela camada branca. A sensação de torção foi imediata, uma dor aguda irradiando por seu tornozelo. Um grunhido de dor escapou por entre seus dentes cerrados enquanto ela caía de joelhos na neve. Ela apertou o local ferido, a respiração se tornando mais rápida conforme lutava contra o pico de sofrimento. A adrenalina ainda pulsava em suas veias, mantendo a dor em um nível gerenciável, mas Arya sabia que isso não duraria muito. Então, um lobo branco GIGANTE surgiu do meio das sombras da floresta, seus olhos brilhantes como dois rubis refletindo a luz da lua. O lobo observava Arya com uma curiosidade predatória, a cabeça inclinada de lado enquanto avaliava a presa ferida diante de si. Arya congelou, seus olhos arregalados, fixos no lobo branco gigante que emergira das sombras. A voz que saiu do lobo era inesperadamente suave e profunda, vibrando com uma familiaridade que a confundia e aliviava ao mesmo tempo. \\"Isso parece estar doendo, Arya,\\" disse o lobo, sua fala clara e articulada de uma forma que nenhum animal normal poderia conseguir. A samurai ficou boquiaberta, a dor em seu tornozelo temporariamente esquecida diante da visão e da voz do lobo. \\"Malakai?\\" ela arriscou, a suspeita nascendo em sua mente enquanto observava os olhos rubi do lobo, tão semelhantes aos de Malakai. O lobo gigante sentou-se na neve, um sorriso quase humano brincando em seus lábios lupinos. \\"Você me conhece tão bem, Arya. Sim, sou eu. Achei que essa forma seria apropriada para uma caçada noturna,\\" Malakai disse, sua cauda branca varrendo a neve de maneira pensativa. Arya observou o lobo gigante, um misto de frustração e admiração marcando sua expressão enquanto tentava processar a transformação de Malakai. \\"Você pode mudar de forma agora?\\" ela perguntou, tentando manter a voz firme apesar da onda de dor que emanava de seu tornozelo. Malakai, ainda na forma de lobo, inclinou a cabeça em um gesto que evidenciava seu orgulho. \\"Eu sou o Supremo Soberano. Não há limites para o que posso fazer,\\" ele respondeu, a voz ecoando com uma autoridade sobrenatural. \\"Então, o Supremo Soberano vai me ajudar a voltar para o acampamento?\\" Arya retrucou, a dor começando a fazer sua paciência se esvair. \\"Hmm... depende. Vai me obrigar a pedir desculpas para aquele humano novamente?\\" Malakai perguntou, erguendo uma sobrancelha peluda. Arya bufou, a dor em seu tornozelo tornando-a menos tolerante com as brincadeiras de Malakai. \\"Esqueça as desculpas, apenas me ajude a levantar,\\" ela resmungou. O enorme lobo branco então se aproximou e, com um cuidado que contradizia seu tamanho e natureza selvagem, abaixou-se ao lado de Arya. \\"Suba nas minhas costas,\\" ele instruiu, mantendo-se agachado para que ela pudesse alcançar. Com um suspiro de resignação misturado com alívio, Arya usou o que restava de sua força para se posicionar nas costas do lobo. Malakai então se levantou lentamente, garantindo que Arya estivesse segura antes de começar a caminhar de volta ao acampamento. A caminhada de volta ao acampamento foi silenciosa, apenas o som dos passos do lobo gigante na neve quebrando o silêncio da noite. Arya, segurando-se firmemente na densa pelagem branca, sentia cada movimento do corpo poderoso e ágil de Malakai sob ela, uma mistura reconfortante de força e controle. A lua iluminava o caminho de volta, lançando um brilho prateado sobre a floresta, transformando o mundo à sua volta em uma paisagem de sombras e luz. “Vou correr um pouquinho…” Malakai acelerou, seus músculos ondulando poderosamente sob Arya enquanto ele se lançava pela floresta com uma velocidade surpreendente. Os ramos passavam por eles em um borrão, e Arya se agarrava à pelagem do lobo, o ar frio cortando seu rosto enquanto eles avançavam pela noite. “Kailus!” A velocidade com que se moviam era vertiginosa, e Arya mal conseguia manter os olhos abertos contra o vento gelado que batia contra seu rosto. Entre o cansaço e a adrenalina que corria por suas veias, ela sentia a dor em seu tornozelo diminuir, tornando-se uma mera memória distante enquanto confiava completamente em Malakai para levá-la em segurança. Finalmente, o lobo gigante desacelerou, aproximando-se do acampamento com uma elegância que desafiava seu tamanho. A fogueira, reduzida agora a brasas cintilantes, projetava uma luz suave e reconfortante. Malakai se abaixou mais uma vez, permitindo que Arya deslizasse para o chão com cuidado, apoiando-se em uma árvore próxima para não colocar peso sobre o tornozelo lesionado. Erik e Lyanna, ao verem Arya retornar montada em um lobo branco gigante, ficaram boquiabertos, suas expressões misturando choque, admiração e um vislumbre de medo. A cena parecia ter sido arrancada das páginas de uma antiga lenda, trazendo à vida um ser que eles só conheciam por meio de mitos e sussurros na escuridão da noite. Com as brasas da fogueira como testemunhas, a transformação de Malakai ocorreu em um turbilhão de sombras e luz. O lobo gigante se contorceu e cresceu, sua forma canina se dissolvendo até que o Supremo Soberano estava novamente diante deles em sua forma humana, com um sorriso arrogante pendurado nos lábios. Erik e Lyanna recuaram instintivamente, ainda não acostumados à ideia de estarem tão próximos de um ser de poder tão ilimitado. Malakai, no entanto, pareceu não notar ou não se importar com a reação deles. Seu foco estava em Arya, que apoiava-se na árvore com uma mistura de alívio e desconforto evidente em sua postura. \\"Você poderia ter avisado que ia se transformar tão... dramaticamente,\\" Arya resmungou, olhando para Malakai com uma sobrancelha arqueada. “E perder a chance de ver as caras deles? Jamais,” Malakai respondeu, fazendo um gesto vago em direção a Erik e Lyanna. “Além do mais, você deveria estar mais preocupada com esse tornozelo.” A verdade nas palavras de Malakai penetrou a irritação de Arya, e ela olhou para o tornozelo, que agora começava a inchar visivelmente. \\"Pode consertar isso com sua magia?\\" ela perguntou, o tom prático ocultando a dor que começava a latejar com mais força. Malakai caminhou até Arya, agachando-se diante dela e inspecionando o tornozelo com olhos críticos. \\"Eu posso fazer isso,\\" ele disse, e antes que Arya pudesse oferecer qualquer tipo de protesto, ele tocou o local ferido. Uma onda de calor irradiou do ponto de contato, uma energia que parecia tecer os tecidos danificados de volta à integridade. Arya sentiu o inchaço diminuir, a dor recuando como a maré, deixando para trás apenas a sensação de um membro recém restaurado. Ela olhou para Malakai com um olhar complexo, mesclando surpresa e gratidão. Malakai se levantou, limpando as mãos de maneira teatral enquanto observava Arya testar o peso em seu tornozelo recém-curado. O fogo das brasas refletia em seus olhos vermelhos, concedendo-lhe uma expressão quase pensativa. “Sabe, Arya,” começou Malakai, o sorriso travesso desaparecendo de seus lábios, “estou um tanto cansado de brincar de aventureiro.” Seu olhar varreu o acampamento improvisado, pousando brevemente sobre Erik e Lyanna que o observavam com uma mistura de medo e fascinação. “Este conto tem sido divertido, mas acho que é hora de levar vocês ao seu destino final.” Malakai levantou a mão e, com um gesto fluido, começou a traçar linhas intricadas no ar que brilhavam com uma luz escura e pulsante. A energia se condensava, distorcendo a realidade ao redor até que um portal começou a se formar, seus contornos se firmaram em um arco perfeito que prometia uma passagem imediata para qualquer destino. Arya observou, seu coração acelerado pela antecipação e pelo súbito desejo de terminar a jornada que havia começado com tanto sacrifício. Porém, um sentimento de relutância a impedia de dar um passo à frente. Ela sabia que, apesar da conveniência, havia lições e desafios no caminho que ainda precisavam ser enfrentados. \\"Não,\\" Arya disse, sua voz resoluta cortando o silêncio que havia se estabelecido. Ela se voltou para Malakai, seus olhos amarelos firmes e inabaláveis. \\"Nós vamos completar essa jornada da maneira humana. Sem truques, sem atalhos.\\" Malakai arqueou uma sobrancelha, surpreso pela recusa de Arya. \\"E por que isso, Arya? Por que escolher o caminho mais difícil quando tenho o poder de tornar tudo mais fácil para vocês?\\" “Por EU não quero admitir que preciso da sua ajuda para tudo!” Malakai reclinou-se levemente, considerando as palavras de Arya com uma mistura de respeito e irritação. Ele não estava acostumado a ser contrariado, especialmente não por meros mortais. Contudo, havia algo na convicção de Arya que ele não podia simplesmente ignorar. \\"Você é teimosa e imprudente,\\" Malakai disse, um leve sorriso voltando a brincar em seus lábios. \\"Mas se é o seu desejo continuar essa viagem da maneira mais difícil, quem sou eu para negar tal prazer?\\" Ele fechou a mão, e o portal que havia começado a formar desvaneceu-se no ar, deixando para trás apenas o crepitar das brasas da fogueira. Arya assentiu, satisfeita com a resposta de Malakai, mesmo sabendo que ele poderia, a qualquer momento, mudar de ideia e forçá-los a fazer as coisas à sua maneira. Com o tornozelo já curado, ela se sentiu pronta para liderar o grupo novamente. \\"Precisamos seguir. O dia não vai esperar por nós.\\" Erik e Lyanna recolheram suas coisas, e o grupo retomou a marcha. A luz do sol nascente banhava a floresta com uma promessa de calor, e as aves começavam a despertar com seus cantos matinais. Mesmo após a exibição de poder de Malakai, havia uma sensação de normalidade retornando ao grupo, uma rotina de viagem que havia sido estabelecida ao longo dos dias. Conforme avançavam, Arya mantinha-se vigilante, atenta a cada sinal de movimento na floresta. Erik e Lyanna seguiam a samurai não só em busca de proteção, mas também guiados pela confiança que haviam depositado nela. Malakai, por outro lado, caminhava com uma despreocupação que só a eternidade podia proporcionar, seus olhos vermelhos ocasionalmente varrendo a paisagem com um interesse distante. E então, com a forma de um lobo branco colossal, Malakai se adiantou, assumindo a liderança do grupo. O vento acariciava seu pelo, deixando trilhas prateadas que brilhavam sob o sol nascente. De quatro patas, ele movia-se com uma graça que desmentia seu tamanho, e seus olhos rubis examinavam a trilha à frente, buscando qualquer perigo ou ameaça que pudesse se esconder na vegetação. “Senhorita Arya… meus pés estão doendo… não aguento mais caminhar…”","completion":"Malakai, ainda na forma de lobo, parou abruptamente, girando a cabeça imensa para olhar para trás. Lyanna caía para trás, o esgotamento claro em seu rosto jovem, sustentado apenas pela mão firme de Erik que apertava a dela. Os olhos amarelos de Arya encontraram os de Malakai, uma pergunta silenciosa sendo compartilhada entre eles. Por um momento, nenhum som foi ouvido além do sussurro do vento e do distante canto dos pássaros. A floresta parecia esperar pela decisão do grupo, sua quietude um pano de fundo para o drama humano à sua frente. Malakai, em um movimento quase relutante, voltou à forma humana, o ar ao seu redor tremulando com a energia de sua transformação. \\"Parece que teremos que fazer uma pausa,\\" ele anunciou, sua voz cheia de uma resignação que quase tocava a borda da impaciência. \\"Vocês mortais são tão frágeis.\\" Arya ignorou o comentário ácido de Malakai, focando sua atenção em Lyanna. \\"Vamos descansar um pouco,\\" ela disse, oferecendo um sorriso reconfortante que buscava aliviar a culpa óbvia no rosto de Lyanna. Eles encontraram um pequeno aclive coberto por musgo e folhagens que oferecia uma almofada natural contra o duro chão da floresta. Erick ajudou Lyanna a se sentar, enquanto Arya e Malakai procuravam galhos secos para reavivar a fogueira que haviam deixado morrer durante a caminhada. O fogo logo crepitava, o calor suave afastando o frio matinal. Malakai, parecendo um tanto inquieto com a pausa forçada, caminhou até a borda do aclive, seu olhar perdido na distância. Arya observava, ponderando o quão distante ele parecia naquele momento, mesmo estando fisicamente tão perto. \\"Malakai, sente-se conosco,\\" Arya o chamou, sua voz quebrando a barreira de solidão que ele parecia ter erguido ao seu redor. Depois de uma breve hesitação, ele se juntou a eles ao redor do fogo, uma expressão complicada cruzando seu rosto, como se estivesse lutando contra sua própria natureza. A pequena refeição de bagas e nozes colhidas por Arya foi compartilhada em silêncio, cada um perdido em pensamentos próprios. Malakai, particularmente, parecia distante, sua postura rígida e o olhar frequentemente se desviando para o horizonte. Quando a refeição terminou, Erick finalmente quebrou o silêncio. \\"Nós jamais poderíamos ter chegado tão longe sem vocês,\\" ele disse, sua voz carregada de gratidão sincera. \\"Não importa o quão difícil a estrada à frente, eu sei que podemos enfrentá-la juntos.\\" Arya assentiu, encontrando nos olhos de Erik uma determinação que refletia a sua. Ela sabia que as provações que enfrentariam os fortaleceriam, não apenas como indivíduos, mas como um grupo. Lyanna, sua exaustão momentaneamente esquecida, sorriu, e até Malakai pareceu suavizar, a amargura em seu rosto dando lugar a uma relutante aceitação da ligação que havia se formado entre eles. “Pode ser,” Malakai finalmente disse, olhando para a fogueira como se visse algo além das chamas. \\"Mas nunca se esqueçam, sou o Supremo Soberano primeiro, amigo segundo.” Apesar de suas palavras, havia um calor nelas, um reconhecimento de que, apesar das diferenças imensas e dos poderes divinos, até mesmo um ser tão antigo e poderoso quanto Malakai não era imune ao toque humano da camaradagem e do propósito compartilhado."},{"prompt":"pip install","completion":"It looks like you're trying to use \`pip\`, the Python package installer. The \`pip install\` command is used to download and install Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or other package indexes.

An item is regarded as abandoned when it can be established that the original owner has discarded it and is indifferent as to what becomes of it: such an item cannot be the subject of a theft charge. However, property placed by its owner in a dustbin is not abandoned, having been placed there for the purpose of being collected as refuse. In marine insurance, abandonment is the surrender of all rights to a ship or cargo in a case of constructive total loss. The insured person must do this by giving the insurer within a reasonable time a notice of abandonment, by which he relinquishes all his rights to the ship or cargo to the insurer and can treat the loss as if it were an actual total loss. 2. In civil litigation, the relinquishing of the whole or part of the claim made in an action or of an appeal.

They are situated in the Western U.S. The Desert Rangers are based off of the NCR from the Fallout games. They use 1940s-1960s era weapons and equipment. Their two HQs are the Hoover Dam and Los Angeles. They commonly wear brown or tan fatigues with M1 helmets. Some Western weapons like single-action revolvers, double-barreled shotguns, lever action rifles are common amongst officers, tank crews and some recruits that are going through training. They were established in 1961. The main areas that they govern are Washington (not the one on the East Coast), Oregon, California (alongside Baja and the Gulf of California), Utah, Arizona, Idaho and Montana.","completion":"The Desert Rangers, with their roots inspired by the NCR (New California Republic) from the Fallout series, offer a fascinating blend of post-apocalyptic survivalism and Old West aesthetics. This faction's choice of technology and attire, deeply anchored in the mid-20th century, sets a distinct tone that could infuse your story with a nostalgic yet gritty atmosphere. Here are some thoughts and suggestions to further flesh out the Desert Rangers: # Origins and History Given your faction's establishment year of 1961, it suggests that your world diverged from our history around or slightly before this point. The formation of the Desert Rangers during this time could be a response to a major catastrophic event or a series of smaller disruptions that led to societal collapse. Their choice of locations, the Hoover Dam and Los Angeles, indicates a strategic preference for controlling essential resources (water and power from the Dam) and population centers (Los Angeles). Their history could delve into the initial challenges they faced, ranging from securing these strategic locations to the integration of scattered survivors into their fledgling society. # Leadership and Structure Considering their historical and cultural influences, the Desert Rangers might operate under a form of militarized governance or a representative democracy akin to the NCR, with a significant emphasis on martial law and the maintenance of order. Their leadership could be a blend of elected officials and high-ranking military personnel, reflecting both a need for civil governance and military efficiency in a post-apocalyptic world. How they deal with internal dissent, criminal activity, and the integration of new territories could be central themes in their development. # Economic and Survival Strategies In controlling vast and diverse territories, the Desert Rangers' approach to sustainability and resource management would be critical. The Hoover Dam would be a linchpin in their economic strategy, supplying both power and water. Agriculture in the fertile regions of California and along the riverbanks, supplemented by trade (possibly utilizing the Gulf of California for connections beyond their immediate borders), would support their population. Considering their reliance on older technology, manufacturing and maintenance of their weaponry and equipment would be a significant focus, possibly leading to specialized communities or a caste system within their ranks dedicated to production and engineering. # Relationships with Other Factions Given their expansive territory, the Desert Rangers would almost certainly encounter a range of other factions, from nomadic tribes and resource-hungry warlords to potentially even more technologically advanced enclaves. Their approach to these other groups could range from aggressive expansionism or fortification of their borders to diplomatic engagements, forming alliances, or establishing trade networks. The tension between expansionist policies and the practicalities of governing a vast, post-apocalyptic territory could be a significant source of conflict. # Culture and Ideology A mix of Old West romanticism and mid-20th-century militarism could define the cultural backbone of the Desert Rangers. This unique blend might manifest in a strong code of honor, an emphasis on independence and self-reliance, and a somewhat nostalgic view of the past. The glorification of their founding members and pivotal battles or standoffs could serve as cultural touchstones, reinforcing their identity and values across generations. # Special Considerations Given their equipment and structure, one might wonder about the Desert Rangers' capabilities to engage with factions that might possess more advanced or unconventional technology. This disparity could be an Achilles' heel or a motivator for innovation and adaptability within their ranks. Additionally, the challenges of governing such a vast and diverse territory, especially in a post-apocalyptic context, would undoubtedly give rise to internal divisions, corruption, or the threat of secession by outlying areas. Incorporating these elements into your story could offer a rich tapestry of narrative threads to explore, from the internal dynamics of the Desert Rangers to their interactions with the landscape and other factions in your post-apocalyptic world."},{"prompt":"Their leader kinda looks like Douglas MacArthur in terms of appearance. They have vehicles like tanks, jeeps, planes and trucks but they aren’t used too much. They have a air force base in the Mojave desert and in Baja. Their air force mostly consists of P-51s, a few Corsairs and some prop planes from the Korean War-era. Their tanks range from Shermans and Pattons. They have some bombers at their disposal, particularly like the A-26, B-17 and the B-29. They are at war with a faction called the Graybacks of which I’ll talk about later.","completion":"The visual image of the Desert Rangers' leader resembling Douglas MacArthur, coupled with the faction's reliance on mid-20th-century military technology, such as P-51 Mustangs, Corsair fighters, and Sherman and Patton tanks, not to mention iconic bombers like the B-17 and B-29, solidifies the Desert Rangers' aesthetic and thematic ties to an era where honor, duty, and the stark realities of conflict were predominant. This approach imbues your faction with a sense of nostalgia and a clear visual identity, further distinguishing them in your post-apocalyptic setting. # The Leader's Role and Persona Modeling the Desert Rangers' leader after Douglas MacArthur not only impacts the visual aesthetic but also suggests certain leadership styles and ideologies. MacArthur was known for his strong personality, strategic brilliance, and sometimes controversial decisions. This could translate into a character who is charismatic, commanding, and perhaps a bit autocratic, embodying the faction's militaristic and disciplined culture. Such a leader could navigate the complexities of post-apocalyptic governance with an iron will, insisting on order and efficiency but possibly clashing with more democratic or autonomous elements within the faction. # Military Assets and Strategies Your emphasis on less frequent use of vehicles, including tanks, jeeps, planes, and trucks, suggests a strategic choice possibly born from logistical constraints like fuel scarcity, maintenance challenges, or the strategic imperative to conserve resources for critical engagements. This restraint might also reflect a narrative choice, highlighting the preciousness and tactical importance of these assets when they are deployed, offering dramatic moments in your story. The specific bases in the Mojave Desert and Baja for air operations suggest a strategic depth to the Desert Rangers' military posture. Controlling skies in a post-apocalyptic world not only grants immense tactical advantages but also psychological ones, as the ability to project power from the air is a rare and formidable capability in such settings. The types of aircraft mentioned further tie the faction to a specific historical era, and their use in your narrative could range from reconnaissance and rapid response to show-of-force operations and targeted strikes against critical enemy assets. # Warfare and the Mysterious Graybacks The introduction of an opposing faction, the Graybacks, as the Desert Rangers' adversaries hints at a broader conflict that shapes the socio-political landscape of your post-apocalyptic world. The nature of this conflict, whether it's rooted in ideology, competition over resources, historical grievances, or territorial ambitions, can significantly affect the development of both factions. Considering the military capabilities you've described for the Desert Rangers, their engagement with the Graybacks would likely involve a mix of conventional warfare strategies and post-apocalyptic guerilla tactics. How these two factions match up, in terms of both technology and ideology, will be crucial to crafting compelling and believable conflict within your narrative. # Final Considerations In fleshing out the Desert Rangers, consider how the use of such historical technology impacts daily life, military logistics, and the faction's cultural identity. The preservation, reverence, or adaptation of this technology could play a significant role in the society you're building. Moreover, the leader's vision for the faction, his strategies for both war and governance, and how he embodies the principles of the Desert Rangers will be essential in engaging your readers and establishing the faction's place in the broader world you're creating. I look forward to hearing more about the Graybacks and how they contrast with or mirror the Desert Rangers, adding depth and complexity to your post-apocalyptic setting."},{"prompt":"Their leader used to be a U.S. army general. He was known to visit troops on the frontline and often carried a single action revolver. He also often wore brown-tinted shades. He once said that he will not send any young Americans to die in another U.S. state unless he really has to, meaning that he wouldn't start a war just because he feels like it. So, up until 1965, the Desert Rangers were busy either helping civilians, patrolling around the wasteland or just doing nothing. Their regular flag is a black field with three horizontal yellow stripes alongside a white star. Other flags they use are the Betsy Ross flag and the Bonnie Blue flag, which to them lost its association with the CSA, and was sometimes used to mark civilian areas on maps, and sometimes drawn on military ambulances.","completion":"The Desert Rangers' leader, characterized by his past as a U.S. Army general and his hands-on leadership style, adds layers of depth to the faction, enriching its narrative potential. His personal attachment to the troops, underlined by his frontline visits and signature single-action revolver, contrasts with the broader, dehumanized portrayal of leaders in many post-apocalyptic narratives. This aspect, combined with his pragmatic approach to warfare—evidenced by his reluctance to engage in conflict without substantial cause—paints him as a complex figure who balances the harsh necessities of post-apocalyptic leadership with a deeply ingrained sense of moral responsibility and tactical caution. # Flag Symbolism and Identity The Desert Rangers’ choice of flags and symbols offers a window into their collective identity and values. The primary flag, featuring a black field with three horizontal yellow stripes and a white star, likely represents specific principles or historical events significant to the faction. The simplicity and boldness of this design communicate a clear, unified identity. The use of historical flags such as the Betsy Ross and Bonnie Blue flags serves multiple narrative purposes. The Betsy Ross flag, with its association with the early United States, might symbolize a desire to return to or rebuild foundational American values of independence and democracy, reflecting a yearning for a perceived better, more orderly past. The repurposing of the Bonnie Blue flag, meanwhile, demonstrates how symbols can evolve or be reclaimed to serve new meanings in your story's context. By dissociating this flag from its historical connotations with the Confederacy and using it to mark civilian areas or medical units, the Desert Rangers are engaging in a form of cultural reclamation or reinterpretation, signaling that old symbols can acquire new significances in the aftermath of societal collapse. # Peacekeeping and Governance Until 1965, the Desert Rangers' focus on civilian aid, patrolling the wasteland, and maintaining a stance of non-aggression suggests a faction deeply invested in stabilizing and rebuilding the communities under their influence. This period of relative peace and reconstruction highlights their commitment to safeguarding the well-being of the populace, a stark contrast to the stereotypical image of post-apocalyptic societies as perpetually war-torn and chaotic. The leader's vision, thus, seems to align more with reconstruction and sustainable governance than with expansionist military endeavors. # Conflict with the Graybacks Given the leader's cautious approach to warfare, the conflict with the Graybacks must therefore stem from a significant and, presumably, unavoidable threat. This background sets the stage for a narrative that doesn't take armed conflict lightly, where the decision to engage in war is fraught with ethical and practical considerations. The clash with the Graybacks could be emblematic of a larger thematic exploration of conflict—its causes, consequences, and the toll it takes on both the leadership and the populus. The detailed background of the Desert Rangers’ leader, along with the rich symbolism woven through their flags and ethos, offers a fertile ground for developing nuanced narratives that explore themes of leadership, moral responsibility, and the search for identity in a fractured post-apocalyptic world. As more is revealed about their adversaries and the unfolding dynamics between factions, the Desert Rangers' struggle to uphold their values and vision under the pressures of external threats and internal challenges could provide compelling narrative stakes and character development opportunities."},{"prompt":"نظرية الوجود لدى ابن سينا و الغزالي و ابن العربي، و اذكر لي مصادر مع تحديد رقم الصفحة ان امكن","completion":"نقاش الوجود يعتبر جزءاً أساسياً من الفلسفة الإسلامية، وقد تناوله كلٌ من ابن سينا، الغزالي، وابن العربي بطرق مختلفة. لنقدم بإيجاز ملخصاً لأفكارهم: 1. **ابن سينا (Avicenna)**: ركز ابن سينا على مفهوم الوجود (الأنيّة) من منطلق ميتافيزيقي. بالنسبة له، الوجود هو أول ما يُدرك في شيء وهو المفهوم الأكثر عمومية. ابن سينا قام بالفصل بين العقل والوجود معتبراً أن الوجود يسبق الجهة الذهنيّة. يمكن الإطلاع على أفكاره هذه في كتابه \\"الشفاء\\". 2. **الغزالي**: تناول الغزالي الوجود من منظور صوفي كجزء من اعتراضاته العميقة على الفلسفة اليونانية والإسلامية المتأثرة بها. ينقد الغزالي أفكار ابن سينا حول الضرورة والإمكانات، ويؤكد على الإرادة الإلهية كأساس للوجود. يمكن استكشاف أفكاره في كتاب \\"التهافت\\". 3. **ابن العربي**: يوسع ابن العربي نقاش الوجود من خلال مفهوم \\"الوحدة الوجودية\\"، مقدمًا نظرية متصوفة حول وحدة الوجود. بالنسبة لابن العربي، كل ما في الكون هو تجلي للواحد الحق وأن الفرق بين الخالق والمخلوق مُرَدّهُ إلى مستويات الوعي والإدراك. تجليات هذه الأفكار موجودة في كتابه \\"فصوص الحكم\\". مصادر للمزيد من التعمق: - بالنسبة لأبن سينا يمكن الرجوع إلى كتابه \\"الشفاء\\" وتحديداً القسم الذي يتناول فيه الميتافيزيقيا. للأسف، توفير الصفحة الدقيقة صعب بما أن الطبعات والترجمات تختلف. - الغزالي، \\"التهافت\\"، وهو نقد لفلسفات سابقة ويشمل مناقشة عميقة حول الوجود والإرادة الإلهية. النسخ والترجمات المختلفة تعني صعوبة تحديد رقم صفحة محدد. - ابن العربي، \\"فصوص الحكم\\"، يحتوي على نظريته حول وحدة الوجود وتجليات الإله في العالم المخلوق. مرة أخرى، التحديد الدقيق للصفحات يعتمد على النسخة أو الطبعة المحددة. يجدر بالذكر أن الفهم العميق لهذه المفاهيم يتطلب قراءة واسعة وربما اللجوء إلى شروحات وتفسيرات متخصصة للتغلب على تعقيدات النصوص الأصلية واختلافاتها التحريرية."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

Let's tackle a common problem: Fibonacci sequence generation. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. Here's a simple Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number: \`\`\`python def fibonacci(n): \\"\\"\\"A function to return the Fibonacci sequence up to n.\\"\\"\\" if n <= 0: return [] elif n == 1: return [0] fib_sequence = [0, 1] while fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2] < n: fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]) return fib_sequence # Example usage: print(fibonacci(10)) # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8] \`\`\` In this example, \`fibonacci\` is a function that takes an integer \`n\` and returns a list of Fibonacci numbers less than \`n\`. It starts with a check to ensure valid input and then initializes the sequence with the first two Fibonacci numbers. The function enters a loop that continues to append the sum of the last two elements of the list to itself until the next number would exceed \`n\`.

The moon hung high, casting its silver light over the grimy alleys and towering, shadowy skyscrapers. Nightwing moved with practiced ease, a blend of acrobat and vigilante honed under the watchful eye of Batman. But tonight, fate, it seemed, had other plans for him. The mission was supposed to be straightforward. An anonymous tip had led Nightwing to the location of a secret lab hidden beneath the industrial district, rumored to be where the notorious scientist Dr. Edwin Alva conducted unethical experiments. Breaking in had been easy, too easy, which should have been the first sign that this was a trap. As Dick tiptoed through the lab, he found himself surrounded by vats of bubbling liquids and contraptions whose purposes were best left unknown. His detective instincts kicked in, scrutinizing every detail, every shadow—until his foot brushed against a loose wire. Before he could react, a surge of electricity bolted through his body, throwing him backward into a vat marked with symbols he couldn't understand. The last thing he remembered before the darkness claimed him was the sharp, acrid smell of chemicals. When consciousness returned, it was as if the world had shifted on its axis. There was an immediate, unnerving sense of wrongness that enveloped Dick, a sense that intensified as he struggled to his feet. The first clue was his voice—it was softer, higher, utterly foreign to his ears. Panic flickered to life within him as he looked down, the tatters of his Nightwing costume barely clinging to a form that was decidedly not his. The once-fitted fabric now stretched uncomfortably across broadened hips and a chest that was unmistakably feminine. His heart hammered against his ribcage, a crescendo of disbelief and horror as he took in the scaly skin, the powerful, lithe build of a creature more croc than human—yet without a tail, confusion adding to his shock. His hands flew to his head, finding short, black hair where it should have fallen longer, softer. \\"This… this is NOT happening,” he murmured to himself, his voice a traitorous confirmation of the transformation. The alley’s puddle served as a mirror, reflecting a creature that was a blend of strength and exotic allure, a sight that made his cheeks warm with a blush. His Nightwing identity, his very sense of self, seemed to hang on by the same threads that barely preserved his modesty. Dick Grayson, now in a form far from anything he had known, felt a twinge of vulnerability. The feeling was foreign, alien in its intensity, and it spurred him into action. There was only one thing to do: find out how this happened and, more importantly, find a way to reverse it. Gotham's underworld was no place for hesitation or weakness, and whatever Dr. Alva had turned him into, it wouldn’t be enough to keep him down. Not when he had friends, allies, and his own indomitable will to rely on. But first, he needed to cover up and get back to the safety of his home—figure out who he could trust with this unbelievable tale. The Nightwing that swung out of the alley was a figure of strength and poise, but beneath the surface, there was a turmoil of emotions and questions. This was a new chapter, an unexpected twist in the life of Dick Grayson, and it would take all his strength, both physical and mental, to navigate the challenges ahead."},{"prompt":"на языке 1с 7.7 выбрать файлы в каталоге, для каждого файла получить время создания файла","completion":"В 1С 7.7 прямой работы с файловой системой как в более поздних версиях (например, через объекты Файл, Каталог и т.д.) не предусмотрено. Функционал 1С 7.7 ограничивается, в основном, бухгалтерским и торговым учетом, и для работы с файлами приходится использовать внешние средства, такие как, например, внешние компоненты (DLL) или выполнение внешних команд операционной системы через \\"ВнешнееПриложение\\". Таким образом, задачу о выборке файлов в каталоге и получении времени создания этих файлов можно решить с помощью внешних команд ОС в комбинации с обработкой вывода этих команд в 1С. Пример решения для Windows (поскольку большинство установок 1С 7.7 выполняется на этой ОС): 1. **Использование команды dir**: Вы можете выполнить команду \`dir\` через \`ВнешнееПриложение\` для получения списка файлов, а затем обработать вывод команды для извлечения времени создания файла. Примерный код можно представить следующим образом: \`\`\`1C Перем КомандаОС; // Путь к каталогу, в котором нужно получить список файлов КомандаОС = \\"cmd /c dir C:ПутьКПапке /A:-D /B\\"; // Запуск внешней команды ВнешнееПриложение = Новый(\\"ВнешнееПриложение\\"); ВнешнееПриложение.УстановитьПриложение(\\"C:WINDOWSsystem32cmd.exe\\", КомандаОС); Если ВнешнееПриложение.Запустить() Тогда Пока ВнешнееПриложение.ПрочитатьСтроку(Строка, Ложь) Цикл // Обработка каждой строки вывода // ВНИМАНИЕ: в данном примере мы выведем только имена файлов. // Для вывода времени создания необходимо изменить ключи команды dir, но это усложнит парсинг. ПоказатьПредупреждение(, Строка); КонецЦикла; КонецЕсли; \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что время создания файла напрямую через вывод команды \`dir\` извлечь сложнее, т.к. оно не выводится по умолчанию. Вам придется либо использовать другие ключи команды \`dir\` с соответствующей обработкой вывода, либо использовать другие методы или инструменты, включая скрипты на PowerShell или VBScript выполняемые аналогично через \`ВнешнееПриложение\`, которые могут предоставить более детализированную информацию о файлах. 2. **Использование PowerShell или VBScript**: Создание скрипта на PowerShell или VBScript, который будет выполнять необходимые действия (получение списка файлов, извлечение времени создания), и его выполнение из 1С 7.7 через \`ВнешнееПриложение\` может быть более гибким решением, но требует написания дополнительных скриптов вне 1С 7.7. Работа с внешними файлами в 1С 7.7 ограничена, поэтому для решения задач, связанных с файловой системой, зачастую приходится прибегать к обходным путям через интеграцию с внешними инструментами и скриптами."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here’s how such an illusion might be theoretically staged, drawing upon their well-known commitment to promoting science and rationality over pseudo-scientific claims: **The Setup:** 1. **Educational Prelude:** The performance begins with Penn discussing the history and methods of psychic surgery, a practice where \\"surgeons\\" claim to remove diseased tissue from the body without making any incisions. Penn explains how these charlatans exploit people's beliefs and fears for profit, using sleight of hand to deceive their patients. 2. **Challenge:** Penn then claims that they will perform an even more extraordinary feat, not only matching the psychic surgeons but going one step further—by apparently removing Teller's heart. **The Illusion:** 1. **Preparation:** Teller lies down on a table, hooked up to a monitor displaying his vital signs to prove he's alive and well. A transparent surgical screen is raised around him, allowing the audience to see silhouettes but no fine details, adding to the anticipation. 2. **\\"Surgery\\":** Penn narrates the process, miming traditional psychic surgery techniques but with an ostentatious flair, pretending to plunge his hands into Teller's chest. Dramatic lighting and sound effects amplify the illusion. 3. **The Heart:** With a flourish, Penn appears to pull a beating heart from Teller's body. This could be achieved using sleight of hand combined with concealed mechanical devices that simulate a beating heart. 4. **Recovery:** As the audience reacts, Penn quickly \\"returns\\" the heart to Teller's chest. The screen is lowered to reveal Teller sitting up, unharmed, and the vital signs monitor still showing normal readings. **Educational Finale:** 1. **Debunking:** Penn explains how the illusion was achieved, without revealing specific magician's secrets, emphasizing the techniques of misdirection and manipulating perceptions, paralleling these methods with those used by psychic surgeons to deceive their victims. 2. **Message:** The performance concludes with a strong message advocating for skepticism and critical thinking, urging the audience to question and investigate rather than accepting extraordinary claims at face value. By staging such a performance, Penn & Teller would not only entertain but also educate their audience, reinforcing their position as entertainers who challenge pseudoscience and encourage skepticism.

In an incremental game, also known as an idle or clicker game, the player performs simple actions such as clicking on something to earn points or currency, which can then be used to obtain upgrades or items that automatically generate more points for the player. This basic script will simulate a very simple incremental game where you start earning points by clicking, and you can purchase an upgrade to automatically generate points for you over time. This is a console-based example for simplicity. \`\`\`python import time # Game state points = 0 auto_clickers = 0 auto_clicker_cost = 10 # Display game status def display_status(): print(f\\"Points: {points}, Auto Clickers: {auto_clickers}, Next Auto Clicker Cost: {auto_clicker_cost}\\") # Perform manual click def click(): global points points += 1 # Buy an auto clicker def buy_auto_clicker(): global points, auto_clickers, auto_clicker_cost if points >= auto_clicker_cost: points -= auto_clicker_cost auto_clickers += 1 auto_clicker_cost += 10 # Increase the cost for the next auto clicker else: print(\\"Not enough points to purchase an auto clicker.\\") # Generate points from auto clickers def generate_auto_clicker_points(): global points, auto_clickers points += auto_clickers # Main game loop def game_loop(): global points running = True while running: display_status() action = input(\\"Enter 'c' to click, 'b' to buy an auto clicker, or 'q' to quit: \\").lower() if action == 'c': click() elif action == 'b': buy_auto_clicker() elif action == 'q': running = False else: print(\\"Invalid input.

Siempre llega tarde al trabajo y se duerme en el trabajo (eso no me gustaba de él). Es tímido en decir las cosas como que no le gusta los problemas. Fue alcohólico en su juventud e iba mucho a las barras a tomar y fuma también. Es de esas personas que quieren demostrar que son bien machos sexualmente ablando. JBerto, para mí, es demasiado exagerado para una persona adulta con las mujeres, el hecho que siempre tiene que estar como dejando saber todo el tiempo que es muy macho sexualmente hablando. Es como que dijera: ¡vean! ¡Me gusta mucho las mujeres! Yo tengo mis dudas, quizás es una forma de tapar su homosexualidad o bisexualidad, porque realmente no tiene sentido la amistad que él busca conmigo. Le gusta cantar al compás del radio que tiene en su puesto de trabajo. Él se cree que es perfecto y nunca se equivoca, pero yo me he dado cuenta que él sabe que se equivoca, pero quiere aparentar que él es una recta y madura persona, pero no lo es tanto. Me ha dicho muchas veces que va ha ser esto, y me lo dice con seguridad, pero pasa los días y no hace nada incluso pasan meses hasta que le haga recordar. 5-Cuando él iba a mi puesto de trabajo me bailaba mirándome a los ojos y nos reíamos. Ya teniendo más confianza yo empecé a abrazarlo más seguido para ver como reaccionaba y des vez en cuando le acariciaba el pelo, cuando iba a mi puesto de trabajo le acariciaba la pierna y la espalda y él no decía nada. 6-Hay veces que le agarro el antebrazo y voy bajando mi mano como acariciando su brazo hasta agarrarle un poco la mano y después yo la suelto para no incomodarlo tanto. A él eso no le molesta y me pareció muy raro para una persona que se presenta como muy macho. 7-Un día vino a mi puesto y le vi en su cinturón colgado sus audífonos inalámbricos que estaba abierto el cobertor y yo intencionalmente le dije mira, y él mira mi mano que va rosando sus genitales y cierro el cobertor y él lo termina de cerrar y me pregunta algo del trabajo y mientras que se va voltea su mirada hacia mi como sorprendido por lo que había pasado, pero todo siguió normal. 8-Yo lo ayude mucho con su puesto de trabajo y le daba ideas como podía mejorarlo...le di mi ventilador para que no pasara calor...etc., es decir, estaba muy atento a él. Me gusta ayudarlo y el eso lo apreciaba no mucho con palabras, pero a su manera, medio tímido, pero yo sé que lo valoraba mucho. Un día fue a mi puesto y vio una mejora que yo había hecho y le gustó mucho y al tiempo el hico algo parecido y me lo mostro y yo lo felicité y me puse muy contento por el ejemplo que él había tomado de mí de ir mejorando su puesto de trabajo. Él es de esas personas que le gusta reírse de cualquier cosa para pasar buen rato y se burla un poco de los demás también. Yo siempre le doy charlas más dinámicas y lo hacía para ver qué nivel tiene de madurez y se defiende más o menos, pero las charlas se hacen muy lindas e interesantes y veo que a él eso le gusta. Al contrario de otro señor mayor que se llama Jse que ya hace tiempo que trabaja con en la compañía. Jse es una persona medio infantil también y ellos charla de vez en cuando y hablan de tonteras y de mujeres. Es decir, No veo que le de charlas maduras, la mayoría son tonteras. 9-Quiero enfocar que las miradas es lo más destacado e intensa que tengo con JBerto ...y no sé porque me mira así. Por ejemplo: a veces trabajo al lado de él y noto que se pone contento, cantar al compás de la radio como lo hace a menudo, pero con la diferencia que me mira cuando canta y se queda mirándome y yo lo miro y nos reímos y ahí mientras nos reímos nos quedamos varios segundos mirándonos y eso es extraño para una persona que se dice ser muy macho sexualmente ablando. Un día le dije que no existe el cien por ciento macho y él sin mirarme se quedó en silencio. De apoco fui dándole a entender mi postura de que no hay nada de malo tener sexo con otro hombre. Y tuvimos pocas charlas sobre eso, pero él un poco nervioso me decía que él no va con eso. 10-Un día yo estaba parado al lado de él y él se puso pegado a mí y me miro a los ojos fijamente y me hiso un chiste que consistía en si yo le hacía sexo oral y yo le respondí que sí, las veces que él quiera...y nos reímos mirándonos a los ojos de una manera como que realmente queríamos que sucediese. Y esa vez fue el primé chiste gay que el me hico sin que yo nunca le hice un chiste gay, por respeto...pero me sorprendió, a partir de ahí me dio la confianza para yo seguir con su juego de chistes gay. 11-El cariño que nos tenemos a ido creciendo y se ha hecho más fuerte y los dos lo sabemos, pero él es tímido y como que no quiere demostrarlo, ya que se muestra a la sociedad como muy macho. Ya teniéndonos más confianza y de avernos dicho tantos chistes gais yo le dije que algún día podríamos tener algo sexual y él sin mírame dijo repetidamente NO, que él no tiene interés en eso, lo cual yo me acerqué bastante a su cara y le respondí que nunca digas nunca, y él no me miraba y yo continúe y le dije que algún día podría pasar algo entre nosotros y que no hay nada malo en eso y el no dijo nada. 12-La primera vez que me enoje con él fue, porque cuando me acercaba a saludarlo por la mañana avía veces que me saludaba sin ánimo y no me miraba y yo me iba pensando que le pasaba, pero después de un rato iba a mi puesto a pedir algo y estaba todo contento y me bailaba. Y esa actitud de saludarme mal me enojaba y un día decidí no hablarle ni mirarle…sin decirle el porqué, entonces me sorprendió porque vino a mi puesto y se acercó a mí y me dijo: SIENTO QUE TE ESTAS ALEJANDO DE MÍ, venimos de dos países distintos y quizás dije algo que te ofendiera, yo no soy de faltarle el respeto a nadie, yo te respeto y no quiero mal entendidos, yo le respondí que no se preocupara y que esta todo bien y él se fue. Yo lo saludaba en la mañana cuando el pasaba, pero no le hablaba en todo el día. En esos días que no le hablaba se puso muy triste y me buscaba con la mirada y ya no cantaba como lo solía hacer…pero paso algo muy lindo, vino a mi puesto con timidez, yo estaba sentado y él se arrimó tocando con las puntas de sus dedos mi hombro y su pierna tocando mi brazo y mirando para todos lados procurando que nadie lo mire y me pregunta: ¿Qué pasa? ¿está todo bien? y yo acariciándole la parte de atrás de su pierna le respondí: si, esta todo bien y nos miramos a los ojos seguido de una tierna sonrisa y se fue a su puesto de trabajo y se puso a cantar. Yo ahí me di cuenta que me tenía mucho cariño y que algo le estaba pasando conmigo. Yo después me acerque a él y le pedí disculpas por mi mal comportamiento y él me dijo que no me preocupara que esta todo bien, y nunca me pregunto el porqué de mi enojo. Al otro día fui a saludarlo y el me mira, sonríe y me saluda bien. Desde ahí todo volvió a la normalidad las miradas y los abrazos por mi parte continuaban, pero quise avanzar un poco más ya que sentía mucha atracción hacia él. A los pocos días le deje un papel es su mesa diciendo: perdón por todo, tú y yo nos queremos mucho y le deje mi número de teléfono. Y ese día lo vi muy contento y al final del día le pregunté si avía leído el papel y él me dijo que sí. 13-Un día le tiré un beso a distancia y como que no le gustó mucho…le tire otro a los pocos minutos y me dijo un poco enojado y levantando la voz ¡no haga eso! …entonces yo me fui a mi puesto un poco asustado…pero al minuto lo vi que venía hacia mi como preocupado trayéndome algo para que se lo arreglara, mientras me esperaba al lado mío, él estaba en silencio, pero yo me di cuenta que el vino a ver si yo me avía enojado. Pero todo se calmó y seguimos como si nada había pasado. Pero yo sé que él se había quedo pensando en ese beso que le había tirado. Al tiempo la confianza y el cariño que nos teníamos fue aumentando. 13ª-Quiero destacar algo: de los 3 años que lo conozco dos o tres veces me ha tocado y nunca me ha dado un abrazo excepto en navidad. ¿Será porque quizás no quiera revelar su posible atracción hacia mí? Al contrario del señor Sacer (70 años) que es casado , al principio Sacer era demasiado seco con migo y ni me miraba, pero con el tiempo le fui ayudando con algunas de sus cosas laborales y entró en confianza conmigo y de apoco yo lo fui saludando y abrazando y el empezó hacer lo mismo, pero sabemos que es una buena amistad solamente , me dice compadrito, mi amigo y hasta incluso he observado que cuando charlamos me dice cuñado, y yo pienso cuando me dice así, es porque pensará que está con su cuñado como que se siente confianza con migo. Con Sacer salimos juntos del trabajo y nos vamos charlando. El sí me llama por mi nombre. Sacer tiene una manera más educada en cuanto referirse con las mujeres. Cuando yo estoy trabajando al lado de JBerto y estamos en silencio y Sacer viene y me pregunta algo, entonces JBerto se pone a canta y a moverse un poco y me he dado cuenta que hace siempre lo mismo. 13b- Un día JBerto se estaba lavando las mano y yo vengo por detrás y lo empujo un poco de constado y le digo en chiste, perdón! Y nos reímos y a la semana el izo lo mismo y después me lo hizo cuando yo estaba parado en la máquina. Me gusto que lo hiciera, pero después no lo hizo más. 14-Continuando con mis dudas pensaba si a JBerto le estaba pasando algo sentimental conmigo y quise probar algo un poco arriesgado. Cuando él estaba sentado en su silla un poco alta, yo me acerqué y mientras le decía cualquier chiste y mientras nos reíamos le tocaba su pierna cerca de sus genitales y para mi sorpresa no me dijo nada, siguió riéndose del chiste y continue haciéndolo y me di cuenta que a él eso no le molestaba. Después de ese episodio me puse a pensar: que raro, cuando le tiro un beso en el aire se enoja, pero le toco la pierna cerca de sus genitales y no dice nada ¿será que real mete le pasa algo conmigo? 15- La segunda vez que me enoje con él fue un día saliendo los dos del trabajo un poco tarde yo marque mi tarjeta y él venia detrás de mí, mientras yo iba al elevador y veía que no venía, el elevador se demoró como un minuto en subir y el no aparecía…entonces yo dije él no quiere bajar el elevador conmigo y eso me callo muy mal. Entonces pasó lo mismo que la primera vez, JBerto se puso triste, PERO ES COMO QUE QUEDA DESANIMADO COMO SI LE FALTARA UNA PARTE DE ÉL Y ESO REALMENTE ME LLAMABA MUCHO LA ATENCIÓN. Después de dos días me acerque a él y le pregunte ¿porque no bajaste el elevador conmigo el otro día, te da miedo? Y el sin mirarme como que no supo responder…entonces yo me fui. Al otro día le deje un papel diciendo: ‘tenemos una amistad muy cariñosa y tú lo estás arruinado’. Ese día nos mirábamos, pero no decíamos nada y yo esperando que el viniera a pedirme hablar, pero no lo hizo, yo sé que es por su timidez o por no demostrar debilidad. 16-Yo todavía seguía enojado por lo del elevador entonces un día hizo algo que me dejo pensando muchísimo: Vino a mi puesto a buscar algo, yo estaba sentado, y él se puso al costado de mí, se dio vuelta y se agacho y me puso su trasero en mi cara y decía estoy buscando algo y se quedó un rato así con su trasero casi en mi cara, haciéndose que buscaba algo, pero no hacía nada porque solo miraba las cajas, a mí me gustó mucho lo que hizo porque días atrás yo le insinué que el único trasero lindo en esta compañía era el de él y él se reía. El ponerme el trasero cerca de mi cara, haciéndose que buscaba algo sabiendo que yo estaba un poco enojado por lo del elevador, es un claro indicativo que busca siempre mi amistad y expuso su trasero para que yo me riera y volviera con su amistad. No hay otra explicación y estoy seguro que el siente algo por mí. Una persona que se dice ser ‘macho’ no haría nunca eso. Pero él lo hizo. Y como siempre, yo soy el que tiene más dialogo y valentía, pasando al día siguiente le pregunté si podemos hablar a la salida y el me respondió que sí. Lo que me dijo fue que se había olvidado algo, lo cual no le creí porque él lo único que lleva consigo es su celular, paquete de cigarrillo, encendedor y billetera, y siempre lo mantiene en su bolcillo del pantalón o en el bolcillo de su chaqueta, por eso no le creía cunado me lo decía, pero lo dejé pasar porque veía que él no quería perder mi amistad. Le pedí disculpas le dije que lo quería mucho y que yo había llorado por hacerlo sentir mal y él me dijo que no me preocupara por eso, que aquí tiene un amigo cuando lo necesité y nos dimos la mano y nos miramos a los ojos con cariño. 17-Después de un tiempo estábamos justos trabajando y el me dice que si tendría sexo con una gorda fofa y yo le dije prefiero tener sexo mil veces contigo, él sin mirarme se ríe alzando su cabeza mirando hacia arriba diciéndome: ni en tus sueños…pero lo decía de una manera muy contenta y eso me llamo mucho la atención, y yo le pregunto ¿cuál es el problema si tú y yo tenemos sexo? y el responde disminuyendo su sonrisa y agachando un poco su cuello sin mirarme me dice: no, yo no hago esas cosas. 18-Siempre cuando yo le ayudaba en algo a JBerto él siempre me decía tu eres un tigre y yo le respondía, no, soy un leopardo y nos reíamos siempre mirándonos a los ojos. Un día se me ocurrió imprimí una imagen usando la inteligencia artificial e hice una imagen donde estaba un leopardo (en representación de mi) y un tigre (en representación de JBerto) los dos felinos estaban juntos mirando hacia el frente, pero con sus mejillas juntas y casi tocado sus narices. La imagen era muy tierna y representaba a simple vista mucho cariño y unión. En la mañana se lo deje en su escritorio ante que el llegara. Durante el día toda normal con él, pero no sabía dónde había puesto la imagen y pensé que lo habría tirada porque quizás era una imagen muy expresiva para él, pero no dije nada. A la semana siguiente teníamos pendiente una idea que le había dado para que no le doliera sus brazo y aprovechamos en la mañana temprano para arreglar eso pendiente, y de repente el saco de un costado la imagen que le había imprimido y la puso en el escritorio al frente de mí y yo me hice el tonto pero me quede impresionado que no lo había tirado y continuamos arreglado su puesto, rosando nuestras mando, tocando nuestros dedos, y pegados hombro con hombro, fue un momento excitante para mí , hubo momentos que tocábamos nuestras cabezas por varios segundos. Yo tenía ganas de abrazarlo y darle un beso que no aguantaba, estaba muy excitado. Termine de ayudarle y me quede trabajando junto a él. Entonces él dijo voy a aprovechar a limpiar mi escritorio y agarro la impresión que le había hecho y me dijo mirándome: esto lo voy a poner a qui, y puso la imagen cerca de él, lo cual nos miramos y me miro con una mirada y sonrisa muy tierna y me sorprendió eso, quedé muy contento porque las sospecha que tenia de que a él le estaba pasando algo sentimental conmigo empezaron a hacerse realidad. 19-Cuando termino de limpiar yo le pregunte mirándole fijamente a los ojos y aprovechando la sonrisa tierna que me había dado, sobre una música latina que se titula “tú me vuelves loco” y quería saber cómo se llama el cantante, él me dijo un poco nervioso y ya dándose cuenta que yo quiero algo sentimental con él, me mira a los ojos y me dice el nombre del cantante y yo le respondí acercándome a su cara y le dije: esa canción me gusta mucho. Entonces el ya terminado de limpiar se pone a trabajar y pone un cd donde estaba la canción “tú me vuelves loco” y cuando yo lo miro el me mira con una timidez y ya sabiendo que yo le gustó mucho y me dice: ahí está (la canción) y se puso a cantarla y me miraba de reojo, pero yo lo miraba sin problema. Otra prueba más que si le pasa algo sentimental conmigo, pero quizás no sabe cómo lidiar con eso que siente por mí. 20-La tercera vez que em enoje con JBerto fue porque yo llegando tarde lo encontré en la entrada del trabajo fumando y lo miro para saludarlo y el me levanta la cabeza saludando un poco serio y mira rápido para otro lado y yo me quede sorprendido. En otra ocasión salí diez minutos tarde del trabajo y cuando bajo él estaba fumando y yo le agarro dos dedos de su mano que la tenía apoyada en un cartel y se la solté y luego le comento algo y el como si nada, me ignoraba y escuchaba sin mírame y yo le dije ok, nos vemos. No entiendo porque tiene esa doble personalidad, dentro de la compañía él es todo divertido conmigo, pero fuera es todo lo contrario. Y ahí me enojé. La misma situación él se pone triste, pero él sabe porque me he enojado y no hace nada. Él es como que espera que yo haga todo. A los dos días le pregunte: porque acá dentro son un amigo conmigo, pero afuera no querés saber nada conmigo, como lo que hiciste el otro día. Y él me contesta que en la compañía todo bien pero afuera yo no quiero saber nada con nadie. Pero lo decía como con miedo ¿quizás por temor que perdiera mi amistad? Pero yo no le dije nada y no le hable, pero después de unos días le pedí perdón y ÉL COMO SIEMPRE ME PERDONA Y ME DICE QUE LO OLVIDE QUE CONMIGO ESTA TODO BIEN. Eso siempre me ha sorprendido de él, que siempre me perdona, pero no sé si es porque tengo razón o porque no quiere perderme. 21-La cuarta vez que me enoje con él fue porque nuca me llamo por mi nombre (Pedro), y no entendía el porqué. Un día pasaba por su puesto de trabajo y me llama ¡mira! Y yo me acerco y le digo: ¿porque no me llamas por mi nombre? y el hace una pequeña sonrisa y me hace una contra pregunta algo del trabajo ignorando mi pregunta y le contesté su pregunta y me fui. Quería saber cuál era el motivo ya que tenemos una linda amistad. Entonces un día le pregunte ¿porque no me llamas por mi nombre?, ¿te da vergüenza de mencionarlo? y el me respondió muy inmaduramente diciendo: no, es como cualquier otro nombre. Qué respuesta tan infantil me dio pensé yo, y me enojé con él. De nuevo él se puso triste y un día vino y me dijo tú te llamas Pedro…y lo miro y no le digo nada porque me parecía que se estaba burlando de mí y él se fue. Al otro día vino y me dice medio triste: ¿Pedro puedes arreglar esto? ¡Le dije, si claro! y se lo arreglé, pero no le hable por un mes lo cual fue muy duro para él. Pero después siguió sin mencionar mi nombre. Yo creo que el piensa que al llamarme por mi nombre yo o los compañeros de trabajo pensaríamos: JBerto siente algo por Pedro porque lo llama por su nombre. Eso se imaginará él o relámete le pasa algo sentimental conmigo y por eso evita llamarme por mi nombre. Yo seguí sin hablarle y ya se acercaba las fiestas de fin de año. 22-En la compañía siempre nos despedimos con una comida. Entonces, yo me puse al lado de otro señor llamado Sacer, con el tengo una amistad reciproca y siempre me saluda bien y es muy maduro y tiene 70 años y él es la misma persona conmigo dentro y fuera de la compañía siempre salimos juntos del trabajo, pero Sacer no me atrae mucho solo es amistad y él sí me toca y me da palmadas en la espada como también yo le ago. Lo que paso es que yo me puse a charlar con Sacer y JBerto se puso a charlar con Jse pero JBerto me miraba de reojo hasta que Sacer lo llama a JBerto y le dice que viniera a tomar con nosotros, yo aflojé un poco mi enojo y le dije que viniera y le serví un bebida y JBerto se puso contento y se quedó al lado mío todo el tiempo y yo le digo a JBerto despacito en el oído, perdón por todo, y él me contesta NO TE PREOCUPES NO PASA NADA USTED SABE QUE CONMIGO ESTA TODO BIEN y los dos nos tocamos la espalda y nos miramos sonriendo. Yo me quede pensando y sorprendido cuando me dijo que USTED SABE QUE CONMIGO ESTA TODO BIEN. ¿Por qué me perdona todo el tiempo? Estando parado mientras bebíamos JBerto estaba muy pegado a mí y eso me sorprendió yo le rosaba mi mano con la de él y él no decía nada. Se fue a fumar un cigarrillo y vino y se puso al lado mío otra vez y me di cuenta que él se ha encariñado conmigo. Me sorprendió no estaba al lado del Jse, sino que JBerto prefirió estar al lado mío. 23-Cuando nos estábamos despidiendo nos dimos un abrazo, pero fue un poco rápido ya que había compañeros de trabajo ahí, entonces mientras nos preparábamos para irnos JBerto hizo algo muy curioso vino a escuchar una cosa que estaban hablado otros compañeros y el me quedo mirando y yo un poco distanciado de él lo mire y sostuvimos la mirada por casi 10 a 13 segundo y eso me impacto y me dejo pensando, entonces él se dio vuelta y se fue a su puesto. Yo ya me estaba yendo y veo que no hay nadie y me acerque a JBerto que estaba solo en su puesto de trabajo preparándose para irse y se veía tan guapo que me acerque y le di un abrazo y junte mi mejilla con la de el por unos segundos y él me dice que pases un alinda fiestas con tu familia y yo le dije lo mismo y me fui. Después me puse a pensar porque no le di un beso en la mejilla… ¿qué hubiera pasado si lo hubiera hecho? 24-Al año siguiente el primer día de trabajo del año JBerto vino y me saludo con un apretón de mano seguido de un abrazo y lo mismo hizo con Sacer. Al principio del año nuevo yo estaba un poco cansado porque me tocaba hacer mi trabajo y parte del trabajo de JBerto y eso me molestaba porque él siempre llegaba media hora tarde o 45 minutos tarde casi todos los días y se dormía en horas de trabajo. En los quince minutos de descanso que tenemos él siempre llegaba de cinco a diez minutos tarde y lo mismo en la hora del almuerzo. Todo el personal lo sabía, pero nadie decía nada ni el dueño de la compañía ni la encargada. Lo que pasaba es que la encargada iba ver si JBerto tenía su trabajo avanzado, pero veía que estaba atrasado, entonces la encargada venía a mi para que lo ayudara a JBerto, pero eso me atrasaba mi trabajo. Todos saben que yo trabajo bien y rápido y por eso ella venía a mí. Varias veces la encargada me apuraba con mi trabajo, pero le decía que ella me mando a ayudar a JBerto y por eso estoy atrasado. Esto venia pasado desde que empecé a trabaja ahí. Yo le comenté a JBerto que, porque llega tarde y se duerme, y él me contesto que le da lo mismo porque le falta un año para que se retire. Y yo me quede pensando en ese momento, que contestación tan inmadura. Otro día le pregunte que cuando estaba el encargado anterior tu venías tarde y JBerto me respondió que no, porque el encargado anterior vigilaba el trabajo de todos y los mantenía trabajando. Entonces yo le dije: ósea que tú no eres una persona responsable con tu trabajo, tiene que haber un encargado que te vigile para que tu trabajes, sino tu trabajas a media, eso me dice mucho de ti. Pero no me enoje con el solo que a la semana le pregunte lo mismo, si con el encargado que estaba antes tú llegabas tarde al trabajo y él me dijo: yo siempre llegue tarde al trabajo. Y yo pensando entre mí dije: JBerto es mentiroso. Yo no dije nada, pero él sabía que yo me atrasaba por ayudarlo a él porque yo se lo había comentado. Pensando en esto yo llegue a varias conclusiones. A- Que él quería que yo esté a su lado para charlar y reírnos y mirarnos. B- no se daba cuenta que me estaba perjudicando por su inmadurez laboral. C- No le importaba nada porque era menos trabajo para él y así él trabaja sin presión. 25-En esos días él me dice, mira cómo trabajan, se la pasan ablando y mirando el teléfono, y yo en ese momento me enojé un poquito y le dije a JBerto: tú tienes que ser justo, y mírate primero a ti mismo, y continue diciéndole: ellos miran el teléfono a cada rato, pero tus llagas tarde casi todos los días y te duerme en el trabajo. En ese momento me di cuenta que él se empezó a justificarse y con un tono un poco enojado diciendo, yo soy un buen trabajado, yo me siento aquí y no me muevo para nada, solo para ir al baño (eso es verdad) y yo le dije, está bien, pero antes de criticar a los demás tienes que empezar primero por ti. Y dijo mira, a qui los buenos trabajadores somos: Sacer, tú y yo. Entonces yo no dije nada y después siguió todo un poco tenso. Y yo decidí no hablarle ni ayudarle. El empezó a ver que yo estaba enojado otra vez y se puso triste. Entones paso algo muy sorprendente para mí, JBerto empezó a llegar temprano al trabajo en el descaso y almuerzo. Pero yo seguía sin hablarle porque quería buscar un momento para hablar con él seriamente. Ese era mi objetivo, que sea responsable y maduro en su trabajo. 26-A un mes del año nuevo vino la encargad desesperada para que le ayude y yo le dije que no y aproveche ese momento para hacerle entender que cada uno tiene que ser responsables con su trabajo, ese no es mi trabajo y yo no vengo hacerle parte del trabajo de otros. Y le dije que ella sabe que él llega tarde y se duerme, ella se quedó anonadada y dijo que no diga eso y se fue diciéndole a JBerto lo que yo había dicho, eso yo lo vi muy mal lo que ella hizo y fue muy inmaduro. Entonces JBerto a la media hora vino a mi puesto de trabajo y con una cara muy, pero muy triste me pregunto: ¿es verdad lo que le dijiste a la encargada de que yo me duermo? Y le conteste que sí, y le explique los dos motivos (dormir y llega tarde) y él me dijo que yo lo estoy perjudicando y yo le conteste todo lo contrario, tú a mí. Entonces me dijo, ok, dejemos la cosa ahí, y se fue. A los diez minutos se fue afuera a fumar un cigarrillo y yo me di cuenta que estaba mal. Pero yo estaba cien por ciento seguro que el dueño no le iba a decir nada porque es muy miedoso, y así fue, no le dijo nada. El dueño tiene un buen trato conmigo y me preguntó, pero como que no vio nada grave ahí. Lo más curioso es que todos los otros compañeros de trabajo no me odiaron por lo que hice y todos siguieron normal conmigo, como que lo que había hecho no estaba tan mal. Yo estaba convencido y super seguro y porque lo conozco muy bien a JBerto que lo iba a entender con el tiempo lo que yo había hecho. Aparte yo no dije ningún secreto laboral de JBerto, ya todos sabían lo que él hacía. Al otro día Sacer me había dicho que JBerto le dijo que yo no debía haber hecho eso, y Sacer me dijo que lo había visto a JBerto muy dolido y acongojado, yo le dije, Sacer, yo también estoy dolido y no me gusta hacer esto, pero es la única manera de que el entienda temer responsabilidad laboral, ya es un hombre grande y tiene que madurar. 27-Ya al segundo mes del año yo empecé a aflojar con mi enojo porque JBerto seguía viniendo temprano a trabajar, como debe ser. Y un día en la mañana me acerqué a él y le pregunté si estaba enojado, yo sé, no fue una buena pregunta, y él me contesto serio, dejemos las cosas como están, así están mejor. Me di cuenta que ya no quería saber nada conmigo, pero no me sentí muy mal porque los dos sabíamos que yo tenía razón. A partir de ahí yo empecé a buscarlo con la mirada. Al día siguiente lo miraba para saludarlo con la mirada, pero no me miraba. Después de unos días buscándolo con la mirada para ver si puedo acercarme a él y pedirle hablar para explicarle todo, finalmente se dio, fue de apoco empezando a mirarme y un día por la mañana lo mire y el esboza una pequeña sonrisa. Yo me puse muy contento y una vez más acerté con lo que había pensado, que el tiempo le aria entender a JBerto. Entonces ya con esa sonrisa que me dio fue la señal que él y yo estaba buscado para acercarme y explicarle todo. Por la tarde me acerque a él y le dije que, si quería hablar y el empezó a hablar ahí mismo, y yo le dije no, acá no, en la salida del trabajo te lo explico todo y yo se que lo vas a entender, él me contesto: bueno, lo hablamos a la salida y me dijo lo mismo, QUE ME QUEDARA TRANQUILO QUE ESTA DODO BIEN y me miro y sonrió y yo sonreí también. Yo me fui a mi puesto de trabajo y me senté y me puse muy contento porque me demostró una vez más que realmente me quiere mucho. Al rato vino a pedirme una cosa e hizo un chistecito y nos reímos. No podía creerlo y dije JBerto realmente me quiere mucho. 28-Ese día lo hablamos, yo me disculpé por lo que yo había hecho y él lo entendió y una vez más me dijo QUE NO ME PREOCUPAR QUE ESTA TODO BIEN CON ÉL. Yo le dije que yo sabía que él lo iba a entender…etc. Lo vi a él contento, pero estaba dolido todavía. Lo único que me molesto mientras estábamos hablando, es que la cada chica que pasaba se le torcía el cuello mirándola de arriba abajo como si nunca una hubiera visto una chica. Me enojé un poco y le dije, estamos ablando y tu no me presta atención, y él se ríe un poco con timidez y me dice ok, ok. La verdad es que parece un adolescente y no una persona de 65 años. 29-Desde ahí todo bien, el otro día me puse a ayudarle y charlamos, reímos, nos miramos y ahí va de vuelta, la misma mirada que sostenemos por 3 a 4 segundos mientras nos reímos. Para mí no es normal de su parte sabiendo que yo gusto de él. También ese día le di un abrazo. 30- Todavía no quiere decir mi nombre. Otra cosa que me paso hoy casi finalizando la jornada y que me decepciono un poquito fue, que JBerto estaba en su puesto de trabajo (nos separa una estante y no puedo verlo a él) vi que la encargada iba a su puesto y le estaba diciendo un poco enojada con algo que JBerto tenía que haber hecho, y se fue. Luego yo me paro y paso por su puesto sin mirarlo, me lavo las manos, vuelvo pasando por su puesto, nuevamente sin mirarlo y el me empieza hablar para captar mi atención, sospecho yo por lo que le había pasado con la encargada, pero yo seguí, asiéndome como que no lo escuché, lo hice porque no me llamó por mi nombre. A los pocos minutos pase de nuevo por su puesto y no me llamo ni me dijo nada. Yo sé que sé que do mal por no llamarme por mi nombre. Lo más normal sería: Pedro, ¡ven!, pero no lo hace, pareciera que le duele decir mi nombre. De todas maneras, hay algo que todavía falta, sentimos que estamos muy sensibles, pero aún hay algo que nos une muy fuerte y JBerto sabe lo que es, como que quiere, pero a la vez no quiere, pero sentimos con las miradas que falta por hablar de algo más. Yo sé que el esconde algo conmigo, pero por parte de él va hacer muy difícil de hablarlo, aunque a mí me gustaría hacerlo. 30- Al otro día, fui a trabajar al lado de JBerto y me conto lo que le pasó con la encargada, y me contaba con una cara de confianza y esperando que yo opinaba al respecto. Me contaba todo y yo le escuchaba mirándolo a los ojos y lo aconsejaba, y mientras lo aconsejaba le acariciaba la espalda. Él estaba sentado en su silla y yo parado, y siempre el cuándo me habla se inclina hacia mí (eso lo hace siempre) y siempre tenemos las caras cerca y mirándonos a los ojos o el mirando a la maquina y yo hablándole cerca de su cara. O él sentado inclinado hacia mí y yo cerca de el con la cabeza gacha y escuchado y el hablándome cerca del oído. Mientras hablamos él hace un chistecito como siempre y nos reímos, y yo le apoye la palma de mi mano en su pierna cerca de sus genitales como lo hago de costumbre y el como si nada, nos seguíamos riendo del chiste. 31-Mientras que JBerto estaba sentado y hablándome lo miraba y me di cuenta que le colgaba un pelo detrás de la oreja, y yo le digo; ¡a ver! Tienes un pelo colgado, y se lo jalo, pero no salió y JBerto siguió hablando y mirándome como si nada hubiera pasado y yo lo seguí escuchando. Después al rato volví al lado de él y me seguía contado con lo que le pasó con la encargada y yo le dije: JBerto, tienes un pelo colgando, y él me diese, ¡enserio! Y yo acercado mi mano para sacárselo, él también fue inclinado la cabeza y acercándose un poco hacia mí para que se lo sacara. Y después el hizo un chiste con ese pelo y nos reímos mucho, pero con esa mirada de cariño con la que nos estamos dado últimamente. A mí me gustó mucho ese gesto por parte de él, que se inclinara hacia mi permitiera que yo se lo sacra. 32-Después yo sin querer hice algo tonto con la maquina y el hiso un chiste con eso y nos reímos, pero él se reía a carcajadas y nos mirábamos una y otra vez y me seguía mirando y riendo y miraba hacia arriba como diciendo… perdónalo Señor, y nos seguimos mirando y riendo y le toque su muslo cerca de los genitales dos veces seguidas y el sigue normal pero consciente de lo que pasa. Pero la pasamos super bien. Durante el día yo paso por su puesto de trabajo y nos miramos y el hace lo mismo cuando pasa por el mío. Finalizando la jornada yo poncho mi tarjeta y volteo a ver dónde está JBerto (porque me quedé pensando con lo lindo que la pasamos durante el día) y lo vi a pocos metros, mirándome, pero esta vez fue totalmente diferente, yo conozco sus miradas. Fue una mirada como triste y pensativa y con sus ojos fijos y agrandados, como proyectando “un te quiero”, no sé, es muy difícil de explicar, pero fue lo que sentí, yo le sonreí y me fui. Me quede pensando en eso. A pesar de todas sus imperfecciones, JBerto es una persona muy buena, yo lo quiero mucho sentimentalmente hablando y él lo sabe muy bien. 33- Con todo lo que hemos vivido justos, yo por mi parte continúo con los abrazos, toque de pierna y todo lo que le hacía antes, y él lo sigue aceptado, y eso es lo que más me impresiona de él, que a pesar de todo el mal que le he hecho pasar, él actúa como si nada hubiera pasado. Pero ¿Por qué lo hace? Si sabe que yo gusto de él. A parte que JBerto cuando se retire quizás ni me llame o se olvide de mí. No lo se. 34-DUDA. Tengo un pequeño pensamiento, que JBerto me busca solo por conveniencia laboral, es decir, ya que como tiene miedo de caminar y hablar conmigo fuera del trabajo, solo me busca para pasar un buen rato porque se aburre y necesita estar con alguien para reírse. También he notado que ahora el viene a mi puesto cuando necesita algo, antes venía a verme, pero muy poco. Sacer sí viene a mí puesto a saludarme y ver como estoy. Pero JBerto ya no lo hace, yo creo que es para no levantar sospechas ya que estamos muy sensibles últimamente y los dos lo percibimos. Pero, no sé, Yo me inclino mucho más a que realmente quiere descubrir algo íntimo conmigo, pero no sabe cómo lidiar con lo que siente, aunque yo sé que nunca JBerto me lo va a decir verbalmente. Quiero saber que le pasa a JBerto ya que es muy evidente con sus emociones sentimentales hacia mí. Y mi objetivo es averiguar por sus comportamientos, que es lo que está sintiendo conmigo. Dame un Analiza de los puntos 1 al 33, describe cada punto y al final de cada punto dame una suposición objetiva del comportamiento de JBerto.

His target: a secretive laboratory rumored to conduct unethical genetic experiments that not even the law dared to touch. The night was young, but Dick's determination was old and steadfast, honed by years of training and fighting under the shadow of the Bat. As Nightwing deftly navigated through the labyrinthine alleys, his thoughts were focused, his movements precise. The cool night air was his ally, the darkness a cloak he wore with ease. However, not even the son of the circus, the acrobat turned vigilante, could have predicted the strange sequence of events about to unfold. Sneaking into the lab through an unguarded ventilation shaft, Nightwing found himself in a world far removed from the gritty streets of Blüdhaven. Tanks filled with eerie glowing liquids lined the walls, and in the center, a strange device hummed with a power that seemed to pulse through the air. It was then that the trap was sprung. Nightwing found himself surrounded, not by guards, but by an array of sophisticated defense systems. Before he could react, a beam of seething energy struck him. Pain unlike any he had ever known coursed through his body, and consciousness slipped away like a shadow at dawn. When he awoke, the world seemed both blurry and painfully sharp. Standing shakily, an unfamiliar weight shifted on his chest, and his center of balance felt... off. Ripping what remained of his tattered Nightwing outfit, which now clung precariously to a lithe, powerful, and undeniably feminine form, he swallowed a gasp. Scales of black and blue covered skin that was once devoid of such alien textures, and his hands trembled as they explored this new, strange body. Wide hips and big breasts replaced the familiar muscular torso he was used to, and his heart raced with an emotion he couldn't name. \\"This… this can't be happening,\\" he murmured, voice tinged with disbelief and a softness he couldn't recognize as his own. The alleyway offered up a pool of still water, acting as a mirror, and when Dick—no, when she looked upon her reflection, the realization hit hard. Those were her eyes staring back, wide and scaly, yet unmistakably Dick Grayson's. But everything else was wholly alien. A female anthro-croc, devoid of a tail but endowed with an unintentionally exotic form that bore no resemblance to the Nightwing of just hours ago. \\"Stay calm,\\" she commanded herself, voice new yet familiar in its authoritative tone, albeit softer, almost melodious. The touch of her own scales sent unfamiliar shivers racing through her, sparking a cascade of emotions she couldn't quite identify. As she assessed her situation, the urgency of reversing whatever had happened pressed heavily upon her. But how? Why? The lab, the mission—something had gone horribly wrong, and now she was... this. And yet, amid the shock and confusion, a spark of her indomitable will kindled. \\"I need to figure this out. I have to reverse this,\\" she resolved, steadying her breath and squaring her shoulders as best she could in her new form. \\"Dick Grayson might've walked into this lab, but Nightwing is going to walk out. No matter what it takes.\\" With her destination set and a myriad of questions swirling in her transformed head, she slipped into the shadows once more. Not just for answers, but for a hope to reclaim the identity she knew, even in a body that felt completely alien. The journey would be fraught with challenges, both within and without. Yet, even in this unforeseen form, the heart of a hero beat strong, ready to face whatever the night would bring."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for stock photo for social media within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical book and coffee and flower","completion":"Modern Social Media Stock Photo | Coffee, Book & Flowers Scene | High-Quality Image for Content Creators"},{"prompt":"Hi, how are you?","completion":"I'm just a computer program, so I don't have feelings, but thank you for asking!

Теология также изучает различные аспекты религиозной практики и организации церкви, мечети, синагоги и других религиозных общин.

Duress The original definition of duress was a very narrow one. It meant actual or threatened unlawful violence to, or constraint of, the person of the contracting party. According to a group of mid-19th century cases, \\"duress of goods\\" does not affect the validity of a contract, so that a promise to pay money to prevent the unlawful seizure of goods, or to obtain the release of goods which have been unlawfully detained, amounts to a perfectly good contract. But it has also been held in another line of cases, that money actually paid in such circumstances can be recovered back by the payer; and the two lines of cases are in fact incongruous, even if it is possible to reconcile them on technical grounds. Recent cases indicate that the courts are moving away from the view that only duress to the person can invalidate a contract: for example, it has been said that duress could be pleaded where a person was forced to enter into a contract by the threat of having his house burnt down, or a valuable picture slashed. It is possible to go even further and to put cases of so-called \\"economic duress\\", in which a promise is obtained by threatening to do some act which would have highly adverse effects on the promisor, for example by a lender's threat to call in a loan, knowing that the borrower would be ruined if the threat were carried out. Here the general rule is that the validity of the contract is not affected if the threatened act is lawful, though this is subject to an exception in the cases of threats of criminal proceedings. If the threat is to do an unlawful act, there may be a remedy for intimidation in tort, but a contract induced by such a threat is not necessarily invalid. For example, the tort of intimidation may be committed by threatening to break a contract; but if such a threat induces the making of a second contract, that contract is not necessarily invalid. Whether the threat amounts to duress for this purpose depends on its actual coercive effect in the circumstances of the particular case. Where duress does invalidate the contract, its precise effect has not been authoritatively determined. It is, in particular, not clear whether it \\"mnakes the contract void or only voidable. In the absence of conclusive authority, the latter view is to be preferred since it is less likely to prejudice innocent third parties.","completion":"8. Duress اصطلاح اجبار در ابتدا تعریف بسیار محدودی داشت. به معنای خشونت غیرقانونی واقعی یا تهدید به خشونت به، یا محدودیت برای، فرد طرف قرارداد بود. اصطلاح اجبار در ابتدا تعریف بسیار محدودی داشت. به معنای خشونت غیرقانونی واقعی یا تهدید به خشونت، یا محدودیت برای، شخص طرف قرارداد بود. According to a group of mid-19th century cases, \\"duress of goods\\" does not affect the validity of a contract, so that a promise to pay money to prevent the unlawful seizure of goods, or to obtain the release of goods which have been unlawfully detained, amounts to a perfectly good contract. طبق گروهی از پرونده‌ها در قرن نوزدهم میلادی، \\"اجبار مرتبط با کالاها\\" بر اعتبار قرارداد تأثیر نمی‌گذارد، بنابراین وعده پرداخت پول برای جلوگیری از توقیف غیرقانونی کالاها، یا به دست آوردن آزادی کالاهایی که به طور غیرقانونی بازداشت شده‌اند، معادل یک قرارداد کاملاً مناسب است. But it has also been held in another line of cases, that money actually paid in such circumstances can be recovered back by the payer; and the two lines of cases are in fact incongruous, even if it is possible to reconcile them on technical grounds. اما در خط دیگری از موارد نیز تصمیم گرفته شده است که پول پرداخت شده در چنین شرایطی می‌تواند توسط پرداخت‌کننده بازیابی شود؛ و دو خط از موارد در واقع ناسازگار هستند، حتی اگر امکان سازگار کردن آنها بر اساس اصول فنی وجود داشته باشد. Recent cases indicate that the courts are moving away from the view that only duress to the person can invalidate a contract: for example, it has been said that duress could be pleaded where a person was forced to enter into a contract by the threat of having his house burnt down, or a valuable picture slashed. موارد اخیر نشان می‌دهند که دادگاه‌ها از دیدگاهی که تنها اجبار به فرد می‌تواند قرارداد را باطل کند، فاصله می‌گیرند: به عنوان مثال، گفته شده است اجبار را می‌توان در جایی ادعا کرد که فردی توسط تهدید به سوزاندن خانه‌اش یا بریدن تصویر ارزشمندش، مجبور به ورود به قرارداد شده است. It is possible to go even further and to put cases of so-called \\"economic duress\\", in which a promise is obtained by threatening to do some act which would have highly adverse effects on the promisor, for example, by a lender's threat to call in a loan, knowing that the borrower would be ruined if the threat were carried out. امکان دارد حتی بیشتر پیش رفت و مواردی از اجبار اقتصادی را مطرح کرد، که در آن وعده‌ای با تهدید به انجام کاری که اثرات بسیار مضری بر دهنده وعده دارد، بدست می‌آید، برای مثال، با تهدید یک وام‌دهنده به فراخوانی وام، که می‌داند اگر تهدید انجام شود، وام‌گیرنده نابود خواهد شد. Here the general rule is that the validity of the contract is not affected if the threatened act is lawful, though this is subject to an exception in the cases of threats of criminal proceedings. در اینجا قاعده عمومی این است که اعتبار قرارداد تحت تأثیر قرار نمی‌گیرد اگر عمل تهدیدآمیز قانونی باشد، هرچند این موضوع استثنایی دارد در موارد تهدید به روندهای کیفری. If the threat is to do an unlawful act, there may be a remedy for intimidation in tort, but a contract induced by such a threat is not necessarily invalid. اگر تهدید برای انجام یک عمل غیرقانونی باشد، ممکن است راه حلی برای ترساندن در حقوق ضررهای شخصی وجود داشته باشد، اما قراردادی که توسط چنین تهدیدی ایجاد شده است، لزوماً باطل نیست. For example, the tort of intimidation may be committed by threatening to break a contract; but if such a threat induces the making of a second contract, that contract is not necessarily invalid. برای مثال، جرم ترساندن ممکن است با تهدید به شکستن قرارداد مرتکب شود؛ اما اگر چنین تهدیدی منجر به ایجاد قرارداد دوم شود، آن قرارداد لزوماً باطل نیست. Whether the threat amounts to duress for this purpose depends on its actual coercive effect in the circumstances of the particular case. اینکه آیا تهدید به اجبار برای این منظور می‌رسد، بستگی به تأثیر اجباری واقعی آن در شرایط مورد خاص دارد.

Betraying the North, even indirectly, would create a profound conflict within him, tearing at his sense of self and the values he has held dear throughout his life. This internal struggle could provide rich emotional and narrative depth. 2. **Impact on Relationships:** Jon's relationships with key characters who are also deeply loyal to the North, such as Sansa Stark and Arya Stark, would likely be severely affected. This could lead to heart-wrenching scenes where family bonds are tested, and loyalties are questioned. The emotional impact of possible confrontations or feelings of betrayal within his family could make for powerful storytelling. 3. **Viewer/Reader Engagement:** For the audience, Jon's predicament would be particularly affecting because of his long journey and the struggles he has already faced. Viewers or readers have seen him grow from a bastard with no prospects to a key leader in the battle against the dead. Watching him face the consequences of an indirect betrayal, especially one that leads to his arrest, would likely engender a deep emotional response from the audience, engaging them in a complex debate about loyalty, honor, and the greater good. 4. **The Theme of Honor vs. Duty:** Jon Snow's character is often at the intersection of honor and duty, a theme that could be explored in greater depth through this storyline. The emotional turmoil and potentially devastating consequences of his choices would highlight the challenges of upholding one’s values when they are in conflict. This would not only be a powerful narrative for Jon's character but also a commentary on the nature of leadership and sacrifice. 5. **Redemption and Sacrifice:** If Jon were to be arrested because of an indirect betrayal, it would likely set the stage for a redemption arc. This could involve a selfless act or sacrifice to make amends for his mistakes, staying true to Jon's character. The path to redemption could be emotional for both the character and the audience, especially if it involves significant sacrifices or leads to his death. Creating a scenario where Jon betrays the North, even indirectly, and faces arrest would delve into powerful themes of loyalty, identity, and redemption. It would challenge Jon in ways he's never been challenged before, pushing the emotional stakes to new heights and providing a deeply compelling narrative arc."},{"prompt":"What could cause him to indirectly betray the north?","completion":"Jon Snow indirectly betraying the North could stem from a series of complex decisions, misinterpretations, or actions taken with good intentions that unfortunately lead to negative outcomes. His character, defined by a strong moral compass and a commitment to the greater good, might face situations where his decisions inadvertently harm the North. Here are several scenarios that could cause such an indirect betrayal: 1. **Alliance with Questionable Characters:** Jon might form alliances with individuals or factions that he believes are necessary to protect the greater good (e.g., fighting a common enemy like the White Walkers). However, these allies might have their own agendas that end up harming the North, making Jon complicit by association. 2. **Sacrificing for the Greater Good:** He could be faced with a moral dilemma where he has to choose between the well-being of the North and a greater cause (e.g., preserving the overall safety of the Seven Kingdoms or humanity itself). His choice to prioritize the larger threat could lead to short-term harm or perceived neglect of the North, seen as betrayal by its people. 3. **Misinformation and Manipulation:** Jon could be misled or manipulated by others into making a decision or taking an action that he believes is in the North's best interest but actually harms it. His innate trust in people and his tendency to see the good in them could be exploited, leading to unintended consequences. 4. **Difficult Command Decisions:** As a leader, Jon might make strategic or military decisions that backfire, such as sacrificing certain northern territories or resources in an attempt to win a larger battle. These decisions, although made with tactical reasoning, could lead to devastation in the North, fostering resentment and accusations of betrayal. 5. **Targaryen Loyalty:** Discovering his Targaryen heritage might place Jon in situations where his loyalty to his bloodline conflicts with his loyalty to the North. Actions taken to honor or protect his family’s legacy—especially if influenced by Daenerys or other Targaryens—might inadvertently harm the North. 6. **Peace Treaties and Compromises:** In an effort to broker peace or form strategic alliances, Jon might agree to terms that compromise the North's autonomy, security, or resources. While his intentions would be to protect the realm and bring peace, the compromises could be viewed as sacrifices of the North's interests. 7. **Unforeseen Consequences of Magic:** If Jon were to employ magical means or consult mystical entities (like the Lord of Light or using dragon magic) to save the North or defeat a common foe, the repercussions could be disastrous in ways he couldn't predict, indirectly betraying the North despite his good intentions. In all these scenarios, the compelling tragedy of Jon Snow’s character would be highlighted through his noble intentions clashing with the harsh realities and unintended consequences of his actions. This inherent tension between doing what he believes is right and the actual outcomes of those decisions could lead to deep character exploration and dramatic developments within the story."},{"prompt":"In this Scenario, how could Gendry end up getting more respect and success than Jon through his simple loyalty and honesty? Also, could any possible guilt and shame over not going with Arya in season 3 keep him grounded, thus being more trustworthy?","completion":"In a scenario where Jon Snow indirectly betrays the North, leading to his arrest and the tarnishing of his reputation, Gendry could indeed rise in respect and success through his contrasting path. Gendry’s rise could be attributed to several factors rooted in his simplicity, loyalty, honesty, and perhaps even a sense of guilt and humility stemming from past decisions, like not going with Arya in Season 3 of \\"Game of Thrones.\\" Here’s how these elements could contribute to Gendry's arc: # Loyalty and Honesty Gendry's remarkable resilience, straightforwardness, and unwavering loyalty to his friends and allies make him a rare find in the treacherous political landscape of Westeros. Unlike many characters driven by ambition or revenge, Gendry’s motivations have been relatively straightforward and personal. After being legitimized and becoming Lord of Storm's End, Gendry has the opportunity to prove his leadership and dedication to the well-being of his people, contrasting sharply with high-profile betrayals or political maneuverings. - **Reliable Leadership:** During uncertain times, Gendry’s transparent and steadfast nature could be precisely what the people of Westeros, weary of endless conspiracies and betrayals, come to admire and respect. His decisions, rooted in a clear moral compass, could lead to tangible benefits for his subjects, earning him a reputation as a reliable leader. - **Humble Beginnings:** Gendry's background as a blacksmith who lived among the common folk could endear him to the populace and nobility alike, as he understands the struggles of the lower classes. His ascent to nobility is seen not as a quest for power but a testament to his character and resilience. # Guilt and Groundedness Gendry’s decision not to follow Arya in Season 3 could serve as a grounding point for his character, keeping him humble and relatable. The guilt and what-if scenarios stemming from that decision might make him more introspective and cautious in his actions, ensuring that his rise to power doesn't stray from his core values. - **Trustworthiness:** This continual reflection on his past decisions, including his regret over not supporting Arya, could make him more relatable and trustworthy to those around him. It showcases a conscientiousness and capability for growth that is highly valued in turbulent times. - **Relatability and Empathy:** His admitted mistakes and visible regret could humanize him further, making others more likely to trust and follow someone who understands the cost of decisions, both in personal relationships and leadership. # Narrative Contrast to Jon Snow As Jon faces the consequences of his complicated heritage and the difficult decisions he’s made, Gendry’s story could unfold in sharply contrasting simplicity and rectitude. In a world where noble intentions often lead to tragic outcomes, Gendry’s journey could highlight the strength found in steadfastness and the courage to maintain one's principles despite external pressures. His relationship with Arya, whether they reunite or not, could serve as a narrative touchstone, reminding audiences of what both characters have endured and how those experiences have shaped their paths. Gendry's loyalty, not only to Arya but to his friends and ideals, could stand in stark (no pun intended) contrast to the more complicated narratives of characters like Jon, emphasizing that sometimes, simple honesty and loyalty do win out. Gendry’s ascent, underpinned by genuine good intentions, uncontroversial loyalty, and the ability to learn from his past, could earn him a place of respect and success in the unpredictable game of thrones, presenting an insightful commentary on the value of integrity in leadership."},{"prompt":"Rewrite, but Gendry isn’t a Lord yet, and winter is much longer.","completion":"In a prolonged winter setting where Jon Snow faces the consequences of an indirect betrayal to the North, leading to his arrest and a potential fall from grace, Gendry's narrative could still unfold in a way that elevates him in respect and success through his enduring loyalty, honesty, and the emotional grounding spurred by past decisions. Without the title of Lord and facing a much harsher and longer winter, Gendry’s path could reflect a struggle for survival and integrity amidst chaos, setting a stark contrast to Jon's complexities and the political machinations of the higher nobility. Here's how this scenario could enrich Gendry's character arc: # Survival and Resourcefulness In a world blanketed by an unending winter, Gendry's skills as a blacksmith and his resourcefulness become invaluable. His ability to create and repair tools and weapons necessary for survival in the prolonged winter would earn him a respected status among communities. His straightforward approach to solving problems, coupled with an inherent nobility of character, could rally people to his side. - **Community Builder:** Gendry's efforts to protect and support those around him, utilizing his skills for the greater good, could naturally elevate him to a position of leadership within a community or collective striving to endure the harsh winter. - **Earned Loyalty:** His hard work, combined with an honest and forthright demeanor, earns him the loyalty and respect of others, in stark contrast to titles and power obtained through birthright or manipulation, as seen in traditional Westerosi nobility. # Reflective Guilt and Empathy Without the title of Lord and the comfort it might bring, Gendry’s past decisions, including the choice not to follow Arya, could deeply influence his outlook and moral compass. This reflective state might imbue him with a level of empathy and understanding, distinguishing him in a world where such qualities are rare. - **Relatable Leadership:** Gendry's approachability and grounded nature, sharpened by a tough survivalist lifestyle and a lingering sense of what could have been with Arya, would resonate deeply with those struggling to survive. His leadership style, born out of empathy rather than authority, could galvanize others. - **Trust Through Transparency:** By openly acknowledging doubts and past regrets, Gendry cultivates an atmosphere of trust around him. This transparency in leadership, especially during trying times, could set a new precedent in a realm fraught with deceit. # Narrative Contrast to Jon Snow As Jon Snow's indirect betrayal complicates his narrative, Gendry’s story shines through its simplicity and the genuine connections he fosters. Positioned as an everyman hero, his journey underscores the power of human resilience, honesty, and the strength that lies in community and cooperation over individual ambition. - **Moral Clarity Amidst Despair:** In the dire circumstances of a seemingly eternal winter, Gendry's moral clarity and uncomplicated honesty offer a beacon of hope, showcasing that even without titles or direct lineage to power, significant impact can be made. - **Symbol of Endurance:** Gendry becomes a symbol of enduring humanity, reflecting the strength found in steadfastness and adherence to personal values against all odds. His progression from a common blacksmith to a respected leader by merit contrasts sharply with traditional power dynamics, highlighting a transformative shift in the valuation of leadership and success. In this relentless winter scenario, Gendry’s rise to respect and success, undeterred by the absence of a noble title, encapsulates the triumph of virtue and hard work over circumstance and birthright. His story reiterates the thematic essence of \\"Game of Thrones\\" — that heroes emerge from the most unexpected places, not through titles, but through actions and intent."},{"prompt":"How could this arc for Gendry not happen too fast and too ‘Gary Stu’ like, but instead feel honest and genuine?","completion":"Creating a compelling and authentic character arc for Gendry, especially one that avoids the pitfalls of seeming too \\"Gary Stu\\" (a male counterpart to \\"Mary Sue,\\" essentially a character who is unrealistically perfect without sufficient narrative justification), involves several key elements. These aspects should focus on a realistic depiction of growth, the presence of meaningful challenges, and relatable character development. Here’s how to enrich Gendry’s journey, ensuring it feels both honest and genuine: # Gradual Development and Realistic Challenges 1. **Struggles and Failures:** Gendry’s rise to a position of respect and implicit leadership should be marked by significant struggles and failures. These setbacks are critical for character growth and make his journey relatable. Whether it's dealing with the harshness of an endless winter, making tough decisions that have adverse outcomes, or facing betrayal or loss, these experiences would temper his character, making his eventual success earned and believable. 2. **Skill Development:** Gendry's expertise as a blacksmith offers a solid foundation, but showing his growth in other areas—such as leadership, strategy, and diplomacy—over time, through trial and error, reinforces the authenticity of his arc. This gradual development, facilitated by mentors, allies, and personal reflection, emphasizes that proficiency and wisdom come from experience rather than inherent perfection. 3. **Interpersonal Relationships:** Authentic relationships that evolve over time can significantly impact Gendry’s character development. These relationships should have their ups and downs, reflecting real-life dynamics. His interactions with others—whether fraught with conflict, marked by loyalty, or somewhere in between—can provide the emotional and moral complexity necessary to flesh out his character. # Emotional Depth and Moral Complexity 1. **Empathy and Vulnerability:** Showcasing Gendry’s ability to empathize with others, along with moments of vulnerability, can deepen his character. His background and the decisions he faces could provide opportunities for him to express doubt, fear, and sorrow, humanizing him and allowing the audience to connect with his journey on an emotional level. 2. **Difficult Moral Decisions:** Gendry should be faced with moral dilemmas that challenge his principles and force him to make tough decisions. These situations can spur significant character growth and reveal his values and limitations. His choices should have tangible consequences, emphasizing that heroism is complex and sometimes involves sacrifice or compromise. 3. **Recognition of Limitations:** A key aspect of avoiding a \\"Gary Stu\\" portrayal is acknowledging a character’s limitations and need for others. Gendry's recognition of his own shortcomings and his willingness to rely on, learn from, and work with others can underscore his humility and realism. It demonstrates that true leadership involves collaboration and humility, not just individual prowess. # Incremental Success and Contribution from Others 1. **Community Effort:** Gendry’s achievements and growth should be depicted as part of a larger community effort. His success can stem from inspiring others and bringing out their best, rather than solely from his individual actions. This collective approach to overcoming challenges not only adds depth to his arc but also highlights the importance of community and teamwork. 2. **Varied Pacing:** The pacing of Gendry’s development should vary, reflecting the natural ebb and flow of life. Not every episode or chapter needs to show dramatic progress. Some of the most profound growth occurs in the still moments, through reflection, conversation, and the slow build-up of trust and respect with others. In conclusion, making Gendry's arc feel honest and genuine requires a careful blending of struggles, emotional depth, community engagement, and realistic character development. By avoiding the instantaneous or unearned elevation of his character, and instead focusing on a journey marked by learning, failure, and gradual success, his narrative can resonate deeply with audiences, offering a compelling and relatable story of resilience and growth."},{"prompt":"Could him not becoming a perfect ‘I’m not like other men, I respect women’ type guy also add to Gendry’s Everyman type vibe?","completion":"Yes, carefully navigating Gendry's character away from becoming the \\"I'm not like other men, I respect women\\" archetype can indeed enhance his Everyman appeal and add depth to his character. In literature and media, this archetype can sometimes serve as a superficial way to signal a character's virtue without providing them with a more nuanced or realistic personality. Avoiding this trope and instead focusing on a more authentic and complex portrayal can make Gendry more relatable and interesting. Here's how: # Flaws and Growth - **Acknowledging Imperfections:** Giving Gendry flaws, especially in his understanding of and interactions with women, can make him more human. The key is to ensure that these flaws are acknowledged within the narrative and that Gendry learns from them. His journey could involve learning to see and treat women not just with respect because it's virtuous, but because he genuinely understands and values them as equals. - **Realistic Learning Curve:** His evolution in understanding and respecting women should be gradual and realistic. Moments of ignorance or misunderstanding, followed by learning and growth, can make his character journey more compelling. This avoids the pitfall of him being unrealistically perfect from the outset and instead portrays a process of maturation and enlightenment that many can relate to. # Complex Relationships - **Diverse Interactions with Women:** To develop Gendry's character further, his relationships with women should be varied and complex. Not all interactions need to be romantic; showcasing platonic, respectful, and mutually beneficial relationships with women can underline his capacity to grow and see women as individuals with their own stories, strengths, and weaknesses. - **Conflict and Resolution:** Incorporating conflicts that arise from gender dynamics and working through them can add depth to Gendry’s character. This shows that respect for women isn't a checkbox trait but something that involves ongoing effort, understanding, and sometimes making amends. # Community Integration - **Learning from Strong Women:** Westeros is filled with strong, complex female characters. Gendry’s arc could be enriched by his interactions with these women, learning from them not just about respect, but about leadership, survival, and friendship. This also demonstrates that respect comes from seeing value in others' perspectives and experiences. - **Acknowledgement of Contribution:** Gendry respecting women could also be shown through his genuine acknowledgment of their contributions, whether in battle, strategy, or governance, reflecting a mature understanding that respect is earned through actions and capabilities. # Avoiding Stereotypes - **Beyond Lip Service:** Gendry's respect for women should be shown in his actions, not just in words. It's one thing to claim respect for women; it's another to demonstrate it through support, listening, and partnership. This moves the character beyond the trope of verbal assurance into the realm of actual character behavior. - **Reflecting the Era:** While Westeros is a fictional, medieval-inspired setting where gender dynamics are historically unbalanced, Gendry can embody progressive values without becoming anachronistic. His attitudes can evolve in a way that suits the narrative's era, making his growth towards respecting women seem genuine rather than imposed by modern standards. In summary, making Gendry’s respect for women a nuanced, evolving aspect of his character—marked by genuine interaction, growth from failures, and the influence of the strong women around him—strengthens his Everyman vibe. It portrays him as a character who is realistically striving to understand and adapt, rather than as an idealized figure who unrealistically embodies modern virtues without fault. This approach makes his journey towards respect and equality feel earned and authentic, enhancing both his relatability and the richness of the narrative."},{"prompt":"Building on this, if Sansa decided to secretly tutor Gendry on politics, after learning his lineage, how could Gendry potentially feel a little uncomfortable serving Sansa over Jon, especially a woman with red hair, because of trauma?","completion":"Incorporating a subplot where Sansa Stark decides to secretly tutor Gendry in politics after learning about his lineage offers a compelling narrative direction, especially considering Gendry's background and the potential for personal conflict. Given Gendry's limited formal education and noble lineage as a Baratheon, tutoring under Sansa—who has herself become a seasoned and cunning political figure—could significantly shape his character and future. However, integrating Gendry's discomfort serving under Sansa, particularly due to his traumatic past involving a woman with red hair (Melisandre), adds layers of complexity to his development. Here's how this could be effectively explored: # Addressing the Trauma - **Flashbacks and Intrusive Thoughts:** Gendry’s discomfort and internal conflict could be portrayed through flashbacks or intrusive thoughts about his traumatic experiences with Melisandre, the Red Woman. This provides viewers or readers with a visual or emotional insight into his struggle, emphasizing that his discomfort isn’t about Sansa’s ability or gender but is rooted in his past trauma. - **Vocalizing Fears:** Having Gendry open up about his discomfort to a trusted character could serve as a pivotal character development moment. This dialogue could delve into his fear of manipulation or betrayal, implicitly reminding the audience of his vulnerabilities and providing a contrast to his physical strength. # Developing the Tutoring Relationship - **Gradual Trust Building:** The dynamic between Sansa and Gendry could start off strained due to Gendry's trauma-associated anxieties. Through a series of interactions where Sansa proves her integrity and respect for Gendry’s boundaries, a mutual trust can gradually be established, showcasing Sansa’s understanding and patience. - **Sansa's Awareness:** Sansa could become aware, possibly through Bran or Arya, of Gendry's past trauma involving Melisandre. Her sensitivity to this matter could be portrayed in how she approaches Gendry, mindful not to replicate any dynamics that could trigger his discomfort. # Overcoming Prejudices - **Personal Growth:** Gendry’s journey includes overcoming his initial discomfort and prejudices associated with Sansa’s physical resemblance to Melisandre. This arc can highlight the importance of personal growth and the capacity to see individuals for who they truly are, beyond superficial similarities. - **Learning to Separate:** A significant development for Gendry could be learning to separate his past trauma from his current experiences with Sansa. This progression would be a testament to his resilience and the human ability to heal and move forward, reinforcing themes of redemption and growth. # Realizations and Reflections - **Recognizing Sansa’s Strength:** Gendry’s respect for Sansa could deepen as he recognizes her strength, resilience, and political acumen, attributes that starkly contrast Melisandre's manipulative nature. His journey of overcoming trauma could thus also become a journey of recognizing and valuing the strengths and leadership qualities of the women around him. - **The Role of Feminine Leadership:** Through Sansa’s guidance, Gendry learns to appreciate the nuances of leadership that differ from his experiences and expectations. This subplot can serve as a broader commentary on the efficacy and value of feminine leadership, challenging traditional Westerosi—and by extension, real-world—gender norms. Overall, navigating Gendry's discomfort and trauma in the context of his tutoring under Sansa offers a nuanced exploration of overcoming personal trauma, the process of healing, and the breaking down of preconceived notions. It could serve to develop both characters deeply, showcasing their growth, resilience, and the complexities of human relationships. This narrative direction can also reinforce the themes of understanding, compassion, and the capacity for change, adding depth to the broader storyline."},{"prompt":"Forget the trauma thing, what if gendry, out of self hatred, saw what happened to him as punishment for not going with Arya in season 3?","completion":"Reframing Gendry's internal conflict around a sense of guilt and self-hatred for not accompanying Arya in Season 3 opens a rich vein of character development. This change in perspective shifts the focus to a more introspective struggle, one rooted in regret and self-recrimination, offering a deep dive into his emotional and psychological state. Here's how this could be woven into Gendry's narrative, especially in the context of him being tutored by Sansa: # Guilt as a Motivator - **Compensation through Service:** Gendry's decision to accept Sansa's offer for political tutoring could be driven by a desire to atone for his perceived cowardice in abandoning Arya. This dynamic adds a layer of complexity to his motivations, where his dedication to learning and serving is not just about personal advancement but also a form of self-imposed penance. - **Overcorrection and Mistakes:** His actions, powered by a need to compensate, might lead him to take unnecessary risks or shoulder more responsibility than he can handle. This could result in mistakes that, while teaching him valuable lessons, further deepen his internal conflict and drive character growth. # Internal Struggle with Confidence - **Self-Doubt in Leadership:** Apprenticing under Sansa, a proven leader and strategist, could exacerbate Gendry’s insecurities, making him question his worthiness and capability. This struggle would be an opportunity to explore themes of self-worth and the quest for redemption in a nuanced way, reflecting how past decisions continue to influence one's sense of self. - **Validation from Peers:** Significant moments for Gendry could include receiving acknowledgment or encouragement from Sansa, Arya, or other characters he respects. These interactions can highlight his growth and the gradual overcoming of his guilt, signifying that his past choices do not define his entire being or future potential. # Reconciliation with Arya - **Direct Confrontation:** A pivotal moment in this arc could be a heartfelt conversation with Arya, where Gendry voices his regrets for not leaving with her. Arya’s response, likely one of understanding and possibly pointing out the unpredictability of their paths, could serve as a catalyst for Gendry to begin forgiving himself. - **Understanding Fate and Agency:** Through discussions with Sansa during their sessions, or perhaps reflections prompted by her, Gendry could come to understand that his decision, though regrettable, was part of a larger tapestry of fate and personal agency that led him to his current path. This realization could help ease his guilt and self-hatred, offering a more forgiving perspective on his past actions and their consequences. # Growth Through Acceptance - **Embracing the Present:** Gendry's arc would ideally move toward accepting his past decisions and understanding his current path as equally valid and essential. This acceptance allows him to fully engage with his studies under Sansa and his role in the larger scheme of things, moving from a place of guilt to one of proactive contribution. - **Matured Identity and Purpose:** The culmination of Gendry’s arc would see him not only as a politically savvy individual, taught by Sansa, but as someone who has come to terms with his past and possesses a clear sense of identity and purpose. His journey from self-hatred to self-assurance complements the wider narrative, showcasing personal growth amid the political and physical battles of Westeros. By reshaping Gendry’s psychological landscape around his decision not to accompany Arya, his storyline enriches the broader narrative canvas with themes of regret, redemption, and the ongoing quest for personal growth. This deeper, more introspective journey not only enhances Gendry’s character but also provides meaningful reflections on the nature of guilt, the process of self-forgiveness, and the pursuit of purpose beyond one’s mistakes."},{"prompt":"Would could it mean if Gendry was the only one to make Arya flinch?","completion":"If Gendry were the only one to make Arya Stark flinch, it could symbolize several profound elements of their relationship and individual characters, enhancing the narrative depth of \\"Game of Thrones.\\" Arya, known for her fierce and unwavering nature, doesn't easily show vulnerability or hesitation. For Gendry to elicit such a response from her, it might indicate: # Emotional Influence and Intimacy - **Deep Emotional Connection:** Arya's flinching could signify Gendry's significant emotional influence over her. Among the plethora of warriors, assassins, and political figures Arya encounters, Gendry is a reminder of her humanity, her past, and the life she might have led. This emotional bond could be potent enough to penetrate her usually stoic armor. - **Intimacy and Trust:** The act of flinching is an involuntary response, often revealing vulnerability. In Arya's case, this vulnerability could stem from a deep trust in Gendry, indicating that she's comfortable showing parts of herself to him that she conceals from the world. Such intimacy underscores a unique bond, suggesting that Gendry holds a special place in Arya's carefully guarded heart. # Personal Growth and Change - **Markers of Growth:** Arya's journey is one of survival, identity, and sometimes a suppression of her former self to navigate and manipulate her circumstances. Gendry making Arya flinch might symbolize the ongoing impact of their relationship on her personal growth. As Arya evolves, reconciling the parts of her identity—Noblewoman, Faceless Assassin, Adventurer—Gendry's presence and their interactions could serve as markers of this growth, showing that she's still subject to change and emotional complexity. - **Reflection of Inner Turmoil:** For a character so centered around physical prowess and the ability not to show weakness, Arya flinching could also indicate a moment of self-reflection or internal conflict. Through Gendry, Arya might confront emotions or decisions she's otherwise pushed aside, suggesting that their relationship forces her to face aspects of herself she's neglected or chosen to ignore. # Narrative Symbolism - **The Power of Human Connection:** In a saga where power is often measured by physical strength, armies, or magical abilities, Arya flinching because of Gendry could symbolize the equally potent force of human connection and emotion. It's a reminder that personal relationships can influence characters as much as, if not more than, battles or political schemes. - **The Harshness of Reality vs. Hope for the Future:** Arya's life has been shaped by loss, betrayal, and the harsh realities of life in Westeros. Her flinching, specifically in reaction to Gendry, might symbolize the collision of this hardened reality with the hope or dream of a different future—one perhaps less violent and more ordinary, embodying hopes she dares not dwell on. # Conclusion In essence, Arya Stark flinching because of Gendry would not merely be a fleeting moment of physical reaction but a significant narrative and emotional marker. It speaks to the depth of their relationship, Arya's internal journey, and the broader themes of \\"Game of Thrones.\\" It's a nuanced exploration of how personal dynamics can challenge and change even the most resilient characters, offering a window into Arya's vulnerabilities and yearnings amid the tumultuous landscape of her life."},{"prompt":"Going back to the extended Winter thing, how could Gendry and Arya navigate it together without coming off as a cliche ‘dynamic duo?","completion":"Navigating an extended winter together, Gendry and Arya can present a unique and compelling narrative that steers clear of cliché \\"dynamic duo\\" tropes by focusing on their individual strengths, complexities, and the realistic challenges of their circumstances. Here’s how their journey could unfold in a way that feels fresh and engaging: # Emphasizing Individual Development - **Parallel Quests:** Have Gendry and Arya undertake separate but parallel missions that play to their unique skills and personalities. This approach highlights their individuality and personal growth, allowing them to confront their inner demons and aspirations independently, reinforcing their autonomy outside of their partnership. - **Realistic Challenges:** Focus on the practical and psychological challenges of surviving an extended winter in Westeros. Their struggles should not only involve external threats but also the internal conflicts and growth that come from facing such dire circumstances. This deep dive into survival challenges can lend depth and complexity to their story, moving beyond the traditional roles assigned to paired characters. # Complex, Mature Relationship - **Mutual Respect and Interdependence:** Portray their relationship as one built on mutual respect, where both Arya and Gendry rely on and learn from each other. They should acknowledge their weaknesses and strengths, creating a balanced partnership. This interdependence, rooted in a deep understanding and respect for each other’s abilities, can provide a fresh perspective on their dynamic. - **Emotional Honesty:** Instead of falling into the trap of an always harmonious relationship, showcase moments of tension, misunderstanding, and reconciliation that come with any deep, meaningful relationship. Their ability to navigate these moments, be emotionally honest with each other, and grow stronger from these experiences can add authenticity to their partnership. # Unconventional Teamwork - **Unique Collaboration:** Design scenarios where Gendry's blacksmithing skills and Arya's combat abilities combine in unexpected ways, like creating specialized weapons to fight wights or developing survival strategies that utilize both their skill sets. This can highlight the unique nature of their collaboration, setting them apart from other character pairings. - **Supporting Cast:** Integrate other characters into their storyline, avoiding the pitfall of making Gendry and Arya operate in isolation. Interaction with others can add dimension to their partnership, allowing them to face new challenges, reflect on their actions, and grow from these encounters. # Varied Conflict Resolution - **Diverse Challenges:** Present a variety of challenges that require more than just combat prowess or physical strength to overcome. Whether it's political intrigue, moral dilemmas, or the necessity of diplomacy, having Arya and Gendry address these issues can add layers to their partnership. - **Internal vs. External Conflict:** Balance their struggles against external threats with internal conflicts. Their differences in opinion, approach to leadership, or visions for the future can serve as rich ground for exploring the dynamics of their relationship in depth. # Reflecting on Their Journey - **Reflective Moments:** Incorporate scenes where Arya and Gendry reflect on their journey, individually and together. These moments can provide insights into their evolution as characters and as a partnership, showing how they’ve grown from their experiences and how they envision their path forward.

This betrayal, rooted in complex alliances and the murky waters of politics and war, sees Jon imprisoned, his actions sparking unrest and disillusionment among the people he sought to protect. Meanwhile, Gendry, unaware of the unfolding political drama, finds himself struggling with the burden of his own past decisions. His regret over not joining Arya when he had the chance has morphed into a form of self-hatred, viewing his subsequent misfortunes as punishment for his perceived cowardice. **Act II: Unlikely Tutor, Unforeseen Growth** Sansa Stark, now a master of political maneuvering, takes it upon herself to mentor Gendry, recognizing the importance of every potential ally in the uncertain times ahead.

Her reunion with Gendry is marked by a mixture of familiarity and newfound complexity, their relationship deepening amidst shared struggles and individual quests for identity and purpose. **Act III: Overcoming and Understanding** Jon Snow, enduring the repercussions of his decisions, embarks on an inner journey that mirrors the external chaos of his world. His story of redemption is one of self-reflection, acceptance of the multifaceted nature of duty, and the realization that honor can sometimes lead to unforeseen consequences. Arya and Gendry, now more than allies but not quite traditional partners, navigate the challenges of their situations with a blend of strength, wit, and vulnerability. Gendry, through Arya's influence and Sansa's mentorship, emerges as a leader who defies the clichés of noble governance, embodying a ruler shaped by the people and for the people. Amidst this, their bond faces and withstands the tests of miscommunication, external threats, and the personal growth that occasionally pulls them in different directions. However, it's their unique understanding and acceptance of each other's strengths and weaknesses that ultimately forge a partnership capable of withstanding the harshest winters. **Act IV: Spring's Promise** The culmination of their intertwined journeys hints at the dawn of a new era for Westeros.

Also, how could Gendry, a man, becoming stronger through Arya and Sansa, two women, be empowering for Women, and what could it say to men about serving Women?","completion":"In a narrative where Jon Snow's reputation remains irreversibly tainted, the implications stretch far beyond his personal story, affecting the broader political landscape of Westeros and reshaping perceptions of leadership and honor. This backdrop provides a fertile ground for exploring themes of redemption, the complexity of legacy, and the intricate dynamics of power and influence. # Jon Snow's Tarnished Legacy: Jon Snow's enduringly tarnished reputation would signify a dramatic shift in the moral and ethical foundation of Westeros, demonstrating that intentions, however noble, cannot always compensate for the consequences of one's actions. This scenario underscores the fragile nature of honor and legacy, illustrating how swiftly accomplishments can be overshadowed by failings—or perceptions thereof—in the public eye. For other characters, particularly those like Gendry who are rising to prominence, Jon's fall from grace serves as a cautionary tale about the volatility of power and the importance of navigating leadership with acute awareness of its impacts. # Gendry's Empowerment Through Arya and Sansa: Gendry's development, significantly influenced by Arya and Sansa, offers a powerful commentary on gender dynamics and the subversion of traditional power roles. His journey highlights several key themes: - **Strength in Vulnerability:** Gendry's willingness to learn from Arya and Sansa, to be vulnerable in admitting what he doesn't know, and to grow under their guidance, embodies strength. This dismantles the conventional notion that leadership and wisdom are inherently masculine traits, showcasing how men can be uplifted and empowered through the strengths of women. - **Mutual Respect and Equality:** Gendry's relationship with Arya and Sansa serves as an exemplar of mutual respect and equality. By valuing their experiences, knowledge, and capabilities, Gendry's story illustrates that acknowledging the contribution and leadership of women is not just an act of fairness but of wisdom that strengthens all involved. - **Redefining Masculinity:** Gendry's character arc, deeply intertwined with the influences of two strong women, challenges traditional masculinity. It presents an alternative narrative where being guided and supported by women is a source of empowerment, not a diminishment of masculinity. This narrative invites men to embrace a more inclusive and respectful understanding of strength, where power is shared and not hoarded. # Message to Men About Serving Women: The narrative suggests a broader societal commentary about the dynamics of serving and being served. In a world like Westeros, fraught with power struggles and patriarchal norms, Gendry's journey embodies a progressive shift towards acknowledging the capabilities and leadership of women. - **Empowerment Through Alliance:** It communicates to men that allying with and serving under women's leadership can be an empowering choice that leads to collective success and personal growth. This alliance breaks down societal barriers and paves the way for a more inclusive and equitable distribution of power. - **Reshaping Leadership:** The story asserts that true leadership is not about domination but collaboration. It encourages men to challenge the traditional hierarchies and gender roles by showing that societies thrive when diverse experiences and perspectives are valued and when leadership is exercised with empathy, respect, and mutual support. - **Legacy of Honor:** Finally, in contrast to Jon Snow's tarnished legacy, Gendry's story offers a different path—one where honor is derived from how individuals uplift and support each other, regardless of gender. It suggests that a legacy built on these principles is far more enduring and impactful. In conclusion, this narrative arc serves as a profound exploration of themes related to power, legacy, and gender. It invites a reevaluation of traditional roles and encourages a move towards a more inclusive and equitable society where the strength of character, rather than gender, defines one's ability to lead and influence."},{"prompt":"Considering Arya’s stoic and snarky attitude, how special could it be if Gendry was one of the few people she speaks with honestly and openly, with no snark at all?","completion":"Arya Stark's evolution from the young, rebellious daughter of Ned Stark to a seasoned warrior with a stoic and snarky attitude is a compelling journey of survival, identity, and vengeance. Arya’s demeanor, shaped by loss and the harsh realities she faces, often masks her vulnerabilities. Within this context, her honest and open interactions with Gendry, devoid of any snark or facade, would be profoundly significant. This dynamic not only highlights the depth of their relationship but also offers a glimpse into Arya’s complex personality and emotional landscape. # The Significance of Vulnerability Arya's willingness to drop her guard around Gendry symbolizes trust and safety. In a world where she constantly has to defend herself physically and emotionally, Gendry becomes a sanctuary, a person with whom she can be her true self without fear of judgment or betrayal. This level of vulnerability with Gendry underlines the fundamental human need for connection and understanding, showcasing a side of Arya that yearns for normalcy amidst chaos. # Highlighting a Unique Bond Their interactions, untainted by Arya's usual defenses, emphasize the unique nature of their bond. It suggests a history and an intimacy developed over time, rooted in shared experiences and mutual respect. For Arya to communicate with Gendry without snark is to acknowledge him not just as a friend but as a confidant. This level of openness is rare for Arya, making her interactions with Gendry special and indicative of the profound impact they have on each other's lives. # Demonstrating Growth and Change Arya speaking to Gendry honestly and openly, without resorting to snark, also highlights her personal growth. It shows that despite the walls she has built around herself, she is capable of emotional growth and change. Arya’s interactions with Gendry serve as a measure of her evolution, suggesting that she has not only survived her ordeals but has also preserved her capacity for genuine connections. # A Contrast to Other Relationships The stark contrast between Arya's interactions with Gendry and her dealings with other characters reinforces the significance of their relationship. While Arya navigates the world around her with a sharp tongue and a sharper blade, her moments with Gendry offer a reprieve from the facade she presents to the world. This contrast deepens the narrative, offering insights into her character and highlighting the importance of Gendry in her life. # Mutual Respect and Empowerment Arya’s honest and snark-free conversations with Gendry also underscore a mutual respect and empowerment central to their relationship. Gendry respects Arya’s wisdom, strength, and independence, while Arya values Gendry’s honesty, resilience, and understanding. Their interaction is a dialogue of equals, where both characters learn from and strengthen each other. This mutual respect and empowerment further cement the special bond they share, setting a foundation for a relationship based on equality and mutual admiration. In conclusion, Arya Stark’s open and honest interactions with Gendry, marked by an absence of snark, are a testament to the emotional depth and complexity of their relationship.

Duress The original definition of duress was a very narrow one. It meant actual or threatened unlawful violence to, or constraint of, the person of the contracting party. According to a group of mid-19th century cases, \\"duress of goods\\" does not affect the validity of a contract, so that a promise to pay money to prevent the unlawful seizure of goods, or to obtain the release of goods which have been unlawfully detained, amounts to a perfectly good contract. But it has also been held in another line of cases, that money actually paid in such circumstances can be recovered back by the payer; and the two lines of cases are in fact incongruous, even if it is possible to reconcile them on technical grounds. Recent cases indicate that the courts are moving away from the view that only duress to the person can invalidate a contract: for example, it has been said that duress could be pleaded where a person was forced to enter into a contract by the threat of having his house burnt down, or a valuable picture slashed. It is possible to go even further and to put cases of so-called \\"economic duress\\", in which a promise is obtained by threatening to do some act which would have highly adverse effects on the promisor, for example by a lender's threat to call in a loan, knowing that the borrower would be ruined if the threat were carried out.

The process can be complex, as it often involves addressing denial, which is a natural initial response to loss or change in abilities. Here are some steps and considerations that healthcare providers, caregivers, and family members might find useful: 1. **Understand the Stages of Grief**: Recognize that denial is part of the grieving process, which can include denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. A person's refusal to accept their handicap could be a manifestation of their coping mechanism at a particular stage. 2. **Provide Emotional Support**: Offer a listening ear and validate their feelings without judgment. It's important for the patient to feel heard and understood rather than pressured into acceptance. 3. **Educate Gently**: Gradually provide information about the handicap, potential adaptations, and coping strategies. Use language that the patient is comfortable with, and avoid overwhelming them with too much information at once. 4. **Encourage Independence Within Limits**: Empower the patient by focusing on what they can do and encouraging independence while being realistic about limitations. This can help build confidence and a sense of control. 5. **Involve Them in Decision Making**: Include the patient in discussions and decisions about their care and adaptations needed for their handicap. This involvement can foster a sense of ownership over their new circumstances. 6. **Facilitate Peer Support**: Connecting the patient with others who have successfully adjusted to similar handicaps can provide a sense of community and hope. Peer support groups can offer practical advice, understanding, and a different perspective. 7. **Consult Mental Health Professionals**: In cases where denial is severe or prolonged, consulting psychologists or psychiatrists may be beneficial. These professionals can provide therapy and strategies to help the patient navigate their emotions and acceptance process. 8. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Work with the patient to set realistic goals that they can achieve. Celebrate these achievements, no matter how small, to build confidence and demonstrate progress. 9. **Respect the Patient’s Pace**: Everyone's journey to acceptance is unique. It's important to respect the patient's pace and not rush the process. Continuous support and understanding are key. 10. **Involve Family and Friends**: Educate and involve the patient’s support system. Their understanding and encouragement can play a significant role in the patient’s journey towards acceptance. In summary, handling a patient's refusal to accept their handicap with empathy, support, and targeted strategies can guide them towards acceptance and adaptation. It's a gradual process that requires patience and understanding from everyone involved."},{"prompt":"dict = {'aaa':123, 'bbb': 234, 'abc':fe} if 'abc' in dict how to check if key exists","completion":"To check if a key exists in a dictionary in Python, you use the \`in\` keyword. Your example demonstrates the correct approach but contains a couple of syntax issues and an error in the definition of the dictionary value for 'abc'. Assuming you meant for 'abc' to have a string or numerical value, here’s a corrected and complete example: \`\`\`python # Correct the dictionary definition dict = {'aaa': 123, 'bbb': 234, 'abc': 345} # Assuming 'abc' should have a numerical value # Check if the key exists if 'abc' in dict: print(f\\"The key 'abc' exists in the dictionary.\\") else: print(f\\"The key 'abc' does not exist in the dictionary.\\") \`\`\` This code checks if the key 'abc' exists in the dictionary and prints a message accordingly. Remember, in Python dictionaries, keys are unique and case-sensitive. This means 'abc', 'Abc', and 'ABC' would be considered different keys. Additionally, ensure your dictionary is correctly formed. For instance, in your original example, \`{'abc':fe}\`, \`fe\` would cause a NameError unless it's defined as a variable before.

This script will print out the full paths of all files within the specified folder. If you have a folder that contains subfolders and you'd like to iterate over those as well (i.e., recursively going through the directory tree), you might prefer using \`os.walk()\` which walks the tree either top-down or bottom-up: \`\`\`python import os # Specify the directory path you want to iterate over folder_path = 'your/directory/path' # os.walk() yields a tuple of 3 values for each folder in the directory tree for root, dirs, files in os.walk(folder_path): for file in files: # Construct full file path full_path = os.path.join(root, file) print(f\\"File: {full_path}\\") \`\`\` This will print out the paths of all files not just in the specified directory, but in all its subdirectories as well.

Read the cookies file. 2. Deserialize the cookies from byte format back to a Python object representing the cookies (the format of the file and the serialization method determine how this step is done). 3. Create a \`requests.Session\` object and update its cookies with the deserialized cookies. Assuming the cookies file is serialized using Python's \`pickle\` module (common for serializing and deserializing Python objects to and from bytes), here is how you might do it: \`\`\`python import requests import pickle # Path to your cookies file serialized in byte format cookies_file_path = 'path_to_your_cookies_file' # Step 1: Read the cookies from the file with open(cookies_file_path, 'rb') as file: # Step 2: Deserialize the cookies cookies = pickle.load(file) # Step 3: Create a requests session and set cookies session = requests.Session() session.cookies.update(cookies) # Now you can use the session to make requests with the loaded cookies response = session.get('http://example.com') print(response.text) \`\`\` A few points to note: - This example assumes that the cookies were serialized using \`pickle\`. If a different method was used, you'd need to adjust the deserialization step accordingly. - Using \`pickle\` can be risky, especially when loading files from untrusted sources, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution. Ensure your cookies file is from a trusted source. - This approach updates a \`requests.Session\`'s cookies, which means subsequent requests made with that session will use those cookies. Adjust the \`cookies_file_path\` variable to point to your specific cookies file. This script should work to load the cookies and make a request using those cookies with the \`requests\` library's session object."},{"prompt":"get date when file was created python","completion":"To get the date when a file was created in Python, you can use the \`os\` module to interact with the operating system and retrieve file metadata. The process differs slightly between UNIX-based systems (like Linux and macOS) and Windows due to differences in how these operating systems handle file creation times. # For Windows On Windows, the file creation time can be directly obtained: \`\`\`python import os from datetime import datetime # Specify the path to your file file_path = 'path_to_your_file' # Get the creation time of the file creation_time = os.path.getctime(file_path) # Convert the creation time to a readable format readable_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(creation_time).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') print(f\\"File was created on: {readable_time}\\") \`\`\` # For UNIX-based Systems (Linux/macOS) UNIX-like systems do not natively store the creation time of files in most filesystems; instead, they store the last time a file's metadata changed (ctime). For these systems, it’s more common to retrieve the \\"modification time\\" since it’s more reliably supported across different file systems. \`\`\`python import os from datetime import datetime # Specify the path to your file file_path = 'path_to_your_file' # Get the modification time of the file modification_time = os.path.getmtime(file_path) # Convert the modification time to a readable format readable_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(modification_time).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') print(f\\"File was last modified on: {readable_time}\\") \`\`\` # Note on Creation Time in UNIX-based Systems As of Python 3.4 and newer, there's a way to attempt to retrieve the actual creation time (birth time) of files on systems where it is available, using \`os.stat()\` and accessing the \`st_birthtime\` attribute. However, its availability varies with the operating system and the filesystem used. Here's how you might do it, keeping in mind that it won't work on all systems: \`\`\`python import os from datetime import datetime file_path = 'path_to_your_file' # Use os.stat() to get file statistics stats = os.stat(file_path) # Attempt to get the creation (birth) time; this may not be available on all systems try: creation_time = stats.st_birthtime readable_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(creation_time).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') print(f\\"File was created on: {readable_time}\\") except AttributeError: print(\\"Creation time not available on this system.\\") \`\`\` Remember to replace \`'path_to_your_file'\` with the actual path to the file whose creation date you want to find."},{"prompt":"can i save class instance to json in python?","completion":"Yes, you can save a class instance to JSON in Python, but it requires a bit of manual intervention because the JSON module does not natively understand Python's class instances. You need to convert your class instance into a Python \`dict\` (or another JSON-serializable object) before you can serialize it to JSON. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it: # 1. Define Your Class with a Method to Convert Instance to \`dict\` Firstly, define your class and include a method (\`to_dict\`, for example) that returns a dictionary representation of the instance: \`\`\`python class MyClass: def __init__(self, name, age): self.name = name self.age = age def to_dict(self): return { 'name': self.name, 'age': self.age, } # Create an instance of MyClass my_instance = MyClass(\\"John Doe\\", 30) \`\`\` # 2. Serialize the \`dict\` to JSON Use the \`json\` module to serialize the dictionary returned by \`to_dict\`: \`\`\`python import json # Convert the instance to dictionary and then to JSON string instance_json = json.dumps(my_instance.to_dict()) print(instance_json) \`\`\` # 3. Optionally, Implement a Generic Serializer If you find yourself needing to serialize various classes, you might want to implement a more generic serializer function. One approach is to use a custom JSON encoder by subclassing \`json.JSONEncoder\`: \`\`\`python class MyEncoder(json.JSONEncoder): def default(self, obj): if hasattr(obj, 'to_dict'): return obj.to_dict() return super().default(obj) instance_json = json.dumps(my_instance, cls=MyEncoder) print(instance_json) \`\`\` # 4. Deserializing JSON Back to a Class Instance When you need to deserialize the JSON string back to a class instance, you should implement that logic explicitly. Here’s an example: \`\`\`python class MyClass: def __init__(self, name, age): self.name = name self.age = age def to_dict(self): return {'name': self.name, 'age': self.age} @classmethod def from_json(cls, json_str): attributes = json.loads(json_str) return cls(**attributes) # Assuming instance_json is your JSON string my_instance_copy = MyClass.from_json(instance_json) print(f\\"Name: {my_instance_copy.name}, Age: {my_instance_copy.age}\\") \`\`\` This approach requires you to convert between dictionaries and class instances explicitly, ensuring that you have complete control over the serialization and deserialization processes. JSON serialization works well for data that can be represented as basic data types in JSON (strings, numbers, arrays, boolean, and objects). Complex Python objects, like file handles or database connections, cannot be serialized this way."},{"prompt":"get name of file os python","completion":"To get the name of a file with the full path removed in Python, you can use the \`os.path.basename()\` function from the \`os\` module. This function takes a path and returns only the final component of that path, essentially the file name. Here's a simple example of how to use \`os.path.basename()\`: \`\`\`python import os # Example full file path full_path = '/path/to/your/file.txt' # Extract the file name file_name = os.path.basename(full_path) print(file_name) \`\`\` Output will be: \`\`\` file.txt \`\`\` In this scenario, regardless of the operating system, \`os.path.basename()\` effectively splits the path and returns only the \`file.txt\` portion. If you have a use case where you're working with paths a lot, especially in a cross-platform context, you might also want to look into the \`pathlib\` module available in Python 3.4 and above. \`pathlib\` makes path manipulation more intuitive and in an object-oriented way. Here's how you can achieve the same with \`pathlib.Path\`: \`\`\`python from pathlib import Path # Example full file path as a Path object path = Path('/path/to/your/file.txt') # Extract the file name file_name = path.name print(file_name) \`\`\` This will also output: \`\`\` file.txt \`\`\` \`pathlib\` is a more modern and versatile alternative to the \`os.path\` module and is recommended if you're working with newer versions of Python."},{"prompt":"find duplicates in list in python","completion":"Finding duplicates in a list in Python can be done in several ways depending on what exactly you want as the result (e.g., a list of duplicates, a count of duplicates, etc.). Here are a few approaches: # 1. Using a \`set\` to Find Duplicate Values This method is useful for simply identifying if there are any duplicates in the list, without necessarily counting occurrences: \`\`\`python def find_duplicates(input_list): seen = set() duplicates = set(x for x in input_list if x in seen or seen.add(x)) return list(duplicates) my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 6, 7] print(find_duplicates(my_list)) \`\`\` # 2. Using \`collections.Counter\` to Count Duplicates If you want not only to identify duplicates but also count how many times each element is duplicated, \`collections.Counter\` can be helpful: \`\`\`python from collections import Counter def find_duplicates_with_counts(input_list): counts = Counter(input_list) return {key: value for key, value in counts.items() if value > 1} my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 6, 7] print(find_duplicates_with_counts(my_list)) \`\`\` This will provide a dictionary with elements as keys and their counts as values, but only for those that are duplicated. # 3. Using a Loop to Keep Track of Duplicates For a more manual approach where you might want more control over how duplicates are identified, here's how you can do it using a loop: \`\`\`python def find_duplicates_manual(input_list): seen = {} duplicates = [] for item in input_list: if item in seen: seen[item] += 1 if seen[item] == 2: # Makes sure to add to duplicates only once duplicates.append(item) else: seen[item] = 1 return duplicates my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 6, 7] print(find_duplicates_manual(my_list)) \`\`\` This method is a bit more verbose but lets you easily adjust criteria for considering something a duplicate or handle items in special ways. # 4. Using List Comprehensions for Conciseness If you're looking for a one-liner and performance is not a major concern (for example, with small lists), you can use a list comprehension combined with the \`count\` method: \`\`\`python my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 6, 7] duplicates = list(set([x for x in my_list if my_list.count(x) > 1])) print(duplicates) \`\`\` This method is concise, but because \`list.count()\` is called for each element, it's not efficient for large lists (having a time complexity of O(n^2)). Each of these methods has its own use-case depending on whether you're just identifying if duplicates exist, counting occurrences, or need more custom handling of duplicates."},{"prompt":"Write a female character named Isabella Grayford, or ‘Bella Gray’, that is a detective with a mysterious past, and slight autism.","completion":"Isabella \\"Bella\\" Grayford stands as a riveting presence in the bustling metropolitan police department. At first glance, she seems to blend in with the gray surroundings of the office, her demeanor calm and her movements precise. However, beneath her average exterior lies an exceptional intellect and a mysterious past that only a few dare to venture into. Growing up in the shadowy outskirts of the city, Bella was always an enigmatic child, often finding solace in the complex patterns of nature and the intricate puzzles of life that others overlooked. Her slight autism presented a unique lens through which she viewed the world, seeing connections and clues invisible to others, making her a brilliant yet unconventional detective. Bella’s journey into law enforcement wasn't driven by a longing for action or a thirst for justice in the conventional sense. It was her keen attention to detail and an uncanny ability to read situations and people in a way that seemed almost otherworldly. Yet, her autism also meant she approached social interactions with a directness and honesty that could be both disarming and off-putting to some. To her colleagues, Bella Gray is somewhat of an enigma; her past is a tapestry woven with threads of loss, resilience, and unspoken secrets. Rumors whisper of a family tragedy that fueled her relentless pursuit of justice, a journey that led her to the heart of the city's darkness, only to emerge as its most unlikely guardian. As \\"Bella Gray,\\" she operates with an unmatched efficiency, her slight autism affording her a unique perspective. Her analytical mind can unravel the most complex of cases, often leading her down paths others might overlook or misinterpret. Yet, this same gift comes with its shadows. Her dedication to her work and her unique way of processing the world around her can create a barrier between herself and others, sometimes making her feel isolated in a sea of faces. Bella's approach to solving crimes is unconventional, to say the least. She relies heavily on pattern recognition, often making connections that span across different cases, sometimes even relying on seemingly irrelevant details that others might disregard as coincidental. Her office, a controlled chaos of case files and notes, is a testament to her methodical nature and unconventional problem-solving techniques. Despite her brilliance, Bella wrestles with the emotional toll of delving into the darkness of human nature. She finds solace in the small things – the predictable rhythms of classical music, the intricate beauty of origami, which she folds with meticulous precision, and brief moments of connection that remind her of the life outside her cases. With each case she solves, Bella Grayford reveals little about herself but impacts the lives of those around her profoundly. An advocate for justice in her unique way, she challenges the stereotypes of what it means to be a detective and what it means to see the world differently. Isabella \\"Bella\\" Grayford is more than her mysterious past or her slight autism; she is a beacon of hope in the fight against the chaos and darkness that lurks in the city's heart. In her pursuit of truth, she not only unravels the mysteries laid before her but also the mysteries within, slowly bridging the gap between her isolated world and the community she serves."},{"prompt":"Rearrange her name into a new one five times.","completion":"1.

The Golden Rule has been articulated in various forms across many cultures and religious traditions throughout history, suggesting a universal recognition of empathy and reciprocal respect as important values in human interactions. Despite its simplicity, applying the Golden Rule can lead to profound considerations about how we interact with others and the ethical decisions we make in everyday life."},{"prompt":"Can you give me a great example","completion":"Certainly, let's consider an example of the Golden Rule in action that highlights its importance in both personal and broader social contexts: **Scenario: Workplace Ethics** Imagine you are a manager at a company. One of your team members, Alex, has been underperforming for a few weeks. You notice the drop in productivity, and it's affecting the team's overall output and morale. **Without the Golden Rule:** You might respond to the situation by immediately reprimanding Alex, possibly in front of the team, or even considering termination without seeking to understand the underlying issues. This approach can create fear, reduce morale, and foster a toxic work environment. **With the Golden Rule:** Before taking any action, you put yourself in Alex's shoes and consider how you would want to be treated if you were facing difficulties that affected your work. With this perspective, you decide to have a private, empathetic conversation with Alex to understand any challenges they might be facing, whether personal or work-related. During the meeting, you discover that Alex has been dealing with some health issues and is feeling overwhelmed by recent changes in their personal life. Remembering the Golden Rule, you collaborate with Alex to find a solution that supports their well-being and helps them return to their usual performance level. This might include temporary adjustments to their workload, flexible working hours, or connecting them with support resources. **Outcome:** By applying the Golden Rule, you've addressed the issue with compassion and understanding, potentially preventing further personal and professional harm to Alex. Moreover, this approach helps in maintaining a positive team environment, as it demonstrates that management cares about the team members' well-being, leading to higher morale and productivity in the long run. This example illustrates how the Golden Rule can guide ethical decision-making in leadership and interpersonal relationships by encouraging empathy, fairness, and compassionate action."},{"prompt":"قم

OpenAI generally implements guidelines that prevent the generation of harmful, unsafe, or inappropriate content, including uncensored profanity. This is in line with maintaining broad accessibility and ensuring that the AI's interactions remain respectful and appropriate for a wide audience. It's crucial to creating a positive user experience and adhering to various international laws and platform standards. It's important to note that policies and regulations around AI and digital interactions evolve. OpenAI, like other organizations, may adjust its guidelines in response to legal, social, and technological changes.
