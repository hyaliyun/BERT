For all ( 1 le j le |A| ), ( (z_i - z_1) ) is an element of ( D(A) ).

We will prove the inequality for ( n )-tuples. 3. **Consider ( n )-tuples** Let ( A ) consist of the elements ( e_i = {a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, ldots, a_{i, n} } ) for all ( 1 le i le a = |A| ). Consider the ( n-1 )-tuples ( e_i' = {a_{i, 2}, a_{i, 3}, ldots, a_{i, n} } ) for all ( 1 le i le a ), and let ( f_1, f_2, ldots, f_t ) be the set of distinct elements ( e_i' ), ordered such that if ( n_j ) is the number of ( e_i' ) so that ( e_i' = f_j ) for each ( 1 le j le t ), then ( n_1 le n_2 le cdots le n_t ). Set ( A_j ), for all ( 1 le j le t ), to be the set of ( e_i ) so that ( e_i' = f_j ).

Now define the following process. Start at ( v_t ), draw an edge to itself, and record the ( n-1 )-tuple ( f(f_t, f_t) = { 0, 0, 0, ldots, 0 } ).

Proceed by induction on ( k + l ) to prove this. If ( k + l = 2 ), this is clear. Suppose it is true for all ( k, l ) so that ( k + l le r - 1 ), and we will show that it holds for ( k, l ) so that ( k + l = r ). Assume that ( x_1 < x_2 < cdots < x_k ) and ( y_1 < y_2 < cdots < y_l ). If ( min{k, l} = 1 ), suppose ( k = 1 ), so the elements ( (y_i - x_1) ), for all ( 1 le i le l ) are pairwise distinct and lie in our set of differences, thereby yielding ( l ) differences, as claimed. Now, suppose ( min{k, l} > 1 ). If ( X' = X - x_k ), then there are at least ( k + l - 2 ) distinct values among differences between elements of ( X' ) and ( Y ) due to the inductive hypothesis. Now, ( x_k - y_1 ge x_k - y_j ge x_i - y_j ) for all ( 1 le i le k ) and ( 1 le j le l ), where equality only occurs when ( i = k ) and ( j = 1 ).

Consider the base case, when ( t = 2 ). If ( n_1 = n_2 ), then [ leftlceil frac{n_1 + n_2 - 1}{2} rightrceil = n_1 ] so [ leftlceil frac{n_1 + n_2 - 1}{2} rightrceil + n_2 = n_1 + n_2 ] as claimed. If ( n_1 > n_2 ), then [ leftlceil frac{n_1 + n_2 - 1}{2} rightrceil + n_2 ge frac{n_1 + n_1 + 1 - 1}{2} + n_2 = n_1 + n_2 ] The base case is thus proven. Now suppose that result holds for ( t = r - 1 ), and we shall prove the result for ( t = r ). If ( n_{r-1} = n_r ), then [ sum_{i=2}^r leftlceil frac{n_i + n_{i-1} - 1}{2} rightrceil + n_r = sum_{i=2}^{r-1} leftlceil frac{n_i + n_{i-1} - 1}{2} rightrceil + n_{r-1} + leftlceil frac{n_{r-1} + n_r}{2} rightrceil ] [ ge sum_{i=1}^{r-1} n_i + n_r = sum_{i=1}^r n_i ] If ( n_r > n_{r-1} ), then [ sum_{i=2}^r leftlceil frac{n_i + n_{i-1} - 1}{2} rightrceil + n_r = sum_{i=2}^{r-1} leftlceil frac{n_i + n_{i-1} - 1}{2} rightrceil + n_r + leftlceil frac{n_{r-1} + n_r - 1}{2} rightrceil ] [ ge sum_{i=2}^{r-1} leftlceil frac{n_i + n_{i-1} - 1}{2} rightrceil + frac{n_{r-1} + n_{r-1} + 1 -1}{2} + n_r ge sum_{i=1}^r n_i ] by the inductive hypothesis. Hence, the lemma is proven. 8. **Conclusion** By Lemma 1, there are at least ( leftlceil frac{n_x + n_y - 1}{2} rightrceil ) differences between elements of ( A_x ) and ( A_y ). Moreover, by the base case of the original problem, there are at least ( n_t ) differences between elements of ( A_t ). Let ( n(A_x, A_y) ) be the number of distinct ( n )-tuples in the set of ( f(s, t) ), where ( s ) ranges over all elements of ( A_x ) and ( t ) ranges over all elements of ( A_y ). Summing this over all sets ( (x, y) ) so that ( v_x ) and ( v_y ) are connected gives that [ |D(A)| ge sum_{v_i, v_j text{ connected}} n(A_i, A_j) + n_t ge sum_{v_i, v_j text{ connected}} leftlceil frac{n_i + n_j - 1}{2} rightrceil + n_t ] because differences between ( A_i ) and ( A_j ) will form a \\"new difference\\" in the last ( n - 1 ) elements of the ( n )-tuple if ( v_i ) and ( v_j ) are connected. By the inductive hypothesis, after completing the ( j )th set, there are at least ( j ) edges for all ( 1 le j le n ). Hence (by induction, for instance), [ sum_{v_i, v_j text{ connected}} leftlceil frac{n_i + n_j - 1}{2} rightrceil ge sum_{i=2}^t leftlceil frac{n_i + n_{i-1} - 1}{2} rightrceil + n_t ] which is greater than or equal to ( sum_{i=1}^t n_i = a = |A| ) by Lemma 2. Hence, ( |D(A)| ge |A| ), as desired.

Given f(x) = frac{1}{{x}^{2}+1}-{2}^{|x|}, we check for evenness: - For any real number x, we have f(-x) = frac{1}{{(-x)}^{2}+1}-{2}^{|-x|} = frac{1}{{x}^{2}+1}-{2}^{|x|} = f(x). This establishes that f(x) is an even function. 2. **Analyze the Function's Behavior** For any two numbers 0 leqslant x_{1} < x_{2}, we can write the difference f(x_1) - f(x_2) as: - f(x_{1}) - f(x_{2}) = left(frac{1}{{x_{1}}^{2}+1} - {2}^{x_{1}}right) - left(frac{1}{{x_{2}}^{2}+1} - {2}^{x_{2}}right) - Simplifying, we get: f(x_{1}) - f(x_{2}) = frac{{x_{2}} + {x_{1}}}{{x_{1}}^{2}+1)({x_{2}}^{2}+1)}({x_{2}} - {x_{1}}) + {2}^{x_{2}} - {2}^{x_{1}}.

In a parallelogram, the diagonals are equal if it is a rectangle or an equilateral quadrilateral (rhombus). Additionally, in a square (which is both a rectangle and a rhombus), every pair of diagonals is equal. - For n = 5, in a regular pentagon, all sides and angles are equal, all diagonals are also equal. 2. **Step 2:** Test the scenario further with n = 6 to understand if all diagonals being equal leads to contradictions. - Suppose n = 6, and let A, B, C, D, E, F be the vertices of the polygon such that AD = AE = AF. - As all diagonals are equal, AC = BD = CE = DF... are equal. - This implies each quadrilateral formed by connecting three consecutive vertices and one non-adjacent vertex forms an isosceles trapezoid. 3. **Step 3:** Use geometric properties to identify inconsistencies. - From the properties of trapezoids and non-adjacency of vertices in higher n sided polygons, it leads to the conclusion triangle CEF would contradict certain geometric properties (e.g., CF neq CE violating the equality assumption). 4. **Conclusion:** - For a general polygon (n >= 6 or more vertices): consistency would not hold. - Therefore, achievable conditions are only valid for a quadrilateral (rectangle, rhombus or square) and for a pentagon (regular with all sides and angles equal).

According to the information given: - 30% of the class are women who are science majors. - 60% of the class are non-science majors (both men and women). - 40% of the class are men (both science and non-science majors). Since 60% of the class are non-science majors, the remaining 40% must be science majors (both men and women).

Given the equilateral triangle ABC with the side length equal to 2: [ AB = BC = AC = 2 ] 5.

The sum of the radii ( r_a + r_b + r_c ) is maximized when the term: [ AM + AP + BN + BK + CL + CQ ] is maximized, which implies minimizing: [ MN + KL + PQ ] 7. Minimizing ( MN + KL + PQ ) is equivalent to minimizing the perimeter of the triangle ( A_1B_1C_1 ) formed by points ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ) on the sides of triangle ( ABC ). 8. It is known (see task reference 55563) that the minimum perimeter of all triangles inscribed in an acute triangle is achieved by the orthic triangle (the triangle formed by connecting the feet of the altitudes). 9.

Suppose the plane containing the triangle ( ABC ) intersects the projection plane along the line ( m ). 4. **Parallel Lines**: In the projection plane, draw lines through vertices ( A, B, ) and ( C ) that are parallel to the line ( m ). Consider the line ( AD ), parallel to ( m ), dividing triangle ( ABC ) into two smaller triangles, ( ABD ) and ( ACD ), with ( AD parallel m ). 5. **Projection of Line Segment**: The line segment ( AD ) projects orthogonally to ( A'D' ), maintaining the length ( AD ). The height (BH) of triangle ( ABD ) from vertex B to line ( AD ) is perpendicular to ( m ). 6. **Angle Consideration**: The angle between the height ( BH ) and its projection ( B'H' ) equals the angle ( varphi ) between the planes of triangles ( ABC ) and (A'B'C' ). 7. **Area Calculation**: The area of the project triangle ( A'B'D' ) can be calculated as: [ S_{triangle A'B'D'} = frac{1}{2} A'D' cdot B'H' = frac{1}{2} AD cdot BH cdot cos varphi = S_{triangle ABD} cdot cos varphi ] 8. **Analogous Calculation**: Similarly, the area of the other triangle after projection: [ S_{triangle A'C'D'} = S_{triangle ACD} cdot cos varphi ] 9. **Sum of Areas**: Summing the areas of the projected triangles: [ S_{triangle A'B'C'} = S_{triangle A'B'D'} + S_{triangle A'C'D'} = (S_{triangle ABD} + S_{triangle ACD}) cdot cos varphi ] Since ( S_{triangle ABC} = S_{triangle ABD} + S_{triangle ACD} ), it follows that: [ S_{triangle A'B'C'} = S_{triangle ABC} cdot cos varphi ] 10. **Conclusion for Triangle**: This completes the proof for a triangle, showing that the area of the orthogonal projection of a triangle is indeed the area of the triangle multiplied by the cosine of the angle between the planes. 11. **Extension to Polygon**: To extend this result to any polygon, decompose the polygon into a finite number of triangles. Since each triangle projection maintains the area relation proved above, the entire polygon's projection will obey the same multiplicative area-cosine relation. 12. **Final Conclusion**: Thus, the orthogonal projection area of any planar polygon equals the polygon's area multiplied by the cosine of the angle between the polygon's plane and the projection plane.

Since (d) divides both (x-y) and (2x+2y+1), it must also divide any linear combination of these terms. Specifically: [ d mid (2x+2y+1) - 2(x-y) = 4y + 1 ] 6. Therefore, (d mid 4y + 1). Since (d) also divides (y), it must divide (4y + 1 - 4y = 1). Hence, (d = 1). 7. This implies that (x-y) and (2x+2y+1) are coprime. Since their product is a perfect square, each of them must be a perfect square individually. 8. Let: [ x-y = a^2 quad text{and} quad 2x+2y+1 = b^2 ] for some integers (a) and (b). 9. Similarly, consider the equation: [ (x-y)(3x+3y+1) = x^2 ] 10.

We are to find the volume of the cone. **Step-by-step Solution:** 1. **Understand the relationship between the cone and the pyramid:** The apex of the cone and the apex of the pyramid are the same, and they have the same height (m). Therefore, the ratio of their volumes is equal to the ratio of the areas of their bases. 2. **Calculate the radius of the inscribed circle in the triangle base of the pyramid:** The inscribed circle radius (inradius) varrho for an isosceles triangle can be expressed as: [ varrho = frac{a}{2} tan frac{alpha}{2} ] where (a) is the base length of the isosceles triangle and alpha is the angle at the base of the triangle. 3. **Calculate the height of the triangular base:** The height (m_a) of the isosceles triangle from the apex to the base is given by: [ m_a = left(frac{a}{2}right) tan alpha ] 4. **Calculate the area of the triangular base:** The area (A) of the isosceles triangle is: [ A = frac{1}{2} a m_a = frac{1}{2} a left(frac{a}{2} tan alpharight) = frac{a^2 tan alpha}{4} ] 5. **Establish the ratio of volumes:** The base area of the cone is (pi varrho^2), so the ratio of the volumes can be expressed as: [ frac{V_k}{V} = frac{pi varrho^2}{A} = pi left( frac{a}{2} tan frac{alpha}{2} right)^2 / left( frac{a^2 tan alpha}{4} right) ] 6. **Simplify the ratio:** Simplifying the above expression, we get: [ frac{V_k}{V} = frac{pi left( frac{a tan frac{alpha}{2}}{2} right)^2}{frac{a^2 tan alpha}{4}} = pi frac{a^2 tan^2 frac{alpha}{2}}{4} cdot 4 frac{1}{a^2 tan alpha} = pi tan^2 frac{alpha}{2} cot alpha ] 7. **Calculate the volume of the cone (V_k):** Using the simplified ratio, we have: [ V_k = V cdot pi tan^2 frac{alpha}{2} cot alpha ] Substituting in the given values: [ V_k = 671.6 text{ m}^3 cdot pi tan^2 29^circ cot 58^circ ] 8. **Numerical computation:** - First, calculate tan 29^circ and cot 58^circ: [ tan 29^circ approx 0.5543 quad text{and} quad cot 58^circ = frac{1}{tan 58^circ} approx 0.6018 ] - Then compute tan^2 29^circ: [ tan^2 29^circ approx (0.5543)^2 approx 0.3073 ] - Compute the volume: [ V_k approx 671.6 cdot pi cdot 0.3073 cdot 0.6018 ] - Using pi approx 3.1416: [ V_k approx 671.6 cdot 3.1416 cdot 0.3073 cdot 0.6018 approx 671.6 cdot 0.5828 approx 405.1 text{ m}^3 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{405.1 text{ m}^3} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the plane vectors overrightarrow{a} = (2m 1, 2) and overrightarrow{b} = (2, 3m 2), and | overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b} | = | overrightarrow{a} overrightarrow{b} |.

Notice that (1001e + 110f) can be factored as: [ 1001e + 110f = 11(91e + 10f) ] This shows that (overline{effe} = 1001e + 110f) is divisible by 11 because (11) is a factor of (1001). 3.

The directrix of a parabola x^{2} = 2py is given by y = -frac{p}{2}, so in this case, the directrix is y = -frac{1}{4}. This means option A is incorrect because it states the directrix is y = -1. For the line passing through points A(1,1) and B(0,-1), the slope k_{AB} is calculated as: [k_{AB} = frac{1 - (-1)}{1 - 0} = 2.] Thus, the equation of line AB is y = 2x - 1.

First, we need to find the volume of water displaced by the boat when the man gets on it. Since the boat sinks by 1.8 cm, we can convert this to meters (since the breadth is given in meters) to keep the units consistent: 1.8 cm = 0.018 m The volume of water displaced (V) is equal to the surface area of the submerged part of the boat (which is the length (L) times the breadth (B)) multiplied by the depth (D) the boat sinks: V = L * B * D We know the breadth (B) is 2 m and the depth (D) is 0.018 m. We need to find the length (L). The weight of the man (W) is the mass (m) times the acceleration due to gravity (g), which is approximately 9.8 m/s²: W = m * g W = 108 kg * 9.8 m/s² W = 1058.4 N (newtons) This weight is also the weight of the water displaced.

The basic cosine function cos{x} has a period of 2pi. Since the coefficient of x in cos{x} is 1, which does not change the period, the period of 4cos{x} - 1 is also 2pi. Therefore, [ boxed{ text{the smallest positive period of } f(x) text{ is } T = 2pi }. ] 2. To find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) in the interval (0, frac{pi}{2}), we can use the fact that f(x) = 4cos{x} - 1 is a continuous and differentiable function within this interval, we can look for critical points where the derivative is zero, as well as the interval boundaries. The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = -4sin{x}. Setting the derivative equal to zero gives -4sin{x} = 0, which implies sin{x} = 0. Within (0, frac{pi}{2}), the sine function does not equal zero, so there are no critical points in this interval that would yield local maxima or minima. We must then check the interval boundaries: At x = 0, f(x) = 4cos{0} - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3. At x = frac{pi}{2}, f(x) = 4cos{frac{pi}{2}} - 1 = 4 times 0 - 1 = -1.

A move consists of erasing two distinct letters from the board and replacing them with the third letter in ( S ). What is the probability that Alice can perform a sequence of moves which results in one letter remaining on the blackboard?","completion":"1. Let n_{a}, n_{b}, and n_{c} be the number of a's, b's, and c's on the board, respectively. We start by observing that each move will change the parity of all three of n_{a}, n_{b}, and n_{c}. 2. The goal is to determine if Alice can perform a sequence of moves which results in a single letter remaining on the blackboard. This final configuration must have the counts (1,0,0) or a permutation of this. 3. Notice that if initially n_{a}, n_{b}, and n_{c} all have the same parity, they will always have the same parity after each move. Therefore, if n_{a}, n_{b}, and n_{c} start with the same parity, Alice cannot produce the sequence (1,0,0) as it has differing parities. 4. Alice also cannot achieve the goal if all 1001 letters start off the same, because no moves can be made in this scenario to transform the board. 5. Next, we claim that in all other cases, Alice can make a sequence of moves that leaves one letter on the board. This claim can be proven via induction. 6. **Base Case**: When the total number of letters n_{a}+n_{b}+n_{c} leq 2. The possible tuples are (1,0,0), (1,1,0), and their permutations. It is easy to verify that they all meet the condition. 7. **Induction Step**: Assume Alice can always reduce the number of letters to one if n_{a} + n_{b} + n_{c} geq 3. Without loss of generality, assume n_{a} geq n_{b} geq n_{c}. 8. If n_{b} geq 1 and n_{a} geq 2 (otherwise, the initial tuple would be (1,1,1) with all same parity which we already handled). Alice can then replace two letters, say a and b, by the third letter c. 9. This reduces the total sum, and by the induction hypothesis, she can further reduce the number of letters until only one letter remains. 10. Now, compute the probability that n_{a}, n_{b}, and n_{c} start with the same parity. Suppose we have m letters chosen uniformly and independently from S. Define x_m to be the probability that n_{a}, n_{b}, and n_{c} all have the same parity after m letters. 11. We have the recurrence relation: [ x_{m+1} = frac{1}{3}(1 - x_m) ] This recurrence comes from recognizing that the addition of the (m+1)-th letter will make the counts n_{a}, n_{b}, and n_{c} have the same parity if originally they did not, and only one-third of the time. 12. Setting x_0 = 1, the probability simplifies to: [ x_m = frac{1}{4}(1 + 3 cdot (-3)^{-m}) ] 13. Plugging in m = 1001, the probability that n_{a}, n_{b}, and n_{c} all have the same parity is x_{1001}. 14. We also need to calculate the probability that all letters are initially the same: [ (aa...a, bb...b, cc...c) ] which happens with probability: [ 3^{-(1001-1)} = 3^{-1000} ] 15.

Solution: Given that z_{n+4} = (1+i)^4 z_n = -4 z_n, We have x_{n+4} = -4 x_n, y_{n+4} = -4 y_n, So, x_{n+4} y_{n+4} = 16 x_n y_n. Also, x_1 y_1 = 12, x_2 y_2 = -7, x_3 y_3 = -48, x_4 y_4 = 28. Hence, x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + x_3 y_3 + dots + x_{100} y_{100} = (x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + x_3 y_3 + x_4 y_4) + (x_5 y_5 + x_6 y_6 + x_7 y_7 + x_8 y_8) + dots + (x_{97} y_{97} + x_{98} y_{98} + x_{99} y_{99} + x_{100} y_{100}) = (12 - 7 - 48 + 28) cdot frac{1 - 16^{25}}{1 - 16} = 1 - 2^{100}.

Prove that the product of these numbers cannot end in 1988.","completion":"To prove that the product of the areas of the four triangles formed by the diagonals of a convex quadrilateral cannot end in 1988, we will show that this product is a perfect square and then make use of properties of number endings in perfect squares. 1. Understanding the Context and Given Information: We are given a convex quadrilateral, which is divided into four triangles by its diagonals intersecting at a point. The areas of these four triangles are denoted by S_{ADP}, S_{ABP}, S_{CDP}, and S_{BCP}, respectively. Each of these areas is an integer. 2. Utilizing the Proportional Relationships of the Areas: From the problem's constraints, we know that the diagonals intersect at a point P. This intersection leads to proportional relationships between the areas of the triangles: [ frac{S_{ADP}}{S_{ABP}} = frac{DP}{BP} quad text{and} quad frac{S_{CDP}}{S_{BCP}} = frac{DP}{BP} ] Thus, we have: [ S_{ADP} cdot S_{BCP} = S_{ABP} cdot S_{CDP} ] 3. Formulating the Product Relationship: From the above proportional relationship: [ S_{ADP} cdot S_{BCP} = S_{ABP} cdot S_{CDP} ] Multiplying both sides by S_{ABP} cdot S_{BCP}, we get: [ S_{ADP} cdot S_{BCP} cdot S_{ABP} cdot S_{CDP} = (S_{ADP} cdot S_{BCP})^2 ] This shows that the product of the areas of the four triangles is a perfect square: [ (S_{ADP} cdot S_{BCP} cdot S_{ABP} cdot S_{CDP}) = (S_{ADP} cdot S_{BCP})^2 ] 4. Considering the Properties of Perfect Squares: One important property of perfect squares is that they cannot end with certain digits. Specifically, a number ending in 1988 cannot be a perfect square. This is because a perfect square can only end with specific digits (00, 01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81). 5. Conclusion: Thus, since the product of the areas of these four triangles is a perfect square, it cannot end in 1988. Hence, we have proven that the product of these integer areas cannot end in 1988.

The cost of the taxfree items was 12.72. What was the total amount the customer paid?","completion":"To find the total amount the customer paid, we need to calculate the cost of the taxable items and then add the cost of the tax-free items and the sales tax. First, let's find the cost of the taxable items before tax. We know that the sales tax was 1.28 and the tax rate was 8% (or 0.08 as a decimal). To find the pre-tax cost of the taxable items, we use the formula: Sales Tax = Pre-tax Cost of Taxable Items × Tax Rate Rearranging the formula to solve for the pre-tax cost of the taxable items, we get: Pre-tax Cost of Taxable Items = Sales Tax / Tax Rate Plugging in the values we have: Pre-tax Cost of Taxable Items = 1.28 / 0.08 Pre-tax Cost of Taxable Items = 16.00 Now we have the pre-tax cost of the taxable items. To find the total amount the customer paid, we add the pre-tax cost of the taxable items, the sales tax, and the cost of the tax-free items: Total Amount Paid = Pre-tax Cost of Taxable Items + Sales Tax + Cost of Tax-Free Items Total Amount Paid = 16.00 + 1.28 + 12.72 Total Amount Paid = 30.00 So, the total amount the customer paid was boxed{30.00} ."},{"prompt":"An 800 m long train takes 47.99616030717543 seconds to cross a man walking with a certain speed in the direction of the moving train if the speed of the train is 63 km/hr.

Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) For the train: Speed in m/s = 63 * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 63 * 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 63000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 17.5 m/s Now, let's calculate the relative speed between the train and the man. Since the man is walking in the direction of the train, we subtract the man's speed from the train's speed to get the relative speed. Let's denote the speed of the man as Vm (in m/s). The relative speed (Vr) is then: Vr = Vt - Vm where Vt is the speed of the train. The time it takes for the train to pass the man is given as 47.99616030717543 seconds. During this time, the train covers its own length plus any distance the man has walked. However, since we are considering the relative speed, we only need to consider the length of the train to find the relative speed. So, the distance covered relative to the man is the length of the train, which is 800 m. Using the formula for speed (speed = distance / time), we can express the relative speed as: Vr = Distance / Time Vr = 800 m / 47.99616030717543 s Vr ≈ 16.668 m/s (rounded to three decimal places) Now we can solve for the man's speed (Vm): Vr = Vt - Vm 16.668 = 17.5 - Vm Vm = 17.5 - 16.668 Vm ≈ 0.832 m/s (rounded to three decimal places) So, the speed of the man walking is approximately boxed{0.832} m/s."},{"prompt":"A piece of cardboard of uniform density in the shape of an equilateral triangle with side length 4 inches weighs 16 ounces.

The fundamental piece of information states that the alarm clock initially functioned correctly but then malfunctioned, causing its hands to move backward instead of forward with the same speed. 3. Let ( t ) be the time at which the alarm clock broke. This means that from ( t ) until 7:00 AM, the hands went backward rather than forward. 4. The problem states that despite malfunctioning, the alarm clock still rang exactly at 7:00 AM. This implies that the total elapsed time for the clock hands, moving forward initially and then backward, restored the clock to 7:00 AM. 5. To formalize this, we can reason as follows: - From 10:00 PM to ( t ), the hands moved forward correctly. - From ( t ) to 7:00 AM, the hands moved backward. 6. We need to find ( t ) such that the net movement of the hands replicates the correct time elapsed from 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM.

The total number of intersections (point-line pairs each line) should then be: [ 7 times 3 = 21 ] Therefore, the given configuration must inherently satisfy the 21 point-line intersections. 6. **Contradiction:** However, we should verify whether arranging 7 points and 7 lines where every point is shared by exactly 3 lines and every line has 3 points is consistent with the fundamental properties of points and lines in projective geometry. In projective geometry, if there are (n) points and (n) lines, and every point is incident to (k) lines while every line is incident to (k) points, a necessary condition must hold: [ k(k - 1) = (n-1) ] Plugging in (k = 3) and (n = 7): [ 3(3-1) ne 7-1 ] [ 6 ne 6 ] In this case, it shows the basic conditions of a combinatorial design are violated. 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, it is impossible to arrange 7 points and 7 lines on the plane such that each point lies on exactly 3 lines and each line passes through exactly 3 points.

Represent the three-digit positive integer N as xy3, where x and y are the tens and hundreds digits, respectively. This notation helps us focus on the condition that the ones digit is fixed at 3. 2. For N to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. This means that x + y + 3 must be divisible by 3. However, since we are concerned with the divisibility of N itself and we know the ones digit is 3, we simplify our condition to focusing on the divisibility of the number formed by the digits x and y. 3. Consider the set of all two-digit numbers (from 10 to 99, inclusive). The rule for divisibility by 3 applies to the sum of the digits of these numbers as well. Therefore, if a two-digit number is divisible by 3, its digit sum is also divisible by 3. 4. There are 90 two-digit numbers in total. Since the divisibility rule for 3 is uniform across all numbers, frac{1}{3} of these two-digit numbers are divisible by 3. This is because the digits 1 through 9 (ignoring 0 for the moment since it does not affect divisibility by 3) are evenly distributed in terms of their contribution to a number's divisibility by 3. 5.

He gave the first one 100 blank cards and instructed him to write a positive number on each (the numbers do not have to be different), without showing them to the second wise man. Then, the first wise man can communicate several distinct numbers to the second wise man, each of which is either written on one of the cards or is a sum of the numbers on some cards (without specifying exactly how each number is derived). The second wise man must determine which 100 numbers are written on the cards. If he cannot do this, both will be executed; otherwise, a number of hairs will be plucked from each of their beards equal to the amount of numbers the first wise man communicated. How can the wise men, without colluding, stay alive and lose the minimum number of hairs?","completion":"1. To prove that the sages can limit their loss to 101 hairs each, assume the following strategy: - Sage 1 writes the numbers (1, 2, 4, ldots, 2^{99}) on the 100 cards. - Sage 1 then communicates these numbers along with their sum to Sage 2. 2. Now, let's analyze the situation from the perspective of Sage 2: - Given the number (1), Sage 2 will understand that there is a card with the number (1). - Hearing the next number (2^{k}), Sage 2 deduces that there is another card with the number (2^{k}). This is because the sum of the evaluated cards so far does not exceed (2^{k}). 3. The communicated numbers form a sequence of powers of 2, which cumulatively wouldn't exceed the next power: [ 1 + 2 + 4 + cdots + 2^{k-1} < 2^k ] 4. When Sage 2 hears the total sum (2^{100}-1), they would recognize this as the sum of the entire sequence of powers of 2 up to (2^{99}): [ 1 + 2 + 4 + cdots + 2^{99} = 2^{100} - 1 ] 5. Therefore, Sage 2 can correctly identify all the numbers on the cards without any errors. The number of hairs lost in this process would be: [ 100 text{ (individual numbers of the cards)} + 1 text{ (total sum)} = 101 ] 6. Next, we need to prove that 100 hairs are insufficient. Assume Sage 2 is communicated exactly 100 different numbers and consider two specific numbers (a) and (b) with (a < b): - If all the communicated numbers can be written directly on the cards without any conflicts, then no sum-based misinterpretations occur. - However, without exceeding 100 communications and given the requirement to cover both individual values and possible sums, it becomes challenging to uniquely determine larger sets without ambiguity. 7. Consequently, this strategy demonstrates that it's necessary for Sage 1 to communicate both the individual values and their overall sum to ensure accuracy. As such, 100 communications alone do not suffice. # Conclusion: Therefore, the sages will lose a minimum of 101 hairs each to successfully solve the problem.

Half of them represent farms (F = {F_1, F_2, ldots, F_n}) and the other half represent water sources (W = {W_1, W_2, ldots, W_n}). We need to connect each farm to a unique water source using straight line segments such that none of these segments intersect. 2. **Initial Setup:** We initially assume an arbitrary pairing in which each farm (F_i) is connected to a unique water source (W_j) by a straight line segment, where (1 leq i, j leq n). 3. **Identifying Intersections:** Suppose there is a situation where two line segments (F_iW_m) and (F_kW_j) intersect. This means the segments (F_iW_m) and (F_kW_j) cross each other. 4. **Reassigning Connections:** In this situation, we can reassign the connections to (F_kW_m) and (F_iW_j). Since (F_i, F_k, W_j, W_m) are distinct and no three points are collinear, this reassignment will reduce the total length of the segments. 5. **Calculating the Length Reduction:** The total length before reassignment is (F_iW_m + F_kW_j). After reassignment, the new total length is (F_kW_m + F_iW_j). [ F_iW_m + F_kW_j > F_iW_j + F_kW_m ] This inequality holds because the original segments intersect, indicating that their endpoints are diagonally opposite with respect to the intersections, and swapping reduces the segment lengths. 6. **Iterating the Process:** We continue this reassignment process for any intersecting segments. Each reassignment strictly reduces the total length of all segments. 7. **Ensuring Finite Steps:** Since there are (n!) possible unique pairings of farms to water sources and with each step reducing the total length, we guarantee that this process must eventually terminate as the total length cannot decrease indefinitely. 8. **Conclusion:** When the process terminates, we have a configuration in which no two line segments intersect. Therefore, a distribution exists where all the paths between the farms and water reservoirs do not intersect, fulfilling the problem's requirement.

Bishops move diagonally on the board, which means that they can only attack pieces positioned along the same diagonal. 1. We need to determine the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on this chessboard such that no two bishops threaten each other. 2. Notice that if a bishop is placed on any square of a certain color (say, white), it cannot threaten any other bishop placed on another square of the same color. Thus, we can separate the board into two independent sets: white squares and black squares. Each set forms an 8 times 8 grid where no bishops threaten each other within the set. 3. First, count the number of white and black squares on the chessboard. In an 8 times 8 chessboard, there are 32 white squares and 32 black squares because the pattern alternates. 4. Determine the number of ways to place the maximum number of bishops on white squares only: - Since the bishops on white squares do not interfere with those on black squares, we analyze the white squares independently. Let k be the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the white squares without threatening each other. Since each bishop restricts an entire diagonal and there are 32 white squares, the maximum number k is 8 (since there are 8 white diagonals). 5. The number of different arrangements of 8 bishops on 32 white squares is: [ binom{32}{8} ] 6. Similarly, using the board's symmetry, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on black squares is also 8, resulting in the same number of different arrangements: [ binom{32}{8} ] 7. Considering both sets, the total number of ways to place all bishops is the product of the number of ways to place them on the white squares and black squares: [ n cdot n = n^2 ] for n = binom{32}{8} different ways. # Conclusion: The total number of such arrangements is a perfect square given by ( n^2 ).

This hyperbola opens to the left and right, and its asymptotes are y = pm x. 2. **Intersection of a Line with a Hyperbola**: A line can intersect a hyperbola at most twice because it is a second-degree curve. If a line intersects the hyperbola, it can do so at either zero, one (if tangent, but tangency is excluded in this problem), or two points. 3. **Analyzing the Lines**: Since neither line is tangent to the hyperbola, each line can intersect the hyperbola at either zero or two points. 4. **Case Analysis**: - **Case 1**: Both lines do not intersect the hyperbola at all.

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a positive integer n = A ldots Z which is a 7-flip. This means when the digits of n are reversed, the number Z ldots A is obtained by multiplying n by 7. 2. Mathematically, this can be written as: [ n times 7 = Z ldots A ] 3. To ensure no carry-over in the multiplication of the last digit, the first digit A of the number must be 1. Consider A ldots Z is of the form 1BCD ldots Z: [ 1BCD ldots Z times 7 = Z ldots DCB1 ] 4. Now we will focus on the units digit of the product. For there to be no carryover and the product of 7 and the last digit to still be a single digit, A must be such that Z times 7 ends in 1. 5. The possible values of Z that satisfy 7Z equiv 1 pmod{10} need to be evaluated. We solve: [ 7Z equiv 1 pmod{10} ] 6.

From the above calculations, the suitable value of Z that satisfies the units digit requirement (7Z equiv 1 pmod{10}) is: [ Z = 3 ] 8. Substituting Z = 3 gives us the units digit of n is 3: [ n = 1BCD ldots 3 ] 9. Since Z is greater than or equal to 7 to avoid carry-over effects, setting Z = 3 contradicts the condition as the units digit of 3 times 7 resulting in 1 does not match any 7-flip property because the rest of the digits can't satisfy the reversal. 10.

Therefore, the angles subtended by the cyclic points reflect this property. For the triangle ABC with I as its incentre and A E F as an incircle tangent, the circumcircle of AEF intersects omega again at point P. Here, omega is the circumcircle of ABC, so A P B C is also cyclic. 2. **Angle Manipulations:** We start by utilizing the angles derived from these cyclic quadrilaterals: [ angle B D E = angle C D F ] Since A E F is cyclic, we have that angle AFE = angle ACB. Combining these facts, we write: [ angle AFD - angle FCD = (180^circ - angle EPA) - (180^circ - angle BPA) ] This simplifies to: [ angle BPA - angle EPA = angle BPE ] Thus, DBEP is cyclic. 3. **Cyclic Chasing:** Knowing DBEP is cyclic, we continue by noting: [ angle IDP = angle EDP = angle EBP ] Also, since APBN is cyclic: [ angle I N P = angle ABP = angle ANP ] 4. **Perpendicularity and Diameter Considerations:** This indicates that PDNI is cyclic as well, with: [ angle DPN = angle DIN = 90^circ ] Let’s denote R as the second intersection of DP and omega.

For 6 type A helmets and 8 type B helmets, the cost is 700: 6x + 8y = 700.

For n=1, we find a_1 from the equation 1 + frac{1}{2}a_1 = 1^2 + frac{1}{2}a_1, giving us a_1 = 2. For n=2, we calculate a_2 using a_1 + a_2 = 2^2 + frac{1}{2}a_2, which simplifies to a_2 = 4. For n=3, we find a_3 from the equation a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 3^2 + frac{1}{2}a_3, leading to a_3 = 6. Based on these calculations, we conjecture that the general term of the sequence is a_n = 2n. To prove this conjecture by mathematical induction: a. When n=1, we already confirmed the conjecture holds. b. Assume it holds for n=k (where k ge 1 and k in N^*), i.e., a_k = 2k. c. For n=k+1, we have S_{k+1} = (k+1)^2 + frac{1}{2}a_{k+1} and S_k = k^2 + frac{1}{2}a_k. Subtracting these, we get a_{k+1} = 2k+2 + frac{1}{2}a_{k+1} - frac{1}{2}a_k.

Since there are four sets in a cycle, b_{100} is the sum of the numbers in the fourth set of the 25th cycle. The first number in the fourth set of each cycle follows an arithmetic sequence with a difference of 20. Similarly, the second, third, and fourth numbers in these sets also form arithmetic sequences, each with a difference of 20. Consequently, the sum of the numbers in the fourth set of each group forms an arithmetic sequence with a difference of 4 times 20 = 80. The sum of the first fourth set is 68, so we compute b_{100} = 68 + 24 times 80 = 1988. With b_5 = 22, the total is b_5 + b_{100} = 22 + 1988 = boxed{2010}.

We need to prove that there are infinitely many natural numbers n such that f(n) mid n. 3. First, observe that sigma(n) = sum_{d mid n} d. If n is odd, then all divisors of n are odd, and thus sigma(n) is odd. If n is even, the even divisors do not affect the parity of sigma(n). 4. Note that perfect squares have an odd number of divisors. Therefore, sigma(x^2) is odd for any x. 5. Consider n = 2x^2. The divisors of 2x^2 include 1, 2, x, 2x, x^2, 2x^2. Since x^2 is a perfect square, sigma(x^2) is odd. Also, sigma(2x^2) is odd because the sum of the divisors of 2x^2 includes an odd number of terms. 6.

Since 60% of the turtles are female, the remaining 40% are male. 40% of 100 turtles = 0.40 * 100 = 40 male turtles. Now, we need to find out how many turtles with stripes are male. We know that 60% of the striped turtles are adults, but we don't know the total number of striped turtles. However, we do know that 4 of the striped turtles are babies. Let's assume the total number of striped turtles is S. Then, 60% of S are adults, and 4 are babies. This means that 40% of S are babies (since 100% - 60% = 40%). So, 40% of S = 4 (because the babies are the 40% of striped turtles). 0.40 * S = 4 S = 4 / 0.40 S = 10 striped turtles in total. Now, we need to find out how many of these striped turtles are male. Since we don't have specific information about the gender distribution of the striped turtles, we can assume that the gender ratio among striped turtles is the same as the overall population. So, if 40% of the total turtles are male, then 40% of the striped turtles should also be male. 40% of 10 striped turtles = 0.40 * 10 = 4 male turtles with stripes. Now we have all the information we need to find the ratio of male turtles with stripes to the total number of male turtles: Number of male turtles with stripes: 4 Total number of male turtles: 40 The ratio is 4:40, which can be simplified by dividing both numbers by 4: 4/4 : 40/4 = 1:10 So, the ratio of male turtles with stripes to the total number of male turtles is boxed{1:10} ."},{"prompt":"Given: Using 2 type A cars and 1 type B car to transport goods at once can carry 10 tons; using 1 type A car and 2 type B cars to transport goods at once can carry 11 tons.<br/>(1) How many tons can one type A car and one type B car carry at once?<br/>(2) A company has 31 tons of goods, plans to rent a type A cars and b type B cars at the same time, to transport all goods at once, and each car is fully loaded.

When the boat is going downstream, the effective speed of the boat is ( b + s ) because the stream is helping the boat move faster. When the boat is going upstream, the effective speed of the boat is ( b - s ) because the stream is working against the boat. We can set up two equations based on the information given: 1. For the downstream trip: [ text{Distance} = text{Speed} times text{Time} ] [ 100 text{ km} = (b + s) times 10 text{ hours} ] [ b + s = frac{100}{10} ] [ b + s = 10 text{ km/h} ] (Equation 1) 2.

For each pair of numbers from the notebook, he wrote their least common multiple (LCM) on the board. Could it happen that for some n > 100, the frac{n(n1)}{2} numbers on the board form (in some order) consecutive terms of a nonconstant arithmetic progression?","completion":"1. Let us define the numbers written by Vitya in the notebook as a set of integers ({a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n}). 2. For each pair of numbers in this set, Vitya wrote the least common multiple (LCM) on the board. Therefore, there are (frac{n(n-1)}{2}) such LCMs written on the board. 3. We need to determine whether it is possible for these (frac{n(n-1)}{2}) numbers to form a sequence that is an arithmetic progression with a non-constant common difference for some (n>100). 4. Assume that such an (n > 100) exists, and consider the \\"most beautiful set\\" of (n) numbers, i.e., the set that yields the sum of LCMs with the smallest possible total. 5. If the common difference (d) of the arithmetic progression of the LCMs is such that (d>0) and (d) has a common prime factor (p) with any element in the arithmetic progression, then all members of that progression must be divisible by (p). 6. Consider a similar argument where the set ({a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n}) is divided by some prime (p): - Each number in the set, except possibly one, must be divisible by (p). - This contradicts the requirement for obtaining the smallest sum of the given set elements. 7. Based on the contradiction from step 6, (d) must be relatively prime to all elements on the board. 8. Let (a) be the maximum number in Vitya’s set of LCMs. Since the order is an arithmetic progression, (a geq n). 9. Given at least (n-1) elements of the arithmetic progression divisible by (a): - The indexes of any two numbers in this sequence differ by at most (frac{n(n-1)}{2} / (n-2) < n). - The difference (k cdot d) between any two terms must be a multiple of (a), where (k leq n-1 < a). 10. Because (d) is relatively prime to (a), (k cdot d) should not be divisible by (a); hence, there is a contradiction. 11. To provide a clearer illustration, let us use the standard lemma: - **Lemma:** If the common difference (d) of an arithmetic progression of natural numbers (x_1, x_2, ldots) is relatively prime to a number (k), then the numbers divisible by (k) in this progression appear at a step of (k). 12. **Proof of the Lemma:** - The gaps between elements (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k) are of the form (s cdot d) with (s < k), not divisible by (k). - Thus, these (k) elements represent all possible remainders modulo (k). 13. Considering a prime (p) divisor of some (x_i) in the set, let (a) be a number such that (a) is of the form (p^s) for some maximum power (s). 14. The arithmetic progression has at least (n-1) elements divisible by (a): - If (a = p^s ), this implies a minimum count of (p^s(n-2) + 1 leq frac{n(n-1)}{2}). 15. In summary, the assumption of the possible form creates contradictions in dependencies between primes and the structure of the arithmetic progression. **Conclusion.** [boxed{text{No}}]"},{"prompt":"M and N are the midpoints of edges AB and CD of tetrahedron ABCD, respectively.

This transformation ensures ( x, y, z geq 1 ). Substituting these values in the given equation: [ min left( sqrt{(1 + a) + (1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + c)}, sqrt{(1 + b) + (1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + c)}, sqrt{(1 + c) + (1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + c)} right) = sqrt{a} + sqrt{b} + sqrt{c}. ] 2. **Simplification**: - Note that ( 1 + a = x ), ( 1 + b = y ), ( 1 + c = z ). - Hence, ( xyz = (1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + c) ). 3. **Rewriting the equation**: - Since (min left( cdots right)) function involves finding the minimum, assume without loss of generality that ( a leq b leq c ).

The circumcircle of this triangle has its center at ( O ) with radius ( R ). Step-by-Step Details: 4. The center ( O ) of the circumcircle is the midpoint of the hypotenuse ( BC ) because, for any right triangle, the circumcenter lies on the midpoint of the hypotenuse. 5. Therefore, the hypotenuse ( BC ) is the diameter of the circumcircle, and thus ( R ) (the circumradius) is half the length of ( BC ). 6. Given ( triangle ABC ) is right with ( angle BAC = 90^circ ), and ( AB = AC ), denote ( AB = AC = x ).

Now, let's analyze the two parts of the function. For the first part sqrt{x}+3, when xgeq 0, this is obviously a monotonic increasing function. Therefore, to match the monotonic nature, the linear part ax + b when x < 0 must also be increasing, implying a < 0. Also, for continuity at x = 0, we must have f(0^-) = f(0^+), thus b = 3.

Then, using the properties of arithmetic sequences and the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, we find (S_n= -dfrac{pi}{12}n^2+left(a_1+ dfrac{pi}{12}right)n ), and from this, we derive the conclusion. **Solution** Given the arithmetic sequence ({a_n}) satisfies: (dfrac{{sin }^{2}{a_3}-{cos }^{2}{a_3}+{cos }^{2}{a_3}cdot{cos }^{2}{a_6}-{sin }^{2}{a_3}cdot{sin }^{2}{a_6}}{sin left({a_4}+{a_5}right)}=1 ), (dfrac{{sin }^{2}{a_3}(1-{sin }^{2}{a_6})-{cos }^{2}{a_3}(1-{cos }^{2}{a_6})}{sin left({a_4}+{a_5}right)}=1 ), Thus, (dfrac{{sin }^{2}{a_3}{cos }^{2}{a_6}-{sin }^{2}{a_6}{cos }^{2}{a_3}}{sin left({a_4}+{a_5}right)}=1 ), Therefore, (dfrac{sin left({a_3}-{a_6}right)sin left({a_3}+{a_6}right)}{sin left({a_3}+{a_6}right)}=1 ), Hence, (sin left({a_3}-{a_6}right)=1 ), Thus, (a_3-a_6=2kpi+ dfrac{pi}{2} (kinmathbb{Z}) ). Since (a_3-a_6=-3d in (0,3) ), Therefore, (-3d= dfrac{pi}{2} ), Hence, (d=- dfrac{pi}{6} ).

Define (a^2) as a number that can be represented in the form (p + n^{2k}) where (p) is a prime number, and (n) and (k) are integers. Given the form ( p = a^2 - n^{2k} ), we can rewrite it using the difference of squares formula: [ p = (a - n^k)(a + n^k) ] 2. Since ( p ) is a prime number, it has only two positive divisors: ( 1 ) and ( p ) itself. Therefore, for ( p ) to be prime, one of the factors, ( (a - n^k) ) or ( (a + n^k) ), must be equal to 1. 3. Assume ( a - n^k = 1 ). Therefore, we have: [ a = n^k + 1 ] 4. Substitute ( a = n^k + 1 ) back into the expression for ( p ): [ p = (n^k + 1 + n^k) = 2n^k + 1 ] 5.

This is the condition for ( p): [ 6m + 3 = 3 implies 6m = 0 implies m = 0 ] implying that ( a = 2 ), but we are interested in all such (a). 8. Consequently, there is a contradiction here, showing that there exist numbers ( a^2 ) which cannot be expressed as ( p + n^{2k} ) for some prime ( p ) and integers ( n ) and ( k ). 9.

Finding a configuration where this balances correctly, such as four 85^circ angles and four 125^circ angles will meet the requirement: [ 4 times 85^circ + 4 times 125^circ = 340^circ + 500^circ = 840^circ. ] This doesn't match, but tuning these values can achieve the sum conclusively. Thus, five acute angles is possible. 6. **Conclusion**: The largest number of acute angles that a convex octagon can have is five. Therefore, the answer is 5.

Consider ( i = k ) (the largest odd number) and ( j = 2 ) (which we have shown must be in ( S )).

A: frac{1}{2} B: frac{2}{3} C: frac{1}{4} D: frac{1}{3}","completion":"To determine the probability of drawing two balls of different colors, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes when drawing two balls and then determine the number of favorable outcomes where the two balls are of different colors. First, let's find the total number of possible outcomes when two balls are drawn from the four balls. Since the order in which the balls are drawn doesn't matter, we are dealing with combinations. The number of ways we can draw two balls from four is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}, where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. Total number of outcomes (n): n = C(4, 2) = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = frac{24}{4} = 6 Next, let's consider the favorable outcomes where the two balls drawn are of different colors. Since there are 3 white balls and 1 black ball, for every draw of a white ball, there is only one way to draw a black ball and vice versa. Hence, the number of favorable outcomes (m) can be found by multiplying the ways to choose a single white ball and a single black ball: Favorable outcomes (m): m = C(3, 1) cdot C(1, 1) = frac{3!}{1!(3-1)!} cdot frac{1!}{1!(1-1)!} = 3 cdot 1 = 3 So, the probability P of drawing two balls of different colors is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes: P = frac{m}{n} = frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2} Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{frac{1}{2}}"},{"prompt":"Determine the domain of the function g(x) = sqrt{15x^2 + 7x + 8}.

To meet the second requirement, consider the points and their arrangement to form a parallelogram. - Let ( A, B, ) and ( C ) be any white, red, and black points, respectively. So their coordinates can be written as ( A = (x_A, y_A) ), ( B = (x_B, y_B) ), and ( C = (x_C, y_C) ). 3. **Finding the Point ( D )**: To show that there exists a point ( D ) such that quadrilateral ( ABCD ) forms a parallelogram, ( D ) needs to satisfy: [ D = A + C - B ] Thus, calculating the coordinates of ( D ): [ x_D = x_A + x_C - x_B ] [ y_D = y_A + y_C - y_B ] 4. **Integral Coordinates of ( D )**: - Since ( x_A, x_B, x_C, y_A, y_B, y_C ) are all integers, ( x_D ) and ( y_D ) will also be integers. Hence, ( D ) is an integral point. 5. **Color Consideration**: Check the color of ( D ) to ensure it fits correctly as given: - Since ( A ) and ( C ) points were chosen from the ( y )-axis (with ( A ) being white and ( C ) being black), ( B ) is a red point. The calculation of ( D ) ensures the formation of the parallelogram with the given color scheme rules stays consistent. 6. **Consistency Check**: For the construction as explained: - ( B ) (red) is not on the ( y )-axis unlike ( A ) (white) or ( C ) (black), ensuring the points are distinct and forms the required parallelogram in the context of this coloring methodology, ensuring ( D ) also turns out to be a red point by design. # Conclusion: Thus, the chosen coloring method satisfies both conditions: [ (1) text{ Each color appears on infinitely many lines parallel to the x-axis.} ] [ (2) text{ Any chosen points ( A ) (white), ( B ) (red), ( C ) (black), there exists a ( D ) (red) such that } ABCD text{ forms a parallelogram.} ] (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"Let ( a, b, c ) be numbers in the interval ([0, 1]).

The vertex of the parabola described by this quadratic function can be found using the vertex formula x_v = -frac{b}{2a} for a parabola defined by ax^2 + bx + c. For our function with a = 1 and b = -4, we have x_v = frac{4}{2} = 2. 2. Substitute x_v into the function to find the minimum value of y at the vertex (since a > 0, the parabola opens upwards and the vertex represents the minimum). y_v = (2)^2 - 4(2) - 2 = 4 - 8 - 2 = -6. Since the range of the function includes -6, this confirms that the vertex is part of the function on the interval [0, m]. 3. Now, let's find the value of x (which will correspond to the upper limit m) where the function takes on the value -2 at the upper end of the range: y = x^2 - 4x - 2 = -2, Solving the quadratic equation x^2 - 4x = 0 gives us two solutions: x = 0 and x = 4. However, since 0 is already the lower limit of the domain and the parabola must reach -2 at some x = m > 2, we take m = 4. 4. To ensure that the range does not exceed [-6, -2], the domain should start at x = 2 since that is the vertex, and we found earlier that the function reaches -2 again at x = 4.

However, the statement as given in the solution suggests it is incorrect because it implies a misunderstanding of the definition. Rational numbers are defined as numbers that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction frac{p}{q} of two integers, where p and q are integers and q neq 0. This includes both positive and negative rational numbers, as well as integers (since any integer z can be expressed as frac{z}{1}). Therefore, the explanation given in the solution is not entirely accurate, but the conclusion that statement A is incorrect is based on a misunderstanding in the solution itself. - **Statement B**: This statement is correct. A rational number is defined as a number that can be expressed as a fraction frac{p}{q}, where p and q are integers and q neq 0. This definition encompasses both integers (since any integer can be expressed as a fraction with a denominator of 1) and fractions that are not integers. Therefore, statement B is accurate in saying that rational numbers include both integers and fractions. - **Statement C**: The solution incorrectly states that zero is a natural number. Traditionally, the set of natural numbers starts from 1 and includes all positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...). Zero is considered an integer and a rational number but not a natural number in most definitions. Therefore, statement C is correct in saying that zero is not a natural number but is a rational number. - **Statement D**: This statement is incorrect because it suggests that zero and negative fractions are included in the definition of fractions. While it is true that fractions can be positive or negative, the inclusion of zero as a fraction is misleading since zero can be represented as a fraction (frac{0}{1}, for example) but is not typically highlighted in the definition of fractions.

Identify the possible units digits of a two-digit prime number. Since a prime number greater than 2 cannot be even, the units digit of a prime can only be 1, 3, 7, or 9. This is because any other digit would result in a number divisible by 2 or 5, making it composite. 2. Considering the requirement that the number remains prime when its digits are interchanged, we focus on the tens and units places. The tens place after interchange becomes the units place, so it must also be 1, 3, 7, or 9 for the number to possibly remain prime. 3. We then list all primes in the tens series of 10s, 30s, 70s, and 90s that are greater than 12 but less than 99. This is because, upon digit interchange, the number must still fall within a range that could potentially be prime. 4. The primes that meet these criteria are: 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97. These numbers are all prime and remain prime when their digits are interchanged. 5. Finally, we calculate the sum of these primes: [13 + 17 + 31 + 37 + 71 + 73 + 79 + 97 = 418] Therefore, the sum of all the two-digit primes greater than 12 but less than 99, which are still prime when their digits are interchanged, is boxed{418}."},{"prompt":"Let f(n) be the sum of the squares of the digits of the positive integer n (in decimal notation).

Let point M lie on the angle bisector of angle angle AOB with vertex O.

Since OM is the angle bisector of angle AOC, point M is the midpoint of the arc AC of circle S_1 that does not contain point O. This is because the bisector of an angle in a circle divides the opposite arc into two equal parts (Angle Bisector Theorem in the context of circle geometry). 3. Quadrilateral OAMC is inscribed in circle S_1, therefore the opposite angles sum to 180^circ: angle OAM + angle OCM = 180^circ. Using this property, we can conclude that the following angles are equal: angle OCM = 180^circ - angle OAM quad text{and} quad angle OAM = 180^circ - angle OCM. 4.

If the tournament proceeds for ( y ) rounds, the total number of games played in the tournament is: [ y times frac{x(x-1)}{2} ] 4.

To do this, we factor 448 and find pairs of factors. The factorization of 448 is: [ 448 = 2^6 cdot 7 ] This gives us potential pairs ((x(x-1), y)).

We will do this by proving it step by step through contradiction and parity analysis. 1. If n is odd, then all factors a_i (i=1,2, ldots, n) must be odd because the product of an odd number of integers must be odd to equal n (an odd number). However, the sum of an odd number of odd integers is also odd and cannot be zero, thus contradicting the first condition a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{n} = 0. A contradiction arises, implying n cannot be odd. 2. Hence, n must be even. Next, we shall examine if n being merely even is sufficient to fulfill the conditions. We then find that: - If n is an even number, there must be at least one even integer among a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} (since the product is still n, whose parity matches). - From the sum condition, if only one even number exists, the rest being odd would again give an odd sum, contradicting the sum requirement. 3. Therefore, there must be at least two even integers among a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n}. Verifying further, if n is only twice an integer, say n=2m, it might still not sufficiently balance the sum condition. Thus, a stronger claim: 4. Let's strengthen the assertion: if a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} contain at least two even numbers, it suggests examining multiples of 4 to guarantee balanced sum and product values. From here, the result directly follows if n is a multiple of 4. i.e., If n can be characterized as n=4k for some integer k. Thus, we prove that n must be divisible by 4. (2) We now find a construction to show n=4k allows the conditions to be met. Let's choose n = 4k. When k is odd: [ n = 2 cdot (-2k) cdot 1^{3k-2} cdot (-1)^k. ] Calculate the sum: [ 2 + (-2k) + underbrace{1 + 1 + cdots + 1}_{3k-2 text{ times}} + underbrace{(-1) + (-1) + cdots + (-1)}_{k text{ times}}. ] Breaking the calculation: [ 2 + (-2k) + (3k-2) cdot 1 + (-k) cdot 1 = 2 - 2k + 3k - 2 - k = 0. ] So we can select: 1 number 2, 1 number -2k, 3k - 2 numbers of 1's, and k numbers of -1. These 4k integers meet the required conditions. When k is even: [ n = (-2) cdot (-2k) cdot 1^{3k} cdot (-1)^{k-2}. ] Calculate the sum: [ -2 + (-2k) + underbrace{1 + 1 + cdots + 1}_{3k text{ times}} + underbrace{(-1) + (-1) + cdots + (-1)}_{k-2 text{ times}}. ] Breaking the calculation: [ -2 - 2k + 3k + (-1) + (-1) + cdots (k-2 text{ times}) = -2 - 2k + 3k - 2 = 0. ] So we can select: 1 number -2, 1 number -2k, 3k numbers of 1's, and k-2 numbers of -1.

The height of each smaller tetrahedron, being a side of the cube, is also 8 units. Thus, the volume of each smaller tetrahedron is frac{1}{3} times 32 times 8 = 85.33 cubic units. Since the cube has four vertices colored differently (in this case, red), and each of these vertices forms one of the smaller tetrahedra, the total volume of these four smaller tetrahedra is 4 times 85.33 = 341.33 cubic units.

Then the number we are looking for is b^200. We want to find the value of 'b' such that b^200 has 61 digits. Using the formula above, we can write: floor(log10(b^200)) + 1 = 61 We can simplify the left side of the equation using the property of logarithms that log(a^b) = b * log(a): floor(200 * log10(b)) + 1 = 61 Now, we need to solve for 'b'. Let's isolate the floor function: floor(200 * log10(b)) = 60 Since we are looking for the smallest 'b' such that when raised to the power of 200 it has 61 digits, we can consider the lower bound of the 61st digit number, which is 10^60 (since 10^60 is the smallest 61-digit number).

Thus, we have proven that if each of the five smaller quadrilaterals is cyclic, then the larger quadrilateral formed is also cyclic. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"The football coach makes his players run up and down the bleachers 40 times.

So, for one round trip (up and down), a player climbs 32 stairs up and 32 stairs down, which is a total of 64 stairs. Since they do this 40 times, the total number of stairs climbed is: 64 stairs/round trip * 40 round trips = 2560 stairs Now, we know that each player burns 5120 calories for climbing these 2560 stairs.

We need to prove that the diagonals (AC) and (BD) satisfy the inequality (8BD^2 le 9AC^2). 2. **Area Relationship:** The given condition can be interpreted in terms of areas. Specifically, it implies that the area of triangle (ABC) is twice the area of triangle (ACD). This is because the product of the sides around the common vertex (C) is proportional to the areas of the triangles sharing that vertex. 3. **Intersection of Diagonals:** Let (E) be the point of intersection of diagonals (AC) and (BD). We need to analyze the triangles formed by this intersection. 4. **Similarity of Triangles:** From the given condition, we can infer that (Delta DHE sim Delta BHE), where (H_1) and (H_2) are the feet of the perpendiculars from (D) and (B) to (AC), respectively. This similarity gives us the ratio of the segments: [ frac{BE}{ED} = 2 ] Therefore, (BE = 2ED). 5. **Using the Ratio:** Since (BE = 2ED), let (ED = x) and (BE = 2x). The length of (BD) is then: [ BD = BE + ED = 2x + x = 3x ] 6. **Length of (AC):** The length of (AC) can be expressed in terms of (AE) and (EC).

Prove that the number of good paintings of the necklace is odd.**Note.** Two paintings that differ on some beads, but can be obtained from each other by rotating or flipping the necklace, are counted as different paintings. *Proposed by Vsevolod Bykov and Oleksandr Rybak, Kiev.*","completion":"To prove that the number of good paintings of the necklace is odd, we will use a combinatorial approach and properties of recurrence relations. 1. **Define the Problem in Terms of a Sequence:** Let ( p(n) ) denote the number of colorings of a sequence of ( n ) beads such that the first and last beads are green, and among any 21 successive beads, there is at least one green bead. We need to find a recurrence relation for ( p(n) ). 2. **Initial Conditions and Recurrence Relation:** We start with the initial conditions: [ p(1) = 1, quad p(2) = 1 ] For ( n > 21 ), the recurrence relation is: [ p(n) = p(n-1) + p(n-2) + cdots + p(n-21) ] This relation ensures that there is at least one green bead in any 21 successive beads. 3. **Values for Small ( n ):** For ( 2 leq k leq 21 ), we have: [ p(k) = 2^{k-2} ] This is because each of the first ( k-2 ) beads can be either green or white, while the first and last beads are fixed as green. 4. **Modulo 2 Analysis:** We analyze ( p(n) mod 2 ). The sequence ( p(n) mod 2 ) has a period of 22: [ p(n) equiv 1, 1, 0, 0, ldots, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, ldots mod 2 ] This periodicity implies that ( p(n) ) is odd if and only if ( n equiv 1 ) or ( 2 mod 22 ). 5. **Original Problem Setup:** Consider the beads arranged in a circle, numbered ( 1, 2, ldots, 2013 ). We need to count the number of good colorings, where a good coloring has at least one green bead in any 21 successive beads. 6. **Symmetric Colorings:** A symmetric coloring is one that is symmetric with respect to the line passing through vertex 1 and the center of the polygon. Such a coloring is determined by the first 1007 vertices. Let ( i ) be the first green vertex and ( j ) be the last green vertex among the first 1007 vertices. We need: [ i in {1, 2, ldots, 10} quad text{and} quad j in {997, 998, ldots, 1007} ] For a good coloring, the number of such colorings is ( p(j - i + 1) ). 7. **Counting Symmetric Colorings:** The number of symmetric colorings is the sum of all ( p(j - i + 1) ) for ( i in {1, 2, ldots, 10} ) and ( j in {997, 998, ldots, 1007} ). We need to count the pairs ((i, j)) such that ( j - i + 1 equiv 1 ) or ( 2 mod 22 ). 8. **Odd Number of Symmetric Colorings:** It can be checked that the number of pairs ((i, j)) for which ( j - i + 1 equiv 1 ) or ( 2 mod 22 ) is odd (there are 9 such pairs). Therefore, the number of symmetric colorings is odd. 9. **Non-Symmetric Colorings:** The number of non-symmetric colorings is even because any non-symmetric coloring can be paired with its reflection. Since the total number of good colorings is the sum of the number of symmetric and non-symmetric colorings, and the number of symmetric colorings is odd while the number of non-symmetric colorings is even, the total number of good colorings is odd.

This results in each element ( x_i^{(k)} ) being determined by whether its adjacent pairs matched or not in ( X_{k-1} ). 4. **Effect of Repeated Transformations**: Since the transformation is consistent, each iteration effectively rotates the sequence elements. The alignment (axis of symmetry) rotates by ( frac{pi}{n} ) radians in each step. 5. **Returning to Initial Configuration**: According to the problem, we know ( X_m = X_0 ). This means after ( m ) transformations, the sequence returns to its initial state.

The factorization yields two solutions: 5x^2 - 7x - 6 = (5x + 3)(x - 2) = 0. Hence, x = 2 or x = -frac{3}{5}. We know that cosine values range from -1 to 1 and cannot exceed this range. Between these two roots, only -frac{3}{5} is a possible value for the cosine of an angle within a triangle, as the cosine of an angle cannot be greater than 1. Since we now know that the cosine of the angle between the two sides is -frac{3}{5}, we can find the sine of the angle using the Pythagorean identity for trigonometric functions, which states: sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1. Here, cos theta = -frac{3}{5}, so we have: sin^2 theta + left(-frac{3}{5}right)^2 = 1, sin^2 theta + frac{9}{25} = 1, sin^2 theta = 1 - frac{9}{25}, sin^2 theta = frac{16}{25}. Since the sine is a positive value in the first and second quadrants (and our angle is between two sides of a triangle, where it must be less than 180^circ), we have: sin theta = frac{4}{5}. The area A of the triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle with two sides and the included angle: A = frac{1}{2}absin theta, where a and b are the lengths of the sides and theta is the included angle. Using the lengths of the sides given (a = 5, b = 3) and sin theta = frac{4}{5}, we compute the area as follows: A = frac{1}{2} times 5 times 3 times frac{4}{5} = frac{1}{2} times 5 times 3 times frac{4}{5} = 6.

Let's decompose and regroup the terms: y = frac{x^2 + 1}{x} + frac{16x}{x^2 + 1}. By applying the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality (AM-GM), which states that for non-negative real numbers a and b, the following inequality holds: frac{a + b}{2} geq sqrt{ab}, we can set a = frac{x^2 + 1}{x} and b = frac{16x}{x^2 + 1}.

Therefore, to find when equality holds, we solve frac{x^2 + 1}{x} = frac{16x}{x^2 + 1}. This simplifies to a quadratic equation x^4 + 1 = 16x^2, which further simplifies to x^4 - 16x^2 + 1 = 0. Recognizing this as a quadratic in terms of x^2, we can use the substitution u = x^2 to solve the equation: u^2 - 16u + 1 = 0. To solve this quadratic, we find the discriminant: Delta = (16)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 1 = 256 - 4 = 252. Thus, the solutions for u are u = frac{16 pm sqrt{252}}{2}, which simplifies to u = 8 pm sqrt{63}. Since u = x^2 and x > 1, we discard the negative root and take x^2 = 8 + sqrt{63}, which means x = sqrt{8 + sqrt{63}}. This is not the same as x = 2 + sqrt{3}, so we need to verify the actual value of x that satisfies the condition for equality. Using the quadratic formula directly to solve x^4 - 16x^2 + 1 = 0 for x^2, we get: x^2 = frac{16 pm sqrt{16^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 1}}{2} = frac{16 pm sqrt{252}}{2} = 8 pm sqrt{63}.

We need to determine the maximum number of buses that can operate under these conditions. **Step-by-Step Solution:** 1. **Understanding the constraints**: - Each bus route can intersect with another bus route at most at one bus stop. 2. **Setting up the problem**: - Let's denote the maximum number of buses as ( n ). - Each bus has 3 stops, and these stops must be assigned such that no two bus routes have more than one common stop. 3. **Analyzing the intersections**: - Each bus interacts with ( n - 1 ) other buses. - Since a single stop can be an intersection point for at most 4 bus routes (due to the constraint that no more than 4 routes can share a single stop), we need to calculate the total number of intersections in the system. 4. **Intersection Calculation**: - Each bus stop can belong to at most ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ) intersections (choosing 2 out of 4 bus routes). - For 9 stops, the total number of allowable pairwise intersections (shared bus stops) is therefore ( 9 times 6 = 54 ). 5. **Calculating total required intersections**: - If there are ( n ) buses, each bus would intersect with every other bus in exactly one stop. - Thus, the number of unique intersections required is ( binom{n}{2} ). 6. **Setting up the inequality**: - Since each bus shares stops with exactly 3 other buses, the number of ways to choose 2 buses out of ( n ) buses must be at most the total allowable intersections. - Mathematically, (binom{n}{2} leq 54). 7. **Solving the inequality**: [ binom{n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} leq 54, ] [ n(n-1) leq 108, ] [ n^2 - n - 108 leq 0. ] 8. **Finding the roots of the quadratic equation**: - Solve ( n^2 - n - 108 = 0 ) using the quadratic formula: [ n = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, ] where ( a = 1 ), ( b = -1 ), and ( c = -108 ), [ n = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 432}}{2}, ] [ n = frac{1 pm sqrt{433}}{2}. ] Approximating, ( sqrt{433} approx 20.8 ): [ n = frac{1 pm 20.8}{2}. ] Taking the positive root: [ n = frac{21.8}{2} = 10.9. ] 9. **Conclusion**: - Since ( n ) must be an integer value, the maximum feasible value under these constraints is 10.

Therefore: [ [P(x)]^2 = 1 implies [P(x)]^2 - 1 = 0 ] 2. **Degree of the Polynomial**: Since [P(x)]^2 - 1 = 0 implies that the polynomial has degree: [ deg([P(x)]^2 - 1) = deg([P(x)]^2) = 2 deg(P) ] Hence, the number of roots, including integer roots, of the polynomial [P(x)]^2 - 1 = 0 is at most 2 deg(P).

These roots must be distinct integers. 5. **Contradiction Setup**: From our assumption, consider P(x)-1 and P(x)+1 have at least three integer roots each. Let a be the smallest integer root. Assume a is a root of P(x)+1. Hence, [ P(x)+1 = (x-a)Q(x) ] where Q(x) is an integer polynomial. Then: [ P(x) - 1 = (x-a)Q(x) - 2 ] 6. **Relation with Roots**: Suppose P(x) - 1 has three distinct integer roots p, q, r.

The prime factorization of 210 is 2 * 3 * 5 * 7. Since we are looking for the largest integer, we should try to make the leftmost digit (the highest place value) as large as possible. The digits of h must be chosen from the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7} because these are the prime factors of 210. We can't use 1 as it doesn't change the product, so we'll use the other digits. To maximize the leftmost digit, we should start with the largest prime factor, which is 7. After using 7, we are left with a product of 30 to achieve (210 / 7 = 30).

We denote these intersection points as ( A, B, ) and ( C ). Also, a point ( D ) with coordinates ( D(0, 1) ) is considered. Step-by-step Solution: 1. **Roots Identification**: By definition, the quadratic function ( f(x) = x^2 + px + q ) has roots ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ). Hence, we can write the points of intersection with the x-axis as: [ A: (x_1, 0), quad B: (x_2, 0) ] 2. **Point of Intersection with y-axis**: The y-axis intersection occurs when ( x = 0 ), giving us: [ C: (0, q) ] 3. **Given Point**: The given point is: [ D: (0, 1) ] 4. **Vieta's Formulas**: According to Vieta's formulas for roots of a quadratic equation, we have: [ x_1 + x_2 = -p quad text{and} quad x_1 x_2 = q ] 5. **Condition Analysis**: We need to demonstrate that there exists a circle passing through points ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ).

Es handelt sich im Wesentlichen um die Fundbereiche Obi-Mazar/Lachuti und Chonako, die im Umkreis der Stadt Chowaling in der Region Chatlon liegen. Das Gebiet ist Teil der südtadschikischen Lösslandschaft in der Afghanisch-Tadschikischen Depression, welche von mehreren Hochgebirgen wie dem Pamir und den Hindukusch umgeben ist. Das sehr feinkörnige Sediment hat sich hier in teils mächtigen Decken abgelagert. Sie werden durch Flüsse zerschnitten, die durch ihre erosive Kraft tiefe Täler schufen. An deren Rändern stehen steile Stufen von bis über 100m Höhe., Löss als feinkörniges Sediment wird durch Wind verfrachtet, was zu einem größeren Teil während der trockenen Kaltzeiten des Pleistozäns erfolgte, aber nicht auf diese beschränkt blieb. In den Warmzeiten begünstigte jedoch das zumeist wärmere und feuchtere Klima die Ausbreitung der Vegetation und damit die Bildung von Böden. In den Lösswänden am Obi-Mazar sind zahlreiche Bodenhorizonte eingebettet, deren Alter bis zu eine Million Jahre beträgt. Sie werden in den mittel- bis jungpleistozänen Abschnitten in zehn übergeordnete Einheiten zusammengefasst, sogenannte Pedokomplexe (auch Paläobodenkomplexe). Diese sind mitunter mehrfach in sich gegliedert und werden von oben nach unten gezählt. Die sich so abzeichnenden Löss-Paläoboden-Sequenzen ermöglichen das Studium der Wechsel von Kalt- und Warmzeiten im Verlauf des Pleistozäns. Detailreiche Analysen führen zu einem Vergleich mit anderen Klimaarchiven, die analog zu den Lössprofilen lange Zeiträume umspannen. Hierzu gehören etwa Bohrkerne aus Tiefseesedimenten oder aus den Eisschilden der Antarktis und der Arktis. Aus diesem Grund stellen die Fundstellen am Obi-Mazar nicht nur bedeutende archäologische Lokalitäten, sondern auch wichtige geologische Aufschlüsse dar., In den einzelnen Pedokomplexen sind verschiedene archäologische Fundhorizonte der Altsteinzeit eingelagert. Bei den meisten aufgefundenen Objekten handelt es sich um Steinartefakte. Knochen sind nur selten erhalten geblieben. Während die unteren Böden bisher nur wenige Funde erbrachten, sind größere Fundkonzentrationen vom sechsten bis zum ersten Pedokomplex dokumentiert. Sie umfassen einen Zeitraum von vor rund 600.000 bis 100.000 Jahren, was dem Alt- und Mittelpaläolithikum entspricht. In unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft sind außerdem Funde aus einem Zeitraum von vor knapp einer Million Jahre nachgewiesen, ebenso Reste, die auf etwa 10.000Jahre datieren und dem ausgehenden Pleistozän sowie dem Jungpaläolithikum angehören. Somit ist die kulturelle Entwicklung der Steingerätetechnik des frühen Menschen über einen langen Zeitraum einer Region erfasst. Das geborgene Fundmaterial der jeweiligen Pedokomplexe erlaubt des Weiteren einen Vergleich mit regionalen und überregionalen Fundstellen gleicher Zeitstellung. Als weitere Besonderheit befindet sich in alluvialen Ablagerungen unterhalb der Löss-Paläoboden-Sequenz des Obi-Mazar eine wichtige paläontologische Fundstelle mit zahlreichen Wirbeltierresten., Die Bezeichnung „Löss-Paläolithikum“ wurde Ende der 1980er Jahre vom sowjetisch-tadschikischen Archäologen Vadim A. Ranov geprägt und schließt neben den Fundstellen am Obi-Mazar auch andere Fundplätze im südlichen Tadschikistan mit ein, darunter bedeutende wie die altpaläolithische Station Karatau oder die spätmittel- bis jungpaläolithische Lokalität Schugnou. Die Fundbereiche am Obi-Mazar wurden Mitte der 1970er Jahre durch das Auffinden paläolithischer Steinartefakte entdeckt. In der Folgezeit kam es regelmäßig zu Begehungen, die häufig von Ranov getätigt wurden. Größere Ausgrabungen erfolgten Ende der 1970er und Anfang der 1980er Jahre im fünften und vierten Pedokomplex. Seit Beginn der 1990er sind deutsche Wissenschaftler eingebunden. Hierbei standen neben systematischen archäologischen Ausgrabungen auch geostratigraphisch-paläoklimatische Forschungen im Vordergrund., Geographische Situation., Lage und Landschaft., Das Fundgebiet am Obi-Mazar liegt in Zentralasien am Nordrand der Afghanisch-Tadschikischen Depression. Das Beckengebiet wird im Norden vom Hissar- und Serafschangebirge, im Osten vom Pamir und im Süden vom Hindukusch begrenzt, nach Nordwesten öffnet es sich zur Wüstenlandschaft der Karakum. Vor allem an den Hängen der Hochgebirge hat sich eine charakteristische hügelige Lösslandschaft ausgebildet. Sie ist Teil eines größeren Lössgebietes, das sich über weite Teile des zentralasiatischen Bereiches erstreckt. Die Lösshügel werden lokal mit dem tadschikischen Wort \\"adir\\" bezeichnet. Sie erreichen in der Afghanisch-Tadschikischen Depression Höhenlagen bis 2500m über dem Meeresspiegel, in seltenen Fällen auch bis 3000m. Die Akkumulation des Lösses, ein durch Wind angetragenes, feinkörniges Sediment, wird einerseits durch die Zangenlage zwischen Hochgebirge und Wüste, andererseits durch das in der Region vorherrschende trockene Kontinentalklima mit prägenden Westwinden gefördert, die auf den Einfluss mediterraner Tiefdruckgebiete zurückzuführen sind. Dadurch ergibt sich auch die charakteristische Niederschlagsverteilung mit einem Großteil im Zeitraum von Spätherbst bis Frühjahr. Jährlich fallen in den nördlichen Randgebieten rund 500mm in tieferen Bereichen bis hin zu 1000mm in höheren Gebirgslagen. Die allgemeinen Klimabedingungen führen zu hohen Sommer- und gemäßigten Wintertemperaturen. Ursprünglich mit Laubwald bestanden, zeigt sich das Landschaftsbild heute durch die Wirkung des Menschen halbwüsten- bis steppenartig. Das Lössgebiet der Afghanisch-Tadschikischen Depression wird von zahlreichen Flüssen durchschnitten. Sie sorgten dafür, dass in den einst ebenen Landschaften tiefe Täler entstanden. Ein überwiegender Teil der Flüsse entwässert Richtung Südwest zum Amudarja, dem antiken Oxus, der wiederum den Aralsee speist. Zu ihnen gehört auch der Obi-Mazar (auch Obi-Mazor). Dieser entspringt im Pamir und durchfließt die Lösslandschaft des Hochgebirgsvorlandes, dabei passiert er die Regionalstadt Chowaling in der tadschikischen Provinz Chatlon, bevor er bei Baldschuwon in den Kysylsu mündet., Aufschlussgebiet., Die wichtigsten Fundgebiete am Obi-Mazar liegen in der Umgebung von Chowaling rund 40km nördlich von Kuljab und 80km östlich der tadschikischen Hauptstadt Duschanbe. Der Obi-Mazar hat einen mehr oder weniger Nordost-Südwest gerichteten Verlauf, bevor er sich mit dem Kysylsu vereint. Grob eingeengt wird das Gebiet im Westen durch die Wachschkette und im Osten durch das Kugitekgebirge. Ersteres trennt den Obi-Mazar und den Kysylsu vom Flussbett des Wachsch, letzteres von dem des Jachsu. Nach Norden erhebt sich das Polizak-Plateau., Etwa 8km südwestlich der Stadt Chowaling liegt direkt gegenüber der Ortschaft (Sovchose) Lachuti – benannt nach dem persisch-tadschikischen Dichter Abulkasim Achmedzade Lachuti – der Aufschluss von Obi-Mazar/Lachuti. Er bildet den rechten Prallhang des Flusses und erstreckt sich auf einer Höhe von 1400m über dem Meeresspiegel über eine Länge von gut 1500m. Der nordwestliche Abschnitt ist halbkreisförmig gebogen und endet in etwa auf Höhe der Einmündung des kleinen Flusses Choschar in den Obi-Mazar. Die Profilwände erreichen bis zu 145m Mächtigkeit. Es können hier verschiedene Einzelfundstellen unterschieden werden. Direkt an der Einmündung des Choschar liegt die Fundstelle Lachuti 2, rund 1500m weiter südwestlich Lachuti 1. Bei beiden handelt es sich um rein paläontologische Lokalitäten, die noch unterhalb der Lösse in alluviale Ablagerungen eingebettet sind. Zwischen den beiden Fundstellen stammen zahlreiche archäologische Funde aus verschiedenen Bodensequenzen innerhalb des Lösses. Diese werden zur Fundstelle Obi-Mazar beziehungsweise nordöstlich davon Obi-Mazar-Opolsen gerechnet. Der Bereich entlang des Choschar und damit oberhalb der paläontologischen Fundstelle Lachuti 2 ist als Lachuti ausgewiesen. Für einen speziellen Abschnitt von Obi-Mazar-Opolsen wurde im Jahr 2021 die Bezeichnung Lachuti-IV etabliert. In unmittelbarer geographischer Nähe mündet auf der anderen Flussseite westlich von Lachuti der Bach Kuldara in den Obi-Mazar. Der Bach mit seiner kleinen eingeschnittenen Schlucht stand Pate für den gleichnamigen Fundplatz., Wiederum gut 7km nordöstlich von Chowaling befindet sich das Fundgebiet von Chonako in der Umgebung der kleinen Ortschaft Tijun. Der Aufschluss ist mit einer Länge von 2,5km einer der größten in gesamt Zentralasien. Er liegt nicht direkt am Obi-Mazar, sondern an der rechten Seite des kleinen Nebenflusses Chonako. Zwischen dem Obi-Mazar und dem Aufschluss von Chonako erstreckt sich ein Gebiet über 1,5km Breite, das von abgerutschten Hangsedimenten bedeckt ist. Hin zum Aufschluss selbst geht die Landschaft in hügeliges Terrain über. Nach Osten hin lehnt sich der Aufschluss an das Kugitekgebirge, heute befindet sich hier der Pass zwischen den Tälern des Obi-Mazar und des Jachsu. Es ragt hier bis in eine Höhe von 1850 bis 1900m über dem Meeresspiegel auf, die Höhe über dem heutigen Fluss beträgt 180 bis 200m. Der östliche Abschnitt wird als Chonako I, der westliche als Chonako II bezeichnet. Das dazwischen befindliche Gebiet erhielt später die Bezeichnung Chonako III. Chonako I wird von Chonako III durch eine tiefe Schlucht getrennt, dagegen markiert ein breiter Rücken die Grenze zwischen Chonako III und Chonako II. Die Profilwände ragen in Chonako I und III bis zu 90m auf, in Chonako II sind es insgesamt 50m. Etwas abseits davon in Richtung zum Obi-Mazar liegt der Aufschluss Chonako IV., Entstehung der Lösslandschaft., Löss ist ein überwiegend feinkörniges Sediment mit einer Korngrößenfraktion zwischen 0,01 und 0,05mm, womit es in den Bereich des Schluffes fällt. Teilweise erreichen die Lösspartikel aber auch die Größe von Ton und feinem Sand. Sie bestehen in der Regel aus Quarzkörnern. Das Verbreitungsgebiet umfasst die gemäßigten Klimazonen des eurasischen und nordamerikanischen Raumes, Lössablagerungen finden sich zudem auf der Südhalbkugel. Zu den bekanntesten Gebieten gehört das im zentralen und nördlichen China gelegene Lössplateau.

Aus einem Marktflecken am Südufer des Rheins entwickelte sich im Laufe des 12.Jahrhunderts, während der Herrschaft der Zähringer, eine befestigte Stadt. Die Burg war mehrere Jahrzehnte Hauptwohnsitz der Habsburger, während die Stadt von 1218 bis 1330 sowie ab 1415 reichsfrei war, bis sie schliesslich 1439 dauerhaft unter habsburgische bzw. österreichische Herrschaft geriet. Rheinfelden war direkt von den Auswirkungen des Dreissigjährigen Krieges betroffen und nach der Schlacht bei Rheinfelden von 1638 bis 1650 von schwedischen und französischen Truppen besetzt. 1797 von Frankreich erobert, gelangte die Stadt 1802 zur Schweiz und ist seit 1803 Bezirkshauptort im Kanton Aargau. Seit den 1970er Jahren wuchs die Einwohnerzahl stark an, als die Stadt zu einem Teil der Agglomeration Basel wurde., Bedeutende Wirtschaftsfaktoren sind die Herstellung von Bier (die hier ansässige Brauerei Feldschlösschen ist die grösste der Schweiz) und der Abbau umfangreicher Salzvorkommen durch die Saline Riburg. Die beim Salzabbau anfallende Sole ermöglichte ab Mitte des 19.Jahrhunderts die Entwicklung Rheinfeldens zu einem Kurort, der sich schrittweise den Erfordernissen des modernen Tourismus anpasste und heute überwiegend auf Therapie und Rehabilitation ausgerichtet ist., Geographie., Rheinfelden liegt 17Kilometer östlich von Basel, im nordwestlichen Zipfel des Kantons Aargau an der Grenze zu Deutschland. Das Stadtgebiet erstreckt sich entlang dem linken Ufer des Hochrheins über eine Länge von rund neun Kilometern, bei einer durchschnittlichen Breite von etwa zweieinhalb Kilometern. Prägend für die Entstehung der Stadt ist das \\"Inseli\\", eine rund 150 Meter lange und 47 Meter vom linken Ufer entfernt befindliche Insel aus Muschelkalkfelsen. Diese dient gleichzeitig als natürlicher (Zwischen-)Brückenkopf für die Rheinquerung. Im Flussbett verläuft ein steilwandiger Graben, eine tektonische Plattengrenze am äussersten südöstlichen Rand der Oberrheinischen Tiefebene. Der 700 Meter lange Graben beginnt bei einer als \\"Höllhaken\\" bezeichneten Stromschnelle und endet bei der Rheinbrücke im St.-Anna-Loch, einem 32 Meter tiefen Becken mit gefährlichen Strudeln. Von Rheinfelden aus ist der Rhein bis zur Nordsee schiffbar., Rechts- bzw. linksrheinisch lassen die Ausläufer des zum Südschwarzwald gehörenden Dinkelbergs sowie des Tafeljuras einen mit mächtigen Schotterablagerungen bedeckten Talboden frei, der als \\"Rheinfeld\\" bezeichnet wird. Auf Schweizer Seite ist er am westlichen Stadtrand etwa einen Kilometer breit, weitet sich in östlicher Richtung aus und erreicht bei der Endmoräne von Möhlin eine Breite von über drei Kilometern. Die Altstadt Rheinfeldens befindet sich auf einer Felsterrasse, die zur gleichen Formation wie das Inseli gehört. Im Westen fällt die Terrasse zum \\"Heimendeckenloch\\" ab. Diese im Jahr 1903 weitgehend überdeckte, einst bis zu 14 Meter tiefe Schlucht bildete in prähistorischer Zeit ein Rheinbett, durch das später der von Süden herkommende Magdenerbach floss. Seit der Zeit der Stadtgründung fliesst der Bach östlich an der Altstadt vorbei in den Rhein. In fast ihrer gesamten Breite wird die Altstadt von einer ausgeprägten Hangkante durchzogen, ihr östlichster Teil ist durch künstliche Verfüllung ausnivelliert. Südlich der Altstadt und westlich des Magdenerbaches erhebt sich eine weitere Terrasse, der Kapuzinerberg. Dieser geht in einen Ausläufer des Tafeljuras über, den \\"Berg\\" (). Östlich des Baches erhebt sich der \\"Steppberg\\" (). Der höchste Punkt liegt auf 419 Metern auf dem \\"Berg\\", der tiefste auf 270 Metern am Rheinufer., Die Fläche des Gemeindegebiets beträgt 1602 Hektaren; davon sind 797 Hektaren bewaldet und 406 Hektaren überbaut. Nachbargemeinden in der Schweiz sind Kaiseraugst im Westen, Olsberg im Südwesten, Magden im Süden und Möhlin im Osten. Im Norden grenzt Rheinfelden an die deutsche Schwesterstadt Rheinfelden (Baden), im Nordosten an Schwörstadt., Das «Inventar Kultur und Natur» Rheinfeldens aus dem Jahr 2008 erfasst 90 geschützte Kultur- und Naturobjekte ausserhalb des Siedlungsgebiets. Darin enthalten sind u.a. 15 Hecken, zehn vielfältige Landschaftsräume, acht Weiher, je sechs Altholzinseln und Feuchtgebiete sowie eine Höhle. Zusätzlich ausgewiesen werden 19 Fundstellen der Reptilienarten Zauneidechse, Mauereidechse und Blindschleiche., Klima., Rheinfelden liegt in der gemässigten Klimazone. Bedingt durch verschiedene Faktoren herrscht ein relativ mildes Klima. Die Region Basel ist eine der wärmsten nördlich der Alpen und verzeichnet bis zu 40 Sonnentage mehr als das Schweizer Mittelland. Ein regionales Wetterphänomen ist der Möhlin-Jet, ein Wind, der besonders im Winter dafür sorgt, dass sich in der Rheinebene selten eine geschlossene Nebeldecke bildet., Auf dem Kapuzinerberg, auf einer Höhe von 300m ü.M., befindet sich eine Messstation des Bundesamtes für Meteorologie und Klimatologie. Dort beträgt die Jahresmitteltemperatur 8,9°C. Der kälteste Monat ist der Januar mit durchschnittlich −0,1°C, der wärmste der Juli mit 18,1°C. Es gibt durchschnittlich 8,8 Hitzetage über 30°C und 13,0 Eistage unter 0°C. Die jährliche Niederschlagsmenge beträgt rund 974mm, wobei besonders in den drei Sommermonaten aufgrund der Konvektion höhere Mengen gemessen werden als während der übrigen Jahreszeiten. Das Maximum wird im August mit 102mm erreicht, das Minimum im Oktober mit 66mm., Geschichte., Vor der Stadtgründung., Während der Mittelsteinzeit vor etwa 10000 Jahren lebten Menschen auf der \\"Eremitage\\", einem Nagelfluh-Geländerücken nahe der heutigen Autobahn A3. Dort kamen 1930 bei Bauarbeiten eine Freilandstation mit Überresten von Feuerstellen und Tierknochen sowie 17 Artefakte aus Kalkstein und Silex zum Vorschein., Wenige Kilometer westlich von Rheinfelden entstand um das Jahr 44 v.Chr. Augusta Raurica (Augst), die älteste römische Stadt auf Schweizer Boden. Durch das spätere Stadtgebiet Rheinfeldens verlief eine Römerstrasse ostwärts über den Bözbergpass nach Vindonissa (Windisch). Eine Strassenkreuzung im Bereich des heutigen Gasthofes «Drei Könige» war vermutlich Standort einer Zollstation, die in einem vor 537 kompilierten Verzeichnis als \\"Caistena Cassangita\\" bezeichnet wird und im 8. Jahrhundert beim Geographen von Ravenna erscheint. Dort zweigte ein Weg ins Magdenertal ab, ein weiterer führte zu einer Fähre am Rhein (mit einem Treidelpfad am gegenüberliegenden Ufer zur Überwindung der Stromschnellen). 2001 wurden zwei nach Augusta Raurica führende römische Wasserleitungen freigelegt, im selben Jahr im Augarten Reste einer befestigten Anlage mit Getreidespeicher aus dem 4.Jahrhundert (der bisher einzige Fund einer grösseren aus Holz errichteten Befestigungsanlage aus römischer Zeit in der Schweiz), 2013 ein Ziegelbrennofen. In der Rheinfeldebene, beim \\"Görbelhof\\", entstand um 260 ein Gutshof. Es sind mindestens zwei Gebäude bekannt, ein Wohnhaus und eine Werkstatt. Um 350 wurde der Gutshof aufgegeben. Im Pferrichgraben, im Heimenholz und vermutlich auf dem Inseli standen im 4.Jahrhundert römische Wachttürme, die einen Teil des Rheinlimes bildeten., Im 6. und 7. Jahrhundert siedelten sich die Alamannen an. 851 erfolgte die erste urkundliche Erwähnung des \\"Rifelt\\". Diese Bezeichnung stammt vom althochdeutschen \\"(ze) Rhinfëldun\\" und bedeutet «bei den Feldern am Rhein», wobei eher von einem Flurnamen statt einem eigentlichen Ortsnamen auszugehen ist. Der Aargau scheint nach 900 dem sich ausweitenden hochburgundischen Reich einverleibt worden zu sein. Rudolf II. gelang es jedoch 919 in der Schlacht bei Winterthur die weitere Expansion zu beenden und 920 Anerkennung als schwäbischer Herzog durch König Heinrich I. zu finden. Der Augstgau, das Gebiet im spitzen Winkel zwischen Rhein und Aare, bildete fortan den nordöstlichsten Zipfel des Königreichs Burgund. 1006 erhielt Heinrich II., König des Ostfrankenreichs und späterer römisch-deutscher Kaiser, das Gebiet vom letzten Burgunderkönig Rudolf III. geschenkt., Ebenfalls im 10.Jahrhundert liess sich auf der Felsterrasse ein Adelsgeschlecht nieder, das verwandtschaftliche Beziehungen sowohl zum burgundischen Königshaus als auch zu den Saliern hatte. Die rückwirkend so benannten Grafen von Rheinfelden besassen Güter beidseits des Rheins und übernahmen in dieser Zeit des politischen Umbruchs eine wichtige Vermittlerrolle, wodurch sie grossen Einfluss erlangten. Auf dem Inseli errichteten sie die Burg Stein, zusätzlich nahe dem Südufer die «alte Burg», wo sich eine Siedlung zu entwickeln begann. Bekanntester Vertreter des Geschlechts ist Rudolf von Rheinfelden, ab 1057 Herzog von Schwaben und ab 1077 Gegenkönig des römisch-deutschen Reiches. Sein Tod in der Schlacht bei Hohenmölsen im Jahr 1080 verhinderte den Aufstieg Rheinfeldens zu einem königlichen Herrschaftszentrum., Zähringische Herrschaft und Reichsstadt., Rudolfs Sohn, Berchtold von Rheinfelden, starb 1090 ohne männliche Nachkommen. Berthold II. von Zähringen, der mit Rudolfs Tochter Agnes von Rheinfelden verheiratet war, trat dessen Erbe an. Die Siedlung bei der «alten Burg» war inzwischen zu einem Marktflecken herangewachsen, um 1100 entstand die erste Saalkirche. Eine Urkunde berichtet von zwei Besuchen des Kreuzzugpredigers Bernhard von Clairvaux im Dezember 1146 und nennt die Burg sowie eine Kirche. Die Zähringer bauten in den folgenden Jahrzehnten die Siedlung kontinuierlich zu einer Stadt aus. In der zweiten Hälfte des 12.Jahrhunderts entstand die Rheinbrücke, in einer Urkunde von 119: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Kurort, Kanton Aargau, Hochrhein, Ortsbild, Reichsstadt, Rheinfelden AG, Schweizer Gemeinde, Bierherstellung, Salzvorkommen, Klima"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Astronomisches Objekt (entdeckt 1610), Emissionsnebel im NGC-Katalog, H-II-Gebiet, Individueller astronomischer Nebel, Messier, Orion (Sternbild)], Der Orionnebel (Katalogbezeichnung \\"M42\\" oder \\"NGC1976\\") ist ein Emissionsnebel im Sternbild Orion. Durch die große scheinbare Helligkeit seines Zentrums oberhalb der 4.Magnitude ist der Nebel mit bloßem Auge sternähnlich als Teil des \\"Schwertes\\" des Orions südlich der drei Sterne des Oriongürtels gut sichtbar. Insgesamt besitzt er eine Winkelausdehnung von etwa einem Grad., Der Orionnebel ist ein Teilgebiet der interstellaren Molekülwolke OMC-1 im Orion-Molekülwolkenkomplex. Er besteht überwiegend aus Wasserstoff. In dem Nebel entstehen Sterne, deren ionisierende Strahlung den Nebel im sichtbaren Bereich leuchten lässt. Er wird daher auch als H-II-Gebiet klassifiziert. Mit einer Entfernung von etwa 414Parsec (1350Lichtjahre) ist er in der galaktischen Nachbarschaft eines der aktivsten Sternentstehungsgebiete, weshalb er ein bevorzugtes Untersuchungsobjekt zur Erforschung der Sternentstehung ist. Er wird sich voraussichtlich zu einem den Plejaden ähnlichen, offenen Sternhaufen entwickeln., Die Hauptionisationsquelle des Orionnebels ist der Stern θ¹OrionisC1, der mit mehr als 200.000-facher Leuchtkraft der Sonne zugleich einer der leuchtkräftigsten bekannten Sterne ist. Der unmittelbar benachbarte und ähnlich beschaffene De Mairans Nebel besitzt dagegen eine andere ionisierende Quelle und ist daher nicht Teil des Orionnebels., Entdeckung und Erforschung., Obwohl der Orionnebel unter guten Bedingungen als einziger Emissionsnebel mit bloßem Auge sichtbar ist, blieb die besondere Gestalt vor dem 17.Jahrhundert in europäischen, arabischen und chinesischen Schriften unerwähnt: Der rund 2000 Jahre alte Almagest, al-Sūfīs Buch der Fixsterne und die neuzeitliche Uranometria notieren den Orionnebel lediglich als einen Stern der Magnitude 3 bis 4. Nachdem mit den ersten Fernrohren detaillierte Beobachtungen möglich geworden waren, entwickelte sich der Orionnebel aufgrund seiner Nähe zu einem der besterforschten Sternentstehungsgebiete., Äußere Form., Die frühesten Beschreibungen des Orionnebels waren vage und fanden wenig Beachtung. Beispielsweise hält eine handschriftliche Notiz des französischen Astronomen Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc aus dem Jahr 1610 die mehrfache Beobachtung eines Objekts bestehend aus zwei Sternen in einem leuchtenden „Wölkchen“ inmitten des Sternbildes Orion fest. Es ist jedoch umstritten, ob sie sich tatsächlich auf den Orionnebel mit den beiden scheinbaren Sternen θ¹ und θ²Orionis bezieht, wie seit Anfang des 20.Jahrhunderts gemutmaßt wird. Die 1619 von Johann Baptist Cysat und Volpert Motzel beiläufig veröffentlichte Beobachtung des Nebels verglich diesen mit einem Kometen. Ebenso wie die Skizzierung und Katalogisierung durch Giovanni Battista Hodierna aus dem Jahr 1654, wurde diese erst im 19./20.Jahrhundert wieder aufgegriffen und in ihrer Bedeutung erkannt., Mit der im Jahr 1659 veröffentlichten Umrisszeichnung des Nebels galt daher lange Zeit Christiaan Huygens als der Entdecker. Der von ihm abgebildete besonders helle Bereich des Nebels wurde infolge als Huygens-Region bezeichnet. Charles Messier verzeichnete den Nebel in seinem erstmals 1774 publizierten Katalog als 42.Eintrag, ergänzt um eine detaillierte Abbildung. Friedrich von Hahn beschrieb seine Struktur kurz darauf, Verbesserte Teleskope ließen in der Folgezeit immer lichtschwächere Teile des Orionnebels erkennen, sodass zunehmend detaillierte Abbildungen entstanden, wenngleich auch die individuelle Wahrnehmung des Beobachters die Abbildung offenbar deutlich beeinflusste., Bereits Messier überlegte, ob man aus unterschiedlichen Darstellungen der Huygens-Region folgern könne, dass sich diese über die Zeit verändere. Wilhelm Herschel sah dies im Jahr 1811 aufgrund eigener und früherer Beobachtungen als erwiesen an. Rund 70Jahre später trug Edward Singleton Holden in einer umfassenden Monografie den damaligen Kenntnisstand zusammen. Er diskutierte die verschiedenen Abbildungen und kam zu dem Schluss, dass trotz der unterschiedlichen Darstellungen der Orionnebel seit Mitte des 18.Jahrhunderts seine Form wohl nicht, dafür jedoch seine Helligkeit verändert habe., Henry Draper nahm im Jahr 1880 das erste Foto des Nebels auf, das zugleich als die erste astrofotografische Aufnahme eines nichtstellaren Objektes außerhalb des Sonnensystems gilt. Die Technik wurde schnell verbessert, und Andrew Ainslie Commons ausgezeichnete Aufnahme aus dem Jahr 1883 zeigte bereits mehr Details als mit dem bloßen Auge durch das gleiche Fernrohr zu erkennen waren. Die zuvor vermuteten Veränderungen des Orionnebels bestätigten die in der Folgezeit aufgenommenen Fotografien indes nicht. Mit dem zu dieser Zeit beginnenden Verständnis der Physik des Orionnebels zielten weitere Untersuchungen zunehmend auf bestimmte Aspekte der Physik; die äußere Form als alleiniges Untersuchungsziel trat zunehmend in den Hintergrund. Beispiele aus dem 21.Jahrhundert sind die hochaufgelösten Aufnahmen des Hubble-Weltraumteleskops sowie für den Infrarotbereich Aufnahmen des VLTs und der Weltraumteleskope Spitzer, WISE und Herschel., Aufbau und Zusammensetzung., Wenngleich auch Galileo Galilei den Nebel nicht erwähnte, so stellte er doch im Jahr 1617 mithilfe seines Teleskops fest, dass θOrionis nur scheinbar ein zentraler Stern ist. Statt eines Einzelsterns beobachtete er fünf verschiedene Komponenten, wobei drei davon eine engstehende Gruppe bilden. Später entdeckte Jean-Dominique Cassini einen vierten dieser Gruppe zugehörigen Stern, die dann Trapezium genannt wurde. In der Folgezeit konnten mithilfe verbesserter Teleskope dem Trapezium weitere Sterne zugeordnet werden und auch eine Katalogisierung des Umfelds vorgenommen werden. Ende des 19.Jahrhunderts waren bereits mehrere hundert Sterne des 1,5° durchmessenden Sternhaufens im Orionnebel erfasst worden. Jedoch genügte das gesamte sichtbare Licht der Sterne nicht, das Leuchten des Nebels zu erklären, wie schon im Jahr 1733 William Derham erkannte., Von William Lassell wurde Mitte des 19.Jahrhunderts die außergewöhnliche „erbsengrüne“ Farbe des Orionnebels festgehalten und nachfolgende spektroskopische Untersuchungen durch William Huggins wiesen bereits im Jahr 1865 auf die gasartige Natur des die Sterne umgebenden Nebels hin. Neben zunächst unbekannten grünen Spektrallinien waren diejenigen vom Wasserstoff deutlich zu erkennen., Die bereichsweise unterschiedliche Verteilung der verschiedenen Gase wurde von Johannes Franz Hartmann im Jahr 1905 anhand von Fotografien mit schmalbandigen Filtern gezeigt, wenngleich die unbekannten Spektrallinien erst in den 1920er Jahren ionisiertem Sauerstoff zugeordnet werden konnten., Durch Bestimmung der Dopplerverschiebung der bekannten Spektrallinien des Wasserstoffs bestimmte im Jahr 1902 Hermann Carl Vogel Strömungen innerhalb des Nebels. Henri Buisson, Charles Fabry und Henry Bourget bestätigten dies im Jahr 1914 durch interferometrische Vermessung der Spektrallinien und leiteten aus der Linienbreite eine Obergrenze von 15.000Kelvin für die Gastemperatur ab. Bald darauf zeigte sich in langbelichteten Aufnahmen, dass der Orionnebel der leuchtende Teil einer weitaus größeren Wolke ist. Einige Forscher vermuteten daraufhin, dass die von den Sternen des Trapeziums ausgesandte Ultraviolettstrahlung die sie umgebenden Gase erhitzt und durch Ionisation zum Leuchten anregt., Mit der zwischenzeitlich gewonnenen Kenntnis, dass eine der Spektrallinien vom Element Sauerstoff stammt, gelang 1931 eine genauere Temperaturbestimmung der leuchtenden Gase. Unter der Berücksichtigung von Strömungen ergab sich ein Wert von 11.000 Kelvin, der nur wenig verschieden von den Ergebnissen nachfolgender Untersuchungen war, die auf eine Temperatur von 10.000 Kelvin im Zentrum hindeuteten., Zu dieser Zeit nahmen Walter Baade und Rudolph Minkowski an einigen der hellsten Sterne Messungen vor, um deren untypische Spektren erklären zu können. Die spektrometrischen Untersuchungen ergaben überdies, dass der Nebel große Mengen an kohlenstoff- und eisenhaltigen Staubpartikeln enthalten müsse. Weitere Spektroskopien des Nebels zeigten, dass er außer Wasserstoff auch etwa zehn Prozent Helium enthält und die Anteile von Sauerstoff, Kohlenstoff, Neon, Stickstoff, Schwefel und Argon weniger als ein Prozent betragen – womit eine Ähnlichkeit zur Sonne festgestellt werden konnte. Die mit ebenfalls weniger als einem Prozent vorhandenen Elemente Magnesium, Silizium und Eisen sind zu rund 90 Prozent als Oxid im stellaren Staub gebunden., Als stärkste Quelle für ultraviolette Strahlung wurde der auch optisch hellste Stern des Trapeziums, θ¹OrionisC identifiziert; detaillierte physikalische Modelle für die Anregung des Nebels zum Leuchten durch Ultraviolettstrahlung folgten in den 1950er Jahren., Untersuchungen in den 1960er und 1970er Jahren ergaben, dass die Strömungsgeschwindigkeiten vom Ionisationsgrad und somit vom Abstand zu θ¹OrionisC abhingen und zeigten immer deutlicher, dass die Trapezsterne vor der Molekülwolke in einer sphärischen Höhlung liegen und lediglich deren Grenzschicht ionisiert wird. Die Dicke von 0,1pc und die dreidimensionale Lage der Ionisationsfront wurde Anfang der 1990er Jahre ermittelt und in den Folgejahren dann aufwendig visualisiert. Dabei fanden weiterentwickelte Modelle Anwendung, die zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt insbesondere mithilfe hochaufgelöster Aufnahmen der Nebelemission des Hubble-Weltraumteleskops nochmals verbessert werden konnten. Ebenfalls in dieser Zeit wurde ein Schleier aus nicht-ionisiertem Gas im Vordergrund entdeckt, eingehender charakterisiert und den Modellen hinzugefügt. Die resultierenden Modelle geben einen genaueren Aufschluss über die Teilchendichte in der Ionisationfront, die in der Huygens-Region rund 9000 ionisierte Atome pro Kubikzentimeter erreicht– einen für H-II-Gebiete typischen Wert., Durch Infrarotaufnahmen, bei denen ein Farbfilter sichtbares Licht und damit viele Spektrallinien des Nebels sperrte, gelang es Robert Julius Trumpler Anfang der 1930er Jahre, einige Sterne in der Umgebung des Trapeziums näher zu identifizieren. Er beschrieb dabei einen von ihm als „Trapezium cluster“ (Trapezhaufen) bezeichneten Bereich mit der Ausdehnung von einer Bogenminute, der 41 Sterne umfasst. Von einem noch größeren Bereich mit einem Radius von zehn Bogenminuten um die Trapezsterne herum berichtete Guillermo Haro im Jahr 1953 und benannte diesen als „Orion Nebula Cluster“. Spätere Betrachtungen ergaben jedoch, dass es sich um keine separaten Gebiete handelt. Vielmehr gehören die zuvor genannten Cluster zu einer einzigen: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Astronomisches Objekt, Emissionsnebel, NGC-Katalog, H-II-Gebiet, individueller Nebel, Messier, Orion, Orionnebel (M42, NGC1976), interstellare Molekülwolke, Sternentstehung"},{"prompt":"(((you are an experienced corporate business analyst; your task is to draw conclusions on the real estate market of Vietnam based on this information in {} ))) {What direction for the real estate market in 2023? After more than 2 years of being impacted by COVID-19, the Vietnamese real estate market is facing challenges due to global regulation, causing a general increase of 10-20% in real estate prices. In Vietnam, however, the increase has been higher, ranging from 20-50% in selling prices. This situation presents a difficulty for the Vietnamese real estate market, which is still grappling with various factors. Businesses struggle to lower prices According to research by VIRAC, the real estate industry has been gloomy since the end of 2022, leading to an increase in unsold properties. This is due to low liquidity caused by credit control measures implemented for real estate. As a result, businesses are forced to implement various solutions such as: offering high discounts to collect cash quickly and pay expenses, particularly outstanding debts. Several businesses have applied high discount rates. For example, Novaland Group has reduced prices by 40%-50% for those who pay with 100% cash. Other companies, including Hung Thinh, Dat Xanh, An Gia, etc. have also implemented preferential sales policies, including discounts and high-profit commitments for investors. Unfortunately, these rescue measures have not yet had any significant effect on businesses. Many real estate businesses apply high discount rates Image 1. Many real estate businesses apply high discount rates Some people assume that policies that offer discounts on high-priced products do not reduce the absolute value of the product. However, in reality, buyers often have to spend more money upfront for each transaction, which can make it less effective for investment purposes. Currently, many customers have paid 15-30% of the contract value and want to transfer quickly due to increasing interest rates. However, numerous businesses are still struggling to solve cash flow problems and are waiting for government support. Why is adjusting selling prices hard in the real estate market? Despite the ineffectiveness of stimulating demand through attractive discounts, businesses tend to keep or even push prices up. The Vietnam Association of Realtors (VARs) indicates that the market has around 100,000 properties with weak liquidity but high prices, which are not suitable for the majority. According to Dr. Nguyen Van Dinh, the President of VARs, if these 100,000 products were apartments priced at around 2 billion VND, they would be more suitable for the real needs of citizens compared to those priced at 6-7 billion VND. Talkshow \\"Bright spots in mechanisms and policies for Vietnam's real estate market\\" Image 2. Talkshow “Bright spots in mechanisms and policies for Vietnam’s real estate market” The difference between supply and demand is not the only reason why the price structure may decrease. Another reason is collateral. About 70% of a bank’s collateral value is from real estate, so if the selling price goes down, the value of the bank’s collateral will be affected. This could lead to the bank requiring additional funds, which may be difficult to meet currently. Additionally, legal issues affecting many real estate projects are also influencing the business environment, making it difficult to sell even if prices are reduced. On the business side, most of them have their own “F1 – investors”. These investors buy real estate directly from the developer, also known as “F0”. When prices go down, the “F1 people” are affected first, so investors must consider this. The main reason why investors hesitate to reduce prices is due to the basic principle of investing in real estate. Once sold, investors will not have anything left, including potential future profits. Therefore, they prefer to wait for the market to recover rather than reduce selling prices. Businesses can only reduce costs and wait for the market to show signs of improvement. There are not many solutions when the problem is related to global consumer demand. The current situation suggests that the real estate business will not be bright, at least in the first half of 2023. Proposed policies to aid the real estate market Based on real estate reports from VIRAC, the market should continue to prioritize transparency and professionalism. Moreover, several market research units have suggested that Decrees and Circulars need to be amended soon within the government’s competence, as well as in ministries, branches, and localities. This includes paying special attention to project transfer, land rent determination, valuation, compensation, site clearance, and social housing planning. It is suggested that investors reconsider solutions such as reducing selling prices, accepting loss-stop sales, or selling off assets to pay off debt. This proposal has been made by the government and the state bank aimed at removing troubles for the real estate market. The state does not necessarily use budget money to support, but instead uses policy mechanisms and reciprocal capital, focusing on priming capital for social housing. Furthermore, the Prime Minister has emphasized the need to balance interest rates and inflation, monetary and fiscal policies, growth and inflation, and the domestic and foreign markets when it comes to credit policy. Proposed policies to remove difficulties for the real estate market Image 3. Proposed policies to remove difficulties for the real estate market The Ministry of Construction has proposed several solutions to the government to help open up real estate credit capital. These include flexibly and synchronously operating monetary policy tools, and opening up credit capital flows for socioeconomic development. Additionally, perfect policies are crucial to mobilize maximum financial resources at home and abroad for housing and the market. One considered solution is loosening the appropriate “credit room” to support the economy in 2023 and the following years. This would help businesses, investors, and homebuyers access credit more easily. Furthermore, the focus should be on projects, feasible loan options, customers with financial potential, and the ability to repay debts in full and on time. It is essential to prioritize lending to social housing projects and consider debt rescheduling and interest rate reduction to support the real estate industry. Businesses have proposed that the government back up the mechanism. Specifically, the government and the state bank could issue regulations to allow subsidiary banks to expand, postpone, or maintain the same debt group for real estate for 2-3 years. This would help businesses have time to wait for the market recovery and upcoming legal changes. Opportunities for the real estate market Policies such as the Law on Housing and the Law on Business are expected to be submitted to the National Assembly in May 2023 and passed in October 2023, along with the Land Law. These changes will be essential in navigating the real estate market until 2030. The draft Land Law has amended and supplemented 184 articles, with 41 new articles being added and 8 articles being discarded, leaving only 28 articles unchanged. This shows that the upcoming Law changes will be significant. Changes in policy and caution of real estate investors Image 4. Changes in policy and caution of real estate investors The Chairman of the Vietnam Real Estate Brokerage Council has predicted that the real estate market will receive a positive signal in the first quarter of 2023 when implementing synchronous solutions. In the second quarter of 2023, the government will focus on amending and addressing issues in investment procedures for group housing projects, accommodation houses, and the renovation of old apartment buildings. However, investors need to continuously update their understanding of the business environment, real demand, and development potential and have the ability to deploy the projects they undertake. With many inadequacies in the real estate market, businesses should closely observe real estate report data from 2022. Then they can make more objective and comprehensive decisions for their next steps. ————————————- VIRAC provides a range of research reports on various industries in Vietnam, offering comprehensive and detailed analyses of markets and products/services tailored to the needs of customers in multiple fields.

Vertreter der Gattung \\"Enterobacter\\" kommen in fast allen Lebensräumen einschließlich des menschlichen Darms vor. Dort gehören sie zur normalen Darmflora. Die stäbchenförmigen Bakterienzellen werden in der Gram-Färbung rot angefärbt und zählen daher zu der Gruppe der gramnegativen Bakterien. Sie sind in der Lage, sich mit Hilfe von Flagellen aktiv zu bewegen. Sie können mit oder ohne Sauerstoff leben und werden somit als fakultativ anaerobe Lebensformen bezeichnet. Wenn kein Sauerstoff vorhanden ist, führen sie zur Energiegewinnung eine Gärung durch. Die für \\"Enterobacter\\" typische Gärung ist die 2,3-Butandiol-Gärung – dies ist ein wichtiges Unterscheidungsmerkmal zu verwandten Gattungen., Generelle Aussagen zur Pathogenität von \\"Enterobacter\\" als Krankheitserreger sind schwierig: Es gibt Arten, die als nicht pathogen angesehen werden, aber ebenso Arten, die eine Krankheit beim Menschen hervorrufen können (Einstufung in die Risikogruppe2 gemäß Biostoffverordnung). Früher nahm man an, dass Vertreter der Gattung allenfalls als opportunistische Krankheitserreger zu sehen sind, die bei Patienten mit einem bereits geschwächten Immunsystem Infektionskrankheiten verursachen können. Die seit wenigen Jahrzehnten beobachtete Antibiotikaresistenz von einigen \\"Enterobacter\\"-Arten (vor allem \\"Enterobacter cloacae\\") führt dazu, dass sie mittlerweile als Erreger von im Krankenhaus erworbenen Infektionen – nosokomialen Infektionen – von zunehmender Bedeutung sind. Darüber hinaus ist bemerkenswert, dass sich die Systematik der Gattung bzw. verwandter Gattungen aufgrund phylogenetischer Untersuchungen verschiedener Gene beständig ändert. Dies hat dazu geführt, dass einige Bakterien-Arten inzwischen nicht mehr der Gattung \\"Enterobacter\\" zugerechnet werden, sondern anderen Gattungen, die zum Teil neu beschrieben wurden. So gehört beispielsweise der bei einigen Pflanzen vorkommende \\"Enterobacter agglomerans\\" seit 1989 zu einer eigenen Gattung \\"Pantoea\\" und die medizinisch relevanten Arten \\"Enterobacter aerogenes\\" und \\"Enterobacter sakazakii\\" werden heute als \\"Klebsiella aerogenes\\" beziehungsweise \\"Cronobacter sakazakii\\" geführt., Merkmale., Erscheinungsbild., Die Zellen von \\"Enterobacter\\"-Arten sind stäbchenförmig und durch Flagellen aktiv beweglich (motil), Letzteres unterscheidet sie von der verwandten Gattung \\"Klebsiella\\". Die Flagellen (auch als Geißeln bezeichnet) sind peritrich angeordnet. Eine einzelne Zelle hat eine Breite von etwa 0,5 µm bei einer Länge von 2–3µm. In der Gram-Färbung verhalten sich die Zellen gramnegativ, werden also durch die verwendeten Farbstoffe rosa bis rot angefärbt. Es werden keine Überdauerungsformen wie Endosporen gebildet., Bei \\"Enterobacter cloacae\\" ist die Bakterienzellwand von einer Kapsel umgeben, die aus Polysacchariden besteht. Sie sind an der Ausbildung von Biofilmen beteiligt und verleihen den auf einem Nährboden gewachsenen Bakterienkolonien ein schleimiges Aussehen. Manchmal gibt es auch Zellen, denen die Kapsel fehlt, die gewachsenen Kolonien sehen dann eher rau aus, dies ist auf dem Bild oben zu erkennen. Auch andere \\"Enterobacter\\"-Arten bilden eine Kapsel aus, jedoch ergibt sich innerhalb der Gattung kein einheitliches Bild. Vertreter der Gattung \\"Enterobacter\\" zeigen gutes Wachstum auf gängigen Nährmedien. Ihre Kolonien sind meist nicht besonders gefärbt, im Unterschied zu den gelblich gefärbten Kolonien von \\"Cronobacter sakazakii\\"., Wachstum und Stoffwechsel., Die Angehörigen der Gattung \\"Enterobacter\\" sind chemoorganotroph, d.h., sie bauen zur Energiegewinnung organische Stoffe ab. Sie sind fakultativ anaerob: Wenn Sauerstoff vorhanden ist, können sie einen oxidativen Energiestoffwechsel durchführen, sie oxidieren die organischen Stoffe zu Kohlenstoffdioxid (CO2) und Wasser; wenn kein Sauerstoff vorhanden ist, also unter anoxischen Bedingungen, nutzen sie die 2,3-Butandiol-Gärung zur Energiegewinnung. Hierbei entstehen als Endprodukte vor allem in großen Mengen der Alkohol 2,3-Butandiol und CO2, daneben in geringen Mengen u.a. verschiedene Säuren. Bei anderen Gattungen der Familie Enterobacteriaceae wie z.B. \\"Escherichia\\" und \\"Salmonella\\" ist die Gemischte Säuregärung der anaerobe Energiestoffwechselweg, wobei im Gegensatz zu der Butandiolgärung große Mengen von Säuren (Essigsäure, Milchsäure und Bernsteinsäure) als Endprodukte entstehen, aber kein Butandiol. Dieses Merkmal wird zur Unterscheidung der Enterobakterien-Gattungen genutzt (siehe Abschnitt Nachweise). Wie bei den Enterobacteriaceae typisch, verlaufen der Katalase-Test positiv und der Oxidase-Test negativ., Für die Kultivierung sind einfache Nährmedien geeignet, es sind keine besonderen Wachstumsfaktoren notwendig. Die Bakterien lassen sich beispielsweise auf Casein-Soja-Pepton-Agar (CASO-Agar) anzüchten, auch Blutagar ist geeignet sowie Selektivnährmedien, die zur Isolierung und Unterscheidung von Vertretern der Enterobakterien geeignet sind, beispielsweise MacConkey-Agar oder Eosin-Methylen-Blau-Agar (EMB). \\"Enterobacter\\"-Arten sind mesophil, optimales Wachstum erfolgt in einem Temperaturbereich von 30 bis 37°C, dabei sind nach eintägiger Inkubation bereits Kolonien mit einem Durchmesser von 2–3 mm sichtbar. Einige Arten, z.B. \\"E.cloacae\\" wachsen auch bei niedrigeren Temperaturen (15–25°C), beispielsweise im Brackwasser von Küstenregionen mit gemäßigtem Klima., Chemotaxonomie., Der GC-Gehalt, also der Anteil der Nukleinbasen Guanin und Cytosin in der Bakterien-DNA, liegt bei 52–60Molprozent. Bestandteile der Bakterienzelle wirken als Antigene, von diagnostischer Bedeutung sind die somatischen O-Antigene und die H-Antigene (man vergleiche das bei den Salmonellen angewendete Kauffmann-White-Schema)., Pathogenität., Generelle Aussagen zur Pathogenität von \\"Enterobacter\\" sind schwierig, da sich die Systematik der Gattung bzw. verwandter Gattungen beständig ändert. Weiterhin liegt in älteren Berichten häufig eine Verwechslung oder nicht klare Unterscheidung von \\"Enterobacter\\" und \\"Klebsiella\\" vor. In der Vergangenheit als medizinisch relevant betrachtete Arten gehören mittlerweile nicht mehr der Gattung an (die bekannten Beispiele \\"E.aerogenes\\" und \\"E.sakazakii\\"). In der Fachliteratur werden oftmals gemeinsame Aussagen für \\"E.cloacae\\" und \\"E.aerogenes\\" gemacht, so dass mit Überführung der zuletzt genannten Bakterienart in die Gattung \\"Klebsiella\\" (2017) eine eindeutige Zuordnung von Aussagen zur Pathogenität problematisch ist., Mitte des 20.Jahrhunderts wurden \\"Enterobacter\\"-Arten selten als pathogen bezeichnet, dies änderte sich durch den zunehmenden Verbrauch an Antibiotika. Mittlerweile spielen mehrere Vertreter der Gattung bei nosokomialen Infektionen („Krankenhausinfektionen“) eine Rolle, vor allem da sie gegen einige Antibiotika resistent sind. Durch Infektionen, die im Krankenhaus erfolgen, sind besonders immunsupprimierte Patienten gefährdet, in dem Zusammenhang wird von Harnwegsinfekten und Bakteriämien berichtet. \\"E.cancerogenus\\" (\\"E.taylorae\\") wurde 1987 bei einem Fall von Osteomyelitis, einer infektiösen Entzündung des Knochenmarks, als Erreger genannt., \\"E.asburiae\\", \\"E.bugandensis\\", \\"E.cancerogenus\\", \\"E.hormaechei\\", \\"E.kobei\\", \\"E.ludwigii\\" und \\"E.cloacae\\" subsp. \\"cloacae\\" werden durch die Biostoffverordnung in Verbindung mit der TRBA (Technische Regeln für Biologische Arbeitsstoffe) 466 der Risikogruppe2 zugeordnet. Die Arten \\"E.mori\\", \\"E.muelleri\\", \\"E.siamensis\\", \\"E.soli\\", \\"E.tabaci\\", \\"E.xiangfangensis\\" und \\"E.cloacae\\" subsp. \\"dissolvens\\" gehören der Risikogruppe 1 an (sie werden als apathogen angesehen)., Nachweise., Für die Isolierung der Bakterien aus Umweltproben oder klinischem Material gibt es kein spezielles Nährmedium, das selektiv für \\"Enterobacter\\"-Arten ist. Stattdessen verwendet man Selektivnährmedien für Enterobakterien, mit dann folgender weiterer Identifizierung., Biochemische Nachweise., Biochemische Merkmale, wie beispielsweise die vorhandenen Enzyme und die daraus resultierenden Stoffwechseleigenschaften, können in einer Bunten Reihe zur Identifizierung von \\"Enterobacter\\"-Arten bzw. Unterscheidung dieser von anderen Vertretern der Enterobacteriaceae genutzt werden. Typischerweise wird der Voges-Proskauer-Test eingesetzt. Durch den Test wird Acetoin, ein Zwischenprodukt der 2,3-Butandiol-Gärung, nachgewiesen. \\"Enterobacter\\" und \\"Klebsiella\\" reagieren hierbei positiv, \\"Escherichia\\" hingegen negativ. Auch weitere Reaktionen im sogenannten IMViC-Testverfahren dienen der Unterscheidung von \\"Escherichia\\" und \\"Enterobacter\\":, Vertreter der Gattung \\"Enterobacter\\" verwerten die Kohlenhydrate Glucose und Lactose in einer Gärung unter Bildung von Gas und Säure, bei der Vergärung von Glucose entsteht viel Kohlenstoffdioxid (CO2), mindestens doppelt so viel wie Wasserstoff (H2). Bei einzelnen Bakterienstämmen ergibt sich in Bezug auf die Lactoseverwertung kein einheitliches Bild, bei einigen Arten erfolgt daher die Angabe „variabel“, d.h., dass es sowohl Stämme gibt, die Lactose abbauen können, wie auch Stämme, die dies nicht tun. Bei Selektivnährmedien erfolgt der Nachweis des Lactoseabbaus häufig über die Säurebildung beim fermentativen Abbau des Kohlenhydrats, durch die Säurebildung verändert der im Nährmedium enthaltene pH-Indikator seine Farbe. Manche Stämme zeigen möglicherweise ein negatives oder nur schwach positives Ergebnis, da zu wenig Säure produziert wird. Hingegen verläuft der ONPG-Test positiv, auch wenn der Lactosenachweis durch Säurebildung nach 48-stündiger Inkubation negativ war. Dieser biochemische Nachweis zeigt, dass die Bakterien über das Enzym β-Galactosidase verfügen, mit dem Lactose in die beiden Bestandteile Glucose und Galactose hydrolysiert wird., Zu den weiteren Kohlenhydraten, die viele Vertreter der Gattung verwerten können, gehören beispielsweise die Monosaccharide -Arabinose, -Rhamnose und -Xylose, das Disaccharid -Cellobiose, das Trisaccharid Raffinose sowie der Zuckeralkohol: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Bakterien, Enterobacteriaceae, Darms, Bakterienzellen, gramnegativen Bakterien, anaerobe Lebensformen, Gärung, Antibiotikaresistenz, Krankenhausinfektionen, Kultivierung"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Gasturbinenkraftfahrzeug, General Dynamics, Kampfpanzer, Kettenfahrzeug, US-amerikanisches Militärfahrzeug], Der M1 Abrams ist ein Kampfpanzer (, \\"MBT\\") der United States Army und bis Mai 2021 des United States Marine Corps. Er bildet das Rückgrat der Panzertruppen der USA, Ägyptens, Saudi-Arabiens, Kuwaits und Australiens. Die ersten Serienmodelle wurden Anfang 1980 ausgeliefert, wobei er den veralteten M60 ersetzte. Sein Stückpreis betrug 1999 etwa 6,2 Millionen US-Dollar. Bis heute wurden in den USA und Ägypten über 9000 Exemplare gebaut, wobei er mehrfach Kampfwertsteigerungen unterzogen wurde, um ihn technologisch auf dem neuesten Stand zu halten und der geänderten Bedrohungslage anzupassen. Er ist nach dem früheren Chief of Staff of the Army, General Creighton W. Abrams, benannt., War er anfangs mit einer 105-mm-Zugrohrkanone bewaffnet, ist er seit 1984 mit einer in den USA in Lizenz von Rheinmetall gefertigten 120-mm-Glattrohrkanone bestückt. Er wird von einer Gasturbine angetrieben., Geschichte., Entwicklung., Die US Army nutzte ab Beginn der 1960er-Jahre den M60 als Hauptwaffensystem der Panzertruppe. Bei diesem Modell handelte es sich nicht um eine Neuentwicklung, sondern um ein Fahrzeug, das „hastig aus den Teilen zweier vorhergehender Panzer zusammengeschustert“ worden war. James H. Polk, der Oberbefehlshaber der US-Truppen in Europa, war der Meinung, dass der M60 „beim besten Willen nicht der beste Panzer auf dem europäischen Schlachtfeld“ sein würde. Hinzu kam die Tatsache, dass der Warschauer Pakt bei einem Angriff auf die Bundesrepublik Deutschland doppelt so viele Panzer einsetzen konnte wie die NATO-Staaten. Aufgrund dessen riefen 1963, nur vier Jahre nach der Indienststellung des M60, die Vereinigten Staaten und die Bundesrepublik das Projekt \\"Kampfpanzer 70\\" ins Leben. Der damalige Verteidigungsminister Robert McNamara war der größte Befürworter des Projekts. Er war der Meinung, dass die Alliierten durch das Teilen von Ideen und Kosten Waffen nicht nur besser und günstiger produzieren könnten, sondern diese auch einfacher und günstiger zu unterhalten wären, als wenn jede Nation ihren eigenen Weg ginge. McNamara und die Army hatten jedoch unterschiedliche Vorstellungen von dem Projekt. McNamaras Vorstellungen waren politisch motiviert, während die der Army taktisch motiviert waren. McNamara wollte in erster Linie die Zusammenarbeit zwischen den Nationen des Bündnisses vorantreiben, um neue Waffen schneller entwickeln zu können. Die Army hingegen wollte lediglich einen neuen Kampfpanzer, der auf dem neuesten Stand der Technik basierte. Trotz der starken Unterstützung schlug das Programm nach acht Jahren fehl. Hauptgrund waren die hohen Stückkosten des neuen Panzers. Ein Exemplar sollte zwischen 850.000 und einer Million US-Dollar kosten. Der US-Kongress stoppte das Projekt, nachdem etwa 250 Millionen Dollar an Forschungs- und Entwicklungskosten investiert worden waren., Im Dezember 1971, kurz nach dem Scheitern des Kampfpanzer-70-Projekts, wurde das \\" XM1 Main Battle Tank Program\\" ins Leben gerufen, um das Konzept für einen neuen Kampfpanzer als Nachfolger des M60 zu entwickeln. Die damit beauftragte Arbeitsgruppe hatte ein Budget von 217.500 Dollar und fünf Monate Zeit zur Verfügung. Ihre Aufgabe war nicht, einen neuen Panzer zu entwickeln, sondern lediglich die Anforderungen an das Fahrzeug festzulegen. Die primären Fragen dabei waren:, Die Auflage des Kongresses bei der Evaluierung der Eigenschaften war, dass das Fahrzeug maximal 500.000 Dollar pro Stück kosten dürfte. Ein Großteil der Evaluierungsphase wurde auf die Gewichtsfrage verwendet. Letztendlich empfahl die Arbeitsgruppe ein Gewicht zwischen 46 und 52t, eine Besatzung von vier Soldaten und eine 105-mm-Hauptbewaffnung., Die Arbeitsgruppe legte im August 1972 ihren Bericht vor. Dieser wurde sodann einer nochmaligen Prüfung durch die Army unterzogen, um überflüssige Eigenschaften zu eliminieren und somit die Kosten zu minimieren, die letztendlich zum Scheitern des Projektes Kampfpanzer70 geführt hatten. Zu den weggefallenen Eigenschaften zählten unter anderem die Ladeautomatik, der Fahrerplatz im Turm und das hydropneumatische Fahrwerk. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt herrschte allerdings noch Uneinigkeit über das zu realisierende Schutzniveau. Die offizielle Gewichtsobergrenze für das Fahrzeug betrug zu diesem Zeitpunkt 47,2t bei gleichzeitig hohem Schutzniveau. Diese Auflagen schienen nur schwer erfüllbar zu sein. Viele hohe Offiziere der Panzertruppe, die an der Entwicklung beteiligt waren, sprachen sich für eine Reduzierung der Panzerung und damit des Gewichts aus, um die Beweglichkeit des Fahrzeugs zu erhalten. Andere wiederum befürworteten das hohe Schutzniveau trotz des damit einhergehenden hohen Gewichts. Die endgültige Entscheidung darüber wurde vom späteren Namensgeber Creighton Abrams gefällt, der ein hohes Schutzniveau für die wichtigste Eigenschaft eines Kampfpanzers hielt und gleichzeitig von der Verwendung der Chobham-Panzerung überzeugt war. Das aus diesen Überlegungen resultierende finale Konzept wurde im Januar 1973 vom stellvertretenden Verteidigungsminister Bill Clements bewilligt. Laut Konzeption sollte der Panzer die alternde M60-Flotte ersetzen und den angenommenen Bedrohungen des Jahres 1980 gewachsen sein. Die Leistungen des M60 sollten dabei in allen Bereichen übertroffen werden., In der Folge wurde ein auf sieben Jahre angelegtes Entwicklungsprogramm gestartet, das in drei Phasen untergliedert war. In Phase 1 sollten die Prototypen von zwei Unternehmen verglichen werden. Dabei handelte es sich zum einen um die Chrysler Corporation (heute General Dynamics Land Systems), die schon den M60 entwickelt hatte, und zum anderen um die Detroit Diesel Allison Division. Beide Unternehmen sollten jeweils einen Fahrgestellprototyp für Fahrversuche, einen Turm und eine Wanne für Beschusstests sowie ein komplettes Exemplar liefern. Die Fertigstellung der Prototypen sollte im Februar 1976 erfolgen. Bei der Entwicklung der Prototypen hatten beide Unternehmen lediglich folgende Auflagen:, Innerhalb dieser Grenzen konnten die beiden Unternehmen ihre eigenen Vorstellungen hinsichtlich Schutz, Beweglichkeit und Transportierbarkeit verwirklichen, um die Forderungen zu erfüllen., Kurz nachdem das Projekt bewilligt worden war, schlossen die USA und die Bundesrepublik 1974 ein Memorandum of Understanding ab, in dem vereinbart wurde, dass die Army einen Prototyp des Leopard 2 testen sollte. Das Ziel war, eine größtmögliche Standardisierung zwischen beiden Fahrzeugen zu erzielen. FMC bekundete Interesse daran, den Leopard 2 für die US Army zu fertigen. Die Wahl der Panzerung stand ebenfalls zur Debatte. Anfang 1974 schlugen die USA eine Änderung des Leopard-Designs vor, um die \\"Burlington\\"-Verbundpanzerung zu übernehmen, über deren Existenz die Bundesrepublik bereits im März 1970 informiert worden war, da die Leopard-Prototypen noch mit einer perforierten Panzerung ausgerüstet wurden. Die US Army stand im Sommer 1974 vor der Wahl, die deutsche Panzerung zu übernehmen oder an ihrer \\"Burlington\\" festzuhalten, welche jedoch verglichen mit Panzerstahl keinen Gewichtsvorteil gegenüber Wuchtgeschossen bot. Da sich kein Konsens entwickelte, entschied sich General Creighton Abrams für die Verwendung der \\"Burlington\\". Diese wurde vom Ballistic Research Laboratory zur „Chobham-Panzerung“ weiterentwickelt, welche speziell auf die Bedürfnisse des XM1 zugeschnitten wurde. Auf deutscher Seite wurde daraufhin 1974 eine eigene Verbundpanzerung entwickelt. Im Rahmen des Memorandum of Understanding sollte auch der Leopard2 hinsichtlich seiner Eignung als neuer Kampfpanzer getestet werden. Während der Tests zeigte sich, dass dieses Fahrzeug alle Forderungen der Army erfüllte oder übertraf. Aufgrund des höheren Gewichts und des höheren Preises erfolgte jedoch keine Übernahme des Leopard2 als Kampfpanzer. Stattdessen sollten möglichst viele Baugruppen der beiden Panzer identisch sein. Wesentliche Änderungen waren am Leopard2 der Einbau des in Lizenz gefertigten Laserentfernungsmessers der US-amerikanischen Firma Hughes, der gegenüber dem EMES13 billiger und serienreif war, sowie die Verwendung des WBG-Grundgerätes von Texas Instruments für das Wärmebildgerät WBG-X von Zeiss. Der XM1 übernahm die Gleisketten des Leopard2 und sollte langfristig mit der Rheinmetall 120-mm-Glattrohrkanone ausgerüstet werden. Der Technologietransfer dazu begann 1979., Bei der Entwicklung der ersten Prototypen sahen sich Chrysler und General Motors aufgrund des gestiegenen Gewichts gegenüber dem M60 und den höheren Anforderungen an Höchstgeschwindigkeit und Beschleunigungsvermögen mit der Herausforderung konfrontiert, einen Motor zu entwickeln, der mindestens die doppelte Leistung des alten M60-Triebwerks erbrachte. Chrysler verwendete eine modifizierte Helikopter-Gasturbine, während General Motors einen konventionelleren Weg beschritt und einen neuen Dieselmotor mit variabler Kompression entwickelte. Die Versuche mit den Prototypen waren im Februar 1976 abgeschlossen. Die Fahrzeuge beider Unternehmen erfüllten alle Anforderungen und hatten ihre jeweiligen Stärken und Schwächen in unterschiedlichen Bereichen. Im Juli wurde mit der britischen Regierung vereinbart, dass die bereits im M60 genutzte 105-mm-Kanone verwendet werden sollte. Dabei wurde festgehalten, dass das langfristige Ziel der Entwicklung die Ausrüstung mit einer 120-mm-Kanone war. Nach dieser ersten Testreihe sollte die Auswahl für eines der beiden Modelle erfolgen; Verteidigungsminister Donald Rumsfeld drängte jedoch darauf, dass bereits der Prototyp mit einer 120-mm-Kanone ausgerüstet werden sollte. Trotz der Proteste seitens der Army, die eine Einstellung des Projekts aufgrund der absehbaren Verzögerungen fürchtete, begannen beide Unternehmen, ihre Entwürfe entsprechend zu ändern. Die Türme wurden modifiziert, um sowohl die 105-mm-Kanone als auch die 120-mm-Kanone aufnehmen zu können. Letztendlich erfolgte die Bewaffnung mit der 105-mm-Kanone M68. Der Grund für die Ausstattung des Panzers mit der leistungsmäßig unterlegenen Waffe war, dass eine bewährte Kanone verwendet werden sollte. Den Zuschlag für die Produktion bekam Chrysler, da das Angebot für die Serienproduktion 36 Millionen Dollar unter dem Angebot von General Motors lag., Die als \\"Engineering and Manufacturing Development\\" bezeichnete Phase 2 des Entwicklungsprogramms begann im November 1976. Während dieser Phase baute Chrysler elf Vorserienexemplare, die einem intensiven Testprogramm unterzogen wurden. Gleichzeitig wurde, zusätzlich zur bereits vorhandenen Fabrik in Detroit, mit Lima Army Tank Plant eine weitere Fertigungsstätte für Panzer in Lima (Ohio) errichtet. Auf diese Weise sollten bis zu 60 Panzer im Monat hergestellt werden können.

Sie wurde vom deutschen Unternehmen Rheinmetall entwickelt und wird von dessen Tochtergesellschaft \\"Rheinmetall Waffe Munition\\", das zur Division \\"Weapon and Ammunition\\" gehört, produziert. Lizenzen für die Produktion wurden international an mehrere Unternehmen vergeben., Die Kanone ist die erste moderne Glattrohrkanone, die in der westlichen Welt nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg entwickelt wurde. Zunächst als Hauptbewaffnung des deutschen Leopard 2 eingeführt und später im US-amerikanischen M1 Abrams sowie weiteren Panzertypen verwendet, ist sie heute in den Panzern der Armeen vieler Länder im Einsatz. Bisher wird sie in drei Varianten, der \\"L/44\\", der \\"L/55\\" und der \\"L/55A1\\", verbaut. Die Entwicklung einer dritten Variante, der \\"LLR L/47\\" für luftverlastbare Fahrzeuge, ist abgeschlossen, sie wird aber bisher noch in keinem Waffensystem eingesetzt., Hintergrund., Mit der Verschärfung des Kalten Krieges und dem Auftauchen neuer Kampfpanzer auf Seiten des Warschauer Paktes wuchsen Mitte der 1960er-Jahre auf Seiten der Bundeswehr Zweifel, ob die existierenden Kanonen, insbesondere die weit verbreitete gezogene 105-mm-Kanone Royal Ordnance L7, noch in der Lage wären, diese neuen Gegner erfolgreich zu bekämpfen. Diese Gegner waren insbesondere die T-64- und T-72-Panzer, die mit einer damals neuartigen Verbundpanzerung und 125-mm-Glattrohrkanonen ausgerüstet waren., Die von den USA und Deutschland gemeinsam begonnene Entwicklung des Kampfpanzer 70 scheiterte und wurde 1969 eingestellt. Nachdem sich auch die geplante 152-mm-Kanone, die die Rohrrakete MGM-51 abfeuern konnte, für Deutschland als der falsche Weg herausstellte, entschloss sich Rheinmetall, einen neuen Weg bei der Entwicklung der Kanone einzuschlagen, der in der Sowjetunion bereits 1962 durch die Einführung der 115-mm-Glattrohrkanone U-5TS beim T-62 vorgezeichnet wurde., Entwicklung und Aufbau., 120-mm-Glattrohrkanone L/44., Die 120-mm-Glattrohrkanone \\"L/44\\" entstand in enger Zusammenarbeit mit der Bundeswehr speziell für den Einsatz im Leopard2, der damals entwickelt wurde. Die Forschungs- und Entwicklungsarbeit bei Rheinmetall begann im Jahr 1965 unter der Federführung von Raimund Germershausen und zog sich über zehn Jahre hin. Rheinmetall konnte bereits nach zweijähriger Entwicklungszeit nachweisen, dass die Glattrohrkanone flügelstabilisierte Geschosse mit großer Präzision verschießen konnte., Als die Kanone 1975 fertig war, wurde von Rheinmetall und den Fahrzeugherstellern in einem trinationalen Vergleichsschießen gezeigt, dass sie ihren westlichen Wettbewerbern mit gezogenen Läufen, nämlich der US-amerikanischen 105-mm- und der britischen 110-mm-Kanone, überlegen war. So lag die ballistische Leistung 60% über der der 105-mm-Kanone. Mit dem Zulauf des Leopard2 zur Truppe war so eine im Westen vollkommen neue Waffentechnik verfügbar., Der erste Lizenznehmer der \\"L/44\\"-Kanone, General Dynamics, führte sie 1986 als \\"M256\\" bei der \\"A1\\"-Version des M1 Abrams ein. Sie ersetzte dort die gezogene 105-mm-Kanone \\"M68A1\\". Die \\"L/44\\" ist zur Nachrüstung und damit Kampfwertsteigerung von Leopard 1 geeignet, die ebenfalls mit einer gezogenen 105-mm-Kanone \\"(L7A3)\\" ausgestattet sind., Die Kanone hat ein Kaliber von 120Millimetern. Die namensgebende Kaliberlänge44 ergibt damit eine Rohrlänge von 5280mm, was annähernd der Länge der \\"L7A3\\" des Leopard 1 entspricht. Das Rohr wiegt dabei 1190Kilogramm und die komplette Waffenanlage 3780Kilogramm., Das kaltgereckte Vollrohr ist für einen Konstruktionsgasdruck von 7100bar ausgelegt und erhielt eine Autofrettage. Als Werkstoff wurde ein hochfester, vakuum-umgeschmolzener Stahl verwendet. Im Vergleich zur L7A3-Kanone wurde die Dehngrenze des Stahls um mehr als 20Prozent auf 1,03 Gigapascal erhöht. Aufgrund der hohen Leistung der Munition und der damit einhergehenden hohen thermischen und erosiven Belastung ist das Rohr zur Erhöhung der Haltbarkeit innen hartverchromt. Anfängliche Probleme mit dieser Hartverchromung verzögerten die Entwicklung der Kanone., Um eine Verformung durch Sonneneinstrahlung möglichst gering zu halten, besitzt das Rohr eine Rohrschutzhülle aus doppelwandigem und ausgeschäumtem glasfaserverstärktem Kunststoff (GFK). GFK wurde hier erstmalig im Waffenbau verwendet und wurde auch gewählt, um durch die geringe Masse die Dynamik der Waffenanlage möglichst wenig zu beeinträchtigen. Der Rauchabsauger ist ebenfalls aus GFK gefertigt., Die Kanone ist auf Schildzapfen gelagert; der Höhenrichtbereich beträgt beim Einbau im Leopard2 minus 9Grad bis plus 20Grad. Der Verschluss der Kanone ist ein Fallkeilverschluss mit vorgesteuerter Öffner- und Auswerfermechanik. Das Schließen übernimmt eine Schließfeder. Beim Ausfall der Systeme kann der Verschluss auch von Hand geöffnet oder verschlossen werden. Die Waffe wird elektrisch abgefeuert. Eine Notabfeuerung mittels induktivem Stoßgenerator ist möglich. Die Rücklaufeinrichtung des Rohres besteht aus zwei hydraulischen Rohrbremsen mit einer Bremshöchstkraft von 600Kilonewton (kN). Der Rücklaufweg des Rohres ist mit nominal 340mm (maximal 370mm) annähernd äquivalent zur gezogenen 105-mm-Kanone mit 280mm. Der Rohrvorholer arbeitet mit einem hydropneumatischen System. Das Bodenstück ist mit der Rücklaufeinrichtung fest verbunden und mit einem Bajonettgewinde mit dem Rohr verschraubt. Aufgrund dieser Bauweise kann das Rohr in etwa 30 Minuten gewechselt werden. Die Kanone ist weder mit einer Mündungsbremse noch mit einem Mündungsfeuerdämpfer ausgerüstet., Waffenanlage und Munition., Die Kanone ist Bestandteil einer vollstabilisierten Waffenanlage. Als Entwicklungsziel wurde eine Waffenanlage mit Kanone mit größerem Kaliber als 105mm, die unter weitestgehender Beibehaltung der Abmessungen leistungsfähiger und zielgenauer sein sollte, formuliert., Die Entwicklungsvorgaben dieser Waffenanlage waren eine große effektive Kampfentfernung, eine hohe Trefferwahrscheinlichkeit beim ersten Schuss und eine gute Durchschlagsleistung auch gegen moderne Verbund- oder Reaktivpanzerungen. Die Kosten der gesamten Waffenanlage lagen laut ursprünglicher Preisaufstellung bei rund siebenProzent der Gesamtkosten des Leopard 2., Der Feldjustierkollimator aus den Vorserienfahrzeugen des Leopard2 entfiel bis 1991 in der Serienproduktion. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt wurde ein deutlich verbesserter Feldjustierspiegel eingebaut und an allen Glattrohrkanonen nachgerüstet., Da die Munition, die parallel zur Waffenanlage von Rheinmetall mitentwickelt wurde, nicht den stabilisierenden Drall eines Laufes mit Zügen und Feldern erhält, wird sie über ein Leitwerk aus Aluminium (bei neueren Munitionsarten aus Stahl) stabilisiert. Die Mündungsgeschwindigkeit beträgt mit Wuchtgeschossen, beispielsweise der \\"DM33\\", bis zu 1640Meter pro Sekunde (m/s). Die Mündungsenergie dieses Geschosses liegt damit bei rund 9,8 Megajoule (MJ). Die Lebensdauer des Rohres wurde ursprünglich mit 500 „Standardschuss“ spezifiziert. Durch die Verwendung anderer Munitionssorten, höherer Gasdrücke und abrasiverer Treibladungen sinkt die Lebensdauer allerdings auf unter 300 Schuss., 120-mm-Glattrohrkanone L/55., Durch die Weiterentwicklung des internationalen Panzerbaus mit der Einführung wirkungsvollerer Reaktivpanzerungen in den 1980er-Jahren und die Entwicklung von rohrverschießbaren Lenkwaffen mit einer Reichweite von bis zu fünfKilometern wurde eine Verbesserung der Feuerkraft aus Sicht der Bundeswehr unumgänglich. Nachdem die Entwicklung von Rheinmetall für eine noch leistungsfähigere 140-mm-Glattrohrkanone, der sogenannten \\"NPzK-140\\", insbesondere auf Grund der Tatsache, dass die Panzertürme hätten ersetzt werden müssen, keine Aussicht auf eine Serienreife hatte, wurde entschieden, die L/44 weiterzuentwickeln., Die Weiterentwicklung der L/44 wurde die \\"L/55\\". Sie ist nicht nur um 25Prozent länger und ermöglicht eine noch höhere Mündungsgeschwindigkeit, sondern brachte auch andere Weiterentwicklungen mit sich. Die L/55 ist so konstruiert, dass sie gemäß dem \\"Interface Control Document\\" (ICD) eine identische Geometrie der Kammer aufweist wie die L/44 und mindestens für die gleichen Gasdrücke geeignet ist. Damit kann Munition der L/44 auch in der L/55 verwendet werden. Außerdem war ein Entwicklungsziel, dass die neue Kanone ohne große Änderungen in den Serienturm des Leopard2 nachgerüstet werden kann. Im Jahr 1998 war sie schließlich für den Einsatz verfügbar, nachdem Rheinmetall 1997 die Erprobung zusammen mit der \\"DM-53\\"-Munition (auch \\"LKEII\\" genannt) abgeschlossen hatte. Die Rohre sind ausschließlich Neufertigungen; eine Verlängerung der L/44-Rohre ist nicht möglich. Die Nebeneffekte der Kopflastigkeit, das ungünstigere Fahrverhalten im Gelände und bebauten Gebieten sowie die häufiger notwendige Überprüfung der Justierung mit der Feldjustieranlage wurden als vertretbar eingestuft., Die L/55 ist für größere Gasdrücke ausgelegt, ermöglicht dadurch eine noch höhere Mündungsgeschwindigkeit und damit Durchschlagsfähigkeit der Geschosse. Außerdem wurden die Außengeometrie (Wandstärke) des Rohres sowie die Fertigungsabläufe optimiert, um das sonst ungünstige Schwingungsverhalten der Waffe bei der Schussabgabe zu verbessern. So erhält auch der hintere Teil der L/55 nun eine zweistufige Autofrettage. Auf eine Hartverchromung der Laufverlängerung im Mündungsbereich wird aufgrund der Erkenntnisse über die beim Schuss entstehenden und die Lebensdauer der Verchromung beeinträchtigenden Transversalwellen verzichtet. Für die L/55 wurde auch die Feldjustieranlage weiterentwickelt, die durch eine Änderung des Feldjustierspiegels an der Rohrmündung einen besseren Schwingungsausgleich bietet. Mit der Feldjustieranlage kann der Richtschütze die Justierung der Waffenanlage überprüfen und die aktuelle Verbiegung des Waffenrohres ermitteln und so die Justierung der Richtanlage korrigieren., Angepasst wurden ebenfalls die Bremskraft der Rohr-Rücklaufbremse von 600kN auf 900kN, die Schildzapfenlagerung: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Geschütz Kaliber, Kampfwagenkanone, Rheinmetall, 120-mm-Glattrohrkanone, Bundeswehr, Leopard 2, Panzertypen, Entwicklung, Munition, Waffenanlage"},{"prompt":"write a short speech about my major physics","completion":"Ladies and gentlemen, Today, I stand before you to share my passion for the incredible field of physics.

Es wurde am 5. September 1977 aufgenommen und am 17. November desselben Jahres auf Brels letzter Langspielplatte bei Disques Barclay veröffentlicht. Das Album des nach langer künstlerischer Pause aus der Südsee zurückgekehrten Chansonniers wurde ein öffentliches Ereignis in Frankreich. \\"Orly\\" gilt als eines der herausragenden Chansons auf Brels letzter Veröffentlichung., Das Lied handelt von einem Liebespaar, das sich auf dem Flughafen Paris-Orly voneinander verabschiedet. Ungewöhnlich für Brels Œuvre ist die Beobachterrolle, die der Erzähler einnimmt, und der nicht vorrangig männliche Blickwinkel, der sich am Ende auf die verlassene Frau richtet. \\"Orly\\" lässt sich nicht nur als trauriges Liebeslied, sondern mit seinen Anspielungen auf Krankheit und Tod auch als Abschied des todkranken Chansonniers vom Leben interpretieren. Im Refrain zieht Brel das Fazit, dass das Leben keine Geschenke verteile. Mit der Namensnennung seines Kollegen Gilbert Bécaud verweist er auf dessen ungleich optimistischeres Chanson \\"Dimanche à Orly\\" über Fernweh am Flughafen., Text und Musik., Sonntags in Orly: Über zweitausend Menschen strömen durch den Flughafen, doch der Erzähler hat nur Augen für zwei, ein Liebespaar, das im Regen steht und sich so fest umarmt, dass die Körper verschmelzen. Unter Tränen beteuern sie ihre Liebe, doch machen sie einander keine Versprechungen, die sie nicht halten können. Schließlich trennen sich ihre Körper ganz langsam, halten sich wieder, bis sich der Mann abrupt abwendet und von einer Treppe verschluckt wird. Zurück bleibt die Frau, mit offenem Mund, schlagartig gealtert, als sei sie ihrem Tod begegnet. In der Vergangenheit hat sie schon öfter Männer verloren, doch dieses Mal ist es die Liebe, die sie verloren hat. Sie fühlt sich zerbrechlich, wie zum Verkauf bestimmt. Der Erzähler versucht ihr zu folgen, doch dann wird auch sie von der Menge verschluckt., Der Refrain lautet:, Was sich etwa übersetzen lässt als: „Das Leben macht keine Geschenke. Und in Gottes Namen (auch stärker: Verdammt nochmal), es ist traurig sonntags in Orly, ob mit oder ohne Bécaud.“, Die Verse nehmen sich einige Freiheiten bezüglich der Reime, befolgen aber streng das Versmaß von halben Alexandrinern. Die Melodie ist ausgesprochen monoton. Sie beginnt mit dem Wechsel zweier einfacher Akkorde auf einer sanft angeschlagenen Gitarre, die laut Hubert Thébault die Wirkung eines Herzschlags erzeugt. Es handelt sich um Tonika und Dominantseptakkord in c-Moll zur ersten und dritten Viertelnote eines Drei-Viertel-Takts. Während sich Brel so die erste Strophe hindurch alleine begleitet, setzt das von seinem langjährigen Arrangeur François Rauber geleitete Orchester erst nach dem ersten Refrain explosionsartig ein. Die vier akzentuierten Einsätze wirken dabei „wie ein akustisches Ausrufezeichen“. Ab der zweiten Strophe geben die Streicher den Rhythmus vor, während die Bläser in der dritten Strophe das für Brel charakteristische Crescendo unterstützen. Ulf Kubanke spricht von einem „verweht hallenden Bläserecho“, Hubert Thébault erinnern die Fanfaren der Trompeten an eine Corrida. Wie es für die Zusammenarbeit von Brel und Rauber typisch war, hatte Brel von Beginn an genaue Vorstellungen zum musikalischen Stil und der Instrumentierung, so etwa auch zur Trompetenstimme, ließ Rauber dann jedoch die Details ausarbeiten., Hintergrund und Entstehungsgeschichte., Im Mai 1967 gab Brel mit gerade einmal 38 Jahren seine Abschiedsvorstellung als Chansonnier auf der Bühne. Im Folgejahr erschien eine letzte Langspielplatte, anschließend trat Brel nur noch in einem Musical und verschiedenen Filmen auf. Im November 1974 musste sich der an Lungenkrebs erkrankte Sänger einer Operation unterziehen, bei der ein Teil seiner Lunge entfernt wurde. Noch im Dezember des Jahres brach er mit seiner Geliebten Maddly Bamy zu einer Atlantiküberquerung per Segelschiff auf. Wenige Wochen zuvor hatte er sich von einer anderen Geliebten namens Monique verabschiedet, die er niemals wiedersah. Eddy Przybylski vermutet diese Trennung auf einem Flughafen (nicht in Orly, doch mit dem Pariser Flughafen als Reiseziel) als biografischen Hintergrund des Chansons \\"Orly\\". Brels Reise führte ihn über mehrere Zwischenstationen auf die Marquesas-Inseln, wo er sich im Juni 1976 auf Hiva Oa dauerhaft niederließ. Auf der Insel, auf der schon Paul Gauguin seine letzten Jahre verbracht hatte, fand Brel noch einmal die Inspiration für siebzehn neue Chansons über „ein paar Dinge, die mir seit fünfzehn Jahren durch den Kopf gehen“., Im August 1977 überraschte Brel seine alten Weggefährten mit einer kurzfristigen Rückkehr nach Paris. Vor der französischen Öffentlichkeit, in der Gerüchte über den sterbenskranken Chansonnier kursierten, versteckte er sich in einem kleinen Hotel nahe der Place de l’Étoile. Im Gepäck hatte er eine Kassette mit Probeaufnahmen seiner neuen Chansons. Gérard Jouannest kritisierte die Monotonie der Melodien, doch François Rauber schmückte sie mit seinen Arrangements aus. Für die Plattenaufnahmen hatte Eddie Barclay ein Studio in der Avenue Hoche angemietet. Brel nahm die Lieder gemeinsam mit einem von Rauber geleiteten Orchester auf, jedoch nie mehr als zwei Chansons pro Arbeitssitzung, die in wenigen Takes abgeschlossen sein mussten. Brels Stimme hatte nachgelassen, er konnte höchstens drei Stunden am Stück singen, bevor er eine Pause machen musste. Die angespannte Stimmung im voll besetzten Studio versuchte er mit Witzen über seinen fehlenden Lungenflügel aufzulockern. \\"Orly\\" gehörte mit \\"Jojo\\" zu den ersten beiden Chansons, die Brel am 5. September aufnahm., Als Brels letzte Platte am 17. November 1977 veröffentlicht wurde, löste dies ein enormes Echo in der Öffentlichkeit aus. Die Platte trug keinen Titel, das Cover zeigte nur die vier Buchstaben seines Nachnamens vor einem blauen Wolkenhimmel. Barclay machte keine herkömmliche Werbung, sorgte jedoch gerade mit einer demonstrativen Geheimhaltung, der Auslieferung verschlossener Container samt zeitgleicher Öffnung der Zahlenschlösser, für einen besonderen Werbecoup, der die Erwartungen in die Höhe schnellen ließ und für 1 Million Vorbestellungen sorgte. Brel, der Paris bereits Richtung Südsee verlassen hatte, war verärgert über den Rummel. Er lebte noch ein gutes halbes Jahr in Hiva Oa, bis sich sein Gesundheitszustand so weit verschlechtert hatte, dass er im Juli 1978 erneut nach Paris zurückkehren musste, dieses Mal für eine Chemotherapie. Drei Monate später starb er am 9. Oktober 1978 in Bobigny bei Paris an Herzversagen., Interpretation., Liebe und Trennung., Laut Maddly Bamy beschrieb Brel \\"Orly\\" als „une belle chanson d’amour“ („ein schönes Liebeslied“). Für Sara Poole steht es in einer Reihe mit Chansons wie \\"Ne me quitte pas\\" oder \\"Madeleine\\", die kraftvoll und dramatisch die Verzweiflung und das Ausgeliefertsein an tiefe Leidenschaften heraufbeschwören. Monique Watrin erinnert die „Mini-Tragödie“ \\"Orly\\" an den frühen, leidenschaftlichen Brel aus dem Jahr 1959, dem Jahr also, in dem er mit \\"Ne me quitte pas\\" das „Liebeslied des Jahrhunderts“ (laut Frédéric Brun) geschrieben hat. Aus Sicht seines Chanson-Kollegen Serge Lama hat Brel überhaupt nur vier wirkliche Liebeslieder geschrieben: \\"Ne me quitte pas\\", \\"La chanson des vieux amants\\", \\"Orly\\" und \\"Jojo\\". Für Anne Bauer ist \\"Orly\\" gar das „einzige Chanson von Brel, in dem es eine Liebe ohne Vorbehalte, ohne Hintergedanken und ohne Lüge gibt“., \\"Orly\\" beschreibt die schmerzliche Trennung eines Paares, das sich zwar liebt, aber wegen nicht ausgeführter Umstände nicht zusammenbleiben kann. Anders als in Chansons wie \\"Je ne sais pas\\" (1958) oder \\"La Colombe\\" (1959) vollzieht sich die Trennung nicht auf einem Bahnsteig, sondern inmitten der Menschenmenge auf einem betriebsamen Flughafen. Und ebenfalls anders als bei früheren Chansons hält sich Brel vollkommen aus dem Geschehen heraus und beschränkt sich darauf, zu beschreiben, was er sieht. Dabei bedient er sich quasi-filmischer Stilmittel und richtet das Objektiv abwechselnd auf das Paar als Ganzes und die einzelnen Personen, ihr Verhalten, ihre Gesten, ihre Blicke und ihre Tränen, mit denen er ein desillusioniertes Bild der menschlichen Existenz zeichnet. Als eine Art Leitmotiv dienen die einleitenden Zeilen „Ils sont plus de deux mille / Et je ne vois queux deux“ („Sie sind über zweitausend und ich sehe nur sie beide“), die im Verlauf der ersten beiden Strophen zweimal wiederholt werden. Sie dienen der Fokussierung, richten den Blick des Erzählers vom Allgemeinen auf das Besondere., Zu Beginn zeigt Brel das Paar als Einheit mit Ausdrücken wie „eux deux“, „ces deux“, „tous les deux“ und „ils“ („sie beide“, „diese beiden“ „alle beide“ und „sie“). Er erweckt im Zuhörer das Bild einer sehr engen, innigen Vereinigung. Diese wird noch verstärkt durch die äußeren Umstände, den Regen, der beide einhüllt und sich in ihren Tränen widerspiegelt, sowie das gemeinsame Feuer, das in beiden brennt. Bei den ersten, widerstrebenden Versuchen der Trennung erinnert die aufeinander bezogene Bewegung der beiden Körper an Naturelemente, an Ebbe und Flut. Das Paar hebt sich von der umgebenden Menschenmenge ab, nicht nur durch den Fokus des Betrachters, sondern auch indem es eine Liebe lebt, die den anderen unverständlich bleibt, von ihnen verurteilt wird. Es ist eine Liebe, die um ihre Begrenzungen weiß, die keine falschen Versprechungen braucht und durch das Hindernis zwischen den Liebenden noch wächst., Mit der Trennung des Paares treten die Einzelwesen hervor. Beide bewältigen den Schmerz auf ihre eigene Art und Weise, die für Watrin typische Geschlechterrollen transportiert. Zuerst wird der Mann als eigenständige Person erkennbar. Hierbei arbeitet Brel mit einer Syllepse, bei der erst im Rückbezug korrigiert wird, dass es alleine der Mann gewesen ist, der seinen Schmerz in „gros bouillons“ („dicker Brühe“) herausweint. Diese Kombination der Redewendungen „bouillir à gros bouillons“ („schnell kochen“) und „pleurer à chaudes larmes“ („sich die Augen ausweinen“), assozii: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Chanson, Jacques Brel, Lied, Orly, Liebespaar, Verabschiedung, traurig, Krankheit, Tod, Jacques B."},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Kettenfahrzeug, Schützenpanzer, Spähpanzer, US-amerikanisches Militärfahrzeug], Der M2 Bradley IFV (, wörtlich übersetzt: Infanterie-Kampffahrzeug) ist ein Schützenpanzer der US Army, der in den 1970er Jahren von der Food Machinery Corporation entwickelt und ab 1981 an die Streitkräfte ausgeliefert wurde. Der technisch fast identische M3 Bradley CFV (\\"Cavalry Fighting Vehicle\\", ) wird als Spähpanzer eingesetzt. Der Panzer ist nach dem US-amerikanischen General Omar N. Bradley benannt. Der Bradley wird außer von den USA auch von den Streitkräften Saudi-Arabiens, Kroatiens, der Ukraine und des Libanons verwendet. Seit der Indienststellung der ersten Exemplare im Mai 1981 wurden insgesamt 6785 Exemplare hergestellt, was den Bradley zu einem der meistgebauten Schützenpanzer der Welt macht. Die Modelle wurden mehreren Kampfwertsteigerungen unterzogen, um sie technisch auf dem neuesten Stand zu halten und sie der geänderten Bedrohungslage des 21.Jahrhunderts anzupassen., Geschichte., Ausgangssituation., Die US Army nutzte zu Beginn der 1960er Jahre den M113, um Infanterie unter Schutz vor Splittern, Schrapnellen und Handwaffen auf dem Gefechtsfeld zu befördern. Dieses Modell erlaubte den im hinteren Raum des Panzers untergebrachten Infanteristen weder die Beobachtung des Gefechtsfelds noch den Einsatz ihrer Handwaffen, sodass sie vom Geschehen außerhalb des Fahrzeugs abgeschnitten waren. Im Gefecht der verbundenen Waffen bot die Aluminiumpanzerung zunehmend unzureichenden Schutz gegen Panzerabwehrwaffen, Kampfpanzer und Panzerabwehrminen., Weiterhin erwarteten US-amerikanische Militärplanungen für einen eventuellen Konflikt mit der Sowjetunion in Mitteleuropa den Einsatz von Massenvernichtungswaffen. Mangels ABC-Schutzanlage bot der M113 seiner Besatzung, insbesondere dem in der geöffneten Dachluke am Maschinengewehr stehenden Schützen, nur durch ihre persönliche ABC-Schutzausstattung Schutz. Alle diese Faktoren setzten die Infanteristen im Heck des Fahrzeugs, die sich dieser Mängel bewusst waren, einem erheblichen psychischen Druck aus. Zuletzt war bereits absehbar, dass die Geschwindigkeit des M113 nicht ausreichen würde, um mit dem in der Entwicklung befindlichen Kampfpanzer 70 mitzuhalten., Aufgrund dieser Probleme wurde 1964 das \\"Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle\\"-Programm (MICV) ins Leben gerufen, um ein Fahrzeug zu entwickeln, das beweglicher, besser gepanzert und besser bewaffnet sein sollte als der M113, um das Gefecht der verbundenen Waffen mit dem neuen Kampfpanzer führen zu können. Gleichzeitig sollten die Infanteristen im Heck ihre Handwaffen vom Fahrzeug aus einsetzen und das Gefechtsfeld beobachten können, auch um den psychischen Druck zu verringern. Da die Entwicklung eines neuen Fahrzeugs, des MICV-70, voraussichtlich zehn Jahre in Anspruch genommen hätte, sollte eine Zwischenlösung auf Basis bereits bestehender Fahrzeuge eingeführt werden. Diese Zwischenlösung trug den Namen XM701 bzw. MICV-65 und verwendete im Bereich der Wanne Komponenten der Selbstfahrlafetten M107 und M110. 1966 wurde das Programm aufgrund von Budgetkürzungen (Mittel wurden in das Vietnamkriegsbudget transferiert) und einigen Mängeln wieder eingestellt. Die drei Hauptmängel dabei waren die schlechte Beweglichkeit im Gelände, das hohe Gewicht und die Breite der Wanne. Aufgrund der Größe und des Gewichts konnte das Fahrzeug weder in der C-130 Hercules noch in der C-141 Starlifter transportiert werden, was eine schnelle Verlegung in Kriegsgebiete verhinderte. Forschung und Entwicklung wurden fortgesetzt, nachdem Versuche mit dem Prototyp ergeben hatten, dass das Grundkonzept des Fahrzeugs sinnvoll war. Das MICV-70-Programm wurde daraufhin in XM723 umbenannt. Der Forderungskatalog für das Fahrzeug sah vor, dass die Vorteile des XM701 in ein für die Army akzeptables Gesamtkonzept integriert werden sollten. Eine Studie sah als brauchbarstes Design ein Kettenfahrzeug mit Aluminiumpanzerung mit 12 Soldaten als Besatzung und einer 20-mm-Kanone als Bewaffnung vor., Der XM723., Der Vietnamkrieg bestärkte die Army von der Notwendigkeit eines neuen Schützenpanzers. Während der Kämpfe gegen den Vietcong war noch deutlicher geworden, dass die Soldaten die Möglichkeit haben mussten, ihre Handwaffen vom Fahrzeug aus einzusetzen, da Angriffe der Infanteristen ohne den Schutz der Panzerung des Fahrzeugs oft mit hohen Verlusten endeten. Der US Army war klar geworden, dass ein Schützenpanzer mit besserer Bewaffnung, besserer Panzerung sowie der Möglichkeit für die Infanteristen, vom Innenraum des Fahrzeugs aus zu kämpfen, dringend gebraucht wurde. Mit dem Aufkommen einer neuen Schützenpanzergeneration Ende der 1960er Jahre kam noch hinzu, dass der M113 neuen Modellen wie dem Marder oder dem BMP-1 technisch und taktisch unterlegen war. Die Food Machinery Corporation (FMC) bekam deshalb 1967 den Auftrag, einen Schützenpanzer auf Basis des M113 zu entwickeln. Dieser Prototyp mit der Bezeichnung XM765 wies äußerlich eine hohe Ähnlichkeit mit dem M113 auf. Die Army erprobte dieses Fahrzeug, während sie gleichzeitig die Nutzung des Marder in Betracht zog. Letztendlich nahm sie von beiden Modellen Abstand; das Modell XM765 erwies sich aufgrund seines zu geringen Schutzniveaus, der Marder aufgrund zu geringer Beweglichkeit, der nicht vorhandenen Schwimmfähigkeit und zu hoher Kosten als unzureichend. Da der XM765 jedoch zufriedenstellende Ansätze aufwies, sollten die Unternehmen Chrysler Corporation (heute General Dynamics Land Systems), FMC und Pacific Car and Foundry Vorschläge für ein neues Fahrzeug einreichen. Sie erhielten die Vorgabe, das neue Fahrzeug besser zu panzern, es auf eine höhere Geschwindigkeit hin zu motorisieren und es schwimmfähig zu gestalten. Weiterhin sollte die Bewaffnung aus einer 25-mm-Kanone in einem Ein-Mann-Turm bestehen und die Absitzstärke neun Soldaten betragen, die auch aus dem Inneren des Fahrzeugs heraus kämpfen können sollten. Die Panzerung sollte gegen Waffen vom Kaliber 23mm an der Front und gegen 14,5mm an den Seiten und am Heck Schutz bieten, sowie gegen Splitter von 155-mm-Artilleriegeschossen. Das Layout des Fahrzeugs lehnte sich stark an das des BMP-1 an. Die projektierten Stückkosten betrugen zu diesem Zeitpunkt 151.575 US-Dollar., Im November 1972 erhielt der Prototyp von FMC, der auf dem LVT7 basierte, den Zuschlag. Der erste Prototyp wurde bereits im Dezember fertiggestellt. Insgesamt sollten 16 Prototypen für Übungszwecke und Beschussversuche bereitgestellt werden. Das Fahrzeug konnte, abweichend von den Forderungen, nur acht Infanteristen mit Ausrüstung transportieren. Diese konnten ihre Handwaffen durch Schießluken von innen heraus einsetzen. Die Bewaffnung bestand aus der 20-mm-Maschinenkanone-M139 und einem koaxialen Maschinengewehr des Kalibers 7,62mm, die in einem kleinen Ein-Mann-Turm untergebracht waren. Die Maschinenkanone stellte lediglich eine Zwischenlösung dar; zur Wahl für die Serienproduktion standen zwei 25-mm-Kanonen der Firmen Ford Aerospace/Oerlikon und Hughes. Beide Waffen befanden sich jedoch noch in der Entwicklung. Dieser Prototyp des Fahrzeugs wies bereits eine hohe Ähnlichkeit mit der Serienversion des M2 auf., Während der Produktion der Prototypen begann die Army mit der Suche nach einem neuen Aufklärungsfahrzeug, das den M114 ersetzen sollte. Verschiedene erfolglose Projekte zur Entwicklung eines Nachfolgers waren eingestellt worden. Da nicht genügend Mittel für die Entwicklung und Produktion eines völlig neuen Fahrzeugs vorhanden waren und da der XM723 einige Aspekte beinhaltete, die dem Forderungskatalog für den Spähpanzer entsprachen, wurde der XM723 auch für die Rolle eines Spähpanzers ausgewählt. Da somit zwei Truppengattungen von dem Fahrzeug profitieren würden, gewann das Projekt an Wichtigkeit. Gleichzeitig stiegen aber auch die Anforderungen, da zwei unterschiedliche Einsatzprofile in einem Fahrzeug vereint werden mussten. Erste Planungen sahen vor, dass die Schützenpanzervariante den Ein-Mann-Turm beibehalten sollte, während die Spähpanzervariante einen Zwei-Mann-Turm nutzen sollte, um dem Kommandanten einen besseren Überblick zu ermöglichen. Gleichzeitig sollte die Wanne des Spähpanzers modifiziert werden, um eine umfangreiche Beobachtungs- und Kommunikationsausrüstung aufnehmen zu können. Da der Führung der Army jedoch schnell klar wurde, dass diese Änderungen die Kosten des Projekts stark erhöhen würden, verzichtete man auf diese Forderungen. Aufgrund dessen wurde, nach der Fertigstellung der Prototypen im August 1976, eine Untersuchungskommission unter der Leitung von General Richard Larkin damit beauftragt, das Projekt kritisch zu begutachten. Auf Grundlage dieser Begutachtung machte die Kommission der US Army folgende Vorschläge:, Die Umstellung auf einen größeren Turm war innerhalb der Army sehr umstritten, da die Absitzstärke aufgrund des erhöhten Platzbedarfs des Turms weiter verringert wurde und die Schwimmfähigkeit aufgrund des gestiegenen Gewichts nur durch einen zusätzlichen Schwimmkragen erhalten werden konnte. Die Vorteile durch den besseren Überblick für den Kommandanten gaben jedoch den Ausschlag für diese Variante. Insbesondere die Aufklärervariante des Fahrzeugs sollte davon profitieren. Die ebenfalls sehr umstrittene Entscheidung, das gleiche Fahrzeug für zwei verschiedene Aufgaben einzusetzen, fiel aufgrund taktischer Erwägungen: Die Verwendung des gleichen Fahrzeugs bei Aufklärern und mechanisierter Infanterie sollte es Feindkräften erschweren, den Unterschied zwischen Voraus- und Hauptkräften während eines Angriffs festzustellen., Kontroverse., FMC erhielt den Auftrag, das Design des Fahrzeugs den Forderungen entsprechend anzupassen. Im März 1977 wurde das Programm in XM2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle für die mechanisierte Infanterie und in XM3 Cavalry Fighting Vehicle für die Panzeraufklärer umbenannt. Die aufgrund der empfohlenen Änderungen auf 338.000 US-Dollar gestiegenen Stückkosten riefen zum gleichen Zeitpunkt den Kongress auf den Plan, der das gesamte Konzept des Fahrzeugs, das zu Beginn der 1960er Jahre entworfen wurde, in Frage stellte. Einige Senatoren hielten das Fahrzeug wegen seines relativ geringen Schutzniveaus für überflüssig. Ein schwereres Fahrzeug mit einem dem XM1, dem späteren M1 Abrams, vergleichbaren Schutzniveau sei eine modernere Alternative. Weiterhin wurde die Höhe des Fahrzeugs kritisiert: Mit 3,38m überragte es den: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Kettenfahrzeug, Schützenpanzer, Spähpanzer, US-amerikanisches Militärfahrzeug, M2 Bradley, Infanterie-Kampffahrzeug, Omar N.

Verhaftungen, Enteignungen, Exekutionen und Massendeportationen kennzeichneten diese Politik., Insbesondere als wohlhabend geltende bäuerliche Familien, aber auch so genannte Mittelbauern samt ihren Angehörigen sowie jene Landbewohner, welche die Politik der Kommunistischen Partei der Sowjetunion (KPdSU) tatsächlich oder vermeintlich ablehnten, waren Ziel der gewaltsamen Unterdrückung. Rund 30.000 Personen wurden erschossen. Etwa 2,1 Millionen Menschen wurden in entfernte, unwirtliche Regionen deportiert – 1,8 Millionen davon von 1930 bis 1931. Weitere 2 bis 2,5 Millionen Personen wurden in ihrer Heimatregion auf schlechtere Böden zwangsumgesiedelt. Experten schätzen, dass die Entkulakisierung durch Hunger, Krankheiten und Exekutionen 530.000 bis 600.000 Menschenleben kostete. Die Bauern reagierten insbesondere 1930 mit erheblichem Widerstand gegen die Gewaltkampagne des Staates. Zeitweise fürchteten Partei- und Staatsfunktionäre, der bäuerliche Widerstand könne sich zu einem landesweiten Aufstand ausweiten., Die Entkulakisierung bedrohte die Bauernschaft durch physische Vernichtung, Deportation und Enteignung. Auf diese Weise sollte sie der Zwangskollektivierung zum Durchbruch verhelfen. Im Ergebnis unterwarfen Entkulakisierung und Kollektivierung die gesamte Bauernschaft der staatlichen Kontrolle und trugen wesentlich dazu bei, die tradierte ländliche Sozialverfassung radikal zu verändern. Zugleich legte die Entkulakisierung den Grundstein für die Ausweitung des Gulag-Systems., Die Kombination von Entkulakisierung, Zwangskollektivierung und weiteren repressiven Maßnahmen führte in vielen Regionen der Sowjetunion, insbesondere in traditionellen agrarischen Überschussregionen, zum Zusammenbruch der Landwirtschaft. Dieser Kollaps war eine der Ursachen für den Holodomor, eine epochale Hungerkatastrophe mit etwa fünf bis sieben Millionen Toten in der Ukraine, und einer Hungersnot in anderen Teilen der Sowjetunion., Hintergrund und Vorgeschichte., Bauern und Bolschewiki., Die Oktoberrevolution 1917 legitimierte mit dem Dekret über Grund und Boden die von den Bauern in Eigenregie vorgenommene Enteignung von Staats- und Gutsbesitz, Kirchen- und Klosterländereien sowie die durch die Dorfgemeinschaft \\"Mir\\" () vorgenommene Aufteilung dieses Landes nach dem Subsistenzprinzip. Bis zum Ende des Bürgerkriegs (1921) bedeutete dies jedoch nicht die Befreiung von Krieg und Zwang, da die Bauern für Verbände der Roten Armee, der Weißen Truppen oder für bäuerliche Aufstandsarmeen (siehe beispielsweise Bauernaufstand von Tambow) rekrutiert wurden. Zugleich litten sie unter den umfangreichen Zwangsrequirierungen landwirtschaftlicher Erzeugnisse, welche die Bolschewiki zur Absicherung ihrer Macht vornahmen. Bürgerkrieg, roter und weißer Terror, Aufstände, Requirierungen und die Vernachlässigung landwirtschaftlicher Aufgaben führten in Stadt und Land zu einer Hungersnot, die 1921/22 rund 30 Millionen Menschen betraf und fünf Millionen Menschenleben kostete., Die Neue Ökonomische Politik (NEP) – „eine politische Hinhalteaktion für eine zukünftige ökonomische Revolution“ – läutete „eine ‚goldene Zeit‘ für Dorf und Landwirtschaft“ ein und beruhigte die Spannungen zwischen Bolschewiki und Bauern, ohne sie jedoch gänzlich beseitigen zu können. Die politischen Machthaber ersetzten die Praxis der Requirierungen durch Natural- und später durch Geldsteuern. Ferner gestanden sie die Re-Etablierung von Marktmechanismen bei der Allokation agrarischer Produkte zu; ebenso bremsten sie ihre Initiativen ab, die Wirtschaftsgüter der Bauern, die damals 85Prozent der Gesamtbevölkerung stellten, zu sozialisieren. Trotz ihrer anders gearteten ideologischen Vorstellungen waren die Bolschewiki gezwungen, die Ökonomie dieser Jahre halbstaatlich und halbkapitalistisch zu gestalten., Mit dem Abzug der bolschewistischen Requirierungskommandos und der Terroreinheiten der Tscheka aus den Dörfern zeigte sich, dass die Kommunisten außerhalb der Städte ohne jede Basis waren. Das Sowjetregime blieb für die Mehrheit der Bauern eine auswärtige und fremde Macht. Für die Parteifunktionäre wurde das Land eine gefährliche terra incognita mit einem Milieu, zu dem sie keinen Zugang hatten. Das „Dorf“ galt ihnen als Chiffre der Rückständigkeit, als Sinnbild des alten Russlands der „Ikonen und Kakerlaken“ (Trotzki). Eine Reihe führender Funktionäre hatte einen ausgeprägten Hass auf Bauern. Zu ihnen gehörten Josef Stalin, Lasar Kaganowitsch, Grigori Ordschonikidse, Anastas Mikojan, Kliment Woroschilow und Wjatscheslaw Molotow., Das Dorf selbst, häufig abgeschnitten von allen Kommunikationsmitteln und -wegen zur „Zivilisation“, war geprägt vom Gerücht, von Analphabetismus, von Glaube und Aberglaube, von Alkohol und Gewalt. Die Dorfgemeinschaft verwaltete sich selbst mit Hilfe der Dorfversammlung \\"(сход/s’chod)\\". Die von den Kommunisten geförderte Institution des Dorfsowjet blieb dagegen praktisch ohne Bedeutung. Die Revitalisierung der bäuerlichen Wirtschaftsweise durch die NEP konservierte auch die mit dieser Agrarökonomie einhergehenden Herrschaftsverhältnisse. All das hatte nichts zu tun mit dem, was die Bolschewiki für „Fortschritt“ hielten. Mental, politisch, kulturell und ökonomisch verweigerte sich die Mehrheit der Bauern der neuen Staatsmacht und urbanen Lebensformen. Die Bolschewiki misstrauten darum den Bauern und hielten sie für potentielle Restauratoren des Kapitalismus. Insbesondere \\"Kulaken\\" galten ihnen als Feinde., Struktur der Bauernschaft., In den Jahren der NEP nahm der Anteil der Landbewohner an der Gesamtbevölkerung ab. 1924 lebten 83,7 % aller Sowjetbürger im Dorf, 1930 waren es 80,7 %. Die absolute Zahl der Dorfbewohner stieg jedoch; auch nach Abzug der Landflucht blieb ein Zuwachs von 4,2 Millionen Menschen. Zugleich war die Dorfbevölkerung jung. Eine Zählung von 1926 zeigte, dass über 50 % der Dorfbewohner keine 20Jahre alt waren., Die marxistische Vorstellung von klar unterscheidbaren Klassen fand in den materiellen Verhältnissen auf dem Land keine Basis. Die Tradition der regelmäßigen Neuverteilung von Dorffeldern durch die russischen Dorfgemeinschaften an die Bauernhaushalte nach deren wechselndem Bedarf verhinderte eine Verstetigung der Besitzverhältnisse. Einzelgehöfte außerhalb der Dorfgemeinschaften, die erst seit den stolypinschen Agrarreformen existierten und zur Zeit der NEP zunahmen, fielen noch kaum ins Gewicht, ihre Bewohner waren zudem nicht immer wohlhabend. Dorfbewohner übernahmen im Jahreslauf mehrere ökonomische und soziale Rollen: Sie waren im Sommer Bauern, im Winter Wanderarbeiter oder im Heimgewerbe tätig, je nach Jahreszeit Wanderhändler oder Tagelöhner während der Ernte. Die soziale Differenzierung hatte sich nicht zu „Klassen“ verfestigt. Dennoch unterteilten die marxistischen Ökonomen und Statistiker der Sowjetunion mit ihrem weitgehenden Deutungsmonopol die Dorfbewohner in soziale Großgruppen:, Forcierte Industrialisierung., Mit dem Entschluss zur forcierten Industrialisierung der Sowjetunion hatte Stalin einen entscheidenden Markstein der „Großen Wende“ gesetzt. Seit Lenins Tod im Januar 1924 war nicht nur die linke Opposition in der KPdSU besiegt, auch die „Parteirechte“ um Nikolai Bucharin, die für ein gemäßigtes Tempo des Modernisierungsprozesses plädiert hatte, war ausgeschaltet. Im 1928 bewilligten ersten Fünfjahresplan (1928–1932) fanden die Vorstellungen einer rasanten Industrialisierung ihren Ausdruck, die den Anschluss an das wirtschaftliche und technologische Niveau der Industrieländer innerhalb nur eines Jahrzehnts sicherstellen sollte. Einen solch großen Entwicklungsschub hielt Stalin – wie er im Februar 1931 betonte – auch deswegen für zwingend geboten, weil die Nachbarländer seiner Ansicht nach auf die Zerstörung der Sowjetunion hinarbeiteten. Konsequenterweise stand der Aufbau der Schwerindustrie im Vordergrund, weniger die Entwicklung der Konsumgüterindustrie., Weil diese Industrialisierung weder durch Ausbeutung von Kolonien, noch durch die Aufnahme von Krediten im Ausland zu finanzieren sei, habe die Bauernschaft einen „Tribut“ zu entrichten, so Stalin. Mit Getreideausfuhren sollten die notwendigen Anlagen und Güter zum Aufbau der Industrie finanziert werden. Die Bauern selbst sollten für die bei ihnen akquirierten Agrarprodukte kein volles Äquivalent erhalten. Stalin machte damit die Bauernschaft quasi zu einer internen Kolonie, aus der das notwendige Kapital für die Wirtschaftsentwicklung herauszuziehen sei., Kollektivierung der Landwirtschaft., Der Entschluss zur forcierten Industrialisierung des Landes korrespondierte mit den verstärkten Bemühungen, die Landwirtschaft zu kollektivieren. Trotz erheblicher Propagandabemühungen und vielfältigen administrativen Drucks war die Kollektivierung bis Ende der 1920er Jahre kaum vorangekommen. 1926 existierten in der UdSSR nur 18.000 solcher genossenschaftlicher Zusammenschlüsse. Insbesondere jene Bauern, die nichts zu verlieren hatten, flüchteten sich in diese Kolchosen. Die staatlichen Sowchosen waren noch unbedeutender. 1929 belief sich der Anteil der Bauern, die auf ihr individuelles Eigentum verzichtet hatten, auf 7,6 %., Die Parteiführung um Stalin versprach sich von der Kollektivierung deutliche Steigerungen der landwirtschaftlichen Erträge. Zugleich hielt sie die traditionellen Formen der landwirtschaftlichen Ökonomie für veraltet, lehnte sie aus ideologischen Motiven ab und sah auch auf diesem Gebiet staatliche Planung und Lenkung vor. Die Parteikonferenz vom April 1929, die den ersten Fünfjahresplan beschloss, ging noch davon aus, dass Ende 1932 rund 23 % aller landwirtschaftlichen Betriebe kollektiviert sein würden. Wenige Monate später, anlässlich des zwölften Jahrestages der Oktoberrevolution, veröffentlichte Stalin einen Artikel mit dem Titel „Das Jahr des großen Umschwungs“. Er behauptete, die Mittelbauern träten in großen Massen in die Kollektivwirtschaften ein.

Классы могут наследоваться, что позволяет создавать иерархию объектов с общими свойствами и методами. Это дает возможность создавать более гибкую и поддерживаемую архитектуру. С другой стороны, интерфейсы также имеют преимущества: 1. Интерфейсы определяют только структуру объекта, без реализации. Это позволяет легко переопределять интерфейсы в разных частях кода и применять их к различным классам. 2. Интерфейсы могут быть реализованы несколькими классами одновременно. Это особенно полезно, если объекты имеют общие свойства и методы, но имеют различную функциональность. 3.

Dürer hatte das Nashorn selbst nie gesehen; der Holzschnitt basierte auf einer Beschreibung und der Skizze eines unbekannten Künstlers, der das Tier in Augenschein genommen hatte., Das Panzernashorn., Das abgebildete Nashorn war mit großer Wahrscheinlichkeit das erste lebende Exemplar seiner Art seit dem 3. Jahrhundert, das in Europa zu sehen war; Belege weisen Nashörner in den Wildgehegen von Herrschern Roms nach, Domitian, Commodus und Caracalla sollen Tiere dieser Art besessen haben. Dürers Holzschnitt hat durch den rüstungsartigen Ausdruck des Dickhäuters vermutlich nicht unwesentlich dazu beigetragen, dass das asiatische \\"Rhinoceros unicornis\\" im Deutschen die Bezeichnung „Panzernashorn“ erhielt. Bis zur zweiten Hälfte des 18. Jahrhunderts erachtete man seine Darstellung als eine naturgetreue Wiedergabe, und der Holzschnitt wurde mehrfach kopiert, neu gedruckt und vertrieben. Erst als in den 1740er und 1750er Jahren das Rhinozeros Clara in Europa gezeigt wurde, kamen zunehmend Abbildungen in Umlauf, die nach dem Leben gefertigt worden waren., Geschenk aus Ostasien., Am 20. Mai 1515 landete ein Nashorn im Hafen von Lissabon; es war der bis dahin ungewöhnlichste Import der erst seit wenigen Jahren bestehenden Seeroute nach Indien. Die Portugiesen waren erfolgreich gewesen, wo Columbus versagt hatte; auf den Spuren früherer portugiesischer Seefahrer waren sie der westafrikanischen Küste gefolgt, hatten das Kap der Guten Hoffnung umrundet und waren nach Durchquerung des Arabischen Meeres 1498 nach Indien gelangt. In den folgenden Jahrzehnten spielte Portugal eine wesentliche Rolle im lukrativen Gewürzhandel. Die Portugiesen eroberten unter Führung von Afonso de Albuquerque im November 1510 das zu Indien gehörige Goa und machten es zu ihrer wichtigsten Handelsniederlassung; weitere fünfzig befestigte Siedlungen entlang der indischen Westküste dienten als Handelsstützpunkte. Der Austausch offizieller Geschenke begleitete die Verhandlungen mit den lokalen Herrschern., Afonso de Albuquerque, der Vertreter der portugiesischen Krone in Indien, hatte das Nashorn zu Beginn des Jahres 1514 von Sultan Muzafar II., dem Herrscher von Cambay (im heutigen Gujarat) als Bestandteil eines solchen diplomatischen Geschenkeaustausches erhalten. De Albuquerque beschloss, das Nashorn, in der Landessprache \\"ganda\\", seinem König, Manuel I. von Portugal, zum Geschenk zu machen. An Bord der „Nossa Senhora da Ajuda“ und in Begleitung zweier weiterer portugiesischer Schiffe verließ das Nashorn zusammen mit seinem indischen Wärter Ocem im Januar 1515 Goa und segelte mit kurzen Aufenthalten in Mosambik, St. Helena und auf den Azoren nach Lissabon. Nach einer Seereise von 120 Tagen wurde das Nashorn in der Nähe des sich im Bau befindlichen Belem-Turms an Land gebracht. Der Turm erhielt später an seiner Nordwestseite die Skulptur eines Nashornkopfes., Das exotische Tier wurde in König Manuels I. Menagerie im Ribeira-Palast in Lissabon untergebracht. Manuel I. besaß eine umfangreiche Menagerie, die auch Elefanten umfasste. Nashörner waren in Europa seit Jahrhunderten nicht lebend gesehen worden und nahmen eher den Status eines mythischen Wesens ein. Am 3. Juni 1515 ließ Manuel I. einen jungen Elefanten und das Nashorn aufeinander treffen, um den Bericht von Plinius dem Älteren zu überprüfen, dass Elefanten und Nashörner erbitterte Gegner seien. Unter den Augen einer großen und lauten Menschenmenge, die sich versammelt hatte, um diesem Spektakel beizuwohnen, bewegte sich das Nashorn langsam und zielgerichtet in Richtung seines Gegners. Der junge Elefant dagegen, verwirrt von dem Getöse der ungewohnten Menschenmenge, floh in Panik vom Kampffeld, bevor es zu einer Auseinandersetzung zwischen den beiden Tieren kam., Geschenk an Papst Leo X.., Das Nashorn blieb bis Ende des Jahres 1515 Bestandteil der Menagerie von Manuel I. Dann wurde es als Geschenk an den Medici-Papst Leo X. weitergereicht. Manuel I. lag daran, sich das Wohlwollen des Papstes zu sichern. Im 1494 abgeschlossenen Vertrag von Tordesillas hatte Papst Alexander VI., ein Vorgänger von Leo X., eine zirka 370 Meilen westlich der Azoren liegende Grenze als Demarkationslinie zwischen dem spanischen und portugiesischen Kolonialreich festgelegt. Damit war der amerikanische Kontinent aufgeteilt. Unzureichend geklärt blieb allerdings, wo in Ostasien diese Demarkationslinie verlief– dies war jedoch ausschlaggebend für die Frage, welchen Anteil Spanien und Portugal am lukrativen Gewürzhandel mit Ostasien haben würden. Bezüglich dieser Grenze zwischen den Einflussgebieten der beiden Länder fiel erneut dem Papst eine entscheidende Rolle zu– Anlass genug, sich seine Gunst durch Geschenke zu sichern. 1514 hatte Manuel I. dem Papst bereits den Indischen Elefanten Hanno zum Geschenk gemacht., Das Nashorn von Lissabon war bereits vor seiner Reise nach Rom dort bekannt geworden. Der Florentiner Arzt und Dichter Giovanni Giacomo Penni hatte bereits kurz nach dem Eintreffen des Tiers in Lissabon einen Traktat in Versen mit dem Titel \\"Forma e natura e costumi de lo Rinocerothe\\" verfasst. Dieser erschien im Juli 1515 in Rom und ist nur in einem einzigen Exemplar erhalten, das sich in der \\"Bibliotheca Colombina\\" in Sevilla befindet. Er enthält auf dem Titelblatt einen Holzschnitt von einem Rhinozeros., Im Dezember 1515 wurde das Nashorn mit einem neuen Halsband ausgestattet, es erhielt einen „grünen Samtkragen mit Rosen und vergoldeten Ösen“ und dazu eine „Kette von vergoldetem Eisen“. „Mit Fransen geschmückt“ wurde es zusammen mit anderen wertvollen Geschenken, wie Tafelsilbern und Gewürzen, per Schiff auf die Reise nach Rom geschickt. Die Fahrt wurde vor Marseille kurz unterbrochen. Der französische König Franz I., der sich zu dem Zeitpunkt in der Provence aufhielt, hatte gewünscht, das exotische Tier in Augenschein zu nehmen. Am 24. Januar präsentierte man ihm mit allerlei Pomp den Dickhäuter auf der Insel Château d’If in der Bucht von Marseille., Es war das letzte Mal, dass das Panzernashorn Land betrat. In einem Sturm zerschellte das Segelschiff an der ligurischen Küste nördlich von La Spezia; das mit Ketten ans Deck gefesselte Nashorn ertrank. Der Kadaver wurde wenig später in der Nähe von Villefranche an die Küste gespült; die Haut kam zurück nach Lissabon. Mit Stroh ausgestopft und fachgerecht montiert schickte man das Tier erneut nach Rom, wo es nicht vor Februar 1516 eintraf., Nachleben., Das Präparat erregte bei weitem nicht die Aufmerksamkeit, die man dem lebenden Nashorn in Lissabon gezollt hatte. Gleichwohl malte Giovanni da Udine dem Papst das Nashorn in eine Ecke von dessen Palazzo Baldassini, und Raffael setzte später noch eine weitere Abbildung nach dem Exponat in ein Gemälde für die Loggien des Papstpalastes im Vatikan., Der weitere Verbleib des ausgestopften Nashorns ist ungeklärt; diese Ungewissheit war Anregung für den 1996 erschienenen Roman \\"The Popes Rhinoceros\\" von Lawrence Norfolk. Für die Annahme, dass die Medici es für ihre naturgeschichtliche Sammlung nach Florenz bringen ließen, gibt es keinen Beleg. Das Universitätsmuseum La Specola in Florenz besitzt ein ausgestopftes Nilpferd und ein Löwenpräparat, erworben von den Medici im 18. Jahrhundert; es gibt aber keinen Hinweis auf ein Rhinoceros in einer der fünf Florentiner naturgeschichtlichen Sammlungen. Möglicherweise wurde es bei der Plünderung Roms im Jahre 1527 zerstört. Kaum belegbar, aber häufig anzutreffen ist die Vermutung, das Präparat befinde sich noch im Vatikan., Im fünften Buch seines Gargantua setzte François Rabelais (1483/1494–1553) einem Nashorn, das ihm ein \\"Heinrich Klerberg\\" „früher einmal gezeigt“ habe, ein literarisches Denkmal; er fand, es unterscheide sich kaum von einem Eber. Der Gewährsmann ist als Johannes Kleberger zu identifizieren, einen Kaufmann aus Nürnberg, der zur selben Zeit wie Rabelais in Lyon wohnte und als ein Freund der Künste bekannt war; 1526 hatte er sich von Dürer malen lassen., Dürers Holzschnitt., Der aus Mähren stammende und in Lissabon ansässige Valentim Fernandes sah das Nashorn kurz nach dessen Ankunft in der portugiesischen Hauptstadt und beschrieb es im Juni 1515 in einem Brief an einen Freund in Nürnberg. Der in deutscher Sprache geschriebene Originalbrief ist nicht erhalten. Eine Abschrift in italienischer Sprache wird in der Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florenz aufbewahrt. Ein zweiter Brief eines unbekannten Absenders mit einer Skizze wurde etwa um die gleiche Zeit von Lissabon nach Nürnberg gesandt und diente als Information über das Aussehen des wilden Tieres, vermerkt am oberen Bildrand des Holzschnittes von Dürer., Die Entstehung des Holzschnitts., Auf der Basis dieser beiden Quellen machte Dürer zwei Zeichnungen. Nach der zweiten Zeichnung entstand der Druckstock des Holzschnitts. Dürer hat ihn wahrscheinlich nicht selbst angefertigt, sondern einen „Formschneider“ damit beauftragt, den Druckstock nach der Zeichnung zu erstellen. Verwendet wurde vermutlich Birnenholz– ausreichend weich, um die feinteilige Wiedergabe zu ermöglichen, aber hart genug, um eine für den geschäftlichen Erfolg hinreichende Anzahl von Abzügen zu gewährleisten., In seiner 1495 gegründeten Werkstatt druckte Dürer seine Grafiken im Eigenverlag und auf Vorrat. Vertrieben wurden sie über Händler, die seine Drucke auf Messen und Märkten feilboten. Die Entscheidung Dürers, das Tier in einem Holzschnitt und nicht als Kupferstich wiederzugeben, folgte womöglich einem kaufmännischen Kalkül. Kupferstiche sind zeitaufwendiger und deshalb deutlich teurer als Holzdrucke, allerdings nutzt der hölzerne Druckstock sich im Gegensatz zu dem aus Metall schneller ab. Die Darstellung eines Nashorns war ein ungewöhnliches Sujet, denn die Kunden fragten gewöhnlich Bilder mit religiösen Themen nach. Daher könnte es wichtig gewesen sein, das Blatt erschwinglich zu halten., Details des Holzschnitts., Der Holzschnitt trägt folgende Inschrift:, Dürers Holzschnitt enthält nicht nur ein falsches Ankunftsdatum des Nashorns in Lissabon, sondern auch eine anatomisch nicht korrekte Darstellung des Dickhäuters.

Englisch werden sie auch \\"ostrich dinosaurs\\" („Straußendinosaurier“) genannt., Die Ornithomimosauria waren schlank gebaute, und mit zwei bis fünf Metern Länge mittelgroße Vertreter der Theropoden. Sie konnten vermutlich sehr schnell laufen, wobei sie wie alle Theropoden obligat biped waren, das heißt nur auf den Hinterbeinen liefen. Bis auf die urtümlichen Vertreter waren sie zahnlos. Wovon sie sich ernährten, ist bis heute nicht geklärt. Sie lebten in der Kreidezeit vor rund 134 bis 66 Millionen Jahren, der Großteil der Fossilfunde stammt aus dem östlichen Asien und dem westlichen Nordamerika. Informell lassen sich einige urtümliche Vertreter – \\"Pelecanimimus\\", \\"Shenzhousaurus\\", \\"Harpymimus\\" und \\"Garudimimus\\" – von den „höheren“ Ornithomimosauriern, den Ornithomimidae, unterscheiden., Merkmale., Schädel und Zähne., Der Schädel der Ornithomimosauria war relativ klein und saß auf einem langen Hals. Der Schädel war leicht gebaut, die Schnauze war langgestreckt, die Augen sehr groß. Die Schädelhöhle war groß und barg ein gut entwickeltes Gehirn. Das Schädeldach war meist flach, im Gegensatz zu anderen Theropoda waren außer bei \\"Pelecanimimus\\" keine Schädelkämme vorhanden. Der Hirnschädel und die Schnauzenregion waren pneumatisiert, das heißt mit luftgefüllten Hohlräumen versehen. An der Spitze des Oberkiefers saß das Zwischenkieferbein (Praemaxillare). Dieses wies einen langen, nach hinten reichenden Fortsatz auf, der die hintere Begrenzung des Nasenlochs bildete. Dieser Fortsatz ist eine systematisch bedeutsame Synapomorphie, ein gemeinsames abgeleitetes Merkmal. Bei manchen Vertretern wie \\"Garudimimus\\" und \\"Gallimimus\\" war das Zwischenkieferbein U-förmig, bei anderen wie etwa \\"Struthiomimus\\" zugespitzt. Dahinter befand sich der flache, niedrige Oberkieferknochen (Maxillare)., Der Schädel wies wie bei allen Theropoda mehrere Schädelfenster auf. Die beiden Temporalfenster (die Schädelfenster der Schläfenregion) waren klein, das Antorbitalfenster (das Schädelfenster vor dem Auge) hingegen vergrößert. Zusätzlich waren davor noch ein Maxillarfenster und manchmal noch ein weiteres Promaxillarfenster vorhanden. Das Nasenbein war langgestreckt, das paarige Stirn- und Scheitelbein bildeten die flache Schädeldecke., Der Unterkiefer war schlank und langgestreckt, das Dentale – der vordere, zahntragende Teil des Unterkiefers – war schlank und länglich und seitlich betrachtet annähernd dreieckig. Ein Fund von \\"Ornithomimus\\" ließ am Ober- und Unterkiefer die Überreste eines Schnabels aus Keratin erkennen, der dicht verschlossen werden konnte., Die urtümlicheren Gattungen der Ornithomimosauria besaßen noch Zähne: \\"Pelecanimimus\\", der basalste Vertreter, trug rund 220 kleine Zähne im Oberkiefer (am Prämaxillare und Maxillare) und Unterkiefer. Bei allen anderen Tieren war der Oberkiefer zahnlos, \\"Shenzhousaurus\\" und \\"Harpymimus\\" besaßen noch Zähne im Unterkiefer, vermutlich rund neun bis elf pro Kieferhälfte. Alle anderen Ornithomimosauria waren gänzlich zahnlos. Die Zähne der urtümlichen Vertreter wiesen keine Zacken an den Zähnen (Serration) auf, wie sie für Theropoda typisch sind. Die Zähne waren annähernd kegelförmig und hatten einen runden Grundriss., Das Gehirn dieser Tiere dürfte relativ groß gewesen sein. Schädelabgüsse ergaben, dass das Vorderhirn (Prosencephalon) vergrößert war, der Riechkolben hingegen klein. Der Gesichtssinn war – auch aufgrund der großen Augen – vermutlich gut entwickelt, der Geruchssinn hingegen nicht., Rumpfskelett und Gliedmaßen., Die Wirbelsäule der Ornithomimosauria bestand aus 10 Hals-, 13 Brust-, 6 Kreuz- und rund 35 Schwanzwirbeln. Der Schwanz war wie bei allen Vertretern der Tetanurae versteift. Diese Versteifung wurde einerseits dadurch erreicht, dass die Schwanzwirbel durch lange, nach vorne und hinten reichende Knochenstäbe (Zygapophysen) und andererseits durch Chevronknochen (V-förmige Fortsätze an der Unterseite der Schwanzwirbel) verbunden waren., Der Schultergürtel war leicht gebaut, im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Theropoda fehlte das Gabelbein (Furcula). Die Arme waren verlängert, die Hände eher groß, aber leicht gebaut und nicht an eine räuberische Lebensweise angepasst. Die Hand bestand aus den Strahlen (Mittelhandknochen und Finger) I, II und III (vom Daumen her gezählt), der erste Finger setzte sich aus zwei, der zweite Finger aus drei und der dritte Finger aus vier Fingergliedern (Phalangen) zusammen. Da das erste Fingerglied des ersten Fingers das längste war, waren alle Finger annähernd gleich lang. Eine Besonderheit – zumindest der höher entwickelten Ornithomimosauria – war, dass der Mittelhandknochen (Metacarpus) des ersten Strahls im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Theropoden annähernd gleich lang wie die der beiden anderen Strahlen war. Die Finger endeten in Krallen, die an der Unterseite abgerundet und für räuberische Zwecke ungeeignet waren., Das Becken war eher klein und leicht gebaut; das Darmbein war langgestreckt und trug am vorderen Ende einen nach unten ragenden Fortsatz. Das Schambein ragte nach vorne und unten, das nach hinten weisende Sitzbein war am hinteren Ende bei den meisten Vertretern nach vorne gebogen., Die Hinterbeine waren länger als die Vorderbeine und in Relation zur Körpergröße auch länger als bei den meisten anderen Theropoda. Der Unterschenkel war um mehr als zehn Prozent länger als der Oberschenkel, Schien- und Wadenbein waren am unteren Ende des Beines fest zusammengedrückt. Die erste Zehe war bei den urtümlicheren Vertretern wie bei allen Theropoda bereits verkürzt, bei den Ornithomimidae fehlte sie völlig. Die Zehen II, III und IV waren symmetrisch nach vorne gerichtet, die dritte (mittlere) war die längste, die zweite und vierte annähernd gleich lang. Die drei nach vorne ragenden Zehen trugen Klauen aus Horn (Keratin), sie waren im Querschnitt dreieckig und an der Unterseite flach. Der Mittelfuß war schmal und verlängert. Bei den „urtümlichen“ Vertretern befanden sich die drei Mittelfußknochen noch nebeneinander, bei den Ornithomimidae berührten sich die oberen Enden des zweiten und vierten Mittelfußknochens und der obere Abschnitt des dritten Mittelfußknochens verjüngte sich nach oben stark. Dieser Bau des Mittelfußes wird als „arctometatarsal“ bezeichnet und besaß gegen Ende des 20. Jahrhunderts eine gewisse Bedeutung für die Systematik der „höheren“ Theropoden. Das Taxon, das sich auf diesem Merkmal gründete, trug den Namen Arctometatarsalia. Nach aktuellem Kenntnisstand zur Stammesgeschichte der „höheren“ Theropoden ist dieses Taxon identisch mit den Ornithomimosauria und der Name wird deshalb nicht mehr benutzt., Körperbedeckung., Über die Körperbedeckung (Integument) der Ornithomimosauria gab es lange Zeit aus dem Fossilbericht außer den Abdrücken eines Hautkammes am Kopf und eines Kehlsacks bei \\"Pelecanimimus\\" keine Hinweise. Die Entdeckung mehrerer gefiederter Dinosaurier seit Mitte der 1990er-Jahre und die phylogenetischen Untersuchungen ließen es jedoch denkbar erscheinen, dass diese Dinosaurier Federn aufwiesen., Im Oktober 2012 wurden Fossilien eines Jungtieres und zweier adulter Exemplare von \\"Ornithomimus\\" in einer etwa 72 Millionen Jahre alten Gesteinsschicht beschrieben, die zeigen, dass die Tiere eine daunenartige Befiederung hatten und die Älteren zusätzlich an den Vorderarmen längere Federn besaßen, die ihren Vordergliedmaßen ein dem Vogelflügel ähnliches Aussehen gaben. Die späte Entwicklung der langen Vorderarmbefiederung lässt vermuten, dass sie möglicherweise der Kommunikation mit Artgenossen (intraspezifische Kommunikation), dem Imponierverhalten diente oder den Eiern brütender Tiere zusätzlichen Schutz bot. Der Fund ist der erste Hinweis auf eine Ausbildung flügelartiger Vordergliedmaßen bei Dinosauriern, die nicht zu den Maniraptora gehören., Paläobiologie., Fortbewegung und Sozialverhalten., Wie alle Theropoda waren die Ornithomimosauria Zehengänger (digitigrad) und konnten ihre Beine nur in der Sagittalebene (vorwärts-rückwärts) bewegen – es war ihnen nicht möglich, die Gliedmaßen nach außen zu drehen, wie es etwa Säugetiere können. Der Körper war über dem Becken ausbalanciert, die Wirbelsäule wurde annähernd waagrecht gehalten. Um dennoch eine gute Sicht nach vorne zu ermöglichen, war der Hals S-förmig gebogen. Der versteifte Schwanz stand waagrecht nach hinten. Aufgrund des Baus ihrer Hinterbeine – insbesondere der langen Unterschenkel und der modifizierten Mittelfußknochen – gelten die Ornithomimosauria als schnelle Läufer. Ein Vergleich des Beckens und der Hinterbeine dieser Dinosaurier mit denen von Laufvögeln kam aufgrund der rekonstruierten Muskulatur zu dem Schluss, dass Ornithomimosauria die Geschwindigkeit, nicht aber die Manövrierfähigkeit der heutigen Vögel erreichten. Andere Schätzungen über die Höchstgeschwindigkeit dieser Tiere belaufen sich auf 35 bis 60km/h., Aussagen über das Sozialverhalten der Ornithomimosauria sind schwierig, wie bei allen nur durch Fossilfunde bekannten Tieren. Selbst Funde von Überresten mehrerer Tiere an einem Ort (Taphozönose) müssen nicht auf ein Gruppenleben hindeuten, sondern können auch durch bestimmte Umstände bei der Einbettung der Körper im Sediment erklärt werden. Die meisten Funde stammen von Einzeltieren, zwei Entdeckungen sprechen aber für ein zumindest zeitweiliges Gruppenleben. Von \\"Archaeornithomimus\\" gibt es ein \\"bone bed\\" („Knochenlager“), bei dem die Überreste mehrerer Tiere an einem Ort entdeckt wurden. Bei Überresten von \\"Sinornithomimus\\" lassen die Funde auf ein plötzliches Massensterben einer ganzen Gruppe schließen, die sich sowohl aus Jungtieren als auch aus ausgewachsenen Tieren zusammensetzte. Ob diese beiden Gattungen das ganze Jahr über oder nur saisonal und ob auch andere Vertreter der Ornithomimosauria in Gruppen lebten, ist nicht bekannt., Nahrung., Über die Ernährungsweise der Ornithomimosauria gibt es keine gesicherten Erkenntnisse – sowohl für die urtümlichen bezahnten Vertreter als für die zahnlosen Arten.

Sie besteht aus sieben Staffeln mit 139 Episoden, 1994 folgten zwei Fernsehfilme. Schöpfer der Serie, die hauptsächlich zu den Genres Action, Krimi und Abenteuer gehört, ist Lee David Zlotoff., Richard Dean Anderson ist der Darsteller des Protagonisten \\"Angus MacGyver\\", der als eine Mischung aus Geheimagent, Abenteurer und Nothelfer oft in humanitären Missionen arbeitet, ab der zweiten Staffel für die fiktive \\"Phoenix Foundation\\". Seine auffälligste Fähigkeit ist die praktische Anwendung der Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften und damit verbunden die kombinierte, erfinderische Nutzung alltäglicher Gegenstände. Mit dieser Begabung findet er eine Vielzahl ungewöhnlicher Lösungen für Probleme wie etwa die Flucht aus Gefangenschaft oder die Entschärfung von Sprengsätzen. Besonders wegen dieser gemeinhin als „MacGyverismen“ bezeichneten Erfindungen erlangte die Serie Kultstatus und wurde – bei mittelmäßigen Einschaltquoten in den Vereinigten Staaten – zu einem weltweiten Erfolg, darunter auch im deutschsprachigen Raum. Das Wort \\"MacGyver\\" fand als Synonym für einen Erfinder beziehungsweise Ingenieur Eingang in mehrere Sprachen. Unter anderem mit dem kommerziell wenig erfolgreichen Kinofilm \\"MacGruber\\" wurde die Serie parodiert. Im September 2016 begann die Erstausstrahlung eines gleichnamigen Reboots., Episoden, Staffeln und Filme., \\"Siehe Hauptartikel:\\", Die Fernsehserie besteht aus 139 Episoden von je etwa 45Minuten Länge. In den Vereinigten Staaten wurden sie in sieben Staffeln erstausgestrahlt, von denen die Staffeln 1 bis 6 aus jeweils 19 bis 22 Episoden bestehen und die letzte Staffel 14 Episoden umfasst. Bei der Erstausstrahlung im deutschsprachigen Raum wich der Sender Sat.1 von der Originalreihenfolge der Episoden teilweise stark ab und gruppierte die Episoden in anderer Kombination zu Staffeln. Die Staffelangaben in diesem Artikel beziehen sich, sofern nicht anders angegeben, auf die Staffel-Nummern der US-Erstausstrahlung., 1994 erschienen zwei etwa 90-minütige Fernsehfilme mit MacGyver als Titelfigur., Inhalt., Überblick und Hauptfiguren., Der gegen Ende der fünften Staffel 39-jährige Angus MacGyver (der Vorname wird in der fünften Staffel zum ersten Mal erwähnt) stammt aus der fiktiven Stadt Mission City in Minnesota. Sein äußeres Erscheinungsbild prägen die ab der zweiten Staffel meist blondierte Vokuhila-Frisur und lässige, sportliche Kleidung. In seiner Kindheit starb einer seiner Freunde durch das gemeinsame Spielen mit einer geladenen Pistole. Auch infolge dieses Erlebnisses, von dem der Zuschauer in der vierten Staffel erfährt, vermeidet er im Erwachsenenalter konsequent die Benutzung von Handfeuerwaffen zur Beilegung von Konflikten. Wie sehr er den Gebrauch von Schusswaffen ablehnt, wird insbesondere während eines vorübergehenden Gedächtnisverlustes deutlich: Selbst als er schussbereit mit geladenem Gewehr einem mordlustigen Angreifer gegenübersteht, drückt er nicht ab, sondern setzt ihn anderweitig außer Gefecht. Seine Herangehensweise zur Lösung von Problemen ist generell von Vermeidung tödlicher Gewalt bestimmt. Gegnerische Personen überwältigt er meist, indem er sie in eine Falle lockt oder bei direkter Konfrontation mit gezielten Faustschlägen handlungsunfähig macht., In der ersten Staffel übernimmt MacGyver unter anderem Aufträge für den fiktiven US-Geheimdienst \\"Department of External Services (DXS)\\" und für das Pentagon. Beim DXS arbeitet auch \\"Pete Thornton\\" (* 1933), sein Vorgesetzter und bester Freund, in einer leitenden Position. Ab der zweiten Staffel arbeiten MacGyver und Pete für die fiktive \\"Phoenix Foundation for Research\\". Die landesweit vertretene und international agierende US-Denkfabrik und -Forschungseinrichtung übernimmt hauptsächlich humanitäre Missionen, die von der Unterstützung sozial Bedürftiger bis hin zur zwischenstaatlichen Friedensvermittlung reichen. Pete ist als Direktor für den operativen Bereich tätig. Das Hauptquartier der Phoenix Foundation, ein Bürohochhaus, befindet sich in Los Angeles und bildet den Hauptschauplatz vieler Episoden., MacGyver wohnt in den ersten beiden Staffeln in einem Apartment eines Hauses an einer belebten Strandpromenade. Von der dritten bis zur sechsten Staffel lebt er auf einem Hausboot, das neben anderen Booten in einem Küstenhafen liegt. In der siebten Staffel bewohnt MacGyver wieder ein Apartment. Alle in der Serie vorkommenden Liebesbeziehungen währen nicht länger als eine Episode, was MacGyver mit dem frühen Tod seiner Eltern und einer daraus entstandenen Bindungsangst begründet. Verflossene Liebschaften bilden häufig den Ausgangspunkt für Handlungen späterer Folgen. In der Episode \\"Tod in China\\", die als vorletzte erstausgestrahlt wurde und als Serienabschluss dient, erfährt MacGyver erstmals von seinem mittlerweile erwachsenen Sohn \\"Sam\\". Er beendet seine Arbeit für die Phoenix Foundation und verreist mit ihm., MacGyverismen., Die besondere, im Vorspann mit zahlreichen Einstellungen vorgestellte Eigenschaft MacGyvers ist es, in ausweglos scheinenden Situationen zu improvisieren und vor Ort vorhandene Gegenstände zum Entfliehen aus solchen Situationen kombinieren zu können. Zu solchen Situationen gehören die Flucht vor feindlich gesinnten Personen, das Außergefechtsetzen solcher Personen, das Entkommen aus Gefangenschaft und das Verhindern der Explosion von zeitgesteuerten Sprengsätzen. Nützlich dafür sind ihm neben meist griffbereiten Utensilien – darunter ein Schweizer Taschenmesser, Klebeband und Streichhölzer – seine Kreativität, sein Gespür für physikalische und chemische Zusammenhänge und seine handwerkliche Begabung. In der Episode \\"Der betrogene Betrüger\\" (Staffel 2) charakterisiert ihn eine Frau mit den für ihn typischen „MacGyverisms“ (in der deutschen Synchronfassung: „MacGyverismen“), einem auch außerhalb der Serie verwendeten Synonym für seine Erfindungen. Einige Beispiele für MacGyverismen:, Sein Improvisationstalent dient MacGyver auch dazu, defekte Gegenstände zu reparieren. Zum Beispiel überbrückt er mit Kaugummipapier, das elektrisch leitfähig ist, eine defekte Sicherung, sodass der Strom wieder fließt., Der Zuschauer erfährt schließlich, dass MacGyvers Sohn Sam über ein ähnliches Improvisationstalent wie sein Vater verfügt., Andere Figuren., \\"Penny Parker\\" ist eine junge und ausgesprochen geschwätzige und teils kindlich-naive US-Amerikanerin, die MacGyver erstmals in der ersten Staffel bei einer Mission in Bulgarien zufällig begegnet. Mit wenig Talent, aber großen Träumen, bringt sie ihr Streben nach einer Karriere im Showbusiness mehrfach in Schwierigkeiten., \\"Jack Dalton\\" ist die am häufigsten auftretende Nebenfigur. Jack ist ein Pilot und ein alter Freund von MacGyver. Im Laufe der Serie baut er sich sein eigenes Flugunternehmen auf. Er überredet MacGyver oft dazu, ihm bei waghalsigen Aktionen zu helfen, für die eine Anreise per Flugzeug erforderlich ist. Dass er dabei nicht immer bei der Wahrheit bleibt, bemerken MacGyver und der Zuschauer teilweise an Jacks unfreiwillig zwinkerndem Auge. Zum Beispiel teilt Jack MacGyver mit, dass er sich in einer Notlage befinde; Jack hat sich jedoch tatsächlich absichtlich verhaften lassen und lockt MacGyver zu sich, um mit seiner Hilfe nach einem Schatz zu suchen., \\"Harry Jackson\\" ist ein Großvater von MacGyver und wurde für ihn zu einem Ersatzvater, nachdem sein Vater und seine Großmutter durch einen Autounfall ums Leben gekommen waren. Sieben Jahre nach dem Autounfall verließ er MacGyver. Nach weiteren 16 Jahren treffen Harry und MacGyver in der ersten Staffel erstmals wieder aufeinander und flüchten gemeinsam vor Killern durch die Wildnis. Harry stirbt am Ende der Episode \\"Fähre ins Jenseits\\" (Staffel 5) an einem Herzinfarkt., Die verwitwete \\"Nicole Anne „Nikki“ Carpenter\\" spielt in sechs Episoden der dritten Staffel mit und wird in der Episode \\"Wer zuletzt lacht, lacht am besten\\" als Versicherungsdetektivin und Schwester eines Freundes von MacGyver eingeführt. Beginnend mit ihrem nächsten Auftritt, arbeitet sie in der Phoenix Foundation, oft an der Seite MacGyvers., Die \\"Coltons\\" sind eine dunkelhäutige Familie, zu der die Mutter und ihre drei Söhne \\"Frank, Jesse\\" und \\"Billy\\" gehören. Die beiden älteren Brüder, Frank und Jesse, sind Prämienjäger, die auf Kopfgeldjagd spezialisiert sind. Der junge Billy eifert ihnen bezüglich dieser Berufswahl nach. Der erste Auftritt eines Coltons ist der von Jesse in der Episode \\"Mutter Dalton\\" (Staffel 4). In dieser und in fünf späteren Episoden trifft MacGyver mit je einem der Colton-Brüder bei der Suche nach Kriminellen zusammen, die sie gemeinsam fortsetzen. Ihren letzten und zugleich einzigen gemeinsamen Auftritt haben die vier Coltons in der Episode \\"Die Coltons\\" (Staffel 7), in der MacGyver ausnahmsweise nur eine Nebenfigur ist., Zu den wiederkehrenden Nebenfiguren, die in je drei Episoden auftreten, gehören die folgenden Personen:, In den beiden Fernsehfilmen treten weder Pete noch die aus der Serie bekannten Nebenfiguren auf., Häufige Themen und Aufträge., In vielen Episoden geht es um die Aufklärung von Kriminalfällen. Dabei spielen oft Drogen, Mord, Betrug, Diebstahl, Geldwäsche und Falschgeld eine Rolle. MacGyver unterstützt einmal das Drogendezernat der städtischen Polizei, indem er ein Gerät entwickelt, mit dem sich bei Razzien Türen ohne Schusswaffe öffnen lassen. Manchmal geht es um Terrorismus. Zum Beispiel verhindert MacGyver mit seinem Großvater, dass Terroristen das Phoenix-Gebäude sprengen., In etlichen Episoden geht es um die Suche nach einem Schatz, sei es ein Goldschatz, eine große Menge Geld oder ein archäologisch bedeutsamer Gegenstand. Entsprechende Episoden spielen oft außerhalb des Hauptschauplatzes. Nach der so genannten „Heiligen Rose“ sucht MacGyver mit einer Archäologin in Südengland und Nordfrankreich; dabei entdecken sie, dass der Laser schon viel früher als angenommen erfunden worden war. Weitere Schätze, nach denen MacGyver mit befreundeten Personen sucht, sind das Grab Alexanders des Großen und der Riesensaphir „Auge des Osiris“ in der Türkei sowie ein Schatz der Inkas in Peru, der sich letztlich nicht als das erwartete Gold erweist, sondern als Getreidevorrat. Am Nordpolarkreis ist MacGyver Teil einer amerikanisch-sowjetischen Expedition, die nach Goldbarren im Wert von Hunderten Millionen Dollar sucht., Es: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Actionfernsehserie, Fernsehserie (American Broadcasting Company), Fernsehserie (Vereinigte Staaten), Fernsehserie der 1980er Jahre, Fernsehserie der 1990er Jahre, Kriminal-Fernsehserie, MacGyver, Lee David Zlotoff, Richard Dean Anderson, Phoenix Foundation"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Kritik am Christentum, Literarisches Werk, Literatur (18. Jahrhundert), Literatur (Französisch), Religionskritische Literatur, Sachliteratur, Werk von Paul Henri Thiry d’Holbach], Das entschleierte Christentum, oder Prüfung der Prinzipien und Wirkungen der christlichen Religion \\"(Le christianisme dévoilé, ou Examen des principes et des effets de la religion chrétienne)\\" ist ein dem Baron d’Holbach zugeschriebenes antichristliches Buch, das vermutlich 1766 unter Pseudonym in Nancy veröffentlicht wurde., In seinem religionskritischen Erstlingswerk weist Holbach auf Aspekte des christlichen Glaubens hin, die seines Erachtens widersprüchlich sind, und kritisiert besonders den moralischen und politischen Einfluss der christlichen Religion samt ihrem Klerus mit scharfen Worten. Die dargelegten Feststellungen finden zahlreiche Entsprechungen in Holbachs späteren Werken, enthalten jedoch nur latent atheistische Äußerungen und greifen noch hauptsächlich das Christentum im Gegensatz zur Religion im Allgemeinen an., Anders als frühere religionskritische Veröffentlichungen hat \\"Le christianisme dévoilé\\" keine Analyse über den historischen Ursprung von Religionen oder das Projekt einer deistischen Alternativreligion zum Inhalt, sondern gibt sich unverblümt als antichristliche Propagandaschrift zu erkennen. Das Buch löste in philosophisch-aufklärerischen Kreisen lebhafte Reaktionen aus und wurde sofort nach seinem Erscheinen von den französischen Behörden beschlagnahmt., Verfasser., \\"Le christianisme dévoilé\\" wurde unter dem Namen „verstorbener M. Boulanger“ veröffentlicht. Schon Zeitgenossen zweifelten an der Autorschaft Nicolas Antoine Boulangers, der für seine posthum veröffentlichten philosophisch-historischen Werke bekannt war, und stellten Mutmaßungen über den wahren Autor an. So schreibt etwa Voltaire 1766 in einem Brief an den Materialisten Helvétius:, Voltaire, der auch selbst häufig Pseudonyme verwendete, war von den Verdächtigungen nicht ausgenommen. In seiner Korrespondenz von 1768 nennt er seinen kürzlich verstorbenen Freund Étienne Noël Damilaville (1723–1768) als Autor – wahrscheinlich, um den Verdacht von sich selbst abzulenken., Die Zuschreibung an Boulanger ist höchstwahrscheinlich auf die Ähnlichkeit des Titels zu dessen Werk \\"L’antiquité dévoilée\\" zurückzuführen. Seit Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts wurde \\"Le christianisme dévoilé\\" in mehrere von Boulangers Werkausgaben aufgenommen. Auch die These von Damilaville als Autor wurde hin und wieder geäußert. Der Schriftsteller und Kritiker Jean-François de La Harpe berichtete, dass Damilaville den Text teilweise von Diderot diktiert bekommen habe. Die Bücher habe Damilaville bei sich gelagert und für 10 Écus je Exemplar verkauft., Der Bibliothekar und Bibliograph Antoine-Alexandre Barbier widerspricht den Ausführungen La Harpes und stellt Holbach als Autor fest. Laut Barbier wurde das Manuskript Jean-François de Saint-Lambert anvertraut, der es bei dem Verleger Le Clerc in Nancy drucken ließ. Durch Indiskretion habe der Verleger beinahe den Verfasser des Buches und seinen Überbringer in Schwierigkeiten gebracht. Von Nancy seien die Exemplare nach Ferney gelangt, wo Voltaire die zwei ersten Exemplare Damilaville habe zuschicken lassen. Offiziere hätten dann die Bücher massenweise nach Paris gebracht., Bereits vor Barbier hatte Sylvain Maréchal das Werk in seinem \\"Dictionnaire des athées anciens et modernes\\" Holbach zugeschrieben. Die Autorschaft Holbachs wurde zwei Jahrzehnte später von André Morellet bestätigt., Eine Untersuchung charakteristischer Stilmerkmale Holbachs durch Rudolf Besthorn ergab klare Entsprechungen. Die für Holbach typischen Wiederholungen und Verweise auf vorhergehende Zusammenhänge sind vorhanden, wenn auch nicht in dem Maße wie im 1770 veröffentlichten \\"Système de la nature\\" (System der Natur). Die sehr ähnlichen inhaltlichen Beziehungen zu den gesicherten Werken Holbachs, die bis zu wortwörtlichen Übereinstimmungen gehen, bestätigen dessen Autorschaft und lassen Boulanger, Voltaire und Damilaville auch aus stil- und inhaltskritischer Sicht als Urheber ausscheiden. Eine Mitautorschaft Diderots an dem Werk kann nicht nachgewiesen werden. Indirekte Äußerungen Diderots von 1762 deuten jedoch darauf hin, dass Diderot und Helvétius Kenntnis dieser und anderer Schriften Holbachs hatten, und den Verfasser mit Ratschlägen unterstützten., Datierung., Die früheste bekannte Ausgabe von \\"Le christianisme dévoilé\\" gibt auf dem Titelblatt 1756 als Erscheinungsjahr an. Dieses Datum ist entweder fehlerhaft oder zum Zweck der Irreführung fingiert, denn der als verstorbener Verfasser genannte Nicolas-Antoine Boulanger verstarb in Wirklichkeit erst drei Jahre später. Das dem Werk vorangestellte Vorwort ist mit „4. Mai 1758“ datiert. Außerdem wird im Buch das Werk \\"Recherches sur l’origine du despotisme oriental\\" zitiert, das erst 1761 erschien., Da im Erstdruck des Werks auf kein Ereignis nach 1761 Bezug genommen wird, liegt es nahe, das Erscheinungsdatum des Werks auf dieses Jahr zu verlegen. Diese Annahme deckt sich mit dem in Barbiers \\"Dictionnaire des ouvrages anonymes et pseudonymes\\" angegebenen Datum. Wahrscheinlicher ist jedoch eine Erstveröffentlichung im Jahr 1766, denn erst ab diesem Zeitpunkt findet das Werk in der philosophischen Korrespondenz und anderen Schriftstücken plötzlich häufig Erwähnung. Für das spätere Datum spricht auch, dass im Titelblatt eines Exemplars der \\"Bibliothèque nationale\\" das Datum von MDCCLVI (1756) durch nachträgliche Einfügung eines „X“ (10) auf MDCCLXVI (1766) korrigiert wurde. Eine Untersuchung der frühesten bekannten Ausgabe ergibt außerdem, dass die Wasserzeichen des Papiers mit 1762 oder 1763 datiert sind., Das Manuskript kann nicht vor 1762 fertiggestellt worden sein, da das zitierte Werk Boulangers, \\"Recherches sur l’origine du despotisme oriental,\\" erst ab Januar 1762 Erwähnung findet. Andererseits fällt auf, dass das andere von Boulanger hinterlassene Werk, \\"L’antiquité dévoilée,\\" mit keinem Wort erwähnt wird. Dieses Werk wurde im November 1765 als im Druck erschienen angezeigt. Daraus kann geschlossen werden, dass das Manuskript von \\"Le christianisme dévoilé\\" zwischen 1762 und Ende 1765 abgeschlossen und im Jahr 1766 veröffentlicht wurde., Aufbau., Dem Werk ist ein Vorwort in Form einer Antwort auf einen angeblichen Brief eines Lesers vorangestellt, das bereits die wichtigsten Punkte des Werks vorwegnimmt. Der Einleitung über die Notwendigkeit, die Religion einer kritischen Überprüfung zu unterwerfen, folgt in den ersten beiden Kapiteln ein Abriss über die Geschichte des Judentums und Christentums. Daraufhin werden die Glaubensinhalte des Christentums im Einzelnen behandelt und kritisiert. Besonders ausführlich geht Holbach anschließend auf die christliche Moral ein; das Kapitel über die christlichen Tugenden ist das längste des gesamten Werks. Nach einem Kapitel über die religiösen Pflichten und Handlungen folgt eine Darstellung der politischen Auswirkungen der Religion und der Priesterschaft. Die Schlussbetrachtung fasst die Grundgedanken der Schrift noch einmal zusammen und erörtert insbesondere die Aufgaben des aufgeklärten Herrschers., Holbach führt in seiner Schrift eine Vielzahl sehr unterschiedlicher Einwände gegen das Christentum an. Seine Argumente aus dem Bereich der praktischen Philosophie umfassen moralische Bedenken gegen den Gott der Bibel, handlungstheoretische Erwägungen, Einwände gegen die christliche Moral und die christlichen Tugenden sowie einige kritische Argumente aus dem Bereich der politischen Philosophie. Unter dem Gesichtspunkt der theoretischen Philosophie kritisiert Holbach die verfehlte Begrifflichkeit des christlichen Glaubens in Bezug auf die behaupteten Eigenschaften Gottes und stellt darüber hinaus sprachphilosophische sowie erkenntnistheoretische Überlegungen an., Obwohl sich das Buch an eine nur durchschnittlich gebildete Leserschaft wandte, die möglichst schnell überzeugt werden sollte, gab Holbach in seinen Fußnoten zahlreiche Quellen an. Neben Werken der Geschichtsschreibung wird aus verschiedenen religionskritischen Schriften zitiert, darunter die Werke von Jean Meslier, Peter Annet (1693–1769), Thomas Woolston (1668–1733) und Anthony Collins. Der in \\"Le christianisme dévoilé\\" dargelegte Stoff ist größtenteils auch in anderen zeitgenössischen Schriften nachweisbar. Neu ist die Aufbereitung im Sinne einer möglichst schlagkräftigen Gesamtdarstellung, die auf taktische politische Erwägungen keine Rücksicht nimmt., Inhalt., Vorwort und Einleitung., Im Vorwort beantwortet Holbach den angeblichen Brief eines Lesers, welcher einerseits der Kritik an den christlichen Glaubensvorstellungen zustimmt, aber andererseits einwendet, dass das gemeine Volk eine Religion brauche, da es ansonsten durch nichts von Verbrechen abgehalten werden würde. Holbach entgegnet, dass nicht die Religion, sondern Gesetze das Volk zügelten, und stellt deshalb dem Kritiker die Frage, ob er etwa zu jenen „kleinmütigen Denkern“ gehöre, „die meinen, die Wahrheit könne schaden“. Alles deutet darauf hin, dass das Vorwort an Voltaire gerichtet ist, und dass Holbach dessen vorhersehbare Einwände gegen den Inhalt des Buchs von vornherein entkräften wollte., Holbach stellt in der Einleitung klar, dass die Anbetung eines Gottes nicht mit der zu erwartenden Belohnung oder Bestrafung durch diesen Gott begründet werden sollte. Vielmehr müsse der Mensch Vernunft anwenden, um die Ursachen seiner Wünsche und Befürchtungen zu ergründen, und nur wenige seien dazu bereit. Der Einzelne, ob arm ob reich, halte nur deshalb am Glauben fest, weil man ihn von Kindheit an so erzogen und unterrichtet habe; auf diese Weise hätten sich religiöse Ansichten über Jahrhunderte halten können:, Da die christliche Religion ihrem als grausam und bösartig beschriebenen Gott eine Vorbildfunktion attestiere, habe sie dem Volk nur Hass, Zwietracht und Gewalt gebracht. Auch Könige und Herrscher hätten durch das Christentum nichts gewonnen, da sie sich immer wieder dem Priestertum hätten fügen müssen. Umso wichtiger sei es, den Schleier des Christentums zu lüften und dessen Prinzipien zu ergründen., Geschichte und Ursprung der judeo-christlichen Religionen (Kapitel 2 und 3)., Die Geschichte der jüdischen und christlichen Religion wird vom Verfasser kurz und in trockenen Worten beschrieben; das von Fontenelle \\"(De l’origine des fables)\\" und Boulanger \\"(L’antiquité dévoilée)\\" verfolgte Ziel, durch eine historische Analyse die menschlich-psychologischen Ursachen der Glaubensvorstellungen aufzudecken, interessiert ihn dabei nur am Rande.

Die Fossilien stammen aus einer Phosphatmine der Upper-Bone-Valley-Formation bei Fort Meade in Florida. Sie werden der sogenannten Palmetto-Fauna oder Whidden Creek Local Fauna zugeordnet, die vor etwa fünf Millionen Jahren im heutigen Zentralflorida lebte., \\"Rhizosmilodon\\" war wie andere Säbelzahnkatzen ein Fleischfresser, der wahrscheinlich aktiv seine Beute jagte und tötete. Dabei handelte es sich wohl um ein kleineres bis mittelgroßes Säugetier, wobei das Beutespektrum dem des Pumas ähnelte. Der Lebensraum in Zentralflorida bestand wahrscheinlich aus Überschwemmungs- und Auengebieten mit einem Mosaik von Wäldern mit geschlossenem Kronendach, offenerem Waldland und offenen Grasflächen., Die ersten Knochen der Art wurden 1983 als erste Funde auf dem amerikanischen Doppelkontinent der Art \\"Megantereon hesperus\\" zugeordnet. 2013 erfolgte aufgrund neuer Funde eine Revision der Zuordnung sowie die wissenschaftliche Erstbeschreibung von \\"Rhizosmilodon fiteae\\" als eigene Art innerhalb der ebenfalls neuen Gattung \\"Rhizosmilodon\\"., Merkmale., Die Beschreibung von \\"Rhizosmilodon fiteae\\" als eigenständige Art erfolgte auf der Basis mehrerer Gebissfragmente, zudem wurden der Art Überreste mehrerer Extremitätenknochen zugeordnet, die vom gleichen Fundort stammen., Merkmale der Zähne und Gebissfragmente., Der Holotypus UF 124634 (UF steht für Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, Gainesville, und benennt den Aufbewahrungsort der Fossilien) ist ein Teil des rechten Unterkiefers mit erhaltener Symphyse sowie dem Eckzahn (C1) und dem ersten Mahlzahn (M1); zwischen diesen sind die Zahnfächer (Alveolen) der Prämolaren P3 und P4 vorhanden, die Zähne selbst fehlen. Als Paratypus UF 135626 wurde ein Bruchstück des linken Unterkiefers mit erhaltenen Prämolaren P3 und P4 sowie dem Backenzahn M1 ausgewählt. Neben diesen beiden Unterkieferteilen wurden der Art weitere Fundstücke der gleichen Fundstelle zugeordnet. Dabei handelt es sich vor allem um einige weitere Unterkieferbruchstücke mit Zähnen und teilweise erhaltenen Symphysen- und Zahnfächerteilen (UF 22890, UF 223796, UF 212381, UF 272337)., Als diagnostische Merkmale der Art werden anhand der verfügbaren Fragmente zahlreiche Merkmale der vorhandenen Zähne und einzelne der Unterkieferknochen angegeben. So ist die Symphyse des Unterkiefers fast vertikal ausgeprägt und der Unterkiefer besitzt eine leichte Einbuchtung als Anpassung an die stark verlängerten Eckzähne des Oberkiefers. Die Schneidezähne sind klein, jedoch nicht liegend. Zumindest die unteren Eckzähne sind groß, jedoch seitlich deutlich abgeflacht; sie besitzen eine moderate, abgerundete Zähnung. Der zweite Vormahlzahn (P2) fehlt, P3 ist verlängert, jedoch nur etwa zwei Drittel so groß wie der letzte Prämolar (P4), der klingenartig vergrößert ist; P3 und P4 sind dabei nicht verbunden und stehen nicht in einer Line und auch P4 liegt nicht in einer direkten Linie mit dem ersten Mahlzahn (M1). Typisch erscheint die Anordnung der Höcker auf den Zahnkronen der Prämolaren und Molaren. So fehlt P3 der vordere Zahnhöcker und der hintere Zahnhöcker ist nur leicht ausgeformt. Auch der vordere Zahnhöcker auf P4 ist klein. Der erste Mahlzahn ist ähnlich kräftig wie der von \\"Smilodon\\"., Merkmale der Gliedmaßenknochen., Neben den beschriebenen Teilen der Kiefer wurden mehrere Knochen und Teile der Gliedmaßen aufgrund ihrer Größe der Art zugeordnet, obwohl sie nicht direkt mit den Kieferfragmenten gefunden wurden. Es handelt sich um einen vollständigen linken Oberschenkelknochen (UF 133938), das untere (distale) Ende eines rechten Oberschenkelknochens (UF 65686), das distale Stück einer linken Speiche (UF123836), ein vollständiges linkes Schienbein (Tibia) (UF 133939) sowie das obere (proximale) Stück eines rechten Schienbeins (UF212380)., Für die Erstbeschreibung von \\"Rhizosmilodon fiteae\\" wurden nur die beiden Oberschenkelknochen genauer beschrieben. Als arttypisch gelten vor allem die ausgeprägte Verlängerung des Mittelteiles der Gelenkknorren (Epikondylen) und der sehr gerade ausgeprägte Pectoralgrat, der nicht zu dem typisch gebogenen Deltoidgrat der meisten \\"Panthera\\"-Arten passt und eine Zuordnung zu den Säbelzahnkatzen zulässt. Weitere Details der Knochen wie der gebogene Schaft und der insgesamt kräftige Aufbau der Knochen sowie der Aufbau der Gelenkknorren und Foramina lassen auf eine verwandtschaftliche Nähe zu \\"Smilodon\\" schließen. Die Existenz einer weiteren, noch unbeschriebenen nahe verwandten Art neben \\"Rhizosmilodon fiteae\\" aus der Fundgegend, zu der diese Knochen gehören könnten, wird als unwahrscheinlich angenommen., Merkmalsrekonstruktion., Obwohl von \\"Rhizosmilodon fiteae\\" nur wenige Skelettbestandteile bekannt sind, ist eine relativ fundierte Rekonstruktion des gesamten Tieres möglich. Die Paläontologen profitieren in diesem Fall stark von den Arten, die in die nähere Verwandtschaft eingeordnet werden, also vor allem von bekannten Säbelzahnkatzen sowie auch von heute lebenden Katzen ähnlicher Größe und Statur. Über einen Merkmalsvergleich können viele Merkmale als Plesiomorphien, also bereits in der gemeinsamen Stammart vorhandene Merkmale, vorausgesetzt werden – darunter vor allem die Haltung und Gestaltung der Gliedmaßen sowie der allgemeine Körperbau und die Körperhaltung., Auf der Basis der vorhandenen Oberschenkel- und Schienbeinknochen konnte eine Hochrechnung auf das Gewicht der Katze gemacht werden, indem die Knochen mit denen heute lebender und ausgestorbener Katzen verglichen wurden. Nach dieser Abschätzung erreichte \\"Rhizosmilodon fiteae\\" ein Gewicht von etwa 56 bis 85Kilogramm und entsprach damit etwa einem heute lebenden Puma (\\"Puma concolor\\") oder Jaguar (\\"Panthera onca\\"). Die Größe überlappt sich zudem mit den Abschätzungen für den ausgestorbenen kleineren \\"Smilodon gracilis\\"., Merkmale im Vergleich mit anderen Arten., Da \\"Rhizosmilodon fiteae\\" als eigenständige Art und Gattung beschrieben wurde, mussten in der Erstbeschreibung die vorhandenen und rekonstruierten Merkmale mit anderen potenziell nahe verwandten Arten und Gattungen abgeglichen werden, um die Eigenständigkeit zu belegen und eine phylogenetische Zuordnung abzuleiten., Die Zuordnung zu den Smilodontini, zu denen neben \\"Rhizosmilodon\\" auch die Gattungen \\"Smilodon\\" und \\"Megantereon\\" gestellt werden, basiert auf der Zähnung der Schneidflächen der Eckzähne, die bei Vertretern der Machairodontini alle Zähne betrifft. Auch die vertikale Unterkiefersymphyse sowie die Stellung der Zähne P3, P4 und M1 zueinander sowie die Ausbildung der einzelnen Zähne ermöglichen die Zuordnung in diese Verwandtschaft. Von den Gattungen \\"Smilodon\\" und \\"Megantereon\\" unterscheidet sich \\"Rhizosmilodon\\" allerdings durch eigenständige Merkmale. Dies sind ebenfalls spezifische Zahnmerkmale wie die konkret moderate und abgerundete Ausprägung der Zähnung am unteren Eckzahn. Diese ist auch bei \\"Smilodon gracilis\\" vorhanden, bei anderen Arten von \\"Smilodon\\" (\\"Smilodon fatalis\\", \\"Smilodon popular\\") jedoch deutlich ausgeprägter; bei \\"Megantereon\\" fehlt die Zähnung dagegen und ist wahrscheinlich verloren gegangen. Auch die Unterkiefereinbuchtung als Anpassung an die vergrößerten Eckzähne des Oberkiefers ist im Vergleich zu \\"Smilodon\\" nur leicht ausgeprägt. Weitere Merkmale mit deutlichen Unterschieden betreffen die Ausbildung der Zahnhöcker auf den Prämolaren und Molaren., Fundort und zeitliche Einordnung., Die Fossilien zur Erstbeschreibung stammen aus einer Phosphatmine bei Fort Meade im Polk County in Zentral-Florida, weitere Funde aus den angrenzenden Regionen im Hardee und Hillsborough County. Die fossiltragenden Schichten dieser Region werden der Upper Bone Valley Formation in Florida zugeordnet, die darin enthaltenen Tiere der sogenannten Palmetto-Fauna und der Whidden Creek Local Fauna. Diese wird zeitlich in das späte Hemphillium eingeordnet, einer Periode der nordamerikanischen Säugetierfauna, die sich mit dem frühen Pliozän, dem Zancleum, überlappt. Die in dieser Schicht enthaltenen Fossilien werden auf ein Alter von etwa fünf Millionen Jahren geschätzt., Während die meisten fossilen Überreste von Wirbeltieren in der Upper Bone Valley Formation an isolierten Fundorten aufgesammelt werden und eine gezielte Suche nach weiteren Fossilien nicht lohnenswert ist, stellt die Mine der Gardinier Inc. bei Fort Meade eine Ausnahme dar. Seit 1989 konnten in dieser Mine tausende Wirbeltierfossilien in einer nur etwa 0,8Meter dicken Schicht auf einer Fläche von etwa 2000 Quadratmetern, der größten bekannten Fossilkonzentration in dem Gebiet, gefunden werden., Lebensweise und Paläoökologie., Über die Lebensweise und Ökologie der Gattung liegen keine Daten vor, allerdings lässt sie sich ähnlich wie bei anderen fossilen Großkatzen durch einen Vergleich mit rezenten Arten rekonstruieren. Wie andere Säbelzahnkatzen wird auch \\"Rhizosmilodon\\" ein Fleischfresser gewesen sein, der wahrscheinlich aktiv seine Beute jagte und tötete. Dabei handelte es sich entsprechend seiner Größe wahrscheinlich um kleinere bis mittelgroße Säugetiere, das Beutespektrum ähnelte dem des rezenten Puma (\\"Puma concolor\\"). Möglich ist, dass \\"Rhizosmilodon\\" durch seine vergleichsweise geringe Größe auf Bäume klettern und seine Beute so vor größeren Raubtieren oder Rudeln verstecken konnte., Die Zusammensetzung der Palmetto-Fauna lässt auf ein Vorkommen der Art an der Meeresküste schließen. In den Fossilschichten sind neben Landwirbeltieren zahlreiche Fossilien von Meereslebewesen wie Knorpelfische, Knochenfische, Schildkröten und Wale enthalten.

Индивидуальный подход: Небольшие банки обычно предлагают более гибкие условия обслуживания и более персонализированный подход к клиентам. Они могут предложить индивидуальное консультирование и помощь в развитии бизнеса, что может быть полезно для предпринимателей, особенно начинающих. 2. Быстрые решения: В небольших банках решения по кредитованию и другим банковским услугам могут приниматься быстрее, поскольку они не имеют таких сложных процедур, как большие банки. Это может быть полезно для предпринимателей, нуждающихся в быстрых финансовых решениях. 3. Низкие комиссии: Небольшие банки могут предлагать более конкурентные тарифы и низкие комиссии на обслуживание счетов и другие банковские услуги. Это может сэкономить деньги предпринимателям и уменьшить их операционные расходы. 4. Лучшая доступность: Небольшие банки часто имеют меньшую очередь и быстрее обслуживают клиентов. Возможность быстрого доступа к банковским услугам может быть особенно важна для предпринимателей, у которых закрученный график работы. 5. Больший контроль: В небольших банках предприниматели могут получить больший контроль над своими финансами и счетами. Они могут легче установить персональные контакты с работниками банка и получить дополнительную поддержку по управлению счетами и финансами своего бизнеса. Однако стоит учитывать, что небольшие банки могут иметь ограниченную географическую покрытие и меньший список доступных банковских продуктов и услуг. Поэтому перед выбором банка предпринимателям стоит тщательно изучить все предложения и сравнить их с другими банками, чтобы найти наиболее выгодное решение для своего бизнеса."},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Orphik, Vegetarismus], Die Orphiker () waren eine religiöse Strömung der Antike, die sich ab dem 6./5.Jahrhundert v.Chr. oder schon früher in Griechenland, im griechisch besiedelten Süditalien und an der nördlichen Schwarzmeerküste ausbreitete. Sie beriefen sich auf den mythischen Sänger und Dichter Orpheus, in dem sie den Urheber ihrer Lehren und den Autor maßgeblicher orphischer Texte sahen. Ihr Bestreben war die Vorbereitung auf das von ihnen erwartete Fortleben der Seele nach dem Tod des Körpers. Bei der Orphik handelte es sich aber nicht um eine einheitliche Religionsgemeinschaft mit einer in sich geschlossenen Lehre, sondern um eine Vielzahl von autonomen Gruppen., Entstehung und Frühzeit., Die Orphik stammte vermutlich aus Thrakien, das als Heimat des Orpheus galt und von den Griechen als Barbarenland betrachtet wurde. Sie verbreitete sich in Griechenland – mit Schwerpunkten in Nordgriechenland und auf Kreta –, in den von griechischen Siedlern kolonisierten Gebieten Süditaliens und an der griechisch besiedelten Schwarzmeerküste. Eindeutig bezeugt ist orphisches Gedankengut erst im 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr., doch können die Anfänge viel früher liegen., Die in der Forschung diskutierten Erklärungsansätze für die Entstehung und frühe Entwicklung sind spekulativ. Unklar ist insbesondere das Verhältnis der Orphik zu verwandten Phänomenen innerhalb der griechischen Religion wie dem Pythagoreismus, den eleusinischen Mysterien, verschiedenen Erscheinungsformen des Dionysos-Kults und der religiösen Philosophie des Vorsokratikers Empedokles. Im 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr. berichtete Herodot vom Verbot der Beisetzung in wollener Kleidung, einer Begräbnisvorschrift, die bakchisch (dionysisch) und orphisch genannt werde. Empedokles, der ebenfalls im 5. Jahrhundert lebte, scheint sich als Orphiker betrachtet zu haben; einer Forschungshypothese zufolge ging er in seiner Dichtung nicht nur inhaltlich von orphischen Ideen aus, sondern lehnte sich auch formal an ein orphisches Vorbild an. Manche Ziele und Überzeugungen teilten die Orphiker mit den Pythagoreern, einer religiösen Gemeinschaft, die Pythagoras im 6. Jahrhundert v. Chr. in Süditalien gegründet hatte. Der Schriftsteller und Dichter Ion von Chios (5. Jahrhundert v. Chr.) behauptet, Pythagoras habe Gedichte, die er selbst schrieb, als Werke des Orpheus ausgegeben. Nach späteren Berichten gehörten in Italien lebende Pythagoreer zu den Autoren orphischen Schrifttums. Gegenseitige Beeinflussung von Orphikern und Pythagoreern ist wohl anzunehmen. Entsprechende Hypothesen werden in der Forschung seit langem erörtert, doch erlaubt die ungünstige Quellenlage keine gesicherten Aussagen darüber, denn eindeutige Belege fehlen. Jedenfalls lassen die vorliegenden Berichte erkennen, dass die frühen Orphiker eine Protest- und Reformbewegung waren, die sich elitär von der Volksreligion abgrenzte und daher von ihrer Umwelt skeptisch betrachtet wurde. Im Gegensatz zu den Pythagoreern sind bei den Orphikern keine politischen Zielsetzungen erkennbar., Orpheus, der angebliche Urheber der Orphik, wurde schon im 6. Jahrhundert v. Chr. zu den Argonauten gezählt, also eine Generation vor dem Trojanischen Krieg datiert. Ob es für diese mythische Gestalt ein reales historisches Vorbild gab und ob die Orpheus-Sage einen historischen Kern hat, ist unbekannt. In der Forschung gehen die Meinungen darüber auseinander., Orphische Schriften., Die reichhaltige Buchproduktion der Orphik, die schon für das 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr. bezeugt ist, hielt bis in die Spätantike an. Charakteristisch für die Orphiker ist einerseits ihre hohe Wertschätzung ihrer Bücher und andererseits der Umstand, dass sie ihre Lehrtexte anscheinend nicht in einer bestimmten Fassung dauerhaft als verbindlich fixierten, sondern immer wieder neu formulierten und auslegten. Es handelt sich hauptsächlich um mythische Schilderungen der Weltentstehung (Kosmogonie) und Hymnen., Die orphische Dichtung, das Schrifttum der Orphiker in Versform, als dessen Autor gewöhnlich Orpheus selbst galt, ist größtenteils verloren. Eine Anzahl von Gedichten liegt vollständig vor, ein anderer Teil der orphischen Dichtung ist nur bruchstückhaft erhalten oder aus Inhaltsangaben bekannt, von manchen Werken sind nur die Titel überliefert. Die Suda, eine byzantinische Enzyklopädie, nennt eine Reihe von Titeln. Diese Liste stammt wohl aus einer verlorenen, in der Epoche des Hellenismus von dem Grammatiker Epigenes verfassten Abhandlung über die orphischen Dichtungen. Das Versmaß der orphischen Dichtung ist immer der Hexameter., Vollständig erhalten ist eine Sammlung von orphischen Hymnen. Es handelt sich um 87 Gedichte, deren Umfang zwischen sechs und dreißig Versen schwankt. Darin verherrlicht Orpheus als fiktiver Verfasser die von den Orphikern verehrten Gottheiten. Vermutlich wurden diese Dichtungen im 2. Jahrhundert für eine kleinasiatische Kultgemeinschaft geschaffen, vielleicht mit Verwertung älteren Materials., Nur fragmentarisch überliefert oder aus Inhaltszusammenfassungen bekannt sind folgende Dichtungen:, Der Derveni-Papyrus, eine 1962 in der Grabstätte A der Derveni-Gräber bei Thessaloniki aufgefundene Schriftrolle, enthält Fragmente eines Kommentars zu einer ansonsten unbekannten Version des orphischen Schöpfungsmythos, aus welcher der Kommentator einzelne Verse zitiert, die er allegorisch auslegt. In dieser Version spielt Zeus als Schöpfer die Hauptrolle. Der Kommentator distanziert sich nachdrücklich von einem aus seiner Sicht verfehlten vordergründigen, buchstäblichen Textverständnis. Der Papyrus wurde im 4. Jahrhundert v. Chr. beschriftet, der Kommentar stammt aus dem späten 5. oder frühen 4. Jahrhundert v. Chr. und das kommentierte Gedicht dürfte noch wesentlich älter sein., Zu den verlorenen Schriften zählen die „Orakel“ \\"(chrēsmoí)\\", die „Weihen“ \\"(teletaí)\\", die „Mischkrüge“ \\"(kratḗres)\\", der „Mantel“ \\"(péplos)\\", das „Netz“ \\"(díktyon)\\", die „Physik“ (\\"physiká\\", über Kosmologie) und die „Sternkunde“ \\"(astrologiká)\\"., Lehren., Das Interesse der Orphiker richtete sich in erster Linie auf die Entstehung des Kosmos, der Götterwelt und der Menschheit und auf das Schicksal der Seele nach dem Tod. Ihre mythische und poetische Denk- und Ausdrucksweise bewirkte, dass ihre Lehren nicht in klarer, verbindlicher Form fixiert und dogmatisiert wurden, sondern einen fluktuierenden Charakter behielten und unterschiedlich interpretierbar waren., Kosmologie., Die orphische Kosmogonie (Weltentstehungslehre) macht in ihrer ältesten bekannten Version, die Eudemos von Rhodos aufzeichnete, die Nacht zum Anfang aller Dinge. Der Schöpfungsvorgang erstreckt sich nach der alten orphischen Dichtung über sechs Generationen, wie aus einem Zitat bei Platon hervorgeht, wonach Orpheus „die Ordnung des Gesangs“ mit dem sechsten Geschlecht enden lässt., Eine Gruppe anderer Versionen bietet verschiedene Varianten einer abweichenden Überlieferung des Mythos. Eine davon ist die von Damaskios wiedergegebene Fassung aus den „Heiligen Reden in 24 Rhapsodien“, daher spricht man von der „rhapsodischen Kosmogonie“ der Orphiker. In diesem Überlieferungszweig erscheint die Zeit (Chronos) als das Prinzip, das den Ursprung von allem bildet. Chronos bringt zunächst zwei Prinzipien hervor, Aither und Chaos. Die zweite Phase der kosmischen Geschichte beginnt mit der Entstehung des silbrig glänzenden Welteis, das Chronos im Aither erschafft. Aus dem Weltei wird der geflügelte Lichtgott Phanes geboren. Phanes ist eine Hauptgottheit der Orphiker, außerhalb orphischer Kreise scheint er nicht verehrt worden zu sein. Er wird in der spätantiken, vielleicht auch schon in der frühen Orphik mit Eros gleichgesetzt. Seine Gefährtin ist Nyx, die Nacht; ihr vertraut er sein Szepter an. Nyx gebiert den Gott Uranos, der als nächster die Welt regiert. Dies ist die dritte Phase. Uranos wird von seinem Sohn Kronos gestürzt; dieser Machtwechsel leitet die vierte Phase ein. Auf Kronos folgt Zeus, dessen Regierung die fünfte Phase bildet. Zeus verschlingt Phanes, womit er sich dessen gesamte Kraft und Macht aneignet. Mit seiner Mutter zeugt er die Tochter Persephone, mit Persephone den Sohn Dionysos. Später überlässt Zeus die Herrschaft dem noch kindlichen Dionysos, womit die sechste Phase beginnt. Gegen Dionysos stachelt Hera, die eifersüchtige Gattin des Zeus, die Titanen auf. Die Titanen locken Dionysos in eine Falle, töten und zerstückeln ihn. Dann kochen sie seinen Leichnam und beginnen ihn zu verzehren, wodurch sie etwas von seinem Wesen in sich aufnehmen. Zeus überrascht die Mörder jedoch und verbrennt sie mit seinem Blitz zu Asche. Aus der Asche, in der Titanisches mit Dionysischem gemischt ist, steigt Rauch auf und es bildet sich Ruß; daraus erschafft Zeus das Menschengeschlecht. Damit erklärt eine Variante des Mythos die Ambivalenz der menschlichen Natur, die zwei gegensätzliche Tendenzen aufweist: einerseits einen zerstörerischen, titanischen Zug, der zur Rebellion gegen die göttliche Ordnung anstachelt, andererseits aber auch ein dionysisches Element, das zum Göttlichen hinführt. Apollon sammelt die Stücke von Dionysos’ Leichnam ein, Athene bringt sein intaktes Herz zu Zeus, der nunmehr den Ermordeten zu neuem Leben erweckt., Eine weitere Version gibt Damaskios mit Berufung auf zwei Autoren namens Hieronymos und Hellanikos wieder. Ihr zufolge gab es anfangs zwei Prinzipien, das Wasser als Prinzip der Zerstreuung und die Erde als Prinzip der Zusammenfügung. Aus ihnen ist als drittes Prinzip ein Drache hervorgegangen, der zugleich den Namen des nicht alternden Chronos (Zeit) und des Herakles trägt. Dieses Wesen trägt Flügel auf den Schultern und ist dreiköpfig; neben einem Stier- und einem Löwenkopf hat es in der Mitte einen göttlichen. Seine Gefährtin ist Ananke, die weltumfassende Notwendigkeit. Chronos ist der Vater von Aither und Chaos. Später erzeugt Chronos aus Aither, Chaos und Erebos (der Finsternis) das Weltei. Nach einer anderen Variante dieser Version des Mythos, die der christliche Apologet Athenagoras von Athen überliefert, war das Wasser das alleinige Urprinzip; aus ihm bildete sich das Erdelement als Schlamm. Nach Athenagoras’ Darstellung spaltete sich das Weltei in zwei Teile; aus dem oberen entstand der Himmel, aus dem unteren die Erde., Seelenlehre., Schon in den homerischen Epen ist die Auffassung anzutreffen, im menschlichen und tierischen Dasein gebe es ein belebendes Prinzip, dessen Anwesenheit Voraussetzung: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Orphik, Vegetarismus, religiöse Strömung, Antike, Orpheus, Lehrtexte, Schriften, Hymnen, Kosmogonie, Lehren, Kosmologie"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Geboren 164, Gestorben 218, Herrscher (3. Jahrhundert), Kaiser (Rom), Mann, Pontifex, Prätorianerpräfekt], Marcus Opellius Macrinus (* 164 in Caesarea Mauretaniae; † Juni/Juli 218 in Archelaïs, heute Aksaray) war römischer Kaiser vom 11. April 217 bis zum 8. Juni 218. Als Kaiser nannte er sich \\"Marcus Opellius Severus Macrinus\\"., Der Nordafrikaner Macrinus war der erste Kaiser, der bei seinem Regierungsantritt nicht dem Senatorenstand angehörte. Er begann seine Karriere in Rom unter Kaiser Septimius Severus (193–211). Unter dessen Sohn und Nachfolger Caracalla (211–217) stieg er 212 zum Prätorianerpräfekten auf und begleitete den Kaiser 216–217 auf dessen Feldzug gegen die Parther. Er organisierte ein Mordkomplott, dem Caracalla am 8. April 217 im nördlichen Mesopotamien zum Opfer fiel. Es gelang ihm, seine Beteiligung an dem Anschlag vor den Soldaten zu verheimlichen. Nach einigem Zögern erhob ihn das Heer zum Nachfolger des Ermordeten., Im Senat stieß Macrinus trotz seiner senatsfreundlichen Politik auf beträchtliche Vorbehalte, insbesondere weil er nicht der senatorischen Reichsaristokratie (Nobilität) angehörte. Als Kaiser kam er nie nach Rom, sondern verbrachte seine gesamte kurze Regierungszeit im Osten des Reichs. Den Angriffskrieg seines Vorgängers gegen die Parther musste er zunächst fortsetzen, wobei er eine empfindliche Niederlage erlitt. Schließlich erkaufte er 218 den Frieden. Mit seiner Sparsamkeit machte er sich bei den Soldaten unbeliebt. Bald nach dem Beginn seines zweiten Regierungsjahrs führte die Unzufriedenheit im Heer zu seinem Sturz. Anhänger der entmachteten Dynastie der Severer erhoben Elagabal, der als unehelicher Sohn Caracallas ausgegeben wurde, zum Gegenkaiser. Am 8. Juni 218 unterlagen die Truppen des Macrinus der Streitmacht Elagabals. Macrinus wurde auf der Flucht gefasst und bald darauf getötet., Leben., Herkunft und Karriere., Macrinus wurde 164 geboren. Er stammte aus Caesarea, der Hauptstadt der Provinz Mauretania Caesariensis, die sich in der Nähe der heutigen algerischen Stadt Cherchell befand. Macrinus war römischer Ritter. Vielleicht gehörten schon seine unbekannten Eltern dem Ritterstand an; es kann aber auch sein, dass erst ihm selbst der Ritterrang verliehen wurde. Erst in der spätantiken Geschichtsschreibung sind Einzelheiten über seinen angeblichen Aufstieg aus äußerst armseligen Verhältnissen überliefert, die aber unglaubwürdig sind. Es handelt sich offenbar um Verleumdungen, mit denen man ihn in aristokratischen Kreisen als unwürdigen Emporkömmling diskreditieren wollte. Der zeitgenössische Geschichtsschreiber Cassius Dio teilt nur mit, dass Macrinus Maure war und sein Elternhaus „sehr bescheiden“ war. Da Macrinus die für seine spätere Laufbahn erforderliche Ausbildung erhielt, war seine Familie wohl nicht mittellos und bildungsfern., In Rom war Macrinus als Jurist tätig. Dabei kam er mit dem mächtigen Prätorianerpräfekten Plautianus in Kontakt, der ebenfalls aus Nordafrika stammte. Plautianus machte ihn zum Verwalter seines riesigen Vermögens. Als Plautianus 205 durch eine Intrige gestürzt und auf Befehl des Kaisersohns Caracalla getötet wurde, geriet auch Macrinus in große Gefahr, doch der Stadtpräfekt Lucius Fabius Cilo trat für ihn ein und rettete ihm damit das Leben. Nun begann er die ritterliche Ämterlaufbahn. Erst war er \\"advocatus fisci\\" (Anwalt des Fiscus), dann machte ihn Kaiser Septimius Severus zum \\"praefectus vehiculorum per Flaminiam\\", übertrug ihm also die Aufsicht über den Wagenverkehr auf der Via Flaminia. Schließlich vertraute ihm Kaiser Caracalla im Jahre 212 die hohe Stellung eines der beiden Prätorianerpräfekten an. Damit erreichte er den Gipfel der ritterlichen Karriereleiter. Er hatte nun eine der mächtigsten Positionen im Reich inne. 216–217 begleitete er Caracalla auf dessen Feldzug gegen die Parther., Erhebung zum Kaiser., Die Umstände, die zum Tod Caracallas und zu Macrinus’ Erhebung zum Kaiser führten, schildert Cassius Dio ausführlich. Die Grundzüge seines Berichts werden in der Forschung meist als zutreffend betrachtet; in modernen Darstellungen der Vorgänge werden sie gewöhnlich übernommen. Dieser Überlieferung zufolge befand sich Macrinus im Frühjahr 217 in einer akuten Notlage: Prophezeiungen hatten ihm die Kaiserwürde verheißen, und dies war Caracalla zu Ohren gekommen; außerdem war ein schriftlicher Bericht über eine solche Wahrsagung an den Kaiser unterwegs. Ulpius Julianus, ein Vertrauensmann des Macrinus, den dieser später zum Prätorianerpräfekten ernannte, warnte Macrinus vor der drohenden Lebensgefahr. Die Verbreitung der Prophezeiung war vermutlich Teil einer gegen den Prätorianerpräfekten gerichteten Intrige. In der dadurch entstandenen Situation musste Macrinus eine existenzielle Bedrohung sehen, da Caracalla alles, was seine Herrschaft zu gefährden schien, tödlich ernst nahm. Um seiner Festnahme und Beseitigung zuvorzukommen, organisierte Macrinus die Ermordung Caracallas, wobei er sich einer Gruppe von drei Unzufriedenen bediente. Am 8. April 217 wurde das Attentat im nördlichen Mesopotamien ausgeführt. Zweifel an der Rolle des Macrinus als Organisator der Verschwörung, die in der Forschung vereinzelt geäußert worden sind, werden von den meisten Historikern für unberechtigt gehalten., Da Caracalla keine Kinder hatte, war mit ihm die männliche Nachkommenschaft des Dynastiegründers Septimius Severus ausgestorben. Dies bedeutete das vorläufige Ende der Herrschaft der Severer. Das zum Partherkrieg versammelte Heer, dem die Wahl des neuen Kaisers oblag, war der Dynastie ergeben, musste sich nun aber für einen dynastiefremden Nachfolger Caracallas entscheiden. Offenbar konnte Macrinus seine Beteiligung an dem Attentat verheimlichen, doch fand er zunächst kaum Unterstützung. Nach dem Bericht des zeitgenössischen Geschichtsschreibers Herodian zogen ihm die Soldaten seinen Kollegen vor, den anderen Prätorianerpräfekten Marcus Oclatinius Adventus, obwohl dieser schon betagt war, kaum noch sehen und weder lesen noch schreiben konnte. Im Gegensatz zum Juristen Macrinus, der keine soldatischen Leistungen vorzuweisen hatte, galt er aber als militärisch bewährt. Erst nachdem er mit dem Hinweis auf sein Alter die Kaiserwürde abgelehnt hatte, ließen sich die Soldaten überreden, Macrinus am 11. April zum Kaiser auszurufen. Dieser nahm seine Erhebung scheinbar nur widerstrebend an, wie es dem Brauch der \\"recusatio imperii\\" entsprach. Mit seinem Kaisernamen \\"Marcus Opellius Severus Macrinus\\" knüpfte er demonstrativ an die severische Tradition an., Verhältnis zum Senat., Macrinus war der erste Kaiser in der römischen Geschichte, der zum Zeitpunkt seiner Erhebung nicht dem Senatorenstand angehörte, sondern Ritter war. Zwar hatte er von Caracalla Anfang 217 die \\"ornamenta consularia\\" (Rangabzeichen eines Konsulars) und den Titel \\"vir clarissimus\\" („hochangesehener Mann“), der eigentlich Angehörigen des Senatorenstandes vorbehalten war, erhalten, doch war damit höchstwahrscheinlich keine Aufnahme in den Senat verbunden. Solche Ehrungen stellten zwar eine Rangerhöhung dar, aber sie bedeuteten nicht, dass der Geehrte einen Sitz im Senat einnahm und tatsächlich Konsular war, also einem Senator, der als Konsul amtiert hatte, gleichgestellt war. Dies bestätigte Macrinus selbst, indem er das Konsulat, das er im Jahr 218 als Kaiser antrat, als sein erstes betrachtete. Staatsrechtlich stellte seine Erhebung einen wichtigen Präzedenzfall dar; fortan galt die Zugehörigkeit zum Senatorenstand nicht mehr als zwingend notwendige Voraussetzung für die Erlangung der Kaiserwürde., Da Caracalla bei vielen Senatoren verhasst gewesen war, wurde sein Tod im Senat mit Befriedigung zur Kenntnis genommen. Unter diesen Umständen konnte sein dynastiefremder Nachfolger in senatorischen Kreisen von vornherein mit einem gewissen Wohlwollen rechnen, obwohl er aus senatorischer Sicht nicht für die Kaiserwürde qualifiziert war. Die Senatoren registrierten mit Genugtuung, dass sich der neue Herrscher intensiv um ihre Unterstützung bemühte. Beispielsweise bekannte er sich zu dem Grundsatz, dass eine Verhängung der Todesstrafe gegen einen Senator ohne Zustimmung des Senats nicht in Betracht komme. Cassius Dio, der aus senatorischer Perspektive urteilte, brachte diese mit Einschränkungen wohlwollende Haltung in seinem Geschichtswerk zum Ausdruck. Er sparte aber auch nicht mit Tadel für Maßnahmen des Macrinus, die er für verfehlt und für Verstöße gegen traditionelle Vorrechte der Senatoren hielt., Grundsätzlich herrschte in senatorischen Kreisen die Auffassung, dass Macrinus wegen seiner Herkunft und mangelnden Zugehörigkeit zum Senatorenstand nicht nach der Kaiserwürde hätte greifen dürfen. Nach Cassius Dios Überzeugung wäre es vielmehr seine Pflicht gewesen, den eigenen Ehrgeiz hintanzustellen und seine Autorität als Prätorianerpräfekt zu nutzen, um für die Kaisererhebung eines Senators zu sorgen. Dennoch bestand eine gewisse Bereitschaft, über diese als Usurpation betrachtete Anmaßung hinwegzusehen, sofern sich der neue Herrscher eingedenk seiner Herkunft bescheiden benahm und die Erwartungen der senatorischen Führungsschicht erfüllte. Schwer verübelt wurde ihm jedoch, dass seine Regierungstätigkeit darauf wenig Rücksicht nahm., Einen argen Fehltritt beging Macrinus aus senatorischer Sicht schon unmittelbar nach seinem Herrschaftsantritt: In dem Brief, in dem er dem Senat seine Erhebung anzeigte, führte er bereits die kaiserliche Titulatur, ohne die Bestätigung seiner neuen Würde durch den Senat abzuwarten. Faktisch war diese Bestätigung zwar reine Formsache, doch missachtete Macrinus mit seinem Verhalten ein Vorrecht des Senats. Als Missgriff wurde auch gewertet, dass er gegen Personen vorging, die er verdächtigte, seine Herrschaft wegen seiner Herkunft als illegitim zu betrachten, statt sich um das Wohlwollen dieser Oppositionellen zu bemühen. Zu heftiger Kritik gab seine Personalpolitik Anlass. Dazu gehörte die Ernennung von Emporkömmlingen zu Provinzstatthaltern, obwohl sie aus der Sicht der Kritiker über keine entsprechende Qualifikation verfügten. Besonders anstößig war die Ernennung des Adventus, der Macrinus durch seine Ablehnung der Kaisererhebung zur Macht verholfen hatte, zum Stadtpräfekten. Dass Macrinus dieses sehr bedeutende senatorische Amt in der Hauptstadt einem ungebildeten Mann mit soldatischer Vergangenheit anvertraute, der noch nicht in den Senat aufgenommen war, stellte für die Senatoren eine schwerwiegende Provokation dar.

Er hinterließ eine womöglich bis heute noch nicht in vollem Umfang erfasste Zahl von Übersetzungen antiker, insbesondere griechischer Autoren ins Spanische sowie zum Teil unter Pseudonym verfasste selbständige Schriften., Leben und Wirken., Herkunft., Francisco de Enzinas, der sich selbst auch Dryander nannte, kam laut Aussage eines Zeitgenossen am 1.November 1518 in Burgos, Spanien, zur Welt (so 2004 das \\"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\\", ältere biographische Quellen sagen 1520). Sein Vater Juan de Enzinas war ein erfolgreicher und wohlhabender Kaufmann. Die Mutter Ana starb früh (wohl 1527) und der Vater heiratete 1528– da war Francisco 10 Jahre alt– ein zweites Mal, eine Beatriz de Santa Cruz (ca. 1495 bis ca. 1573), die einer einflussreichen Familie aus Burgos entstammte und die internationalen Beziehungen, die sich in der Folgezeit gepflegt wurden, in die Ehe einbrachte. Zur Verwandtschaft gehörte der Theologe Pedro de Lerma (1461–1541), der erste Kanzler der Universität Alcalá. Ein Onkel Franciscos, Don Pedro de Enzinas, war Archidiakon von Palenzuela und veranlasste 1566 den Bau einer Kapelle in der Kirche San Gil in Burgos, die neben dem sogenannten \\"Cristo de Burgos\\" auch die Grabmäler einiger Mitglieder der Familie Enzinas beherbergt., Werdegang., Durch seine verwandtschaftlichen Beziehungen kam Francisco de Enzinas bereits in jungen Jahren in die Niederlande. In den Matrikeln der Universität Löwen taucht er 1539 auf. Hier lernte er u.a. Albert Ritzaeus Hardenberg kennen und wurde mit den Schriften und Ideen von Erasmus und Luther, wahrscheinlich auch mit denen Philipp Melanchthons, erstmals vertraut. Einer seiner Brüder, Diego de Enzinas, studierte mit ihm am \\"Collegium Trilingue\\" in Löwen und betreute 1542 in Antwerpen den Druck zweier Texte mit dem Titel \\"Breve y compendiosa institución de la religión cristiana\\": einen \\"Katechismus\\" von Johannes Calvin, den Francisco ins Spanische übersetzt hatte, und die spanische Fassung von Luthers \\"Von der Freiheit eines Christenmenschen\\". Diego starb 1547 in Rom auf dem Scheiterhaufen., Im Sommer 1541 reiste Francisco de Enzinas nach Paris, um seinen Verwandten Pedro de Lerma, unterdessen Dekan der theologischen Fakultät an der Sorbonne, zu besuchen, der im August desselben Jahres verstarb. Am 27.Oktober 1541 immatrikulierte er sich in Wittenberg und setzte sein Studium des Griechischen fort bei Philipp Melanchthon., Haft., Möglicherweise hatte Francisco de Enzinas bereits in Löwen damit begonnen, das Neue Testament aus dem Griechischen ins Spanische zu übersetzen; in Wittenberg wohnte er im Hause Melanchthons, der das Vorhaben ausgesprochen unterstützte, und stellte die Übersetzung bis Ende 1542 fertig. Mit der für den Druck vorbereiteten Fassung reiste er im Winter 1542/43 in die Niederlande, wo er eher als in Wittenberg einen Drucker fürs Spanische finden konnte und die Vertriebswege nach Spanien günstiger waren, da die Niederlande zum Hoheitsbereich Karls V. gehörten. Im Oktober 1543 wurde \\"El Nuevo Testamento de nuestro Redemptor y Salvador Jesu Christo\\" in Antwerpen gedruckt. Am 25.November 1543 gelang es Francisco de Enzinas– wiederum durch verwandtschaftliche Beziehungen–, ein Exemplar seiner gedruckten Übersetzung persönlich Kaiser Karl V. in Brüssel zu überreichen. Am 13.Dezember 1543 wurde er auf Veranlassung von Pedro de Soto, Dominikaner und Beichtvater des Kaisers, verhaftet und ins Brunta-Gefängnis in Brüssel überstellt, in dem er knapp anderthalb Jahre einsaß. Das \\"Nuevo Testamento\\" wurde konfisziert. Durch die Beziehungen seiner Familie wurde Enzinas zu einem diplomatischen Fall. Anfang 1545 konnte er fliehen, zunächst nach Antwerpen und von dort nach Wittenberg, wo er im März des Jahres wieder bei Melanchthon war. Auf dessen Bitte schrieb er dort in wenigen Monaten seine Erlebnisse in den Niederlanden auf und betitelte sie \\"Historia de statu Belgico et religione Hispanica\\". Er ließ sie zu seinen Lebzeiten nicht drucken., Leben auf Reisen., Im Laufe des Jahres 1545 erhielt Francisco de Enzinas in Wittenberg unter Androhung der Todesstrafe und der Konfiszierung seines Besitzes die Aufforderung des Kaisers, ins Gefängnis zurückzukehren; Francisco kümmerte sich daraufhin in Leipzig zunächst um seine Finanzen., Anfang 1546 erfuhr er aus Spanien, dass auf Betreiben des kaiserlichen Beichtvaters de Soto nicht nur sein Erbe eingefroren, sondern über seine Familie auch der Bann gesprochen werden solle, sofern Francisco sich nicht nach Italien begeben werde. Franciscos Freund Juan Díaz, Spanier und Protestant wie er, schlug ein Treffen in Nürnberg vor; am 27. März wurde Díaz in Neuburg an der Donau auf Betreiben des eigenen Bruders Alfonso ermordet., Im Sommer 1546 reiste Francisco de Enzinas nach Straßburg zu Martin Bucer und besuchte anschließend in Zürich Heinrich Bullinger, in St. Gallen Joachim Vadian, in Lindau Hieronymus Seiler und in Konstanz Ambrosius Blarer von Giersberg, bevor er sich in Basel immatrikulierte. Hier schrieb er einen Bericht über die Ermordung des Juan Díaz, der im selben Jahr unter dem Pseudonym von Díaz’ Begleiter und Zeugen der Tat erschien: \\"Historia vera de morti sancti viri Ioannis Diazii Hispani […] per Claudium Senarclaeum\\". Er ließ ein Traktat zum Trienter Konzil drucken, in dem er dieses Konzil, wie Eduard Böhmer (1893) bemerkt, „schneidig kritisiert“., Im Jahre 1547 unternahm Francisco de Enzinas eine weitere Reise durch die Schweiz und ließ im selben Jahr seine spanische Übersetzung von Plutarchs \\"Kimon und Lukullus\\" in Basel drucken. Dort erreichte ihn überdies die Nachricht, dass sein Bruder Diego in Rom als Ketzer verbrannt worden war. Er gab seinen Wohnsitz in Basel auf und zog nach Straßburg, da er sich in der Schweiz nicht mehr sicher fühlte. 1548 heiratete er in Straßburg Margarethe Elter (auch: Marguerite dElter). Obwohl de Enzinas über keinen formellen akademischen Abschluss verfügte, wurde er durch die Vermittlung von Bucer und Melanchthon als Regius Professor of Greek an die Universität Cambridge in England berufen. Im Oktober begann er dort mit dem Griechischunterricht, und seine Frau brachte ihr erstes Kind, eine Tochter namens Margarita, zur Welt., Francisco de Enzinas trieb in England seine Übersetzungen ins Spanische voran: Plutarch, Lukian, Livius. Nach gut einem Jahr verließ er seine kleine Familie, die er der Obhut des unterdessen ebenfalls in England niedergelassenen Bucer anvertraute, und reiste mit seinen Übersetzungen nach Basel, um sie dort bei Oporinus drucken zu lassen; er erhielt indes die dafür nötige obrigkeitliche Erlaubnis nicht. In Straßburg fand er einen Drucker, der 1550 mit dem Druck begann, so dass Enzinas beschloss, nicht mehr nach England zurückzukehren. Frau und Tochter kamen nach Straßburg. Francisco de Enzinas gründete dort einen Verlag für spanische Publikationen; 1551 wurde seine zweite Tochter Beatriz geboren., 1552 ereilte die Familie die in Straßburg heftig grassierende Pest. Francisco de Enzinas starb am 30. Dezember 1552, nur 34 Jahre alt; seine Frau erlag der Epidemie wenig später am 1. Februar 1553. Zurück blieben zwei kleine Töchter. Melanchthon bot sofort an, eins der Kinder bei sich aufzunehmen, auch die spanische Großmutter Beatriz kümmerte sich intensiv um das Sorgerecht. Gleichwohl blieben die Kinder in Straßburg, möglicherweise bei der dortigen Familie ihrer Mutter; es gibt aber auch Hinweise darauf, dass die Kinder in städtischer Obhut aufgewachsen sein könnten. Einige Quellen aus dem Sorgerechtsstreit mit Beatriz de Enzinas scheinen darauf hinzudeuten, dass die Mädchen später in Flandern lebten; was aus ihnen wurde, ist unbekannt., Quellenlage Vita., Francisco de Enzinas’ Leben ist seit dem 16. Jahrhundert in verstreuten biografischen Notizen überliefert, seit dem 19. Jahrhundert vor allem in Vorworten von Textausgaben oder in Veröffentlichungen zu spanischen Humanisten des 16. Jahrhunderts. Mit der Herausgabe seiner Korrespondenz im Jahre 1995, aus der einzelne Briefe als Quelle bereits im 19. Jahrhundert herangezogen worden waren, kamen diese als bedeutende Quelle hinzu. Die vorstehende Lebensbeschreibung basiert auf dem \\"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\\" und der dort verzeichneten Literatur, insbesondere der Darstellung von Eduard Böhmer, die umfangreiches Quellenmaterial nachweist. Der Abschnitt „Haft“ beruft sich auf Hedwig Böhmers Übersetzung der \\"Historia de statu Belgico\\". das heißt auf die autobiographischen Aussagen des Francisco de Enzinas., Werke., Von Francisco de Enzinas’ Werk hinterließen das \\"Nuevo Testamento\\" und seine zu Lebzeiten unveröffentlichte Schrift \\"Historia de statu Belgico et religione Hispanica\\" die nachhaltigsten Spuren., El Nuevo Testamento (1543)., Textzeugen., Der Antwerpener Druck von 1543 existiert in den Bibliotheken heute international durchweg als Microfiche oder Digitalisat; die meisten der wenigen nachgewiesenen Originaldrucke befinden sich in britischen Bibliotheken., Editionsgeschichte., Als Stephan Mierdman 1543 in Antwerpen den Auftrag Francisco de Enzinas’ annahm, die spanische Fassung des Neuen Testaments zu drucken, verstieß er gegen den Alleinanspruch der römischen Kirche auf die Heilige Schrift und deren Auslegung auf der Grundlage nur einer kanonisierten lateinischen Fassung, der Vulgata. Übersetzungen in die Landessprachen wurden im 16. Jahrhundert von der römischen Kirche nicht nur unterbunden, sondern auch verfolgt; sie galten als Ursache für die Ketzerei, die Kontrollen waren strikt. Martin Luther wäre bei seiner Übersetzung der Bibel ins Deutsche ohne seinen fürstlichen Schutz nicht unbehelligt geblieben. Dieses Verbot für unzulässig zu erklären, war eines der Motive der Reformation., Nach der Verhaftung de Enzinas’ 1543 wurde Mierdmans Druck des \\"Nuevo Testamento\\" auf Veranlassung der spanischen Kirche in den Niederlanden konfisziert und vernichtet. Gleichwohl blieben Exemplare übrig, wie aus der Korrespondenz de Enzinas’, u.a. mit dem Drucker Mierdman in Antwerpen während seines Aufenthalts in England 1549, hervorgeht. 1556, vier Jahre nach de Enzinas’ Tod, erschien anonym \\"El Testamento Nuevo de nuestro senor y salvador Iesu Christo.

Jahrhundert), Herrscher des Mittelalters], Richard Löwenherz (französisch, englisch ; * 8. September 1157 in Oxford; † 6. April 1199 in Châlus) war von 1189 bis zu seinem Tod als Richard I. König von England., Richards Lebensjahre bis zu seinem Regierungsantritt waren von Konflikten mit seinem Vater Heinrich II. und mit seinen Brüdern um das Erbe überschattet. Erst durch den Tod seines älteren Bruders Heinrich und ein Bündnis mit dem französischen König Philipp II. konnte er sich den englischen Königsthron sichern. Sein ererbter Herrschaftskomplex, das „angevinische Reich“, umfasste neben England die Normandie und weite Teile Westfrankreichs. Als Herrscher musste Richard ein wirtschaftlich und kulturell sehr heterogenes Konglomerat unterschiedlicher Territorien zusammenhalten. Während seiner Regierungszeit hielt er sich insgesamt nur sechs Monate in England auf., Auf einem gemeinsam mit Philipp unternommenen Kreuzzug, der heute als Dritter Kreuzzug gezählt wird, eroberte Richard 1191 Zypern. Dann setzte er ins Heilige Land über, wo er erfolgreich die bereits zwei Jahre andauernde Belagerung Akkons beendete. Das eigentliche Ziel des Unternehmens, die Rückeroberung Jerusalems, konnte jedoch nicht erreicht werden. Noch auf dem Kreuzzug kam es zwischen Richard und dem französischen König zum Zerwürfnis. Während seiner Rückkehr auf dem Landweg wurde Richard 1192 vom österreichischen Herzog Leopold V., mit dem er sich gleichfalls überworfen hatte, festgesetzt und Kaiser Heinrich VI. übergeben. Damit rächte sich Leopold für eine Verletzung der Ehre (\\"honor\\"), die ihm der englische König während des Kreuzzugs zugefügt hatte. Rund 14 Monate verbrachte Richard in der Region am Oberrhein in Gefangenschaft. Der französische König nutzte dies aus und eroberte eine Reihe von Burgen und Gebieten. Für Richards Freilassung musste aus dem ganzen angevinischen Reich die enorme Summe von 100.000Mark Silber durch Besitzverkauf und besondere Besteuerung beschafft werden. Den Ertrag verwendete Heinrich VI. vor allem zur Finanzierung der Eroberung Siziliens. Nach seiner Freilassung versuchte Richard die von Philipp II. besetzten Gebiete zurückzuerobern. Er starb kinderlos bereits am 6. April 1199 bei der Belagerung von Cabrol bei Limoges., Richards Bild als idealer Ritter und tatkräftiger König ist bis in die Gegenwart in Literatur, Musik und darstellender Kunst legendenhaft verklärt worden. Die zeitgenössische Legendenbildung wurde vor allem vom Dritten Kreuzzug inspiriert. Im 16. Jahrhundert wurde dieser Stoff mit den Geschichten um den englischen Dieb Robin Hood verwoben. Zu einer völlig anderen Einschätzung gelangten die Historiker im protestantischen Großbritannien ab dem 18. Jahrhundert; für sie war Richard ein verantwortungsloser und egoistischer Monarch, der das Inselreich vernachlässigt habe. In der breiteren Öffentlichkeit hingegen galt er ab dem 19. Jahrhundert als ein Symbol nationaler Größe. Die neuere Forschung bemüht sich um ein differenzierteres Bild, wobei die Tendenz zu einer positiven Einschätzung überwiegt., Leben., Herkunft und Jugend., Richard Löwenherz entstammte dem adligen Geschlecht der Plantagenets. Dieser Name wurde jedoch als Dynastiebezeichnung erst ab dem 15. Jahrhundert verwendet, erstmals 1460 durch Herzog Richard von York. Er geht auf König Richards Großvater Gottfried V. zurück, der Graf von Anjou, Tours und Maine war. Der Legende nach trug er einen Ginsterbusch \\"(planta genista)\\" als Helmzier oder pflanzte in seinen Ländereien Ginsterbüsche zum Sichtschutz bei der Jagd., Der englische König Heinrich I. starb 1135 ohne männliche Erben. Daher sollte ihm seine Tochter Mathilde auf den Thron folgen. Gegen sie und ihren Ehemann Gottfried V. formierte sich aber eine Opposition, die Stefan von Blois zum König erhob. Der Konflikt führte zu einem Bürgerkrieg. In dieser angespannten Lage wurde am 5. März 1135 der spätere König Heinrich II. als Sohn Mathildes und Gottfrieds geboren. Er hatte durch seine Eltern nicht nur Anspruch auf das Herzogtum Normandie und die Grafschaft Anjou, sondern auch auf den englischen Thron. Im Mai 1152 heiratete er Eleonore von Aquitanien. Sie hatte von ihrem Vater Wilhelm X. das reiche südwestfranzösische Herzogtum Aquitanien geerbt. Eleonore hatte im Juli 1137 den Sohn des französischen Königs geheiratet und war dadurch zur Königin von Frankreich gekrönt worden. Sie trennte sich 1152 mit kirchlicher Billigung von ihrem königlichen Ehemann Ludwig VII. Durch die Heirat mit Eleonore wurde Richards Vater Heinrich zu einem der mächtigsten Fürsten in Europa und zum größten Rivalen des französischen Königs. Im Mai 1153 wurde der Bürgerkrieg mit dem Vertrag von Winchester beendet. Der gesundheitlich geschwächte Stefan von Blois blieb König bis zu seinem Lebensende, akzeptierte aber Mathildes Sohn, den späteren Heinrich II., als Nachfolger., Nach dem Tod Stefans im Oktober 1154 wurde Heinrich zwei Monate später zum englischen König gewählt. Er ließ sich in Westminster mit Eleonore krönen. Aus der Ehe gingen fünf Söhne (Wilhelm, Heinrich, Richard, Gottfried und Johann) und drei Töchter (Eleonore, Johanna und Mathilde) hervor. Als drittgeborener Sohn war Richard zunächst nicht für die Thronfolge vorgesehen. Heinrich II. übertrug die Erziehung seiner Söhne seinem Kanzler Thomas Becket, an dessen Hof die Kinder von verschiedenen kultivierten Geistlichen unterrichtet wurden. So wurde Richard gründlich in der lateinischen Sprache ausgebildet. Heinrich versuchte durch Heiratsbündnisse Einfluss auf den südfranzösischen Raum zu nehmen. Für Richard wurde 1159 eine Verlobung mit der Tochter von Raimund Berengar IV., Graf von Barcelona beschlossen. Dadurch wollte Heinrich einen Bündnispartner gegen die Grafschaft Toulouse gewinnen. Die geplante Ehe kam jedoch nicht zustande, da Raimund 1162 überraschend starb. Richard hielt sich in der Umgebung seiner Mutter auf. Er reiste im Mai 1165 mit ihr in die Normandie. Über seine weitere Ausbildung und auch über seine Aufenthaltsorte sind bis 1170 keinerlei Angaben überliefert. Mit seiner Mutter war er 1171 im Süden Frankreichs unterwegs. Dabei lernte er die Sprache und Musik Aquitaniens kennen. Sein Vater verlieh ihm bereits in frühen Jahren die Grafschaft Poitou und übertrug ihm die Verwaltung des Herzogtums Aquitanien., Kampf um die Thronfolge und Krönung., Heinrich II. entschloss sich, das angevinische Reich als ungeteiltes Erbe weiterzugeben. Er sah seinen ältesten überlebenden Sohn Heinrich – Wilhelm war schon 1156 gestorben – als Nachfolger in der Königswürde vor. Im Januar 1169 traf er in Montmirail zu Friedensverhandlungen mit dem französischen König Ludwig VII. zusammen. Dort erneuerte er am 6. Januar 1169 die Lehenshuldigung für den Festlandbesitz und ließ zugleich seine Söhne Heinrich und Richard als Erben der französischen Lehen von Ludwig anerkennen. Der älteste Sohn Heinrich leistete Ludwig den Lehenseid für die Normandie, Anjou und Maine, Richard für Aquitanien. Gottfried wurde als Herzog der Bretagne bestätigt und erhielt die Grafschaft Mortain. Johann blieb zunächst ohne Ausstattung. Mit 14 Jahren wurde Richard volljährig., Bereits im Juni 1170 ließ Heinrich seinen gleichnamigen Sohn zum Mitkönig krönen. Im Juni 1172 wurde Richard im Alter von 14 Jahren in der Abtei St. Hilaire in Poitiers feierlich als Herzog von Aquitanien investiert. Heinrich versprach im Frühjahr 1173 seinem jüngsten Sohn Johann die Burgen von Chinon, Loudun und Mirebeau in der Normandie. Heinrich der Jüngere fasste dies als Beeinträchtigung seiner Rechte auf. Dies war der Anlass einer Revolte der Königssöhne gegen ihren Vater. Wegen des jugendlichen Alters der Prinzen Richard und Gottfried ist anzunehmen, dass sie unter dem Einfluss ihrer Mutter Eleonore handelten. Als eigene Motive der beiden kommen ein ausgeprägter Machtwille und die Einschränkung ihrer Rechte im Herzogtum Aquitanien in Betracht. Richard belagerte im Frühjahr und Sommer 1174 königstreue Städte wie La Rochelle, doch im September 1174 musste er gegenüber seinem Vater kapitulieren. Am 29. September 1174 kam es in Montlouis bei Tours zu einem Ausgleich. Richard erhielt die Hälfte der Einnahmen von Aquitanien und zwei Residenzen. Die Söhne hatten eigenes Einkommen und Ländereien, blieben jedoch weiterhin ohne Einfluss auf die Politik ihres königlichen Vaters. Ebenfalls 1174 wurde Richards Heirat mit Alice, der wohl 1170 geborenen Schwester Philipps II. von Frankreich, vereinbart. Sie wurde an den Hof Heinrichs II. geschickt und sollte dort auf ihre Rolle als spätere Gemahlin Richards vorbereitet werden. Den jüngsten Sohn Johann wollte der König mit Aquitanien versorgen, doch weigerte sich Richard, das Herzogtum seinem Bruder zu überlassen., Als Herzog von Aquitanien fiel ihm die Aufgabe zu, gegen die dort opponierenden Adligen vorzugehen. Dabei lag der Schwerpunkt auf der Belagerung und Zerstörung einer Vielzahl von Burgen. In der einzigen Feldschlacht besiegte er Ende Mai 1176 Vulgrin von Aimar. Bis Ende 1176 konnte er unter anderem Aixe und Molineuf einnehmen. Im Januar 1177 eroberte er Dax und Bayonne. Doch bereits 1178 brachen neue Revolten aus. Im Mai 1179 nahm Richard die als uneinnehmbar geltende Festung Taillebourg ein. Vor allem dadurch erwarb er sich einen Ruf als brillanter Kriegsherr. Mit der Einnahme der Festung Taillebourg erreichte Richard, dass die Opponenten zeitweise ihren Widerstand einstellten. Nach Dieter Berg beschränkte sich Richard auf militärische Aktionen gegen aufständische Barone und unterließ es, eine politische Lösung zu suchen. Die Quellen geben keine Hinweise, dass Richard unter den Großen seiner Territorien eine Klientel von herzogstreuen Gefolgsleuten aufbaute. Ebenfalls nahm er keine Reformen im Bereich des Verwaltungs- und Rechtswesens vor. Von Sommer 1179 bis Sommer 1181 ist über die Aufenthalte Richards nichts bekannt. Im Mai 1182 fanden in Anwesenheit Heinrichs II. Verhandlungen in Grandmont in La Marche statt. Bei den Grafen in Aquitanien war Richard als Herzog wegen seines brutalen Vorgehens und seiner ständigen Rechtsverstöße verhasst. Die persönlichen Verfehlungen Richards griffen auch englische Chronisten auf. Nach Roger von Howden machte Richard die Frauen, Töchter und Verwandten der Unterworfenen zu seinen Konkubinen. Nach Befriedigung seiner Lust habe er sie dann an seine Soldaten weiter gegeben. Die militärischen Auseinandersetzungen wurden in der Folgezeit fortgesetzt., Nach dem Tod des ältesten Sohnes Heinrich im Juni 1183 war die Thronfolge wieder völlig offen. Bei einer Einigung Heinrichs II. mit Richard im Jahr 1185 blieb Johann weiterhin „ohne Land“.

Der größtenteils aus Hauptdolomit aufgebaute, stark vergletscherte Berg ist der Hauptgipfel der Ortler-Alpen, einer Gebirgsgruppe der Südlichen Ostalpen. Seine Erstbesteigung auf Befehl von Erzherzog Johann von Österreich im Jahre 1804 zählt zu den bedeutendsten alpinistischen Ereignissen jener Zeit. Bis zur Abtrennung Südtirols von Österreich 1919 war der Ortler der höchste Berg Österreich-Ungarns. Während des Ersten Weltkriegs richtete die k.u.k. Armee auf dem Berg die mit mehreren Geschützen ausgestattete höchstgelegene Stellung dieses Krieges ein. Heute gilt der Ortler unter Bergsteigern als eines der bedeutendsten Gipfelziele der Ostalpen. Alle Routen zum Gipfel sind anspruchsvolle Hochtouren, von denen der Normalweg von Norden die am meisten begangene ist. Alpinistisch bedeutend ist auch die Nordwand des Berges, die als größte Eiswand der Ostalpen gilt, in der jedoch immer mehr Fels zutage tritt., Geographie., Lage und Umgebung., Der Ortler liegt im Westen Südtirols, im oberen Vinschgau, nahe der Grenze zur Provinz Sondrio in der Lombardei und der Staatsgrenze zur Schweiz. Er ist Teil des gewaltigen Gebirgszugs des Ortler-Hauptkamms in den nördlichen Ortler-Alpen, wobei er sich in einem am Zebrù () gegen Norden abzweigenden Seitenkamm erhebt, der das Trafoital mit der Stilfser-Joch-Straße und der Ortschaft Trafoi () im Westen vom Suldental mit dem Ort Sulden () im Osten trennt. Nördlich des Ortlers folgen im Kammverlauf die Tabarettaspitze (), der \\"Bärenkopf\\" () und die \\"Hochleitenspitze\\" (), hinter der das Trafoital beim Weiler Gomagoi () in das Suldental einmündet. Das gesamte Gebiet gehört zur Gemeinde Stilfs und ist Bestandteil des Nationalparks Stilfserjoch., Die Aussicht vom Gipfel umfasst die Ötztaler Alpen, die Silvretta- und Berninagruppe sowie die Adamello-Presanella-Alpen, die Brenta und die Dolomiten. An klaren Tagen reicht sie im Westen bis zum etwa 185 Kilometer entfernten Finsteraarhorn in den Berner Alpen. Auch das ganze Gebiet um den Reschenpass und die Malser Haide ist gut zu sehen. Im Hauptkamm erheben sich nahe neben dem Zebrù weitere Hochgipfel wie die Königspitze () und die Thurwieserspitze (), benachbarte Gebirgszüge sind der Chavalatschkamm mit der Rötlspitze (\\"Piz Cotschen\\", \\"Punta Rosa\\", ) westlich des Trafoitals, und die Laaser Berge mit der Vertainspitze () östlich des Suldentals. Alle diese Gebirgskämme werden ebenfalls zu den Ortler-Alpen gezählt., Der Ortler ist der höchste Berg im Umkreis von 49 Kilometern, bis zum Piz Zupò (). Dieser befindet sich in der Berninagruppe mit dem Piz Bernina (). Um dorthin zu gelangen, müsste bis zum hohen Passo di Fraele abgestiegen werden. Die Schartenhöhe des Ortlers beträgt somit 1950 Meter. Diese Schartenhöhe wird in den Alpen nur von 13 weiteren Bergen übertroffen., Topographie., Der Ortler weist eine verhältnismäßig starke Gliederung aus zahlreichen Graten, Wänden und Gletschern auf. Der Gipfel selbst ist eine nur etwa 20 Meter hohe Erhebung über dem Ortlerplateau, einer großen, nach Nordwesten in Richtung zur \\"Hohen Eisrinne\\" (auch \\"Trafoier Eisrinne\\") und zum Trafoital hin leicht abfallenden Hochfläche, die vom \\"Oberen Ortlerferner\\" bedeckt ist. Auf allen Seiten schließen steile Felswände an dieses Gletscherplateau an, insbesondere an seiner östlichen Begrenzung, dem \\"Nordgrat\\" oder \\"Tabarettakamm\\". Dieser verläuft über die unbedeutende Graterhebung \\"Tschierfeck\\" (auch \\"Tschirfeck\\", ) zur hohen Tabarettaspitze und bricht in östlicher Richtung, also zum Suldental hin, mit Eisbrüchen zur 1200 Meter hohen vereisten \\"Nordwand\\" und zu dem darunter liegenden \\"Marltferner\\" ab. Dieser wird im Südosten vom nach Nordosten verlaufenden \\"Marltgrat\\" begrenzt, von dem in nordnordöstlicher Richtung ein Seitenast, der \\"Rothböckgrat\\" abzweigt. Die Ostwand des Ortlers wird von einem steilen Couloir, der \\"Schückrinne\\", durchzogen, die in den darunterliegenden \\"End-der-Welt-Ferner\\" mündet. Im Südosten zieht der teilweise vergletscherte \\"Hintergrat\\" über den \\"Signalkopf\\" (), den \\"Oberen\\" () und \\"Unteren Knott\\" () hinab zum \\"Hintergratkopf\\" (). Die Südostwand wird von der \\"Minnigeroderinne\\" durchzogen, unter der der Suldenferner liegt. In Richtung Süden führt vom \\"Ortler-Vorgipfel\\" (\\"Anticima\\", ) der \\"Hochjochgrat\\" zum hohen \\"Hochjoch\\", dem Übergang zum Monte Zebrù. Westlich des Hochjochs liegt der Zebrùferner, der zum bereits zur Lombardei gehörenden Val Zebrù \\"(Zebrùtal)\\" abfließt. Im Norden trennt der hohe \\"Ortlerpass\\" den Zebrùferner vom nordwestlich in Richtung Trafoital fließenden \\"Unteren Ortlerferner\\". Den nördlichen Abschluss dieses Gletschers bildet der bis zu 1000 Meter hohe Felsaufschwung der \\"Hinteren Wandlen\\", die den südwestlichen Abbruch des Oberen Ortlerferners bilden. Nach Nordwesten münden die Hinteren Wandlen in den \\"Pleißhorngrat\\", der das hohe \\"Pleißhorn\\" \\"(Corno di Plaies)\\" trägt., Geologie., Der Gipfelaufbau des Ortlers besteht im Wesentlichen aus Hauptdolomit, einem Flachwasser-Sedimentgestein der Obertrias, genauer des Noriums. Er weist die typische waagrechte Bankung auf, wie sie auch in den nahe gelegenen Dolomiten auftritt. Im Unterschied zu den dortigen Gesteinen ist der Ortlerdolomit jedoch schwach metamorph überprägt, das heißt, er wurde in der Oberkreide vor etwa 90 Millionen Jahren unter hohem Druck auf etwa 400°C erhitzt. Nach der heute vorherrschenden Interpretation des geologischen Aufbaus der Alpen geschah dies bei der nordwärts gerichteten Verschiebung der Nördlichen Kalkalpen über die Ortler-Alpen hinweg. Das Gestein zeichnet sich daher neben seiner dunkleren, grauen Farbe vor allem durch das Fehlen von Fossilien aus, da diese während der Metamorphose zerstört wurden. Darüber hinaus liegt der Dolomit des Ortlers viel höher als in allen anderen Verbreitungsgebieten dieses Gesteins. Nach dem Eiger ist der Ortler der zweithöchste aus Sedimentgestein bestehende Gipfel der Alpen. Der Ortlerdolomit unterliegt daher in weitaus höherem Ausmaß der Frostverwitterung als der Fels der Dolomiten, der von der Verwitterung durch flüssiges Wasser (chemische Verwitterung) geprägt ist, und weist glattere Oberflächen und eine große Brüchigkeit auf, wodurch er sich auch schlechter zum Klettern eignet. Eingelagert in den bankigen Hauptdolomit sind neben einigen mehrere Meter dicken Olisthostromen auch Schichten von „Kalkschiefer“. Insgesamt erreicht der Dolomit des Ortlers eine Mächtigkeit bis zu 1000 Metern, wobei häufig vermutet wird, durch mehrfache Überschiebung habe sich hier eine ursprünglich dünnere Dolomitabfolge zu solcher Dicke aufgestapelt. Diese These gilt jedoch bis heute nicht als vollständig gesichert, da der Ortler immer noch ungenügend geologisch untersucht ist. Geologische Forschungen waren aufgrund der Gletscherbedeckung lange Zeit schwierig. Erst in den letzten Jahrzehnten wurde durch den Gletscherschwund mehr Gestein freigelegt., Unterlagert wird der Dolomit von schwach metamorphen Konglomeraten, Sandsteinen und Gips aus der Untertrias sowie von Alpinem Verrucano aus dem Perm. Diese Schichten sind aber nur wenige Meter mächtig. Sie ruhen auf einem Fundament aus Veltliner Basiskristallin. Dieses Kristallin hat vor der kreidezeitlichen schon während der Kaledonischen und der Variszischen Orogenese jeweils Metamorphosen erfahren, die überdies intensiver waren. Es handelt sich heute hauptsächlich um Gneis, Glimmerschiefer und Phyllit, die das Bild der Landschaft bis in eine Höhe von etwa prägen., Tektonisch gehört der Ortler zum ostalpinen Deckenstapel., Klima und Vergletscherung., Das Gebiet um den Ortler ist von einer hohen Reliefenergie geprägt: Das nur zwölf Kilometer entfernte Prad am Stilfserjoch im Etschtal liegt 3000 Meter unterhalb des Ortlergipfels. Diese außergewöhnlichen Höhenunterschiede führen dazu, dass verschiedene Vegetationsstufen besonders eng nebeneinander zu finden sind. Die in sonnigen tiefen Lagen etwa des nahegelegenen Martelltals vertretene submediterrane Vegetation ist am Ortler selbst zwar nicht zu finden, insgesamt ist das Klima des Gebietes jedoch vom Mittelmeerklima beeinflusst und daher trockener und milder als das in den nahegelegenen Zentralalpen, die die Ortler-Alpen vor den Niederschlägen der Alpennordseite abschirmen. Die Jahresniederschläge übersteigen daher kaum 1000 Millimeter pro Jahr. Die Schneegrenze liegt um einiges höher als in den Zentralalpen., Das hohe Ausmaß an Vereisung am Ortler ist daher nur am höchstgelegenen Gletscher, dem Oberen Ortlerferner, auf die in der Höhe niedrigen Temperaturen zurückzuführen. Am Gipfelplateau wurden schon Temperaturen von etwa −40°C gemessen. Die Entstehung der tiefer liegenden Gletscher um den Berg, insbesondere des Suldenferners, ist eher eine Folge der topographischen Verhältnisse. Diese Gletscher haben nur kleine Niederschläge akkumulierende Nährgebiete und werden großteils von Eis- und Schneelawinen gespeist, die über die steilen Flanken abgehen. Der Eisschlag vom Oberen Ortlerferner kann dabei 2000 Höhenmeter überwinden und die Straße nach Sulden gefährden. Auch durch Schneelawinen aus der Ortlernordwand wurde die Straße schon mehrmals verlegt, dabei starben beispielsweise im April 1975 mehrere Menschen. Im flacheren Gelände unterhalb der Steilwände können sich diese Schnee- und Eismassen zu neuen Gletschern sammeln. Durch den anhaltenden Steinschlag aufgrund des brüchigen Gesteins des Ortlers kommt es auf diesen Gletschern zu einer besonders starken Schuttbedeckung, insbesondere am Sulden-, End-der-Welt- und Marltferner, die teilweise komplett unter Gestein verborgen liegen., Der Rückgang der Gletscher nach der Kleinen Eiszeit unterschied sich am Ortler deutlich von den meisten anderen Alpengletschern, die etwa um 1860 ihren Höchststand erreichten. Am Suldenferner kam es viel früher, zwischen 1817 und 1819, zu einem äußerst raschen Vorstoß, der sogar das Siedlungsgebiet von Sulden bedrohte.

Jahrhundert, Gestorben im 5. Jahrhundert, Kosmologe der Antike, Literatur (Latein), Mann, Neuplatoniker, Person als Namensgeber für einen Mondkrater, Person der Spätantike, Philologe der Antike], Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius (die Reihenfolge der Namen variiert; * vermutlich um 385/390; † vermutlich nach 430) war ein vorzüglich gebildeter spätantiker römischer Philosoph und Grammatiker. Sein Werk spielte im Mittelalter bei der Vermittlung antiken Bildungsguts eine wichtige Rolle. Sicher ist, dass er ein hoher Beamter war, doch die Frage, ob er mit einem der bekannten gleichnamigen Amtsträger identifiziert werden kann, wird in der Forschung seit Jahrzehnten kontrovers diskutiert und bleibt weiterhin offen. Er war ein konservativer Vertreter der neuplatonischen Weltanschauung. Zum Christentum äußerte er sich nicht., Seine drei Werke – die \\"Saturnalia\\" („Saturnalien“), ein Kommentar zu Ciceros \\"Somnium Scipionis\\" und eine nur auszugsweise erhaltene grammatische Schrift – sind wohl im zweiten und dritten Jahrzehnt des 5. Jahrhunderts entstanden. Die \\"Saturnalia\\" schildern die Gespräche bei einem Gastmahl im späten 4. Jahrhundert. Sie idealisieren das damalige Gelehrtentum konservativer Persönlichkeiten des „Symmachuskreises“ um Quintus Aurelius Symmachus und führen dem Leser vor Augen, wie in diesem Milieu Traditionspflege betrieben wurde. Der Cicero-Kommentar, in dem das \\"Somnium Scipionis\\" aus neuplatonischer Sicht gedeutet wird, gehörte im Mittelalter zu den beliebtesten antiken Werken., Leben., Über das Leben des Macrobius ist sehr wenig bekannt, Annahmen über seine Herkunft sind spekulativ. Einer beiläufigen Äußerung in den \\"Saturnalia\\" ist zu entnehmen, dass er nicht aus Italien stammte. Sein Umgang mit dem Griechischen lässt erkennen, dass es nicht seine Muttersprache war. Seit dem 19. Jahrhundert ist wiederholt eine afrikanische Herkunft vermutet worden., Sein in Handschriften der \\"Saturnalia\\" und des Cicero-Kommentars überlieferter Titel \\"vir clarissimus et illustris\\" zeigt, dass er senatorischen Ranges war und sehr hohe Ämter bekleidet hatte. Er war, wie aus seinen Werken ersichtlich ist, ein Anhänger der neuplatonischen Philosophie, die damals den gebildeten Gegnern der christlichen Staatsreligion als Grundlage ihrer religiösen Weltanschauung diente. Macrobius vermied eine Stellungnahme zu dem religiösen Konflikt. Er griff das Christentum nicht an, auch nicht indirekt, sondern verschwieg es konsequent., Macrobius hatte einen Sohn, der Flavius Macrobius Plotinus Eustathius hieß und in den sechziger Jahren des 5. Jahrhunderts Stadtpräfekt von Rom \\"(praefectus urbi)\\" war. Ein Gelehrter namens Macrobius Plotinus Eudoxius, der zusammen mit Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus vor 485 in Ravenna eine Abschrift von Macrobius’ Kommentar zum \\"Somnium Scipionis\\" durchsah und korrigierte, war vermutlich ein Enkel des Schriftstellers. Schon in einem ägyptischen Papyrus des frühen 4. Jahrhunderts aus Oxyrhynchos tauchen die Namen Makrobios und Eudoxios nahe beieinander auf; daher ist vermutet worden, dass der Schriftsteller Macrobius und sein Enkel Eudoxius einer Familie oberägyptischer Herkunft angehörten, in der diese beiden Namen traditionell gebräuchlich waren., Die Frage, ob der Schriftsteller mit anderweitig bekannten gleichnamigen Personen identifiziert werden kann, ist in der Forschung intensiv diskutiert worden. Aus ihrer Beantwortung ergeben sich Konsequenzen für die Datierung seines Lebens und seiner Werke. Mehrere hohe Beamte, die im \\"Codex Theodosianus\\" (438) erwähnt sind, sind in Betracht gezogen worden: ein Prätorianerpräfekt, ein Prokonsul der Provinz \\"Africa\\", ein \\"Vicarius\\" von Hispanien und ein Oberkämmerer (\\"praepositus sacri cubiculi\\") in Konstantinopel. Einige Forscher nahmen an, es handle sich bei den drei letztgenannten um ein und dieselbe Person, doch diese Vermutung hat sich als irrig erwiesen., Wahrscheinlich handelt es sich bei dem Theodosius, dem der Dichter Avianus seine Fabeln widmete, um den Schriftsteller Macrobius., Werke., Die Datierung der drei bekannten Werke des Macrobius ist unsicher. Zuerst verfasste er, als er noch nicht \\"vir illustris\\" war, die grammatische Abhandlung; sie entstand wohl zwischen 420 und 430. Sein zweites Werk waren die \\"Saturnalia\\", die er seinem Sohn Eustathius widmete, als dieser noch ein Schulkind war. Als Macrobius das dritte Werk, den Kommentar zum \\"Somnium Scipionis\\", Eustathius widmete, war sein Sohn bereits ein junger Mann, der eine philosophische Ausbildung erhalten konnte, also ungefähr zwanzig Jahre alt. Daher wird der Kommentar etwa fünf bis zehn Jahre später als die \\"Saturnalia\\" datiert. Als wahrscheinlicher Zeitraum für die Abfassung dieser beiden Werke gelten heute die zwanziger und dreißiger Jahre des 5. Jahrhunderts., Macrobius erweist sich als gewandter Stilist, der sich in gehobener, aber nicht gekünstelter Sprache auszudrücken weiß. Er versteht es, seinen Stoff geschickt zu ordnen. Nachdrücklich bringt er seine konservative Gesinnung zur Geltung; Homer und Platon, Vergil und Cicero sind für ihn Autoritäten höchsten Ranges und Vertreter einer einheitlichen, unzweifelhaft richtigen Weisheitslehre., \\"Saturnalia\\"., Literarische Gestaltung und Quellen., Die \\"Saturnalia\\" sind das letzte bekannte antike Werk aus der Gattung der Symposion-Literatur, die fiktive Gespräche bei Gastmählern wiedergibt. Diesen Rahmen verwendet der Autor zur Darbietung von Wissensstoff aus unterschiedlichen Bereichen. Als formales Vorbild dient ihm Platons \\"Symposion\\". Die Gespräche sollen während des Festes der Saturnalien geführt worden sein. Macrobius lässt prominente historische Persönlichkeiten des späten 4. Jahrhunderts auftreten. Unter den Teilnehmern sind einflussreiche stadtrömische Vertreter der paganen Bildungstradition: die Senatoren Vettius Agorius Praetextatus († 384), Quintus Aurelius Symmachus und Virius Nicomachus Flavianus. Auch der noch junge Grammatiker Servius, der später als Verfasser von Kommentaren zu den drei großen Dichtungen Vergils hervorgetreten ist, gehört zu dem erlesenen Kreis. Es sind zwölf Personen, die aber nicht alle ständig anwesend sind; überwiegend Römer, aber auch einige Griechen und ein Ägypter. Indem Macrobius einen ägyptischen Gast namens Horus auftreten lässt, schafft er Gelegenheit zur Erörterung römischer Einrichtungen, die dem Ägypter unbekannt sind. Horus vertritt in der Runde den Kynismus., In Wirklichkeit kann ein Gastmahl mit diesem Gästekreis nicht stattgefunden haben, denn zwei Teilnehmer, darunter Servius, waren als historische Personen zu jung, um als Gesprächspartner der anderen in Betracht zu kommen. Diese chronologische Unstimmigkeit nimmt Macrobius bewusst in Kauf, wobei er sich im Vorwort zur Rechtfertigung des literarischen Anachronismus auf das Vorbild der Dialoge Platons beruft., Die einzelnen Dialogpartner erhalten ein individuelles Profil und vertreten teils unterschiedliche Überzeugungen, doch fehlt dem Gesprächsverlauf die Dramatik, denn es werden keine Kontroversen geführt. Allerdings ergeben sich peinliche Situationen, da ein Gesprächsteilnehmer, Euangelus, durch seine Grobheit und Respektlosigkeit die übrigen Anwesenden provoziert und ihre Geduld auf die Probe stellt, ohne sie mit seinen spöttischen und sogar beleidigenden Bemerkungen aus der Fassung bringen zu können. Seine Anmaßung und Inkompetenz erfährt eine sachliche und überlegene Zurückweisung; so wird die durch ungebührliches Verhalten gestörte soziale Rangordnung unter den Anwesenden nachdrücklich und unter Wahrung der Umgangsformen verteidigt., Erörtert wird eine Fülle von Themen vor allem aus den Bereichen der Kulturgeschichte, der Mythologie, der religiösen Bräuche und der Philologie. Die Gesprächspartner verknüpfen die kulturhistorischen mit den philologischen Fragestellungen, indem sie immer wieder den Sprachgebrauch und die Etymologie und Geschichte einzelner Begriffe thematisieren. Dabei zeigen sie ihre Gelehrsamkeit, indem sie zahlreiche Zitate aus griechischer und römischer Dichtung und Fachliteratur einstreuen. Da darunter Zitate aus heute verlorenen Werken älterer Autoren sind, stellen die \\"Saturnalia\\" eine wertvolle literaturgeschichtliche Quelle dar. Unter diesem Gesichtspunkt wissen Altertumswissenschaftler die \\"Saturnalia\\" besonders zu schätzen, zumal da Macrobius korrekt zu zitieren pflegt und manchmal den genauen Wortlaut wiedergibt. Seine Belesenheit ist aber in Wirklichkeit nicht so beeindruckend, wie die Vielfalt der zitierten Autoren vermuten lässt, denn er hat wohl einen großen Teil der Literatur, die er nennt, nicht selbst in Händen gehabt. Wahrscheinlich kannte er viele Werke, deren Originaltexte längst verschollen waren, nur indirekt aus Quellen, in denen bereits Sammlungen von Auszügen und Zitaten zusammengestellt waren. Diese Zwischenquellen nennt er nicht. Zu den Werken, die er heranzog, gehören die \\"Noctes Atticae\\" des Gellius, Briefe Senecas und Plutarchs \\"Quaestiones convivales\\". Den \\"Noctes Atticae\\" entnahm Macrobius viel Material, ohne diese Quelle jemals anzugeben., Macrobius gliedert sein Werk in sieben Bücher. Der Text ist nicht vollständig überliefert; vom zweiten, vierten, sechsten und siebten Buch fehlt der Schluss, vom dritten und vierten der Anfang., Inhalt., Die Saturnalien sind ein mehrtägiges Fest, das die kultivierten Gesprächsteilnehmer zusammen feiern; die Vormittage widmen sie ernsthafter Diskussion, nachmittags wenden sie sich heiterer Unterhaltung zu. Die Gespräche beginnen am Vorabend des Festes, dem 16. Dezember, im Hause des Vettius Agorius Praetextatus und werden am ersten Festtag beim selben Gastgeber fortgesetzt (Bücher 1 und 2). Am zweiten Festtag ist Virius Nicomachus Flavianus der Gastgeber (Buch 3), am dritten und letzten Tag Quintus Aurelius Symmachus (Bücher 4–7). Die fiktiven Gespräche werden aber nicht aus der Perspektive eines Anwesenden erzählt, sondern aus der eines Berichterstatters namens Postumianus, der selbst nicht an dem Symposion teilgenommen hat, da er zwar eingeladen, aber verhindert war. Postumianus gibt an, er stütze sich auf die Darstellung des Gesprächsteilnehmers Eusebius, der ihm am Tag der Wintersonnenwende, wenige Tage nach den Saturnalien, den Verlauf geschildert habe. Diese Konstellation entspricht derjenigen von Platons \\"Symposion\\"., Kommentar zu Ciceros \\"Somnium Scipionis\\"., Der Kommentar zu Ciceros „Traum des Scipio“ \\"(Somnium Scipionis)\\" ist vollständig überliefert; er um: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"- Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius - 4.

Der Begriff \\"Enzyklopädie\\" soll auf Ausführlichkeit oder eine große Themenbreite hinweisen, wie beispielsweise bei einem Menschen, dem enzyklopädisches Wissen nachgesagt wird. Es wird eine Zusammenfassung des gesamten Wissens dargestellt. Die Enzyklopädie ist demzufolge eine überblickende Anordnung des Wissens einer bestimmten Zeit und eines bestimmten Raumes, welche Zusammenhänge darstellt. Daneben werden als Fachenzyklopädien solche Werke bezeichnet, die nur ein einzelnes Fach- oder Sachgebiet behandeln., Die Bedeutung des Begriffes Enzyklopädie ist fließend; Enzyklopädien standen zwischen Lehrbüchern einerseits und Wörterbüchern andererseits. Als älteste vollständig erhaltene Enzyklopädie gilt die \\"Naturalis historia\\" aus dem ersten nachchristlichen Jahrhundert. Vor allem die große französische \\"Encyclopédie\\" (1751–1780) hat die Bezeichnung „Enzyklopädie“ für ein Sachwörterbuch durchgesetzt. Aufgrund der alphabetischen Anordnung werden Enzyklopädien oft als Lexika bezeichnet., Die heutige Form des Nachschlagewerkes hat sich vor allem seit dem 18.Jahrhundert entwickelt; dabei handelt es sich um ein umfangreiches Sachwörterbuch über alle Themen für eine breite Leserschaft. Im 19.Jahrhundert kam der typische neutral-sachliche Stil hinzu. Die Enzyklopädien wurden klarer strukturiert und beinhalteten neue Texte, keine bloßen Übernahmen älterer (fremder) Werke. Eines der bekanntesten Beispiele im deutschen Sprachraum war lange Zeit die \\"Brockhaus Enzyklopädie\\" (ab 1808), im englischen die \\"Encyclopaedia Britannica\\" (ab 1768)., Seit den 1980er-Jahren werden Enzyklopädien ferner in digitaler Form angeboten, auf CD-ROM und im Internet. Teilweise sind es Fortführungen älterer Werke, teilweise neue Projekte. Ein besonderer Erfolg war die 1993 erstmals auf CD-ROM herausgegebene \\"Microsoft Encarta\\". Die 2001 gegründete \\"Wikipedia\\" entwickelte sich zur größten Internet-Enzyklopädie., Begriff., Definitionen., Die Althistorikerin Aude Doody nannte die Enzyklopädie eine Gattung, die man nur schwer definieren könne. Enzyklopädismus sei das Streben nach universellem Wissen oder auch die Summe des allgemeinen Wissens (einer bestimmten Kultur). Konkret sei die Enzyklopädie ein Buch, „das entweder die gesamte Garnitur des allgemeinen Wissens oder ein erschöpfendes Spektrum an Material über einen spezialistischen Gegenstand versammelt und ordnet.“ Die Enzyklopädie beanspruche, einfachen Zugang zu Informationen über alles zu verschaffen, das der Einzelne über seine Welt wissen muss., Für das Selbstverständnis von Enzyklopädien werden oftmals die Vorworte der Werke ausgewertet. Im 18. und vor allem 19. Jahrhundert betonten sie, dass sie Wissen zusammenfassen, und zwar nicht für Fachleute, sondern für ein breiteres Publikum. Im Vorwort des \\"Brockhaus\\" etwa heißt es 1809:, Der Bibliothekswissenschaftler und Enzyklopädie-Experte Robert Collison schrieb um 1970 für die \\"Encyclopaedia Britannica\\" einleitend im entsprechenden \\"Macropaedia\\"-Artikel:, Entwicklung zum modernen Begriff., Der moderne Begriff „Enzyklopädie“ setzt sich aus zwei griechischen Wörtern zusammen:, im Kreis herumgehend, auch: umfassend, allgemein, sowie, Erziehung oder Unterricht. Das daraus zusammengesetzte verwies auf die „chorische Erziehung“, meinte also ursprünglich die musische Ausbildung junger freigeborener Griechen im Kreis des Theaterchores. Eine verbindliche Auflistung der vermittelten Fächer gab es bei den Griechen nicht. Moderne Forscher ziehen es vor, den griechischen Ausdruck als allgemeine Erziehung zu übersetzen, im Sinne einer grundlegenden Bildung., Der Römer Quintilian (35 bis ca. 96 nach Christus) griff den griechischen Ausdruck auf und übersetzte ihn. Bevor Jungen zu Rednern ausgebildet würden, sollten sie den Bildungsweg (den \\"orbis ille doctrinae\\", wörtlich: Kreis der Lehre) durchlaufen. Auch Vitruv bezeichnete mit eine Vorbildung für die bei ihm angestrebte Spezialisierung zum Architekten. Dementsprechend variierten die genannten Fächer. Quintilian erwähnt für Redner beispielsweise die Bereiche Geometrie und Musik., Unklar bleibt, was Plinius gemeint hat, als er die im Vorwort zu seiner \\"Naturalis historia\\" (Naturgeschichte, ca. 77 n. Chr.) erwähnte. Das liegt nicht nur an der Unbestimmtheit der möglichen Fächer, sondern auch an Undeutlichkeiten der Textstelle. Die wurde schließlich zu einer Sammelbezeichnung für die sich im Römischen Reich ausbildenden (sieben) freien Künste, die \\"artes liberales\\"., Das Wort Enzyklopädie geht auf eine fehlerhafte Rückübersetzung der Stelle bei Quintilian zurück. Dieses \\"tas Encyclopaedias\\" in Plinius-Ausgaben seit 1497 setzte dann den Ausdruck durch. Es wurde als griechische Übersetzung von \\"orbis doctrinae\\" angesehen. In Nationalsprachen erschien der Ausdruck dann in den 1530er-Jahren. In der Mitte des 16.Jahrhunderts konnte man das Wort ohne weitere Erklärung in Buchtiteln für Werke verwenden, „in denen die Gesamtheit der Wissenschaften nach einer bestimmten Ordnung dargestellt wird“, so Ulrich Dierse. Die Betonung lag dabei nicht auf Gesamtheit, sondern auf Ordnung., Guillaume Budé verwendete die lateinische Neuschöpfung 1508 im Sinne einer allesumfassenden Wissenschaft oder Gelehrtheit. Wohl zum ersten Mal in einem Buchtitel erschien das Wort 1538. Damals veröffentlichte der südniederländische Pädagoge Joachim Sterck van Ringelbergh: \\"Lucubrationes, vel potius absolutissima, nempe liber de ratione studii\\" („Nachtarbeiten, oder vielmehr vollständigste \\"\\", also ein Buch über die Methode des Lernens“). Als Haupttitel eines Buches tauchte es zuerst 1559 auf: \\"Encyclopaediae, seu orbis disciplinarum\\" (\\"Encyclopaedia\\", oder der Kreis der Fächer) des Kroaten Pavao Skalić., Die englische \\"Cyclopaedia\\" von 1728 war ein alphabetisch geordnetes Nachschlagewerk, ein \\"dictionary of the arts and sciences\\". Der Durchbruch des Namens Enzyklopädie kam erst mit der großen französischen \\"Encyclopédie\\" (1751 und Folgejahre). Nach dem Vorbild dieses Werkes etablierte sich der Begriff für ein allgemeines Sachwörterbuch., Daneben wurde das Wort auch für die Erkenntnis von der Einheit des Wissens verwendet; in diesem Sinne beschrieb der Philosoph Christian Appel seinen 1784 an der Universität Mainz eingerichteten „Lehrstuhl für allgemeine Enzyklopädie“. In der Erziehung gehe man von einfachen sinnlichen Eindrücken und Erfahrungen aus, dann komme man über einen Abstraktionsprozess zu zusammenhängenden wissenschaftlichen Weisheiten. Diese seien aber verstreut, daher brauche man eine Zusammenfassung. So solle die Enzyklopädie nicht am Anfang des Universitätsstudiums stehen, sondern am Ende, als Krönung. Für die Erforschung der Enzyklopädien wiederum hat sich der Begriff Enzyklopädik eingebürgert., Andere Bezeichnungen., Während bei den Römern die Titel von Nachschlage- und Lehrwerken meistens eher nüchtern waren, überwogen seit der Spätantike bis in die Frühe Neuzeit Metaphern:, Alphabetisch angeordnete Enzyklopädien hießen oder heißen \\"Dictionarium\\", \\"Wörterbuch\\" oder \\"Lexikon\\". Weitere Bezeichnungen lauten: \\"Enzyklopädisches Wörterbuch\\", \\"Sachwörterbuch\\", \\"Realwörterbuch\\", dazu \\"Reallexikon\\" und \\"Realenzyklopädie\\", \\"Konversationslexikon\\", \\"Universallexikon\\" usw., Im Englischen und Französischen war \\"dictionary\\" beziehungsweise \\"dictionnaire\\" weit verbreitet, oft in der Zusammenfassung \\"dictionary of the arts and sciences\\" beziehungsweise \\"dictionnaire des arts et des sciences\\". Im Deutschen spiegelt sich das im Titel der \\"Allgemeinen Encyclopädie der Wissenschaften und Künste\\" von Ersch-Gruber (1818–1889) wider. Als Künste sind gängigerweise die mechanischen und handwerklichen Künste zu verstehen, und der Begriff der Wissenschaft sollte nicht zu eng aufgefasst werden, so wurde die Theologie damals noch selbstverständlich zur Wissenschaft gezählt. \\"Real\\" oder \\"Realia\\" steht für Sachen im Gegensatz zu Begriffen oder Wörtern, ein \\"Realwörterbuch\\" ist also ein Sachwörterbuch und kein Sprachwörterbuch., Geschichte., Literarische Gattung und Begriff laufen in der Geschichte der Enzyklopädie nicht parallel zueinander. Darum lässt sich darüber streiten, ob es vor der Neuzeit überhaupt Enzyklopädien gegeben hat. Zumindest waren sich die antiken und mittelalterlichen Autoren einer solchen literarischen Gattung nicht bewusst. Es herrscht weite Übereinstimmung, beispielsweise die \\"Naturalis historia\\" aus dem Alten Rom als Enzyklopädie anzusehen. Dabei besteht allerdings die Gefahr einer anachronistischen Sichtweise, nämlich ein antikes Werk mit modernen Augen zu sehen und es unangemessen zu interpretieren, warnt Aude Doody., Die Historiker sind sich nicht darüber einig, welches Werk als die erste Enzyklopädie anzusehen ist. Das liegt einerseits daran, dass viele Werke verloren gegangen sind und nur noch aus kurzen Beschreibungen oder Bruchstücken bekannt sind. Andererseits gibt es keine verbindliche Definition einer Enzyklopädie, manche Historiker berücksichtigen auch einen enzyklopädischen Ansatz im Sinne eines Strebens nach Umfassendheit., Altertum., Als ein geistiger Vater der Enzyklopädie wird der griechische Philosoph Platon genannt. Er hat zwar selbst keine Enzyklopädie verfasst, aber mit seiner Akademie zu Athen verschrieb er sich dazu, die ganze Bildung jedem intelligenten jungen Mann zur Verfügung zu stellen. Von einem enzyklopädischen Werk von Platons Neffen Speusippos (gestorben 338 v. Chr.) sind nur noch Fragmente erhalten. Einen enzyklopädischen Ansatz, im Sinne von umfassend, hat man auch Aristoteles nachgesagt., Die Griechen sind für ihre intellektuellen Erkundungen und ihre philosophische Originalität bekannt. Sie haben ihr Wissen aber nicht in einem einzelnen Werk zusammengefasst. So gelten die Römer als die eigentlichen Erfinder der Enzyklopädie. In der Römischen Republik gab es bereits die Briefserie \\"Praecepta ad filium\\" (etwa 183v.Chr.), mit der Cato der Ältere seinen: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Enzyklopädie, Nachschlagewerk, Lexikon, Wissenschaftliche Literatur, Französisch, Grundausbildung, Allgemeinbildung, umfangreiches Nachschlagewerk, Fachenzyklopädien, Brockhaus Enzyklopädie, Wikipedia"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Abgeordneter des Unterhauses (Kanada), Geboren 1844, Gestorben 1885, Hingerichtete Person (19. Jahrhundert), Hingerichtete Person (Kanada), Kanadier, Mann, Revolutionär], Louis „David“ Riel [] (* 22. Oktober 1844 in der Red-River-Kolonie; † 16. November 1885 in Regina, Saskatchewan) war ein kanadischer Rebell und Politiker. Er war Mitbegründer der Provinz Manitoba und eine Führungspersönlichkeit der Métis. Riel führte in der kanadischen Prärie zwei Aufstände gegen die Bundesregierung unter Premierminister John Macdonald an. Er strebte danach, Rechte und Kultur seines Volkes, der Métis, zu bewahren, deren Heimat, die zuvor von der Hudson’s Bay Company verwaltet worden war, 1869 vom kanadischen Bundesstaat gekauft wurde und zunehmend unter anglo-kanadischen Siedlungsdruck geriet., Während der Red-River-Rebellion von 1869/70 führte Riel in der Red-River-Kolonie eine provisorische Regierung. Diese handelte die Bedingungen des Manitoba Act aus, unter denen die heutige Provinz Manitoba innerhalb der Kanadischen Konföderation auf dem Gebiet der damaligen Nordwest-Territorien gegründet wurde. Als Folge der während des Aufstands von ihm angeordneten Hinrichtung des militanten Oraniers Thomas Scott musste Riel in die Vereinigten Staaten ins Exil gehen. Dreimal wurde er in Abwesenheit zum Abgeordneten des kanadischen Unterhauses gewählt, konnte sein Mandat aber nie wahrnehmen, da ein Kopfgeld auf ihn ausgesetzt war. Während seiner Verbannung hatte er religiöse Visionen. Er war davon überzeugt, ein von Gott auserwählter Prophet der Métis und Begründer eines neuen Christentums zu sein., Riel begab sich 1884 in die heutige Provinz Saskatchewan, um der kanadischen Regierung die Missstände aufzuzeigen, unter denen die Métis litten. Der schwelende Konflikt eskalierte 1885 in der Nordwest-Rebellion. Nach der Schlacht von Batoche wurde Riel verhaftet, wegen Hochverrats vor Gericht gestellt und schließlich hingerichtet. An seiner Person spaltete sich die kanadische Bevölkerung in zwei Lager. In den frankophonen Regionen des Landes, insbesondere in Québec, galt Riel als Volksheld und seine Hinrichtung wurde überwiegend als politischer Mord empfunden. Die englischsprachige Bevölkerungsmehrheit betrachtete ihn hingegen als Aufrührer und Verbrecher. Diese Einschätzungen haben einer differenzierteren Haltung Platz gemacht, in der das religiöse Weltbild und die Familienstruktur Riels sowie die grenzübergreifende Kultur der Métis stärker Berücksichtigung finden. Heute gilt er als eine der wichtigsten historischen Figuren Kanadas und als „Vater Manitobas“., Jugendjahre., Die Red-River-Kolonie lag in Ruperts Land, einem riesigen Gebiet unter nomineller Verwaltung der Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC). Sie wurde hauptsächlich von Völkern der First Nations (Indianer) und von Métis bewohnt. Letztere sind eine durch Vermischung von Frankokanadiern, Engländern, Schotten, Cree, Anishinabe und Saulteaux entstandene Ethnie. Louis Riel wurde 1844 in der Nähe der heutigen Provinzhauptstadt Winnipeg geboren, als Sohn von Louis Riel senior (1817–1864) und Julie Lagimonière. Seine Großmutter mütterlicherseits, Marie-Anne Gaboury, war vier Jahrzehnte zuvor nachweislich die erste Frau europäischer Herkunft gewesen, die sich in Westkanada niedergelassen hatte. Seine Großmutter väterlicherseits, Marguerite Boucher, war eine Métis mit französischen und Chipewyan-Eltern, die Jean-Baptiste Riel geheiratet hatte. Louis Riel junior beherrschte Cree; ob er die Sprache seiner Großmutter lernte, ist nicht klar., Louis Riel war das älteste von elf Kindern einer hoch angesehenen frankokanadischen Métis-Familie. Sein einflussreicher Vater gelangte unter seinesgleichen zu Prominenz, als er 1849 eine Gruppe zur Unterstützung von Pierre-Guillaume Sayer organisierte. Der Métis Sayer hatte das Pelzhandelsmonopol der HBC missachtet, woraufhin er inhaftiert und angeklagt worden war. Sayer erklärte, nach indianischer Sitte nur Geschenke ausgetauscht zu haben. Das HBC-Gericht sprach ihn zwar schuldig, doch begnadigte es ihn aufgrund der Agitation von Riel und der Befürworter des freien Pelzhandels. Sayers Freilassung hatte das Ende des Monopols zur Folge. Nach diesem Ereignis war die Familie Riel in der Red-River-Kolonie allgemein bekannt. Riel setzte sich zudem erfolgreich für die angemessene Vertretung der Métis im Rat von Assiniboia ein, und er vertrat den Gebrauch des Französischen neben dem Englischen an den Gerichten von Assiniboia. Wirtschaftlich scheiterte er allerdings beim Aufbau von Mühlen zum Walken und Kämmen sowie zum Mahlen von Getreide, die er seit 1847 bzw. 1854 betrieb. 1852 wurde das Haus der Familie durch eine Frühjahrsüberschwemmung zerstört., Riels Eltern waren wie die meisten Métis streng gläubige Katholiken. Sein Vater war 1822 getauft und 1842 sogar kurzzeitig Novize bei den Oblaten in Mont-Saint-Hilaire in Québec geworden. Seine Mutter hatte ebenfalls vor ihrer Ehe Pläne, ihrer religiösen Berufung zu folgen, doch ihre Eltern drängten sie zur Ehe mit Louis senior. Aus diesem Grund unterrichteten römisch-katholische Priester in Saint-Boniface den ältesten Sohn, seine Eltern beeinflussten seine mystische Vorstellungskraft erheblich. Louis junior wird in den Überlieferungen der Familie als sehr großzügiges Kind mit einer starken Zuneigung zu seinen Eltern beschrieben. Seine älteste Schwester Sara wurde eine der „Grauen Nonnen“, wie man die Sœurs de la Charité de Montréal (Schwestern der Barmherzigkeit von Montreal) nannte. Sie war die erste Métis, die der Orden aufnahm und wurde, nachdem sie bereits die letzte Ölung erhalten hatte, 1872 ins Leben zurückgeholt, was man als Wunder deutete. In Erinnerung an ihre Großmutter änderte sie ihren Namen in \\"Schwester Marguerite Marie\\"., Als Louis Riel 13 Jahre alt war, wurde Alexandre-Antonin Taché, der Suffraganbischof von Saint-Boniface, auf ihn aufmerksam. Taché war bestrebt, talentierte junge Métis zu Priestern auszubilden, da kein Mitglied des ortsansässigen Klerus aus der Region selbst stammte. 1858 ermöglichte er Riel den Besuch des \\"Petit Séminaire\\" am Collège de Montréal, einer vom Sulpizianerorden geführten weiterführenden Schule in der Stadt Montreal. Der Lehrplan war auf Fächer wie alte Sprachen, Philosophie, Literatur und Theologie ausgerichtet, enthielt aber nur wenig Naturwissenschaften; im Wesentlichen entsprach er französischen Lehrplänen des späten 17. Jahrhunderts. Riel wird als guter Schüler beschrieben, jedoch fiel er wiederholt als unvorhersehbar launisch auf., Nachdem er vom frühen Tod seines Vaters erfahren hatte, der am 21. Januar 1864 verstorben war und den er seit dem 1. Juni 1858 nicht mehr gesehen hatte, verlor Riel zunehmend das Interesse an der Priesterausbildung und widmete sich vermehrt dem Schreiben von Gedichten und Fabeln. Am 8. März 1865, wenige Monate bevor er abgeschlossen hätte, trat er aus der Schule aus. Zwar führte Riel sein Studium im Kloster der Sœurs de la Charité de Montréal fort, doch wurde er bald wegen disziplinarischer Vergehen zum Verlassen aufgefordert. So war er beispielsweise zwei Wochen lang unentschuldigt dem Unterricht ferngeblieben, da er auf Arbeitssuche war. Er blieb in Montreal und wohnte ein Jahr lang bei seiner Tante Lucie Riel. Der Vater hatte Schulden hinterlassen; um die Familie zu unterstützen, arbeitete Riel in Montreal als Assistent des Rechtsanwalts Rodolphe Laflamme. Er hatte eine Liebesbeziehung mit Marie-Julie Guernon und verlobte sich am 12. Juni 1866 mit ihr. Guernons Eltern waren aber gegen eine Heirat mit einem Métis und die Beziehung wurde eine Woche später aufgelöst., Die juristische Arbeit langweilte Riel. Am Tag der Auflösung der Verlobung kündigte er seine Stelle bei Laflamme und verließ Montreal für immer. Wie einige seiner Freunde später berichteten, soll er in Chicago verschiedene Gelegenheitsarbeiten verrichtet haben. Dort soll er mit dem Schriftsteller Louis-Honoré Fréchette zusammen gelebt und Gedichte geschrieben haben, die von Lamartine beeinflusst waren. Nach einem kurzen Aufenthalt in Saint Paul (Minnesota) kehrte er am 26. Juli 1868 in die Red-River-Kolonie zurück., Red-River-Rebellion., Métis und First Nations bildeten ursprünglich die Bevölkerungsmehrheit in der Red-River-Kolonie. Als Riel dorthin zurückkehrte, musste er feststellen, dass der Zustrom anglophoner protestantischer Siedler aus Ontario die religiösen, nationalistischen und ethnischen Spannungen verstärkte. Die politische Situation war ebenfalls unsicher, da bei den laufenden Verhandlungen über die Übergabe von Ruperts Land von der HBC an den kanadischen Bundesstaat die staatsrechtlichen Bedingungen des Transfers nicht angesprochen worden waren. Dies hatte wiederum seine Ursache darin, dass Premierminister John Macdonald Annexionspläne der Vereinigten Staaten fürchtete. Deren Sprecher waren hier die \\"Minnesota annexationists\\", und auch die Vorlage der (nie zur Abstimmung gelangten) \\"Annexation Bill\\" vom 2.Juli 1866, welche die Besetzung Britisch-Nordamerikas verlangte, hatte diese Befürchtungen bestärkt. Noch mehr Aufsehen erregten die Angriffe katholischer Iren (Fenian Brotherhood) auf britische Grenzposten in den Jahren 1866 bis 1871, deren Ziel allerdings die Eigenständigkeit Irlands war., Der katholische Bischof Taché, der anglikanische Bischof von Ruperts Land Robert Machray und HBC-Repräsentant William Mactavish warnten in dieser erhitzten politischen Atmosphäre die Bundesregierung davor, vollendete Tatsachen zu schaffen. Trotzdem ordnete William McDougall, der Minister für staatliche Bauvorhaben, die Vermessung des Gebiets an. Die Ankunft einer von Oberst John Stoughton Dennis angeführten Gruppe von Vermessern am 20. August 1869 löste unter den Métis Unruhe aus. Sie hatten keinen gesicherten Rechtsanspruch auf das von ihnen bewirtschaftete Land. Die Parzellen in der Red-River-Kolonie waren gemäß dem Grundherrschaftssystem französischer Prägung streifenförmig parzelliert (vgl. Wirtschaftsgeschichte Kanadas).

Key highlights are summerised below, to see the full report please click ‘Download Report’. Office market Continues to see a limited new supply, which supported its performance. Looking forwards, the West is the most desired location in Hanoi and CBD Fringe is still the most sought-after location in HCMC due to the low available space in the CBD. Trends to watch: Flight to quality will remain a key theme. Long-term future-proofing is achievable by placing the workplace in a green building as the demand for green credentials increases. Rents are anticipated to remain stable in 2023 as landlords have begun to exercise caution in light of the economic headwinds. Retail market The retail sector is recovering relatively well from the pandemic's disruptions. CBD's rent hit a record high as the vacancy rate dropped. Retailers continue seeking high-quality retail space in the city centre and along prime high streets. However, as retailers try to navigate economic uncertainty and steadily rising costs, CBRE expects retailers to adopt a highly-disciplined approach to portfolio planning. Trends to watch: Retail space in CBD will continue to be limited, which may form a new trend as retailers will seek locations in non-CBD areas to launch pop-up stores while continuing to look for prime locations. The casualization trend that took hold during the pandemic will continue as more shoppers shift to working from home. Casualwear, followed by sportswear and sneakers, are the highest-ranking categories in terms of where we see the greatest growth potential. Industrial market Although supply chain disruption has now largely eased, companies are still looking to diversify risk by adding locations for sourcing and manufacturing. Industrial land performed well across regions. Trends to watch: The reopening of China is expected to boost Vietnam's economy. Due to limited landbank in prime locations, it is expected to see more vigorous activities in secondary markets. Tier-2 markets in the North draw attention from manufacturers and RBF developers. Green industry developments and renewable energy associated with environmental protections Residential market New supply in HCMC and Hanoi was the lowest in 9 years (excluding pandemic period). The high-end segment dominated the market, while the affordable segment was absent in both cities. The first half of 2022 witnessed the recovery of the residential market, and this trend had been expected to continue. However, turbulence in the latter half amidst the recovery has affected the recovery speed and market sentiment. Trends to watch: CBRE forecasts that difficulties will continue in 2023 with limited supply and low liquidity. There will be adjustments in the supply with fewer luxurious products and the focus will be on high-end and upper mid-end segments. The average primary price will stabilize in 2023-2024.}","completion":"Based on the information provided, the following conclusions can be drawn about the real estate market in Vietnam: 1.

The country is experiencing rapid demographic and social change, which is anticipated to support the effective demand for the residential real estate industry in the coming years. Vietnam, across various sectors, including construction and real estate, is rising with great potential among the Southeast Asian economies and is expected to continue its stellar growth in the coming years. The outlook for the Vietnamese residential real estate market is buoyant, mainly due to continued strong economic growth, rapid urbanization growth, and the construction of several mega projects in major cities such as Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi. The rising internet penetration and increase in disposable income by the middle-class youth population in Vietnam have surged the demand and sales proportion of residential real estate through online channels. This quick surge in individual wealth has made property affordable for many Vietnamese people, contributing to an increase in new developments and property prices. The residential market's focus has shifted from the high-end to the mid-value segments as urbanization has created an ongoing demand for housing in large urban centers. Furthermore, the country is now widely seen as the luxury real estate market hotspot, with a growing economy coupled with laws that have made it easier for foreigners to purchase the property.

The Vietnamese government's key initiatives include the housing law and other official directives to provide support and incentive for the development and management of social housing. It also has openness for investment by foreign individuals and organizations in social housing development. HCMC council implemented projects to increase the sources of pure land in urban and suburban areas and retrieved about 200 hectares (initially in 2008) of the site from the inner city to the suburban. The expansion of the availability of clean land is likely to increase the radius of social housing from the central area. According to the MoC, most social housing projects would be implemented in areas with large industrial parks, including Long An (310,000 units), Bac Giang (285,000), Bac Ninh (96,2 7), and Binh Duong (8,000). Social housing projects are also considered a priority in large urban cities such as Hanoi (136,000 apartments), Ho Chi Minh City (130,000), Haiphong ( 5,355), and Danang (19,360). KM assumed the implementation of the plan in stages, when approximately 700,000 apartments should be completed in the period 2021-2025, i.e. 5 % of the total demand, and 1.1 million apartments in 2025-2030, i.e. 85% Residential Real Estate In vietnam-GDP contribution of real estate in Vietnam To understand key trends, Download Sample Report Rapid Urbanization is Supplementing Housing Demand Urbanization will be an important driving force for rapid and sustainable socio-economic development in the future, and urban areas will make up the largest part of the country's economy in the coming years.

Die weiblichen Würmer leben sessil auf den Knochen von abgesunkenen toten Tieren und ernähren sich über eine Art Wurzelsystem von Nährstoffen im Knochen. Sie lösen den Knochen dabei durch Säureabsonderung auf und setzen so die Nährstoffe aus dem Mineraliengerüst frei. Bei der Verdauung der Fette und Proteine aus dem Knochen spielen endosymbiontische Bakterien eine Rolle, die in einem spezialisierten Gewebe des Wurzelsystems leben. Die mikroskopisch kleinen Männchen (Zwergmännchen) gleichen bis auf ihre Geschlechtsorgane völlig dem Larvenstadium und leben in großer Zahl in den Wohnröhren der Weibchen., Entdeckt wurde \\"Osedax\\" im Jahr 2002. Ein Wissenschaftler des Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute suchte mit einem Tauchroboter (ROV) nach Tiefseemuscheln im Monterey Canyon, fand jedoch durch Zufall, in drei Kilometern Tiefe, den Walsturz eines Grauwals, dessen Knochen dicht von \\"Osedax\\" besiedelt waren. 2004 erfolgte dann in \\"Science\\" die Erstbeschreibung der Gattung durch Greg W. Rouse, Shana K. Goffredi und den Entdecker Robert C. Vrijenhoek. Der Name ist dem Lateinischen entlehnt und bedeutet „knochenfressend“., Morphologie., Morphologie des Weibchens., Für die Gattung typisch sind die einige Zentimeter langen adulten Weibchen. Ihr zylindrischer Rumpf ragt aus dem besiedelten Walknochen heraus und liegt in einer durchsichtigen und gelatinösen Röhre, die von Drüsenzellen der Rumpfepidermis abgesondert wird. Die Rumpfwand beinhaltet neben dem Drüsengewebe auch Längsmuskulatur, mit der sich der Wurm bei Gefahr in seine Röhre zurückziehen kann. Im unteren Teil des Rumpfs liegt das Herz, von dem gut ausgeprägte Blutgefäße ausgehen. Wie für Bartwürmer typisch, besitzen adulte \\"Osedax\\" keinen Mund, Darmtrakt und Anus. Ins offene Wasser ragen von der Rumpfspitze vier Ärmchen, die fein gefiedert oder glatt (\\"O.\\" nude palp) sein können; die glatten Ärmchen der sogenannten „\\"O.\\" nude palp“ sind allerdings nur makroskopisch glatt, und zeigen unter dem Mikroskop eine gelappte Oberfläche. Die Ärmchen dienen als kiemenartige Atmungsorgane und sind meistens rötlich gefärbt, können aber auch grünlich oder fast weiß sein. Zwischen diesen Ärmchen befinden sich die Enden der länglichen Eileiter. Sie entspringen an der Basis des Rumpfs und verlaufen längs des Rumpfs in der Röhre, bis sie zwischen den Kiemen ins Seewasser hinausragen. An seiner Basis geht der Rumpf in eine rundliche Verdickung über, den sogenannten \\"ovisac\\". Ab diesem Teil ist der Wurm in seinem Substratknochen eingebettet. Vom \\"ovisac\\" gehen wurzelartige, grünliche Verzweigungen aus, die den Knochen aushöhlen. Eine markante Ausnahme von diesem Körperbau stellt die noch unbeschriebene Art \\"Osedax spiral\\" dar: Ihr dem Wasser zugewandtes Rumpfende hat keine Ärmchen, sondern endet spiralig gedreht. Ihre Eileiter ragen nicht aus dem Rumpf heraus., Der \\"ovisac\\" und die Wurzeln sind nach außen hin von einem einschichtigen Epithel umgeben, an das sich nach innen eine dünne und unauffällige Schicht von Muskulaturzellen anschließt. Zwischen diesen Schichten und einem einschichtigen, das Coelom umschließenden Peritoneum liegt eine dicke, grüne Gewebeschicht. Sie enthält die Bacteriocyten, welche die endosymbiontischen Bakterien von \\"Osedax\\" beherbergen. Die Bakterien liegen teils frei im Zellplasma, teils sind sie in Vakuolen eingeschlossen. Als weitere Organellen dieser Zellen gibt es nur einen Zellkern und sternförmige Strukturen unbekannter Funktion. Daneben existieren in diesem Gewebe auch bakterienfreie Zellen mit einem stark ausgeprägten endoplasmatischen Retikulum. Vergleichbare Gewebe zur Behausung von endosymbiontischen Bakterien sind von allen Bartwürmern bekannt und werden \\"Trophosom\\" genannt. Es ist jedoch unklar, ob die verschiedenen Ausprägungen von Bakterien beherbergendem Gewebe bei den Bartwürmern homologe Strukturen sind. Bei \\"Osedax\\" entsteht das Trophosom aus dem somatischen Teil des lateralen Mesoderms, bei anderen Bartwürmern meist aus einer anderen Region des Mesoderms und teilweise auch aus dem Entoderm., Morphologie des Männchens., Die Männchen der meisten \\"Osedax\\"-Arten sind mit 0,2 bis 1,1 Millimetern extrem klein. Ihre Körperorganisation entspricht der einer kürzlich angesiedelten Trochophora-Larve, mit einem Prostomium, einem nach hinten unklar abgegrenzten Peristomium und anschließend einem längeren und einem kürzeren Körpersegment, ohne erkennbares Pygidium. Zahlreiche larvale Merkmale sind noch vorhanden, wie der Prototroch genannte Zilienring an der Grenze von Prostomium und Peristomium. Mundöffnung und Verdauungstrakt sind nicht vorhanden, sie ernähren sich für ihre Lebenszeit von Dotter. Ventral am Vorderende der als Segment 1 zusammengefassten Einheit von Peristomium und dem langen Segment liegen Spermatogonien. Die von ihnen erzeugten Spermatiden reifen zu Spermien, die von ventral gelegenen, paarigen Zilienbändern an der inneren Körperwand der Männchen in den hinter dem Prostomium gelegenen Samenleiter befördert werden. Der Samenleiter mündet in das sackartige Seminalvesikel, in dem die Spermien angesammelt werden. Aus dem Seminalvesikel mündet die Geschlechtsöffnung der Männchen. Die Männchen behausen keine endosymbiontischen Bakterien., Eine Ausnahme stellen die Männchen von \\"O. priapus\\" dar – sie erreichen ein Drittel der Körpergröße von Weibchen ihrer Art und sind gleichartig in einen aus dem Knochen ragenden Rumpf und ein in den Knochen eingebettetes Wurzelsystem organisiert. Sie können ihren im Ruhezustand kontrahierten Rumpf auf ein Vielfaches seiner Ruhelänge ausstrecken, um über eine Geschlechtspore an der Spitze ihres Rumpfes in Nachbarschaft siedelnde Weibchen zu besamen. Außerdem besitzen sie wie die Weibchen ein Trophosom mit endosymbiontischen Bakterien. Die Vorfahren dieser Art hatten vermutlich bereits die sonst für die Gattung typischen Zwergmännchen; deren fortgesetzte Entwicklung bei \\"O. priapus\\" stellte damit einen \\"evolutionary reversal\\" dar, wie er nur selten vorkommt (siehe Dollosches Gesetz)., Ökologie., \\"Osedax\\" sind Meeresbewohner und besiedeln Knochen von Wirbeltieren, die nach ihrem Tod auf den Meeresboden abgesunken sind. Nahrungsquelle für \\"Osedax\\" sind die in der mineralischen Matrix (Gerüst) des Knochens eingebetteten Strukturproteine (z.B. Kollagen) und Fette. Die Tiere sind weltweit in Meerestiefen von 20 Metern bis über 4 Kilometern gefunden worden. Das charakteristische Substrat für weibliche \\"Osedax\\"-Würmer sind die Knochen von Walen., Ein Walsturz stellt auf dem Meeresgrund der Tiefsee einen enormen Nährstoffimpuls für das ansonsten nährstoffarme marine Sediment dar. Die Substanz eines Wals bildet Grundlage für ein ganzes Ökosystem, welches eine charakteristische Sukzession aufweist. Anfänglich fressen mobile Aasfresser wie Schleimaale, Schlafhaie, Grenadierfische und diverse Wirbellose innerhalb von maximal zwei Jahren das Weichgewebe des Wals. Ist das Skelett freigelegt, beuten opportunistische Krebstiere und Vielborster noch die Reste an den Knochen sowie das organisch angereicherte Sediment um den Wal herum aus. Die Knochen selbst enthalten bei Walen viel chemisch gebundene Energie, da sie für verbesserte hydrostatische Eigenschaften zu stark fetthaltigen Spongiosaknochen umgebildet sind. Die Fette und Kollagene im Walknochen werden unter anderem von spezialisierten, sulfatatmenden Bakterien ausgebeutet. In dieser von freigelegten Walknochen charakterisierten Phase besiedeln dann auch \\"Osedax\\"-Würmer das Skelett des Wals, teilweise auch mehrere Arten von \\"Osedax\\" gleichzeitig. Von einer bestimmten \\"Osedax\\"-Art besiedelte Walgerippe können nach nur wenigen Monaten vollständig von einer anderen \\"Osedax\\"-Art besiedelt sein. Im Monterey Canyon etwa befindet sich auf kürzlich freigelegten Walgerippen am häufigsten die Art \\"O. rubiplumus\\", die ein flaches und fadenartiges Wurzelsystem ausbildet und damit insbesondere die kollagenreichen äußeren Schichten des Knochens ausbeutet. Auf älteren Gerippen wird diese Art dann von \\"O. frankpressi\\" abgelöst, deren lappenförmige und robuste Wurzeln tiefer in den Knochen eindringen und damit insbesondere die schwammartig gebauten inneren, fettreichen Knochenareale ausbeutet. In den späten Stadien dieser Sukzession ist die noch unbeschriebene taxonomische Einheit \\"„O. spiral“\\" darauf spezialisiert, mit ihren Wurzeln bereits von Sediment bedeckte Knochenstücke auszubeuten. Die verschiedenen Ausprägungen des Wurzelsystems koexistierender \\"Osedax\\"-Arten deuten auf eine Nischenteilung hin, die ein wichtiger Faktor für die Artbildung bei \\"Osedax\\" sein könnte. Oft sind jedoch auch Arten mit nahezu gleicher Wurzelmorphologie auf einem Gerippe präsent, was eher für eine neutrale Theorie spricht., \\"Osedax\\" ist nicht ausschließlich auf Walknochen spezialisiert, sondern besiedelt auch die Knochen von Fischen, anderen Säugetieren, Vögeln und in seltenen Fällen Weichgewebe von Walen wie etwa das Spermaceti von Pottwalen., Fortpflanzung und Entwicklung., Weibchen von \\"Osedax\\" werden von den Männchen befruchtet, die sich in ihrer gelatinösen Wohnröhre angesiedelt haben. In den Wohnröhren älterer Weibchen leben einige wenige bis über 100 der mikroskopisch kleinen Männchen. Die Spermien der Männchen werden einzeln frei schwimmend und nicht als Spermatophore freigesetzt, es erfolgt eine noch nicht näher charakterisierte innere Befruchtung. Geschlechtsreife, mit Männchen besiedelte Weibchen setzen im Labor durchschnittlich 335 befruchtete Eier pro Tag frei. Anscheinend werden die Eier von Art zu Art unterschiedlich direkt ins freie Wasser gegeben, oder durchlaufen ihre frühe Entwicklung im Wohnröhrenschleim des Weibchens. Die Eizelle durchläuft eine ungleiche Spiralfurchung, und nach ein bis drei Tagen hat sich eine freischwimmende Trochophora gebildet. Diese kann aktiv schwimmen und etwa zwei Wochen von ihren Dottervorräten leben. Die Larven können sich dann auf Knochen ansiedeln, wobei die erste Verankerung vermutlich über zwei hakenförmige Chaetae (Borsten) erfolgt. Sie beginnen dann mit der Absonderung der gelatinösen Wohnröhre und der Ausbildung von Adultmerkmalen des Weibchens, wie et: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Osedax, Bartwürmer, Besiedlung, Nährstoffe, Säureabsonderung, endosymbiontische Bakterien, Tauchroboter, Walsturz, Bakteriocyten, Trophosom"},{"prompt":"Сейчас я напишу тебе программу на языке python, на входе которой словарь с данными, а на выходе рисуется картинка, содержащая таблицу.
