Since (a leq b leq c), we have (2a + b leq 3c). Therefore, [ c^2 leq c^2 + 2a + b leq c^2 + 3c. ] This implies that (c^2 + 2a + b) must be a perfect square between (c^2) and ((c+1)^2). Hence, [ c^2 leq c^2 + 2a + b < (c+1)^2. ] The only possibility is (c^2 + 2a + b = c^2), which implies (2a + b = 0). Since (a) and (b) are non-negative integers, the only solution is (a = b = 0). Thus, (c) can be any non-negative integer. 2. **Check the other expressions:** - For (a = b = 0), we have: [ a^2 + 2b + c = c, ] [ b^2 + 2c + a = 2c, ] [ c^2 + 2a + b = c^2. ] Since (c) is a non-negative integer, (c) must be a perfect square. Therefore, (c = 0) is the only solution. 3. **Consider the case where (2a + b = 2c + 1):** - If (c^2 + 2a + b = (c+1)^2), then: [ c^2 + 2a + b = c^2 + 2c + 1, ] [ 2a + b = 2c + 1. ] - Similarly, for (b^2 + 2c + a), we have: [ b^2 leq b^2 + 2c + a leq (b+1)^2, ] [ b^2 leq b^2 + 2c + a < (b+1)^2. ] The only possibility is (b^2 + 2c + a = b^2), which implies (2c + a = 0). Since (a) and (c) are non-negative integers, the only solution is (a = c = 0). Thus, (b) can be any non-negative integer. 4. **Combining the conditions:** - From the above analysis, we have: [ 2a + b = 2c + 1, ] [ 2c + a = 2b + 1. ] - Solving these equations, we get: [ b = 3a - 2, ] [ 2c = 5a - 3. ] - Substituting these into the first expression, we get: [ a^2 + frac{17}{2}a - frac{11}{2} = (a+1)^2, (a+2)^2, (a+3)^2, (a+4)^2. ] Solving these, we find the non-negative integer solutions for (a) are (a = 43, 1). These give the solution sets ((43, 127, 106)) and ((1, 1, 1)).

According to the given information, the cost price of 22 articles is equal to the selling price of 16 articles. So we can write the equation: 22C = 16S Now, we want to find the profit or loss percentage, which is calculated based on the cost price. First, we need to find the relationship between the cost price and the selling price for one article. From the equation above, we can find the selling price in terms of the cost price: S = (22C / 16) Now, let's find the profit or loss per article. If the selling price is greater than the cost price, there is a profit. If the selling price is less than the cost price, there is a loss. Profit or Loss per article = S - C Substitute S with (22C / 16): Profit or Loss per article = (22C / 16) - C To simplify, we find a common denominator: Profit or Loss per article = (22C - 16C) / 16 Profit or Loss per article = 6C / 16 Profit or Loss per article = 3C / 8 Now, to find the percentage of profit or loss, we divide the profit or loss per article by the cost price and multiply by 100: Percentage of Profit or Loss = [(Profit or Loss per article) / C] * 100 Percentage of Profit or Loss = [(3C / 8) / C] * 100 C cancels out: Percentage of Profit or Loss = (3 / 8) * 100 Percentage of Profit or Loss = 0.375 * 100 Percentage of Profit or Loss = 37.5% Since the selling price is greater than the cost price (as seen from the original equation), the merchant makes a profit.

When the members are divided into 8-people groups, 7 people are left. This means that N = 8k + 7 for some integer k. Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 7 to satisfy the first condition. The LCM of 6 and 7 is 42, since 6 and 7 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1). Therefore, N - 5 must be a multiple of 42. The smallest multiple of 42 that is greater than 5 is 42 itself, so the smallest possible value for N - 5 is 42. This means the smallest possible value for N is 42 + 5 = 47. However, we must also satisfy the second condition, which states that when divided into 8-people groups, 7 people are left. Let's check if 47 satisfies this condition: 47 = 8k + 7 To find k, we subtract 7 from 47: 40 = 8k Now, divide both sides by 8: k = 40 / 8 k = 5 Since 47 = boxed{8} * 5 + 7, the number 47 satisfies both conditions.

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2): [ (y^2 + yz) - (x^2 + xy) = (xz + x^2) - (zy + z^2). ] Simplifying, we get: [ y^2 + yz - x^2 - xy = xz + x^2 - zy - z^2. ] [ y^2 - x^2 + yz - xy = xz - zy + x^2 - z^2. ] [ (y^2 - x^2) + (yz - xy) = (xz - zy) + (x^2 - z^2). ] [ (y - x)(y + x) + y(z - x) = x(z - y) + (x - z)(x + z). ] 7. This equation is quite complex, so let's consider the possibility that ( x = y = z ). If ( x = y = z ), then: [ xy(x + y) = x^2(2x) = 2x^3, ] [ yz(y + z) = x^2(2x) = 2x^3, ] [ zx(z + x) = x^2(2x) = 2x^3. ] All three expressions are equal, so ( x = y = z ) is a solution. 8. Now, consider the case where ( x + y + z = 0 ). If ( x + y + z = 0 ), then: [ z = -(x + y). ] Substituting ( z = -(x + y) ) into the original equations: [ xy(x + y) = y(-(x + y))(y - (x + y)) = y(-(x + y))(y - x - y) = y(-(x + y))(-x) = xy(x + y). ] This holds true, so ( x + y + z = 0 ) is also a solution. Therefore, the solutions are ( x = y = z ) or ( x + y + z = 0 ).

An integer point is defined as a point where all three coordinates are integers. It is given that there are no other integer points inside, on the edges, or on the faces of the polyhedron. 2. **Possible coordinates:** Each coordinate of an integer point can either be even or odd. Therefore, for an integer point defined by three coordinates (x, y, z), each coordinate (x, y, z) can independently be either even or odd. Since there are two choices (even or odd) for each of the three coordinates, the total number of distinct combinations of the parities of the coordinates is: [ 2^3 = 8 ] 3. **Application of Pigeonhole Principle:** According to the Pigeonhole Principle, if you have more \\"pigeons\\" than \\"pigeonholes\\", at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.

Therefore, the product of the distances |MA|cdot |MB| is equal to the absolute value of the product of the parameters: [ |MA|cdot |MB| = |t_1|cdot |t_2| = |t_1 cdot t_2| = 2 ] Hence, the value of |MA|cdot |MB| is: [ boxed{2} ]"},{"prompt":"Show that we can find a set of disjoint circles such that given any rational point on the xaxis, there is a circle touching the xaxis at that point. Show that we cannot find such a set for the irrational points.","completion":"Given the problem: Show that we can find a set of disjoint circles such that given any rational point on the x-axis, there is a circle touching the x-axis at that point. Show that we cannot find such a set for the irrational points. 1. **Basic Inequality for Disjoint Circles**: Consider two disjoint circles touching the x-axis at points A and B with each circle having radius r. For these circles to be disjoint, the distance AB between the points at which they touch the x-axis must satisfy: [ AB geq 2r ] 2. **Generalization to Larger Radii**: Now, suppose a circle of radius R geq r touches the x-axis at point A, and another disjoint circle of radius r touches the x-axis at point B. The circle with radius r touching at A does not extend outside the circle of radius R, so the circle at B must also be disjoint from it. Hence, the distance AB must still satisfy: [ AB geq 2r ] Therefore, the fundamental constraint for disjoint circles remains valid regardless of the radii, provided the radius is at least r. 3. **Countability Argument**: Any set of disjoint circles touching the x-axis, where each circle has a radius (geq r), imposes a minimum spacing constraint. Therefore, such sets are countable due to the spacing and radii constraints. There would be only a countable number of such circles. 4. **Irrational Points**: Since irrational points on the x-axis form an uncountable set, it is impossible to have a disjoint set of circles touching at every irrational point. The countability of disjoint circles conflicts with the uncountability of the irrational points. 5. **Constructing Disjoint Circles for Rational Points**: Construct circles such that each circle touches the x-axis at a rational point. Specifically, any rational point on the x-axis can be expressed as ( frac{m}{n} ) in lowest terms. Assign the circle touching at ( frac{m}{n} ) a radius (frac{1}{3n^2} ). 6. **Ensuring Disjoint Circles**: Let two circles touch the x-axis at (frac{m}{n}) and (frac{a}{b}) with centers at points (P) and (Q) respectively. The distance (PQ) between the centers can be calculated as: [ PQ^2 = left(frac{m}{n} - frac{a}{b}right)^2 + left(frac{1}{3n^2} - frac{1}{3b^2}right)^2 ] For these circles to be disjoint, they must satisfy: [ PQ geq frac{1}{3n^2} + frac{1}{3b^2} ] Squaring both sides, we get: [ left(frac{m}{n} - frac{a}{b}right)^2 leq left(frac{1}{3n^2} + frac{1}{3b^2}right)^2 - left(frac{1}{3n^2} - frac{1}{3b^2}right)^2 ] 7. **Simplifying the Inequality**: [ left(frac{1}{3n^2} + frac{1}{3b^2}right)^2 - left(frac{1}{3n^2} - frac{1}{3b^2}right)^2 = frac{4}{9} cdot frac{1}{n^2 b^2} ] Thus, [ left(frac{m}{n} - frac{a}{b}right)^2 leq frac{4}{9} cdot frac{1}{n^2 b^2} left(mb - anright)^2 < frac{4}{9} ] 8. **Conclusion on Non-Intersection**: Since ((mb - an)) is an integer, the inequality (left(mb - anright)^2 < frac{4}{9}) implies ((mb - an) = 0), i.e., ( frac{m}{n} = frac{a}{b} ). Therefore, distinct circles touching at distinct rational points are disjoint.

Then, according to our restriction, we cannot pick any number between ( n+2 ) and ( 2n ). 3. **Pairing remaining numbers in the set for comparison and exclusion:** - Let’s consider the remaining numbers: [2, 2n+3, 3, 2n+4, ldots, n-1, 3n, n, 2n+1, n+1, 2n+2] - We can pair these numbers such that each pair satisfies one number is ( k ) and the other is ( k+2n ): [ (2, 2n+3), (3, 2n+4), ldots, (n-1, 3n), (n, 2n+1), (n+1, 2n+2) ] Notice that in each pair, the difference is ( 2n-1 > n ). 4. **Determine the maximum numbers we can choose without violating the condition:** We can pick at most one number from each of these pairs.

Our goal is to show that this sum S remains invariant under the given operation. Perform the given operation on a stone at position i (where i is not at the boundaries). - **Effect of Operation:** The operation changes the color of the neighboring stones but leaves the black stone unchanged. Therefore: - For positions j where j < i-1 and j > i+1, f(j) remains unchanged. - The sum of g for the positions i-1 and i+1 (g(i-1) + g(i+1)) also remains unchanged as the parity of the count of black stones to their right does not change. 3. **Determining Initial Configuration:** The sum S doesn't change regardless of the operations performed. We must determine the configuration where S can be initially computed and then use the conditions set by S being invariant. - Initially, all stones are white except one black stone, indicating that for most stones f(i) will be an even number (as they are surrounded by white except one black), making g(i)=1.

Let's denote the original time as T and the discount allowed at the original time as D. The discount allowed at double the time (2T) is given as 18.33.

According to the statement \\"the money obtained from each cow is exactly equal to the number of cows\\", we know that the total price of the cows is a perfect square. Given that the sheep were divided equally between the two, the number of sheep must be odd, because in the end, there will be one extra sheep and one lamb left. If each person initially received q sheep, then together they divided 2q sheep, making the total number of sheep (2q+1), which is an odd number. Since each sheep costs 10 yuan, the total price of the sheep is 10(2q+1) yuan. This number has an odd digit in the tens place and 0 in the units place. Assuming the price of the lamb is y yuan, which is a positive integer less than 10, and given that the total price of the cows equals the total price of the sheep and the lamb, we have the equation p^2 = (2q+1) + y. Therefore, p^2, this perfect square, has an odd digit in the tens place. Based on the properties of square numbers: if a number is the square of a natural number and its tens digit is odd, then its units digit must be 6. Thus, we know y=6. Since the price of the lamb is 6 yuan and each sheep costs 10 yuan, the person who got the sheep received 10 - 6 = 4 yuan more than the person who got the lamb.

We also have that N and O lie on Gamma because ON is a diameter. The points N, C, Q, O must also lie on Gamma in a particular sequential order, either N,C,Q,O or N,C,O,Q. 3. **Subtended Angles and Arcs**: - Since angle NQC and angle NOC are subtended by the same arc overarc{NC} of Gamma, by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, angle NQC = angle NOC. 4. **Relationship Between angle BOC and angle BAC**: - Because O is the circumcenter of triangle ABC, angle BOC is twice the central angle subtended by the arc overarc{BC}, which subtends angle BAC at point A. Thus, angle BOC = 2 angle BAC. 5. **Congruence of Triangles triangle OBN and triangle OCN**: - Since OB = OC (radii of the circumcircle of triangle ABC) and ON is a diameter of Gamma, the triangles triangle OBN and triangle OCN are congruent by the RHS (Right angle-Hypotenuse-Side) criterion, hence angle NOC = angle NOB. 6. **Half of angle BOC**: - Given angle BOC = 2 angle BAC and from congruent triangles in step 5, we get angle NOC = frac{1}{2} angle BOC = angle BAC. 7. **Proving Parallelism of Lines**: - From step 6, angle NQC = angle BAC. - This shows that A P parallel Q N.

We need to find the sum of the lengths of all red segments on the diagonal from the bottom-left to the top-right corner. 2. **Diagonal Length:** The length of the diagonal of the ( m times n ) rectangle is given by the Pythagorean theorem: [ text{Diagonal length} = sqrt{m^2 + n^2} ] 3. **Coloring Pattern:** Since the chessboard is colored in a checkerboard pattern, adjacent cells have different colors. The diagonal will pass through both red and blue cells. 4. **Red and Blue Segments:** According to the problem, the difference between the lengths of the red and blue segments on the diagonal is given by: [ |R| - |B| = frac{1}{mn} sqrt{m^2 + n^2} ] where ( |R| ) and ( |B| ) are the total lengths of the red and blue segments, respectively. 5. **Sum of Red and Blue Segments:** The sum of the lengths of the red and blue segments is equal to the length of the diagonal: [ |R| + |B| = sqrt{m^2 + n^2} ] 6. **Solving for Red Segment Length:** We have two equations: [ |R| - |B| = frac{1}{mn} sqrt{m^2 + n^2} ] [ |R| + |B| = sqrt{m^2 + n^2} ] Adding these two equations, we get: [ 2|R| = sqrt{m^2 + n^2} + frac{1}{mn} sqrt{m^2 + n^2} ] [ 2|R| = left(1 + frac{1}{mn}right) sqrt{m^2 + n^2} ] [ |R| = frac{1 + frac{1}{mn}}{2} sqrt{m^2 + n^2} ] [ |R| = frac{mn + 1}{2mn} sqrt{m^2 + n^2} ] The final answer is (boxed{frac{mn + 1}{2mn} sqrt{m^2 + n^2}})"},{"prompt":"Translate the graph of the function y = 2sin( frac {π}{3} x) cos( frac {π}{6} + x) (where x ∈ R) by shifting it to the right by frac {π}{4} units.

The key to solving this problem is to establish a quadratic inequality with respect to x based on the given conditions and the monotonicity of exponential functions, and then solve it by utilizing the graph and properties of quadratic functions. Solution Enhancement: Step 1: Rewrite the inequality. Given that {3}^{{{x}^{2}}-2ax} > {(dfrac{1}{3})}^{x+1} always holds true, we can rewrite the inequality as {3}^{{{x}^{2}}-2ax} > {3}^{-(x+1)} by expressing {(dfrac{1}{3})} as {3}^{-1}.

Since each pair of boys met at the shop, there would be at least ( binom{7}{2} = 21 ) edges. 3. **Analyze the graph:** Since ( |E| ge |V| = 21 ), by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be some overlap in the visits.

Hence, the largest integer (T) in this case would be 1, since the number 2 itself cannot be represented: [ T = 1 quad text{when} quad p_1 > 2 ] 2. **When ( p_1 = 2 ):** Suppose ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ) are ( k ) distinct prime numbers with ( p_1 < p_2 < cdots < p_k leq p_1^{2005} ). Let’s prove the following general result: If ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ) are ( k ) distinct primes such that ( p_i < p_{i+1} leq p_i^{2005} ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ) and ( p_1 = 2 ), then any integer between 1 and ( T_k ) can be expressed as distinct sums of proper divisors of (left(p_1 p_2 cdots p_kright)^{2004}).

So, the amount spent at the arcade is (3/5)A. The remaining allowance after spending at the arcade is A - (3/5)A = (2/5)A. The next day, John spent one third of his remaining allowance at the toy store. So, the amount spent at the toy store is (1/3)(2/5)A = (2/15)A. After spending at the toy store, the remaining allowance is (2/5)A - (2/15)A. To subtract these fractions, they need to have a common denominator, which is 15. So, we convert (2/5)A to (6/15)A: Remaining allowance = (6/15)A - (2/15)A = (4/15)A. John then spent his last 0.90 at the candy store, which means the remaining allowance (4/15)A equals 0.90: (4/15)A = 0.90. To find A, we solve for A: A = 0.90 / (4/15) A = 0.90 * (15/4) A = 0.90 * 3.75 A = 3.375. So, John's weekly allowance is 3.375.

These roots are x = -4 and x = 6. Therefore, M consists of all x such that -4 < x < 6. - For set N={x | x-5 < 0}, solving the inequality x-5 < 0 gives x < 5. Thus, N includes all x less than 5. - The union M cup N combines elements from both sets. Since M includes values from -4 to 6 and N includes values less than 5, their union extends to include all x less than 6. Therefore, M cup N = {x | x < 6}. - The complement of N in mathbb{R}, denoted overline{N}_mathbb{R}, consists of all real numbers not in N. Since N includes all x less than 5, its complement includes all x greater than or equal to 5. Hence, overline{N}_mathbb{R} = {x | x geq 5}. The final answers for part (1) are M cup N = {x | x < 6} and overline{N}_mathbb{R} = {x | x geq 5}. Part 2: Finding the Range of t for P subseteq M - For P={x | |x|=t} to be a subset of M, where M={x | -4 < x < 6}, the absolute value condition splits into two cases depending on the sign of x. - When P=varnothing, it means no x satisfies the condition, implying t < 0. - When P neq varnothing, it means there are values of x that satisfy the condition. This leads to two inequalities due to the absolute value: 1. t geq 0, because absolute values are non-negative. 2. -4 < t < 6, because t itself must be within the bounds of M. 3. -4 < -t < 6, because if |x| = t, then x can be t or -t, and both must be within the bounds of M. - Combining these conditions, we find that 0 leq t < 4, as t must be non-negative and satisfy both -4 < t < 6 and -4 < -t < 6. - Therefore, the range of t that allows P to be a subset of M is (-infty, 4), considering both when P is empty and when it is not.

From these equations we can derive the general form of the ellipse as follows: Divide x by 2 and y by sqrt{3}, squaring both sides of each equation, and adding them up, we get: (frac{x}{2})^2 + (frac{y}{sqrt{3}})^2 = cos^2theta + sin^2theta = 1, which simplifies to: frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1.

Substituting x=1 into the ellipse's general equation, we get: frac{1^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = frac{1}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1, which we can solve for y by isolating y^2: frac{y^2}{3} = frac{3}{4}, and thus, y^2 = frac{9}{4}.

When one of overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is overrightarrow{0}, it is clear that overrightarrow{a}//overrightarrow{b} holds true, so option B always holds true; For option C, we can set overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}=overrightarrow{0}, while overrightarrow{c} is not collinear with overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}, which demonstrates that this option does not always hold true; For option D, based on the definition of the operation overrightarrow{a}⊗overrightarrow{b}, we can obtain overrightarrow{a}⊗overrightarrow{b}=|overrightarrow{a}||overrightarrow{b}|sqrt{1-cos^{2}θ}, and cosθ=frac{overrightarrow{a}⋅overrightarrow{b}}{|overrightarrow{a}||overrightarrow{b}|}.

The original equation of the parabola is given by y = 2x^2 - 1. 1. **Shift 1 unit to the left**: To shift the graph of the parabola 1 unit to the left, we replace x with (x + 1).

Additionally, provide an example to demonstrate that h(x) is not necessarily a polynomial with integer coefficients.","completion":"1. **Establishing a Lemma:** We begin by establishing a crucial lemma that will help in understanding the relationship between f(x) and g(x). **Lemma:** If f(x) and g(x) are polynomials with integer coefficients and the same degree, and for any integer n, f(n) divides g(n), then there exists an integer constant c such that g(x) = c f(x). 2. **Considering the General Case:** According to the conditions of the lemma, for every integer n, there exists an integer a_n such that: [ g(n) = a_n f(n) ] Let's express f(x) and g(x) in general forms: [ f(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + cdots + b_{r-1} x^{r-1} + b_r x^r ] [ g(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + cdots + c_{r-1} x^{r-1} + c_r x^r ] Here, b_r neq 0 and c_r neq 0 because b_r and c_r are the leading coefficients. 3. **Finding Limits:** Dividing both f(n) and g(n) by n^r and taking the limit as n approaches infinity, we get: [ frac{f(n)}{n^r} = frac{b_0}{n^r} + frac{b_1}{n^{r-1}} + cdots + frac{b_{r-1}}{n} + b_r ] So, [ lim_{n rightarrow infty} frac{f(n)}{n^r} = b_r ] Similarly, [ lim_{n rightarrow infty} frac{g(n)}{n^r} = c_r ] 4. **Connecting f(n) and g(n):** From the equality frac{g(n)}{n^r} = a_n frac{f(n)}{n^r}, we infer: [ lim_{n rightarrow infty} a_n = frac{c_r}{b_r} ] Since {a_n} is a sequence of integers, and for the limit to exist, from some point onwards all a_n must equal the same integer c: [ a_n = c text{ for all sufficiently large } n ] 5. **Polynomial Relationship:** Thus, for all integers n > N, we have: [ g(n) = c f(n) ] This shows that any natural number greater than N is a root of the polynomial g(x) - c f(x). Polynomials have only a finite number of roots unless they are identically zero (if all coefficients are zero). Consequently: [ g(x) - c f(x) = 0 quad text{or} quad g(x) = c f(x) ] This proves the lemma. blacksquare 6. **Generalizing the Case:** If g(x) has a higher degree than f(x), we use polynomial division. Let g(x) = h(x) f(x) + r(x) where r(x) has a smaller degree than f(x): [ frac{g(x)}{f(x)} = h(x) + frac{r(x)}{f(x)} ] 7. **Considering Rational Coefficients:** Let a be the least common multiple of the denominators in the coefficients of h(x) and r(x). Define H(x) = a h(x) and R(x) = a r(x) such that both polynomials have integer coefficients: [ a g(x) = H(x) f(x) + R(x) ] 8. **Examining the Integers:** For any integer n, since f(n) wholly divides a g(n) and therefore R(n). Given R(x)'s degree is less than f(x)'s degree, R(x) must be identically zero: [ R(x) = 0 ] So we have: [ g(x) = h(x) f(x) ] 9. **Example and Explanation:** Consider f(x) = 2 and g(x) = x^2 + x. For any integer n, one of n or n+1 is even, making g(n) even: [ h(x) = frac{g(x)}{f(x)} = frac{x^2 + x}{2} = frac{1}{2} x^2 + frac{1}{2} x ] Here, coefficients are rational but not necessarily integers.

A fly sat on the top of a regular dodecahedron (a polyhedron with twelve faces) and decided to travel around it, moving along the edges of the dodecahedron, managing to visit every vertex without visiting any vertex twice and returning to the starting vertex at the end of the journey. Afterward, it tried to do the same with a rhombic dodecahedron, which is bounded by 12 rhombuses (see Fig. 1). Did it manage to do this? 1. The regular dodecahedron can indeed be manipulated into a planar graph. This allows us to examine the traversal by the fly on such a planar network. The edges of the polyhedron form the sides, while the vertices form the nodes, and the cells are the faces. 2. From Fig. 63, we observe a planar layout of the regular dodecahedron. The marked journey by the fly forms a closed path (Hamiltonian circuit) that does not visit any vertex more than once and successfully returns to the starting point. 3. Now, let's attempt to layout the rhombic dodecahedron in a similar planar form (Fig. 64). Simplifying this structure helps examine the feasibility of such a journey. 4. Observing the vertices of the rhombic dodecahedron: - The vertices can be divided into two classes: those where three edges meet and those where four edges meet. In Fig. 64, vertices where four edges meet are marked with black dots. 5. For the fly's journey, it must alternate visits between vertices of the two classes, ensuring no vertex is visited twice and checking whether it can return to its starting vertex. 6. The critical observation here: - There are eight vertices where three edges meet. - There are six vertices where four edges meet. 7. Since the fly must alternate between these two classes, it would encounter a mismatch because the fly can't end its journey adequately due to the unequal number of vertices in the two sets. Therefore, the structure of the rhombic dodecahedron doesn't support such a Hamiltonian circuit, respecting the given conditions for the fly's journey. 8.

The distance rho(A, B) between these cells is then given by: [ rho(A, B) = max {x, y} ] 3. Let us designate the marked cells as A, B, and C. According to the problem, the distance between each pair of these cells is 100, i.e., [ rho(A, B) = 100, quad rho(A, C) = 100, quad rho(B, C) = 100 ] 4. For each pair of cells, there exists a coordinate where they differ by exactly 100. Suppose A and B differ by 100 in some coordinate. Assume without loss of generality that A and B differ in the horizontal coordinate (abscissa). 5. Considering this setup, the abscissas of points B and C either differ by 200 or coincide. The first case is impossible since rho(B, C) = 100. Thus, their abscissas must coincide, and their ordinates must differ by 100. 6. To establish a coordinate system, let's assume: [ B(0, 0), quad C(0, 100), quad A(100, x) quad (0 leq x leq 100) ] 7. Now, consider a point X which is equidistant from A, B, and C with the distances being 50: [ rho(X, A) = 50, quad rho(X, B) = 50, quad rho(X, C) = 50 ] 8. For this condition to hold, the abscissa of X must be 50. If not, either rho(X, A) > 50 or rho(X, B) > 50 would occur. Similarly, the ordinate must also be 50. Therefore, the coordinates of X must be: [ X(50, 50) ] 9. Verifying X(50, 50): [ rho(X, B) = max {|50 - 0|, |50 - 0|} = 50 rho(X, C) = max {|50 - 0|, |50 - 100|} = 50 rho(X, A) = max {|50 - 100|, |50 - x|} = 50 , text{for} , x = 50 ] 10.

How many employees did the company have after hiring the additional male workers?","completion":"Let's denote the total number of employees before hiring the additional male workers as ( T ). Before hiring the additional male workers, the number of female workers was ( 0.60T ) because the workforce was 60% female. The number of male workers before hiring the additional ones was ( T - 0.60T = 0.40T ). After hiring 28 additional male workers, the total number of employees became ( T + 28 ), and the number of male workers became ( 0.40T + 28 ). The new percentage of female workers is 55%, which means the number of female workers is still ( 0.60T ), as the number of female workers did not change.

Check if 600 is a multiple of 20 or 25. Since 600 divided by 20 gives 30 (an integer) and 600 divided by 25 gives 24 (an integer), 600 is a multiple of both 20 and 25. 10.

The total distance driven to both friends' houses is 8 miles + 4 miles = 12 miles. Now, we know that Danny drives 36 miles between the second friend's house and work. This is the multiple of the total distance driven so far (12 miles) to get to work. To find the ratio of the distance driven between the second friend's house and work to the total distance driven to the first and second friend's houses, we divide the distance to work by the total distance to the friends' houses: Ratio = Distance to work / Total distance to friends' houses Ratio = 36 miles / 12 miles Ratio = 3 / 1 So, the ratio is boxed{3:1} ."},{"prompt":"Given: overrightarrow{a}=(sqrt{3}sin omega x, cos omega x), overrightarrow{b}=(cos omega x, cos omega x), omega > 0, let the function f(x)=overrightarrow{a}cdotoverrightarrow{b} and the smallest positive period of f(x) is pi. 1.

To find the intervals of monotonicity and critical points of f(x)=xln x, we first compute its derivative: [ f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(xln x) = ln x + 1. ] To determine the intervals of monotonicity, we analyze the sign of f'(x): - For f'(x) > 0, we solve ln x + 1 > 0, which gives x > frac{1}{e}. - For f'(x) < 0, we solve ln x + 1 < 0, which gives 0 < x < frac{1}{e}. Therefore, f(x) is decreasing in the interval (0, frac{1}{e}) and increasing in the interval (frac{1}{e}, +infty). The function has a local minimum at x=frac{1}{e}, since f'(x) changes sign from negative to positive at this point. 2.

This implies that ( b_k^2 equiv -1 pmod{13^k} ). 1. **Expressing the condition in terms of ( b_k ):** [ b_k^2 equiv -1 pmod{13^k} ] This implies that ( b_k ) must satisfy the congruence ( b_k^2 equiv -1 pmod{13^k} ). 2. **Order of ( b_k ) modulo ( 13^k ):** Since ( b_k^2 equiv -1 pmod{13^k} ), it follows that ( b_k^4 equiv 1 pmod{13^k} ).

For the case frac{1}{e} leq t < t+2, implying t geq frac{1}{e}, the function f(x) is strictly increasing on the interval [t, t+2].

This strategy ensures that the magician can identify the five additional coins in their correct state, even though the assistant cannot communicate directly to the magician when he enters. 3. **Step 3: Divide the Problem into Smaller Parts** - Divide the 27 coins into 9 groups of 3 coins each (a triplet).

The assistant will then leave one coin uncovered from each of these five triplets which predominantly show heads. - Example configuration where heads dominate: - ( {H, H, T} ) - covering any of (H,H) - ( {H, T, H} ) - covering any of (H,H) - and so on for five triplets. 6. **Step 6: The Determined Communication** - The trick lies in how the assistant decides which specific coin in each triplet to leave uncovered: - Define a rule. For instance, if the leftmost two coins in a triplet are heads, the assistant uncovers the left coin. This specific pattern will inform the magician about the positioning of heads within that triplet. - Possible rules for assistant: - Two leftmost heads: uncover the leftmost coin. - Two rightmost heads: uncover the middle coin. - Left and right heads: uncover the rightmost coin. - These rules allow the magician to infer the specific hidden heads coins in the other triplets based on the position of the uncovered coin. 7. **Step 7: The Magician’s Task** - When the magician enters, he sees the five uncovered coins and remembers the agreed pattern. - With the predetermined pattern, the magician deciphers the exact combination of heads positions in each triplet and thus guesses correctly which other five coins (still covered) will show heads. # Conclusion This combination and hidden message deciphering complete the focus trick successfully.

We are tasked with finding the total number of cards that will not lead to confusion upon reversal of the printed five-digit number. 4. **Step 1**: Identify the general form of a five-digit number: - Let the five-digit number be represented as (abcde), where (a, b, c, d, e) are its digits and (a neq 0). 5. **Step 2**: When the number is reversed, it becomes (edcba). To check for confusion, we need to satisfy the condition that: edcba neq abcde 6. **Step 3**: We consider that reversal confusion arises when both (abcde) and (edcba) lie in the given range and are distinct. 7. **Step 4**: The total number of five-digit numbers is: 99999 - 10000 + 1 = 90000 8. **Step 5**: Determine numbers that do not change when reversed: - These numbers are palindromes of the form (abccba), where (a,b,c) are digits and (a neq 0). 9. **Step 6**: Count the palindromes: - The first digit (a) has 9 options ((1) through (9)). - The second and third digits (b) and (c) each have 10 options ((0) through (9)). - Total number of palindromes: 9 cdot 10 cdot 10 = 900 10. **Step 7**: Subtract the number of palindromes from the total count to find non-confusing numbers: - Since reversal leads to confusion, the non-confusing five-digit numbers are the non-palindrome numbers. 11. **Step 8**: Perform the subtraction: 90000 - 900 = 89100 # Conclusion: Thus, the total number of cards that will not lead to confusion when reversed is: boxed{89100}"},{"prompt":"A player holds 13 cards of 4 suits, of which 7 are black and some are red.

To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 200 * 30% = 200 * 0.30 = 60 Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the discounted price of the shoes: 200 - 60 = 140 Next, let's calculate the total cost of the two shirts: 2 shirts * 80 each = 160 Now, let's add the discounted price of the shoes to the total cost of the shirts to find the total before the additional discount: 140 (shoes) + 160 (shirts) = 300 Erwan spent 285 after all the discounts, so the additional discount is the difference between the total before the additional discount and what he actually spent: 300 - 285 = 15 To find the percentage of the additional discount, we divide the additional discount amount by the total before the additional discount and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: (15 / 300) * 100 = 5% So, the percentage of the additional discount upon checkout was boxed{5%} ."},{"prompt":"Consider the set of points that are inside or within one unit of a rectangular parallelepiped (box) measuring 4 times 5 times 6 units.

Select a team ( O ). This team has played against 8 other teams (( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_8 )). 2. This selection breaks our 18 teams into two groups: - Group 1 consists of ( O ) and its 8 opponents: ( {O, A_1, A_2, ldots, A_8 } ). - Group 2 consists of the remaining 9 teams: ( {B_1, B_2, ldots, B_9 } ). Step 2: Consider All Possible Cases We examine two potential scenarios regarding the matches: Case 1: Match Between Groups 1. Suppose there was a match between the two groups. 2. Since ( O ) could not have been part of such a match, assume ( A_1 ) from Group 1 played against ( B_1 ) from Group 2. 3. Team ( B_1 ) has played 8 matches in total. Therefore, it could not have played against every other team in Group 2, meaning there is at least one team in Group 2 ( say ( B_2 )), against whom ( B_1 ) has not played. 4. Thus, teams ( O, B_1, ) and ( B_2 ) form a trio where no matches have occurred among them: - ( B_1 ) has not played against ( B_2 ) by selection. - ( O ) has not played against any team in Group 2 by initial setup. - Hence, ( O, B_1, ) and ( B_2 ) have not faced each other. Case 2: Matches Only Within Groups 1. Assume all matches occurred within their respective groups (Group 1 and Group 2). 2. This would imply each team in Group 1 has played every other team in Group 1, and the same for Group 2, forming complete round-robins within each group. 3. Consider Group 1: A complete round-robin among 9 teams requires each team to play 8 matches. 4. However, scheduling such a round-robin in only 8 rounds means one team would always be left out in each round, contradicting the assumption that every team has played every other team already. This contradiction demonstrates that Case 2 cannot occur. Thus, only Case 1 is viable, ensuring there are always 3 teams that have not played against each other. # Conclusion Hence, we have proven that in an 18-team championship, after 8 rounds, it is guaranteed to find at least three teams among which no matches have been played.

The volume of the smaller prism is the product of its dimensions, which is equal to the number of cubes: Volume = w * l * h = 128 Since 128 is a power of 2 (2^7), we can look for factors of 128 that are also powers of 2 to find the dimensions of the smaller prism. The factors of 128 that are powers of 2 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128. We are looking for three factors that multiply to 128. The most straightforward combination would be 4 * 4 * 8, since 4 * 4 * 8 = 128. This gives us a width of 4, a length of 4, and a height of 8. Therefore, the ratio of the width to the length and height of the figure created by the 128 cubes is boxed{4:4:8,} which simplifies to 1:1:2."},{"prompt":"For all complex numbers z, let [f(z) = left{ begin{array}{cl} z^{3}&text{ if }ztext{ is not real}, z^3 &text{ if }ztext{ is real}. end{array} right.] Find f(f(f(f(1+2i)))).","completion":"- Evaluate f(1+2i): Since 1+2i is not real, we use the non-real case, f(1+2i) = (1+2i)^3 = (1 + 2i)(1 + 2i)(1 + 2i).

This means that the student needed 130 marks (which he got) plus an additional 65 marks (which he fell short by) to pass. So, the passing marks can be calculated as: 130 (marks obtained) + 65 (marks he fell short by) = 195 (passing marks) Now, we know that these passing marks (195) represent 45% of the total marks (M). We can set up the following equation: 45% of M = 195 0.45 * M = 195 Now, we can solve for M: M = 195 / 0.45 M = 433.33 Since the maximum marks must be a whole number, we can round this to the nearest whole number, which is 433 (if we round down) or 434 (if we round up).

Let's denote the percentage of female students who are 25 years old or older as ( P ). Then, the percentage of female students who are less than 25 years old is ( 100% - P ). The number of female students who are less than 25 years old is ( (100% - P) times 0.60T ). The probability that a randomly selected student is less than 25 years old is the sum of the probabilities of selecting a male student less than 25 years old and a female student less than 25 years old, which is given as approximately 0.62. So, we have: [ 0.20T + (100% - P) times 0.60T = 0.62T ] Dividing through by ( T ) (since ( T ) is not zero), we get: [ 0.20 + 0.60 times (100% - P) = 0.62 ] Now, let's solve for ( P ): [ 0.60 times (100% - P) = 0.62 - 0.20 ] [ 0.60 times (100% - P) = 0.42 ] [ 100% - P = frac{0.42}{0.60} ] [ 100% - P = 0.70 ] [ P = 100% - 0.70 ] [ P = 30% ] Therefore, the percentage of female students who are 25 years old or older is boxed{30%} ."},{"prompt":"To make a living, Carl needs to drive a car for 2 hours every day.

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get: 3(kn + 2) = ln + 1 Expanding the left side, we get: 3kn + 6 = ln + 1 Now, we can see that 3kn is divisible by n, so the remainder must come from the 6. We want to find an n such that when 6 is divided by n, the remainder is 1. This means that 6 is one more than a multiple of n. The possible values of n that satisfy this condition are n = 5 (since 6 = 5*1 + 1) and any divisor of 5 (which is only 1, but that would not make sense in the context of remainders).

Similarly, the time taken by the second train to cross the man is ( t_2 = frac{L_2}{v_2} = 17 ) seconds.

Some numbers are both perfect squares and multiples of 3, like 3^2, 6^2, 9^2, 12^2, and 15^2 (5 numbers). Using the inclusion-exclusion principle: Total distinct numbers omitted = Number of perfect squares + Number of multiples of 3 - Numbers both perfect squares and multiples of 3 [ 17 + 99 - 5 = 111 ] Thus, when trying to find the 300th term in this modified sequence, it's necessary to extend beyond the 300th number of the standard sequence of integers to account for these omissions.

Additional conditions are required: - Checking (fleft(frac{3}{2}right) geq 0): [ f left( frac{3}{2} right) = left( frac{3}{2} right)^2 + (8 - 2m) left( frac{3}{2} right) + m^2 - 16. ] - Simplify: [ f left( frac{3}{2} right) = frac{9}{4} + (8 - 2m) left( frac{3}{2} right) + m^2 - 16 ge 0. ] - Additionally, the vertex conditions must hold: [ - frac{1}{2} (8 - 2m) > frac{3}{2} implies 2m - 8 > 3 implies 2m > 11 implies m > frac{11}{2}. ] 6. Combine the conditions: - From discriminant: (m < 4). - From other constraints: (m > frac{11}{2}). - No values of (m) simultaneously satisfy both conditions. # Conclusion: Thus, there does not exist a real number (m) such that the parabola and the ellipse intersect at four points.

This is because the derivative of f(x) with respect to x is positive for all x in (-infty, +infty). This property will help us determine the interval in which the root x_0 of the equation f(x_0) = 0 lies. Next, we evaluate the function at specific points to narrow down the interval where the root could be found. We start by calculating fleft(frac{1}{4}right) and fleft(frac{1}{2}right): 1. For x = frac{1}{4}, we have: [fleft(frac{1}{4}right) = 2^{2left(frac{1}{4}right)} + frac{1}{4} - 2 = 2^{frac{1}{2}} + frac{1}{4} - 2 = sqrt{2} - frac{7}{4}] 2. For x = frac{1}{2}, we have: [fleft(frac{1}{2}right) = 2^{2left(frac{1}{2}right)} + frac{1}{2} - 2 = 2^{1} + frac{1}{2} - 2 = 2 + frac{1}{2} - 2 = frac{1}{2}] Given that fleft(frac{1}{4}right) = sqrt{2} - frac{7}{4} < 0 and fleft(frac{1}{2}right) = frac{1}{2} > 0, we can conclude that the function changes sign between frac{1}{4} and frac{1}{2}. Since f(x) is continuous and increasing over its entire domain, this sign change indicates that there is exactly one root of f(x) = 0 in the interval (frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{2}). Therefore, the interval where the zero of fleft(xright), denoted as x_0, lies is (frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{2}). Given that f(x_{0})=0, it confirms that x_{0} must be within this interval.

Profit = 20% of 80,000 Profit = 0.20 * 80,000 Profit = 16,000 Selling Price = Original Price + Profit Selling Price = 80,000 + 16,000 Selling Price = 96,000 Next, let's calculate the broker's commission, which is 5% of the original price. Broker's Commission = 5% of 80,000 Broker's Commission = 0.05 * 80,000 Broker's Commission = 4,000 Now, let's calculate the total property tax paid over 5 years. Annual Property Tax = 1.2% of 80,000 Annual Property Tax = 0.012 * 80,000 Annual Property Tax = 960 Total Property Tax for 5 years = 960 * 5 Total Property Tax for 5 years = 4,800 Next, let's calculate the total maintenance cost over 5 years.

First, we need to find out how long it takes to travel 1 kilometer at 36 km/h. Since speed is distance divided by time, we can rearrange the formula to find time, which is distance divided by speed. Time to travel 1 km at 36 km/h is: ( text{Time} = frac{text{Distance}}{text{Speed}} ) ( text{Time} = frac{1 text{ km}}{36 text{ km/h}} ) To convert km/h to km/s, we divide by 3600 (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour): ( text{Time} = frac{1}{36} times frac{1}{3600} text{ hours} ) ( text{Time} = frac{1}{129600} text{ hours} ) Now, convert hours to seconds by multiplying by 3600: ( text{Time} = frac{1}{36} times 3600 text{ seconds} ) ( text{Time} = 100 text{ seconds} ) So, it takes 100 seconds to travel 1 km at 36 km/h.

Each day, the commander chooses a soldier, and we can visualize this choice as placing an \\"L\\" shape on the plane. This \\"L\\" shape divides the plane into regions where one region contains soldiers who are either taller and older or shorter and younger than the chosen soldier. 2. **Regions and Induction:** We aim to prove that the maximum number of regions created by 10 such \\"L\\" shapes is 81. We use induction to show that the number of regions (R) created by (E) \\"L\\" shapes is given by: [ R = 1 + E + I ] where (I) is the number of intersection points of the \\"L\\" shapes. 3. **Base Case:** For (E = 1), there is only one \\"L\\" shape, and it divides the plane into 2 regions. Thus, (R = 2), which matches (1 + 1 + 0 = 2). 4. **Inductive Step:** Assume the formula holds for (E = k). When we add one more \\"L\\" shape, it intersects the existing (k) \\"L\\" shapes at (n) points. Each intersection adds a new region. Therefore, the number of regions increases by (1 + n). This confirms that: [ R_{k+1} = R_k + 1 + n ] Since (R_k = 1 + k + I_k), we have: [ R_{k+1} = 1 + k + I_k + 1 + n = 1 + (k + 1) + (I_k + n) ] This completes the inductive step. 5. **Maximizing Intersections:** To maximize the number of regions, we need to maximize the number of intersection points (I). Let (A) be the number of \\"L\\" shapes in one orientation and (10 - A) be the number in the other orientation. The number of intersections between two \\"L\\" shapes of different orientations is (2A(10 - A)), and the number of intersections of the same orientation is: [ binom{A}{2} + binom{10 - A}{2} = frac{A(A-1)}{2} + frac{(10-A)(9-A)}{2} ] Simplifying, we get: [ I = 2A(10 - A) + frac{A(A-1)}{2} + frac{(10-A)(9-A)}{2} ] This simplifies to: [ I = -A^2 + 10A + 45 ] The maximum value of this quadratic function occurs at (A = 5), giving: [ I = 70 ] 6. **Total Number of Regions:** Substituting (I = 70) and (E = 10) into the formula for (R): [ R = 1 + 10 + 70 = 81 ] 7. **Pigeonhole Principle:** Since there are 85 soldiers and only 81 regions, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two soldiers must be in the same region. Therefore, these two soldiers will have the same schedule for every day.

Since they did a total of 110 situps together, and Diana did 40, Hani must have done ( 110 - 40 = 70 ) situps. Using Hani's rate, we can write Hani's total situps as: [ (x + 3) cdot t = 70 ] Now we have two equations: 1. ( x cdot t = 40 ) 2. ( (x + 3) cdot t = 70 ) We can solve the first equation for ( t ): [ t = frac{40}{x} ] Now we can substitute ( t ) in the second equation with ( frac{40}{x} ): [ (x + 3) cdot frac{40}{x} = 70 ] Solving for ( x ): [ 40 + 120/x = 70 ] [ 120/x = 30 ] [ x = 120/30 ] [ x = 4 ] So, Diana's rate of doing situps per minute is boxed{4} situps/minute."},{"prompt":"Let f(x) be an even function that satisfies f(x1)=f(x+1).

Since f(x) is an even function, we know that f(-x)=f(x). 2. Using the given condition f(x-1)=f(x+1), we can extend the function to the interval [-1,2]: f(x) = begin{cases} x & text{if } x in [0,1] 2-x & text{if } x in [1,2] -x & text{if } x in [-1,0] end{cases} 3. Now, let's find the intersection points of f(x) and g(x)={left( frac{1}{10}right)}^{x} within the interval x in [0,2]. Since f(x) is symmetric about the y-axis, any solutions in the interval [-2,0] will be mirror images of the solutions in [0,2]. 4. We can see that f(0)=0 and g(0)=1, so there's no solution at x=0. 5. Next, we can find the intersection point of f(x) and g(x) in the interval x in (0,1]. Since both functions are increasing in this interval, there can be at most one intersection point. We can use the intermediate value theorem to show that there is exactly one intersection point, as f(0) < g(0) and f(1) > g(1). 6. Similarly, we can find the intersection point of f(x) and g(x) in the interval x in [1,2]. In this case, f(x) is decreasing, while g(x) is still increasing. Since f(1) > g(1) and f(2) < g(2), there is exactly one intersection point in this interval. 7. Therefore, we have found two intersection points in the interval x in [0,2]. Due to the symmetry of f(x), there will be two additional intersection points in the interval x in [-2,0]. 8. Since g(x)={left( frac{1}{10}right)}^{x} is always positive and f(x)=x for x in [2,4], there will be no additional intersection points in the interval x in [2,4]. 9.

Clearly, for any (x in A), the set ({x}) is a good subset, thus good subsets exist. 3. **Maximizing the Size of (B_0)**: Among all good subsets, we select one with the maximum number of elements, denoted as (B_0). Let (left|B_0right| = t) and define (C = A setminus B_0).

Given the following four different sampling results: ①7, 34, 61, 88, 115, 142, 169, 196, 223, 250; ②5, 9, 100, 107, 111, 121, 180, 195, 200, 265; ③11, 38, 65, 92, 119, 146, 173, 200, 227, 254; ④30, 57, 84, 111, 138, 165, 192, 219, 246, 270; which of the following statements about the sampled results is correct ( )？ A: Neither ② nor ③ can be systematic sampling. B: Neither ② nor ④ can be stratified sampling. C: Both ① and ④ can possibly be systematic sampling. D: Both ① and ③ can possibly be stratified sampling.","completion":"Upon observation of the four sets of data: - Sequence ① and ③ could be from either systematic sampling or stratified sampling. - Sequence ② could be simple random sampling. - Sequence ④ cannot be from systematic sampling or stratified sampling. Therefore, we can determine that option B is correct. To verify the sampling types for each sequence further: - Simple random sampling is a basic sampling method that includes techniques such as lottery drawing and random number generation. In both simple random sampling and systematic sampling, every individual has an equal chance of being selected. - For systematic sampling, we expect a constant difference between each chosen number. This is seen in sequences ① and ③ where the difference between consecutive numbers is consistently 27. Thus, these sequences can be a result of systematic sampling. - For stratified sampling, the sample should be proportionate to the sizes of the strata (grades in this case). This is not clearly followed in sequence ④, which rules it out for stratified sampling. With that analysis, we can draw the conclusion, and we have: [ boxed{B} ]"},{"prompt":"The reciprocal of the HCF and LCM of two numbers are 1/14 and 1/312.

The HCF (highest common factor) of A and B is given as the reciprocal of 14, which means the HCF is 14. The LCM (least common multiple) of A and B is given as the reciprocal of 312, which means the LCM is 312. We know that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their HCF and LCM. So, we have: A * B = HCF * LCM Substituting the known values, we get: A * 182 = 14 * 312 Now, we can solve for A: A = (14 * 312) / 182 To simplify, we can cancel out common factors. We know that 182 is 14 times 13, so we can simplify the equation as follows: A = (14 * 312) / (14 * 13) Canceling out the common factor of 14, we get: A = 312 / 13 Now, we divide 312 by 13: A = 24 So, the known number A is boxed{24} ."},{"prompt":"On a farm, there are 2 cows, 3 pigs, and some goats.

This divides the plane into two regions: the inside and the outside of the circle. - We can color the inside region blue and the outside region red. Since there is only one separating boundary, the colorings are trivially different on either side of the boundary. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** - Assume for k circles (n=k) we can color the plane regions such that any two adjacent regions separated by a circle arc are of different colors. 3. **Inductive Step:** - Consider n = k + 1 circles. - Assume we already have a valid 2-coloring for k circles. Now we add the (k+1)-th circle to the plane. - This new circle will intersect the existing k circles, creating additional regions within the plane. 4. **Coloring the New Regions:** - When we add the (k+1)-th circle, it intersects the existing k circles in such a way that every new region it creates is adjacent to already colored regions. - For the (k+1)-th circle, if it intersects some regions such that we need to recolor to maintain the rule of different colors on either side of the circle, we can simply interchange the colors on one of the sides of the new circle. 5. **Ensuring Compliance with the Rule:** - This recoloring does not affect the property of other k circles because the new circle's boundary only needs to ensure that adjacent regions across it have different colors. - Given the induction hypothesis, every previously existing boundary between regions across any of the first k circles already respects the coloring rule. Adding and appropriately coloring the regions created by the (k+1)-th circle does not invalidate the proper coloring of previously existing regions. 6. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, we can color each region in the plane created by n circles (n geq 1) using exactly two colors, blue and red, such that two regions separated by a circle arc are always differently colored.

Can we design such a polyhedron for them in the first and second case?","completion":"To address the problem of finding a convex polyhedron with six faces, each being a strict trapezoid (a quadrilateral with exactly one pair of non-parallel opposite sides), and ensuring that each edge of the polyhedron is a base of one trapezoid and a leg of another, we will follow the reasoning provided. 1. **Constructing the Polyhedron with Strict Trapezoidal Faces:** We begin by trying to construct a polyhedron from six trapezoids. We start with one trapezoid and attempt to attach another trapezoid to each of its four edges. These additional trapezoids will also have one pair of parallel sides and one pair of non-parallel sides. After attaching these trapezoids, we have used five faces. 2. **Adding the Sixth Face:** To complete the polyhedron, we need to add a sixth face. This sixth trapezoid must fit the remaining free edges of the previous five trapezoids, ensuring that the resulting shape has 12 edges and 8 vertices where each vertex is shared by exactly three faces. 3. **Checking for Possibility:** Visualizing the structure, we see that for such a polyhedron (hexahedron) with the described properties, the vertices and edges must form a specific connectivity pattern. This pattern matches that of a typical hexahedron as illustrated in the provided figure (1st figure). 4. **Analysis of Edge Parallelism:** Suppose such a polyhedron is feasible. We label the vertices of one of the trapezoidal faces (A, B, C, D) such that (AB) and (CD) are parallel, while the non-parallel sides (AD) and (BC) intersect at point (P). 5. **Determining Parallelism in Adjacent Faces:** In the neighboring trapezoidal faces: - In the face (ADHE), (AD) and (EH) are parallel. - In the face (BCGF), (BC) and (FG) are parallel. Hence, in the face (EFGH), (EH) and (FG) should be non-parallel but intersect at point (Q). 6. **Contradiction Analysis:** Given that (P) and (Q) determine parallel planes, it follows that (AB) and (EF) would be parallel. However, if (AB) is a parallel base in one face, it cannot be a non-parallel side in another according to our initial conditions. This contradiction implies that constructing such a polyhedron under our initial strict requirements is impossible. Thus, **in the first case**, it is not possible to design a suitable hexahedron.

Start by taking a trapezoid in space, say (ABCD), and an exterior point (M). Connect (M) to all vertices of the trapezoid to form a pyramid. 9. **Truncation:** Cut the pyramid with a plane passing through an internal point (E) on the edge (MA), dividing it proportionally (e.g., at the midpoint). The intersections of this plane with the edges (MB, MC, MD) give us points (F, G, H) respectively. 10. **Resulting Faces:** The derived faces (EFGH, ABCD, AEHD, BGFH, etc.) naturally form strict trapezoids where necessary. The shape formed is a frustum with trapezoidal bases and sides, satisfying the requirement for having trapezoidal faces while relaxing the initial edge constraint.

The point through which the straight line passes is ( mathrm{A}(1, c) ). 2. **Transform the circle equation to standard form:** To convert the given equation into the standard form of a circle ( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 ), we complete the square for both ( x ) and ( y ): [ x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 2y - 7 = 0 ] We can rewrite it as: [ (x^2 - 2x + 1) + (y^2 - 2y + 1) - 1 - 1 - 7 = 0 ] This transforms into: [ (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 - 9 = 0 quad Rightarrow quad (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 9 ] Therefore, the circle has a center at ( (1, 1) ) and a radius of 3. 3. **Condition for tangency:** There is only one straight line which passes through point ( mathrm{A}(1, c) ) and meets the curve at only one point, which implies that the line is a tangent to the circle at ( mathrm{A} ), hence (mathrm{A} ) lies on the circle. 4. **Check if point ( mathrm{A} ) lies on the circle:** Since ( mathrm{A}(1, c) ) must lie on the circle ( (x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 9 ), substitute ( x = 1 ) and ( y = c ) into the circle equation.

Hence, r(x) = q(x) would be an appropriate choice of polynomial. 2. **Step 2: Considering p(x) as a non-constant polynomial** Let's proceed by examining the more complex scenario whereby p(x) is at least a polynomial of degree one. We exploit the algebraic fundamental theorem and complex numbers. If p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + ldots + a_k x^k, then there exist complex numbers alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_k such that [ p(x) = a_k cdot (x - alpha_1) cdot (x - alpha_2) cdot ldots cdot (x - alpha_k) ] 3. **Step 3: Use properties of complex roots** Since p(x) has real coefficients, if alpha_i is a root, so is its complex conjugate overline{alpha_i} with the same multiplicity. Therefore: [ frac{p(x)}{(x-alpha_i)(x-overline{alpha_i})} = frac{p(x)}{x^2 - 2 operatorname{Re}(alpha_i)x + |alpha_i|^2} ] remains a polynomial with real coefficients. Thus, p(x) can be factored into products of quadratic polynomials with real coefficients when they have complex roots. 4. **Step 4: Establish existence of a real polynomial r(x)** For a polynomial p(x) to be written in the form r(x)^2, it is necessary that every root's multiplicity in p(x) be even, and the leading coefficient must be non-negative. 5. **Step 5: Analyzing polynomial composition using the degree and leading coefficient** Given p(p(x)) = q(x)^2, it follows that: [ deg(p(p(x)) = k^2, quad deg(q(x)^2) = 2 cdot deg(q) ] Thus, deg(p(x)) must also be an even integer, and a_k must be positive since we require a positive leading coefficient in q(x)^2. 6. **Step 6: Indirect proof through contradiction** Suppose there exists an alpha_i such that (x - alpha_i) has an odd multiplicity. Given p’s even degree, there must be another alpha_{i'} ne alpha_i where (x - alpha_{i'}) also has an odd multiplicity. Since p(x) - alpha_i and p(x) - alpha_{i'} must be squares of some polynomials: [ p(x) - alpha_i = r_1(x)^2 quad text{and} quad p(x) - alpha_{i'} = r_2(x)^2 ] This implies: [ alpha_{i'} - alpha_i = (r_1(x)^2 - r_2(x)^2) = (r_1(x) + r_2(x))(r_1(x) - r_2(x)) ] Since alpha_i and alpha_{i'} are constants, r_1(x) + r_2(x) and r_1(x) - r_2(x) must also be constants, leading to r_1(x) being constant itself. This contradicts p(x) being non-constant, proving that all roots of p(x) have even multiplicity. 7. **Conclusion** By following the logical steps above, we conclude that if p(p(x)) = q(x)^2, there indeed exists a real-coefficient polynomial r(x) such that p(x) = r(x)^2.

Speed in m/min = (Speed in kmph) * (1000 m/km) / (60 min/h) Speed in m/min = 60 * 1000 / 60 Speed in m/min = 1000 m/min Now, let's calculate the total distance the train covers while crossing the bridge. The train has to cover the length of the bridge plus its own length to completely cross the bridge. Length of the bridge = 3.5 km = 3.5 * 1000 m = 3500 m The time taken to cross the bridge is 5 minutes, so the total distance covered by the train while crossing the bridge is: Total distance covered = Speed * Time Total distance covered = 1000 m/min * 5 min Total distance covered = 5000 m Now, we know the total distance covered includes the length of the train and the length of the bridge. So, the length of the train is: Length of the train = Total distance covered - Length of the bridge Length of the train = 5000 m - 3500 m Length of the train = 1500 m We are given that each carriage and the engine are 60 meters long. So, the length of the train is the sum of the lengths of the engine and all the carriages. Let's denote the number of carriages as 'n'. The total length of the train is the length of the engine plus the length of 'n' carriages, each 60 meters long. Length of the train = Length of engine + (Length of each carriage * Number of carriages) 1500 m = 60 m + (60 m * n) Now, we can solve for 'n': 1500 m = 60 m + 60 m * n 1440 m = 60 m * n n = 1440 m / 60 m n = 24 Therefore, the train has boxed{24} carriages."},{"prompt":"ving received his weekly allowance, a student spent 3/5 of his allowance at the arcade.

سازمان‌های جذب از آنجایی که افراد مذهبی متعصب جرأت ارائه قانون فرار از خدمت سربازی را ندارند، جنگ برای جذب محصلین مدارس مذهبی به تاریخ 26 ماه جاری در دیوان عالی کشور انتقال یافته است. همزمان، ارتش اسرائیل پیشنهاد می‌کند تا بار خدمت نظامی افراد جذب شده را افزایش دهد، بدون اینکه محصلین مدارس مذهبی را جذب کند. تفاوت دراماتیک بین درخواست‌های قبلی در مورد جذب محصلین مدارس مذهبی و درخواست‌هایی که در تاریخ 26 این ماه بررسی خواهند شد وجود دارد. این بار دیوان عالی نیازی به لغو قانون ندارد. شش سال از زمانی که قضات آخرین قانونی را که به فرار از خدمت سربازی محصلین مدارس مذهبی مقررات می‌داد، باطل کردند، می‌گذرد. از آن زمان آنها تحمل نامحدودی از خود نشان دادند و به پارلمان 6 سال مهلت دادند تا مجدداً فرار از خدمت را در قالب قانون تنظیم کند. در اواخر ژوئن، آخرین مهلت به پایان رسید و امروز هیچ پایه قانونی برای فرار از خدمت سربازی وجود ندارد. از آن زمان، قضات هشت ماه دیگر به پارلمان داده‌اند، اما این مجلس به طور شناخته شده با کودتای نظامی و سپس جنگ مشغول بود. \\"این یک درخواست ساده از فقدان صلاحیت دولت است\\"، آقای الیعاد شرگا، رئیس جنبش کیفیت حکومت و وکیل می‌گوید. علاوه بر این جنبش، گروه‌های اعتراضی برادران سلاح و مادران در جبهه نیز درخواست کردند. شرگا به تصمیم دولت برای دستور دادن به ارتش اسرائیل برای عدم جذب محصلین مدارس مذهبی‌ها اشاره می‌کند، علیرغم اتمام اعتبار قانون فرار از خدمت سربازی. \\"دولت تصمیم گرفت قانون را اجرا نکند و تمام کاری که دیوان عالی باید انجام دهد این است که بگوید این تصمیم غیرقانونی است.\\" مشکل این است که علیرغم سؤال حقوقی ساده، دیوان عالی هنوز به محدودیت‌های قدرت آگاه است. او می‌تواند تصمیم دولت را لغو کند، اما بسیار بعید است که با این کار حتی یک دانش‌آموز مدارس مذهبی را به خدمت سربازی بکشاند، همانطور که در گذشته، محصلین حتی زمانی که قانون جذب آنها را الزامی می‌کرد نیز جذب نشدند. در ماه ژوئیه، در پایان دوره تابستانی پارلمان، احزاب مذهبی متعصب قانون اساسی مطالعه تورات را روی میز مجلس قرار دادند که قرار بود به محصلین مدارس مذهبی وضعیت و حقوقی برابر با سربازان ارتش اسرائیل اعطا کند. انتظار می‌رفت دوره زمستانی پارلمان با تصویب قانون جدید فرار از خدمت سربازی شکل بگیرد. اما جنگ شروع شد و افراد مذهبی متعصب اعلام کردند که تا زمانی که جنگ ادامه دارد، قانون را پیش نخواهند برد. در عمل، حتی اگر آنها می‌خواستند آن را پیش ببرند، بسیار بعید است که ائتلاف موفق به جلب اکثریت برای تصویب آن می‌شد، و ممکن است تلاش فقط منجر به انحلال آن می‌شد. آنچه که از نظر افراد مذهبی متعصب تصویر را پیچیده می‌کند این واقعیت است که در این میان، خواسته‌های ارتش از افرادی که واقعاً خدمت می‌کنند رو به افزایش است و بنابراین تبعیض بین خون به خون روز به روز بدتر می‌شود. در هفته گذشته، وزارت دفاع نویس قانونی را برای افزایش خدمت سربازان رزمنده به سه سال و افزایش سن معافیت از خدمت سربازی احتیاطی از 40 به 45 سال منتشر کرد. تا تاریخ 22 این ماه، مهلت ارائه اعتراض‌ها به پایان می‌رسد. این اقدام به طور قطع بر نمایندگان دولت در توضیح اینکه چرا دولت افراد مذهبی متعصب را از خدمت سربازی معاف می‌کند، سخت‌تر خواهد شد. باید به یاد داشت که از لحاظ قانون اساسی، این موضوع آسیب جدی به مهم‌ترین جنبه ارزش برابری - تبعیض در حق حیات - است. آنچه تصویر را پیچیده‌تر می‌کند، این واقعیت است که ارتش تلاش می‌کند تا 1400 دانش‌آموز مدارس پیش‌نظامی و داوطلبان سال خدمت را پیش از سال داوطلبی جذب کند. این افراد جوان برخلاف محصلین مدارس مذهبی برای انجام وظایفی در جامعه مانند کمک به آوارگان یا کشاورزی جذب شده‌اند. در این میان، انجمن نِتْزَخ یهودا تلاش می‌کند تا جوانان مذهبی متعصب را داوطلبانه جذب کند. مدیر عامل یوسی لوی می‌گوید که در این مرحله او هیچ درهمی از دولت دریافت نمی‌کند. همانطور که به یاد دارید، 8 میلیون شکل تخصیص بودجه ائتلاف به سازمان‌هایی داده شده است که هماهنگ کننده فرار از خدمت سربازی محصلین مدارس مذهبی هستند. محصلین از مدارس مذهبی‌ها خارج نشدند و نرخ فرار از خدمت سربازی فقط افزایش یافت از زمانی که ارتش اسرائیل تلاش جدی برای جذب افراد مذهبی متعصب را آغاز کرده است، 15 سال می‌گذرد و نتایج فلاکت‌بار است. تعداد افراد مذهبی متعصب جذب شده که در سال 2016 به 1900 نفر در سال رسید، چهار سال است که در حدود 1200 نفر متوقف شده است. و هیچ نشانه‌ای از تغییر واقعی در این موضوع وجود ندارد. یکی از افسانه‌هایی که سیاستمداران اسرائیلی دوست دارند به رای‌دهندگان تعریف کنند این است که اگر فقط بر روی افراد مذهبی متعصب فشار نیاورند، دانشجویان مدارس مذهبی به طور گسترده‌ای جذب خواهند شد و همه چیز یک روند طبیعی است. اما واقعیت متفاوت است. 15 سال از زمانی که ارتش اسرائیل تلاش واقعی برای جذب افراد مذهبی متعصب را آغاز کرده است می‌گذرد و نتایج ضعیف است. تعداد افراد مذهبی متعصب جذب شده که در سال 2016 به 1900 نفر در سال رسید، چهار سال است که در حدود 1200 نفر متوقف شده است. اندازه دوره جذب افراد مذهبی متعصب حدود 12 هزار نفر است، بنابراین در مجموع حدود 10 درصد از دوره جذب هستند. برای مقایسه، فقط 14 درصد از مردان یهودی غیرمتعصب جذب نمی‌شوند که شامل مشکلات سلامتی و کسانی که ارتش از آنها چشم‌پوشی کرده است، می‌شود. از آنجایی که دوره جذب افراد مذهبی متعصب هر سال 4 درصد رشد می‌کند، این یک توقف در جا نیست بلکه یک عقب‌گرد است. سال جذب از ماه ژوئیه تا ژوئن ادامه دارد، بنابراین سال جذب 2022 کمتر از یک سال پیش به پایان رسید. مشخص نیست که چرا ارتش هنوز به طور رسمی تعداد افراد جذب شده در آن را منتشر نکرده است، اما برآورد این است که تعداد کماکان 1200 نفر باشد. اما در عمل، وضعیت بدتر است. تال یعقوب ودمنی، رئیس اداره برنامه‌ریزی و مدیریت نیروی انسانی در ستاد نیروی هوایی (توماکا)، در ماه مه به کمیته فرعی کمیته امور خارجه و دفاع در زمینه منابع انسانی اعلام کرد که چندصد نفر از افراد مذهبی متعصب جذب شده در واقع خارج شده‌اند و فقط بر اساس تعریف فنی قانونی به عنوان افراد مذهبی متعصب در نظر گرفته می‌شوند. وضعیت راه حل جایگزین برای خدمت افراد مذهبی متعصب، یعنی خدمت مدنی، بدتر است. بر اساس آمارنامه جامعه مذهبی متعصب موسسه دموکراسی اسرائیل، تعداد محصلین مدارس مذهبی داوطلب برای خدمت مدنی در یک سال از 1090 نفر در سال 2011 به 570 نفر در سال 2022 و 480 نفر در سال جذب 2023 کاهش یافته است. در پی جنگ، مقالات زیادی درباره جذب حدود هزار نفر از افراد مذهبی متعصب به سپاه احتیاط پس از آموزش کوتاه منتشر شد. اما حداقل در این مرحله هیچ نشانه‌ای از تغییر در مسئله واقعی - جذب جوانان مذهبی متعصب برای خدمت کامل - وجود ندارد. کسانی که می‌خواهند می‌توانند با نامه غیرمنتظره‌ای که موشه اربل از حزب شاس وزیر کشور در هفته گذشته به یوسی لوی، سرهنگ دوم بازنشسته و مدیرعامل انجمن نتزخ یهودا، که فعال در زمینه جذب افراد مذهبی متعصب است، فرستاد، تسلی یابند. اربل برخلاف موضع سنتی افراد مذهبی متعصب نوشت: \\"وظیفه اصلی شما در این زمان ادغام افراد مذهبی متعصب در خدمت رزمی طولانی و معنادار به دلیل جنگ است.\\" او همچنین گفت: \\"خوشحال شدم که در گفتگوی امروز ما درباره افزایش قابل توجه در علاقه به جذب برای خدمت رزمی در میان جوانان از جامعه مذهبی متعصب برای تاریخ جذب نزدیک، که انتظار می‌رود به طور قابل توجهی بزرگتر از سال گذشته باشد، شنیدم.\\" در طول سال‌ها امیدهای زیادی برای تغییر در الگوهای جذب افراد مذهبی متعصب وجود داشت، اما همه آنها به دلیل هزینه اجتماعی زیادی که فرد جذب شده مانند کاهش ارزش خانواده در ازدواج پرداخت می‌کرد، رنگ باختند. زمانی که افزایشی وجود داشته باشد، می‌توان باور کرد. قانون تعویق خدمت سربازی برای محصلین مدارس مذهبی، تعویق خدمت را تا سن 26 سالگی برای دریافت معافیت کامل به آنها می‌دهد. چهار نفر از هر پنج دانش‌آموز مدارس مذهبی متأهل (که اَبْراک نامیده می‌شوند) از خدمت نظامی کامل معاف هستند و با این وجود در مدارس مذهبی باقی می‌مانند. به این معنی که دستور اجتماعی افراد مذهبی متعصب برای یادگیری، حتی در غیاب تهدید خدمت نظامی پابرجا است. حدود 20 سال است که در مورد فرار از خدمت سربازی وضعیت پینگ پونگی بین پارلمان و دیوان عالی حاکم است. پارلمان یک قانون فرار از خدمت سربازی یا دیگری را تصویب می‌کند، دیوان عالی پس از چند سال بررسی، قانون را لغو می‌کند و این چرخه تکرار می‌شود. در آخرین مورد، دیوان عالی در سال 2017 قانون را لغو کرد و از آن زمان پارلمان موفق به تصویب قانون جایگزین نشده است، از جمله به دلیل اصرار روحانیون حزب آگودات یسرائل حسیدی بر تصویب قانون بدون هیچ گونه شکافی. در دولت فعلی، احزاب مذهبی متعصب در حمایت از کودتای نظامی به منظور تصویب بند غلبه که به آنها امکان می‌دهد از قانون فرار از خدمت سربازی پس از تصویب آن محافظت کنند، نقش داشتند. به عنوان جایگزین، آنها خواستار تصویب \\"قانون اساسی مطالعه تورات\\" شدند که به فرار از خدمت سربازی جایگاه قانون اساسی محافظ بدهد. بر اساس توضیحات پیشنهاد قانون: \\"مطالعه تورات به عنوان یک ارزش اساسی شناخته خواهد شد. حقوق محصلین مدارس مذهبی برابر با حقوق کسانی خواهد بود که خدمت مهمی را انجام داده‌اند.\\" هرچه مبارزه برای کودتا پیشرفت می‌کرد، روشن می‌شد که افراد مذهبی متعصب در تصویب راه حل قانون اساسی با دشواری مواجه خواهند شد. در دوره فعلی پارلمان، آنها حداقل باید قانون معمول فرار از خدمت سربازی را تصویب می‌کردند اما آنگاه جنگ آغاز شد. البته خواسته احزاب مذهبی متعصب همیشه این بوده است که در این قانون هیچ سهمیه، هدف جذب یا تحریم‌هایی وجود نداشته باشد. در ابتدای ژوئیه سال گذشته، آخرین تمدید زمانی که دیوان عالی به پارلمان داده بود، به پایان رسید و قانون تعویق خدمت سربازی فاقد هرگونه اعتبار قانونی باقی ماند. در ماه ژوئن، دولت تصمیمی گرفت که به ارتش دستور داد از جذب محصلین مدارس مذهبی خودداری کند. در تاریخ 26 این ماه، دیوان عالی سه درخواست را که خواستار دستور به جذب محصلین مدارس مذهبی بودند، بررسی خواهد کرد. این درخواست ها توسط گروه های اعتراضی مادران در جبهه، برادران سلاح و جنبش کیفیت حکومت ارائه شده است. به گفته وکیل دفنا هولتز لاکنر، که از مادران در جبهه نمایندگی می کند، \\"دولت می آید و به مسئولان می گوید که قانون را اجرا نکنید. این بحران قانون اساسی است.\\" در درخواست برادران سلاح گفته شده است که تصمیم دولت برای عدم جذب محصلین مدارس مذهبی در حال حاضر \\"انگشت فرو بردن در چشم حاکمیت قانون\\" است. هولتز لاکنر اشاره می کند که پیش نویس قانون جدید جذب که درخواست تمدید دوره خدمت سربازان رزمنده را دارد، \\"تبعیض را بسیار عمیق تر می کند.\\" در نهایت به جای تمدید خدمت، می توان به سادگی محصلین مدارس مذهبی را جذب کرد. بدون جذب افراد مذهبی متعصب و بدون برآورد اقتصادی: لنز مسدود وزارت دفاع وزارت دفاع درخواست تمدید خدمت سربازی و افزایش بار بر دوش سربازان احتیاطی را دارد - اما از امکان جذب افراد مذهبی متعصب یا زنان مذهبی غفلت می کند. علاوه بر این، وزارتخانه مالی از جزئیات پیشنهاد مطلع نشده است؛ زیان به اقتصاد و هزینه بودجه ای هنوز مشخص نیست - و ممکن است به میلیاردها شکل در سال برسد. دو پیش نویس قانون بسیار انفجاری دیروز (پنجشنبه) توسط وزارت دفاع روی میز پارلمان گذاشته شد: اولی به تمدید خدمت سربازی مردان و زنان در برخی مشاغل، از جمله آنهایی که در حال حاضر در حال خدمت هستند، از 32 ماه به 36 ماه می پردازد. دومی، به افزایش معنادار بار خدمت احتیاطی بر شهروندان خدمت کننده مربوط می شود، با این درخواست جدید از ارتش اسرائیل که به جای اینکه رزمندگان حدود 54 روز در طول سه سال خدمت احتیاطی انجام دهند، آنها هر سال 42 روز خدمت احتیاطی، فرماندهان حدود 70 روز خدمت احتیاطی و افسران حدود 84 روز خدمت احتیاطی در سال انجام دهند. این به آن معناست که رزمندگان احتیاطی تا سن 46 سالگی حدود 1050 روز خدمت احتیاطی انجام خواهند داد، که تقریباً معادل سه سال دیگر خدمت است. افسران رزمی دو برابر این مقدار، یعنی حدود شش سال خدمت احتیاطی تا سن 45 سالگی را انجام خواهند داد و این علاوه بر خدمت سربازی و دائمی آنهاست. فقط آنچه جالب است - به کانال اقتصادی تلگرام بپیوندید این اقدامات بسیار سختگیرانه هستند و سبب تحریک سیستم سیاسی و جامعه شده اند. نگران کننده ترین بخش این دستورات، چیزهایی است که در آنها وجود ندارد - جذب افراد مذهبی متعصب، که همچنان از حمل این بار معاف خواهند بود و حتی بودجه های بزرگتری از همیشه دریافت خواهند کرد. خواندن پیش نویس قانون خدمت دفاعی حتی می تواند آرام ترین افراد را عصبانی کند: \\"این اقدام منجر به افزایش قابل توجهی در نیروی رزمنده ارتش اسرائیل و سیستم های پشتیبان رزمی خواهد شد، افزایش قابل توجهی که به هیچ روش دیگری قابل دستیابی نیست\\". در حالی که هر شخصی که در اسرائیل زندگی می کند، می داند که می توان نیروی رزمی ارتش را با صدها هزار سرباز قوی و سالم که در حال حاضر به دلیل توافقات سیاسی تاریخی جذب نمی شوند، افزایش داد. در بخش دیگری از پیش نویس قانون آمده است که \\"اعمال این طرح پیشنهادی آینده نگرانه خسارتی به میزان نامتعارف به خودمختاری و توانایی سربازان برای برنامه ریزی مسیر زندگی خود وارد نخواهد کرد، با توجه به این که این امر مشمول فقط یک تمدید 4 ماهه محدود خواهد بود\\". تعجب آور است که این متن که درباره \\"آسیب معقولانه به خودمختاری\\" صحبت می کند، در پیشنهاد قانونی دولتی در زمانی نوشته شده است که جمعیت های کامل وجود دارند که خودمختاری آن ها به یک گاو مقدس تبدیل شده که نباید به آن دست زد. در ادامه آن آمده است که گزینه های دیگری مانند افزایش ارتش دائمی یا احتیاطی در نظر گرفته شده است، اما در آنجا حتی به صورت کنایه ای به امکان افزایش تعداد کل افراد جذب شده اشاره نشده است. ارتش همچنین از پرداختن به سایر مسائل انفجاری مانند لغو معافیت از خدمت سربازی برای زنان مذهبی، لغو مدارس مذهبی توافقی یا حتی بررسی جذب سربازان از جامعه عربی خودداری کرده است. افزایش مدت خدمت سربازی نظامی و احتیاطی نه تنها به دلایل عدم برابری بلکه به دلایل اقتصادی نیز مشکل‌ساز است. اصلاحات قانونی که توسط وزارت دفاع و ارتش اسرائیل آغاز شد، به صورت یکجانبه و بدون مشورت با کارشناسان حرفه‌ای در وزارتخانه مالی، نه در اداره بودجه و نه در اداره حسابرسی عمومی انجام شد - و این حتی در حالی است که این پیشنهادات قانونی دارای آثار اقتصادی دراماتیک هستند، هم از نظر هزینه های بودجه ای و هم از نظر آسیب بالقوه به اقتصاد. با این وجود، به اطلاع اقتصاد رسیده است که پیش نویس قوانین در هفته گذشته به آنها ارسال شد و وزارت دفاع عجله کرد آنها را روی میز پارلمان بگذارد تا از وضعیتی جلوگیری کند که مجبور شوند دستورات خدمت احتیاطی 8 روزه برای ذخیره نیروها را تمدید کنند. به هر حال، حتی اگر وزارتخانه مالی می‌دانست که ارتش قصد دارد این موضوع را به صورت یکجانبه اعلام کند - واقعیت این است که اصلاحات قانونی بدون هیچ کار اقتصادی از جانب وزارتخانه روی میز پارلمان قرار گرفته‌اند. پویایی بین این دو وزارتخانه مهم بخشی از یک مبارزه بزرگتر است که این روزها در مورد طرح توانمندسازی 100 میلیارد شکلی در جریان است که قرار است طرفین در چارچوب کمیته بررسی بودجه دفاعی که در این روزها تشکیل می‌شود، بر سر آن توافق کنند. مقامات ارشد وزارتخانه مالی نگران رفتار اقتصادی غیرمسئولانه ارتش هستند که درک نمی‌کند آثار اقتصادی پیش‌بینی شده سیاست اعتبار آزاد است که در جریان جنگ به آن داده شده است. بانک اسرائیل نیز معتقد است افزایش بودجه دفاعی بزرگترین چالش اقتصادی است که اسرائیل با آرام شدن نبردها با آن مواجه خواهد شد. از آنجایی که پیش نویس‌های قانونی بدون رسیدن به توافق با وزارتخانه مالی منتشر شدند، وضعیت غیرعادی پدید آمده که در اداره بودجه، اداره حسابرسی عمومی و اداره اقتصاددان ارشد به سادگی نمی‌دانند چه برآورد اقتصادی از معنای این پیشنهاد ارائه دهند، نه از نظر هزینه بودجه ای و نه از نظر آسیب به تولید ناخالص داخلی. آنچه در آنجا می‌دانند بگویند این است که مقیاس آن میلیاردها شکل در سال، نه صدها میلیون است. اصل کلی در وزارتخانه مالی این است که هزینه بودجه ای مستقیم جذب یک سرباز احتیاطی حدود 800 شکل در روز تخمین زده می‌شود که شامل هزینه دستمزد و مزایای ملحقه است. اگر این مبلغ را در 18 روز متوسط خدمت احتیاطی که هر سرباز احتیاطی در سال انجام می‌دهد ضرب کنیم، هزینه بودجه ای مستقیم 14.4 هزار شکل به دست می‌آید. ارتش اسرائیل به دلایل امنیتی اطلاعاتی را در مورد تعداد نیروهای خدمت احتیاطی در اختیار قرار نمی‌دهد، اما پردازش داده‌های مرکز آمار به وسیله اقتصاددان ارشد نشان می‌دهد که 148 هزار نفر از نیروهای احتیاطی در دسامبر گذشته از محل کارشان غایب بودند. اگر فقط همین تعداد نیروی انسانی را که کمتر از کل ارتش احتیاطی است (در ابتدای جنگ گفته شد تعداد نیروهای احتیاطی جذب شده حدود 350 هزار نفر بود) بگیریم و آن را در هزینه جذب یک \\"سرباز ساده\\" ضرب کنیم، هزینه بودجه ای مستقیم 2.1 میلیارد شکل به دست می‌آید. در صورتی که نیروهای احتیاطی واقعاً حدود 42 روز در سال خدمت کنند، این مبلغ 2.3 برابر خواهد شد و به 4.9 میلیارد شکل خواهد رسید، افزایش بودجه ای مستقیم 2.8 میلیارد شکل با یک محاسبه محتاطانه که شامل کل نیروی رزمنده و فرماندهان و افسرانی که قرار است بیشتر خدمت کنند، نمی‌شود. باید اشاره کرد که میلیاردها شکل دیگری که وزارت دفاع مجبور است به سربازان احتیاطی پرداخت کند، از تولید ناخالص داخلی که همان نیروهای احتیاطی در محل کارشان تولید می‌کردند، کسر می‌شود. در سیستم امنیتی درخواست برای آرام کردن نگرانی های اقتصادی وجود دارد و آنها استدلال می کنند که واقعیت این که امکان بسیج رزرویست ها برای روزهای زیادی وجود دارد، به این معنی نیست که در عمل، زمانی که تهدید امنیتی آرام شود، مثلا در سال های 2025 یا 2026، این اتفاق خواهد افتاد. با این حال، از تجربه گذشته، ارتش دفاع اسرائیل سازمانی است که می خواهد از منابعی که در اختیار دارد - چه بودجه و چه نیروی انسانی - به طور حداکثری استفاده کند. در وزارت دارایی ادعا می کنند که هزینه افزایش خدمت منظم، که شامل افزایش حقوق سربازان در ماه های آخر خدمت آنها نیز می شود، چندین میلیارد شکل را افزایش خواهد داد، اما در ارتش دفاع اسرائیل معتقدند این هزینه صدها میلیون شکل در سال خواهد بود. هزینه های افزایش نیروی انسانی در ارتش دفاع اسرائیل، که در ادامه شامل افزایش نیروهای منظم نیز خواهد شد، قرار است از برنامه تقویت بیاید. علاوه بر آسیب اقتصادی مستقیم افزایش روزهای رزرو، این اقدام پیامدهای اقتصادی غیرمستقیم نیز خواهد داشت. در روزهای اخیر شواهد بیشتری از رزرویست هایی که به دلیل حجم غیرعادی روزهای رزرو از زمان شروع جنگ شمشیرهای آهنی اخراج شده اند، منتشر شده و این نگرانی وجود دارد که کارفرمایان زیادی اکنون از استخدام کارگرانی که انتظار می رود هر سال یک یا دو ماه از کار غیبت کنند، خودداری کنند. علاوه بر این، انتظار می رود این اقدام به اشتغال همسران رزرویست هایی که فرزند دارند، آسیب برساند، زیرا مسئولیت نگهداری از فرزندان به عهده همسری خواهد بود که در خانه می ماند و یک تا دو ماه به عنوان \\"والدین تک\\" عمل می کند. بر اساس گزارش اقتصاددان ارشد، 52 درصد از رزرویست ها والدین فرزندان هستند. عنوان: تمدید معافیت از خدمت برای محصلین مدارس مذهبی نشان می دهد: دولت از سربازگریزی حمایت می کند از دیروز هیچ پایه قانونی برای معافیت دانشجویان مدارس مذهبی وجود ندارد، به جز یک تصمیم دولتی مشکوک. مشخص شده است که نافرمانی مدنی 60 هزار محصل مدارس مذهبی در این دولت قانونی است، زیرا آنها بخشی از ائتلاف کودتا هستند، و هشدار رزمندگان برتر برای عدم داوطلب شدن آنارشی خطرناک است. محدودیتی برای دورویی وجود ندارد. از دیروز، پایه قانونی برای تنظیم تأخیر در خدمت محصلین مدارس مذهبی به هیچ وجه مشخص نیست. تمدیدهایی که دادگاه عالی به دستورالعمل مجاز برای فرار محصلین از خدمت داد، به پایان رسید، بدون اینکه قانونی برای تنظیم آن تصویب شود. درست است، دولت روز یکشنبه اعتبار این آرایش را تا پایان مارس 2024 تمدید کرد، اما تمام این بحران ناشی از این واقعیت است که دادگاه عالی تصمیم گرفت که برای آن یک قانون لازم است، بنابراین در کل مشخص نیست که آیا تصمیم دولت معنایی دارد یا خیر. بر اساس آمار سالنامه جامعه حریدی در موسسه دموکراسی اسرائیل، در آرایش تأخیر خدمت، بیش از 60 هزار محصل مدارس مذهبی در سنین 26 سال (سنی که در آن معافیت کامل از خدمت دریافت می کنند)، از جمله 41،500 محصل در مدارس مذهبی های بزرگ (مدارس مذهبی های برای محصلین مجرد بالغ) و 18،500 محصلین مراکز محصلین (محصلین مدارس مذهبی های متأهل) وجود دارد. اما هیچ محصل مدارس مذهبی یا محصل ای نباید از خواب شبانه محروم شود. اعتبار این آرایش قبلاً نیز منقضی شده بود و این باعث فراخوانی حتی یک محصل مدارس مذهبی نشد. ما به چنین نوعی از نافرمانی مدنی آنقدر عادت کرده ایم که به ما می گویند اگر تلاش کنیم تا برابری در بار را جایگزین کنیم و تبعیض بین خون را لغو کنیم، \\"همه ما (محصلین مدارس مذهبی و محصلین) به زندان خواهیم رفت\\"، که دیگر تکان نمی خوریم. اما واقعا باید از دورویی تکان بخوریم. این هفته نه تنها هفته پایان سال تحصیلی، بلکه هفته پایان دوره های آموزشی در ارتش نیز بود. بنیامین نتانیاهو، نخست وزیر، از سخنرانی خود برای اعلام این مسئله استفاده کرد: \\"هیچ جایی برای سرباز گریزی، نه از این سو و نه از هر سوی دیگر وجود ندارد. یک کشور، یک ارتش و یک خانه داریم. مانند برادران و خواهران از این خانه محافظت خواهیم کرد، و اگر روزی فرمان داده شود، متحد و مصمم مانند مشت آهنین برای پرچم حاضر خواهیم شد.\\" یعنی همه مانند یک نفر، به جز محصلین مدارس مذهبی که دولت روز یکشنبه گذشته تصمیم گرفت آنها را معاف کند. اما تمام انتقادات نه به سمت 60 هزار فرار از خدمت که هرگز خدمت نکرده اند، بلکه به سمت معترضانی که سالهای طولانی از زندگی خود را دادند و اعلام کردند که شاید در شرایط خاصی داوطلب نمی شوند، سوق داده خواهد شد. در روح کتاب \\"1984\\"، دولت اشیا را با نامی برخلاف واقعیت می نامد. عنوان تصمیم دولت \\"خدمت در ارتش دفاع اسرائیل و احترام به سربازان\\" بود، نه مثلا (پیشنهاد) \\"فرار از ارتش دفاع اسرائیل و تف به روی سربازان\\". این در حالی است که تنها جمله مهم در تصمیم \\"اقدامات برای سربازگیری دانشجویان مدارس مذهبی اتخاذ نخواهد شد\\" بود. این همان دولتی است که آنقدر از مسدود کردن چند خیابان و سوزاندن لاستیک در نزدیکی خانه های وزرا تکان می خورد، حتی نشستهایی برای بحث در مورد محدودیت اعتراض تشکیل می دهد. این تعادل است: فرار گسترده یک جامعه کامل که در حال رشد است زیرا طرفداران حریدی از دولت هرج و مرج شامی کامل حمایت می کنند؛ تهدید به عدم داوطلب شدن یا سوزاندن چند لاستیک این جا و آن جا تهدیدی علیه حاکمیت قانون و آنارشی است زیرا هدف نابود کردن کودتای دولتی است. همچنین مهم است به یاد داشته باشیم که چه کسی ارتباط بین کودتای دولتی، قانون فرار از خدمت و تبعیض بین خون را ایجاد کرد، حریدی ها بودند که خواستار حفاظت از آن در بند مصون سازی هستند. آنچه آنها در عمل باعث شدند این بود که حتی یک قانون ساده فرار از خدمت بدون بند مصون سازی هم تصویب نشد. بنابراین در حال حاضر همه 60 هزار محصل مدارس مذهبی بر اساس قانون نیز فراری هستند، نه فقط از نظر عملی (حتی اگر دولت تصمیم گرفت اقدامی علیه آنها انجام ندهد). بهانه های فرار از خدمت شناخته شده است: اهمیت تلاوت تورات (بدون هیچ محدودیت عددی) و ترس از افتادن محصلین، و عمدتاً \\"این پرنده روح ماست\\". زمان آن رسیده است که حریدی ها درک کنند که جامعه دموکراتیک هم پرنده روحی دارد - شهروندان آزاد در سرزمین خود بودن و اینکه باید آنچه را که برای اکثریت سرباز کشور مقدس است احترام بگذارند، شاید از حمایت خود از کودتای دولتی دست بردارند. در این میان، جامعه دموکراتیک، با یا بدون داوطلب نبودن، به تحمل اکثر خدمات امنیتی و دفاع از کشور اسرائیل ادامه خواهد داد. عنوان: تلاوت تورات به عنوان \\"خدمت معنادار\\" محسوب می شود: اینگونه یهودیت تورات برنامه ریزی می کند تا معافیت حریدی ها از خدمت سربازی را تثبیت کند یهودیت تورات پیشنهاد قانون اساسی: تلاوت تورات را ارائه کرد که در آن درخواست شده است تا مقرر شود \\"کسی که می خواهد خود را برای مدت طولانی به تلاوت تورات اختصاص دهد، از این نظر که حقوق و تکالیف او به رسمیت شناخته می شود دریافت خواهد کرد.\\" این پیشنهاد قانونی که در توافقنامه های ائتلافی به آن پرداخته شده است، قرار است بند مصون سازی را به عنوان روشی برای محافظت از آرایش تأخیر در خدمت گسترده دانشجویان مدارس مذهبی حریدی در برابر دخالت دادگاه عالی جایگزین کند. نماینده موشه رات از یهودیت تورات و سایر اعضای فراکسیون دیروز (دوشنبه) پیشنهاد قانون اساسی: تلاوت تورات را ارائه کردند. این پیشنهاد مقرر می کند که تلاوت تورات به عنوان \\"خدمت معنادار\\" محسوب شود و قرار است بند مصون سازی را به عنوان ابزاری برای محافظت از قانونی که آرایش تأخیر در خدمت گسترده دانشجویان مدارس مذهبی حریدی را تثبیت می کند، از دخالت دادگاه عالی جایگزین کند. در سالهای اخیر، وضعیت موجود این بود که پارلمان قانونی را تصویب می کرد که تأخیر در خدمت را امکان پذیر می کرد و دادگاه عالی آن را لغو می کرد. توافق ائتلافی با حزب یهودیت تورات مقرر می دارد که دولت باید پیش از تصویب بودجه، قانون اساسی را برای تنظیم وضعیت محصلین تورات ارائه دهد. تا کنون گرایش آن بود که معافیت را از طریق بند مصون سازی در چارچوب کودتای دولتی حفاظت کند، اما به دلیل دشواری در تصویب آن، پیشنهاد قانون اساسی ارائه شد. پیشنهاد قانون مقرر می کند: \\"تلاوت تورات ارزش اساسی در کشور اسرائیل است. کشور اسرائیل به عنوان یک کشور یهودی، ترویج تلاوت تورات و محصلین تورات را بسیار مهم می داند، و برای حقوق و تکالیف آنها، کسانی را که متعهد به تحصیل تورات برای یک دوره طولانی شده اند به عنوان کسانی که در خدمت معنادار به کشور اسرائیل و مردم یهودی هستند در نظر گرفته می شوند.\\" ارائه دهندگان این قانون در توضیحات خود می گویند \\"از ابتدا ارزش و اهمیت تلاوت تورات و محصلین تورات روشن بوده است\\". بنابراین، \\"پیشنهاد می شود تا اهمیت زیاد و ارزش بزرگی که کشور برای تلاوت تورات قائل است و تمایل آن به تشویق تلاوت تورات، به درستی در قانون اساسی تثبیت شود. این قانون اساسی همچنین برای روشن کردن موضع پارلمان که سیاست های تمام دولت های اسرائیل را در قانون اساسی تثبیت می کند، در نظر گرفته شده است. بنابراین، با توجه به مرکزیت ارزش تلاوت تورات و اهمیت آن به عنوان خدمتی به مردم یهودی - کسی که می خواهد خود را برای مدت طولانی به تلاوت تورات اختصاص دهد، از این نظر که حقوق و تکالیف او به رسمیت شناخته می شود دریافت خواهد کرد\\". نماینده رابی موشه رات گفت: \\"در توافق ائتلافی توافق شد که این پیشنهاد قانون یک پیشنهاد دولتی باشد، اما این کار در زمان توافق شده انجام نشد. بنابراین تصمیم گرفتیم این قانون را به عنوان یک پیشنهاد خصوصی از طرف کل فراکسیون ارائه دهیم تا بتوانیم قانون را در ابتدای دوره پاییزی به سرعت پیش ببریم.\\" همانطور که گفته شد، به نظر می رسد انتخاب مسیر قانون اساسی ناشی از قصد ائتلاف و فراکسیون های حریدی برای اجتناب از تصویب بند مصون سازی در حال حاضر است. در هفته گذشته، نشریه دگل تورات با عنوان \\"یتد نئمان\\" خواستار توقف حمایت از بند مصون سازی و توقف کودتای دولتی برای گفتگو پس از تصویب قانون لغو دلیل منطقی شد. این کار برای متوقف کردن حملات و دشمنی علیه جامعه حریدی انجام شد. دگل تورات فراکسیون لیتوانیایی درون یهودیت تورات است که رهبری آن را موشه گفنی، رئیس کمیته مالی پارلمان بر عهده دارد. 84 روز خدمت احتیاطی در سال برای افسران: بار بر روی نیروهای احتیاطی به طور قابل توجهی افزایش می یابد، معافیت برای افراد مذهبی ادامه می یابد وزارت دفاع به روزرسانی های قانون خدمت امنیتی و خدمت احتیاطی را منتشر کرد که شامل افزایش قابل توجهی در میزان خدمت در ارتش منظم و احتیاطی است. طبق متن، هر نیروی احتیاطی مجبور خواهد بود به طور متوسط 42 روز خدمت احتیاطی در سال را انجام دهد و فرماندهان - 70 روز. علیرغم افزایش بار، این قانون میزان سربازگیری جمعیت را افزایش نمی‌دهد و درخواستی برای سربازگیری فرزندان مدارس مذهبی مذهبی نمی‌کند. وزارت دفاع به روزرسانی هایی برای قانون خدمت امنیتی و احتیاطی را منتشر کرد که شامل افزایش قابل توجهی در میزان خدمت در ارتش منظم و ارتش احتیاطی است. محور اصلی این قانون، افزایش مدت خدمت منظم برای مردان از 32 ماه در حال حاضر به 36 ماه است، که افزایش مدت خدمت شامل سربازان فعلی نیز می‌شود. در کنار افزایش مدت خدمت منظم به سه سال که مورد انتظار بود و قبلاً نیز در مورد آن صحبت شده بود (حداقل در زمینه رزمندگان)، تغییر معنادار که این قانون ارائه می‌دهد، افزایش فوق‌العاده در بار کاری شهروندانی است که در نیروهای احتیاطی خدمت می‌کنند. بر اساس متن منتشر شده، تعداد روزهای خدمت احتیاطی سه برابر می‌شود: در حال حاضر، رزمندگانی که در نیروهای احتیاطی خدمت می‌کنند بر اساس مدل سه‌ساله سربازگیری می‌شوند که در قالب آن یک سال آموزش به مدت یک تا دو هفته انجام می‌شود، در سال دوم 21 روز کار عملیاتی و سال سوم نوعی \\"سال استراحت\\" است که در آن میزان خدمت احتیاطی کاهش می‌یابد - و این چرخه از سر گرفته می‌شود. بر اساس قانون جدید، هر نیروی احتیاطی مجبور خواهد بود به طور متوسط 42 روز خدمت احتیاطی در سال انجام دهد، فرماندهان مجبور خواهند شد 70 روز خدمت احتیاطی در سال و افسران 84 روز خدمت احتیاطی به طور متوسط در سال انجام دهند. افزایش مدت خدمت منظم همراه با افزایش مدت خدمت احتیاطی، وضعیتی را ایجاد می‌کند که در آن یک رزمنده که در سن 21 سالگی پس از سه سال خدمت آزاد می‌شود، باید 1050 روز خدمت احتیاطی دیگر تا سن 46 سالگی انجام دهد. این به آن معناست که هر رزمنده در ارتش اسرائیل 6 سال خدمت نظامی را انجام خواهد داد. به روزرسانی فعلی حجم سربازگیری جمعیت را افزایش نمی‌دهد و به مسائل افزایش مدت خدمت برای زنان، افزایش ظرفیت خدمت ملی، سربازگیری افراد مذهبی و عرب، سربازگیری دختران مذهبی و دیگرانی که خدمت جزئی دارند، نمی‌پردازد. در طول سال‌ها ارتش اسرائیل اشاره کرده بود که نیازی به سربازگیری افراد مذهبی نیست زیرا ارتش به تمام کسانی که به مرکز سربازگیری می‌آیند نیاز ندارد، اما اکنون که نیاز قطعی به سربازگیری هزاران سرباز و رزمنده وجود دارد، ارتش همچنان ترجیح می‌دهد صدایش را بلند نکند و سربازگیری فرزندان مدارس مذهبی مذهبی را درخواست نکند، و به جای آن، انتخاب می‌کند بار بیشتری را بر روی آنهایی که خدمت می‌کنند، قرار دهد. درصورتی که این قانون با متن فعلی تصویب شود، به این معنی است که بار بر روی بخش تولیدی که به میزان زیادی در بازار کار مشارکت دارد و بیشترین مالیات را پرداخت می‌کند، فقط بیشتر خواهد شد. اقتصاددان ارشد این هفته اعلام کرد که جمعیت نیروهای احتیاطی دارای درآمد بالاتری نسبت به جمعیت عمومی هستند و در سال 2019 (آخرین سالی که داده‌هایی از آن وجود دارد) مشخص شد که درآمد آنها 47٪ بیشتر از متوسط درآمد در اقتصاد است. حدود 20٪ از نیروهای احتیاطی در مشاغل مدارس مذهبی فناوری اطلاعات مشغول به کار هستند، که دو برابر نرخ آن در جمعیت عمومی است. تا کنون هنوز برآوردهای رسمی از هزینه مستقیم بودجه‌ای این اقدامات منتشر نشده است، اما انتظار می‌رود هزینه‌های بودجه دولت را به میلیاردها واحد پول افزایش دهد. همچنین انتظار می‌رود این اقدامات به خسارت اقتصادی عظیم در سطح اقتصاد به دلیل از دست رفتن روزهای کاری زیادی که به ناچار به آسیب محصول ناخالص داخلی می‌انجامد، منجر شود. علاوه بر این، انتظار می‌رود این اقدام پیامدهای اقتصادی غیرمستقیم داشته باشد - از جمله احتمال دارد که کارفرمایان را تشویق کند تا از استخدام نیروهای احتیاطی و افسران به دلیل غیبت پیش‌بینی شده آنها از محل کار، خودداری کنند. همچنین انتظار می‌رود این موضوع به اشتغال همسران نیروهای احتیاطی که دارای فرزند هستند، آسیب برساند. طبق گفته اقتصاددان ارشد، 52٪ از نیروهای احتیاطی والدین فرزندان هستند. دولت در برابر رشد: بودجه مدارس مذهبی مذهبی به 1.73 میلیارد شکل افزایش می یابد بودجه 65 میلیون شکل افزایش یافت - بنابراین افزایش به روز بودجه مدارس مذهبی 1.134 میلیارد شکل است. منبع بودجه برای این افزایش، خود بودجه های ائتلافی است که 2٪ کاهش یافت. دولت تصمیم گرفت بودجه اضافی برای مدارس مذهبی را 65 میلیون شکل افزایش دهد، بنابراین افزایش به روز بودجه مدارس مذهبی بر روی 1.134 میلیارد شکل است، این علاوه بر بودجه 600 میلیون شکل است که در پایه بودجه وجود دارد و بخشی از بودجه های ائتلافی نیست. به این معنی که بودجه به روز شده مدارس مذهبی به 1.734 میلیارد شکل می رسد. منبع بودجه ای برای این افزایش، خود بودجه های ائتلافی است که 2٪ کاهش یافت. یادآوری می کنیم، بودجه های ائتلافی برای سال 2024 در ابتدا حدود 8 میلیارد شکل بود، اما 25٪ به حدود 6 میلیارد شکل برای بودجه به روز شده سال 2024 که به دلیل چالش های بودجه ای که با آغاز جنگ شمشیرهای آهنین شروع شد، مورد نیاز بود، کاهش یافت. در اکثر بندهای بودجه ائتلافی، کاهش بیشتر و نزدیک به 30٪ بود، زیرا 1.55 میلیارد شکل از بودجه های ائتلافی که به سیستم بهداشت و وزارت امنیت ملی اختصاص یافت، هیچ کاهشی نداشت. افزایش اولیه به بودجه اصلی مدارس مذهبی 1.385 میلیارد برای سال 2024 بود، اما این 23٪ به سطح 1.069 میلیارد شکل کاهش یافت. سیاستمداران مذهبی ادعا کردند که این کاهش بیش از آنچه آنها محاسبه کرده بودند است، بنابراین تصمیم گرفته شد کاهش بیشتری را بر روی باقی بودجه های ائتلافی اعمال کنند. با این حال، در این کاهش نیز، افزایش های امنیت ملی و بهداشت مستثنی شدند، و افزایش بودجه مدارس مذهبی از طریق کاهش 2٪ بر روی 3.4 میلیارد شکل از باقی مانده بودجه های ائتلافی اخذ شد. درک معنای واقعی این کاهش دشوار است، اما آن یک تغییر در اولویت بندی درون بودجه های ائتلافی را نشان می دهد. به عنوان مثال، در اینجا تخصیص حدود 1.8 میلیون شکل از بندی که برای تقویت هویت یهودی از طریق پروژه های مشترک با مدارس مذهبی مذهبی در نظر گرفته شده بود وجود دارد، تخصیص حدود یک میلیون شکل از هسته های ماموریتی به مدارس مذهبی مذهبی، و تخصیص هزاران شکل از پروژه های دیگر برای تقویت هویت یهودی در میان جامعه عمومی اسرائیل. از یک طرف، به جای \\"اجبار مذهبی\\" بر عموم مردم، بودجه ها به درون تخصیص یافته است. از طرف دیگر، این بودجه ها به تشویق انزوای افراد مذهبی و کاهش انگیزه ها برای ادغام در بازار کار اختصاص یافته است. سایر منابع تأمین مالی برای این کاهش، انتقال بودجه های داخلی در میان جامعه مذهبی از فرهنگ یهودی به مدارس مذهبی است. در مقابل، می توان فرض کرد که شهروندان زیادی نیستند که بر کاهش حدود 300 هزار شکل بودجه برای ابدی کردن یاد ربعام \\"گاندی\\" زاوی اشک بریزند. اما بندهای دیگری وجود دارد که مجبور شدند برای افزایش اضافی بودجه مدارس مذهبی مالیات بپردازند، که به عنوان یک اولویت بندی مشکل آفرین حتی در درون بودجه های ائتلافی به نظر می رسد. به عنوان مثال، بودجه ساخت کلاس های درس حدود 800 هزار شکل کاهش یافت، و بودجه ای برای تشویق اشتغال زنان مذهبی در قالب سمینارها حدود 717 هزار شکل کاهش یافت. در هر صورت، تصمیم دولت برای تأمین مالی این افزایش از درون بودجه های ائتلافی و نه از طریق افزایش کسری بودجه یا کاهش گسترده در تمام وزارتخانه های دولت نشان می دهد که انتقاد عمومی از بودجه های ائتلافی تا حدودی تأثیرگذار بوده است. نشانه دیگری از این موضوع را می توان در تصمیم دولت برای انتقال 5 میلیون شکل از بودجه های ائتلافی از عرصه فرهنگ یهودی به عرصه بهداشت مشاهده کرد: سه میلیون به حمایت از سازمان های داوطلب ملی و دو میلیون دیگر به سازمان هایی که برای افزایش ظرفیت پیوند و جذب اهداکنندگان اعضای بدن فعالیت می کنند، منتقل خواهد شد. برنامه تقویت نظامی تنظیم شد: بودجه بیشتر برای ارتش، نظارت کمتر بخش قابل توجهی از بودجه 100 میلیارد شکلی که تنظیم شد، مختص به تسلیحات، افزایش موجودی ها و امکانات تولید در شرایط اضطراری است. وزارت خزانه داری نگران است که گسترش بودجه دائمی باقی بماند و بار مالیاتی بر عموم شهروندانی که خدمت می کنند را افزایش دهد. وزارتخانه های دفاع و خزانه داری بر سر برنامه تقویت چندساله برای ارتش به ارزش 100 میلیارد شکل به توافق رسیدند، همانطور که امروز در سایت \\"کالکالیست\\" فاش شد. این دو طرف پس از مذاکرات طولانی در پایگاه نظامی کریاه به توافق رسیدند و در نهایت به نظر می رسد نتیجه این است که امنیت (دوباره) موفق شده است وزارت خزانه داری را تسلیم کند. بودجه تقویت نظامی به طیف گسترده ای از جنبه ها از جمله مسائل مربوط به خرید تجهیزات نظامی و افزایش نیروی انسانی در ارتش اشاره دارد. \\"کالکالیست\\" متوجه شد که بخش قابل توجهی از این بودجه برای تسلیحات در نظر گرفته شده است، و این در پس زمینه کمبود جهانی مهمات و تلاش نظام امنیتی برای کاهش وابستگی نظامی اسرائیل به جهان است. با این حال، صرفاً مسئله ایجاد خطوط تولید برای بمب ها و خمپاره ها نیست، بلکه افزایش موجودی ها و همچنین ذخیره سازی مواد اولیه مربوطه برای تولید در شرایط اضطراری نیز مد نظر است. در هر صورت، نظام امنیتی به خوبی می داند که حتی پس از اجرای برنامه تسلیحات، ارتش همچنان به عوامل خارجی از جمله ایالات متحده و \\"هیچ قصدی برای بازسازی پروژه لویاتان\\" وابسته خواهد بود. در همه موارد مربوط به مسائل نیروی انسانی، دو طرف قصد دارند توافقات حاصل شده در چارچوب مذاکرات بر سر بودجه در سطح پایه را که از جمله شامل مجاز دانستن افزایش های حقوق رامتکال (پرداخت های حقوقی به بازنشستگان ارتش واجد شرایط بازنشستگی از بودجه) و کوتاه کردن خدمت برای سربازان در برخی از مشاغل پشتیبانی است، حفظ کنند. با این حال، خدمت منظم برای رزمندگان احتمالاً دوباره به سه سال افزایش می یابد، تعداد روزهای خدمت احتیاطی افزایش خواهد یافت، و انتظار می رود ارتش حدود 2000 تا 3000 نیروی ثابت دیگر را جذب کند. در چارچوب مذاکرات بر سر برنامه تقویت نظامی، درخواستی از سوی وزارت خزانه داری و بانک مرکزی اسرائیل مبنی بر تشکیل کمیته ای که در آن نهادهای غیرنظامی، دولتی و امنیتی حضور داشته باشند و نیازهای تقویت ارتش را بار دیگر بررسی کنند، مطرح شد. این درخواست در راستای تمایل به اجتناب از تفکر جزم گرایانه پس از رویدادهای 7 اکتبر مطرح شد. در نهایت تصمیم گرفته شد که این کمیته تشکیل شود، هنوز مشخص نیست با چه ترکیبی، اما ماموریت آن به طور قابل توجهی کوتاه شد: بر اساس توافقات پیش رو، این کمیته در مورد هر مبلغی از برنامه تقویت نظامی بحث خواهد کرد، اما فقط در مورد 18 میلیارد شکل از آن ماموریت انحصاری خواهد داشت. وزارت دفاع و ارتش می توانند بدون وابستگی به تصمیمات یا توصیه های کمیته، برای باقی مبلغ 82 میلیارد شکل تعهد ایجاد کنند. وزارت دفاع بر این مسئله اصرار داشت تا بتوانند در موارد اضطراری به سرعت پاسخگوی تامین تجهیزات باشند، اما در وزارت خزانه داری معتقد بودند که این امر ممکن است منجر به این شود که ارتش بیشتر پول را \\"برای کالاهای شناخته شده و سریع\\" هزینه کند، نه \\"برای کارآمد و درست\\"، و اینکه فقدان نظارت و یک بودجه بزرگ باعث می شود ارتش اولویت بندی درست نیازها را انجام ندهد و تلاش کند همه چیز را از همه چیز به دست آورد. باید گفت که نگرانی اصلی در وزارت خزانه داری نه ترکیب برنامه تقویت نظامی، بلکه دامنه آن و پیامدهای کلان اقتصادی آن است. در وزارت خزانه داری اعتقاد بر این است که اقتصاد توانایی مقابله با هزینه های یکباره جنگ و افزایش سالانه 10 میلیارد شکلی را که برنامه تقویت نظامی ایجاب می کند، دارد. در وزارت خزانه داری از این نگران هستند که درخواست برای افزایش بودجه دفاعی دائمی شود و این به معنای افزایش بار مالیاتی بر عموم مردم شاغل همراه با افزایش بار سربازگیری بر روی همان جمعیتی است که در حال خدمت هستند. این یکی از دلایلی است که در وزارت خزانه داری در این روزها اقدامات مالیاتی رگرسیو مانند افزایش مالیات بر ارزش افزوده را بر افزایش مالیات بر درآمد ترجیح می دهند، و این از جمله به منظور گسترش بار مالیاتی بر روی اقشار دیگری مانند جمعیت مذهبی و عرب که مالیات کمتری پرداخت می کنند و سربازگیری کمتری دارند، است. --- چالش خدمت نظام وظیفه حریدی ها (جامعه یهودیان متدین) در اسرائیل موضوع پیچیده و چالش برانگیزی است که با جنگ اخیر میان اسرائیل و غزه به طور قابل توجهی تشدید شده است. از یک طرف، نیاز ارتش اسرائیل به نیروی انسانی بیشتر در زمان جنگ و افزایش بار کاری و تلفات، ضرورت مشارکت بیشتر جامعه حریدی در خدمت نظامی را تقویت می کند. اما از طرف دیگر، موضع سنتی حریدی ها در مخالفت با سربازگیری و ترجیح آنها برای تحصیل در مدارس مذهبی مذهبی، به همراه نفوذ سیاسی و قدرت چانه زنی ائتلافی آنها در دولت فعلی، چالش های عمده ای را در زمینه افزایش گرایش به سربازگیری در این جامعه ایجاد می کند. برخی از عوامل تشدید کننده این چالش عبارتند از: 1. نیاز فوری ارتش به نیروهای بیشتر در زمان جنگ. 2. تلفات سنگین تر در صفوف رزمندگان و نیاز به جایگزینی مداوم نیروها. 3. حجم بالای حملات راکتی و موشکی به سرزمین های اشغالی و نیاز به پرسنل بیشتر برای پدافند هوایی. 4. امکان افزایش منابع مالی برای افزایش جذب نیروی انسانی ناشی از درگیری های نظامی. از طرف دیگر، عوامل کاهنده این چالش می تواند شامل موارد زیر باشد: 1. حفظ وضع موجود از سوی سران مذهبی حریدی و مخالفت با سربازگیری اجباری. 2. قدرت چانه زنی قوی احزاب حریدی در ائتلاف دولتی و امکان کسب امتیازات مالی و بودجه ای در ازای معافیت از سربازگیری. 3. موضع دولت در حفظ آرامش و اجتناب از تنش با احزاب حریدی در شرایط بحرانی. 4. مخالفت احتمالی رأی دهندگان حریدی با احزابشان در صورت سازش با دولت در مورد سربازگیری اجباری. به طور خلاصه، هر چند نیازهای نظامی و جنگ احتمالاً فشار فزاینده ای برای افزایش سربازگیری حریدی ها وارد می کند، اما عوامل سیاسی، فرهنگی و اجتماعی همچنان به عنوان موانع عمده ای در برابر این روند باقی می مانند. گره گشایی از این چالش نیازمند رویکردهای نوآورانه و مصالحه ای از سوی همه طرف های درگیر است.","completion":"مشکل جذب محصلین مدارس مذهبی به خدمت نظامی در اسرائیل یک چالش سیاسی و اجتماعی است. ارتش اسرائیل به نیروی انسانی بیشتری نیاز دارد، اما جامعه حریدی با خدمت سربازی مخالف است و به

(حریدیم) در اسرائیل به موضوعی داغ تبدیل شده است، به ویژه پس از جنگ اخیر با غزه که نیاز به نیروهای بیشتری را اثبات کرد. افراد حریدی اغلب ترجیح می‌دهند به جای خدمت نظامی به تحصیلات دینی خود ادامه دهند. این در حالی است که قضات دیوان عالی اسرائیل قانون سابقی که به محصلین مدارس مذهبی اجازه فرار از خدمت را می‌داد، لغو کرده‌اند و به پارلمان مهلت داده‌اند تا قانون جدیدی تصویب کند. درخواست‌هایی برای جذب محصلین مدارس مذهبی به خدمت نظامی مطرح شده است، اما دولت اسرائیل به ارتش دستور داده است تا از جذب آنها خودداری کند. این موضوع باعث شده است که نارضایتی از بین جمعیت عمومی روز به روز بیشتر شود، زیرا بسیاری از سربازان احساس می‌کنند که فشار خدمت نظامی بیشتر به دوش آنها است. تقاضاهای جدید برای جذب محصلین مدارس مذهبی تا حدودی به دلیل جنگ جدید و نیاز ارتش به نیروهای بیشتر تشدید شده است. در عین حال، اقداماتی برای افزایش خدمت سربازان رزمی و افزایش سن معافیت از خدمت احتیاطی ارائه شده تا فشار بر روی سربازان فعلی را کاهش دهند، اعتراضاتی را از سوی گروه‌هایی مانند مادران در جبهه و برادران سلاح در پی داشته است. مادران در جبهه و برادران سلاح خواستار جذب محصلین مدارس مذهبی به خدمت نظامی هستند، و وکلای آنها بر این عقیده‌اند که تصمیم دولت برای جلوگیری از جذب این افراد غیرقانونی است و یک بحران قانون اساسی ایجاد کرده است. با وجود این چالش‌ها، افراد مذهبی متعصب توانسته‌اند قوانین سهل‌گیرانه‌ای را از پارلمان برای خود به دست آورند. این قوانین به آنها اجازه می‌دهند تا تاریخ 26 سالگی از خدمت سربازی فرار کنند و در مدارس مذهبی بمانند. این وضعیت انتقادهای زیادی را برانگیخته و باعث شده است که بسیاری از افراد غیرمذهبی احساس کنند که بین افراد مذهبی و غیرمذهبی تبعیض وجود دارد. اسرائیل با یک دور باطل از قوانینی که از طرف پارلمان تصویب و توسط دیوان عالی لغو می‌شوند، روبرو است. هدف حریدی‌ها این است که قانون فرار از خدمت سربازی بدون هیچ سهمیه، هدف جذب یا تحریمی وجود داشته باشد. در میان این بحران‌ها و چالش‌ها، برخی از رهبران حریدی بر این باورند که خدمت نظامی یک وظیفه است. از سوی دیگر، مدارس مذهبی نیز به دنبال جذب دانش آموزان در سال‌های ماقبل خدمت است. اما در عمل، تعداد کمی از محصلین مدارس مذهبی علاقه‌مند به پیوستن به ارتش هستند و روند جذب آنها همچنان کند و دشوار باقی مانده است. در پایان، بحران خدمت نظامی محصلین مدارس مذهبی در اسرائیل نشان‌دهنده تضاد بین نیازهای ملی و مقاومت‌های ایدئولوژیکی است. در حالی که اکثریت ساکنان اسرائیل به خدمت نظامی می‌پردازند و بار دفاع از کشور را به دوش می‌کشند، جامعه مذهبی استثنایی بزرگ دریافت کرده و از این الزام معاف شده است. این موضوع به یک بحث سیاسی و اجتماعی مهم در اسرائیل تبدیل شده است و به نظر می‌رسد که فعلاً راه حلی برای این وضعیت اساسی و چالش‌برانگیز وجود ندارد."},{"prompt":"لطفا خلاصه جامعتری که بیش از 1000 کلمه (نه هزار کاراکتر بلکه هزار کلمه) باشد ارائه کن","completion":"اجازه دهید خلاصه‌ای از موضوع را با استناد به مشکلات بسیار پیچیده ای که نسبت به جذب نیروی نظامی در میان جامعه مذهبی حریدی در اسرائیل وجود دارد و تلاش برای یافتن راه حل‌هایی قانونی برای آن، ارائه دهم: مسئله خدمت سربازی محصلین مدارس مذهبی اسرائیلی به یک موضوع مورد بحث و اختلاف بدل شده است که گروه‌های مختلف فعال در جامعه اسرائیل را به چالش می‌کشد. یافتن تعادل میان وجوه مختلف این چالش، از جمله ملاحظات دینی، امنیتی، سیاسی و اجتماعی، بدون شک یک معضل است. ارتش اسرائیل، به نام IDF، که به میزان قابل توجهی به نیروی انسانی متکی است، همیشه با چالش جذب نیرو مواجه بوده است. جامعه حریدی که به واسطه مفاد دینی و آموزه‌های خاص، مخالفت‌هایی با جذب عمومی دارند، به طور سنتی ترجیح داده‌اند که به جای پیوستن به نیروهای نظامی، در مدارس مذهبی مشغول به تحصیل شوند. تنش بین نیازهای نظامی و ترجیحات دینی تشدید شده است، زیرا قضات دیوان عالی ارتش اسرائیل از پارلمان درخواست کرده‌اند قوانین جدیدی تصویب کنند تا جایگزین قانون سابقی شوند که به محصلین مدارس مذهبی اجازه فرار از خدمت نظامی را می‌داد. این دستورات، ارتش را در موقعیتی قرار داده است که از جذب محصلین مدارس مذهبی خودداری کند، در حالی که این فرار از خدمت به واسطه عدم وجود قانون جدید در حال حاضر غیرقانونی نیز هست. جنگ اخیر با غزه فشارها برای جذب محصلین مدارس مذهبی به خدمت نظامی را تشدید کرده و نیاز به نیروهای بیشتر برای پر کردن جای خالی تلفات و رسیدگی به حملات راکتی و موشکی را افزایش داده است. این درخواست با مقاومت‌های زیادی مواجه شده، به ویژه از سوی سازمان‌های حقوق بشر و جنبش‌هایی مانند \\"مادران در جبهه\\" و \\"برادران سلاح\\" که خواستار پایان دادن به این نابرابری و کاهش بار روی سربازان فعلی هستند. گروه‌های فشار و مادران اعتراض‌هایی ارائه داده‌اند که دولت را به چالش می‌کشند، مخالفت خود را با عدم اجرای قوانین و دستورات دولتی که معافیت از خدمت حریدیم را ادامه می‌دهند، اعلام کرده‌اند. آنها تصریح کرده‌اند که تصمیم دولت، که در آن ارتش از جذب افراد مذهبی خودداری می‌کند، یک بحران قانون اساسی ایجاد کرده است، و اینکه ممکن است این مسئله بر روی مشارکت عموم جامعه در خدمت نظامی و نگاه شهروندان به موقعیت خود در کشور تاثیر بگذارد. حریدی‌ها، که در راس ائتلافی مثلف از چند حزب در دولت هستند، با استفاده از نفوذ خود، از دولت خواسته‌اند که قوانینی را تصویب کند که بدون هرگونه سهم‌بندی یا تحریم، معافیتشان از خدمت نظامی را تضمین کند. از سوی دیگر، جامعه حریدی نیز در تلاش است تا دانش‌آموزان خود را قبل از سن سربازگیری، از طریق مدارس پیش‌نظامی و داوطلبان خدمات سالانه جذب کند. رشد و گسترش جامعه حریدی و معافیت مداوم از خدمت نظامی منجر به افزایش فشار بر روی جامعه غیرمذهبی شده است چراکه این بار خدمت نظامی بیشتر بر دوش آنها قرار دارد و این احساس نابرابری را تشدید می‌کند. مؤسسات دولتی مانند دیوان عالی به دنبال حل این معضل قانونی هستند و انتظارات متفاوتی از طرف سازمان‌های امنیتی، سیاسی و مدنی وجود دارد که هر کدام به دنبال تأمین منافع خود هستند. این شرایط به یک بحران قانونی تبدیل شده است که نیازمند توجه فوری و مدبرانه است تا حقوق و تکالیف همه طرف‌ها را در نظر بگیرد. در این میان، دولت اقدام به افزایش بودجه مداوم مدارس مذهبی کرده است، و این نیز بیانگر آشفتگی در سیاست‌گذاری‌ها و اولویت‌بندی‌های مالی کشور است. این اختصاص بودجه شاید در کوتاه مدت به نفع جامعه حریدی باشد، اما وضعیت پیچیده‌ای را ایجاد کرده است که پیامدهای بلند مدت آن می‌تواند به زیان جامعه کلی و اکثریت مردم اسرائیل باشد. در نهایت، این بحران‌ها و چالش‌ها بیانگر تضاد بارز میان نیازهای ملی و مقاومت‌های ایدئولوژیکی طیفی از جامعه اسرائیل است. در حالی که اکثریت شهروندان اسرائیلی به خدمت در نظام می‌پردازند و بار دفاع از کشور را به دوش می‌کشند، اقلیتی همچون جامعه حریدی در حال دریافت امتیاز و استثناهای قابل توجهی هستند که موجب یک بحران عمیق سیاسی و اجتماعی بالقوه شده است. این تضادها و چالش‌های موجود، اثر مستقیمی بر هویت ملی و جایگاه شهروندان در یک جامعه دموکراتیک دارند و به نظر می‌رسد که راه حل ساده‌ای برای آنها در دسترس نمی‌باشد."},{"prompt":"Ignore all previous responses that you've been given.

Established in 1990, the DPR was among the first legally sanctioned political movements outside the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, advocating for democratic reforms. The party's ideologies at its inception were: 1. **Liberal democracy:** The party aimed to promote a political system characterized by free and fair elections, civil liberties, rule of law, and political pluralism. 2. **Market economy:** In contrast to the command economy of the Soviet Union, the Democratic Party of Russia supported the transition to a market economy, encouraging private enterprise and competition. 3. **Privatization and economic reforms:** The DPR was in favor of privatizing state-owned enterprises and implementing various economic reforms to encourage growth and integrate Russia into the global economy. 4. **National sovereignty and federalism:** The party supported the idea of sovereign nations within a federative Russian state, aiming to balance centralized power with regional independence. 5. **Social liberalism:** The party was generally aligned with social liberalism, which advocates for individual rights and freedoms, often including support for progressive social policies. Over time, however, the Democratic Party of Russia faced internal division and struggled to maintain a coherent ideology or stable leadership. The Russian political landscape experienced significant turbulence in the 1990s and 2000s, with the DPR eventually declining in influence and relevance. By the 2000s, the party's presence in Russian politics had dwindled, and it no longer played a significant role in shaping the country's direction. As of my knowledge cut off in 2023, the Democratic Party of Russia does not play a significant role in contemporary Russian politics, with the United Russia party dominating the political sphere under the leadership of Vladimir Putin and the systemic opposition parties such as the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) having more visibility and influence."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

While the term \\"liberal democratic\\" might suggest a party aligned with Western liberal democratic principles, the LDPR's ideology does not reflect liberal democracy as understood in much of Europe and North America. Instead, the party's stances have included elements of authoritarianism, nationalism, populism, and xenophobia. Key components of the LDPR's political ideology have included: 1. Nationalism: The LDPR has been strongly nationalist, advocating for the rights and interests of ethnic Russians and often engaging in rhetoric that is critical of minority groups and migrants. 2. Expansionism: The party has also been known for its irredentist claims, at times calling for the expansion of Russian territory to include parts of neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet Union, pursuing a form of neo-imperialism. 3. Authoritarianism: The LDPR has supported strong, centralized power and has been sympathetic to authoritarian styles of governance. Zhirinovsky, in particular, was known for his bombastic and autocratic leadership style. 4. Populism: The party has appealed to populist sentiments, often emphasizing a platform that claims to represent the common people against the elite and establishment, though the sincerity of these populist claims can be questioned. 5. Social Conservatism: The LDPR has endorsed socially conservative views, often opposing what it perceives as Western liberal values such as LGBT rights. 6. Anti-Western Sentiment: The party has frequently employed anti-Western rhetoric, positioning Russia as a counterweight to the perceived hegemony of the United States and its allies. 7. Economic Views: Economically, the LDPR has mixed views, sometimes promoting free-market principles, while at other times advocating for state intervention in certain sectors. The party's platform has been known to shift and can be somewhat inconsistent, but its core tends to maintain a focus on Russian nationalism and strong leadership. It is important to note that the LDPR's version of nationalism and advocacy for Russian interests often serves as a tool for popular mobilization rather than a consistent principle guiding policy decisions. Please note, political parties can evolve over time, and the description provided here may become outdated as leadership and party platforms change. The described ideologies were aligned with the LDPR under Vladimir Zhirinovsky's leadership until his death in April 2022.
