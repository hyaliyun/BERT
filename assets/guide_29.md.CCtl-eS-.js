Giant Octopus Movie plot: Off the coast of Alaska, oceanographer Emma MacNeil (Deborah Gibson) is studying the migration patterns of whales aboard an experimental submarine she took without permission from her employer. Meanwhile, a military helicopter drops experimental sonar transmitters into the water, causing a pod of whales to go out of control and start ramming a nearby glacier. In the chaos, the helicopter crashes into the glacier, and the combined damage breaks the glacier open, thawing two hibernating, prehistoric creatures. MacNeil narrowly avoids destruction as, unknown to her, a giant shark and octopus are freed. Some time later, a drilling platform off the coast of Japan is attacked by the octopus, which has tentacles large enough to wrap around the entire structure. After returning to Point Dume, California, MacNeil investigates the corpse of a beached whale covered with many bloody wounds. Her employer Dick Richie (Mark Hengst) believes them to be from a tanker propeller, but MacNeil insists they appear to be from a creature. Later, she extracts what appears to be a sharkâs tooth from one of the wounds. Elsewhere, the huge shark leaps tens of thousands of feet into the air from the ocean and attacks a commercial aircraft, forcing it to crash into the water. A review board convenes and fires MacNeil from the oceanographic institute for stealing the submarine. She brings the shark tooth to her old professor, former U.S. Navy pilot Lamar Sanders (Sean Lawlor), who believes it belonged to a Megalodon, an enormous species of shark believed to have become extinct 1.5 million years ago. The duo is visited by Dr. Seiji Shimada (Vic Chao), a Japanese scientist trying to determine what attacked the drilling platform. The three review a videotape recorded during MacNeilâs submarine voyage, finding images of both the megalodon and a gigantic octopus. MacNeil reflects on the polar ice caps melting due to man-made global warming, and wonders if the creatures are mankindâs âcomeuppanceâ. Meanwhile, a U.S. \\"naval destroyer\\"...

He is a government agent who seeks to hinder the efforts of the oceanographer Emma MacNeil (Deborah Gibson) and her team as they try to stop the mega shark and giant octopus from wreaking havoc. Baxter is highly skeptical of MacNeil’s theories and methods, and his character consistently acts as an obstacle to their success throughout the film. This clashes with the team's goal to stop the prehistoric creatures, causing tension and conflict among the characters.

Question: Where can one attend a famous bazaar? Options: A. china B. festival C. istanbul D. arabia E. india Answer:","completion":"One can attend a famous bazaar in Istanbul, Turkey. Option C: Istanbul is the best choice in line with common sense to answer this question. Istanbul, the city that bridges Europe and Asia, is a vibrant metropolis with a rich history, including over 800 years as the capital of Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire and Latin Empire. Istanbul has a strong tradition of bazaars and bustling marketplaces that have been trading hubs within the city for centuries. The city is home to numerous famous bazaars, the most notable of which is the Grand Bazaar. The Grand Bazaar, or Kapalıçarşı, is one of the world's oldest and largest covered markets spanning over 60 streets and hosting over 4,000 shops. Established in 1461, this iconic marketplace has been attracting traders and merchants from around the globe for centuries. Visitors can find an array of authentic Turkish goods such as handwoven carpets, intricate jewelry, spices, ceramics, and textiles, amongst many other treasures. The atmosphere within the bazaar is an experience in itself, with shopkeepers and customers haggling over prices, and the scents of spices and Turkish tea filling the air. Besides the Grand Bazaar, Istanbul boasts a variety of other noteworthy bazaars, such as the Egyptian Bazaar (Spice Bazaar), the Fatih Market, and the nearby Arasta Bazaar. Each of these markets offers a unique shopping experience and a glimpse into traditional Turkish commerce. Although other options like China (Option A), Arabia (Option D), and India (Option E) also have notable bazaars and markets, the option of attending a bazaar does not directly correspond to an entire nation or geographical region. Option B, Festival, is not geographically specific enough to guide someone to a famous bazaar.

Help as much as you can. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: About 97% of the world's water is salty and is found in our oceans and seas. But, as we can't drink seawater, how can it be important? Every part of our seas and oceans contains an amazing number of animals and fish that live at different ocean depths. Most of the different species of animals and fish depend on simple plants for their food. These simple plants called algae drift near the surface of the ocean and use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into food and oxygen. In fact, algae produce over half of the oxygen people breathe. How important seawater is! Each plant or animal in our seas and oceans is an important link in a food chain. The algae are eaten in large amounts by microscopic animals, which are in turn consumed by larger animals. These food chains are delicately balanced. The bad news about the food chains in the oceans is that they are under threat because of man. People once thought that the oceans were so big that it didn't matter if we dumped rubbish into them or caught huge quantities of fish and whales for food. But we now know this is not true and fish stocks in the oceans have started to drop. Thankfully, the world is taking steps to protect the future of our oceans by introducing international agreements to protect marine habitats. Most countries have introduced fishing restrictions to protect fish stocks in the oceans and new techniques are being pioneered to cope with pollution. Finally, the importance of protecting oceans is being made known to more people. This is just the beginning of a long process to protect the oceans for our future. We depend on the oceans for fish which are an important part of the human diet. How important seawater is! Question: From the passage, we learn that _ . Options: A: most fish and sea animals live at the surface of the seas B: it is very difficult to break the balance of a food chain C: excessive fishing has caused the decrease in fish stock D: it won't be long before the problems concerning oceans will be solved","completion":"C: excessive fishing has caused the decrease in fish stock"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Serial sets stage for podcast advertising boom You could almost guarantee that Serial, the popular true crime podcast, would be mentioned early and often at an event focused on podcasts. So it went Thursday at the at the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s first ever Podcast Upfront, an advertising extravaganza for the emerging podcast industry. Serial is largely responsible for a recent wave of interest in digital audio storytelling. With more than 100 million downloads, it is one of the biggest and most impactful things to happen to its cottage industry. As Mark McCrery, CEO of Podtrac, the company that sells ads for Serial, said on stage, “Serial has reset the bar for how big podcasting can be.” With the bar reset, podcasting is moving into the big time. Or trying to, at least. Depending on whom you ask the 17 billion spent annually on radio advertising is up for grabs. On the music side, Pandora, Spotify and other streaming services are eating up billions in ad spending. And now, on the talk side, we have podcasting, which is admittedly measly. One report published before the Serial phenomenon predicted just 34 million in spending on podcast ads in 2016. The Podcast Upfronts featured many of the buzzwords used any advertising event: engaged audience, thought leaders, brand message, and 360 degree brand experience. But beyond that, it was not like other Upfront events. TV networks have thrown Upfront schmooze-fests since 1948 with the goal of dazzling advertisers with stars, booze, and a new slate of TV shows. Recently, digital media outlets joined in by throwing their own “Newfront” parties, even though it makes no logistical sense to sell digital ads a year in advance. Like podcasting itself, the Podcast Upfront was far more modest than the glitzy Midtown affairs thrown by TV networks. For one, playing an audio clip for an audience doesn’t quite have the same “wow” factor as a slick sizzle reel. Neither the audience nor the presenter knows where to look. And two, even though podcasting has attracted and created many stars, from radio personality Ira Glass and comedian Marc Maron to actor Alec Baldwin and reality show star Snooki, they weren’t there rubbing elbows with the ad execs. A small room filled with around 75 executives watched as representatives from companies like Podtrac, Midroll, and AdLarge bragged about the benefits of advertising on their shows. The average podcast listener has likely never heard of these companies, even though they represent some of the most popular podcasts. Podtrac sells ads for Serial and This American Life, the podcast version of the popular NPR radio show. Midroll sells ads for WTF with Marc Maron and Startalk with Neil DeGrasse Tyson. AdLarge sells ads for the AP’s podcasts. Panoply sells ads for Slate’s podcasts. They made a compelling case: Podcast listeners are loyal and passionate. They’re highly educated and have disposable income. McCrery argued they’re more effective than video and display ads, which may be true because most of the ad formats aren’t 30-second radio ads. Rather, they’re endorsements read by the podcast’s hosts, making them inherently more compelling and valuable. At one point, Farnoosh Torabi, the host of a popular personal finance podcast called So Money, concluded, as if it had just occurred to her, “Plain and simple, advertisers should get on board.” Her interviewer, AdLarge CEO Cathy Csukas, followed it up with a hard sell. “It’s an exciting time and important to get in now before it gets even more crowded,” she warned. But podcasters won’t take any ad they can get. In a potentially awkward moment, Leo Laporte, a podcasting pioneer who runs TWiT.tv, a network of technology-focused video and podcast shows, said he he turns down a lot of advertisers that want spots on his show. “Sorry guys,” he said after the audience emitted an audible grimace. Anyone who advertises on his show “has to be someone I consider worthy of our audience,” he explained. “These are hardcore endorsement deals.” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Serial, a popular true crime podcast, is one of the biggest and most impactful things to happen to digital audio storytelling with over 100 million downloads. This has led to a wave of interest in podcast advertising and the potential for ad spending in this format. The podcast industry is looking to move into competing with radio advertising, streaming services, and other digital ad platforms. Podcast listeners are seen as loyal, passionate, highly-educated, and possessing disposable income, making them an attractive audience for advertisers. Ad formats in podcasts often come in the form of endorsements read by the podcast's hosts, which can be more compelling and valuable than traditional 30-second radio ads."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Hertzler), about the creation of the 1984 commercial for Apple Computer, which introduced the first Macintosh. Jobs is trying to convey his idea that \\"We're creating a completely new consciousness.\\" Scott is more concerned with the technical aspects of the commercial. Next in 1997 with Jobs, returning to Apple, and announcing a new deal with Microsoft at the 1997 Macworld Expo. His partner, Steve Wozniak or \\"WOZ\\" (Joey Slotnick), is introduced as one of the two central narrators of the story. Wozniak notes to the audience the resemblance between Big Brother and the image of Bill Gates (Anthony Michael Hall) on the screen behind Jobs during this announcement. Asking how they \\"got from there to here,\\" the film turns to flashbacks of his youth with Jobs, prior to the forming of Apple. The earliest flashback is in 1971 and takes place on the U.C. Berkeley campus during the period of the student anti-war movements. Teenagers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are shown caught on the campus during a riot between students and police. They flee and after finding safety, Jobs states to Wozniak, \\"Those guys think they're revolutionaries. They're not revolutionaries, we are.\\" Wozniak then comments that \\"Steve was never like you or me. He always saw things differently. Even when I was in Berkeley, I would see something and just see kilobytes or circuit boards while he'd see karma or the meaning of the universe. Using a similar structure, the film next turns to a young Bill Gates at Harvard University, in the early 1970s, with classmate Steve Ballmer (John DiMaggio), and Gatesâ high school friend Paul Allen (Josh Hopkins). As with Wozniak in the earlier segment, Ballmer narrates Gates' story, particularly the moment when Gates discovers the existence of Ed Roberts's MITS Altair causing him to drop out of Harvard.

Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes).

Summarize this article: The back of your toilet seat is usually connected to the toilet with two long screws that run through the porcelain at the back of the bowl. The screws are secured by two nuts underneath. In the front of the cover, look for a small groove that is designed to help you pry up the cover. Then, use a small screwdriver to pry up both the seat and the cover. In cheap toilets, the screws are made of plastic. Most toilets, however, use steel screws, and more expensive models may even use brass or stainless steel. Be especially careful with plastic screws! If the seat is loose, then it may wobble back and forth, in and out of alignment with the rim of the toilet bowl. Straighten out the seat so that it rests evenly atop the bowl. Consider sitting down to test it out for comfort. Turn the screwdriver clockwise to tighten. Remember: \\"righty tighty, lefty loosey.\\" There's usually a nut with a wing attached to prevent the nut from turning. If there isn't, hold the nut with a rag while you tighten the bolt. Decide which screwdriver is the best fit. Make sure that the screwdriver head is big enough to fit into the notches of the bolt head. If the screwdriver is too small, then the bolt will not turn. The friction from the slipping screwdriver will quickly wear down the bolt and make it unusable. If the bolt keeps turning without tightening up, clamp the nut underneath with a small pair of pliers. Clamp onto the end of the nut, and hold it steady as you screw the bolt. Once you have twisted the bolt several times, the wing on the nut should prevent it from turning anymore. To loosen the nut, spray it with WD 40 and wait 5 minutes. When the bolt feels tight, give it one more quarter rotation so it's extra secure. Once the seat does not wobble back and forth, push down the lid. It should click closed.","completion":"This article explains the process of securing a loose toilet seat.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

UPDATED:. 11:47 EST, 11 June 2012. Prince Charles is the people's choice to succeed the Queen and take over the throne as King, a poll has revealed. Before the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, William was the country's preferred choice to be the next king. But in a dramatic shift of mood, Charles is now considered to be the best person to take over the throne. Popular: Prince Charles is the people's choice to succeed the Queen and take over the throne as King, a poll has revealed. He is pictured paying a moving tribute to 'Mummy' after Monday's Diamond Jubilee concert. Turnaround: A fortnight ago, Prince William was the favoured successor to the Queen. But since the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, Prince Charles is now the most popular choice. This could be because of his witty speech in praise of the Queen. The boost in Prince Charles' popularity may have been helped by his witty and emotional speech in praise of his mother at the close of the Diamond Jubilee Concert last Monday. His opening word – ‘Mummy’ – earned him rapturous cheers from the crowd as the Queen looked on delighted. As he drew to a close, he led the audience in giving three cheers for the Queen, before kissing her hand affectionately and adding: ‘So Your Majesty we offer you our humble duty and with it three resounding cheers for our Majesty The Queen!’ Next generation: Just a fortnight ago, 44 per cent of people said they preferred Prince William to be the next king. Another reason could be the way in which he stood in for his father, Prince Philip, who was hospitalised with a bladder infection which caused him to miss a large part of the Jubilee celebrations. The figures a fortnight ago revealed that 44 per cent of people preferred William to be the next king. This was compared with 38 per cent who preferred Charles. But since the successful Jubilee celebrations the figures have exactly reversed, according to a YouGov poll for The Sunday Times. The last time Charles was favoured to be the successor to the Queen was in 2005. Previously, he has struggled to shake off the perception among some members of the public that he is stuffy and pompous. But this has gradually altered over the years, thanks largely to his ideas for reform. He is believed to have been talking privately to aides for a number of years about a stripped-down monarchy - something which was demonstrated last week when the core members of the Royal family appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on the final day of the Jubilee celebrations. The Queen appeared with Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Just Prince Philip was missing as he was being treated in hospital for his illness. The poll also revealed that William remains as popular as the Queen with 86 per cent of people considering them to be an asset to the royal family. Prince Philip yesterday celebrated his 91st birthday quietly with his family after spending five nights in hospital. He was discharged from the King Edward VII Hospital in central London on Saturday after being treated for a bladder infection. When asked if he was feeling better, the Duke of Edinburgh replied: ‘I wouldn’t be coming out otherwise.’ Buckingham Palace said he would ‘continue his convalescence’ at home but could not confirm if he would accompany the Queen to a garden party at Sandringham tomorrow. The Duchess of Cambridge polled 81 per cent with Prince Harry slightly behind - but still popular- on 75 per cent. Reflecting the astonishing success of the Jubilee celebrations, 33 per cent of people said they feel more proud to be British following last weekend's events. A total of 29 per cent also said they felt more positive towards the royal family since the Jubilee celebrations. During Charles' popular speech last Monday, he paid tribute to ‘the life and service of a very special person’. He told the Queen: ‘A Diamond Jubilee. is a unique and special event, some of us have had the joy of. celebrating three jubilees with you, and I have the medals to prove it. ‘And we're now celebrating the life and service of a very special person, over the last 60 years. ‘I. was three when my grandfather George VI died and suddenly,. unexpectedly, you and my father's lives were irrevocably changed when. you were only 26. ‘So as a nation this is our opportunity to thank you and my father for always being there for us. ‘For inspiring us with your selfless duty and service and for making us proud to be British.’ Stripped back: Prince Charles is believed to be in favour of a slimmed-down monarchy. Just the core members of the royal family appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on the final day of the Jubilee celebrations. Success: Since the Jubilee celebrations, 33 per cent of people said they feel more proud to be British. Supportive: A total of 29 per cent of people also said they felt more positive towards the royal family since the Jubilee celebrations.

Article:","completion":"Title: Nurturing a Positive Environment for Social Interaction Introduction In today's fast-paced world, it is imperative to build strong and supportive relationships with the people around us. Whether in personal or professional scenarios, social interactions play a crucial role in one's mental and emotional well-being. Building on this foundation, it becomes an individual's responsibility to contribute to a pleasant environment for social interaction. This article provides guidelines to act positively, be supportive, avoid awkwardness, and make everyone feel comfortable during social encounters, ultimately fostering healthy communication. 1. Act Positively Adopting a positive attitude is the first step in setting the tone for meaningful social interactions. Approach every conversation with enthusiasm and genuine interest in the other person. Listen attentively and respond thoughtfully to promote open and active engagement. Staying optimistic not only encourages healthy communication but also elevates the mood of individuals participating in the conversation. 2. Be Supportive Being a supportive friend or colleague involves offering encouragement, understanding, and empathy. Validate people's feelings and acknowledge their opinions even if you might not agree with them. Supporting others does not mean blindly agreeing with them but rather being present, showing respect, and understanding the context of their experiences. 3. Avoid Awkward Situations Nobody enjoys uncomfortable moments during social interactions. Pick up on verbal and non-verbal cues that may indicate when to change the subject or wrap up a conversation. Avoid controversial or deeply personal topics unless you are sure that the person you are talking to is open to discussing them. Furthermore, be mindful of time, as lengthy conversations may lead to awkward silence. Curating a comfortable environment for everyone leads to more enjoyable interactions and stronger bonds. 4. Bring Your Phone but Use it Wisely Having your phone handy may appear contradictory to engaging in a wholesome conversation. However, using it wisely can save everyone from potential awkwardness, like when searching for a shared talking point such as a video or an article. Nevertheless, be mindful of screen time and avoid getting absorbed in your device to maintain a strong connection with the person you are talking to. 5. Let Them Know if You Feel Uncomfortable In the event that you feel uncomfortable or threatened during any social interaction, it is crucial to express your feelings. Politely let the person know that the topic of conversation is causing discomfort and suggest a change of subject. Establishing boundaries and asserting yourself can foster healthier relationships and create an atmosphere of mutual respect. 6. Invite Someone Else to Join the Conversation Should you find yourself in an uncomfortable one-on-one conversation, consider inviting someone else to participate. This tactic not only diffuses the tension but also provides an opportunity to bring fresh perspectives and ideas into the discussion. By doing so, the entire interaction may become more enjoyable as conversation flows with the additional input. 7. Go Somewhere Else Finally, if all else fails or the environment becomes intolerable, politely remove yourself from the situation. Suggesting to move to a different location or pausing the conversation to grab a drink provides a natural exit strategy. Navigating uncomfortable scenarios with grace protects your well-being while maintaining a positive atmosphere for others present. Conclusion Cultivating a positive environment for social interaction is paramount for healthy relationships and emotional well-being. By adopting these guidelines, one can nurture fulfilling connections with friends, family, and colleagues while effectively managing any awkward or uncomfortable situations that may arise. Fostering pleasant and respectful communication not only improves personal experiences but also contributes to the overall harmony among the people in our lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Seconds later the 2005 Dodge Magnum station wagon had accelerated to 153 mph, according to the police car’s moving radar system. After travelling about 10 miles down the highway, the car exited and pulled into a parking lot behind a building where police apprehended him and charged him with reckless driving, WWJ-TV reports.

Police say the 21-year-old had a clean record and didn’t offer any explanation for his actions, but he now faces up to six points on his license and a maximum of 93 days in jail. ||||| WOODHAVEN (WWJ) – A young man who drove a little too fast and furious on a Downriver freeway could possibly wind up in jail. Michigan State Police Lt. Mike Shaw said the situation unfolded around 3 a.m. Tuesday as troopers were running traffic detail on northbound I-75 near West Road in Woodhaven. “They clocked a vehicle preceding 79 in a 70 mile an hour zone,” Shaw told WWJ’s Laura Bonnell. “As the troopers turned around on the vehicle to effect a traffic stop, the vehicle was clocked on their moving radar at approximately a mile down the road from where they first initially saw him, at 153 miles an hour.” Troopers followed the vehicle until it exited at Eureka Road and pulled behind a business. “In the parking lot, troopers made contact with the driver, at which time he was arrested for reckless driving,” Shaw said. The 21-year-old Lincoln Park man, who has no prior driving offenses, was processed at the state police metro post in Taylor and his 2005 Dodge Magnum was impounded. Authorities are now seeking charges from the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office. “It’s six points on your driving record and it depends, but you could do 93 days in jail and a fine, depending on what the judge sentences,” said Shaw. The man didn’t give an explanation for why he was driving so fast, but he was traveling more than 2.5 miles per minute. Shaw said there’s absolutely no reason for any driver to reach speeds of that magnitude. “The roads are not designed for 150 miles an hour and most of our drivers probably aren’t professionally trained to drive at that speed,” said Shaw. “Unfortunately, some of the cars that are out on the roads today can do that speed, but we don’t recommend 150 mile an hour anywhere in Michigan’s road system.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"A 21-year-old driver was spotted by Michigan State Police doing 79 mph in a 70 mph zone on I-75 near Woodhaven, which led to a police pursuit. The driver's 2005 Dodge Magnum station wagon accelerated to 153 mph during the chase before exiting the highway and pulling into a parking lot where he was apprehended. He was charged with reckless driving and now faces up to six points on his license and a maximum of 93 days in jail. The car, which originally had a speed restrictor set at 130 mph, appeared to have been modified to achieve such high speeds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the background: The first direct observational hint that the universe has a finite age came from the observations of 'recession velocities', mostly by Vesto Slipher, combined with distances to the 'nebulae' (galaxies) by Edwin Hubble in a work published in 1929. Earlier in the 20th century, Hubble and others resolved individual stars within certain nebulae, thus determining that they were galaxies, similar to, but external to, our Milky Way Galaxy. In addition, these galaxies were very large and very far away. Spectra taken of these distant galaxies showed a red shift in their spectral lines presumably caused by the Doppler effect, thus indicating that these galaxies were moving away from the Earth. In addition, the farther away these galaxies seemed to be (the dimmer they appeared to us) the greater was their redshift, and thus the faster they seemed to be moving away. This was the first direct evidence that the universe is not static but expanding. The first estimate of the age of the universe came from the calculation of when all of the objects must have started speeding out from the same point. Hubble's initial value for the universe's age was very low, as the galaxies were assumed to be much closer than later observations found them to be. and the situation: Bob is an astrophysicist. He was pondering about the beginning of our universe. He pinpointed the time when the universe just began to exist. He labeled it as point A. To compare it with present situation of the universe he labeled the present time as point B. Answer the following question: In which time the redshift was greater, point A or point B?","completion":"To answer this question, let's break down the relevant concepts and think step-by-step: 1. Redshift: Redshift is the phenomenon where the spectral lines of an object are shifted towards the red end of the spectrum due to the Doppler effect. This occurs when an object is moving away from the observer. In the context of the universe, the redshift of a galaxy serves as an indicator of its distance and relative velocity. 2. Expansion of the universe: As mentioned in the background information, the universe is expanding, and the farther away a galaxy is, the greater its redshift, meaning it is moving away faster. 3. Point A and Point B: Point A represents the beginning of the universe, and Point B represents the present time. Now that we've broken down the concepts, we can analyze the situation: At Point A, the universe had just begun, and everything was closer together. As time passed and the universe expanded, galaxies moved away from each other, leading to an increase in redshift. At Point B, the present time, galaxies have continued to move away from each other due to the expansion of the universe. This results in an increase in redshift as well, since farther galaxies have greater redshifts. Comparing both points in time, we can conclude that the redshift is greater at Point B (present time) than it was at Point A (the beginning of the universe). This is because the universe has expanded over time and galaxies have moved further apart."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

PUBLISHED:. 21:07 EST, 30 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 21:08 EST, 30 July 2013. The ongoing spat over national security spending between Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie reached a fever pitch on Tuesday, with Paul referring to the plus-sized Christie as 'the king of bacon.' 'This is the king of bacon talking about bacon,' Paul told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Both are considered potential 2016 contenders for the Republican presidential nomination. Paul's remark was in response to Christie's comments earlier in the day that Paul brings millions in 'pork' spending back to his home state of Kentucky. How Rude! Senator Rand Paul called Chris Christie - the plus-sized governor of New Jersey - 'the king of bacon' 'So if Senator Paul wants to start looking at where he's going to cut. spending to afford defense, maybe he should start cutting the pork. barrel spending that he brings home to Kentucky,' Christie told reporters. Christie last week criticized Paul’s opposition to warrantless federal surveillance programs, saying it harmed efforts to prevent terrorism. Paul told reporters after speaking at a fundraiser outside Nashville on Sunday that Christie’s position hurts GOP chances in national elections, and that spending priorities of critics like the governor and Rep. Peter King of New York do more to harm national security. 'They’re precisely the same people who are unwilling to cut the spending, and their \\"Gimme, gimme, gimme — give me all my Sandy money now.’” Paul said, referring to federal funding after the hurricane last year. 'Those are the people who are bankrupting the government and not letting enough money be left over for national defense.' The king: Christie has been struggling with his weight for years and recently underwent gastric band surgery. King in a phone interview late Sunday called Paul’s criticism of Sandy aid 'indefensible.' 'This was absolutely life or death money that was essential to New York and New Jersey,' King said. Christie, at a forum in Colorado on Thursday, pointed to a 'strain of libertarianism' coursing through both parties as a 'very dangerous thought' more than a decade after the Sept. 11 attacks. Christie was asked whether he was referring to Paul, a fellow potential Republican presidential candidate who has been at the forefront of the party’s libertarian wing. 'You can name any number of people and he’s one of them,' said Christie. 'These esoteric, intellectual debates — I want them to come to New Jersey and sit across from the widows and the orphans and have that conversation. And they won’t, because that’s a much tougher conversation to have.' War of words: Christie and Paul have been feuding for weeks about Paul's libertarian leanings. Paul on Sunday rejected arguments that the National Security Agency’s collection of hundreds of millions of U.S. phone and Internet records is necessary to prevent terrorism. 'I don’t mind spying on terrorists,' he said. 'I just don’t like spying on all Americans.' Paul said the issue resonates particularly with young people, a key demographic Republicans need to attract in order to succeed in national elections. 'If you talk about some privacy issues like that, I think you will find youth coming to you,' said Paul, who said his own decision on whether to run for president won’t come until next year. King called that argument misguided. 2016: Both Christie and Paul are considered to be potential presidential candidates for the 2016 election. 'When it comes to national defense, we shouldn’t be pandering to any demographic,' he said. 'We need to do what’s best for the country.' Messages left with Christie’s office late Sunday were not immediately returned. As for the back and forth with Christie, Paul said he wasn’t the one itching for a fight. 'I didn’t start this one, and I don’t plan on starting things by criticizing other Republicans,' he said. 'But if they want to make me the target, they will get it back in spades.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article discusses the ongoing spat over national security spending between Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, both of whom are potential contenders for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.

After waiting for over 20 minutes to have our orders taken, we started questioning the choice of coming to this restaurant. When the food finally arrived after nearly an hour, there was little to be excited about. My steak was severely overcooked and had a burnt taste, while the vegetables were soggy and flavorless. My dining partner's pasta was swimming in a pool of watery sauce, and the overall presentation was unappetizing. Even the ambiance of the place was unbearable.

But before that, let's simplify the equation by combining the numbers on the right side: 112153 - 663904 = -551751 So our simplified equation is: -9999*w + 718122 = -551751 3. Now, let's get all the numbers (constants) to one side and the \\"w\\" term to the other side. We'll subtract 718122 from both sides of the equation: -9999*w + 718122 - 718122 = -551751 - 718122 -9999*w = -1269873 4. To find the value of \\"w\\", we have to divide both sides by -9999: w = -1269873 / -9999 w = 127 So the answer is \\"w = 127\\".

Question: What does Matthew try to do when seeing Patty and Crick fighting? Movie title: 100 Girls Movie plot: After leaving a party at a women's dormitory (aka the \\"virgin vault\\"), Matthew (Jonathan Tucker) is trapped in an elevator with an unknown, and unseen, woman when the power goes out. Matthew and this unknown woman have sex in the dark. When Matthew wakes up in the morningâstill in the elevatorâhe finds himself alone with a pair of her panties.[1] On a mission to find his mystery maiden by finding a matching bra for the panties, Matthew becomes the maintenance man of the virgin vault. After releasing mice, he goes room to room, setting traps. He convinces the panicked women to leave their rooms and then starts to look for a match. When he is unsuccessful, he continues to break things (such as the air conditioning) in an effort to find his woman. He also fixes the television set, which is greatly received by women he refers to as \\"Jane-ites\\", as they have a great interest in films adapted from books by Jane Austen. He doesn't get much help from his roommate Rod (James DeBello), who keeps telling him to give up, and together they philosophize about men and women. Rod tells him that he doesn't need a girlfriend and that it's futile to try to find the \\"bra matching the panties\\", and Matthew accuses him of being too machismo. Rod introduces Matthew to the \\"penile power\\", which involves the use of weights attached to his penis as a means of increasing the organ's size. He does this and insults women to make himself feel better about the problem he has with his manhood; he suffers from hypospadias. Early on, Matthew watches as a woman named Patty (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and her boyfriend Crick (Johnny Green) fight. Crick is the epitome of the macho man stereotype, with his big pectorals, conceited attitude, and abusiveness. He wears a pony-tail, a manicured goatee, \\"male make-up\\", and chews nicotine gum, much to Matthew's dismay. Matthew tries to save Patty, but is hurt by Crick.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 0 = 50*r - 42*r + 88*r + 1056 for r.","completion":"To solve the equation 0 = 50*r - 42*r + 88*r + 1056 for r, we first need to simplify the equation by combining the terms with r together. Step 1: Combine like terms The like terms are 50*r, -42*r, and 88*r. To combine them, add or subtract their coefficients. 50*r - 42*r + 88*r = (50 - 42 + 88)*r = 96*r Now, the simplified equation is: 0 = 96*r + 1056 Step 2: Solve for r To solve for r, we need to isolate r by getting it on one side of the equation and the constants on the other side. First, we will move the constant term (1056) to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides. This will give us 0 - 1056 = 96*r - 1056 + 1056 => -1056 = 96*r Now, to isolate r, we'll divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of r, which is 96. -1056 / 96 = 96*r / 96 => -11 = r So the solution to the equation 0 = 50*r - 42*r + 88*r + 1056 is r = -11."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question The basis for classical economics forms Adam Smith's An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, published in 1776. Smith criticized mercantilism, advocating a system of free trade with division of labour. He postulated an \\"invisible hand\\" that regulated economic systems made up of actors guided only by self-interest. Karl Marx developed an alternative economic theory, called Marxian economics. Marxian economics is based on the labor theory of value and assumes the value of good to be based on the amount of labor required to produce it. Under this assumption, capitalism was based on employers not paying the full value of workers labor to create profit. The Austrian school responded to Marxian economics by viewing entrepreneurship as driving force of economic development. This replaced the labor theory of value by a system of supply and demand. What idea did Adam Smith propose?","completion":"Adam Smith proposed the idea of an \\"invisible hand\\" that regulated economic systems made up of actors guided only by self-interest.

Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, while village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village didn't display an observable Allee effect? Hint: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

As stated by the rapporteur, Mr Manders, the Commission will also evaluate the link between allergies and chemicals used in textile products. Translate to Finnish Finnish:","completion":"Kuten esittelijä, herra Manders totesi, komissio arvioi myös yhteyden allergioiden ja tekstiilituotteissa käytettyjen kemikaalien välillä. Suomeksi: Kuten raportoija, herra Manders mainitsi, komissio tulee myös arvioimaan allergioiden ja tekstiilituotteissa käytettävien kemiallisten aineiden välisen yhteyden. Tämä on tärkeää, sillä kuluttajien terveyden suojeluun liittyvät kysymykset ovat olennainen osa tekstiilialaa ja tuotteiden turvallisuutta. Allergiat ovat yleinen ongelma, ja on tärkeää ymmärtää, miten erilaiset kemikaalit vaikuttavat näihin terveysongelmiin. Arvioitaessa allergioiden ja kemikaalien välistä yhteyttä on otettava huomioon monia tekijöitä. Yksi näistä tekijöistä on se, millaisia kemiallisia aineita tekstiilituotteissa yleensä käytetään, kuten väriaineet, pehmennysaineet, kyllästysaineet ja palonestoaineet. Näillä aineilla voi olla erilaisia vaikutuksia ihmisten terveyteen, minkä vuoksi niiden käyttöä on säänneltävä. Lisäksi tulee ottaa huomioon kemikaalien pitoisuudet ja altistumisen kesto. Joskus matalatkin pitoisuudet voivat pitkäaikaisessa altistumisessa aiheuttaa allergisia reaktioita ihmisillä, jotka ovat herkkiä tietyille aineille. Myös eri yksilöiden väliset geneettiset erot voivat vaikuttaa siihen, miten he reagoivat altistuessaan kemikaaleille. Eri maiden ja alueiden lainsäädäntö voi myös vaikuttaa käytettyjen kemikaalien saantoon ja siten allergiariskeihin. Vaikka Euroopan unionissa on tiukat kemikaalien käyttöä koskevat säädökset esimerkiksi REACH-asetuksen myötä, on tärkeää varmistaa, että myös EU:n ulkopuolelta tuoduissa tuotteissa noudatetaan samoja standardeja. Tämä voi auttaa vähentämään allergioita aiheuttavien kemikaalien riskiä kuluttajille. Tutkimus ja innovaatio ovat myös keskeisessä asemassa allergioiden ja kemikaalien välisen yhteyden ymmärtämisessä. Tekstiilialan kehityksen myötä uusia kemiallisia aineita kehitetään jatkuvasti, ja niitä voidaan hyödyntää tekstiilituotteiden parantamiseksi. Samalla on kuitenkin tärkeää tutkia ja ymmärtää näiden aineiden vaikutuksia ihmisten terveyteen, jotta voidaan kehittää tehokkaita strategioita ja ratkaisuja allergiariskin minimointiin. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että komission suorittaman allergioiden ja tekstiilituotteissa käytettyjen kemikaalien välisen yhteyden arvioinnin on otettava huomioon useita seikkoja, kuten kemikaalien tyypit, pitoisuudet, altistumisen kesto sekä lainsäädännölliset erot ja innovaatio. Tämän arvioinnin avulla voidaan saavuttaa parempi ymmärrys allergiariskeistä ja auttaa kehittämään tehokkaita toimenpiteitä allergioiden ehkäisemiseksi ja kuluttajien terveyden suojelemiseksi."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole.

Brainstorm solutions With a clear understanding of the source of your fear, you can start developing strategies to overcome it. It’s crucial to brainstorm different approaches, as one solution might not fit every individual or situation. Some common strategies include: - Educating yourself on the source of fear to dispel irrational beliefs - Seeking professional help such as therapy or counseling - Adopting a healthier lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet - Practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation - Surrounding yourself with a supportive network of friends and family 4.

Process: - Coal is put in a coal-fired steam station - Water is put in pipes in the coal-fired steam station - The coal is crushed - The coal is moved into a boiler along with hot air - The water is moving through pipes in the boiler - The steam from the water is blown against a turning mechanism - The force of the steam makes the mechanism turn - The mechanism generates electricity. Question: suppose less electricity needed happens, how will it affect less electricity is produced. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"If less electricity is needed, the demand for electricity decreases. To accommodate this decrease in demand, the coal-fired steam station can reduce the quantity of coal being burnt, leading to less heat production. The steps influenced by this change would be as follows: 1. Coal is put in a coal-fired steam station (less coal is required) 2. Water is put in pipes in the coal-fired steam station (the same amount of water can be used) 3. The coal is crushed (less coal is crushed) 4. The coal is moved into a boiler along with hot air (less coal is moved) 5. The water is moving through pipes in the boiler (the water moves through at the same rate) 6. The steam from the water is blown against a turning mechanism (less steam is produced) 7. The force of the steam makes the mechanism turn (the mechanism turns slower) 8.

I'd like to be at your #openlab, but I have trouble getting there. Can you help with a teleporting device? Select from: -negative -positive","completion":"The sentiment of the tweet can be analyzed from various aspects. Overall, the sentiment of the tweet in question can be described as a mixture of positive and negative sentiments. Here, I'll dive into both the aspects and discuss the reasons. Positive Sentiments: 1. The opening of the tweet starts with a friendly and upbeat tone with the word 'Hey!'. 2. The tweet expresses a keen interest in attending David's #openlab, indicating some excitement or enthusiasm towards the event or the person organizing it (David). 3. The use of humor shows that the user is engaging in a lighthearted way by asking for a teleporting device, which could indicate their level of comfort with David and the event. Negative Sentiments: 1. The tweet mentions that the user is having trouble reaching the event location, which implies that they are facing difficulties and maybe mildly frustrated or disappointed. 2. In addition, the request for a teleporting device could be considered as sarcastic, possibly implying the event is too far for the user, or it is difficult for them to deal with the difficulties that come with attending the event. Considering all the points above, it is challenging to definitively classify the tweet's sentiment as entirely positive or negative. The tweet conveys a combination of positive sentiments through the excitement and enthusiasm for the #openlab event as well as the friendly tone and humor. On the other hand, it also contains negative sentiments due to the difficulty in reaching the event and possibly even mild sarcasm. However, if forced to choose between only negative or positive categorization, I would suggest that the tweet leans more toward a positive sentiment. The reason being that although it mentions a difficulty (having trouble reaching the event), the tone remains largely upbeat and enthusiastic. The negative aspect might simply be mentioning the obstacle faced, not necessarily expressing dissatisfaction or disapproval."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","completion":"The strikes and rioting across France in October 2010 were primarily driven by widespread opposition to proposed pension reforms by then-President Nicolas Sarkozy's government. The comprehensive answer to this issue involves examining various factors, including the French political climate, the nature of the proposed pension reforms, the role of labor unions, and the public's response. 1. Political climate in France: In 2010, France was grappling with economic challenges brought on by the global financial crisis as well as domestic issues such as high unemployment rates, public spending constraints, and concerns over the future sustainability of the French welfare system. President Nicolas Sarkozy, as part of his center-right platform, sought to implement a series of policy changes in response to these challenges. 2. Proposed pension reforms: One of the most controversial policies proposed by Sarkozy's government was the pension reform plan. At the heart of the dispute was the proposal to raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full retirement age, when individuals can claim their full pension, from 65 to 67. The government argued that these changes were necessary to address France's growing fiscal deficit, an aging population, and to ensure the long-term solvency of the pension system. 3. Role of labor unions: Labor unions, such as the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT) played a crucial role in organizing the strikes and protests against the proposed reforms. They argued that the changes would disproportionately impact low-income workers who rely on pension benefits and have shorter life expectancies. The unions also expressed concerns that the reforms could lead to increased pressure on older workers to continue working despite difficulties finding employment in a challenging job market. 4. Public's response: The broader French public seemed to share the labor unions' concerns and dissatisfaction with the proposed pension reforms. Opinion polls suggested that a majority of the French population opposed the changes, with some polls even indicating that over 70% of respondents were against the proposed increase in retirement age. This widespread disapproval translated into massive street protests, demonstrations, and strikes that spanned various sectors of the workforce, including transport, energy, education, and public services. The strikes and rioting in October 2010 escalated to the point where France experienced fuel shortages, school closures, and disruptions to public transportation. The unrest received international attention and put significant pressure on Sarkozy's government. Despite this fierce opposition, the French parliament ultimately approved the pension reform legislation by the end of October 2010, and it was enacted into law in November of the same year. The strikes and rioting represent a pivotal moment in France's recent social and political history, as they demonstrated the deep-rooted tensions between the government's efforts to respond to economic challenges and a significant portion of the population's resistance to these changes, particularly those directly impacting their social welfare."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer this question: Which letter in the Morse code is represented by a single dot?","completion":"In Morse code, the letter that is represented by a single dot is the letter \\"E\\". Morse code is a method of representing letters, numbers, and other characters by using a combination of dots and dashes (also known as dits and dahs). It was developed by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in the 1830s and was a crucial communication tool during the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly for telegraph communications. Morse code uses a system of standardized sequences of short and long signals, or marks, to represent each character. The duration of a dot is the basic unit of time measurement, and a dash is three times longer than a dot. The space between parts that make up the same letter is equal to the duration of a single dot, while the space between letters is three times that of a dot. The space between words is equal to the duration of seven dots. The simplicity of a single dot for the letter \\"E\\" in Morse code is likely due to its high frequency in the English language. Morse and Vail intended for the length of the code for each character to be roughly inversely proportional to the frequency of that character in typical messages. As a result, often-used letters such as \\"E\\" and \\"T\\" have shorter codes, while less frequently used characters have more complex codes. Here is a list of the 26 Morse code representations for the letters of the English alphabet: A: .- B: -... C: -.-. D: -.. E: . F: ..-. G: --. H: .... I: .. J: .--- K: -.- L: .-.. M: -- N: -. O: --- P: .--. Q: --.- R: .-. S: ... T: - U: ..- V: ...- W: .-- X: -..- Y: -.-- Z: --.. The invention of the Morse code significantly improved long-distance communication and laid the foundation for modern telecommunication advancements. Although it is no longer used as prominently as it once was, Morse code is still applicable in certain contexts, such as aviation and maritime communication, and is useful for people with disabilities as a means of communication. It endures as an important element in the history of technology and communication."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let me explain them to you like you're a five-year-old! 1. When you say \\"I miss you\\" to a guy, and he says \\"Thank you\\" only, it means that he appreciates you telling him how you feel. But, it doesn't necessarily mean he misses you or has the same feelings like you do.

Article: While most faux suede fabrics used for clothing, towels, drapery, and other garments, accessories, or decor will be machine washable, always check the labels first to be sure. If the label is missing or too worn to read, err on the side of caution: hand wash the garment with a gentle soap or detergent and hang or lay it to dry. A care label with a washing basin full of water on it means you can machine wash your item. If there is a number as well, this indicates the temperature at which to wash it. For a washing basin with a hand on it, wash the garment by hand instead of the washing machine. A square with a circle inside means you can tumble dry your garment as well. A single circle means dry clean only. A triangle means it’s safe to use bleach. If any of these symbols appear on your care label with an X or cross through them, it means you cannot use that method of cleaning. Before washing or cleaning any new fabric, you should always do a spot test on the fabric to ensure that the cleaning product you want to use won’t damage the fabric in any way. Choose a small spot on the fabric that won’t be seen, and apply a small amount of your desired cleaner to the area. Let it sit for five to 10 minutes, and blot the area with a clean, white cloth. Check to see that no color bleeding, discoloration, or shrinking has occurred. Use a damp cloth to remove the cleaner. For tough stains or hard-to-clean dirt, spot clean the stains with soapy water, a clear alcohol like isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol or vodka, or a gentle liquid laundry detergent that’s been diluted in water (use a teaspoon (6 ml) of detergent in one cup (240 ml) of water). To spot clean: Apply a small bit of cleaner to the fabric with a cloth or clean sponge. Gently rub the area with either the sponge, a lint-free cloth, or a soft-bristled brush, such as a clean toothbrush. If you use a cloth or sponge, make sure it’s white or undyed, as the dye could transfer to the fabric. Sometimes fabrics just don’t want to come clean, but there are methods you can use to remove stubborn stains from your favorite clothes. To remove deodorant or perspiration stains, rub a small amount of liquid laundry soap into the armpit areas and let it sit for 10 minutes before washing. For oil stains, lay the stain face-down on a clean wash cloth or hand towel. Pour some liquid laundry soap onto the back of the stain and let it sit. As the oil and soap soak through and dry, replace the cloth with a clean one. Rinse the area once it has dried and launder it normally. To get rid of stubborn organic matter (such as food, beverages, grass, and blood), pre-treat the stains by rubbing them with a detergent that contains enzymes, such as OxiClean, Tide Stain Release, and Ultra Plus. Let it sit for 10 minutes and wash normally. For machine-washable items, always wash faux suede items together to prevent the material from collecting lint. Wash larger items, such as curtains and bedding, alone. To machine wash a single faux suede item, place it in a lingerie bag to separate it from the rest of the clothes in the load. To be on the safe side, always use the delicate or gentle cycle and a mild liquid detergent when washing faux suede. To hand wash your item, fill a large bowl or sink with warm, soapy water. Place your item in the water and let it absorb the water. Gently agitate the fabric with your hands, concentrating on areas that are particularly soiled. If the care label indicates that your item is safe for the dryer, follow the heat settings, or use a low- or no-heat setting to dry your faux suede. You can also hang your items to dry on a clothesline, or lay them flat on a towel to dry. Washing faux suede can make the fabric stiff. Use a soft brush or clean toothbrush to gently brush the fabric and return its softness. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article is about how to properly wash and take care of faux suede materials, like clothes and home items.

Question: Information: - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - An explosive eruption is a volcanic term to describe a violent, explosive type of eruption. Mount St. Helens in 1980 was an example. Such eruptions result when sufficient gas has dissolved under pressure within a viscous magma such that expelled lava violently froths into volcanic ash when pressure is suddenly lowered at the vent. Sometimes a lava plug will block the conduit to the summit, and when this occurs, eruptions are more violent. Explosive eruptions can send rocks, dust, gas and pyroclastic material up to 20 km into the atmosphere at rate of up to 100,000 tonnes per second, traveling at several hundred meters per second. This cloud will then collapse, creating a pyroclastic flow of hot volcanic matter. - A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \\"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\\". - An effusive eruption is a type of volcanic eruption in which lava steadily flows out of a volcano onto the ground. Effusive eruption differs from explosive eruption, wherein magma is violently fragmented when expelled from a volcano. The shape of the lava flows created by effusive eruptions is governed by the type of lava, rate and duration of eruption, and slope of the surrounding areas. - Bristol Bay (\\"Iilgayaq\\" in Central Yup'ik) is the eastern-most arm of the Bering Sea, at 57° to 59° North 157° to 162° West in Southwest Alaska. Bristol Bay is 400 km (250 mi) long and 290 km, (180 mi) wide at its mouth. A number of rivers flow into the bay, including the Cinder, Egegik, Igushik, Kvichak, Meshik, Nushagak, Naknek, Togiak, and Ugashik. - The Alaska Peninsula is a peninsula extending about to the southwest from the mainland of Alaska and ending in the Aleutian Islands. The peninsula separates the Pacific Ocean from Bristol Bay, an arm of the Bering Sea. - A shield volcano is a type of volcano usually built almost entirely of fluid lava flows. They are named for their low profile, resembling a warrior's shield lying on the ground. This is caused by the highly fluid lava they erupt, which travels farther than lava erupted from stratovolcanoes. This results in the steady accumulation of broad sheets of lava, building up the shield volcano's distinctive form. The shape of shield volcanoes is due to the low viscosity of their mafic lava. - A caldera is a large cauldron-like depression that forms following the evacuation of a magma chamber/reservoir. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time period, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland. - Andesite (or ) is an extrusive igneous, volcanic rock, of intermediate composition, with aphanitic to porphyritic texture. In a general sense, it is the intermediate type between basalt and dacite, and ranges from 57 to 63% silicon dioxide (SiO) as illustrated in TAS diagrams. The mineral assemblage is typically dominated by plagioclase plus pyroxene or hornblende. Magnetite, zircon, apatite, ilmenite, biotite, and garnet are common accessory minerals. Alkali feldspar may be present in minor amounts. The quartz-feldspar abundances in andesite and other volcanic rocks are illustrated in QAPF diagrams. - Mount Dutton is a stratovolcano in the Aleutian Range of the U.S. state of Alaska , on the Alaska Peninsula . - The Bering Strait (\\"Beringov proliv\\", Yupik: \\"Imakpik\\") is a strait of the Pacific, which borders with the Arctic to north. It is located between Russia and the United States. Named after Vitus Bering, a Danish-born explorer in the service of the Russian Empire, it lies slightly south of the Arctic Circle being at about 65° 40' N latitude. The present Russia-US east-west boundary is at 168° 58' 37\\" W. - Katmai National Park and Preserve is a United States National Park and Preserve in southern Alaska, notable for the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes and for its Alaskan brown bears. The park and preserve covers , being roughly the size of Wales. Most of this is a designated wilderness area in the national park where all hunting is banned, including over of land. The park is named after Mount Katmai, its centerpiece stratovolcano. The park is located on the Alaska Peninsula, across from Kodiak Island, with headquarters in nearby King Salmon, about southwest of Anchorage. The area was first designated a national monument in 1918 to protect the area around the major 1912 volcanic eruption of Novarupta, which formed the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, a , pyroclastic flow. The park includes as many as 18 individual volcanoes, seven of which have been active since 1900. - The Bering Sea is a marginal sea of the Pacific Ocean. It comprises a deep water basin, which then rises through a narrow slope into the shallower water above the continental shelves. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - Wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by civilized human activity. It may also be defined as: \\"The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planetthose last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure.\\" - Rhyolite is an igneous, volcanic rock, of felsic (silica-rich) composition (typically > 69% SiOsee the TAS classification). It may have any texture from glassy to aphanitic to porphyritic. The mineral assemblage is usually quartz, sanidine and plagioclase (in a ratio > 2:1see the QAPF diagram). Biotite and hornblende are common accessory minerals. It is the extrusive equivalent to granite. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas. - The Aleutian Range is a major mountain range located in southwest Alaska, and it extends from Chakachamna Lake (80 miles/130 km southwest of Anchorage) to Unimak Island, which is at the tip of the Alaska Peninsula. It includes all of the mountains of the peninsula, and what makes it so special is its large number of active volcanoes, which are also part of the larger Aleutian Arc. The mainland part of the range is about 600 miles (1000 km) long; the Aleutian Islands are (geologically) a partially submerged western extension of the range that stretches for another 1,600 km (1000 mi). However the official designation \\"Aleutian Range\\" includes only the mainland peaks and the peaks on Unimak Island. The range is almost entirely roadless wilderness, and Katmai National Park and Preserve, a large national park within the range, must be reached by boat or plane. - Unimak Island is the largest island in the Aleutian Islands chain of the U.S. state of Alaska. - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean. - Yukon (also commonly called the Yukon) is the westernmost and smallest of Canada's three federal territories (the other two are Northwest Territories and Nunavut). The territory is very sparsely populated with its about 35,000 people on almost half a million square kilometres. Whitehorse is the territorial capital and Yukon's only city. - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - In geology, felsic refers to igneous rocks that are relatively rich in elements that form feldspar and quartz. It is contrasted with mafic rocks, which are relatively richer in magnesium and iron. It refers to those rocks rich in silicate minerals, magma, and rocks which are enriched in the lighter elements such as silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, and potassium. - Sovereignty is understood in jurisprudence as the full right and power of a governing body to govern itself without any interference from outside sources or bodies. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme authority over some polity. It is a basic principle underlying the dominant Westphalian model of state foundation. - Pumice, called pumicite in its powdered or dust form, is a volcanic rock that consists of highly vesicular rough textured volcanic glass, which may or may not contain crystals. It is typically light colored. Scoria is another vesicular volcanic rock that differs from pumice in having larger vesicles, thicker vesicle walls and being dark colored and denser. - The Anchorage Metropolitan Statistical Area , as defined by the United States Census Bureau, is an area consisting of the Municipality of Anchorage and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough in the south central region of Alaska. - British Columbia (BC) is the westernmost province of Canada, with a population of more than four million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity. - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets. - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy. - The Aleutian Arc is a large volcanic arc in the U.S. state of Alaska. It consists of a number of active and dormant volcanoes that have formed as a result of subduction along the Aleutian Trench. Although taking its name from the Aleutian Islands, this term is a geologic grouping rather than a geographic one, and the Aleutian Arc extends through the Alaska Peninsula following the Aleutian Range to the Aleutian Islands. - A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as . - Attu is the westernmost and largest island in the Near Islands group of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, and the westernmost point of land relative to Alaska, the United States, North America and the Americas. The island became uninhabited in 2010. - Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. Fishing may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock. - Dacite is an igneous, volcanic rock. It has an aphanitic to porphyritic texture and is intermediate in composition between andesite and rhyolite. The word dacite comes from Dacia, a province of the Roman Empire which lay between the Danube River and Carpathian Mountains (now modern Romania and Moldova) where the rock was first described.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the city that was bombed in the Bristol Blitz? is inside the article: Bristol, the largest city in South West England, has an eclectic combination of architectural styles, ranging from the medieval to 20th century brutalism and beyond. During the mid-19th century, Bristol Byzantine, an architectural style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived. Buildings from most of the architectural periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era, as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants. Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several Georgian-era squares were laid out for the enjoyment of the middle class. As the city grew, it merged with its surrounding villages, each with its own character and centre, often clustered around a parish church. The construction of the city's Floating Harbour, taking in the wharves on the River Avon and Frome, provided a focus for industrial development and the growth of the local transport infrastructure. Key elements of which include the Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed Clifton Suspension Bridge and Temple Meads terminus; the latter served from 2002 to 2009 as the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, but is now closed.The 20th century saw further expansion of the city, the growth of the University of Bristol and the arrival of the aircraft industry. During World War II, the city centre was extensively bombed in the Bristol Blitz. The redevelopment of shopping centres, office buildings, and the harbourside continues to this day., can you guess it ?

First, analyze the tweet: \\"@trvsbrkr Bama can spell better than I can lol Im sooo jealous....\\" 2. Identify key elements: - \\"@trvsbrkr\\" is a Twitter handle (username) - \\"Bama\\" is likely a nickname or short for someone's name, not related to sentiment - \\"can spell better than I can\\" is a comparison between the author and Bama, slightly self-deprecating - \\"lol\\" suggests humor or amusement - \\"Im sooo jealous...\\" shows mild envy, though it should be noted that the elongated \\"sooo\\" might also suggest a playful tone 3. Assess the overall sentiment: - The user is amused (evident by \\"lol\\") and playfully expressing a mild envy (through \\"Im sooo jealous...\\") at someone's spelling ability. 4. Justify the conclusion: - The use of casual internet slang and playful exaggeration implies that the negative sentiment (i.e., jealousy) is not very strong, and the author might be making a lighthearted or teasing comment.

Objective: Established preclinical disease models are essential for not only studying aetiology and/or pathophysiology of the relevant diseases but more importantly also for testing prevention and/or treatment concept(s). The present study proposed and established a detailed induction and assessment protocol for a unique and cost-effective preclinical steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) in rats with pulsed injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and methylprednisolone (MPS). Methods: Sixteen 24-week-old male SpragueeDawley rats were used to induce SAON by one intravenous injection of LPS (0.2 mg/kg) and three intraperitoneal injections of MPS (100 mg/kg) with a time interval of 24 hour, and then, MPS (40 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected three times a week from week 2 until sacrifice. Additional 12 rats were used as normal controls. Two and six weeks after induction, animals were scanned by metabolic dual energy Xray absorptiometry for evaluation of tissue composition; serum was collected for bone turnover markers, Microfil perfusion was performed for angiography, the liver was collected for histopathology and bilateral femora and bilateral tibiae were collected for histological examination. Results: Three rats died after LPS injection, i.e., with 15.8% (3/19) mortality. Histological evaluation showed 100% incidence of SAON at week 2. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry showed significantly higher fat percent and lower lean mass in SAON group at week 6. Micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) showed significant bone degradation at proximal tibia 6 weeks after SAON induction. Angiography illustrated significantly less blood vessels in the Journal of Orthopaedic Translation (2018) 13, 13e24 proximal tibia and significantly more leakage particles in the distal tibia 2 weeks after SAON induction. Serum amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen and osteocalcin were significantly lower at both 2 and 6 weeks after SAON induction, and serum carboxy-terminal telopeptide was significantly lower at 6 weeks after SAON induction. Histomorphometry revealed significantly lower osteoblast surface and higher marrow fat fraction and oedema area in SAON group. Hepatic oedema appeared 2 weeks after SAON induction, and lipid accumulation appeared in the liver of SAON rats 6 weeks after SAON induction. Conclusion: The present study successfully induced SAON in rats with pulsed injection of LPS and MPS, which was well simulating the clinical feature and pathology. Apart from available large animal models, such as bipedal emus or quadrupedal rabbits, our current SAON small model in rats could be a cost-effective preclinical experimental model to study body metabolism, molecular mechanism of SAON and potential drugs developed for prevention or treatment of SAON. The translational potential of this article: The present study successfully induced SAON in a small animal model in rats with pulsed injection of LPS and MPS. The evaluation protocols with typical histopathologic ON features and advanced evaluation approaches to identify the metabolic disorders of SAON could be used in future rat SAON studies. The SAON rat model is a suitable and cost-effective animal model to study molecular mechanism of SAON and potential drugs developed for prevention and treatment of SAON.

Article: Carbon monoxide poisoning causes death and injuries around the world. This gas is a problem in all parts of the world that experience cold weather. A few years ago, America's Centers for Disease Control (C. D. C.) studied deaths linked with carbon monoxide poisoning. It found that the number of carbon monoxide deaths in the United States was greatest in January. The C.D.C. also found that carbon monoxide kills more than four hundred Americans each year. And, it said more than twenty thousand people are taken to hospital for treatment of health problems linked with the gas. Carbon monoxide is called the silent killer because people do not know it is in the air. The gas has no color, no taste and no smell. It does not cause burning eyes. And it does not cause people to cough. Yet, carbon monoxide gas is very deadly . It steals the body's ability to use oxygen. Carbon monoxide makes it difficult for the blood to carry oxygen to body tissues . It does this by linking with the blood. When the gas links with the blood, the blood is no longer able to carry oxygen to the tissues that need it. Damage to the body can begin very quickly from large amounts of carbon monoxide. How quickly this can happen depend on how long a person is breathing the gas and how much gas he or she breathes in. Carbon monoxide poisoning has warning signs . But people have to be awake to realize them. Small amounts of the gas will cause a person's head to hurt. He or she may begin to feel tired. Their stomachs may feel sick. The room may appear to be turning around. The person may have trouble thinking clearly. People develop serious headache as the amount of the gas continues to enter their blood. They will begin to feel very tired and sleepy. They may have terrible stomachache. Doctors say carbon monoxide influences people differently. For example a small child will experience health problems or die much sooner than an adult. The general health of the person or his or her age can also be important. Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? - Carbon monoxide poisoning seldom happens in cold areas. - Twenty thousand Americans are killed by carbon monoxide each year. - Most people know whether there is carbon monoxide in the air. - Carbon monoxide stops the blood from carrying oxygen to body tissues.

Wladyslaw Gomulka (Polish: [vwa'diswaf go'muwka]; 6 February 1905 - 1 September 1982) was a Polish communist politician. He was the de facto leader of post-war Poland until 1948. Following the Polish October he became leader again from 1956 to 1970. Gomulka was initially very popular for his reforms; his seeking a \\"Polish way to socialism\\"; and giving rise to the period known as \\"Gomulka's thaw\\". Wladyslaw Gomulka was born on 6 February 1905 in Bialobrzegi Franciszkanskie village on the outskirts of Krosno, into a worker's family living in the Austrian Partition (the Galicia region). His parents had met and married in the United States, where each had emigrated in search of work in the late 19th century, but returned to occupied Poland in the early 20th century because Wladyslaw's father Jan was unable to find gainful employment in America. Jan Gomulka then worked as a laborer in the Subcarpathian oil industry. Wladyslaw's older sister Jozefa, born in the US, returned there upon turning eighteen to join her extended family, most of whom had emigrated, and to preserve her US citizenship. Wladyslaw and his two other siblings experienced a childhood of the proverbial Galician poverty: they lived in a dilapidated hut and ate mostly potatoes. Wladyslaw received only rudimentary education before being employed in the oil industry of the region. Gomulka attended schools in Krosno for six or seven years, until the age of thirteen, when he had to start an apprenticeship in a metalworks shop. Throughout his life Gomulka was an avid reader and accomplished a great deal of self-education, but remained a subject of jokes because of his lack of formal education and demeanor. In 1922, Gomulka passed his apprenticeship exams and began working at a local refinery. The re-established Polish state of Gomulka's teen years was a scene of growing political polarization and radicalization. The young worker developed connections with the radical Left, joining the Sila (Power) youth organization in 1922 and the Independent Peasant Party in 1925. Gomulka was known for his activism in the metal workers and, from 1922, chemical industry unions. He was involved in union-organized strikes and in 1924, during a protest gathering in Krosno, participated in a polemical debate with Herman Lieberman. He published radical texts in leftist newspapers. In May 1926 the young Gomulka was for the first time arrested, but soon released because of worker demands. The incident was the subject of a parliamentary intervention by the Peasant Party. In October 1926, Gomulka became a secretary of the managing council in the Chemical Industry Workers Union for the Drohobych District and remained involved with that communist-dominated union until 1930. He around this time learned on his own basic Ukrainian. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Where was he born?","completion":"Wladyslaw Gomulka was born on 6 February 1905 in Bialobrzegi Franciszkanskie village on the outskirts of Krosno, in the Austrian Partition (the Galicia region).

On Wednesday, her mother Deborah told jurors Georgina Symonds - who was paid up to £10,000-a-month to be his personal escort - knew everything about him and \\"thought she could ruin him\\". The court has previously heard how Mr Morgan lavished Georgina Symonds, from the Allt-yr-yn area of Newport, with expensive gifts including helicopter rides and spa days. He planted a listening device disguised as a white plug socket in a bungalow he owned in Llanmartin, Newport, where he allowed the mother-of-one to live rent-free. He overheard Georgina Symonds tell her new boyfriend Tom Ballinger she planned to leave married Mr Morgan and blackmail him. On Wednesday, her mother told the court she threatened to tell his family how she had met him and had a photograph with him and another escort in his marital home, Beech Hill Farm in Usk. Deborah Symonds said: \\"She threatened to tell everyone about them and thought she could ruin him. \\"She said, 'I know Peter Morgan keeps about £50,000 at home and I'm going to do this warts and all. \\"'He is hiding from the taxman and he has also built property that hasn't met building regulations'.\\" Mr Morgan had promised to sign over the bungalow Georgina Symonds was living in at Pencoed Castle, the court heard, and he had taken out a life insurance policy for £1m which she would receive if he died. Deborah Symonds, a residential services officer, also said her daughter wanted to hurt Mr Morgan following the death of her ex-boyfriend in November 2015, so he would feel pain like she did.

Fact 2: Thus swimming is defined as a special kind of moving, namely moving in or through water. Given the two facts above, a long tail can be used for _ by an animal? The answer is:","completion":"Given the two facts above, a long tail can be used for swimming by an animal. A long tail can serve several vital functions for animals, one of which is enhancing their mobility in the water. These tails come in different shapes and sizes, depending on the species and their specific needs, but they generally act as a propeller or a rudder, enabling animals to move effectively and efficiently through the water. Swimming is a mode of locomotion that enables animals to move through water by generating thrust and maneuvering their bodies. This is distinct from other forms of motion, such as walking or flying, where the animals typically use their limbs or wings to generate lift, balance, and directional control. In water, animals face different challenges because it is a denser and more viscous medium compared to air, and thus they need specialized adaptations to overcome these challenges and function optimally. A long tail is particularly useful for swimming due to several reasons: 1. Propulsion: The tail can create forward thrust by moving it from side to side or in an undulating manner, propelling the animal through the water. Examples of this can be seen in fish and marine mammals like dolphins and whales, where their tails generate most of the propulsive force that moves them through the water. 2. Stability and Maneuverability: A long tail can act as a stabilizer or a rudder, allowing animals to maintain balance, change direction, and performs various acrobatic moves in the water. For instance, crocodiles use their powerful, long tails to help them navigate swiftly in water, while newts and salamanders use their tails for balance and precise movements. 3. Energy Efficiency: A long tail can allow animals to be more energy-efficient when moving through water, as it may generate more thrust by using its length and surface area, minimizing drag, and facilitating smooth movement. This attribute helps animals reduce the effort required to swim, enabling them to cover greater distances or forage for longer periods underwater. 4. Adaptations for Habitat and Lifestyle: For some animals, having a long tail for swimming is essential for survival, as their habitats and lifestyle require them to move through water regularly. For example, the long tail plays a crucial role for semiaquatic mammals like beavers and otters, as they rely on their tails for propulsion and steering while foraging for food and escaping from predators. In conclusion, the answer to the given question is that a long tail can be used for swimming by an animal. A long tail serves various functions, including providing propulsion, stability, and maneuverability, offering energy efficiency, and aiding in adaptations for specific habitats and lifestyles. These characteristics make it an essential evolutionary adaptation for many animals that inhabit aquatic or semiaquatic environments."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Having both parties sign the contract demonstrates their agreement with the terms and their commitment to fulfilling their respective obligations. Option (a) is incorrect because simply having one party sign the contract does not create a legally binding agreement.

Article: Listening to music can help me focus better. Since I discovered it two years ago,I've used music to get through boring work or to focus creatively. I've found that it can make even the dullest jobs enjoyable and help clear mental blocks to creativity. I first noticed the good effects of music while playing video games. It was a few days before Christmas in 2005 and I was playing online video games. My parents had just given me a new MP3,so I decided to listen to music through the headphones while I played. After a few minutes I noticed a great change in my style of play. I was playing more naturally. The music relaxed me,and,to a certain extent,distracted me from the game,allowing my subconscious talent to come through. The music also helped me block out the outside world. With those headphones on I was like a machine,moving from one task to the next without unnecessary thoughts or actions. Music can also have a great effect on mood. If I'm in a bad mood at work,I'll listen to some of Bob Marley's and get down to business. It always takes my mind off what I'm doing and makes me a happier person. The same is true for classic rock. One summer,I did a boring job collecting bottle openers by hand. Without a radio playing classic rock in the background,I would have hated life.

Q:Information: - The Battle of Midway was a decisive naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II. Between 4 and 7 June 1942, only six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea, the United States Navy under Admirals Chester Nimitz, Frank Jack Fletcher, and Raymond A. Spruance decisively defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto, Chuichi Nagumo, and Nobutake Kondo near Midway Atoll, inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable. Military historian John Keegan called it \\"the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare.\\" - Yamamoto held several important posts in the Imperial Japanese Navy, and undertook many of its changes and reorganizations, especially its development of naval aviation. He was the commander-in-chief during the decisive early years of the Pacific War and so was responsible for major battles such as Pearl Harbor and Midway. He died when American codebreakers identified his flight plans and his plane was shot down. His death was a major blow to Japanese military morale during World War II. - Midway Atoll (also called Midway Island and Midway Islands; Hawaiian: \\"Pihemanu Kauihelani\\") is a atoll in the North Pacific Ocean at . As its name suggests, Midway is roughly equidistant between North America and Asia. Midway Atoll is an unorganized, unincorporated territory of the United States. Midway continues to be the only island in the Hawaiian archipelago that is not part of the state of Hawaii. Unlike the other Hawaiian islands, Midway observes Samoa Time (i.e., eleven hours behind Coordinated Universal Time), which is one hour behind the time in the state of Hawaii. For statistical purposes, Midway is grouped as one of the United States Minor Outlying Islands. The Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, encompassing of land and water (mostly water) in the surrounding area, is administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The refuge and most of its surrounding area are part of the larger Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument. - The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the country's seven uniformed services. The Coast Guard is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission (with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters) and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set. It operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, and can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy by the U.S. President at any time, or by the U.S. Congress during times of war. This has happened twice, in 1917, during World War I, and in 1941, during World War II. - The Battle of the Coral Sea, fought during 48 May 1942, was a major naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II between the Imperial Japanese Navy and naval and air forces from the United States and Australia. The battle was the first action in which aircraft carriers engaged each other, as well as the first in which neither side's ships sighted or fired directly upon the other. - The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN; Kyjitai: Shinjitai: \\"\\" or \\"Nippon Kaigun\\", \\"Navy of the Greater Japanese Empire\\") was the navy of the Empire of Japan from 1868 until 1945, when it was dissolved following Japan's defeat and surrender in World War II. It was controlled by the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff and the Ministry of the Navy, both of which were nominally subordinate to the Emperor of Japan as supreme commander of the army and the navy. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) was formed after the dissolution of the IJN. - The attack on Pearl Harbor, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor, the Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, and Operation Z during planning, was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack led to the United States' entry into World War II. - Pearl Harbor is a lagoon harbor on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, west of Honolulu. Much of the harbor and surrounding lands is a United States Navy deep-water naval base. It is also the headquarters of the United States Pacific Fleet. The U.S. government first obtained exclusive use of the inlet and the right to maintain a repair and coaling station for ships here in 1887. The attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan on December 7, 1941 was the immediate cause of the United States' entry into World War II. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: – It's being described as a landmark decision in favor of privacy: The Supreme Court ruled Friday that the government in most cases needs a warrant to track a person's location by grabbing data from cellphone towers. Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four liberal-leaning justices and wrote the majority opinion, though he added that warrants can be skipped in emergency situations to avert an imminent threat, reports USA Today. The case stems from a series of armed robberies in Michigan and Ohio in 2010 and 2011. Under the Stored Communications Act of 1986, the government obtained cellphone records for suspect Timothy Carpenter that revealed 12,898 location points over 127 days, reports CNET. He was later sentenced to 116 years in prison, per the Guardian. Friday's ruling says obtaining an \\"all-encompassing record\\" of a person's whereabouts without a warrant is a form of unreasonable search and seizure. \\"The Government's position fails to contend with the seismic shifts in digital technology that made possible the tracking of not only Carpenter's location but also everyone else's, not for a short period but for years and years,\\" Roberts writes, noting that people \\"compulsively carry cell phones with them all the time.\\" In a rare move, all four dissenting justices wrote their own opinions. For example, Samuel Alito said the ruling \\"guarantees a blizzard of litigation while threatening many legitimate and valuable investigative practices upon which law enforcement has rightfully come to rely.\\"","completion":"Landmark Supreme Court Ruling on Privacy and Cellphone Tracking Data In a landmark decision that is being hailed as a victory for privacy rights, the United States Supreme Court ruled that in most cases, the government requires a warrant to track a person's location by acquiring data from cellphone towers. This ruling is expected to have a significant impact on the balance between privacy and security in the digital age. The case under review involved Timothy Carpenter, who was sentenced to 116 years in prison following a string of armed robberies in Michigan and Ohio between 2010 and 2011. As part of the investigation, the government obtained Carpenter's cellphone records under the Stored Communications Act of 1986, revealing 12,898 location points over 127 days. According to Friday's ruling, obtaining such comprehensive records of a person's whereabouts without a warrant is a form of unreasonable search and seizure. Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court's four liberal-leaning judges and penned the majority opinion. While he acknowledged that there may be circumstances in which warrants can be skipped to prevent imminent threats, he argued that the government's position fails to take into account the substantial advancements in digital technology which enable the tracking of not only Carpenter's location but also that of everyone else, for extended periods. Roberts noted that many people \\"compulsively carry cell phones with them all the time,\\" and posited that tracking their location without a warrant is an invasion of privacy. This point of view reflects the growing concern among privacy advocates that the current digital landscape offers opportunities for excessive surveillance, with potentially negative consequences for civil liberties. In a rare move, all four dissenting justices wrote their own opinions on the ruling. Justice Samuel Alito, for example, argued that the decision \\"guarantees a blizzard of litigation while threatening many legitimate and valuable investigative practices upon which law enforcement has rightfully come to rely.\\" This perspective is shared by many in the law enforcement community who believe that the ruling may impede their ability to investigate cases and bring perpetrators to justice. This new ruling is expected to spark debate on how to strike the right balance between protecting privacy and ensuring security in a world where technology continues to evolve rapidly. It remains to be seen how this shift in judicial thinking might influence other technology-focused legislation and court rulings in the future. In summary, the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision favoring privacy marks a significant turning point in the ongoing debate between privacy rights and security concerns, especially in the digital age. As technology continues to rapidly advance, it is crucial that the legal system adapts and provides appropriate protections for citizens' privacy, while still enabling the pursuit of justice. This ruling is a clear indication that the highest court in the land acknowledges the importance of reevaluating the balance between these two crucial aspects of modern life."},{"prompt":"In this task you will be given an answer to a question.

How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? @neillavin300 I did lol we had it on a cd before eurovision ended, now that is sad. Fairytale -- Alexander Rybak.","completion":"To describe the sentiment of this tweet, it is essential to break down its various components and context. The tweet consists of a user mentioning another user, along with comments about a particular song, \\"Fairytale,\\" by Alexander Rybak. The song in question became well-known after winning the Eurovision Song Contest in 2009. In general, the sentiment of this tweet is mixed, with both positive and negative aspects. The tweet can be dissected into different observations and feelings being expressed by the user like nostalgia, amusement, and a slight tinge of self-deprecation or embarrassment. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the tweet: 1. Nostalgia: The user mentions \\"we had it on a cd before eurovision ended.\\" This statement can be interpreted as a fond remembrance of listening to the song in the past and enjoying it before it even became popular. The sentiment here leans towards positive, as they imply that they liked the song enough to have it in their collection at that time. 2. Amusement: The user writes, \\"I did lol.\\" The abbreviation \\"lol\\" (laugh out loud) indicates that the user is amused or entertained by the experience of having listened to the song before it became well-known. This expression adds a light-hearted tone to the tweet, suggesting that the user is sharing a funny experience or story. 3. Self-deprecation/Embarrassment: The phrase \\"now that is sad\\" seems to allude to the idea that being such an early adopter of the song might be considered a bit ridiculous, or \\"sad.\\" The user appears to be poking fun at themselves or expressing mild embarrassment for having been so invested in the song at that time. This part of the sentiment can be characterized as negative, as it involves a critique of the user's own enthusiasm. 4. Appreciation for the song: Mentioning the song title \\"Fairytale\\" and the artist \\"Alexander Rybak\\" shows that the user appreciates and acknowledges the song and the artist, holding them in high regard. This aspect of the tweet is positive, as it demonstrates that the user is a fan of the song and the artist. Thus, the overall sentiment of the tweet is a blend of various emotions, with nostalgic undertones, amusement, appreciation for the song, and a hint of self-deprecation. The tone is primarily light-hearted and conversational, as the user shares a memory and personal reaction to the song and its origins in their life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. If you’re new to doing a 180 on your skateboard or haven’t done the trick in a while it’s a good idea to get your body used to being in the proper position. Practice skating around for a bit by pushing off and then situating your body into the right position. The ollie is the most fundamental skateboard trick and it’s incorporated into pretty much every trick you’ll do. And the 180 is an ollie where you turn your board and body 180-degrees. For the 180 you’ll be turning around either behind you for a backside 180, or in front of you for a frontside 180. Once you have the ollie down, you’re well on your way to doing a 180 skateboard trick! If you ride “regular” you will have your right foot in the back positioned on the tail of the board. If you ride “goofy” then your left foot will be in back on the tail. You want to position your back foot on the tip of the tail. To do a 180 on the skateboard, you’ll want to position your back foot on the corner of the tail. For a straight ollie your front foot will be centered about halfway up the board or slightly back. You also want to put more pressure on the outer edge of your foot (the side your pinky toe is on). To help you with turning, plant your front foot so its slightly hanging over the opposite edge of board from your back foot. This may feel awkward but it will help to keep your board balanced when you’re in the air. Your shoulders and your upper body is where most of the work will come from when you perform your 180. By setting your shoulders correctly you will be able to turn your body quickly enough and this should allow your legs and the board to follow. You might be tempted to try and force the board to turn using mostly your legs, but you won’t get enough torque this way. For a backside 180, position your front shoulder slightly in front of your chest and dip it down so when you pull up you have more momentum to work with. For a frontside 180, you want to position back shoulder in front of your chest and dip it down as well so you can pull up and create momentum. You don’t want too much of a bend so that you end up crouching too low as that won’t allow you to pop high enough. You should stand with relaxed knees like you’re getting ready to hop slightly. If you are bending correctly you should be able to slide your front forward up the board with ease.

The case kept opening by itself because of the box kept in it because the","completion":"box seemed to have some sort of powerful magnetic force emanating from it. Curiosity piqued, Alex decided to take a closer look at the peculiar object that had landed in their possession. Step 1: Secure the area. Alex reasoned that, with an unknown object exhibiting such unusual properties, it would be best to make sure there wouldn't be any major disruptions or accidents nearby. They carefully moved any metal objects or electronic devices out of the vicinity to minimize any unwanted interactions. Step 2: Investigate the object. With the area secured, Alex could now examine the box more closely, looking for any markings or symbols that might provide clues to its origin or purpose. They began taking photos of the box from all angles, making sure to capture any symbols or markings that could be important. Step 3: Research the symbols and markings. Alex uploaded the photos to their computer and began an online search for information on any of the symbols they'd found. They combed through historical databases and forums dedicated to arcane knowledge, trying to pinpoint any connections to cultures or time periods that might help reveal the box's true nature. Step 4: Consult an expert. When their initial research did not yield conclusive results, Alex decided to reach out to an expert in the field of ancient mysteries and unusual artifacts – Dr. Helena Vanstone. They sent Dr. Vanstone an email with the photos of the box attached, inquiring whether she had any insights into the mysterious item. Step 5: Awaiting the reply, Alex returned to the box. They observed the magnetic force again, attempting to determine if the box was activated by touch, or if it had any other sort of trigger mechanism. Alex wore gloves to avoid direct contact with the box and used a plastic tool to gently prod the surface to see if it caused any reaction. Step 6: Experiment with materials. Alex thought it useful to know if the box's powerful magnetic force would be negated by certain materials. This could help contain the box and prevent any further unintended effects. They tested different materials as a barrier, such as wood, plastic, and glass, to observe if any of them could diminish the magnetic force. Step 7: Reevaluate the situation. After conducting extensive research and experimenting with the box, Alex still had no concrete explanation for its existence or purpose. They decided to wait for Dr. Vanstone's response before making any decisions on how to proceed. Step 8: The reply from Dr. Vanstone finally arrived. Alex eagerly opened the email, hoping for some answers. Reading through the detailed message, they discovered that the box might have origins in a long-lost civilization known for advanced technology and a powerful magnetic energy source little was known about. Step 9: Collaboration with Dr. Vanstone. Considering the significance of this finding, Alex decided to collaborate with Dr. Vanstone to further investigate the box's properties and origin. They agreed to ship the box to Dr. Vanstone's lab securely, using a non-metallic containment unit to avoid potential accidents during transit. Step 10: Discovery and further research. As Dr. Vanstone's team conducted more tests and analyzed the data provided by Alex, they hoped to unlock the secrets of the mysterious magnetic box. They knew the journey to understanding the true nature of the artifact would be challenging, but with careful study and perseverance, they were confident that they would eventually uncover its secrets, possibly opening doors to an entirely new understanding of history and technologies from a lost civilization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Serpico Context: Frank Serpico (Al Pacino) covered in blood and slumped in the backseat of a police car as it races to a hospital with lights and sirens blaring. He has just been shot in the face. The rest of the movie tells the story of Serpico's career up to this moment, starting with him becoming a police officer in 1960. He is very idealistic and believes in non-brutal methods to catch criminals. Serpico also refuses to join in on police corruption, specifically that which involves shaking down and taking payoffs from gambling and drug dealing organizations. His refusal to take bribes earns him the suspicion of his fellow officers throughout the majority of the precincts to which he is assigned. Additionally, Serpico finds trouble fitting in due to his embrace of the counterculture of the 1960s: He moves to Greenwich Village, grows his hair and beard long to the point where he must maintain a plainclothes appearance, and associates with a more left-wing crowd that is distrusting of the NYPD.At first Serpico tries appealing to his bosses about the corruption, but gets nowhere. He enlists a highly-connected fellow officer, Bob Blair (Tony Roberts) in his fight against corruption, but not even he can crack the city administration's general indifference. His campaign and the resulting complications and harassment within the department take a toll on his mental health and his relationship with fiancee Laurie (Barbara Eda-Young), who ultimately leaves him. After meeting a sympathetic police inspector who agrees to assist him with both disrupting the gambling rackets and later calling attention to the problem by going to the New York Times, he is transferred to narcotics, as he has always wanted. However, he finds himself in an even more corrupt and hostile atmosphere than before, where he has mostly enemies and almost no allies due to the reputation he has garnered. As a result, he is shot in the face during a raid on a heroin lab due to his fellow officers' reluctance to come to his aid. After being left for dead and... The answer to this question is:","completion":"A government inquiry into the NYPD refers to an official investigation conducted by a government agency or legislative body to examine the operations, policies, or corruption within the New York Police Department (NYPD). In the context of the movie Serpico, the protagonist uncovers widespread corruption within the police department and tries to bring it to the attention of his superiors and the city administration. A government inquiry involving the NYPD may involve examining instances of corruption, abuse of power, or similar issues and recommending reforms or actions to address these problems. In Serpico's case, his struggles led to the creation of the Knapp Commission, which was formed to investigate police corruption in New York City in the 1970s."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But also a question for economists, argued Kenneth Boulding, a British economist, in an essay published in 1966. We have run our economies, he warned, like cowboys on the open grassland: taking and using the world's resources, confident that more lies over the horizon. But the Earth is less a grassland than a spaceship--a closed system, alone in space, carrying limited supplies. We need, said Boulding, an economics that takes seriously the idea of environmental limits. In the half century since his essay, a new movement has responded to his challenge. \\"Ecological economists\\", as they call themselves, want to revolutionise its aims and assumptions. What do they say--and will their ideas achieve lift-off? To its advocators, ecological economics is neither ecology nor economics, but a mix of both. Their starting point is to recognise that the human economy is part of the natural world. Our environment, they note, is both a source of resources and a sink for wastes. But it is ignored in conventional textbooks, where neat diagrams trace the flows between firms, households and the government as though nature did not exist. That is a mistake, say ecological economists. There are two ways our economies can grow, ecological economists point out: through technological change, or through more intensive use of resources. Only the former, they say, is worth having. They are suspicious of GDP, a crude measure which does not take account of resource exhaustion, unpaid work, and countless other factors. In its place they advocate moreholistic approaches, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), a composite index that includes things like the cost of pollution, deforestation and car accidents. While GDP has kept growing, global GPI per person peaked in 1978: by destroying our environment we are making ourselves poorer, not richer.

Jake and his son Ryan just had their yearly physical examination by the doctor. As part of this year's examination, both men had their arterial walls examined to identify the presence of plaques. The doctor discovered that Jake had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall. Ryan, on the other hand, had no plaques present. Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle.

Write the answer: \\"Who said \\"\\"the die is cast\\"\\" as he crossed the Rubicon?\\"","completion":"\\"The die is cast\\" is a famous quote attributed to Julius Caesar, a Roman statesman, general, and one of the most well-known historical figures from ancient history. He reportedly said the phrase \\"Alea iacta est\\" (in Latin) as he crossed the Rubicon River, which, at the time, marked the northern boundary of Italy. This event occurred on January 10, 49 B.C. The phrase signifies an irrevocable decision or an action's point of no return. To provide some context, Julius Caesar was born in 100 B.C. into a patrician family. Although from a well-connected background, Caesar faced many challenges in his youth. He steadily rose to prominence through his talents as an orator, general, and politician. During the Gallic Wars from 58 B.C. to 50 B.C., Caesar expanded the Roman territories to include regions like Gaul and Britannia, amassing wealth and power in the process. However, his achievements also earned him adversaries within the ruling establishment in Rome. The First Triumvirate, formed by Julius Caesar, Pompey the Great, and Marcus Licinius Crassus, was an informal alliance that allowed the three men to advance their political aspirations. With Crassus' death in 53 B.C. and the deteriorating personal relationship between Caesar and Pompey, the stage was set for a power struggle between these two prominent figures. The Roman Senate, worried about Caesar's growing influence, ordered him to disband his army and return to Rome. Refusing to comply, Caesar chose to cross the Rubicon River with his legions, initiating a civil war. By crossing the Rubicon River and disobeying the Senate's orders, Caesar committed an act of insubordination and treason that would lead to a series of critical events in the history of Rome. The civil war culminated in the defeat of Pompey's forces, ultimately paving the way for Caesar to become the dictator of Rome. Caesar's reign, though relatively brief, resulted in substantial political, social, and military reforms that shaped the future of the Roman Empire. To sum it up, Julius Caesar, one of ancient Rome's most iconic figures, exclaimed \\"the die is cast\\" as he crossed the Rubicon River—a bold and irreversible decision that altered the course of history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. Paragraph: Dr. Jones studied 2 groups of people to see the effects of aging on humans. Group A had people under 35 years old in it, while group B had people over 65. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group had an increased reflex time? Answer:","completion":"Group B, consisting of individuals over 65 years old, experienced an increased reflex time compared to Group A. This increase in reflex time can be attributed to the various physiological changes that occur in the human body during late adulthood. As an individual grows older, their overall physical fitness, strength, and stamina tend to decline, which can inevitably affect their reflexes. Furthermore, the aging process can impair individuals' sensory faculties, potentially making it more challenging for them to react quickly to stimuli in their environment. These factors, combined with other age-related health risks such as weakened immune systems and the development of diseases like arthritis or Alzheimer's, contribute to the decline in reflex time typically observed in older adults, as seen in Group B of Dr. Jones' study."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They’re under huge pressure to write and publish but an ever-growing mountain of teaching and admin is stopping them doing just that. Our research finds that whilst nobody is immune to these pressures, some academics cope better than others – and that’s because over the years, they’ve developed personal “systems” to help them write. We recently carried out in-depth interviews with 23 scholars across the UK, Europe and the US. We deliberately chose a diverse group so as to not make any assumptions based on age, seniority, or research background. Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts. We did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko – a digital coaching tool for writers. Whilst every academic had developed a writing productivity system personal to them, we found there were six common “habits” that the most prolific (and generally least stressed) academics tended to use. 1. They “time-block” their writing in advance Scheduling – booking in time to write in advance – was the single most common habit of our writers. It didn’t appear to matter what type of time-blocking method a scholar chose to use or how lengthy a writing session was. Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week. What seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing – and so made the process easier and less stressful. “When I need to write I block out time. I’m lucky in that I can work from home – I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand. I couldn’t really write in any other way than blocking out that time.” Researchers found that writers who don't time-block their writing in advance probably: Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - Get all of their work done - Feel like they're stuck - Are more efficient than those that do time-block Answer:","completion":"- Feel like they're stuck"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The guidelines provided to us are that a post would be considered as \\"HISTORICAL\\" if the author has already performed the actions and \\"HYPOTHETICAL\\" if the author is contemplating doing something in the future. Given the post, the author is recalling past events where her husband scrapes his teeth on utensils while eating, which triggers her misophonia, a heightened sensitivity to noises developed due to traumatic brain injuries she suffered a few years ago. She also mentions her actions of removing herself from the room when he's eating or politely asking him not to scrape his teeth on utensils. Therefore, the actions and events mentioned in the post have already occurred, which aligns with the definition of a \\"HISTORICAL\\" post.

Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas.

Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government. Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Who designed geometric bowls and bronze vessels?\\" is \\"Homosapiens\\"? 1. no 2. yes","completion":"The correct answer is 1. No. According to the passage, the geometric bowls and bronze vessels were designed by the Chinese during the Shang Dynasty, not by Homo sapiens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The president rode bikes with his family for a little less than an hour before breaking off to go play golf. Sasha did not accompany her family to. Martha's Vineyard when they left Washington, D.C. last Saturday. The. White House has said she'll be joining her family for part of their. two-week summer vacation, but she has yet to be seen. Reporters traveling with first family on vacation said the president spent just under half an hour biking with his wife and daughter before breaking away to hit the links. Obama is playing his fifth game of golf today since arriving on the island. He was joined today by 32 Advisors Founder and CEO Robert Wolf. Wolf is a hedge fund and money manager who served on Obama's now-defunct Jobs Council. Today was the first time that the Obamas, sans Sasha, have been seen hanging out together since the start of their 15 day vacation. President Obama rode a black and blue bike and sported a black Nike athletic shirt, dark gray pants and black Nike tennis shoes.

John William Carson (October 23, 1925 - January 23, 2005) was an American television host, comedian, writer, and producer. He is best known as the host of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962-1992). Carson received six Emmy Awards, the Television Academy's 1980 Governor's Award, and a 1985 Peabody Award. He was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1987. On May 1, 1972, the show was moved from Thirty Rockefeller Plaza, New York, to Burbank, California, because of the studio's proximity to the celebrities. Carson often joked about \\"beautiful downtown Burbank\\" and referred to \\"beautiful downtown Bakersfield\\", which prompted Bakersfield Mayor Mary K. Shell to chide Carson and invite him to her city to see improvements made during the early 1980s. From July 1971, Carson stopped hosting five shows per week. Instead, Mondays featured a guest host, leaving Carson to host the other four weeknights. Shows were videotaped in Burbank at 5:30 pm, fed from there to the Central and Eastern time zone stations via cross-country television line at 8:30 pm Pacific time (11:30 pm Eastern time), and later sent from Burbank to the Pacific time zone stations at 11:30 pm Pacific time. Since only two feeds originated from Burbank, Central time zone stations received the Eastern feed one hour earlier at 10:30 pm local time, and Mountain time stations received the Pacific time zone feed one hour later at 12:30 am local time. In 1980, at Carson's request, the show cut its 90-minute format to 60 minutes on September 16; Tom Snyder's Tomorrow added a half-hour to fill the vacant time. Joan Rivers became the \\"permanent\\" guest host from September 1983 until 1986. The Tonight Show returned to using rotating guest hosts, including comic George Carlin. Jay Leno then became the exclusive guest host in fall 1987. Leno joked that although other guest hosts had upped their fees, he had kept his low, assuring himself more bookings. Eventually, Monday night was for Leno, Tuesday for The Best of Carson--rebroadcasts usually dating from a year earlier, but occasionally from the 1970s. Although Carson's work schedule became more attenuated, Tonight remained so successful that his compensation from NBC continued to rise; by the mid-1970s, he had become the highest-paid personality on television, earning about 4 million a year (15,008,000 today), not including nightclub appearances and his other businesses. He refused many offers to appear in films, including title roles in The Thomas Crown Affair and Gene Wilder's role in Blazing Saddles. He also declined director Martin Scorsese's offer to co-star with Robert De Niro in the 1983 film The King of Comedy, the role of a TV talk-show host then going to Jerry Lewis. In recognition of his 25th anniversary on The Tonight Show, Carson received a personal Peabody Award, the board saying he had \\"become an American institution, a household word, [and] the most widely quoted American.\\" They also said they \\"felt the time had come to recognize the contributions that Johnny has made to television, to humor, and to America.\\"","completion":"This text is about John William Carson, an American television host, comedian, writer, and producer who is best known as the host of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Digimon Digimon hatch from types of eggs which are called Digi-Eggs (デジタマ, Dejitama?). In the English iterations of the franchise there is another type of Digi-Egg that can be used to digivolve, or transform, Digimon. This second type of Digi-Egg is called a Digimental (デジメンタル, Dejimentaru?) in Japanese. (This type of Digi-Egg was also featured as a major object throughout season 2 as a way of Digivolution available only to certain characters at certain points throughout the season.) They age via a process called \\"Digivolution\\" which changes their appearance and increases their powers. The effect of Digivolution, however, is not permanent in the partner Digimon of the main characters in the anime, and Digimon who have digivolved will most of the time revert to their previous form after a battle or if they are too weak to continue. Some Digimon act feral. Most, however, are capable of intelligence and human speech. They are able to digivolve by the use of Digivices that their human partners have. In some cases, as in the first series, the DigiDestined (known as the 'Chosen Children' in the original Japanese) had to find some special items such as crests and tags so the Digimon could digivolve into further stages of evolution known as Ultimate and Mega in the dub. Q: What effect does digivolution have on digimon?","completion":"Digivolution (デジボルション, Dejiborushon), also known as \\"Digital Evolution\\" or \\"Digivolve,\\" is a core process in the Digimon world, which allows Digimon to change their appearance, increase their powers, and enhance their abilities. This transformative process is crucial for Digimon to adapt, grow, and compete in the Digital World. It is important to note that the effects of digivolution are not permanent, and upon completing a battle or when a Digimon becomes too weak, they often revert to their previous form. However, the experiences and growth they gain during their evolved state contribute to their overall development. When a Digimon digivolves, several changes occur: 1. Appearance: The most noticeable change is in the Digimon's physical appearance, as they transform into a new form that represents their next stage of development. This can include alterations in size, color, shape, and the presence of additional limbs or other features. 2. Power Level: As Digimon digivolve, their power levels increase, which makes them stronger, faster, and more resilient. This improved performance enables them to take on more formidable opponents and overcome greater challenges in the Digital World. 3. Abilities and Attacks: With digivolution comes the acquisition of new abilities and attacks, which serve to expand a Digimon's arsenal and give them more strategies to use in battle. These new abilities may include elemental powers, enhanced senses, or healing skills, among other things. 4. Intelligence and Communication Skills: Most Digimon are capable of intelligence and human speech, allowing them to communicate with their human partners and display a wide range of emotions. As a Digimon digivolves, their cognitive abilities may also develop further, enabling them to think more strategically in battle and interact more deeply with their human partners. 5. Affinity to Human Partners: Digivolution is often made possible through the strong bond between a Digimon and its human partner, facilitated by a device called a Digivice. As the Digimon digivolves, their connection with their human partner may continue to intensify, which can unlock additional forms and powers exclusive to that partnership. In conclusion, digivolution is a transformative process that allows Digimon to adapt to challenges, enhance their powers and abilities, and strengthen their bonds with their human partners. While the effects of digivolution are not permanent, the experience and growth gained during their evolved state contribute to the overall development of the Digimon."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This will minimize the severity of the stain it leaves behind. Work from the outside of the spot inward, folding the paper towel periodically to make sure you’re using a clean section. Don’t wipe or scrub the spot, as this will only spread the paint around and enlarge the stain. An absorbent towel will work even better for soaking up the wet paint. Dig out an old one, however, because it will likely be permanently stained afterwards. Add a few drops of a mild liquid dish soap to a container of warm water and stir. For best results, use a standard detergent or even hand soap—anything stronger may damage the leather. Avoid soaps and detergents that are advertised as “extra strength” or contain “grease-fighting” agents. These typically contain harsh additives that can strip the color the color from dyed leather and cause cracking or splitting. Soap and water will be useful for cleaning most water-based paints, including interior color and arts and crafts paint. Dip the brush into the soap solution, then shake off the excess water. Wet the paint spot and begin scrubbing it gently. After a few minutes, wipe the area with a clean towel and resume scrubbing. Repeat until the stain has been removed completely. An old toothbrush or nylon dish scrubber will work well for this purpose. Use just enough force to coax out the stain. Otherwise, you may leave noticeable scratches or scuffs. Since leather is a natural material, it’s especially susceptible to water damage. You’ll want to make sure that you’ve dried the surface thoroughly once the paint is all gone. If you don’t, the residual moisture can cause the leather to crack, split or blister. To dry leather safely and effectively, pat it with a microfiber towel or soft kitchen sponge. Consider treating the surface with a specialty conditioner. A good leather conditioner will enhance the color and texture of leather items while protecting them from spills and other accidents in the future.","completion":"This article is about how to safely remove wet paint from leather by carefully soaking it up, gently scrubbing it with mild soap and water, then drying and conditioning the leather to prevent damage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Deep Peace was just what my body was craving! I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift.

Cassini #39;s First Titan Flyby Tomorrow Summary - (Oct 25, 2004) NASA #39;s Cassini spacecraft will make its first close approach tomorrow to Titan, Saturn #39;s largest moon. Which topic is this article about? Pick your answer from: (A). World; (B). Sports; (C). Business; (D). Science/Tech;","completion":"The given article summary falls under the category of (D). Science/Tech. This article is about NASA's Cassini spacecraft making its first close approach to Titan, Saturn's largest moon, on October 25, 2004. To provide more detailed information, the Cassini mission is a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Italian Space Agency (ASI). Launched on October 15, 1997, the Cassini spacecraft, along with the Huygens probe, was sent to explore Saturn, its rings, and its myriad of moons. The mission is named in honor of the Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, who made numerous pioneering discoveries related to the Saturn system in the 17th century. The first close flyby of Titan by Cassini occurred on October 26, 2004, around three months after the spacecraft entered Saturn's orbit on July 1, 2004. Titan, with a diameter of about 5150 kilometers, is the second-largest moon in our solar system and is even larger than the planet Mercury. It has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen and methane, with clouds of complex organic molecules and a possibility of a subsurface liquid water ocean. One of the main objectives of the Cassini mission was to study Titan's atmosphere, surface, and potential for supporting life. The flyby allowed the spacecraft to capture high-resolution images and gather data on the moon's atmospheric composition, weather patterns, and geological features. A few weeks after the initial flyby, on December 25, 2004, the Huygens probe separated from the Cassini orbiter and landed on Titan's surface on January 14, 2005, marking the first-ever landing on a moon in the outer solar system. Throughout its mission, Cassini conducted more than 120 flybys of Titan, providing invaluable information about this enigmatic moon and its potential to harbor life. The Cassini mission came to an end on September 15, 2017, when the spacecraft was deliberately plunged into Saturn's atmosphere, ending its two-decade-long journey and avoiding any potential contamination of the planet's moons. The mission revolutionized our understanding of the Saturnian system, leaving behind a rich scientific legacy that will continue to impact space exploration and research for decades to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Before settling on their current name in January 1984, the band performed under the name Death Cult, which was an evolution of the name of lead singer Ian Astbury's previous band Southern Death Cult. They gained a dedicated following in the UK in the mid-1980s as a post-punk/gothic rock band, with singles such as \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\", before breaking mainstream in the United States in the late 1980s as a hard rock band with singles such as \\"Love Removal Machine\\" and \\"Fire Woman\\". According to music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the band fuse a \\"heavy metal revivalist\\" sound with the \\"pseudo-mysticism ... of The Doors [and] the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin ... while adding touches of post-punk goth rock\\". Context: With the same line-up still in place, the band released The Cult in October 1994, produced by Bob Rock. The self-titled 'Cult' album is commonly referred to as the 'Black Sheep' album by fans of the group. Astbury referred to the record as \\"very personal and very revealing\\" songs about his life, with the subject matter ranging from sexual abuse at the age of 15, to the death of Nigel Preston, to his directionless years spent in Glasgow in the late 1970s. The record achieved little success, only reaching No. 69 in the US and No. 21 in the UK. Duffy remarked that he thought that the record wouldn't sell well due to the offensive lyrics. The record went to number one in Portugal also, but quickly dropped out of sight. The single \\"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\\" was released with the band going on tour in support of the new album. Only one more single, \\"Star\\", was officially released with a live appearance on UK TV show The Word. \\"Star\\" began life in 1986 as \\"Tom Petty\\" and was recorded at the \\"Sonic Temple\\" demo sessions as \\"Starchild\\", being dropped by the band during rehearsals. In 1993 the song was resurrected and was finally completed for the record in 1994 as, just simply, \\"Star\\". When the band began the Beauty's On The Streets tour in winter 1994, they augmented the line up with James Stevenson on rhythm guitar. As with the Ceremony record several years earlier, no other official singles were released, but several other songs were released on a strictly limited basis: \\"Sacred Life\\" was released in Spain and the Netherlands, \\"Be Free\\" was issued in Canada and France, \\"Saints Are Down\\" was issued in Greece, but none of the songs gained much commercial success. During this tour, the Cult made their first ever appearance in Norway. Question: Did it release world wide?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, the album called \\"The Cult\\" by the British rock band was released worldwide. But it didn't do very well in most places, only reaching number 69 in the US and number 21 in the UK. It did better in Portugal where it reached number 1, but it didn't stay popular for long. They released some singles from the album in different countries but didn't have much success with them either."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The pilot, Roger Peterson, also lost his life in the accident. Their deaths were a significant loss to the early rock 'n' roll world, and the phrase \\"The Day the Music Died\\" was later popularized by Don McLean's 1971 song \\"American Pie.\\" While this devastating event saw the untimely deaths of these three talented artists, several others in their entourage or related to them were not on the plane and survived. Some of the notable people who survived the day the music died include: 1. Waylon Jennings: Jennings was Buddy Holly's bass player and had been touring with him. Originally, he had a seat on the plane but gave it up to J.P. Richardson, who had the flu. This decision ultimately saved his life. Jennings went on to have a successful career as a country music artist. 2. Tommy Allsup: Allsup was a guitarist in Holly's band. He was supposed to be on the plane but, in an impromptu decision, lost his seat to Ritchie Valens in a coin toss. Following the tragedy, Allsup continued his career as a musician and producer. 3. Carl Bunch: The drummer for Holly's band, Bunch was hospitalized at the time with frostbite and thus was not on the plane. He later went on to work as a postal inspector but continued to play music throughout his life. 4. Dion DiMucci: Known as Dion, he was the frontman for \\"Dion and the Belmonts,\\" one of the prominent acts on the Winter Dance Party tour. Dion was offered a seat on the plane but refused due to the cost, which he felt was too expensive. He rose to fame in the 1960s with several solo hits and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. 5. Maria Elena Holly: Buddy Holly's pregnant wife at the time, Maria Elena, was not on the tour at all. After learning about her husband's tragic passing, she suffered a miscarriage due to the psychological trauma. Maria Elena never remarried, dedicating her life to promoting and preserving Buddy Holly's legacy. These individuals may have survived \\"The Day the Music Died,\\" but the impact of that fateful day was felt throughout the music industry and etched the names of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J.P. \\"The Big Bopper\\" Richardson into the annals of rock 'n' roll history."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Find the form that suits what you are going to say. It could be a haiku or even a limerick. Be true, be forthright, and don’t get caught up in other people’s ideas of what being in love is like, or some inherited ideal of a love poem. Concentrate on the realities of the person that you are dealing with. Don’t disguise them as some kind of ideal – they are going to want to feel that’s my poem, that’s my expression, that’s what we did together. Here are my five rules: 1 Speak from your heart. Poets have in their toolbox every trick of rhetoric and linguistic structuring - from alliteration to zeugma. The toolbox is there to be ransacked, but the strength of your feelings might be diverted if you get too tied up with technical stuff. 2 Simply to say “I love you” or “you’re beautiful” is not interesting. Remember William Carlos Williams’ advice about writing - there is no truth but in things. So be particular. Things have a fascination that abstractions don’t. A reader will be more likely to identify with your poem if there are references to personal situations or particular features - be it their body, attitude or behaviour. 3 A sense of humour is not at odds with passionate intensity. Catching the ridiculousness of a situation doesn’t betray the subject or misrepresent the strength of your feelings. And don’t shy away from flaws. The whole business of being attracted to people is connected to their imperfections. 4 Pay attention to rhymes and rhythms and the sound your words make. The sound of the thing is as important as the dictionary definition of the words. 5 Revise, revise, revise. Our first thoughts are almost never our best. What was this article about?","completion":"This article provides advice from poet Andrew Motion on how to write a love poem. He emphasizes the importance of finding a form that matches the message you want to convey and being true to the subject of your affection. Motion shares five rules for writing a love poem: 1. Speak from your heart: While it's essential to use poetic techniques, be careful not to let them distract from the genuine emotion you want to express. 2. Be specific: Avoid generic statements like \\"I love you\\" or \\"you're beautiful.\\" Instead, focus on the unique details of your love or the person that make your feelings special. 3. Embrace humor and flaws: A love poem should encompass the entirety of a relationship, including its imperfections and the humor that comes with it. 4. Consider the auditory aspect: Pay attention to the sound, rhyme, and rhythm of your words, as they can significantly impact how your poem is perceived. 5. Revise, revise, revise: Take time to refine your poem, as our first thoughts are rarely our best. By following these guidelines, you can craft a love poem that truly captures the essence of your feelings and your relationship with your beloved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Police say once they reached Weston, the thieves cut the GPS trackers used to monitor the trailers. “They stole the whole trailer. They’re just…desperate,” said Mike Welsh, owner and operator of Welsh Transport. Welsh unloaded his shipment of poinsettias at the Costco where those Christmas trees were stolen Tuesday night. He says he saw them while they were still outside the store. “When I came here Tuesday and saw them I was like, those things are too easy to disappear,” Welsh told CBS4’s Natalia Zea. He says he didn’t see the trailers secured with a pin-lock designed to keep the trailers from being driven off…cargo and all. Even if they were locked up though, he believes the cargo thieves would have succeeded with their plan. “A lock just going to slow them down, if they knew what they’re doing, they’re desperate, they will take that right off.” Welsh has had one of his trailers stolen in the past and stepped up security measures to guard against holiday time thieves, including 2 pint sized Jack Russell terriers with a ferocious warning bark, and a full camera system all the way around the truck. So far, neither the transporter, Florida Beauty nor Costco have commented to CBS4 on the theft of the hundreds of trees worth a total of 35,000.

In Greek mythology who slayed the Hydra of Lerna?","completion":"In Greek mythology, the Hydra of Lerna, often referred to simply as the Lernaean Hydra or Hydra, was a monstrous serpent-like creature with multiple heads. The exact number of heads varies according to different accounts, but it often ranges from five to nine or even more. The creature was said to have the ability to regenerate its heads when they were severed, with two new heads replacing each head that was cut off. The Hydra was also poisonous, with a deadly venom that could kill humans and animals from a single bite or even from its breath. The slayer of the Hydra of Lerna was the Greek hero Heracles, who is more commonly known by his Roman name Hercules. The feat of killing the Hydra was one of the Twelve Labors that Heracles was ordered to perform by his cousin, King Eurystheus of Tiryns. These tasks were a form of penance and purification for the hero after he was driven mad by the goddess Hera and killed his wife and children in a fit of frenzy. The Twelve Labors were supposed to be impossible tasks, but Heracles managed to complete each one with his incredible strength, resourcefulness, and intelligence. To slay the Hydra, Heracles traveled to the marshes of Lerna, the creature's abode. Upon arriving, Heracles began the battle against the monstrous serpent by attempting to sever its heads using a sickle, club, or sword, depending on the version of the story. However, each time a head was cut off, two new heads would grow back in its place. Frustrated by the monster's seemingly indestructible nature, Heracles sought the help of his nephew Iolaus, who accompanied him on his journey to Lerna. The duo came up with a clever plan to put an end to the Hydra's regenerative abilities. Each time Heracles cut off one of the Hydra's heads, Iolaus used a burning torch, firebrand, or red-hot iron to cauterize the neck wounds, effectively preventing new heads from regrowing. Despite their success with this strategy, Heracles faced other challenges during his battle against the Hydra. According to some accounts, the monster had one immortal head that could not be killed by conventional means. To overcome this obstacle, Heracles severed the immortal head and buried it beneath a heavy rock. In another version of the story, the goddess Hera, who harbored a long-standing grudge against Heracles, sent a giant crab called Carcinus to aid the Hydra in its fight. In response, the hero crushed the crab underfoot and continued his struggle with the multi-headed beast. Finally, after a long and fierce battle, Heracles succeeded in slaying the Hydra of Lerna. The hero then dipped his arrows in the creature's poisonous blood, a decision that would later have significant consequences in both his own life and the wider Greek mythological world. By overcoming the seemingly insurmountable challenge of defeating the Hydra, Heracles further elevated his status as a legendary hero and cemented his reputation for strength, cunning, and determination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Former Houston Texan Star Mario Williams Involved in Legal Battle Over 785,000 Diamond Ring Introduction: Former Houston Texans defensive end, Mario Williams, is currently embroiled in a legal dispute with his ex-fiancee, Erin Marzouki, over the return of an expensive engagement ring. The ring, valued at 785,000, has become the center of a heated lawsuit wherein both parties are levying accusations against one another. Background on the Dispute: According to reports, Mario Williams is suing his ex-fiancee Erin Marzouki in an effort to reclaim the diamond engagement ring, alleging that she used him to acquire financial support and never intended to wed. In a surprising turn of events, Marzouki is now counter-suing Williams, accusing him of filing the lawsuit for the primary purpose of harassing her. Marzouki's Counterclaim: Erin Marzouki's legal team has pushed back against Williams' claims, stating that the former NFL star had, in fact, terminated their engagement multiple times but never requested the return of the ring. It remains unclear whether Williams' previous reluctance to ask for the ring back will significantly impact the outcome of the lawsuit. Williams' Allegations: Mario Williams' representation asserts that his ex-fiancee took advantage of his income and never had any real intentions of marrying him. They argue that her actions constitute fraud and necessitate the return of the pricey engagement ring. Legal Implications and Public Interest: As the legal battle between Mario Williams and Erin Marzouki intensifies, the public gaze has been drawn to the details of the case. The high-profile nature of the case combined with the unique circumstances surrounding their engagement and allegations on both sides adds an extra layer of intrigue to the proceedings. Conclusion: With both Mario Williams and Erin Marzouki standing their ground and firmly contesting the allegations against them, the resolution of this lawsuit promises to be far from straightforward. The upcoming legal proceedings will ultimately determine the fate of the 785,000 diamond engagement ring and, potentially, shed further light on the nature of their relationship and its eventual dissolution"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Carlos Tevez scored twice as Argentina beat Mexico 3-1 in Johannesburg, South Africa, to set up a meeting with Germany in the quarterfinals of the World Cup. The Manchester City striker opened the scoring after 25 minutes in controversial fashion when television replays, which were relayed on the giant screens in the stadium, showed he was offside when he received the ball from Lionel Messi and headed into the net. Despite protests from the Mexican players, the goal was allowed to stand. Argentina doubled its lead when Gonzalo Higuain rounded goalkeeper Oscar Perez to score his fourth goal of the tournament. Tevez made certain of the victory with a stunning long-range strike into the top corner early in the second half. Javier Hernandez pulled a goal back for Mexico with a powerful left-footed drive after 70 minutes, but it proved to be little more than a consolation for the Mexicans as Argentina easily claimed the victory. Manager Diego Maradona's men almost scored a fourth goal when Perez had to dive to his right in stoppage-time to tip Messi's shot over the bar. Mexico, who has now gone out in the last 16 at five World Cups in a row, may feel the result could have been different without the error from the officials. After seeing the error on the big screens, Mexican players surrounded the referee and his assistant but the officials decided not to revoke the goal. The controversy marked the second major officiating mistake of the day at the World Cup after England midfielder Frank Lampard was denied a goal against Germany, even though his shot struck the bar and bounced some two feet over the line.

The Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire. It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning Moesia, Macedonia and Thrace, roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, and this day is now a public holiday called National Liberation Day. The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country. This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as \\"the Balkan Prussia\\". It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at Doiran and Monastir, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.

Moscow says its first warplanes to take off from its aircraft carrier now stationed off the Syrian coast did not target Aleppo itself. But Russia's intensifying intervention could be a game changer in the protracted battle to control this strategic city and the momentum in this brutal war. The timing was expected: in a few months time a new President, with a new Syria policy, takes over in Washington. It was Russia's sudden decision in September 2015 to intervene militarily in Syria which marked the start of a decisive shift in the course of a brutal war which has come to define Syria. When we asked BBC News online readers what they wanted to know about Aleppo, the most popular question asked was, \\"Why is Russia helping the Assad regime?\\". Moscow has long-standing links to Syria, with many Syrian military officers trained and equipped by their Russian friends. But its decision to significantly boost its military, political, and moral support to Damascus did nothing less than rescue depleted Syrian forces from collapse on significant front lines under grinding pressure from an array of opposition forces. On a visit to Damascus shortly after Russia entered the fray, Syrian soldiers and officials hailed their strong cultural affinity with the Russians, as well as their gratitude in their hour of need. Air strikes resume on rebel-held Aleppo Why are people still living in east Aleppo? Life under siege in rebel-held Aleppo Why Assad wants to take Aleppo Aleppo: Key battleground in Syria's war Russian officials often say their intervention \\"stopped the black flags\\" of so-called Islamic State (IS) from being raised in the Syrian capital. The threat posed by Islamic extremists is very real. But strengthening President Assad was a winning move for Moscow on many fronts. It transformed Russia from a minor actor on the Syrian stage to the lead player which continues to resonate across the region. American officials warned a year ago that Russia's gambit would suck it into another Afghanistan quagmire which ended in humiliating and costly defeat during the Cold War. But even Arab allies of the Syrian opposition have at times privately expressed admiration for President Vladimir Putin's muscular backing for an ally, at so far limited cost. Russia's assets in Syria centre on its port at Tartus, its only seaport along the Mediterranean, as well as its newly established Khmeimim air base in the north-west, its only airfield in the Middle East. We asked readers to send in their questions about what is happening in Aleppo. Lyse chose four questions, and we asked you to select your favourite which was: \\"Why is Russia helping the Assad regime?\\" Take a look at some of the other questions you've wanted us to answer In October, Russia's parliament ratified an open-ended agreement to approve the base which revealed what had been a secret pact a year earlier to give Russia carte blanche to move personnel and cargo in and out of Syria, without inspection or interruption by Syrian authorities. Over the past year more troops and considerable firepower, including advanced missile systems, have been moved onto the battlefield. Russian media have also reported the presence of Russian special forces as well as thousands of Russians working for military companies. Russia and its Syrian ally cast their alliance as the winning team in the fight against IS. The capture of the ancient city of Palmyra last March - where Russia has now established a military post - is proof of that. But Western militaries and diplomats repeatedly accuse Moscow of targeting opposition groups backed by the West, as well as attacking schools and hospitals which put civilians in harm's way. Accusations of possible war crimes are now a constant refrain. For Russia, this new projection of military power is about more than just Syria. It's one axis in a broader geopolitical battle to take what it sees as its rightful place at the world's top tables, on equal par with the power and prestige of the United States. Endless talks with US Secretary of State John Kerry about finding a negotiated way out in Syria masked the quest for another prize - military to military co-operation, including intelligence sharing, which the Pentagon balks at. For Russia, the redrawing of the map stretches to Ukraine and beyond in Moscow's new Cold War tensions with Nato nations. Russia and Iran are on the same side in this war, along with Lebanese Hezbollah forces, and a dizzying array of fighters from far and wide including Iraqis and Afghans. Iran's interests are different but no less essential: preserving its land corridor and access to Hezbollah in neighbouring Lebanon, protecting Shia shrines, and consolidating its growing geopolitical sway across the region at the expense of powerful Sunni rivals such as Saudi Arabia. Both Iran and Russia have the back as well as the ear of President Assad, but not his complete acquiescence. The Syrian leader has long been a shrewd operator when it comes to playing his foreign friends off each other. When President Putin suddenly announced last March that he was pulling out \\"the main part\\" of Russian forces in Syria, talk in Damascus immediately turned to how Iran would fill any vacuum. There has long been intense speculation over whether President Assad's most crucial allies would eventually try to nudge him aside for another less controversial strong man. But they continue to insist the Syrian leader still commands popular support. For now, it suits them to keep him in charge. And now US President-elect Donald Trump looks set to join this axis, at least in the fight against IS and the group once known as the Nusra Front which has been linked to al-Qaeda. President Assad has already called Mr Trump a \\"natural ally\\". President Putin gambled last year when he entered Syria's great game. Western leaders often say he played a weak hand, and admit he's played it well - at least where it matters to him, and his allies.

(December 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Pardes is a story that revolves around Arjun (Shah Rukh Khan) and Ganga (Mahima Chaudhary). Kishorilal (Amrish Puri), a wealthy Indian businessman living in America, visits his old friend Suraj Dev (Alok Nath) in India. During his stay at the conservative, traditional Indian household, he gets to know Suraj's eldest daughter, Ganga, who shares his love for India and Indian culture. Ganga's younger siblings are enchanted by the uncle from America, and because they perceive Western culture and values to be so desirable, they cook up a plan to impress him with an English song. Unimpressed, he sings back a hymn-like song in a more traditional Indian style, \\"I love my India.\\" Ganga joins in this song, expressing her equal love for India. The song emphasises the movie's theme in key moments. Kishorilal asks Suraj to promise Ganga as a bride for his westernised son, Rajiv (Apoorva Agnihotri). He is convinced that Ganga will be not only a perfect bride, but the way treasured Indian values are revived and passed on in his Americanized family and large circle of Indian friends and business acquaintances. Suraj's family accepts the proposal. Kishorilal knows he will have a tough time trying to convince his son to marry or even meet Ganga. Back in America, he asks his foster son, Arjun (Shahrukh Khan) to help his plan along. Arjun, who has been working in Kishorilal's personal garage and making music with his band, is being interviewed as the composer of the new musical hit \\"I Love My India\\". However, when Kishorilal calls to ask for his help, his loyalty to his uncle is so strong that he cuts the interview short.

Context: Abnormalities of lung coagulation and fibrinolysis in sarcoidosis are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease.', 'We previously showed that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) D dimer directly correlated with various measures of severity in sarcoidosis. Here, we analyze our observation that BALF D dimer was more frequently found at higher levels in African-American patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.', 'BALF D dimer was measured in 55 subjects with pulmonary sarcoidosis and 31 healthy volunteers by enzyme immunoassay. The healthy group established a normal range of BALF D dimer with 71 ng/ml as the highest measured level. This was the cut point for comparisons among the patients with sarcoidosis.', 'High BALF D dimer levels (>71 ng/ml) were found in younger patients with sarcoidosis and were associated with a significantly lower percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s and greater numbers of BAL lymphocytes. Black patients with sarcoidosis had higher BALF D dimer levels (median 131, range 0-2,040 ng/ml) than white patients (median 18, range 0-605 ng/ml; p = 0.011). Higher than normal BALF D dimer levels were found in 61% of the black subjects with sarcoidosis, but in only 20% of the white individuals (chi(2) = 5.539, p = 0.019). BALF D dimer was the only disease measure that discriminated black from white individuals with sarcoidosis. Answer: BALF D dimer is an indicator of lung fibrin formation and degradation in sarcoidosis. The relationship of high D dimer levels with greater BAL lymphocytosis and worse lung function may be a marker of active sarcoidosis, especially in African-Americans who tend to suffer a more serious form of the disease.

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? mold is only found where you want it","completion":"Based on the given paragraph, we cannot conclude that the sentence \\"mold is only found where you want it\\" is true. In fact, the paragraph suggests the opposite. The passage mentions that \\"mold can sometimes creep in where you least expect or want it to, all around the home.” This statement indicates that mold can grow and spread in various places where it is not desired or expected. Furthermore, the paragraph highlights that mold comes in different colors, such as green, pink, and black, which can be alarming and potentially pose health concerns. Mold growth is typically a result of excess moisture or humidity, and it can thrive in hidden or poorly ventilated areas, such as kitchens, bathrooms, or basements. The presence of mold can not only affect the appearance of your surroundings but also cause unpleasant odors and lead to potential health problems, particularly for individuals who are sensitive to mold or suffer from allergies and respiratory issues. To maintain a fresh and environmentally sound home, it is essential to take preventive measures against mold growth. Some effective strategies include controlling the moisture level in your house, ensuring proper ventilation, and regularly cleaning and inspecting vulnerable areas. By adopting such practices, one can reduce the risk of mold growth and create a healthier living environment. In summary, the paragraph suggests that mold is not only found where you want it, but it can also appear in unwanted and unexpected places in your home. It is crucial to be vigilant and take appropriate preventive measures to keep your surroundings safe, clean, and green."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder which, paired with his misanthropy, alienates nearly everyone with whom he interacts. He avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks while walking through the city due to a superstition of bad luck, and eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant every day using disposable plastic utensils he brings with him due to his pathological fear of germs. He takes an interest in his waitress, Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his behavior. One day, Melvin's apartment neighbor, a gay artist named Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), is assaulted and nearly killed during a robbery. Melvin is intimidated by Simon's agent, Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), into caring for Simon's dog, Verdell, while Simon is hospitalized. Although he initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, Melvin becomes emotionally attached to it. He simultaneously receives more attention from Carol. When Simon is released from the hospital, Melvin is unable to cope emotionally with returning the dog.

Context: I had seen it before, those fuzzy, furry leaves and stalks, with the pretty, star-pointed purple flowers, but up until that moment that I saw them sitting in a basket at the market stalls, I admit I had never taken notice of it as a food. It grow along cracks in stone walls and along the roadside near my home in Settignano, which is blooming with spring goodness right now: robinia (black locust) trees, wild garlic (three-cornered leek) and even elderflowers are already bursting. I asked the vendor just to double check, “Is this borage?” “Si,” Came the answer, “Borragine.” He confirmed. “I’ve had it in ravioli,” I started to say, “Brava!” He said, as if we were about to start a guessing game on what could be done with it. Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand. Then there’s risotto and of course the fritters, much like these ones. Or you can simply deep fry the clusters of buds that haven’t yet burst open like these deep-fried robinia flowers. borage and ricotta crepes The problem, I was thinking, as I took home my bag of borage, is that I can’t decide what to make. There’s simply too much choice. I consulted two of my favourite books that also happen to be cookbooks. Patience Gray’s Honey from a Weed and Luigi Ballerini’s A Feast of Weeds. Both had wonderful ideas for borage (and indeed many other edible, foraged plants). Question: Who bought the flowers?

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The story takes place in the fertile, eastern lands bordered by the Mediterranean Sea and kept by the gods. Within the cradle of ancient civilization empires are built, wars fought, alliances forged, and heroes born.Agamemnon (Brian Cox), king of Mycenae, has united most of Greece's kingdoms under his rule and now advances his army upon the nation of Thessaly, hoping to include it in his collection of ever-growing conquests. King Triopas (Julian Glover) bargains with Agamemnon to each let one of their best fighters decide who wins the battle rather than engaging in open war. Triopas calls upon the giant Boagrius (Nathan Jones) while Agamemnon calls to Achilles, but the legendary warrior is nowhere to be found. A messenger boy (Jacob Smith) is sent to fetch him and Agamemnon curses the stubborn nature of the fiercest warrior Greece has ever seen. A half-god and blessed with incomparable strength and skill, Achilles lives to fight but he refuses to associate with Agamemnon, preferring instead to seek his own destiny and be immortalized in history. Achilles easily defeats Boagrius, sealing Agamemnon's control over the nation, and calls out if there is anyone else worthy enough to fight him.Meanwhile, Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) of Troy feast in the banquet hall of King Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) as honored guests and peace ambassadors to their home nation. However, young Paris sneaks away to be with Menelaus' beautiful wife, Helen (Diane Kruger), whom he loves dearly. He convinces her to come back with him to Troy, stowing her away on his brother's ship. When Hector finds out he is clearly angry but it is too late to return to Sparta with Helen and seek pardon. Finding Helen gone, Menelaus vows revenge on Troy and seeks the approval of his brother, Agamemnon, who is only too happy to oblige, though Agamemnon's decision comes mostly from his desire to sack Troy.Odysseus (Sean Bean), king of Ithaca and under command of Agamemnon, goes to convince Achilles to accompany them in the...

Megan, who was always up for trying something new, decided to give it a shot even though she had never been on a skateboard before. Sarah was excited to share her newfound passion with her best friend, and they planned a day at the local park to get started. The day finally came, and Sarah brought along her own skateboard as well as a spare one she borrowed from her older brother, just for Megan. Before they started, Sarah thought it was essential to go over the basic safety rules and equipment. She emphasized the importance of wearing a helmet, knee and elbow pads, and proper footwear to minimize the risk of injury. Once Megan was all geared up, they found a flat, open area in the park to practice. The first thing Sarah taught Megan was how to stand on a skateboard correctly. She showed her how to align her feet with the width of her shoulders, placing her front foot just behind the front trucks and her back foot over the rear trucks. They practiced their stance for a few minutes, adjusting their feet and maintaining balance. Next, Sarah demonstrated the correct way to push off on a skateboard. Megan watched as Sarah started with her back foot on the tail of the board, pushed off with her front foot, and then placed it back on the board to balance. Megan tried it a few times and, after a few shaky starts, she began to get the hang of it. Sarah then explained how to steer the skateboard. \\"Leaning is the key,\\" she said. \\"If you want to go left, just lean to the left. The same goes for the right. If you shift your weight, the trucks and wheels will follow.\\" Megan followed Sarah's instructions and gradually started to steer with more confidence. Working on their balance, Sarah suggested practicing bending their knees while riding. This helped Megan maintain her balance on the board and absorb bumps or uneven surfaces they encountered. They practiced for a while, gradually increasing their speed, and Megan began to feel more comfortable on the skateboard. As Megan's confidence grew, Sarah decided it was time to learn some basic tricks. They started with a manual, which is balancing on the rear wheels while keeping the nose of the skateboard off the ground. After several attempts, Megan managed to pull off a short manual, much to her delight. Seeing Megan's progress, Sarah decided to show her how to do an ollie, a basic trick that involves jumping with the skateboard. Sarah demonstrated the process of sliding her front foot forward while pulling up on the back end of the board to lift it into the air. Megan found this trick a bit trickier than the manual but was determined to learn it. After many attempts and a few falls, Megan finally landed her first ollie. As the sun began to set, Sarah and Megan decided to call it a day, both exhilarated by their progress and the fun they had skateboarding together. They made a pact to meet regularly to practice their newfound skills and explore new skate spots around the city. Weeks went by, and the two friends continued practicing and learning new tricks together, gradually getting better and more confident on their boards. They even started joining other skateboarders at the local skatepark, learning from more experienced riders and making new friends within the skateboarding community. Sarah was proud to see Megan develop into a skilled skateboarder, and they both cherished the bonding experience. As they cruised together through city sidewalks and empty parking lots, they felt the freedom of the wind in their hair and the joy of sharing a passion that would forever connect them as friends."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Sure it may seem appealing to be able to play your music and turn up your TV as loud as you want, but coming home to an empty room every day can be depressing. If you have a bad day, you may want to talk to someone. Friends are great sources of venting , but friends can't always be there. Even worse, they may be selfcentered and show no interest in your problem. It's not that roommates aren't like this, but even just small talk can help you feel better. Having a roommate teaches you how to get along with people and settle conflict. You two should set up rules immediately and discuss what to do when there is conflict.

Beer was priced from 12.00 to 14.00. Twitter users, including sportscasters, blasted the astonishingly high prices on their pages. Article:","completion":"Title: Skyrocketing Concession Prices at MetLife Stadium Leave Fans and Sportscasters Outraged MetLife Stadium, the sprawling state-of-the-art facility in New Jersey known for hosting NFL events and world-class concerts, recently came under fire for its soaring concession prices. Fans attending various events at the stadium, including football games and live performances, have been left aghast at the eye-watering cost of food and beverages, with some items reaching staggering highs of 20.00. Twitter users, including influential sportscasters, subsequently took to the social media platform to express their disdain. One of the most notable examples of exorbitant pricing at the stadium was hot chocolate, served in a souvenir mug. Costing an astounding 20.00, fans were left incredulous at the mammoth difference that the souvenir mug made to the overall price; without the mug, the hot chocolate's cost stood at a still alarming 11.00. The considerable markup on a seemingly simple beverage fueled widespread backlash from event-goers. Additionally, the price of beer at MetLife Stadium skyrocketed, ranging from 12.00 to 14.00. The surge begged the question: have concession prices reached a tipping point? Fans accustomed to inflated prices at sporting events and concerts were still left reeling at the spike, as many had never encountered costs this high for a standard concession item. In response to the mounting criticism, several sportscasters joined the discussion, lambasting the concession prices on their Twitter accounts. The added exposure from these influential figures only served to stimulate further backlash, as their followers echoed their disgruntlement and astonishment at the levies. The situation has since escalated from isolated complaints to a full-fledged debate on the affordability and accessibility of attending live events. While it's common knowledge that food and drink at stadiums or arenas often come with substantial markups to cover the associated costs, the staggering prices at MetLife Stadium certainly raise concerns about the ethics behind such profit margins. Critics argue that such price hikes not only alienate fans but also tarnish the overall experience of attending events at these venues. This incident has opened up a wider dialogue on the pricing strategy employed by stadiums and concert venues, with many questioning the value of attending events at these settings. Balancing the responsibility of covering operational costs while providing an enjoyable environment for fans emerges as a crucial consideration for venue management. In conclusion, the controversy surrounding the concession prices at MetLife Stadium has undeniably highlighted how the accessibility of live events can be compromised by unreasonable price hikes. Reaffirming the need to strike a balance between economic considerations and fan satisfaction, venue owners and operators must take stock of the weight this issue holds on their customer base that, if left unaddressed, may lead to long-term damage to their brand and reputation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a question about the following article: During the 1920s, specifically In 1928, the components of the Dow were increased to 30 stocks near the economic height of that decade, which was nicknamed the Roaring Twenties. This period downplayed the influence of an early Depression of 1920–21 plus certain international conflicts such as the Polish-Soviet war, the Irish Civil War, the Turkish War of Independence and the initial phase of the Chinese Civil War. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression over the next several years returned the average to its starting point, almost 90% below its peak. By July 8, 1932, following its intra-day low of 40.56, the Dow would end up closing the session at 41.22. The high of 381.17 on September 3, 1929, would not be surpassed until 1954, in inflation-adjusted numbers. However, the bottom of the 1929 Crash came just 2½ months later on November 13, 1929, when intra-day it was at the 195.35 level, closing slightly higher at 198.69. For the decade, the Dow would end off with a healthy 131.7% gain, from 107.23 points at the beginning of 1920, to a level of 248.48 points at the end of 1929, just before the Crash of 1929.

Make this lower case.","completion":"one very effective and productive procedure that they developed was to use the bulldozers in teams of three rather than having them work separately. This approach of utilizing the bulldozers in teams has demonstrated various benefits in terms of efficiency, coordination, and overall productivity. By working collaboratively in teams of three, these heavy machinery units can tackle more significant obstacles and challenges than they would if they were to operate individually. This teamwork-oriented method has proven itself to be an innovative and advantageous approach in the construction and excavation industry. Some of the key benefits of having the bulldozers work in teams of three include: 1. Improved efficiency: Working in teams enables the bulldozers to increase their speed and accomplish tasks with greater precision. The synchronization of their movements results in better allocation of resources and time, leading to quicker project completion. 2. Enhanced communication: When bulldozers work in teams, operators can effectively communicate with each other to ensure that they're working in harmony. This clear communication helps to prevent any misunderstandings or errors that might arise if the bulldozers were working independently. 3. Streamlined processes: Teams of bulldozers can systematically break down tasks to streamline work processes, making the overall project more efficient. This reduces the chances of delays and bottlenecks, ensuring the project runs smoothly and stays on schedule. 4. Mutual support: When bulldozers operate in teams, they can provide crucial backup support for each other in challenging situations. This mutual assistance can help increase overall safety, prevent accidents, and limit the potential for damage to equipment and construction sites. 5. Task specialization: Within a team of bulldozers, each unit can be assigned specific roles based on its strengths and capabilities. By focusing on their areas of expertise, the bulldozers can perform optimally, contributing their unique skills to enhance the team's overall performance. 6. Reduced downtime: In case one bulldozer encounters a malfunction or requires maintenance, the team can continue working with the remaining units, reducing the negative impact of downtime on the project. 7. Shared learning: When bulldozers work together in a team, the operators have the opportunity to learn from each other's experiences and expertise. This shared learning fosters an environment of continuous improvement, ensuring optimal performance and overcoming obstacles more effectively. In conclusion, employing bulldozers in teams of three rather than having them work separately has yielded numerous advantages in terms of efficiency, communication, and mutual support. By embracing a teamwork-oriented approach, construction and excavation projects can reap the benefits of improved productivity and reduced timeframes, making this a key strategy for continued success in the industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Other drugs on the market, approved to treat mild to moderate Alzheimer's, are believed to work by inhibiting cholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine which is a chemical used by nerves to communicate with each other. Can we infer the following? Inhibiting cholinesterase can help nerves communicate with each other","completion":"Yes, we can infer that inhibiting cholinesterase can help nerves communicate with each other in the context of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. By understanding the mechanism and role of cholinesterase inhibitors, we can see how these drugs have the potential to improve communication between nerve cells, which is typically affected in Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral changes. One of the major changes observed in AD brains is a decrease in the function of neurotransmitter systems, including the cholinergic system. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter that plays essential roles in several brain functions such as learning, memory, and attention. In AD, the cholinergic system is impaired due to the loss of cholinergic neurons, which results in reduced acetylcholine levels. Cholinesterase, which includes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), is an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft (the space between two neurons). When acetylcholine is broken down, its signal is terminated, and the communication between neurons stops. Under normal conditions, this process is tightly regulated. However, in Alzheimer's disease, as the number of cholinergic neurons decreases and the production of acetylcholine becomes insufficient, the communications between neurons are further weakened. In this scenario, the use of cholinesterase inhibitors can provide a therapeutic benefit. By inhibiting the activity of cholinesterase enzymes, these drugs effectively slow down the breakdown of acetylcholine. This results in an increase in the concentration of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, allowing for improved communication between neurons. Currently, there are several cholinesterase inhibitors approved for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine. Clinical trials have shown that these drugs can help improve cognitive function and slow down the progression of the disease to some extent. However, it's important to note that cholinesterase inhibitors are not a cure for Alzheimer's, but rather a means to manage some of its symptoms. In conclusion, inhibiting cholinesterase can help nerves communicate with each other in the context of mild to moderate Alzheimer's, where the cholinergic system is impaired and the communication between neurons is compromised. Cholinesterase inhibitors work by slowing down the enzymatic breakdown of acetylcholine, increasing its availability in the synaptic cleft and subsequently enhancing neuronal communication. While these drugs can provide symptomatic improvements in cognitive function, they are not a definitive cure for Alzheimer's disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Joseph welcomed him inside, his charismatic smile beaming as he shook Kevin's hand and beckoned him into his living room. \\"Kevin, it's so good to see you! I'm thrilled you've finally decided to come over,\\" Joseph expressed, leading him towards a large, leather couch. \\"I promise you won't regret this.\\" Joseph's house was updated, modern, and elegant. The white walls were adorned with minimalist paintings, each piece projecting an aura of tranquility that seemed to mirror Joseph's personality. As Kevin sank into the leather, he could not help but feel a sense of calm wash over him. Joseph perched on the adjacent armchair and began his discussion with a few questions about Kevin's current skincare routine, his diet, and his overall lifestyle habits. As Kevin provided detailed descriptions, Joseph's face reflected thoughtful consideration. After hearing Kevin out, Joseph leaned forward and said: \\"First, let me share a valuable piece of advice with you: there is no one-size-fits-all answer to skincare, as each person's skin is unique. However, there are certain cornerstone principles that can help you tailor your routine to achieve the best possible results.\\" Joseph then proceeded to shed light onto his own skincare regimen, starting with the importance of a consistent routine. He pointed out that by diligently sticking to his twice-daily cleansing, moisturizing, and applying sunscreen, he had been able to dramatically improve his skin's overall health. Joseph also stressed the importance of being patient and gentle with your skin, advising Kevin to avoid picking or scratching at it as this could lead to scarring. When the conversation turned to diet, Joseph revealed that he paid special attention to the nutrients he consumed and the effect they had on his skin. He followed a balanced diet consisting of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Most notably, Joseph attributed his flawless complexion to his diligent water intake, hydrating his skin from within. Discussing lifestyle choices, Joseph advised Kevin on the importance of getting proper rest, as sleep played a critical role in the skin's natural rejuvenation and repair processes. Additionally, Joseph shared his dedication to exercise, stating that regular physical activity increased blood circulation, which subsequently helped nourish skin cells and cleanse them from the inside. As much as these personal tips and tricks were enlightening, Joseph knew it was essential that Kevin see a dermatologist to get a professional diagnosis and personalized treatment plan for his specific skin conditions. He recommended an esteemed doctor in their city and assured Kevin that the combination of his own guidance and the doctor's expert opinion would eventually lead him to healthy, vibrant skin. As Kevin left Joseph's house that evening, he felt a renewed sense of hope. He realized that achieving his desired complexion would require patience, discipline, and active engagement in his skincare journey. And as he turned towards his reflection, he saw the beginning of a promising transformation, one that would be reflected not just on his skin, but in the newfound confidence that he would soon begin to experience from within."},{"prompt":"Two neighboring countries with similar economies, followed different political and economical agendas. Niger developed its infrastructure and communications technology, while Nigeria didn't. Which country will be more developed as a consequence of their agendas? Hint: Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease. With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1] Answer:","completion":"Niger will be more developed as a consequence of their agendas. This is because their focus on developing infrastructure and communications technology reduces the effects of distance decay. By improving connectivity and communication, the country can foster increased cultural and economic interactions, both within its borders and with other countries.

Michael Williams is a drifter living out of his car after being discharged from the Marine Corps. A job on an oilfield falls through due to his unwillingness to conceal a war injury on his job application, so Michael wanders into rural Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for other work. A local bar owner named Wayne mistakes him for a hit man, \\"Lyle from Dallas\\", whom Wayne has hired to kill his wife. Wayne offers him a stack of cash—\\"half now, half later\\"—and Michael plays along by taking the money. Michael visits Wayne's wife, Suzanne and attempts to warn her that her life is in danger instead of killing her. She offers him more money to kill Wayne. Michael tries to leave town but a car accident leads him to encounter the local sheriff, who turns out to be Wayne. Michael manages to escape from Wayne but runs into the real Lyle from Dallas. Lyle and Wayne quickly figure out what has transpired, while Michael desperately tries to warn Suzanne before Lyle finds her. The next morning, when Lyle comes to get money from Wayne, he kidnaps both Suzanne and Michael, who are trying to retrieve hidden cash from Wayne's office. Wayne and Suzanne are revealed to be wanted for embezzlement and Wayne is arrested by his own deputies. Lyle returns with Michael and Suzanne hostage and gets Wayne out of jail to retrieve their stash of money. At a remote graveyard, Wayne pulls a gun from the case of money and holds Lyle at gunpoint before Lyle throws a knife into Wayne's neck. Michael and Lyle fight, with Lyle ending up being impaled on a grave marker. When Lyle rises to attack Michael, Suzanne shoots him dead.

The film opens with the mirroring of a gloomy sky on the placid Baltic Sea waters at the Faro Island shores, near Gotland's northernmost tip. Four bathers, all in a jovial mood, splashing and joking, are returning from a swim in the cold sea. As they reach the jetty, the youngest members of the quartet, Karin (Harriet Andersson) and her teenage brother, Fredrik, known as Minus (Lars Passgard), are sent off to get some milk at a nearby farm, while Karin's physician husband, Martin (Max von Sydow), and her father, David (Gunnar Bjorstrand), a writer, go and set up their fishing nets. David has just returned from Switzerland, where he was finishing writing his latest novel, and their task gives them a private opportunity to discuss Karin's status, whose schizophrenia has been diagnosed as most likely incurable.On the way to the farm, Minus expresses his hope that their father will be successful with his latest novel's publication. On the way back, Minus confides in his sister his sexual apprehensions, which eventually degenerates into his admonishment of Karin for the (maybe) too intimate attention she keeps showing toward him. But most importantly, he confesses how much he wishes he could communicate with his father.The quartet is reunited for the evening dinner around a table in front of their cottage. Again, a festive atmosphere prevails, but soon turns sour. David confesses that while he was anxious to return to his family after his long absence, that he is about to leave again, in spite of his earlier promise to his children not to travel so often.

The girl had to go to the mental hospital while the boy didn't because the","completion":"girl had been struggling with severe mental health issues for quite some time, while the boy seemed to be coping reasonably well with the stresses and challenges in his life. As the girl's mental state continued to deteriorate, her behavior became increasingly erratic and dangerous, both to herself and to those around her. Her parents, fearing for her safety and well-being, finally made the difficult decision to have her admitted to the mental hospital. The boy, on the other hand, had a strong support system in place and was able to find ways to work through his problems without resorting to self-destructive behaviors or becoming a danger to himself or others. Despite the challenges they both faced, the boy's resilience and the reliable network of friends, family, and professional support he had access to meant that in this case, the boy didn't need to go to the mental hospital the same way the girl did. At the mental hospital, the girl underwent a full psychological and medical evaluation by a team of dedicated mental health professionals. They diagnosed her with a combination of disorders, including major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder. These disorders severely impacted her ability to function in everyday life, engage in healthy interpersonal relationships and make well-balanced decisions. After the diagnosis, the girl began a comprehensive treatment program specifically tailored to her unique needs. This involved a combination of evidence-based treatments like individual psychotherapy, group therapy, and medication management, as well as adjunct therapies such as art therapy and mindfulness-based interventions. The girl’s treatment team worked closely with her and her family to develop an understanding of her disorders, establish treatment goals, and implement a plan for recovery while simultaneously providing constant support, guidance, and encouragement. Throughout her stay at the mental hospital, the girl learned valuable coping skills and tools to help her navigate through her emotional struggles and develop a more adaptive way of handling her thoughts and emotions. As she progressed through her treatment, she gradually began to gain a better understanding of herself and her mental health issues, and started to regain control over her life. Meanwhile, the boy continued to face his own challenges but managed to keep moving forward, thanks to his support system and the coping strategies he had developed. He made a conscious effort to educate himself about mental health in an attempt to understand the girl’s situation better and empathize with her struggles. Between school, work, and his social life, the boy took the time to visit the girl at the mental hospital whenever he could, offering her encouragement and empathy. He also attended support groups, such as NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), where he received guidance and fellowship from people who had experienced similar situations with their loved ones. As time passed, the girl made significant improvements in her mental health, and her treatment team deemed her stable enough to be discharged from the mental hospital. With the love and support of her family, friends, and the boy, the girl re-entered society and began the long journey toward creating a healthier and happier life for herself. Through this experience, both the girl and the boy gained a newfound appreciation for the importance of mental health and the power of understanding, acceptance, and empathy for those suffering from mental illnesses. Together, they became advocates for mental health awareness and sought to break the stigma surrounding mental illness, helping others recognize the courage and resilience it takes to face these challenges head-on."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

This park, located in the stunning city of Copenhagen, is truly a gem, offering an array of pleasant sights and experiences. Rich in history and nature, the park covers a vast expanse of land, featuring magnificent gardens, lush greenery, and exquisite architecture. Complementing our frequent visits to the park, we were also avid at honing our horse riding skills and often partook in training sessions at Rideskolen, a reputable and nearby riding school. It wasn't just about improving our equestrian abilities; it was about bonding with such noble and majestic creatures while cultivating a sense of discipline and camaraderie. My friendship with Helle was genuinely a bond that held strong, weathering the storms that life occasionally throws our way. Truthfully, we were inseparable. Our shared experiences, challenges, and laughs served as the glue that ensured our friendship was woven tightly together like strands of a fine tapestry.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system. - DVD (an abbreviation of \\"digital versatile disc\\" or \\"digital video disc\\") is a digital optical disc storage format invented and developed by Philips, Sony, Toshiba, and Panasonic in 1995. The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using DVD players. DVDs offer higher storage capacity than compact discs while having the same dimensions. - Nolan Kay Bushnell (born February 5, 1943) is an American electrical engineer and businessman. He established Atari, Inc. and the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza-Time Theaters chain. Bushnell has been inducted into the Video Game Hall of Fame and the Consumer Electronics Association Hall of Fame, received the BAFTA Fellowship and the Nations Restaurant News Innovator of the Year award, and was named one of \\"Newsweek\\"s \\"50 Men Who Changed America.\\" Bushnell has started more than twenty companies and is one of the founding fathers of the video game industry. He is currently on the board of Anti-Aging Games, but his latest venture is an educational software company called Brainrush that is using video game technology in educational software, incorporating real brain science, in a way that Bushnell believes will fundamentally change education. Nolan, who is co-founder and chairman of Brainrush, believes that Brainrush will be his biggest success. - A ROM cartridge, sometimes referred to simply as a cartridge or cart, is a removable enclosure containing ROM designed to be connected to a consumer electronics device such as a home computer, video game console and to a lesser extent, electronic musical instruments. ROM cartridges can be used to load software such as video games or other application programs. - Activision Publishing , Inc. is an American video game publisher . It was founded on October 1 , 1979 and was the world 's first independent developer and distributor of video games for gaming consoles . Its first products were cartridges for the Atari 2600 video console system published from July 1980 for the US market and from August 1981 for the international market ( UK ) . Activision is now one of the largest third party video game publishers in the world and was also the top publisher for 2007 in the United States . On January 18 , 2008 , Activision announced they were the top US publisher in 2007 , according to the NPD Group . Its former CEO is Robert Kotick , who was the Chief Executive Officer of Activision , Inc. since February 1991 until Activision and Vivendi Games merged on July 9 , 2008 to create the newly formed company known as Activision Blizzard . On July 25 , 2013 , Activision Blizzard announced the purchase of 429 million shares from owner Vivendi , valuing US 2.34 billion . As a result , Activision Blizzard became an independent company . - Market research is any organized effort to gather information about target markets or customers. It is a very important component of business strategy. The term is commonly interchanged with marketing research; however, expert practitioners may wish to draw a distinction, in that \\"marketing\\" research is concerned specifically about marketing processes, while \\"market\\" research is concerned specifically with markets. - The Atari 2600 (or Atari VCS before 1982) is a home video game console by Atari, Inc. Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit. - Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports arcade video game. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as \\"Computer Space\\" came before it, \\"Pong\\" was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created \\"Pong\\" as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - Marketing is the study and management of exchange relationships. The American Marketing Association has defined marketing as \\"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\\" - Ted Dabney is the co-founder of Syzygy and Atari. While working at Ampex Dabney met Nolan Bushnell and the two jointly created Syzygy with their first product being \\"Computer Space\\", which was manufactured and sold by Nutting Associates. Following Computer Space, Ted Dabney's video circuit that was created for Computer Space was used by Al Alcorn to create \\"Pong\\", with assistance from Dabney and Bushnell. Dabney remained out of the public eye after departing Atari and his role in creating the first commercially produced coin-op video game as well as Syzygy and Atari was often omitted or marginalized with several myths attached. Dabney appeared on the RetroGaming Roundup podcast in October 2010 and told his story in a two-hour interview. - A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that they have either developed internally or have had developed by a video game developer. As with book publishers or publishers of DVD movies, video game publishers are responsible for their product's manufacturing and marketing, including market research and all aspects of advertising. - The Fairchild Channel F is a home video game console released by Fairchild Semiconductor in November 1976 across North America at the retail price of 169.95. It was also released in Japan in October the following year. It has the distinction of being the first programmable ROM cartridgebased video game console, and the first console to use a microprocessor. It was launched as the Video Entertainment System, or VES, but when Atari released its VCS the next year, Fairchild renamed its machine. By 1977, the Fairchild Channel F had sold 250,000 units, trailing behind sales of the VCS. - Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\". - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Atari Interactive is a name used by several separate groups and corporations since the mid-1990s. In 1996, it was the name of Atari Corporation's PC publishing division, bringing games like the Atari Jaguar's \\"Tempest 2000\\" to the PC platform. From 1998 to 2001, Atari Interactive, Inc. was the name of the corporate entity that held the Atari properties purchased from JTS by Hasbro in 1998, and functioned as the retro publishing subsidiary of Hasbro Interactive. It is currently the name of a wholly owned subsidiary of Atari, SA (formerly Infogrames), who is the current owner of the Atari brand and various other properties formerly belonging to Hasbro Interactive. It was formed in 2001, when IESA acquired Hasbro Interactive and proceeded to rename it to Infogrames Interactive. In 2003, IESA then changed the company name entirely to Atari Interactive, Inc. as part of its worldwide reorganization to focus on use of the Atari brand. - Atari, Inc. was an American video game developer and home computer company founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. Primarily responsible for the formation of the video arcade and modern video game industries, the company was closed and its assets split in 1984 as a direct result of the North American video game crash of 1983. - A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play. - A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development the process and related disciplines of creating video games. A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programming, design, art, testing, etc. Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support. Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games. - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost.

Answer:","completion":"Frederick Varley, born Frederick Horsman Varley on January 2, 1881, in Sheffield, England, was a renowned painter known for his association with the Group of Seven. The Group of Seven was a collective of Canadian landscape painters established in the early 20th century who were dedicated to capturing the natural beauty of the Canadian wilderness. As a child, Varley showed an interest in art, which led him to study at various art schools in England. In 1912, he immigrated to Canada, settling initially in Toronto, Ontario. There, he worked as both a commercial artist and an art teacher, inspiring generations of Canadian artists. His passion for painting fueled his artistic pursuits, and he quickly established himself as a talented landscape painter. Varley's illustrious career as a painter took a turn in 1920 when he joined the Group of Seven. Alongside his fellow artists, he embraced the bold use of color and expressive brushstrokes to capture the unique character of Canadian landscapes. Varley's work within the Group of Seven contributed significantly to the development of the Canadian art scene, and he eventually gained international recognition for his evocative paintings. Throughout his life, Varley continued to paint and teach, contributing to the expansion of the Canadian art scene. His work has since become synonymous with the country's artistic identity. After a life dedicated to the arts, Frederick Horsman Varley passed away in Toronto, Ontario, on September 8, 1969. Overall, Frederick Varley's life is best remembered for his exceptional painting skills and his impact on Canadian art through his involvement in the Group of Seven. His dedication to capturing the essence of Canadian landscapes has left a lasting impression on the country's artistic identity, and his influence continues to be felt in today's art world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. They were looking for human remains. But all they found were some shoes and a pile of black ash. It was hot in the basement. The fire was still smouldering. Warm, scummy water dripped from the ceiling. Outside, hundreds of people had gathered. Being there was a form of defiance. In the Iraqi capital, any crowded, dark street is a potential target for a suicide bomber. Perhaps sharing infinite sadness makes it easier to bear. Many people cried, or prayed. I saw a Christian clergyman lighting candles and making the sign of the cross as well as young people chanting a Shia Muslim anthem for the dead. Just because so many Iraqi civilians have been massacred does not make senseless killing any easier to bear for the survivors. It is doubtful whether Iraqis who are so caught up in the pain of daily life will take much interest in the long-delayed publication of the UK's official inquiry into its part in the invasion of 2003. Many people I have spoken to have already made up their minds about the impact of the invasion on Iraq. One of these is Kadhim al-Jabbouri, a man who became a symbol of the Iraqi peoples' rejection and hatred of Saddam Hussein. On 9 April 2003, the American spearhead reached central Baghdad. Hours before they arrived, Kadhim, who was a champion weightlifter, decided to bring down the big bronze statue of Saddam Hussein that stood on a plinth in Firdous Square. Kadhim owned a popular motorcycle shop and was a Harley-Davidson expert. For a while he fixed Saddam's bikes, but after the regime executed 14 members of his family he refused any more work. The regime's response to his effrontery was to put him in jail for two years on trumped-up charges. Kadhim is a survivor. In prison, he started a gym and a weight-lifting club, and was eventually released in one of Saddam's periodic amnesties. But on the morning of 9 April, Kadhim wanted his own personal moment of liberation and revenge. He took his sledgehammer and began to swing it at the plinth beneath the towering bronze dictator. Journalists came out of the Palestine Hotel on the square and started broadcasting and taking pictures. Kadhim says their presence protected him from Saddam's secret policemen, who melted away as the sound of American guns came closer. When the Americans arrived they looped a steel cable round the bronze Saddam's head and used a winch to help Kadhim finish the job. It all happened live on international TV. The image of furious and delighted Iraqis slapping the fallen statue with their shoes went around the world. Kadhim said his story was told to President George W Bush in the Oval Office. But he now wishes he had left his sledgehammer at home. Kadhim, like many Iraqis, blames the invaders for starting a chain of events that destroyed the country. He longs for the certainties and stability of Saddam's time. First, he says, he realised it was not going to be liberation, but occupation. Then he hated the corruption, mismanagement and violence in the new Iraq. Most of all he despises Iraq's new leaders. \\"Saddam has gone, and we have one thousand Saddams now,\\" he says. \\"It wasn't like this under Saddam. There was a system. There were ways. We didn't like him, but he was better than those people.\\" \\"Saddam never executed people without a reason. He was as solid as a wall. There was no corruption or looting, it was safe. You could be safe.\\" Many Iraqis echo that. Saddam's regime was harsh, and it could be murderous. He led the country into a series of disastrous wars and brought crippling international sanctions down on their heads. But with the benefit of 13 years of hindsight, the world that existed before 9 April 2003 seems to be a calmer, more secure place. They have not had a proper day of peace since the old regime fell. As for democracy, many I have spoken to believe the hopelessly sectarian political system is broken. At least, they say, law and order existed under Saddam. Some hoped things might get better after the army's victory over IS in Falluja. The devastating bomb attack in Baghdad in the early hours of Sunday has blasted that hope away. I asked Kadhim he would do if he could meet Tony Blair. \\"I would say to him you are a criminal, and I'd spit in his face.\\" And what would he say to George Bush? \\"I'd say you're criminal too. You killed the children of Iraq. You killed the women and you killed the innocent. I would say the same to Blair. And to the coalition that invaded Iraq. I will say to them you are criminals and you should be brought to justice.\\" A chain of consequences that leads back to the invasion of 2003 caused Iraq's perpetual war. The Americans and Britain removed a hated dictator, and dissolved his army and state. But they had no real plan to rebuild the country they had broken. They improvised - and made matters worse. Jihadists were not in Iraq before the invasion. Shia and Sunni Muslims, whose sectarian civil war started during the occupation, could co-exist. The invaders did not have enough troops to control Iraq. Jihadists poured across open borders. Al-Qaeda established itself here, and eventually was reborn as so-called Islamic State. Iraqis have often made matters worse for themselves, but it was mistakes by the US and Britain that pushed Iraq down the road to catastrophe.

Kadhim, a man from Iraq, helped to knock down a statue of Saddam Hussein when the invasion happened. But now, he feels that things might have been better before.

It instead focuses on the functioning of the current Panama Canal with its locks and Gatun Lake. Allow me to provide you with a more suitable answer: The first canal in the Panama region was actually the failed French attempt to build an interoceanic canal, known as the Panama Canal. This French effort, which began in 1881 under the direction of Ferdinand de Lesseps, was located in the same general area as the current Panama Canal, running from the Atlantic to the Pacific coasts of the Isthmus of Panama. However, the French project failed due to a variety of factors, including tropical diseases, engineering challenges, and financial difficulties. In 1904, the United States took over the project and redesigned the French canal, which led to the construction of the current Panama Canal that opened in 1914. The Panama Canal, as it exists now, runs 50 miles (80 kilometers) across the Isthmus of Panama, connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. It comprises a complex system of locks, including those situated at the Miraflores Locks on the Pacific side and the Gatun Locks on the Atlantic side, which lift and then lower ships to and from the artificial Gatun Lake, elevated 85 feet (26 meters) above sea level. In conclusion, while the provided answer mentioned locks and Gatun Lake, it failed to directly answer the question about the location of the first canal in Panama. The first canal project in Panama was in the same location as the current Panama Canal, but it was not completed and was later replaced by the present-day canal built by the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How to clean a pot after cooking rice?","completion":"To clean a pot after cooking rice, follow these step-by-step instructions to ensure the pot is thoroughly cleaned and ready for its next use. 1. Allow the pot to cool: Before attempting to clean the pot, give it some time to cool down to avoid burning yourself. Wait until the pot has reached a safe temperature to handle. 2. Remove leftover rice: Use a spatula or wooden spoon to scrape out any leftover rice from the pot. This will make the cleaning process easier and prevent food waste. Step 3: Soak the pot in water: Fill the pot with warm water, ensuring that the water covers the bottom and sides where any rice residue may be present. Add a drop or two of mild dish soap for added cleaning power. Allow the pot to soak for about 10 to 15 minutes. This will help to loosen any stuck-on rice and make it easier to remove. Step 4: Use a soft sponge or cloth: Start by gently scrubbing the sides and bottom of the pot with a sponge or cloth. Be careful not to use abrasive materials, such as steel wool, which may scratch the surface. Step 5: Focus on problem areas: If any rice remains stuck to the pot, focus your scrubbing on those areas. Apply a little extra pressure with the sponge or cloth if necessary. If there is still some stubborn residue, you can use a nylon brush or scraper to gently remove it. Step 6: Rinse the pot: Once you have removed all of the rice residue, rinse the pot thoroughly under warm running water. Make sure to remove all soap residue, as it could affect the taste of future dishes. Step 7: Dry the pot: Use a clean, dry towel to dry the pot, or allow it to air dry on a drying rack. Step 8: Inspect the pot: Double-check the pot to make sure there is no remaining rice residue or soap. If any areas still need attention, repeat the appropriate cleaning steps.

A: Aiming to reduce NATO power in the Mediterranean, in 1971 Libya requested that Malta cease to allow NATO to use its land for a military base, in turn offering them foreign aid. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: I apologize for my previous response as it does not correctly answer the question. To address your query, let me provide you with the correct information. Before discussing the number of Italians living in Libya prior to October 1970, it is important to understand the historical context. Italy colonized Libya in 1911 and held control until the end of World War II. During this period, a significant number of Italians moved to Libya as part of the Fascist regime's colonial plans, which included agricultural and infrastructural development. Many Italians ended up settling in Libya, forming an Italian population within the country. The Italian presence in Libya reached its peak during the mid-1930s under Italian leader Benito Mussolini. The number of Italians living in Libya varied during the years, and estimates are not exact. However, it is estimated that around 110,000 to 150,000 Italians lived in Libya by the end of the 1930s, constituting about 12-15% of the total population at the time. After World War II, the situation changed significantly. Italy lost its possessions in North Africa, and by 1951, Libya gained independence under UN administration. Despite this political shift, many Italians remained in Libya, and according to the 1954 Italo-Libyan Treaty, Italians had the right to stay and work there. The Italian population in Libya continued to decline, though, due to several factors, including political and social changes in the newly independent country. By the late 1960s, the number of Italians in Libya was relatively low. However, the specific number of Italians living in Libya right before October 1970 is difficult to determine due to limited data and regional complexities. We can estimate that the Italian population in Libya at that time would have been significantly lower compared to its peak in the 1930s, possibly ranging between 20,000 to 30,000. In 1970, under Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's regime, the Libyan government ordered the expulsion of the remaining Italian population, and their properties were confiscated. This marks the end of the significant Italian presence in Libya."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Please write a short summary for the following article: The Real Mess Behind Mariagate Forgive me for asking, but I was out of the country last week and on the road a day or two back here at home. Do I have this right– Citigroup Chairman Charles Prince Charles Prince , riding hard astride the financial colossus with 140 billion in annual revenue and 1.5 trillion in assets, has just fired a high-roller lieutenant for allegedly having an illicit affair with the Money Honey from CNBC? Of course it doesn’t read quite that way in some financial media, which devoted abundant space to the flap–that would be way too specific and far too difficult to prove–even as they feasted on it on their front pages. But that is precisely what they and the rest of the media are hinting at, in weasly words of innuendo and wimpy off-the-record insinuation. This gossipfest for a pimped-out press likely comes from Citigroup sympathizers–maybe even from in-house leakers. And so publications devote precious column inches in tacit pursuit of trivial trysting that may never have happened–and get diverted from the real story, the far bigger one that actually matters: Citigroup is faltering, Chuck Prince’s power and his reign are at risk, and he has just fired a hitter who was loyal to the man Prince succeeded: the behemoth’s patriarch and architect, Sanford I. Weill. Come to think of it, this sounds like a shrewd crisis-PR strategy. Shame on all of you. In case you missed it: Last week Todd Thomson Todd Thomson , chief of Citigroup’s wealth management unit, got whacked by Prince, officially for excessive spending and such, but unofficially for what one financial newspaper genteely described as “the way that Mr. Thomson managed his friendship with” CNBC anchor Maria Bartiromo. “Managed his friendship”? Cue video of the old Monty Python sketch with Eric Idle elbowing the fellow next to him and asking about sex: “Nudge nudge, snap snap, grin grin, wink wink, say no more?” Never mind that the stock of this financial services laggard has gone up only 12% in three years (while the S&P 500 is up 28%), that Citi ranks a lowly 28th of 42 banks in our own Platinum List performance rankings, and that it routinely trails Bank of America in return on assets. And never mind whether Citigroup, to unlock better value, should undergo a smashup and break itself up entirely or peddle some businesses to private equity buyers. (Sell the credit-card biz! Bail out of consumer banking!) Instead, let’s get the media machine going ’round and ’round over whether Thomson might have scored on the corporate jet. But Citigroup shareholders dont care whether a Citigroup executive might have cheated on his wife, and Citigroup leakers shouldn’t, either. None of this has any bearing on business: It just doesnt matter. What Citigroup shareholders do care about is the stock price and what Prince is doing to lift it–and how he manages the company. And there’s plenty here to warrant concern. We are told Prince sacked his second as a cost-crackdown move because Thomson had a palatial fireplace installed in his office, but one wonders where the chairman was when the jackhammers were grinding away at the start. We are told Prince had warned Thomson to cut back on Maria-time at client functions–yet she adds star power that can make Citi look good in exchange for her access to the bigs in the room. We are told Prince was “jolted” (in the lead of The Wall Street Journal‘s Page One exposé on Jan. 24) by Thomson’s temerity in putting 5 million into a short-run TV series on the Sundance Channel to be hosted by Robert Redford and–omidgod!–the dreaded Bartiromo. Yet five million bucks in a 140 billion company? That is 1.3% of the revenue that Citi brings in–in a single, 24-hour day. Moreover, its a cheap way to align Citi with the greenie movement and host super-rich private banking clients on the film festival circuit. And we are told, as the Journal intoned, with an upraised eyebrow, that Maria Bartiromo and Todd Thomson were “spotted” at the plush eatery Daniel in New York in late 2005, dining alone. “Word of the sighting spread through Citigroup the next day.” Sure it did–the foreign currency traders must have gone wild. Let’s get this right: A journalist working her sources goes out to dinner with a source who runs a big business for a huge company she covers. Isn’t that what journos do all the time? Something odious and sexist and archaic drives these artfully veiled accounts. Bartiromo, who plays it straight and is fiercely committed to her job, would not have been made a target if she weighed 200 pounds and looked like Winston Churchill. And Thomson wouldn’t have gotten pilloried in the press if there weren’t enemies inside or close to Citi feeding off-the-record invective to the writers. Let us get back to business: Citi has 1,000 banking branches in the U.S., while Bank of America has six times as many; it has failed to reap billions in private equity bets the way Goldman Sachs routinely does; and it runs third in credit cards. If the numbers suck when the company reports earnings in coming weeks and quarters, we’ll know the real reason for this brouhaha: Mariagate was a way to distract attention from the real screw-ups at Citigroup itself. Comments are turned off for this post. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the dismissal of Todd Thomson, chief of Citigroup's wealth management unit by Citigroup Chairman Charles Prince. The dismissal is unofficially linked to Thomson's relationship with CNBC anchor Maria Bartiromo, though officially claimed to be for excessive spending. The author argues that the media focus on this potential scandal diverts attention from the real issue: Citigroup's poor performance, with a stock increase of only 12% in three years and a low ranking on the Platinum List performance rankings.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Question: Sometimes people seem like robots, but really we're all just what? Options: - stupid - inhumane - human - dangerous - strange The answer is \\"human\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer is \\"human\\" because, despite our various behaviors and quirks, we are all part of the human species. This means that we share common attributes and characteristics that make us unique from other life forms. People might sometimes seem like robots due to their repetitive actions, routines, or adherence to certain societal norms and expectations. However, it's essential to remember that humans are complex beings with a wide range of emotions, thoughts, and experiences that set us apart from robots or machines. In comparison to the other options provided, \\"human\\" is the most accurate description for the following reasons: 1. \\"Stupid\\" implies a lack of intelligence, which is not true for everyone. Each person has their own set of skills, knowledge, and abilities that contribute to their intelligence in various ways. 2. \\"Inhumane\\" suggests that people are devoid of compassion or empathy, which is also not accurate. While some individuals may exhibit inhumane behavior, many people have the capacity to empathize with, care for, and help others. 3. \\"Dangerous\\" could apply to some individuals, but it is not a defining characteristic of humans as a whole. Although there are people in the world who pose a threat to others, the majority of humans are not inherently dangerous. 4. \\"Strange\\" indicates that people are bizarre or unusual, which might be true for some individuals but does not describe the entire human population. Human behavior can be diverse and intricate, but categorizing everyone as strange would be an oversimplification. In conclusion, while humans may exhibit a wide range of behaviors, we are all part of the same species, which sets us apart from robots or other life forms. Recognizing our shared humanity can help us better appreciate and understand one another's individual differences, broadening our perspective on the world around us."},{"prompt":"Q: I have waited tables, but before that, our friend group were regulars at several local “open all night” establishments.

Answer choices: - water conservation - Veins and arteries. - hydrogen and oxygen - Animal survival - to move people - heat energy - heating liquids - sailplanes to fly The answer to this question is:","completion":"Sailplanes to fly. High pressure systems play a crucial role in allowing sailplanes to soar. A high pressure system is an area where the atmospheric pressure is higher than the surrounding area. This generally leads to stable atmospheric conditions with little turbulence or strong weather disturbances. In turn, this creates a conducive environment for uplift and thermals, which are essential for sailplane flights. Thermals are columns of rising warm air that form when the sun heats the ground, causing localized heating of the air near the surface. This warm air then rises vertically, creating an updraft that sailplanes can use to gain altitude without the need for an engine. The presence of high pressure systems increases the likelihood of thermals forming, as the stable atmosphere helps to preserve and enhance these rising air columns. Not only do high pressure systems provide the necessary uplift for sailplanes, but they also contribute to clear and sunny weather conditions. Visibility is critically important for glider pilots, as it enables them to identify thermals and navigate effectively. Therefore, high pressure systems support sailplane flights by providing flight-friendly weather conditions that include thermals, reduced turbulence, and clear skies. While the presence of a high pressure system mainly benefits sailplanes in terms of flight, other options mentioned in the question are not directly influenced by high pressure systems. For instance, water conservation, veins and arteries, hydrogen and oxygen, animal survival, moving people, heat energy, and heating liquids are related to different aspects of nature and science, but they do not play a significant role in allowing sailplanes to fly. In summary, high pressure systems allow sailplanes to fly by providing optimal weather conditions that include stable atmospheric conditions, uplift support from thermals, and clear visibility for navigation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: almost every day i uh this spring has been uh a little hard to keep up the pace because uh we've had a lot of family activities my wife has taken up skiing Hypothesis: This spring was difficult to keep pace with everything going on. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. The statement provided - \\"almost every day this spring has been a little hard to keep up the pace because we've had a lot of family activities\\" - indicates that the individual has found it challenging to maintain their usual pace and stay on top of things during this spring season. This difficulty in keeping up with daily life is primarily attributed to the significant number of family activities taking place, further supported by the subsequent mention of the wife taking up skiing. The hypothesis - \\"This spring was difficult to keep pace with everything going on\\" - is essentially a rephrasing of the premise, with slight modifications, but it still conveys the same idea. Both statements imply that the person has found it tough to manage their time and personal life due to the increase in family activities and responsibilities during this spring.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"If there are more plant roots growing near or on rocks, it will have a more significant impact on soil erosion. This is due to the interconnected nature of the processes involved in soil erosion and the role that plant roots play in these processes. The supposed perturbation in this scenario is directly impacting a step of the process. When plant roots grow near or on rocks, they exert pressure on the rock, causing it to break apart. Simultaneously, the roots release acids that dissolve parts of the rock, further breaking it down. Over time, the rocks are broken into smaller and smaller pieces, which then become more susceptible to erosion. Erosion occurs when wind, water, or other forces remove and transport these tiny rock fragments away from their original location. As more plant roots grow on and near rocks, they will have a direct impact on the first step and second steps of the processes mentioned above, which lead to soil erosion. These steps include the breaking apart of rocks and dissolving parts of the rock through the release of plant acids. Since the roots are directly affecting these steps, they are accelerating the rate at which rocks break down, creating more soil and rock particles that are vulnerable to erosion. An indirect impact on the process might include factors such as climate changes that influence plant growth or forces like wind or water that influence erosion by transporting particles away. However, the direct impact of more plant roots on the process is increasing the rate of rock breakdown and dissolution, thereby accelerating the natural process of soil erosion. In conclusion, the presence of more plant roots directly impacts the steps in the process that lead to soil erosion, specifically the initial breaking apart of rocks and the dissolution of rock material by plant acids. This direct impact increases the chances of soil erosion, as more broken rocks and soil materials become exposed and susceptible to forces like wind, water, and other elements responsible for erosion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He treated his wife for an electrical burn and luckily had gauze not just a band-aid as the Select from: [1]. band-aid was preferred for this kind of injury.. [2]. gauze was preferred for this kind of injury.. Answer:","completion":"2. gauze was preferred for this kind of injury. He treated his wife for an electrical burn and luckily had gauze not just a band-aid as the gauze was preferred for this kind of injury. In cases of electrical burns, using gauze provides a more comprehensive solution for wound management and promotes a better healing environment. It is crucial to handle such burns with utmost care to prevent complications and ensure a healthy recovery. To begin the treatment process, the husband first needed to separate his wife from the source of the electric current or shut off the power supply to avoid further injury. Once the victim was no longer in contact with the electrical source, he carefully assessed the severity of the burn and took vital signs such as pulse, heart rate, and temperature. As electrical burns often cause both external and internal injuries, it was essential for the husband to remain vigilant and provide a thorough examination. Having established that immediate medical attention was not required, he gently cleansed the wound with mild soap and warm water to remove dirt and bacteria. The husband then carefully patted the area dry using a sterile cloth or gauze to avoid aggravating the injury further. Gauze is the preferred choice for treating electrical burns, as it offers several advantages over traditional adhesive bandages like band-aids. Gauze is thinner and more flexible, which allows it to provide more substantial coverage on irregularly shaped burns. Additionally, gauze can be layered and wrapped freely around the affected area, creating a snug yet nonrestrictive fit that is less likely to interfere with circulation as the wound heals. Before applying the sterile gauze to the electrical burn, the husband applied a soothing burn ointment which acted as a protective barrier, reducing the risk of infection and aiding in the healing process. Next, he carefully wrapped the gauze around the burned area, ensuring that it fully covered the wound without being too tight or causing discomfort. To further protect the wound from possible infections, the husband secured the gauze with medical tape, taking care not to place the tape directly on the burn as it could cause irritation. The gauze would need to be changed daily, and the wound site monitored closely for any signs of infection or complications. In treating electrical burns, gauze provides both an effective barrier against contaminants and a gentle means of securing the burn ointment to the affected area. Thanks to the husband's quick thinking and appropriate choice of wound care materials, his wife's wound could now begin the healing process, overall reducing the risk of subsequent complications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What were the last names of the three people who played little part in the general life of the camp? Bartlett's decision to deposit stores on the ice ensured that an ice camp, known as \\"Shipwreck Camp\\", was more or less established by the time Karluk sank. Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided \\"substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time.\\" Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.Amid this activity Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible. Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island. A party of four, led by Karluk's first officer Alexander Anderson and including crew members Charles Barker, John Brady and Edmund Golightly, left Shipwreck Camp on 21 January with instructions from Bartlett to establish their camp at or near Berry Point on the north shore of Wrangel Island. On 4 February Bjarne Mamen, who accompanied the party as a scout, returned to Shipwreck Camp and reported that he had left the group a few miles short of land that was evidently not Wrangel Island, and was probably Herald Island, 38 miles (61 km) from their intended destination.

Write an article based on this summary: – Sorry to burst your bubble, but whatever bargain you scored on Black Friday pales in comparison to the deal a man got when he purchased a storage unit in Southern California in October. It's a tale conveyed by Dan Dotson of A&E's Storage Wars, who was the one who actually sold the unit for 500 through his company American Auctioneers, and who learned what happened next when a woman came up to him at a Nov. 1 charity event. \\"She said, 'I just gotta tell you this story, my husband works for a guy that bought a unit from you and there was a safe in there,'\\" Dotson recounts to the Desert Sun. Inside the safe was cash—7.5 million of it. In a YouTube video in which he explains the story (the original auction wasn't recorded for A&E), he says that when the storage unit's original owners found out it had been sold they reached out to the new owners via a lawyer to make a deal to get their money back, making an initial offer of 600,000. They ended up letting the new owner keep 1.2 million. People does the simple math: that's 1,199,500 \\"in profit on a measly 500 investment.\\" (Another couple recently made a million-dollar discovery.)","completion":"Title: The Ultimate Storage Unit Find: A Treasure Worth Millions Introduction Imagine paying 500 for a storage unit, only to find that it holds a safe containing a whopping 7.5 million in cash. That's exactly what happened to a lucky man in Southern California in October. Often, Black Friday is talked about as a day when shoppers can score the best deals. However, nothing can surpass this ultimate deal discovered during a storage unit auction. The story unfolds as Dan Dotson, a prominent figure from A&E's Storage Wars, narrates the jaw-dropping series of events. Purchase of the Storage Unit and the Discovery In October, a man purchased a storage unit in Southern California for 500, a transaction facilitated through Dan Dotson's company, American Auctioneers. Little did he know, his life was about to change dramatically. Inside the unit, he discovered a safe containing an astonishing sum of 7.5 million in cold hard cash. It wasn't until a charity event on November 1st that the incredible story reached Dan Dotson. A woman approached him, eager to share the tale as her husband worked for the man who had made the life-altering purchase. Dan Dotson, understandably, was just as surprised by the news as the lucky buyer must have been. He proceeded to share the story in a YouTube video, as it hadn't been captured on camera for the A&E show. The Original Owners' Offer for the Money When the original owners of the storage unit realized that they had lost access to the safe and the millions of dollars inside, panic set in. They contacted a lawyer who reached out to the new owner, hoping to strike a deal and recover their lost money. Initially, they offered 600,000 to the new owner as compensation. However, after negotiations, it was ultimately settled that the new owner could keep a staggering 1.2 million, while the original owners received the remaining 6.3 million. A Profitable Deal, Indeed This million-dollar luck by the man only proves that it undoubtedly was one of the most profitable investments one could make. People magazine did the math: a profit of 1,199,500 on a mere 500 investment. It's a lucky break most of us can only dream about. Conclusion In the world of storage unit auctions, there's always the potential for discovering hidden treasures. The Southern California man's life-changing find of 7.5 million in cash certainly sets the bar high for what can be considered a great deal. This remarkable story not only enthralls those involved in the storage unit auctions world but also drives home that, sometimes, reality can truly be stranger – and infinitely more fascinating – than fiction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: U.S. President Donald Trump is sending a 4.4 trillion budget request to Congress that includes money for a southern border wall and building up the military, but is projected to increase the federal deficit by more than 1 trillion. White House officials all but acknowledged the proposal unveiled Monday has little chance of becoming law — Congress alone controls federal government spending. But the White House insisted the budget proposal still sends an important message about Trump's priorities. \\"This is a messaging document,\\" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters at a briefing Monday. The Trump budget calls for major cuts to domestic programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. But the plan would still not balance the federal budget, in part because of reduced federal revenue due to tax cuts passed last year. Democrats widely rejected the plan. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the proposal a \\"brutal collection of broken promises and staggering cuts.\\" The proposal's failure to eliminate debt is also likely to upset some Republicans, who have traditionally opposed budget deficits. \\"It's simply adjusting to the Washington, D.C., we live in,\\" Mulvaney said, stressing that the new budget plan would help \\"turn the tide\\" on national debt. The White House proposal builds on the massive, two-year spending bill passed last week by Congress and signed by the president. That bill includes a major boost for the military, as well as domestic programs. Mulvaney, a former lawmaker and long-time opponent of federal debt, has acknowledged he likely would not have supported the bill were he still in Congress. But he said the new White House proposal does not mean that all of the money approved by Congress must be spent. \\"These are spending caps, these are not spending floors,\\" he said. Under the two-year budget deal reached last week by Congress, the Pentagon will get a record-high 700 billion for 2018 — fulfilling a Trump campaign pledge. \\"We took care of the military like it's never...

Background: Brock Edward Lesnar was born on July 12, 1977 in Webster, South Dakota, the son of Stephanie and Richard Lesnar, and grew up on his parents' dairy farm in Webster. He is of German descent. He has two older brothers, Troy and Chad, and a younger sister, Brandi. At age 17, Lesnar joined the Army National Guard, where he was assigned to an office job after his red-green colorblindness was deemed hazardous to his desire to work with explosives. Context: After his match at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, Lesnar sidelined his career in WWE to pursue a career in the National Football League (NFL) despite not playing American football since high school. The WWE issued this statement on their official website, WWE.com, following his departure: Brock Lesnar has made a personal decision to put his WWE career on hold to prepare to tryout for the National Football League this season. Brock has wrestled his entire professional career in the WWE and we are proud of his accomplishments and wish him the best in his new endeavor. Lesnar later told a Minnesota radio show that he had \\"three wonderful years\\" in WWE, but had grown unhappy and always wanted to play professional football, adding that he did not want to be 40 years old and wondering if he could have \\"made it\\" in football. In an interview about the NFL, he stated: This is no load of bull; it's no WWE stunt. I am dead serious about this. I ain't afraid of anything and I ain't afraid of anybody. I've been an underdog in athletics since I was five. I got zero college offers for wrestling. Now people say I can't play football, that it's a joke. I say I can. I'm as good an athlete as a lot of guys in the NFL, if not better. I've always had to fight for everything. I wasn't the best technician in amateur wrestling but I was strong, had great conditioning, and a hard head. Nobody could break me. As long as I have that, I don't give a damn what anybody else thinks. Lesnar had a great showing at the NFL Combine, but on April 17 a minivan collided with his motorbike and he suffered a broken jaw and left hand, a bruised pelvis and a pulled groin. Several NFL teams expressed interest in watching Lesnar work out. The Minnesota Vikings worked out Lesnar on June 11, but he was hampered by the groin injury suffered in the April motorcycle accident. On July 24 it was reported that he was nearly recovered from his groin injury. He signed with the Vikings on July 27 and played in several preseason games for the team. He was released by the Vikings on August 30. Lesnar received an invitation to play as a representative for the Vikings in NFL Europa, but declined due to his desire to stay in the United States with his family.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Alvin York (Gary Cooper), a poor young Tennessee hillbilly, is an exceptional marksman, but a ne'er-do-well prone to drinking and fighting, which does not make things any easier for his patient mother (Margaret Wycherly). He changes when he meets winsome Gracie Williams (Joan Leslie), and works night and day at strenuous odd jobs to accumulate the payment for a certain good farm so she'll marry him. On the very day payment is due, he wins the final needed amount at a target-shooting contest, but on being told that the farm has just been sold to his romantic rival, he returns to his dissolute ways. Late that night, he is struck by lightning during a rainstorm while en route to attack the man who had cheated him. Finding himself outside the meeting house where a revival is going, he goes in and undergoes a religious awakening and vows never to get angry at anyone ever again. He makes amends with the men who cheated him out of the land, and tries to with Gracie. When the U.S. declares war in World War I, York tries to avoid induction into the Army as a conscientious objector because of his religious beliefs, but is drafted nonetheless. His status as a conscientious objector is rejected since his church has no official standing, and he reluctantly reports to Camp Gordon for basic training. His superiors discover that he is a phenomenal marksman and decide to promote him to corporal. York still wants nothing to do with the Army and killing. Major Buxton (Stanley Ridges), his sympathetic commanding officer, tries to change York's mind, citing sacrifices made by others all throughout the history of the United States. He gives York a leave to go home and think it over. He promises York a recommendation for his exemption as a conscientious objector if York remains unconvinced. While York is fasting and pondering, the wind blows his Bible open to the verse \\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.\\" York reports back for duty and tells his superiors that he can... A:","completion":"In the movie plot, \\"Alvin York\\" portrays several significant developments within the protagonist's character and his relationship with others and his beliefs. It also provides an intriguing blend of a romantic story, spiritual transformation, and heroic acts during World War I.

What is the name for the branch of astronomy that relates to precise measurements and explanations of the positions and movements of celestial bodies? What is the answer?","completion":"The branch of astronomy that relates to precise measurements and explanations of the positions and movements of celestial bodies is called Astrometry. Astrometry is a critical field in astronomy, as it provides essential information for various astronomical studies. Astrometry is an ancient discipline that has been practiced for thousands of years, with early observations recorded by ancient civilizations such as the Babylonians, the Chinese, and the Maya. Modern astrometry, however, started in the 17th century with the introduction of telescopic observations and more precise measurements. The primary goals of astrometry are to accurately measure the positions, distances, and movements of celestial objects such as stars, planets, and other astronomical phenomena. These measurements are essential for increasing our understanding of the universe's structure, the behaviors of celestial objects, and the underpinning physical laws that drive their motions. There are several important techniques in astrometry, including: 1. Positional astrometry: This involves the precise measurement of the angular positions of celestial objects on the celestial sphere. The data obtained from these measurements are often used to create stellar catalogs, which list positions and other properties of stars. 2. Parallax measurements: Parallax is the apparent change in the position of an object due to a change in the observer's position. By observing the parallax of stars, astronomers can calculate their distances from Earth, which helps in understanding the scale and structure of the universe. 3. Proper motion measurements: Proper motion is the apparent motion of a celestial object across the sky over time relative to distant background stars. By measuring the proper motion of stars, astronomers can study the kinematics and dynamics of our galaxy and determine the orbits of stars and other celestial bodies. 4. Radial velocity measurements: Radial velocity is the change in distance of a celestial object along the line of sight of the observer. By measuring the radial velocities of stars and other celestial objects, astronomers can investigate the motion of objects within the galaxy and the presence of exoplanets around other stars. Astrometry also plays a critical role in other astronomical studies, such as the determination of the celestial reference frame, which is a coordinate system for precisely defining the positions of celestial objects. Additionally, it contributes to fields like celestial mechanics, the study of the motion of celestial objects influenced by gravity and other forces, and astrodynamics, which is the application of celestial mechanics to the practical problems of space travel, spacecraft navigation, and mission planning. In summary, astrometry is the branch of astronomy that focuses on the precise measurements and explanations of the positions and movements of celestial bodies. It is a fundamental branch of astronomy that provides essential data and knowledge for a variety of astronomical studies, enabling a deeper understanding of our universe's composition, structure, and behaviors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Background: Stanley Donen ( DAWN-@n; born April 13, 1924) is an American film director and choreographer whose most celebrated works are Singin' in the Rain and On the Town, both of which he co-directed with actor and dancer Gene Kelly. Other noteworthy films include Royal Wedding, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Funny Face, Indiscreet, Damn Yankees!, Charade, and Two for the Road. He began his career in the chorus line on Broadway for director George Abbott, where he befriended Kelly. Context: After the success of Take Me Out to the Ball Game, Freed gave Donen and Kelly the chance to direct On the Town, released in 1949. The film was an adaptation of the Betty Comden and Adolph Green Broadway musical about sailors on leave in New York City and was the first musical to be filmed on location. Donen and Kelly had wanted to shoot the entire film in New York, but Freed would only allow them to spend one week away from the studio. That week produced the film's famous opening number New York, New York. Away from both studio interference and sound stage constrictions, Donen and cinematographer Harold Rosson shot a scene on the streets of New York City that pioneered many cinematic techniques that would not be used again until they were popularized by the French New Wave ten years later. These techniques included spatial jump cuts, 360-degree pans, hidden cameras, abrupt changes of screen direction and non-professional actors. Donen's biographer Joseph A. Casper stated that the scene avoids being gratuitous or amateurish, while still \\"developing plot, describing the setting while conveying its galvanizing atmosphere and manic mood, introducing and delineating character.\\" Casper also said that \\"Today the film is regarded as a turning point: the first bona fide musical that moved dance, as well as the musical genre, out of the theater and captured it with and for film rather than on film; the first to make the city an important character; and the first to abandon the chorus.\\" On the Town starred Kelly, Sinatra and Munshin as three sailors on a 24-hour shore leave in New York whose romantic pursuits lead them to Ann Miller, Betty Garrett and Vera-Ellen. The film was a success both financially and critically. It won the Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture and screenwriters Comden and Green won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. Like Orson Welles, Donen made his directorial debut at 25. Donen stated that Kelly was \\"responsible for most of the dance movements. I was behind the camera in the dramatic and musical sequences.\\" Kelly believed that he and Donen \\"were a good team. I thought we complemented each other very well.\\" Question: What happens to the sailors in the movie?.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: What is the first name of the oldest Darling child? john A:","completion":"Title: \\"The Enigmatic Adventures of John Darling\\" In the quiet, idyllic town of Everdale, John Darling is the oldest among the three Darling children. He leads a rather ordinary life with his siblings, Michael and Wendy, and their loving parents, Mary and George. However, as John approaches his 18th birthday, he discovers a hidden, cryptic letter in the attic written by his long-lost great-grandfather. The letter is filled with mysterious clues and hints, which spark a burning curiosity in John. Fueled by the desire to know the truth, he embarks on an incredible journey to uncover his family's secret past with the help of his siblings and their childhood friend Lily. The quartet's journey takes them to the farthest corners of the world, filled with unforgettable encounters and close calls with dangerous adversaries who are seemingly aware of their quest and try to stop them. As they experience a whirlwind of emotion— from excitement and fear to love and self-discovery— John deciphers the complex web of riddles, which holds the key to his family's extraordinary legacy. As the adventure unfolds, John learns that his great-grandfather was a legendary explorer who discovered an ancient, hidden world filled with mystical treasures and powerful artifacts. The letters and clues were intentionally left behind as a test to see if John is worthy of inheriting this long-forgotten world and carrying on his great-grandfather's legacy. In a breathtaking finale, John and his friends overcome the final challenges that stand in their way, including confronting a shadowy organization that wants the ancient world for themselves. They eventually claim the hidden world as their own, promising to protect and preserve it for future generations. In the end, John Darling emerges not just as the oldest Darling child, but as a true hero. The experiences he gained throughout his journey have transformed him into a mature, wise, and fearless guardian of his great-grandfather's legacy, ready to face whatever other adventures life may have in store. The story serves as a beautiful testament to the power of family, friendship, and the human spirit to conquer the unknown."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Born on December 17, 1944, in Manchester, England, Hill has had a prolific acting career spanning several decades. He has appeared in numerous film, television, and theater productions, showcasing his versatility and talent. Before gaining worldwide recognition for his role in Titanic, Hill was already an accomplished actor. He started his career in the late 1970s with appearances in various British television series, including I Claudius (1976), Fox (1980), and Boys from the Blackstuff (1982). In the latter series, he played Yosser Hughes, which remains a critically acclaimed portrayal. Hill's film career began with Gandhi in 1982, followed by roles in other films, such as No Surrender (1985), Drowning by Numbers (1988), and The Ghost and the Darkness (1996). In Titanic, Bernard Hill's performance as Captain Smith garnered much attention and praise as he effectively captured the character's sense of duty, responsibility, and ultimately, the tragedy that unfolded. Hill's portrayal of Captain Smith highlighted the moral dilemmas and internal conflicts faced by the captain as he grapples with the impending disaster and the fate of the passengers and crew. This role contributed significantly to Hill's international recognition. Hill's career continued to flourish after Titanic, with notable performances in several successful films. A few of these projects include The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (2001-2003), where he portrayed King Théoden of Rohan; The Scorpion King (2002); and Valkyrie (2008), starring Tom Cruise. Bernard Hill's continued success and dedication to his craft have established him as a respected and admired actor within the industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: what ion drives the membrane potential back to resting membrane potential (repolarization)?? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the context of the question The question is about the ion that drives the membrane potential back to its resting state, also known as repolarization. This process occurs in the context of nerve cells (neurons) and electric signals (action potentials) that they transmit. Step 2: Recall relevant concepts In order to answer the question, we need to recall the key concepts related to membrane potential, depolarization, and repolarization. These concepts are: 1. Resting membrane potential: The difference in voltage across the plasma membrane of a neuron when it is at rest (not transmitting signals). It is typically around -70 mV. 2. Depolarization: The temporary increase in membrane potential, making the neuron less polarized or more positive, due to an influx of positively charged ions (mainly sodium ions, Na+) through voltage-gated ion channels. 3. Repolarization: The process whereby the membrane potential returns to its resting state after depolarization, due to the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels. Step 3: Identify the ion responsible for repolarization With the knowledge of the concepts mentioned in step 2, we can now identify the ion responsible for repolarization. Since repolarization is driven by the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels, it is the potassium ion (K+) that drives the membrane potential back to the resting membrane potential. Answer: The ion that drives the membrane potential back to resting membrane potential (repolarization) is the potassium ion (K+)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

There are two dairy farms in the town of Milkton and both are about the same size. Farm A produces only organic milk. Farm B does not but they are considering switching production to organic milk. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm likely has higher milk yields, farm A or B? A:","completion":"To answer this question, we need to consider the differences in production methods between organic and non-organic dairy farms. Step 1: Understand the differences in production methods Organic dairy farms, like farm A, avoid the use of synthetic chemicals, antibiotics, GMOs, and growth hormones. They also have stricter animal welfare regulations and often require the cows to have more access to pasture. Non-organic dairy farms, like farm B, may use antibiotics, growth hormones, GMOs, and more conventional feed sources to optimize milk production. Step 2: Determine how these production methods might affect milk yields Antibiotics and growth hormones potentially can lead to increased milk yields in non-organic dairy farms. Non-organic farms may be more likely to optimize their feed and overall cow management for milk production. Organic farms, with their focus on natural practices, might prioritize cow health and welfare more than maximizing milk yields. Step 3: Make a conclusion based on the information provided Based on the differences in production methods and practices, it is likely that farm B, the non-organic dairy farm, would have higher milk yields than farm A, the organic dairy farm. This is because the techniques and management practices used in non-organic farming can lead to increased milk production compared to the more natural and restricted practices in organic farming."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is a news article: What man that you have heard or read about, living today in any part of the world, do you admire most? And who is your second choice? ||||| Sixth year in a row for Obama, 12th straight year for Clinton PRINCETON, NJ -- For the sixth consecutive year, Barack Obama ranks as the Most Admired Man among Americans, and Hillary Clinton is again the Most Admired Woman. Both won by comfortable margins. Sixteen percent named Obama, compared with 4% each for former President George W. Bush and Pope Francis; Clinton (15%) finished ahead of television personality Oprah Winfrey (6%), first lady Michelle Obama (5%), and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (5%). Each year, Gallup asks Americans to name, in an open-ended format, the man and woman living anywhere in the world they admire most. This year's poll was conducted Dec. 5-8. Obama has won Gallup's Most Admired Man designation each year since 2008, the year he was elected president. However, similar to his declining job approval rating this year, the percentage naming him fell to 16% from 30% in 2012. The remainder of the top 10 Most Admired men includes three former presidents (Bush, Bill Clinton, and Jimmy Carter) and two religious leaders (the Rev. Billy Graham and Pope Francis). The sitting pope has finished in the top 10 each year since 1977. In addition to Pope Francis, actor, director, and political activist Clint Eastwood and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz finished in the top 10 for the first time. This year's poll was conducted at the time of South African human rights leader Nelson Mandela's death. The widespread news coverage of his death helped make him top of mind for many Americans, and 7% named him as Most Admired Man. However, because the question wording specifically asks for the name of a living man or woman, Gallup does not rank deceased figures who are mentioned. Hillary Clinton has been named Most Admired Woman a total of 18 times, more than any other woman in Gallup's history, including each of the last 12 years. Clinton first won the distinction in 1993, when she was first lady, and has continued to rank at or near the top of the list while serving in a variety of public roles including as U.S. senator and as secretary of state. The 15% naming her this year is down from 21% last year and is the lowest figure for her since 2006. The top 10 Most Admired Woman list includes several political leaders such as Clinton, Palin, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as humanitarian activists such as Winfrey, Malala Yousafzai (the Pakistani girl shot for trying to attend school), and Angelina Jolie. The queen of England and her granddaughter-in-law, Duchess Kate, also finished among the leading women. All of the women ranking in the top 10 have previously appeared on the list. Graham, Queen Elizabeth II Extend Records for Top 10 Finishes Graham has appeared in the top 10 list far more often than any other man, making his 57th appearance this year. He has never finished first, a spot typically taken by the sitting president, but has finished second on numerous occasions. Ronald Reagan has the second most top 10 finishes, but his 31 such finishes are 26 fewer than Graham's. Carter's 28th top 10 finish this year moved him ahead of former Pope John Paul II for the third most top 10 appearances. Bill Clinton's 22nd top 10 spot ranks him fifth, now ahead of Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon. Mandela frequently finished among the top 10, making his 20th and final top 10 appearance last year. Gallup first asked Americans to name the Most Admired Woman in 1948. That year, Princess Elizabeth of England finished seventh. More than 60 years later, the now queen of England has finished in the top 10 a total of 46 times. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who died earlier this year, has the second most top 10 finishes among women, with 34. Former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis ranks third, followed by Winfrey and Clinton. Implications Clinton was named the Most Admired Woman this year for the 18th time. Unlike this year, each prior time she won she held an official government role. Her public service may not be complete, though, as she is frequently mentioned as a possible contender for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, and likely would be the clear front-runner if she decided to pursue it. She has dominated the Most Admired Woman list since becoming first lady in 1993, failing to finish first only in 1995 and 1996 to Mother Teresa, and in 2001 to Laura Bush. It would not be surprising for Obama to continue to rank as the Most Admired Man for the duration of his presidency, as the sitting president has won the distinction 57 times in the 67 years the question has been asked, including the last 33 in a row. Given his relative youth at age 52, the esteem in which Americans hold former presidents, and his historical significance as the first African-American president, should he live a long life he likely will also rank among the men with the most top 10 appearances for all time. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were named the Most Admired Man and Woman among Americans for the sixth consecutive year according to a Gallup poll conducted in December 2013. Obama received 16% of the votes, while Clinton had 15%. The sitting US president typically takes the top position for Most Admired Man. Clinton has won the Most Admired Woman title 18 times, which is the most for any woman in the Gallup poll's history. Factors such as public roles and possible future political pursuits contribute to their continued admiration among Americans."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

It tells us that there is a significant gathering of people at a swap meet, and this particular event is taking place in a parking lot. Swap meets, also known as flea markets or bazaars, are typically events where people come to buy, sell, or exchange goods and items, often of a used or antique nature.

Therefore, that food is connected with illness is not a new discovery. In 1940's scientists realized that nitrates , which are often used to keep color1 of meat, and other additives caused cancer. However these additives remain in our food and it becomes more difficult to know which additives are helpful or harmful. Farmers sometimes give drugs to animals not because the animals are ill but because they want to sell the animals at higher prices. For example, farmers try hard to make animals grow big so that they can sell the big animals for more money. Although the Food and Drug Administration has tried again and again to control farmers to do so, farmers go on doing this. Question: What are nitrates used for? - They keep flavor of food. - They keep the color1 of meat. - They keep food fresh. - They make animals fatter.

Trivia question: In Norse mythology what is the name of the hall to which the Valkyrie take their chosen warriors? And the answer is?","completion":"In Norse mythology, the hall to which the Valkyries bring their chosen warriors is called Valhalla. Valhalla, meaning \\"hall of the slain,\\" is an enormous and majestic hall located in Asgard, the realm of the gods. It is primarily associated with the Norse god Odin, the All-Father, who rules over Asgard and is known for his wisdom, war abilities, and interest in the souls of heroic warriors who perish in battle. The Valkyries, a group of fierce female warriors, serve Odin and are responsible for selecting the bravest fallen warriors, known as the Einherjar. Upon their arrival in Valhalla, the chosen warriors are welcomed with great feasts and can partake in battle during the day if they so choose. They continue the cycle of fighting and feasting until the onset of Ragnarök, the end of the world, according to Norse mythology. When Ragnarök occurs, these legendary warriors will be summoned by Odin to join the gods in the final battle against the destructive forces and monstrous creatures determined to destroy the cosmos. As a central aspect of the Norse afterlife for warriors, Valhalla is held in high esteem. It is a symbol of honor and courage, as only exceptionally brave and skilled warriors are considered worthy of joining Odin and the Einherjar in this glorious afterworld. By selecting only the greatest warriors for Valhalla, Odin demonstrates his commitment to rewarding valor in battle and ensuring that this essential component of Norse culture remains alive beyond the mortal world. This belief in an extraordinary afterlife continues to captivate historians, scholars, and enthusiasts of Norse mythology, and it serves as a testament to the importance placed on the warrior ethos within this mesmerizing ancient society."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I was sold on the life-time warranty-after all, if a company is willing to replace a hose years after purchase it's got to be good, right? Wrong. The moment i connected the hose and turned the water on i got sprayed from head to toe with a rather strong stream of water coming from a sizable hole in the welded (or shall i say unwelded?) part of the connector. After i mopped myself up i examined the hose and found that the connector had 4 small pinholes along the seam.After having to empty a 100-ft hose, roll it up and ship it back to Amazon i e-mailed Gilmour to express my disappointment. Not surprisingly my e-mail was completely ignored. I have a 7-dollar hose bought on clearance at Rite Aid that's held up great for the last 6 years withou the need for life-time warranty. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? The answer to this question is:","completion":"This product review conveys a negative sentiment. The review starts with a clear statement of dissatisfaction: \\"Very disappointing experience with a poor quality product.\\" The customer was initially attracted by the lifetime warranty but found the promise misleading once they encountered the faulty product. The two main issues which led to the negative sentiment were the product's quality and the company's customer service, both of which let the reviewer down. Firstly, the hose was of poor quality. Upon first use, the reviewer was sprayed with water from a sizable hole in the connector. Further inspection found 4 additional pinholes, heavily implying the product was not checked for defects before shipping. This clearly left the customer frustrated, especially considering they had to go through the hassle of emptying the hose, rolling it up and returning it. Secondly, their dissatisfaction was exacerbated by the company's lack of customer service. The customer's email expressing their disappointment was ignored by Gilmour, the company responsible for the product. This inaction further harmed the company's reputation in the eyes of the reviewer. Their dissatisfaction is further emphasized by comparing the defective hose to a 7 hose bought on clearance which has served them well for the past 6 years. The reviewer ends on a further negative note by casting doubt on the reality of the \\"lifetime warranty.\\" Considering the multiple glaring issues cited by the customer, both regarding the tangible product and intangible service, it is safe to conclude that this product review is heavily negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose third Benhardt play was La Tosca? from the following article ? The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti. Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini. One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand... Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person whose third Bernhardt play was La Tosca is Sardou. Victorien Sardou was a French playwright who wrote a series of historical melodramas, including La Tosca, in collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt. La Tosca, which premiered on 24 November 1887, achieved outstanding success and was eventually adapted into Puccini's opera."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options: (I) negative (II) positive","completion":"The sentiment of the given tweet can be described as a subtle blend of positive and negative emotions, making it difficult to categorize in either option I (negative) or option II (positive) exclusively. The context of the tweet seems to be the differences in the weather or the atmosphere related to the geographical location of the person. Such a response to someone who might be expressing enjoyment of warm summer weather suggests that the speaker isn't experiencing that pleasant warmth in their location, which gives the tweet a slightly negative undertone. However, the tone of the tweet also presents some positive aspects. By using a casual, conversational tone and an exclamation mark, the tweet signifies a light-hearted, friendly rapport. The use of \\"yeah\\" and \\"maybe\\" in the message may also imply that the speaker isn't rejecting the other person's statement outright but is instead acknowledging its subjectivity. In conclusion, the sentiment of the tweet cannot be definitively categorized as either negative or positive based on the presented options.

Question: What preposition do you use if you want to combine two words? Options: A. article B. adjective C. interjection D. conjunction E. pronoun Answer:","completion":"The correct option to pick if you want to combine two words using a preposition is D. conjunction. A conjunction is a part of speech that connects words, phrases, or clauses. It is used to coordinate and connect sentences or words smoothly, making the overall structure more comprehensible. Common examples of conjunctions include 'and', 'but', 'or', 'so', and 'yet'. They provide a relationship between ideas, making the text more coherent. Here's a brief description of the other options mentioned: A. Article: An article is a word used to modify or specify a noun. There are definite articles, such as \\"the\\", and indefinite articles, such as \\"a\\" or \\"an\\". Articles do not combine words; instead, they enable the reader to identify specific or unspecific nouns. B. Adjective: An adjective is a word that describes or modifies a noun. It provides additional information, such as color, size, or quantity, about the noun. Adjectives do not combine words; instead, they add details to make descriptions richer and more vivid. C. Interjection: An interjection is a short exclamation or utterance used to express emotion or reaction. These words usually stand alone and are not used to combine words or phrases. Examples include \\"Wow!\\", \\"Oh no!\\", and \\"Ugh!\\". E. Pronoun: A pronoun is a part of speech that replaces a noun in a sentence to prevent repetition of the noun and to simplify language. Examples of pronouns include 'he', 'she', 'it', 'they', 'we', and 'I'. While pronouns make sentences clearer and less repetitive, they do not function to combine words. In summary, the best option for combining two words using a preposition would be the conjunction, which enables a smooth connection between words, phrases, or clauses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Why wearable technology is the future of sex The network connects toys by accessing their existing technology (machine feedback, pressure sensors, clench and ripple attachments, vibration motors, etc) to give a simulated version of intimate acts from a distance. The founder (known only as Seth) claims the technology can ”honestly, no joke, change the world. It feels like the act of sex,” he told the Daily Mail. “While you're thrusting, I'm being penetrated. You're pushing back. I'm feeling the resistance.\\" And if that doesn't get you jumping straight in to a cold shower, check this out: Frixion should soon be hosting live mass cyber sessions, led by one ringmaster controlling thousands of people's devices with their movements. You could soon be having pseudo-sex with a porn star, if that's what toots your horn. Google Glass it aint. But then again, Google's optical head-mounted device has implications for your sex life, too, in the form of Glance, an app which allows users to experience sex from their partner's point of view. Yep, you'll soon be able to watch yourself having sex, in real-time. And you thought a “selfie stick” was bad. Elsewhere, hardware company Ravijour has deployed wearable sex tech for it's \\"True Love Tester.\\" Touted as “A revolutionary bra that knows how women truly feel,\\" the garment is fitted with a device that registers heart rate and send it via Bluetooth to an app which calculates to what degree your pulse starts racing when you spot a certain someone. Sure, for the emotionally incognisant, this could totally work. Particularly because when your pulse leads the device to declare you sufficiently loved-up, the bra pops open (because nothing inspires “true love” in a potential partner like an incapacitated underwire). At the more exoteric end of the spectrum is the wearable sex tech from Je Joue. Their G-spot and clitoral-focused Dua toy comes complete with its own discreet ballpoint pen-shaped remote for “partner-play” and an app to give your other half long-distance control over what your device is doing to you. Will Ranscombe, MD of Je Joue, explained, “We designed the Dua with couples in mind. We wanted to break away from the stereotype of sex toys for singletons by developing a toy that encouraged partner play. For us the obvious route was to create a toy that is controlled by your partner, allowing the other half to completely let go.” So what would he say to the argument that these days we pay more attention to our devices than our partners anyway, and surely this sort of app-based playing with wearable tech will push people further apart and increase our propensity to substitute technology for tangible intimacy? “The app is just a facilitator for encouraging interaction between couples,\\" Ranscombe says. \\"It's so simple to use, with swiping up and down and left and right to control, you need not even look at your iPhone whilst you're using it, you can focus purely on your partner and their reaction.” There's an historical precedence for all this, too. Sex has always been a crucial driver of technological innovation, from VHS players and camcorders to home answerphones (prostitutes were early adopters of home answering machines in the 1950s, argues historian David Morton). The younger generation are already on board. A survey conducted by the Center for Generational Kinetics and Wearables.com and published last month found that a quarter of millennials (individuals born between 1977 and 1995) were willing to wear some sort of wearable technology during sex. So if you're still not convinced, perhaps you're just too old for this sort of thing. Will Ranscombe is in no doubt that we'll continue to see a slew of technologies that connect people sexually and remotely. “You should see the weird and wacky ideas that are pitched to us involving cameras, vibrators, lasers, and robots on a daily basis,\\" he says. \\"But for us it has been, and always will be, about you and your partner sharing intimacy that is borne out of human experiences and not technology. If we can use technology to help this, then great, but for us technology will never replace it.”","completion":"Wearable technology has been recognized as the future of sex, with innovative devices and apps offering new and interactive experiences for users. Products like Frixion are allowing users to simulate intimacy and even participate in mass cyber sessions with one person controlling thousands of devices, while apps like Glance for Google Glass enable couples to experience sex from their partner's perspective. Wearable tech for sex also comes in the form of Ravijour's \\"True Love Tester\\" bra, which is equipped with a heart rate monitor and a Bluetooth-enabled device that sends data to an app, gauging the wearer's attraction level. Je Joue's Dua toy, designed for couples, allows partners to control G-spot and clitoral stimulation devices from a distance via a discreet remote and accompanying app. A familiar argument against such technology is that it may push people apart and substitute technology for tangible intimacy, but the creators assert that these devices simply facilitate increased interaction between couples.

Background: Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov (; Russian: Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov, pronounced [vla'djimjIr na'bok@f] ( listen), also known by the pen name Vladimir Sirin; 22 April [O.S. 10 April] 1899 - 2 July 1977) was a Russian-American novelist, translator and entomologist. Context: Nabokov was a classical liberal, in the tradition of his father, a liberal statesman who served in the Provisional Government following the February Revolution of 1917. Nabokov was a self-proclaimed \\"White Russian\\", and was, from its inception, a strong opponent of the Soviet government that came to power following the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917. In a poem he wrote as a teenager in 1917, he described Lenin's Bolsheviks as \\"grey rag-tag people\\". Throughout his life, Nabokov would remain committed to the classical liberal political philosophy of his father, and equally opposed Tsarist autocracy, communism and fascism. Nabokov's father Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov was the most outspoken defender of Jewish rights in the Russian Empire, continuing in a family tradition that had been led by his own father, Dmitry Nabokov, who as Justice Minister under Tsar Alexander II had successfully blocked anti-semitic measures from being passed by the Interior Minister. That family strain would continue in Vladimir Nabokov, who fiercely denounced anti-semitism in his writings, and in the 1930s Nabokov was able to escape Hitler's Germany only with the help of Russian Jewish emigres who still had grateful memories of his family's defense of Jews in Tsarist times. When asked, in 1969, whether he would like to revisit the land he had fled in 1918, now the Soviet Union, he replied: \\"There's nothing to look at. New tenement houses and old churches do not interest me. The hotels there are terrible. I detest the Soviet theater. Any palace in Italy is superior to the repainted abodes of the Tsars. The village huts in the forbidden hinterland are as dismally poor as ever, and the wretched peasant flogs his wretched cart horse with the same wretched zest. As to my special northern landscape and the haunts of my childhood - well, I would not wish to contaminate their images preserved in my mind.\\" Question: What else was interesting about his political views?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Vladimir Nabokov's political views are interesting due to his firm stance as a classical liberal, which he maintained throughout his life, following in the footsteps of his father. As a self-proclaimed \\"White Russian,\\" he opposed not only the Soviet government and communism but also Tsarist autocracy and fascism, demonstrating his commitment to a balanced political philosophy. Furthermore, his family's strong tradition of advocating for Jewish rights, which started with his grandfather and continued through his father, also persisted in Nabokov's own vocal condemnation of anti-semitism in his writings. These various aspects of his political beliefs, particularly in the context of the historical events he lived through, make Nabokov's views compelling and distinct."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process: - Food leaves the esophagus and enters the stomach - The stomach churns the food - With the aid of stomach acids - The food becomes a thick liquid - Is then passed to the small intestine. Question: suppose food stays in stomach longer happens, how will it affect MORE digestion occuring. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"If the food stays in the stomach longer than it typically should, the impact on the digestion process can vary, but it will generally lead to more digestion occurring within the stomach. This would represent option A: more. To understand this effect, we need to explore the different aspects of the digestive process and how a prolonged stay in the stomach might influence them. 1. Gastric Acid Secretion: The stomach's primary function is to secrete gastric juices, including hydrochloric acid and enzymes like pepsin, to break down proteins and other food components. If food remains in the stomach for an extended period, more gastric juices are produced, which could lead to increased digestion of proteins and other macronutrients within the stomach. 2. Churning and Mixing: The stomach's muscular walls also aid in digestion by churning and mixing the food with gastric juices. By staying in the stomach longer, the food receives additional mixing and exposure to these digestive enzymes and acids, leading to further disintegration and digestion. 3. pH Balance: Different parts of the digestive system have unique pH levels to optimize digestive processes. In the stomach, a lower pH (higher acidity) is optimal for breaking down proteins. If food remains in the stomach for an extended period, it may lead to a more acidic environment, which could facilitate more digestion. On the other hand, one must also consider potential negative effects of prolonged food retention in the stomach: 1. Delayed Nutrient Absorption: The majority of nutrient absorption occurs in the small intestine. A delay in the passage of food from the stomach to the small intestine might lead to delayed nutrient absorption, which can cause nutritional deficiencies over time. 2. Reduced Appetite and Satiety: When food remains in the stomach for a longer duration, it can decrease appetite and cause a sensation of fullness, which might lead to reduced food intake and impact an individual's nutritional status. 3. Potential GI Issues: Prolonged food retention in the stomach may result from underlying gastrointestinal issues, such as gastroparesis, which could further compromise digestive functioning and overall health. In conclusion, if food stays in the stomach longer than usual, it will most likely result in more digestion occurring within the stomach due to increased gastric acid secretion and additional churning and mixing. However, this scenario could also have negative consequences, such as delayed nutrient absorption and potential gastrointestinal issues, thus emphasizing the importance of maintaining healthy digestion and addressing any underlying issues that may be causing prolonged food retention in the stomach."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Afterward, Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn that the June 12 summit in Singapore between him and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, was back on. Trump, however, sought to quell some of the high expectations, saying the summit would \\"be a beginning\\" and subsequent discussions were likely to be needed to get Pyongyang to agree to denuclearization. \\"We're not going to go in and sign something on June 12th, and we never were,\\" he said. \\"We're going to start a process.\\" Trump declared he \\"never said it happens in one meeting,\\" but that it \\"will ultimately be a successful process.\\" Asked by VOA News whether the North Koreans had committed to complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization, Trump replied only that \\"we talked about a lot of things.\\" 'Take your time' The president said he told Kim Yong Chol, the former head of North Korean military intelligence, \\"Take your time. We can go fast. We can go slowly.\\" The president made clear that sanctions on North Korea would not be lifted, however, until the country agreed to give up its nuclear arsenal. As the negotiations over the Singapore summit play out in public, there is a sense among some observers that Trump and Kim Jong Un each have a clear sense of the deal they ultimately want to strike. Less clear is whether the U.S. and North Korean visions can match up in any meaningful way. \\"Singapore might be the first time people will have to put their cards on the table,\\" a U.S. official said on the condition of anonymity. Upon his arrival Friday at the White House, Kim Yong Chol, who is under U.S. sanctions for links to cyberattacks against American companies, delivered a letter from Kim Jong Un. While Trump did not reveal the contents, he described the gesture as \\"very nice.\\" Why did Pres Trump say nothing would be signed on June 12th?

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Alex Ward. PUBLISHED:. 04:09 EST, 20 February 2013. |. UPDATED:. 13:24 EST, 20 February 2013. The stepmother of a 13-year-old boy who died after he was beaten and kept in a dog cage has been sentenced to 35 years in jail. Kimberly Kubina, 47, pleaded guilty to felony neglect over teenager Christian Choate’s death, whose severely malnourished body was found in a shallow grave at a mobile home park in Gary, Indiana shortly after he was reported missing in May 2011. Kubina’s former husband Riley Choate, 40, of Hammond, Indiana was also sentenced to 80 years in prison last month. Kept in a dog cage: Kimberly Kubina (right) was sentenced to 35 years for the death of stepson Christian Choate (left) who was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long as a year before he died. Investigators said the boy was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long as a year before he died at the age of 13 in early 2009. His disappearance went unreported until Lake County police unearthed his body in May, 2011 from a shallow grave. The Lake County Coroner's Office determined he died of blunt force trauma injuries and a skull fracture. Kubina told the Lake Superior Court that she was remorseful for not stopping the abuse involving her stepson. She said that Choate was intimidating and violent and that she feared that the other children, including several nephews and nieces, she was looking after would be taken away by the welfare authorities. Father's son: Christian's father and Kubina's former husband Riley Choate was sentenced to 80 years in jail last month over his involvement in the boy's death. She said in court, according to the Chicago Sun-Times: ‘In our house, whatever Riley said was law.’ The woman told the judge that she. suffered nightmares about what had happened and that the other children,. who had seen the abuse, were emotionally scarred. Christian was kept in a dog cage and. Kubina told the court in May that she told his sister to only feed him. Asian noodles while locked up as punishment for 'molesting' his younger. step-brother. The. unidentified sister was not the only one to know about the horrible. suffering that the boy endured, and up to 13 people are thought to have. known about the torture without alerting the police. Court. records state that the father, Riley Choate, has admitted burying. Christian's body under a storage shed with a Bible across his chest but. denied causing the boy's death. Kubina, the stepmother, repeatedly has denied any wrongdoing, court and Indiana Department of Child Services records show. Originally, she told police she thought Christian had gone to live with his biological mother. Only. one person claims to have taken her concerns to the authorities,. according to the state's Department of Child Services records. Investigators. say the boy was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long. as a year before he died at the age of 13 in early 2009. Both Choate and Kubina had pleaded not guilty to all charges surrounding Christian’s death originally. Intimidating and violent: Kubina told the court: 'In our house, whatever Riley said was law,' after Christian's severely malnourished body was found in a shallow grave at a mobile home park in Gary, Indiana. Choate made a deal with prosecutors. to plead guilty to some charges in return for a lessened sentence and to. avoid a jury trial. He pleaded guilty to felony charges including. moving a body after death and neglect of a dependent causing death. In return for the guilty pleas, prosecutors dropped charges of murder, battery, criminal confinement and obstruction of justice. Choate. himself addressed the judge before learning his fate in January,. saying: 'All my actions will haunt me forever. I loved my son.' Kubina was given a similar deal for testifying against her former husband. Kubina's sister, Belinda Bradburn, told The Times she witnessed abuse once while visiting her sister and the children when they lived in Merrillville. She said she saw Riley Choate hit Christian in the arm. 'When that happened, I just said, \\"Kim, I'm leaving. This is kind of ridiculous that he would just hit a kid, and you need to do something about this\\",' Bradburn recalled. Body placement: Choate has admitted burying Christian's body under a storage shed. Kubina told the Lake Superior Court that she was remorseful for not stopping the abuse involving her stepson. In December MailOnline reported that Christian wrote letters from his squalid prison about how he wanted his life to end. He wrote: ‘I want to die’ on the paper given to him by his stepmother to scribble down how he felt. In the handwritten notes, he said he simply wanted to be liked by his family - even if they were ‘abusing’ him. Christian writes how he had to steal food when he was hungry because his family allegedly would not feed him. He would only be let out to clean the house and was almost never allowed outside. ‘Christian wrote of why nobody liked him and how he just wanted to be liked by his family,’ DCS records state. ‘Christian stated that he wanted to die because nobody liked the way he 'acted.' The records continue: 'Christian's writings detail a very sad, depressed child who often wondered when someone, anyone, was going to come check on him and give him food or liquid. Christian often stated he was hungry or thirsty.’","completion":"A tragic case involving the death of a 13-year-old boy has led to the sentencing of his stepmother and father.

A:","completion":"The last Land Rover Defender, retaining its iconic design that had stayed recognizable for decades, rolled off the production line on January 29, 2016 at the Solihull plant in West Midlands, UK. This event marked the end of an era as the Defender has been an influential part of the automotive industry with its uniquely rugged and robust design. The Defender's journey began 67 years earlier, as a post-war project at the Rover Company, with the launch of the \\"Land Rover\\" concept at the Amsterdam Motor Show in 1948. The concept was envisioned as a utility vehicle for farmers, perfectly incarnating strength and durability. Over the years, this vehicle became popular worldwide as the \\"Land Rover Series\\", and it was widely known for its versatile capabilities including agricultural purposes, exploration tours, military utilization and even in royal households. In 1983 however, the Land Rover Series was renamed the 'Defender' to represent its abilities robustly. This rugged off-roader seemed immune to the passage of time and maintained its production, although with various upgrades and tweaks, largely due to its go-anywhere competency and durability. Across the UK and abroad, it was frequently seen as police cars, ambulances, expedition vehicles, and even school buses. However, tightening emission and safety regulations worldwide made it increasingly difficult for Land Rover to comply with these standards without altering the Defender’s trademark design and functionality. As a result, Land Rover decided to make a profound decision by ending its production after almost seven decades, in 2016. This iconic 4x4 vehicle was commemorated by Land Rover by creating three limited editions called Autobiography, Heritage, and Adventure. The final production model was a Defender 90 Heritage Soft Top, painted in a distinctive 'Grasmere Green' and having a soft-top design. Although the original Defender production ceased in 2016, Land Rover introduced a completely redesigned version of the Defender in 2020 that combines modern aesthetics with the rugged functionality of the original, marking a new chapter in the Defender's history. The new model incorporates advanced technology and redesigned features, while still retaining a sense of nostalgia and cultural heritage closely associated with the iconic Defender lineage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is unique in that it is a sport where able and disabled persons, and people as young as 5 years and as old as 80 years of age can participate alongside each other. It is a sport that involves more than one person, and is a wonderful family activity that gathers members together for a day of fun at a favorite waterway. Anyone who has put on water skis can attest to its health benefits--it is a sport that demands and develops strength, agility and endurance. The sport includes several disciplines including slalom, tricks, cable, jump, ski racing, kneeboard, wakeboard, and barefoot, with each of these practiced for either recreational or competitive enjoyment. Safety Tips for Water-Skiers Don't take unnecessary risks while water-skiing. The following tips will help you safely enjoy this thrilling sport: ALWAYS have an observer in the boat. This is a legal requirement in many states. The boat driver cannot watch the skier and operate the boat safely at the same time. ALWAYS wear a Coast Guard approved Personal Flotation Device (PFD) designed for water skiing. Ski belts are NOT recommended. Your approved PFD will help keep you afloat. NEVER ski in rough water. High waves or a choppy sea will prevent the tow boat from maintaining a steady course and speed. NEVER ski after dark. It is dangerous AND illegal. Any boat traveling fast enough to tow a skier is traveling too fast to navigate safely at night. NEVER water-ski while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Such activity is extremely dangerous because of the impairment to your judgment and ability to respond. A recent study conducted with expert skiers who were purposely drunk indicated that even their ability to ski was dramatically reduced. Use hand signals between the skier and observer. Agree before you start what each signal means so there is no confusion at a critical moment. Question: The purpose of the article is to _ .

His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign (c. 278 – c. 255 BCE), as well as those of his successors, the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle.

Context: As Julie kept asking question after question, all I could think of was how desperately I needed a normal, healthy relationship. As far as most of my relationships went, mine with Julie was great. But it was great in all the wrong places. There really wasn't much more to it than sex. Even though it was a mind-numbing, bathe-in-gasoline-to-slough-the-shame-from-my-soul kind of sex, it didn't matter. At the end of the day we were just objects to each other. We couldn't talk about anything else. We'd tried before, but it had usually led to an afternoon of power-fucking in every changing room on Rodeo Drive. It was a fun ride, but nothing more. And like every great ride, Julie was beautiful, fast, and could turn on a dime in the blink of an eye. \\"I don't understand, Dingo.\\" I couldn't tell if it was the 12 stitches over my eye giving me the headache or Julie's prattling. I bit off a stretch of red tape and put it over the empty socket where my taillight should have been while I balanced the phone between my shoulder and swollen cheek. \\"Julie, I told you. Darby took the box.\\" \\"I get that, but--.\\" \\"The box my dad hand-carved just before he died.\\" I could feel the two edges of skin stitched together pull at each other every time my jaw moved. \\"Yes, yes, and the box protects your family's dirty little secret or your mother's pride and joy or whatever the hell it is you're calling it this week.\\" \\"Hey, I told you not to go digging--. \\" \\"I don't care what it is, Dingo! I couldn't give a shit about that damn box or what's inside. The only thing I want to know is what the fuck your ex-wife was doing there.\\" So there it was. And I thought she was jealous just because somebody else got to beat the living crap out of me for a change. \\"Julie, I didn't even know she was in town until after I was in the hospital.\\" Question: Who character thought to be annoing? Answer: Answer:","completion":"In this context, the character perceived to be annoying is Julie. The speaker, presumably Dingo, finds her barrage of questions to be irritating and headache-inducing. This is evident from his thoughts and feelings expressed throughout the narrative, describing their relationship primarily based on physical attraction with a distinct lack of emotional or intellectual connection, especially evidenced when he calls their conversations \\"prattling\\". Furthermore, his exasperation is highlighted when he mentions trying to maintain a conversation while juggling other tasks, suggesting that Julie's incessant inquiries add to his stress. Dingo even goes so far as to express a desire for a \\"normal, healthy relationship\\", emphasizing the element of dissatisfaction he experiences with the current dynamics with Julie. At multiple instances, he attempts to shut down the conversation or deflect Julie's queries, indicating his frustration and annoyance. Moreover, while Julie's desire to understand the situation and her concerns about Dingo's ex-wife's presence are legitimate, her approach and timing, as described in this story, are perceived as bothersome by Dingo. Finally, there is a thematic indicator of annoyance in the narrative; Dingo experiences physical discomfort or pain as he communicates with Julie, implying that her constant questions are an irritant. His annoyance at Julie is compounded by his physical state, with the '12 stitches over his eye' and the 'pull at each other every time his jaw moved,' indirectly associating the pain he's suffering with his interactions with her. In sum, within this context, Julie is depicted as the character that Dingo perceives as annoying."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In the first sentence, the speaker acknowledges that they felt empathy in their heart while they were president but admits that they didn't do as well in outreach, showing compassion, and concern compared to their sons. This sentence implies that the speaker's sons were more successful in expressing their empathy and making compassionate connections with others. In contrast, the second sentence claims that the speaker is more empathetic than their sons. This statement would mean that the speaker possesses a greater capacity to understand and share the feelings of others compared to their sons, which is not suggested in the first sentence.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: Designer and TV host Nate Berkus is a member of the American Red Cross Celebrity Cabinet, which helps to highlight the organization's initiatives and response efforts. Founded in 1881, the American Red Cross is part of a worldwide movement that offers humanitarian care to victims of war and natural disasters. Berkus recently spoke with CNN's Allie Torgan about his personal connection to the Red Cross and how he is giving back. Below are excerpts from that interview. Allie Torgan: Why are you involved with the Red Cross? Nate Berkus: I have a very personal connection to the Red Cross because when I survived the tsunami -- the Indian Ocean tsunami, which was seven years ago now -- the Swiss Red Cross was the first sign of help that I saw with my own eyes. The sad part for me was that my partner, who I was traveling with to a tiny surfing village in Sri Lanka, didn't survive ... like many, many other people. And it was really an eye-opening experience for me ... and a soul-opening experience for me because I think we really don't know who we are until we don't have the resources that we need. Torgan: How did that experience affect you? Berkus: For me, having survived a natural disaster of that magnitude, there are things that happen that you don't even think about. Sometimes you just need a pair of flip-flops so that your feet aren't cut as you're walking around in the debris. Sometimes you need the equivalent of 5 in foreign currency to make a phone call to tell the people that love you you're OK or that somebody you love is not OK. And sometimes you need somebody just to give you a pencil and a piece of paper so that you can write down important details ... things that are flying through your mind like your passport number. I went through a very long period of grief and also sort of re-acclimating myself to what the reality of my life was. Torgan: What is your role as a member of the Celebrity Cabinet? Berkus: The main goal for me is to raise awareness of what the Red Cross does. I think especially at this time of the year, we all have so many holiday traditions. ... And if one of those traditions as families could be to volunteer or donate blood to the Red Cross as part of everything that we take for granted in this season, it would be really amazing. That kind of thinking is what being on the Celebrity Cabinet is all about. And obviously with the visibility that I'm lucky enough to have -- having a daily talk show and being able to meet people all across the country -- it's a way for me to give back to an organization that gave me something when I didn't have anything. Torgan: Why are you involved in the CNN Heroes campaign? Berkus: I think the Heroes campaign is really great because it highlights everyday people that we relate to, and it brings them to a place where they're getting recognition. But even as you're watching, you know that the recognition is not what they are after. What they're after was the deed that they chose to do. There's so much on TV ... so much passive, yucky stuff that just fills our brain with things that don't inspire us at all. And to watch somebody doing something for somebody else -- completely selflessly, having no idea that they would be chosen by CNN to be a Hero -- is something that's worthwhile for everyone to watch. Highlights:","completion":"1. Nate Berkus is a member of the American Red Cross Celebrity Cabinet, which helps the organization. 2.

He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all.

Given the context: What will happen to Jan? Answer:","completion":"Without knowing the specific movie title or plot, I can only provide a general analysis based on the provided information. Throughout the movie, it seems that Carson, a significant character, has been leading Jan through various life experiences. The relationship between Carson and Jan seems to play a critical role in Jan's personal development, and the class that watched the movie likely did so with a particular lesson or moral in mind. Given this context, several different outcomes are possible for Jan, depending on the nature of their relationship with Carson, the overall premise of the movie, and the intended takeaway for the class: 1. Positive outcome: If the movie aims to convey a message about the importance of mentorship or guidance, Jan may find great success and happiness due to Carson's influence. Carson might play the role of a role model or life coach, providing valuable support and wisdom at crucial points in Jan's life. In this case, the students would learn about the transformative power of friendship, mentorship, or guidance in overcoming life's challenges. 2. Lessons through adversity: In contrast, if the movie's focus is on self-discovery or personal growth, Jan might ultimately realize that they cannot rely solely upon Carson's guidance to lead them through life. Jan may face a turning point where they need to make a difficult decision or confront a challenge independently in order to truly grow and mature. In this case, the students would learn about the importance of self-reliance, autonomy, and the value of learning from mistakes or hardships. 3. Bittersweet outcome: The movie could also explore themes of loss or change, with Jan having to navigate life without Carson due to a tragic event, separation, or other circumstances. In this scenario, Jan would need to learn to apply what they have learned from their relationship with Carson to their own life, as they now embark on a journey of self-discovery and growth. This outcome would teach students about resilience, adaptability, and the power of memories in shaping one's identity. 4. Unexpected or open-ended outcome: The movie could leave Jan's fate uncertain or open-ended, allowing the viewers to interpret the story and the lessons learned in their own way. This type of ending could invite class discussion and debate about the implications of the story, allowing students to draw from their own experiences and perspectives when making meaning of the film. Regardless of the movie's specific outcome, the fact that the class students watched it implies that there is a valuable lesson or message for them to explore, discuss, and learn from. By examining Jan's experiences and the role that Carson plays in their life, students can gain a deeper understanding of human relationships, personal development, and the various challenges and triumphs that one might encounter throughout life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(February 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) As a bleak, dark scene unfolds, animals are seen struggling through the mud as Jessie (Julia Ormond), a old, nearly blind Border Collie (the narrator) reflects on the events that led them to their current situation. The film flashes back years earlier. As the alcoholic and abusive farmer, Mr. Jones (Pete Postlethwaite), struggles with debt to neighbor farmer Mr. Pilkington, Old Major (Peter Ustinov), the oldest pig at Manor Farm, holds a meeting with the animals in the barn. Old Major tells the animals that mankind is their enemy, for they serve and provide for mankind without reward. Old Major teaches the animals the song, \\"Beasts of the World,\\" which proclaims that animals must overthrow man in order to be free and equal. The meeting is interrupted when Jones stumbles outside the barn and accidentally fires his gun, killing Old Major. When Jones neglects to feed the animals, Boxer (Paul Scofield), the work horse, leads the animals to the food shed, and the pigs lead a revolution against Jones, his wife, and the farm workers, forcing them off the property. Under the rule of animals, Manor Farm is renamed Animal Farm by Snowball (Kelsey Grammer), a pig who has learned to read and write. Snowball paints on the barn doors what he calls the seven commandments of Animalism, which, in accordance with Old Major's views, forbid animals from behaving like humans or killing other animals. The final commandment reads, \\"All animals are equal.\\" Snowball teaches the animals to chant, \\"Four legs good, two legs bad\\" and also reveals the \\"Hoof and Horn,\\" a flag that represents Animal Farm. Napoleon (Patrick Stewart), another pig, declares that the farmhouse is to be preserved as a museum, and the three pigs (Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer (Ian Holm) oversee the farm's operation.

Don’t look for a boyfriend or a relationship to make you feel wanted or valued—it’s a recipe for disaster. The more confident you are in yourself, the more compelling you’ll be to your boyfriend and to other people in general. Humans are quite good at sensing when people are insecure or inauthentic, and it tends to be a universal detractor. It will inevitably leave you unsatisfied because no one else can truly make you feel valued—that’s something only you can do. If you place a significant amount of your self-worth in a relationship, you’re entrusting your value to something that isn’t about you—relationships are about two people learning to be, yes, in a relationship with each other. It not only doesn’t make sense to see a relationship as a reflection of your own worth, it will ultimately backfire and leave you irrationally dependent on another person for your sense of self. Though he can and hopefully will provide supplemental love and support, he can’t—and shouldn’t—carry the weight of all your physical and emotional needs. Set aside time to physically take care of yourself, whether that means taking a bath, going to the gym, learning self-defense, playing with your dog, playing a sport, etc. When you’re physically well, you’ll be more naturally confident and independent, a highly attractive attribute in anyone, and particularly in a partner.

Information: - A biplane is a fixed-wing aircraft with two main wings stacked one above the other. The first powered, controlled aeroplane to fly, the Wright Flyer, used a biplane wing arrangement, as did many aircraft in the early years of aviation. While a biplane wing structure has a structural advantage over a monoplane, it produces more drag than a similar unbraced or cantilever monoplane wing. Improved structural techniques, better materials and the quest for greater speed made the biplane configuration obsolete for most purposes by the late 1930s. - In computing, WinG (pronounced \\"Win Gee\\") is an application programming interface that is a port of Windows 95's Device Independent Bitmaps to provide faster graphics performance on Windows 3.x operating environments, and was initially positioned as a way to help game developers more easily port their DOS games to Microsoft Windows, although it was quickly discontinued in favor of DirectX. - Hawker Aircraft Limited was a British aircraft manufacturer responsible for some of the most famous products in British aviation history. - Sir Sydney Camm, CBE, FRAeS (5 August 189312 March 1966) was an English aeronautical engineer who contributed to many Hawker aircraft designs, from the biplanes of the 1920s to jet fighters. One particularly notable aircraft he designed is the Hawker Hurricane fighter. - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved. - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain. - The Hawker Hart was a British two-seater biplane light bomber aircraft of the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was designed during the 1920s by Sydney Camm and manufactured by Hawker Aircraft. The Hart was a prominent British aircraft in the inter-war period, but was obsolete and already side-lined for newer monoplane aircraft designs by the start of the Second World War, playing only minor roles in the conflict before being retired. - The Hawker Fury was a British biplane fighter aircraft used by the Royal Air Force in the 1930s . It was a fast , agile aircraft , and holds the distinction of being the first interceptor in RAF service to be capable of more than 200 MPH . The Fury is the fighter counterpart to the Hawker Hart light bomber . - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941.

The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta.[7] When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope).

A:","completion":"Question: Why does the Danube river delta grow larger and faster than the Volga river delta, despite both rivers forming deltas?

Newport council said it had consulted on the plans at a time when efforts were being made to improve the area, including building a shopping centre. It said the issues were among the most frequent concerns reported to Gwent Police and the fire service. But human rights organisation Liberty said a ban would \\"criminalise the most vulnerable in the city\\". The organisation has written to council leader Bob Bright to express its concerns. Rosie Brighouse, legal officer for Liberty, said: \\"These proposals make a mockery of Newport's Chartist legacy.\\" The council wants to introduce a new Public Spaces Protection Order to tackle anti-social behaviour ahead of the opening of the new Friar's Walk shopping centre next month. It has consulted with members of the public about what they would like to see included, such as a ban on begging, rough sleeping, dogs who are not on leads and leafleting in the city centre. Councillor Bob Poole, cabinet member for regulatory functions, said the council was trying to make the city centre a more appealing place to visit. \\"Few people in Newport will have failed to notice the changes taking place in the heart of the city centre, most notably Friar's Walk retail development due to open in November and arguably the most significant investment in Newport's recent history,\\" he said. \\"It is perhaps timely, against this background of positive change, that this new piece of legislation offers the city and its residents the chance to build on that momentum by ensuring that the experience of people visiting the city centre is a positive one.\\" The council has so far received 350 responses to the consultation and said all views would be taken into consideration before a final decision was made.

When Transportation Security Administration officials don't follow the agency's rules, getting through the airport with the gear -- and a baby -- gets more difficult. A breast-feeding incident that has had TSA critics buzzing since last week was addressed in an apologetic blog post Thursday from the agency's \\"Blogger Bob\\" Burns. The controversy started when an agent at Kauai's Lihue Airport in Hawaii wouldn't allow passenger Amy Strand to board a plane February 29 with her breast pump because the milk bottles were empty, CNN affiliate KITV-TV in Honolulu reported. As a result Strand used her electric breast pump in a public airport restroom to fill the bottles and get them through security. She was traveling with her 9-month-old daughter, Eva. \\"I had to stand in front of the mirrors and the sinks and pump my breast, in front of every tourist that walked into that bathroom,\\" Strand told KITV. TSA admitted its agent made a mistake shortly afterward, saying in a statement: \\"We accept responsibility for the apparent misunderstanding and any inconvenience or embarrassment this incident may have caused her. The officer in question is receiving remedial training.\\" Burns, the TSA blogger, announced Thursday that the agency has updated its website \\"to help clarify the procedures for traveling with ice packs, breast milk, juice, and water.\\" The policy explained on the site now explicitly says that ice packs and empty bottles are permitted through security. \\"Mistakes such as this happen from time to time and for that we are truly sorry,\\" Burns wrote. \\"However, we can and have learned from mistakes in the past, so please be sure to let us know when you think or know something could have been handled differently.\\" Burns advised passengers to ask for a supervisor in uncomfortable situations or to call TSA customer service numbers listed in his post -- 866-289-9673 and 855-787-2227. Commenters on Burns' post weren't all satisfied with his advice. One said: \\"1) It has been frequently reported that TSA staff do not care whether or not something has been clearly stated on the website when they are imposing their own understanding of the rules; 2) It has been frequently reported that polite requests to speak with supervisors are treated as defiant behavior.\\" Those comments may refer to a 2010 incident involving a breast-feeding mother that resulted in a lawsuit against the TSA and Department of Homeland Security. According to the suit, Stacey Armato was traveling with breast milk for her 7-month-old son and requested alternate screening for the milk at a Phoenix International Airport checkpoint to avoid X-ray exposure. The suit says the same TSA agents she had encountered in the security line at the airport the week before retaliated against her for filing a complaint when her request for alternate screening for her breast milk in that instance met with resistance. The suit alleges that on her second encounter with the agents, Armato was directed to a \\"special inspection\\" area, where her requests to speak to a manager were refused. A uniformed police officer was also called in, according to court filings. Armato is suing on grounds of intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and false imprisonment. The suit alleges that screeners initially refused to review a printout that Armato provided of TSA guidelines pertaining to breast milk. The TSA said it sent a letter of apology to Armato shortly afterward. Despite some less-than-smooth incidents, many breast-feeding mothers pass through security with no trouble. One woman who said she's a nursing mother and hasn't had any trouble with security commented on the Strand incident: \\"Like several have said, this is not representative of TSA as an agency, but the stupidity of that particular agent.\\" Breast-feeding moms, what are your experiences of traveling while nursing? Please share your comments below. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Traveling while breastfeeding can pose challenges, especially when faced with Transportation Security Administration (TSA) rules at airports.

In a game of hide-and-seek, where a player named Anna tries to remain unseen, and someone else suggests that she stay still to avoid being found. 2. During a medical examination or a procedure where staying still is of importance, the healthcare professional may ask Anna not to move for safety and accuracy in the process. 3. When a photographer wants a person named Anna to hold a particular pose for a picture, the photographer might instruct her to not move.

He ruled the Principality of Halych from 1188 until 1189/1190, and again between 1208/1209 and 1210. He was the younger son of Béla III of Hungary, who entrusted him with the administration of the newly conquered Principality of Halych in 1188. Andrew's rule was unpopular, and the boyars expelled him. Béla III willed property and money to Andrew, obliging him to lead a crusade to the Holy Land. Instead, Andrew forced his elder brother, King Emeric of Hungary, to cede Croatia and Dalmatia as an appanage to him in 1197. The following year, Andrew occupied Hum. - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe.

Because of the recent conquest of Sicily by Peter, the Pope declared a crusade against him and officially deposed him as king, on the grounds that Sicily was a papal fief: Peter's grandfather and namesake, Peter II, had surrendered the kingdom as a fief to the Holy See. Martin bestowed Aragon on Charles, Count of Valois, son of the French king, Philip III, and nephew of Peter III. - Ciociaria is an area of Central Italy roughly corresponding to the province of Frosinone, but without a defined border nor historical identity. The name was adopted by a fascist movement of Frosinone as an ethnical denomination for the province of Frosinone, when it was created in 1927. In the Middle Ages, this region was referred to as \\"Campagna\\". The local dialect, now known as \\"ciociaro\\", was earlier referred to as \\"campanino\\".

The component realms of the Crown were not united politically except at the level of the king, who ruled over each autonomous polity according to its own laws, raising funds under each tax structure, dealing separately with each \\"Corts\\" or \\"Cortes\\". Put in contemporary terms, it has sometimes been considered that the different lands of the Crown of Aragon (mainly the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia and the Kingdom of Valencia) functioned more as a confederation than as a single kingdom. In this sense, the larger Crown of Aragon must not be confused with one of its constituent parts, the Kingdom of Aragon, from which it takes its name. - Sardinia ( / , Sassarese: \\"Sardhigna\\", Gallurese: \\"Saldigna\\", Catalan: \\"Sardenya\\", Tabarchino: \\"Sardegna\\") is the second largest island in the Mediterranean Sea (after Sicily and before Cyprus) and an autonomous region of Italy.

The right bank of the Tiber was occupied by the Etruscan city of Veii, and the other borders were occupied by Italic tribes. Subsequently, Rome defeated Veii and then its Italic neighbors, expanding Latium to the Apennine Mountains in the northeast and to the opposite end of the marsh in the southeast. The modern descendant, the Italian \\"Regione\\" of Lazio, also called \\"Latium\\" in Latin, and occasionally in modern English, is somewhat larger still, but not as much as double the original Latium. - While the medieval Angevin Kingdom of Albania was a monarchy, it did not encompass the entirety of the modern state of Albania.

Simon said that he did not immediately realize the magnitude of the event: \\"I didn't get what had happened – how big it was – until I went home, turned on the television and saw it on all the news ... and later that night on the front pages of all the newspapers. Then I got it.\\"In May 1982, Simon & Garfunkel went on a world tour with stops in Japan, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ireland, France, Great Britain, New Zealand, the US and Canada. The European leg of their tour began on May 28, 1982, at the Stadion am Bieberer Berg in Offenbach am Main. This was their first performance in Germany, and had an attendance of around 40,000 spectators.When they were not on the road, the duo went into the studio to work on what was to be a reunion Simon & Garfunkel album, tentatively entitled Think Too Much, with Garfunkel adding harmony vocals to a bunch of new songs for which Simon had already laid down some backing tracks. They set a release date of spring 1983 to coincide with their planned North American tour, but after increasingly acrimonious delays and disagreements, Simon told Warner Brothers he could no longer work with Garfunkel and that the project as an S&G album was cancelled. Thus Garfunkel dropped out of the project, which then became Simon's November 1983 solo album Hearts and Bones.Several years would pass before Simon & Garfunkel worked together again. Their next joint public appearance was in 1990, when they performed for their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. When Simon gave another free concert in Central Park on August 15, 1991, he rejected Garfunkel's offer to participate. However, they agreed to perform together in 1993 for 21 sold out concerts in New York, with half of the show being Paul Simon solo with a band and the other half Simon and Garfunkel.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards was the longest rushing play?","completion":"Title: The Longest Rushing Play in History: Athletes Who Defied the Odds Introduction The world of professional American Football has witnessed some truly riveting moments and notable records over the years. From spectacular touchdowns and incredible comebacks to jaw-dropping statistics, fans have been consistently entertained by the athletes' prowess and determination on the field. Among the many records, one that particularly stands out is the accomplishment of having the longest rushing play in the history of the National Football League (NFL). In this article, we will delve into the details of this magnificent feat, explore the astounding athletes who achieved it, and relive the excitement surrounding this record-breaking moment. The Longest Rushing Play in NFL History: Who and When? The record for the longest rushing play in NFL history is a staggering 99 yards, and it has been achieved on not just one, but two separate occasions. First, the record was set on January 3, 1983, during the game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Minnesota Vikings. The legendary Tony Dorsett, a running back for the Cowboys, stunned the world with an unbelievable 99-yard run from scrimmage to score a touchdown. This electrifying moment took place during the Monday Night Football broadcast; it has since become one of the most unforgettable plays of all time. Decades later, Derrick Henry, a running back representing the Tennessee Titans, matched this seemingly unattainable record on December 6, 2018, in a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. With the whole world watching, fans and sports pundits couldn't believe their eyes when Henry replicated Dorsett's epic achievement. A Closer Look at the 99-Yard Rushing Play In Tony Dorsett's case, the Cowboys were starting from their one-yard line, with a near-ideal formation that comprised only 10 players on the field at the time. Dorsett received the handoff from his quarterback, burst through the middle, eluded several defenders, and sprinted the remaining yards to the end zone. This performance has been lauded not only for its historical significance but also for its sheer athleticism displayed by Dorsett. Fast forward to 2018, when Derrick Henry equally captured the world's attention with his 99-yard rushing play. The Titans were also backed up near their end zone, just like the Cowboys in 1983. Henry took the handoff from the two-yard line, quickly broke through the defensive line, and then displayed his exceptional speed and power as he shed numerous tackles during his sprint down the field. His touchdown, like Dorsett’s, was the perfect combination of athleticism and remarkable determination. The Significance of This Astonishing Feat Achieving a 99-yard rushing play is an incredibly rare occurrence, as it requires multiple factors to align in sync. The offensive line must provide a solid opening, while the running back must display both the speed and power to break through the defense and maintain control down the length of the field. Moreover, this miraculous play is only possible when the team's offense is backed up to the one or two-yard line. The fact that only two players in all of NFL history have managed to pull off this remarkable accomplishment is a testament to the sheer difficulty of the task. This record further solidifies the legacy of these athletes, Tony Dorsett and Derrick Henry, who have earned their place among the greatest football players of all time. Conclusion The 99-yard rushing play stands as one of the most extraordinary achievements in the history of professional American Football. With only two instances occurring over the span of several decades, the record demonstrates the exceptional combination of skill, athleticism, and determination that these two phenomenal athletes, Tony Dorsett and Derrick Henry, exhibited. Whether a die-hard football fan or a casual enthusiast, one cannot help but appreciate the sheer brilliance of these rare, record-breaking moments that have captured the hearts and imagination of fans worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Question: Like with owning a kitten, what is a common danger when participating in the sport of fencing? Choices: - small cuts - puncture wound - competition - injury - panting The rationale to choose \\"small cuts\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"While all of the choices mentioned can be associated with the sport of fencing, \\"small cuts\\" is the most common danger when participating in this sport, similar to owning a kitten. To understand why small cuts are the most common danger in fencing, let's look at some of the other possible dangers and how they relate to the sport: 1. Puncture wound: In fencing, the participants use specially designed weapons that have a blunted tip to prevent puncture wounds. Modern fencing swords, such as the foil, epee, and sabre, are not meant to cause severe injuries to opponents. They are designed for precision and speed, and competitors wear protective gear to minimize the risk of a serious puncture wound. While accidents can happen, puncture wounds are not a common danger in this sport due to the equipment used and safety measures in place. 2. Competition: While the spirit of competition is a significant aspect of the sport of fencing, it is not inherently harmful. In fact, healthy competition can be beneficial for personal growth and self-improvement. It is not a danger in itself, but rather a motivation for fencers to improve their skills and enjoy the sport. 3. Injury: While more severe injuries can occur in fencing, such as sprains and broken bones, these are relatively rare compared to small cuts. Fencers wear layers of protective gear, including padded jackets, masks, gloves, and other specialized equipment to reduce the risk of injury. The nature of the sport, with its emphasis on agility and quick reflexes, means that fencers are often able to avoid strikes that could cause significant injury. 4. Panting: Panting is the natural response of the body in cases of physical exertion, like during an intense fencing match. While panting may be uncomfortable and indicate a lack of conditioning in some cases, it is not considered a significant danger in the sport of fencing. Small cuts, however, are the most common danger in fencing, as the weapons used in the sport are designed to make contact with the opponent's body. Even with the protective gear, fencers can still receive small cuts from the impact of the weapon or accidental scrapes during fast-paced movements. The risk of small cuts is a typical aspect of the sport, just as owning a kitten may result in occasional scratches from play or grooming. In conclusion, the rationale for choosing \\"small cuts\\" as the most common danger in fencing is that, although the sport has protective measures in place to prevent severe injuries, the nature of using bladed weapons and engaging in rapid movements can still lead to minor cuts. The sport of fencing is generally safe, and while other options may pose some danger, small cuts remain the most common risk associated with participation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Snow slides easily off needle-shaped leaves, keeping the load light and decreasing breaking of branches. These adaptations to cold and dry weather explain the predominance of conifers at high altitudes and in cold climates. Conifers include familiar evergreen trees, such as pines, spruces, firs, cedars, sequoias, and yews (Figure 14.20). A few species are deciduous and lose their leaves all at once in fall.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: How many miles does the does the coastal nation have sole exploitation rights over natural resources? \\"Freedom of the seas\\" is a principle in international law dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The \\"continental shelf\\" is the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margin's outer edge, or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater. Here the coastal nation has the exclusive right to harvest minerals and also living resources \\"attached\\" to the seabed. Answer:","completion":"The coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over natural resources within an \\"Exclusive Economic Zone\\" (EEZ) that extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers; 230 miles) from the baseline of their coastline. This zone is defined under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and allows the coastal nation exclusive rights to exploit resources, including minerals and living resources found within this specified area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tactical SAP route planning Add punctuation.","completion":"Tactical SAP (System, Applications, and Products) route planning is a crucial aspect of supply chain management, logistics, and overall business planning. It involves the optimization of transportation routes to minimize costs, improve efficiency, and meet customer demands. This process can be quite intricate, requiring a combination of factors, including geographical information, resource availability, and transportation constraints. In this context, tactical SAP route planning incorporates three main elements: route optimization, resource allocation, and customer satisfaction. These elements are discussed in detail below. 1. Route Optimization: Route optimization is the process of finding the most cost-effective, efficient, and shortest possible route for the transport of goods and services. It takes into account various factors, such as travel distance, fuel consumption, vehicle capacity, road conditions, and traffic patterns. By optimizing the route, companies can significantly reduce transportation costs, minimize delivery times, and optimize the use of vehicles and drivers. To achieve this, companies can leverage SAP route planning software that utilizes advanced algorithms to evaluate different route options and identify the best solution. The software considers multiple factors, such as shipment priorities, time windows, and vehicle restrictions, to ensure that the optimal route is chosen for each delivery. 2. Resource Allocation: Allocating resources effectively is vital in tactical SAP route planning. This involves assigning the right vehicles and drivers to each route while considering operational constraints and cost factors. Proper resource allocation ensures optimal utilization of vehicles and human resources, leading to reduced operational costs and improved productivity. In this regard, SAP route planning software can be employed to allocate resources efficiently, allowing planners to visualize resource availability, monitor performance, and make adjustments as needed. Companies can also use advanced features such as load consolidation and route balancing to further enhance resource allocation. 3. Customer Satisfaction: A primary goal of tactical SAP route planning is to ensure customer satisfaction by delivering goods and services on time and in excellent condition. This involves planning routes that not only minimize transit times but also take into account customer preferences, delivery windows, and special requirements. Ensuring customer satisfaction through proper route planning helps build long-term relationships, maintain a good reputation, and enhance overall business success. Various technologies, such as real-time GPS tracking and route optimization, can be utilized to provide timely and accurate delivery data, thereby ensuring that customers receive their packages promptly and securely. Furthermore, SAP route planning software often includes customer-centric features, such as order tracking and electronic proof of delivery, which enhance the overall customer experience. In conclusion, tactical SAP route planning is an essential component of effective supply chain management, playing a critical role in optimizing transportation routes, allocating resources efficiently, and ensuring customer satisfaction. By leveraging advanced software, companies can maximize the potential of their logistics processes, reduce operational costs, and improve overall business performance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Beijing (CNN) -- On a typical day, China's border with Myanmar is quite porous and vibrant. Often from the same ethnic groups, traders from both sides share much in common and do brisk business. I saw that up close during a reporting trip for CNN a few years ago. At one border town in China's Yunnan Province, I saw residents from both sides, speaking similar dialects, buying and selling produce, consumer goods, minerals and timber, before crossing back to their own country. We even brought back Myanmar bank notes as a souvenir from the trip. Scenes like this along the two countries' 2,000-kilometer border serve as constant reminders of long and deep bilateral ties. Other observers say","completion":"that these strong cultural, economic, and historical connections between China and Myanmar can be traced back centuries, highlighting the importance of their relationship in the region. Chinese presence in Myanmar dates back to the early years of the Ming Dynasty, and prominent Chinese merchants have played significant roles in Myanmar's history, with many maintaining a strong sense of loyalty to both nations. The border region serves as both a microcosm and a lifeline for this unique relationship. Due to shared ethnic groups like the Wa, Kachin, and Shan people, communities in these border areas often experience a blend of cultures and traditions, leading to a shared sense of identity that transcends national boundaries. This has helped foster a sense of fraternity among border residents, which in turn fosters greater tolerance and cooperation, further promoting the overall relationship between China and Myanmar. While trade and commerce play an integral role, these cross-border exchanges have been known to go beyond goods and services. Education, cultural programs, and even marriage are known to occur frequently among the border communities, further intertwining the lives and fortunes of both nations. These social and cultural exchanges serve to solidify the bond between the two countries and remind them of their shared roots, history, and aspirations. In recent years, infrastructure development and investment have further strengthened China-Myanmar cross-border cooperation. Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative has only galvanized their partnership, with ambitious projects underway to improve road and rail connectivity and boost international trade. While some controversy arises over the degree of Chinese influence and potential economic dependence, Myanmar has undeniably benefited from this relationship in terms of development and witnessed significant improvements in its infrastructure and connectivity. However, despite these constructive developments, the close ties between China and Myanmar have not been without challenges. Issues such as disputes over the border and the illegal trade of drugs, arms, and human trafficking continue to plague these regions, prompting both governments to enhance security measures and cooperation in order to curb these illicit activities. Additionally, ethnic conflicts in Myanmar's border regions, which often spill over into Chinese territory, have tested the resolve and diplomatic skills of both countries. Nevertheless, scenes of border communities along the 2,000-kilometer shared boundary between China and Myanmar demonstrate the undeniable strength, resilience, and potential of their partnership. As the world becomes more interconnected, nurturing these historical, cultural, and economic ties will only become more vital for both nations. Policymakers on both sides should recognize the importance of maintaining and enhancing mutual understanding and collaboration, even as they address the inevitable challenges that arise along the way. By continuing to foster cooperative cross-border relationships, China and Myanmar will be better positioned to meet the complex needs of their societies and contribute to regional stability and prosperity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: 1776 Movie plot: While General George Washington is conducting the struggle against the British Empire on the battlefield, the Continental Congress in Philadelphia piddles away its time over trivial matters and continually refuses to begin debating the question of American independence. The leader of the independence faction is the abrasive John Adams of Massachusetts, whose continuous pushing of the issue has brought their cause to a complete standstill. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania leads the opposition that hopes for reconciliation with England. During his quieter moments, Adams calls up the image of his wife Abigail Adams, who resides in Massachusetts and gives him insight and encouragement (these conversations are based on letters between the couple). Dr. Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania suggests another colony that supports independence should submit a proposal. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia voluntarily rides off to Williamsburg, Virginia to get authorization from the Virginia Colony to propose independence. Dr. Lyman Hall arrives to represent Georgia, and immediately, he is interrogated by his fellow delegates regarding his views on independence (with Dickinson framing it as \\"treason\\"). Weeks later, Lee returns with the resolution, and debate on the question begins. However, in the midst of debate, Caesar Rodney falters because of his cancer and is taken back to Delaware by fellow delegate Thomas McKean, leaving the anti-independence George Read to represent Delaware. After heated discussions, the question is called without a majority of positive votes present. The New Jersey delegation, led by Reverend John Witherspoon, arrives just in time to provide a vote supporting independence. In a move intended to defeat the resolution, Dickinson calls for a vote requiring unanimity for passage. The vote ends in a tie between the colonies, New York abstaining as it does in every vote. It is ultimately decided in favor of unanimity by John Hancock, president of the Continental Congress, who argues that any objecting colony...","completion":"Can't answer"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After achieving modest fame in Puerto Rico for his work in television commercials, Martin auditioned for membership in the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo. Although the executives enjoyed his dancing and singing at his first two auditions, Martin was rejected because he was too short. By the third audition, his persistence impressed executives, and in 1984, 12-year-old Martin became a member. A month after joining Menudo, he made his debut performance with the group at the Luis A. Ferre Performing Arts Center in San Juan. During this performance, he inadvertently disobeyed the choreography by walking around the stage, when it was planned that he would stay still, and was chastised by the band manager after the show: \\"The mistake was such a big deal that from that moment on, never again did I move when I wasn't supposed to move...That was the discipline of Menudo: You either did things the way you were told or you were not part of the group.\\" The song \\"Asignatura Pendiente\\" from Almas del Silencio (2003) was inspired by the first time Martin left Puerto Rico to tour with Menudo. Although Martin enjoyed traveling and performing onstage with Menudo, he found the band's busy schedule and strict management exhausting, and later reflected that the experience \\"cost\\" him his childhood. He considered leaving the group while on tour in Brazil, but ultimately decided to stay out of fear of media backlash and being sued for breach of contract. Martin also began struggling with his sexuality, noting the stark contrast between his status as a sex symbol and his own emotions. Despite this, Martin acknowledged his \\"opportunity to have so many amazing experiences with so many amazing people\\" during his time with the group. He developed an interest in philanthropy when the group became UNICEF ambassadors, often working with impoverished children in third world countries. His experiences as an ambassador affected him greatly and inspired him to continue working with charities later in life. By 1987, Menudo's record sales began to decline, and the group changed its image, adopting an edgier look and performing more rock-influenced songs. The band released the album Somos Los Hijos del Rock in Spanish, and to appeal to the Menudo's Filipino fanbase, the group released In Action, recording songs in both English and Tagalog. After recording 11 albums with the group, Martin left Menudo in July 1989, at age 17, hoping to rest and evaluate his career path. He performed his final show with the group at the same venue where he'd performed his first performance as a member. Martin returned to Puerto Rico to graduate from high school, and 13 days after turning 18, he moved to New York City to celebrate his financial independence; since he was a minor during his time as a member of Menudo, Martin was not allowed to access his own bank accounts. He was accepted into New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, but months before classes began, Martin dropped out and moved to Mexico City to perform in the play Mama Ama el Rock (Mom Loves Rock).

Article:Eighty percent of the Northern Ireland public support proposals currently before Stormont which will criminalise the purchase of sexual services. The new law is designed to curb demand for women trafficked into prostitution. But research has claimed a large majority of sex workers fear the proposal will put them at greater risk. 'Claire' advertises a full range of sexual services on a leading escort website. For part of the week she is based in Belfast, receiving between one and six clients a day, charging Â£90 for 30 minutes or Â£150 for a full hour. \\"I only work during the day. I'm not interested in people coming out of pubs drunk so I finish at 8pm.\\" She said she has turned away clients that have wanted to take drugs while with her. Working independently, without a \\"booker\\" or pimp, and working alone from a rented flat means she is not breaking the law. \\"I'm a law-abiding citizen.\\" she said. Referring to the criminalisation of paying for sex, she added: \\"Even though I would not be a criminal, I would be associated with criminals. I'm actually turning people into criminals, and that I don't like.\\" The well-spoken 46-year-old English graduate first considered a career as an escort after experiences as a swinger. But she describes the financial hardship, caused by her ex-husband stopping child support payments, as the \\"catalyst\\" that propelled her into prostitution. She plans to continue working for a couple more years, and is currently studying for two diplomas that will allow her to change careers. She said: \\"The idea is to clear some debts I got when I was a single parent. \\"I have no regrets about doing this job. It's not something that I'm desperate to get out of, but I feel it's something I need to be single to do, and at my age, maybe it would be nice to be with somebody.\\" She enforces a minimum age limit of 23 and her clients come from both blue and white-collar professions. She says some have disabilities, and others lack social skills to make contact with women. She also claims she has been visited by virgins aged from 24 to 40, as well as single men, and men in sexless relationships. She said: \\"When you're being intimate with someone you're more likely to tell them something.\\" She said many clients confided personal and emotional secrets in her. \\"There is a lot of counselling involved in this job,\\" she said. Claire feels that a licensing system, like that implemented in New Zealand, which decriminalises sex work, and establishes rules by which it can be policed, would benefit independent workers like her. The New Zealand model allows up to four women to work from the same property, and Claire feels this would increase her security, although she has never had any incidents of violence from her clients. In principle, a licensing system would also allow the police to focus their efforts on targeting trafficked and coerced sex workers. Some statistics suggest that cases of trafficked sex workers have declined in New Zealand since this system was implemented. Claire has not had any encounters with the PSNI, but feels wary that they could use their powers to move her out of her rented apartment if they wanted, even though she operates within the law. Ruth Jacobs is a writer and former sex worker, who worked in London. She said: \\"When I was selling sex, I was a drug addict. I was an absolute mess, but criminalising my clients wouldn't have helped me. It would have made things far more dangerous. \\"I wouldn't have used the term sex worker for myself because, although it was a way to make money, it wasn't work like another job. It was traumatic.\\" Ms Jacobs claims there was a hidden agenda behind the legislation Lord Morrow was proposing. She said: \\"I believe there's a lot of moral crusading going around, and pretending to want to stop trafficking, but really they want to end the purchasing of sex. \\"That's really dangerous because then trafficking victims aren't being served, and sex workers are denied their rights and put in danger,\\" she said. Ms Jacobs points to the policing model adopted in Merseyside, where the police have changed their focus from enforcement to protection of sex workers. They have classified sex workers as a minority so attacks against them are considered hate crimes. They work with outreach projects to help enforce area where prostitutes operate, and provide exiting services. \\"Exiting services are really important,\\" said Ms Jacobs. \\"Counselling, help with housing, referral to other services. When you've got no qualifications and no work history, these things aren't minor. People can't leave sex work if they can't make money some other way.\\" 'Anna' is a Romanian woman who was abducted from London in 2011 and flown to Ireland where she was forced into sex work under the threat of violence to her and her family. After nine months, her traffickers had moved her to Northern Ireland and she was able to escape. She believes that criminalising the purchase of sex would help people in the situation she was forced into. Referring to criticism that the bill may drive trafficking further out of reach of the authorities, she said: \\"This is already underground. The only thing that will go underground would be the sex industry which would have to lose their major income. \\"Their companies will go underground, not the girls who are used and abused.\\" She said: \\"I would be really really happy if it would pass. Definitely it would be a good decision for everybody within Northern Ireland.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The article discusses the public support for criminalizing the purchase of sexual services in Northern Ireland to curb the demand for women trafficked into prostitution.

Wendy Carle's impending eviction from her makeshift tent home exemplifies the widening gap between the wealthy and the struggling members of society. While high-tech office buildings cast their reflections on the shiny windows, Wendy wonders how such prosperity can exist just blocks away from the desperate situations faced by individuals like herself. In a landscape where countless opportunities and immense wealth abound, the sight of eviction notices being taped to tents of the homeless serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing issues that need to be addressed. These imbalances are not just unique to Wendy's case, but resonate across the entire nation, as the benefits of economic growth are not proportionately shared among all segments of the population. It is evident that while some may bask in the sunshine of Silicon Valley's success, others must brace themselves against the biting winds of the chilly storm, grappling with a harsh existence that falls far short of the American dream. Through Wendy's story, we are called to examine the root causes of this glaring inequality, and work towards a society that offers equal chances for everyone to succeed regardless of their background or financial standing.

We spend our one-hour class discussing two or three of the paintings,many of which are by artists that we have already studied in class. The professor begins by selecting one work of art.After giving us a quick background on the artist,he'll open up for our class discussion.Everyone is strongly encouraged to give opinions about the work.Not every piece we study is necessarily famous or striking in appearance and subject matter.Yet we always manage to make some interesting observations. In America,professors always take every opportunity to push textbooks aside and expose students to real world experiences. With some creativity, almost any subject can be applied to such beyond classroom learning.My art history class trips to the gallery are but one example. Many other subjects also offer opportunities to learn outside the classroom,such as business,psychology, art,journalism and biology. A friend of mine from Yale taking an advanced psychology course spends every Saturday working with mentally disabled children.Her mornings are spent staying with the kids and studying their sometimes uncontrolled behavior.Then in the afternoon she writes a report on her observations. Students generally appreciate these unique learning opportunities. They're almost always fun and interesting,and professors like them because students learn so much in just a few short months.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: One sign of a toxic parent-child relationship is if your parents do not acknowledge your accomplishments in appropriate ways. This could mean that your parents either refuse to acknowledge when you accomplish something, or that your parents dismiss your accomplishments. Some parents may even ridicule your accomplishments. For example, if you get a good grade on a test, your parents should congratulate you for this accomplishment. If your parents are toxic, then they might ignore what you said, change the subject, make fun of you for being a nerd, or say something like, “So what? It’s just a test.” It is normal for parents to want to guide you, but parents who try to control your behavior may be toxic. This may range from small decisions like what to wear to school to larger decisions like where to go to college or what to major in. If you think that your parents exert a high amount of control over your decisions, then they may be toxic. For example, a parent who encourages you to make your own decisions might ask you questions about where you want to go to college and why; however, a parent who is exerting control over your decisions might tell you where you are going to attend college. Parents who have healthy relationships with their children show their emotional bond by making eye contact with their children, smiling at them, and offering affection in the form of hugs. If your parents have toxic behaviors, then they might not do any of these things. For example, a parent who shows appropriate emotional connection with his child might comfort her if she is crying; however, a parent who lacks an emotional connection with his child might ignore the child or yell at her to stop crying. Healthy boundaries are important in parent-child relationships. If you have good boundaries with your parent, then you should not feel like your lives are one and the same. For example, a parent who has healthy boundaries with her child might ask how her child's friends are doing, but would not insist on hanging out with her child and his friends. Verbal abuse is another form of toxic parenting. If your mother or father call you names, put you down, or just say things to hurt your feelings, then these are all forms of verbal abuse. For example, your parents should say things to build you up and make you feel good about yourself; however, you would feel bad if your parent said something like, “You’re worthless!” or, “I can’t stand to be in the same room with you!” Some parents will be kind and reassuring one day and then mean and critical the next day. But keep in mind that this is still verbal abuse, even if your parents are not always cruel to you. Parents who are too focused on themselves to notice their children or to treat them properly can also be toxic. If your parents ignore you completely or only acknowledge you when you are doing something that they can brag about to friends, then this is an example of narcissistic parenting and it is toxic. For example, your parents should encourage you in your interests. A narcissistic parent, however, might only pay attention to you if your interests give him something to brag about, such as by telling all of his friends that you won a scholarship, even though he never asks about your studies or encourages you. Some narcissistic parents may have a personality disorder (PD). A person with PD displays self-centeredness, refusal to accept personal responsibility, constant self-justification, a strong sense of entitlement, and shallow emotions. A parent with PD might treat children like a burden or roadblock to her own personal goals. She will typically rely on emotional manipulation to control her kids. People with PD are often hypercritical of their children and can be physically abusive or prone to endangering their child’s welfare. Some parents are too immature or have other problems (such as addiction) that make it hard for them to be effective parents, so a child ends up taking on some parenting duties. Consider whether you had to take on any parenting roles because your parent was not able or willing to care for you and/or your siblings. These may include things like cooking, cleaning, and caring for other children. Sometimes parents assign cooking and cleaning chores to teach children responsibility, but toxic parents may heap many responsibilities on one child to avoid having to do these things themselves. For example, a toxic parent who does not want to cook or clean may shirk these responsibilities and force one of his children to do all of the cooking and cleaning instead. Some children feel unloved even though their parents say that they love them regularly, because they don’t see this love reflected in how they are treated. Make sure you aren’t assuming you know how your parents feel about you without good reason. For example, a parent who regularly says “I love you,” but who often ignores her children is not behaving in a way that shows love. Likewise, a parent who says that she wants her children to be independent, but never allows them to make any decisions is not behaving in a way that demonstrates what she says she wants. Summary:","completion":"A toxic parent-child relationship can be identified through certain signs and behaviors exhibited by parents. These may include not acknowledging a child's accomplishments appropriately, exerting control over their child's decisions, lacking emotional connections, violating healthy boundaries, verbal abuse, narcissistic parenting, having a personality disorder, being immature or having addictions affecting their parenting abilities, and making the child take on parenting duties. These actions can lead to the child feeling unloved, unsupported, and often confused about their parents' feelings towards them. It is important to recognize and address these toxic behaviors to ensure a healthy and nurturing relationship between parents and their children."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: For Anthony Mann the Western was 'legend'- and 'legend' makes the very best cinema!

He offers all the reserves of anger, inner ambivalence, and emotional complexity in his nature that his audiences had, up till this time, failed to catch... A carefully chosen cast increases the proceedings in fine style: Shelley Winters is at her saucy best; Dan Duryea perfect as the vicious, sneering psychopathic villain; John McIntire great as the unscrupulous character; Charles Drake so good as the man who attempts to face his tormentor; and a very young Rock Hudson, attempts the role of an Indian Chief... \\"Winchester '73\\" is the story of a perfectly crafted and highly prized, rifle in the Dodge City Kansas of 1876...

What gives the pursuit an element of the demonic, is Stewart's determination to revenge his father's death at the hands of that same renegade brothera revenge fed by long-standing fratricidal hatred... Photographed in gorgeous Black & White, the film comes on as powerful and arresting, acted with deep feeling and intense concentration, not only by Stewart but by all the supporting characters...

The jack hammer is often incredibly loud and generates a high amount of noise. Carson wants to protect himself from this noise, but he also needs to be able to hear the orders given to him by his boss on the site. But I can use this background: Electronic ear protectors work differently. They identify high-amplitude sound waves and send sound waves through them in the opposite direction. This causes destructive interference with the waves, which reduces their amplitude to zero or nearly zero. This changes even the loudest sounds to just a soft hiss. Sounds that people need to hear, such as the voices of co-workers, are not interfered with in this way and may be amplified instead so they can be heard more clearly. This type of hearing protector is recommended for higher noise levels and situations where it’s important to be able to hear lower-decibel sounds. What is an answer for this question: Would electronic ear protectors be appropriate for Carson, yes or no?","completion":"Yes, electronic ear protectors would be appropriate for Carson.

They had been inseparable since childhood, often spending their afternoons playing and exploring the quaint town's treasures. Many years passed and as they reached adulthood, George acquired a fortune left to him by his uncle. Feeling a strong sense of camaraderie and brotherly love towards his friends, he decided to share the wealth with Cronshaw and Tom. The three promised to use the newfound wealth responsibly and only for good. However, unbeknownst to George, Cronshaw and Tom were secretly conspiring to split his fortune behind his back. One day, George decided he needed a vacation, for he felt exhausted and overwhelmed by his responsibilities. He booked a trip to a beautiful seaside resort and invited his friends to join him, hoping the time would help them all to unwind and bond once more. On their arrival, they discovered that among the other visitors was Gertrude Wilmot, a mysterious woman who was somewhat of a local celebrity. She was known for her beauty and charm but also her expert ability to talk nonstop rendering everyone around her speechless. As it turned out, Gertrude was staying at the same resort, and during their stay, all three friends had the opportunity to get acquainted with her. While everyone seemed to be enthralled by Gertrude's captivating stories, Vyner, a weary guest who was fed up with lying admirers, sought solace elsewhere. He wandered around the hotel garden to escape the incessant chatter and found himself eavesdropping on a conversation he wished he hadn't. Cronshaw and Tom were discussing their plot to swindle George and share his inheritance, fully intending to cut George out of their scheme and ultimately, their friendship. For the next few days, Vyner wrestled with the burden of this terrible knowledge. He grappled with the moral dilemma, wondering whether or not to expose the disloyalty of George's friends. Meanwhile, George made no secret of his irritation and displeasure with the excess of Gertrude's presence. Her constant barrage of words drowned out even the most beautiful sunsets and she always seemed to be in the thick of things, frustrating him further. One evening, as the group sat around the fire reminiscing about old times, George began to complain about life's injustices. He expressed his annoyance that people like Tom never had to work for their good fortune. This struck a nerve as his friends exchanged uncomfortable glances. Cronshaw and Tom shifted uneasily in their seats, while Vyner's internal turmoil boiled over. Unable to bear witness to George's genuine friendship and unwavering trust in his friends any longer, Vyner stepped forward and revealed the treachery of Cronshaw and Tom. George's eyes widened as he listened, dumbfounded, while Cronshaw and Tom looked positively sheepish as they tried to establish plausible deniability. It was Gertrude, unmoved by the unfolding drama but still relishing an opportunity to quench her thirst for gossip, who provided the enduring commentary of the now infamous incident. As it turned out, Gertrude was not only an excellent chatterbox but a compelling storyteller as well, painting a vivid picture of the betrayal which unfolded before her. In the aftermath of Vyner's shocking revelation, George could no longer see his childhood friends through the same loyal lens. They were no longer the trusted companions that he had once shared laughter with, but thieves who sought to take advantage of his kindness and generosity. With a heavy heart, George severed all ties with Cronshaw and Tom and vowed to start anew, with friends who were faithful and true. As for Gertrude, she never stopped talking, and her tales of the treachery at the seaside resort quickly spread like wildfire throughout Rentonville. While many came to learn the hard way that it is advisable to maintain a safe distance from her, she became an indelible part of the history of that fateful summer, carving her unique place in the memories of all who were there. And so, George learned a valuable lesson about loyalty and the value of true friendship. Armed with the knowledge of his riches, he vowed to use his wealth for the benefit of others and set out on a journey to forge new friendships, leaving behind the ghosts of twisted loyalties and betrayal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to Finnish","completion":"Arvoisa komissaari, olemme ankarasti arvostelleet Nizzan huippukokousta, mutta se on kuitenkin antanut teille arvokkaan välineen: sosiaalisen asialistan, joka laadittiin tavoitteena tehdä Euroopan unionista maailman kilpailukykyisin talous, kuten Lissabonin huippukokouksessa päätettiin. Nizzan huippukokousta on kritisoitu monista syistä, mutta on tärkeää huomata, että se on tuonut mukanaan myönteisiä saavutuksia ja tavoitteita. Sosiaalinen asialista on yksi tällainen saavutus - se on suunnitelma, jonka avulla Euroopan unionin on tarkoitus saavuttaa merkittävä asema maailmantaloudessa, ja joka kuvastaa Euroopan yhteistä päämäärää ja solidaarisuutta. Sosiaalisen asialistan keskeiset osa-alueet ovat muun muassa työllisyys, sosiaalinen osallisuus, koulutus, elinikäinen oppiminen, ammatillinen koulutus ja työmarkkinoiden joustavuus. Tavoitteena on luoda parempia ja laadukkaampia työpaikkoja, lisätä työvoiman osaamista ja ammattitaitoa sekä torjua köyhyyttä ja sosiaalista syrjäytymistä Euroopan unionissa. Lissabonin huippukokous oli merkittävä virstanpylväs Euroopan unionin historiassa, ja sen päätöslauselmat linjasivat tulevaisuuden suuntaviivoja ja tavoitteita. Tässä yhteydessä pyrittiin panemaan alulle laaja strategia Euroopan taloudellisen kilpailukyvyn parantamiseksi, ja sosiaalinen asialista oli yksi sen keskeisistä elementeistä. Tämä oli tarkoitus saavuttaa etenkin investoimalla koulutukseen, tutkimukseen ja innovointiin sekä edistämällä yhtenäismarkkinoiden toimintaa ja kilpailukykyä. Nizzan huippukokouksen jälkeenkin sosiaalinen asialista on jatkanut kehittymistä ja mukautumista muuttuviin haasteisiin. Euroopan unioni on sitoutunut edistämään työllisyyttä, sosiaalista osallisuutta ja yhdenvertaisia mahdollisuuksia kaikille kansalaisilleen. Tämä on erityisen tärkeää nykyisessä globaalissa taloustilanteessa, jossa nopeat muutokset ja elinkeinorakenteen uudistuminen luovat jatkuvasti uusia haasteita Euroopan unionille. Lopuksi on todettava, että vaikka Nizzan huippukokouksesta saattoi aiheutua kritiikkiä, sen tarjoama sosiaalinen asialista on osoittautunut vahvaksi ja kestäväksi välineeksi Euroopan unionin kilpailukyvyn ja yhteiskunnallisen eheyden edistämiseksi. Se on auttanut jakamaan yhteisiä arvoja ja päämääriä unionin jäsenvaltioiden kesken ja tarjonnut konkreettisia keinoja niiden saavuttamiseksi niin kansallisella kuin yhteisötasollakin. Jatkamalla yhteisen vision ja tavoitteiden toteuttamista voimme yhdessä varmistaa, että Euroopan unioni säilyttää asemansa maailman kilpailukykyisimpänä taloutena ja tarjoaa parhaat mahdollisuudet menestykseen ja hyvinvointiin kaikille sen kansalaisille."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: The hospital in the southern city of Gjirokaster said a total of 700 have sought treatment since June for the effects of planting, harvesting, pressing and packing the cannabis in the village of Lazarat. “In the last two months about seven to eight people arrive in the emergency ward each day and many more have come earlier with disorders from hashish,” Gjirokaster doctor Hysni Lluka told Top Channel television. Some 2,000 people, including poor Roma who have set up a camp near Lazarat, have been working for months in the cannabis fields, where producers pay eight euros per 10 kilos of processed drug. The illegal practice has flourished in Lazarat over two decades of turbulent transition in Albania since the end of hardline communist rule. Lazarat has become a byword for lawlessness in Albania, with cannabis growers brazen enough to shoot at police officers who venture near their fields. Aerial pictures suggest some 60 hectares have been cultivated in Lazarat with 300,000 cannabis plants, capable of yielding 500 metric tons (551.156 ton) or half the total cannabis production in Albania. Lluka, the doctor, said women and teenagers, who account for some 40 percent of those working in Lazarat, had sought help for bouts of vomiting, stomach pain, irregular heart beats and high blood pressure. Last week one patient came in a critical state. Lazarat is a stronghold of the Democratic Party, which was in power for eight years before losing a June election to the Socialist Party. The Democrats promised to tackle Albania’s cannabis problem but police shied away from striking Lazarat. Artan Didi, the new director of police appointed by the Socialists, has said the police will no longer “back down to Lazarat”. The U.S. State Department’s international narcotics control report for 2013 listed Albania as a transit and destination country for cannabis, heroin and cocaine. Authorities seized more than 21 tons of cannabis in 2012, double the amount of the previous year, it said, although that could reflect increased production.

Answer the following question: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

If multiple payments will be made, agree on specific dates for the payments. Especially if you're lending money to a friend or family member, it may seem a little extortionate to charge interest. But there are several good reasons why you may want to charge the person you're giving money to a little bit of interest: If you're giving away money without interest, you're losing money. You're losing purchasing power (the ability to buy and invest with the money you're lending) and inflation is outstripping your money. If you charge someone interest, the borrower may be more likely to pay you back quicker than had you not. Think about it: Interest lasts as long as the life of the loan, so if the borrower holds on to the money longer, they'll end up paying more interest. Don't charge more than 15% or 20%. In fact, interest rates above 15% or 20% might not even be allowed under predatory lending laws. So keep the interest rate at something manageable and both parties will be happy.

But, it's important not to charge too much interest - no more than 15% or 20%. To make sure everyone agrees, you should write down the details, have everyone sign it, and maybe even have a witness.

Moore chronicles how GM had previously defined his childhood while growing up in Flint, Michigan, and how the company was the primary economic and social hub of the town. He points out that Flint is the place where the 1937 Flint Sit-Down Strike occurred, resulting in the birth of the United Auto Workers. He reveals that his heroes were the Flint natives who had escaped the life in GM's factories, including the members of Grand Funk Railroad, Casey Kasem, the spouses of Zubin Mehta (Nancy Kovack) and Don Knotts, and \\"Flint's most famous native son,\\" game show host Bob Eubanks.Initially, he achieves his dream of avoiding the dreary tradition of blue-collared factory life that lays for the majority of the population of Flint; by moving to California and working for a magazine in San Francisco, but this venture fails for him and he ultimately travels back to Flint. As he returns (in 1985), General Motors announces the layoffs of thousands of Flint auto workers, the jobs of whom will go to cheaper labor when the plant relocates to Mexico. GM makes this announcement even though the company is (according to Moore) experiencing record profits.Disguised as a TV journalist from Toledo, Ohio, Moore interviews some auto workers in Flint and discovers their strong antipathy to General Motors chairman Roger B.

Write highlights for this article: The Food and Drug Administration announced Friday it will deny the National Resources Defense Council's petition asking it to prohibit the use of bisphenol A, commonly known as BPA, in products manufactured in the United States. However, the federal agency stressed the announcement is not a final safety determination and it continues to support research examining the safety of BPA. In 2008, the council submitted a petition asking the FDA to regulate the use of BPA in human food and food packaging. The FDA had been silent since the petition was filed more than 41 months ago. The council finally, last December, sued the administration to get some form of action. Friday's announcement is a response to that suit. BPA is a chemical used in many consumer products, including clear and hard plastics called polycarbonate used in water and soda bottles, as well as in the resin linings of food and beverage cans and containers of infant formula. The Natural Resources Defense Council responded by saying it believes the FDA \\"made the wrong call.\\" \\"BPA is a toxic chemical that has no place in our food supply,\\" said a statement from Dr. Sarah Janssen, a senior scientist in the council's public health program. \\"The agency has failed to protect our health and safety in the face of scientific studies that continue to raise disturbing questions about the long-term effects of BPA exposures, especially in fetuses, babies and young children,\\" the statement said. \\"The FDA is out of step with scientific and medical research. This illustrates the need for a major overhaul of how the government protects us against dangerous chemicals.\\" The Natural Resources Defense Council says the FDA's approval of BPA for use in packaging food \\"results in human exposure\\" to the chemical and is \\"dangerous to those who use the products.\\" It says studies have linked BPA exposure to a number of dangerous side effects, including defects in newborns, harm to the central nervous system, increased rates of prostate and breast cancer, and metabolic changes in the body that lead to obesity and insulin resistance, which are the main causes of diabetes. In a separate news release, the council noted a group of 38 scientific experts recently published a statement saying the evidence of adverse effects of low doses of BPA from laboratory experiments on mice \\"is a great cause for concern with regard to the potential for similar adverse effects in humans.\\" The FDA, which has been getting pressure regarding BPA exposure from other food safety groups as well the Natural Resources Defense Council, is working to remove the chemical from baby bottles and sippy cups, steps already taken by some states, such as California. Many food manufacturers have removed or are considering removing BPA from their packaging. Campbell Soup Co. recently announced it would be taking BPA out of its cans.

Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: James wanted to add space for an extra guest, so he bought a hide bed sofa. With that he'd be able to have two people stay over, one in the guest room, and one on the sofa. Where might he have been? Possible A: hotel, guest room, office, apartment, house Why is \\"house\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"The answer \\"house\\" is aligned with human common sense for several reasons. First, the context of the question indicates a personal space. James is making a personal decision to add a hide bed sofa to accommodate another guest, which suggests he is in a space that he has control over. Hotels, offices, and even some apartments have furnishing policies that limit the extent to which individuals can bring in or change furniture. Second, the question mentions a guest room. While it's possible for apartments to have guest rooms, it's more common for a house to have an extra room that can be designated as such. A guest room is less likely in a hotel or office setting as these usually have specific rooms for specific functions. Third, the initiative to accommodate more people suggests a situation more common in a home or house setting. A residence like a house allows for such personal accommodations and modifications. It is common for house owners to rearrange or add furniture based on their needs which seems to be the case with James. Thus, considering the level of control over the space, the presence of a guest room, and the personal nature of the decision, \\"house\\" is a plausible answer and makes sense in this context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Anna Riviere was one of the most admired of 19th-century English sopranos . She was also one of the most adventuresome. She was born in London on January 9th, 1810. She entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of 14. Seven years later, just after her first show, Anna married Sir Henry Bishop, who was 24 years her senior. Her reputation as a singer grew rapidly, based largely on her tours with Sir Henry and harpist Nicholas Bochsa. After a tour of Dublin, Edinburgh, and London, Anna Bishop deserted her husband and three children and ran away with Bochsa. From then on, Madame Bishop--as she continued to be known--traveled and sang as if her life depended on it. Between 1839 and 1843 she traveled to every major town in Europe, where she sang in 260 concerts. In the course of two years in Naples, she performed in 20 operas. In 1855 she and Bochsa sailed for Sydney, Australia. He died there the following year, and Anna went on to tour South America before returning to New York, where she married a diamond merchant. Then she began what proved her most dangerous adventure. After another American tour in 1866, she and her husband set sail across the Pacific. They were shipwrecked on a small coral reef, and for more than a month they drifted in a small boat before they finally reaching Guam. She had lost her music, her wardrobe, and her jewelry, but Madame Bishop was not to be stopped. She went on to Manila and began a concert tour that led to Hong Kong, Singapore, and India before she went back to England. After another two-year world tour she returned eventually to New York, where she gave her last public performance in 1883--at age 73. Meanwhile the husband she left behind, Sir Henry, had become famous for writing the music to lyrics that might eventually have been meaningful to Anna Bishop--\\"Home, Sweet Home.\\" Question: Sir Henry is a _ . - poem - singer - writer - composer","completion":"The article mentions that Sir Henry Bishop is famous for writing the music to lyrics.

Summarize this article: Researchers offered new evidence Tuesday linking sugar consumption with conditions that can lead to diabetes and heart disease in children, fueling the debate over the causes of health problems related to obesity. The study was designed to isolate the effect of added sugar in particular, as opposed to calories. Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, and Touro University California took soda, pastries,... ||||| TIME Health For more, visit TIME Health Fat was the food villain these past few decades but sugar is quickly muscling in to take its place. As rates of sugar-related disorders such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease climb, many experts believe that when Americans rid themselves of fat, they simply replaced it with sugar in all its forms. But proving that the rise of the chronic diseases was actually linked to higher sugar consumption is a challenge. Dr. Robert Lustig, from the department of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, who has made a name for himself publishing books and research addressing the question of sugar’s effects on the body, wanted clearer answers. Now, in a paper published Tuesday, he and his colleagues believe they have come up with the definitive evidence that sugar, as Lustig says, “is toxic.” In most lab studies, the doses of sugar that scientists test are quite high; they want to see what the effect is quickly and, depending on the research, they may not have time to wait to study the more gradual effects that might emerge. And in studies where people reduce the amount of sugar they eat, for instance, those people end up eating fewer calories overall, so it’s difficult to know whether any changes are due to the removal of sugar or to the drop in calories. Lustig and his colleagues think they’ve produced the “hard and fast data that sugar is toxic irrespective of its calories and irrespective of weight.” MORE: FDA Wants Nutrition Labels to Include More Detail on Added Sugars Lustig’s confidence comes from the unique study, described in Obesity, of 43 Hispanic or African-American children aged eight to 18 years old. He collected detailed food questionnaires from each of the adolescents to get an idea of the average amount of calories they ate per day, then designed a special menu for each of them for nine days that matched the total numbers of calories they would normally eat. The only difference in the nine-day diet was that most of the sugar the children ate was replaced by starch — the overall number of calories remained the same. The children weighed themselves daily, and if they were losing weight, they were told to eat more of the provided food in order to keep their weight the same throughout the study. “Everything got better,” says Lustig. Some of the children went from being insulin resistant, a precursor state to developing diabetes, in which the body’s insulin levels can no longer keep up with the pace of breaking down sugar that’s coming in from the diet, to insulin sensitive. MORE: Artificial Sweeteners Aren’t the Answer to Obesity: Here’s Why “We took chicken teriyaki out, and put turkey hot dogs in. We took sweetened yogurt out, and put baked potato chips in. We took pastries out and put bagels in,” says Lustig. “So there was no change in [the children’s] weight and no change in calories.” After nine days of having their total dietary sugar reduced to 10% of their daily calories, however, they showed improvements in all of these measures. Overall, their fasting blood sugar levels dropped by 53%, along with the amount of insulin their bodies produced since insulin is normally needed to break down carbohydrates and sugars. Their triglyceride and LDL levels also declined and, most importantly, they showed less fat in their liver. MORE: 7 Amazing Things That Happen to Your Body When You Give Up Soda Because some of the children lost weight, to convince themselves that the effects weren’t due to the small amount of weight that some of the children lost, Lustig and his team compared those who lost weight to those who didn’t during the study, and found similar improvements in both groups. “Up until now, there have been a lot of correlation studies linking sugar and metabolic syndrome,” says Lustig. “This is causation.” The diet he provided the children isn’t considered ideal from a health perspective — starches are still a considerable source of calories and can contribute to weight gain. But Lustig relied on the starches to prove a point in a scientific study — that the effect sugar has on the body goes beyond anything connected to its calories and to weight. “I’m not suggesting in any way, shape or form that we gave them healthy food,” he says. “We gave them crappy food, shitty food, processed food — and they still got better. Imagine how much even better they would have gotten if we didn’t substitute and took the sugar out. Then they would have gotten even better yet. That’s the point.” MORE: The Trouble With Sugar Free Kids Not everyone is convinced that the results definitely prove sugar, and not weight loss, is the culprit, however. Susan Roberts, professor of Nutrition, USDA Nutrition Center at Tufts University notes that because some of the children lost weight, it’s still possible that shedding the pounds helped their metabolic measures to improve. She also points out that the children self-reported their initial diet, which can often be inaccurate. “We know that a healthy diet and weight loss cause good metabolic changes, and although this study tries to attribute its effects to low fructose, in fact it is impossible to do that because of the study design.” Some experts are concerned for other reasons. They’re worried that the findings may shift attention away from what they consider to be the more fundamental issue — that overall, we’re eating too much. “Too much calorie intake is still the biggest problem,” says Dr. Mark Corkins, professor of pediatrics at University of Tennessee Health Science Center and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition. He notes that the study involved children who were obese already and consuming too many calories. “It’s an important study, and the facts coming out of it are very important. It means we need to look at sugars, and at the type of sugars and sugar intake. But I worry that people are going to hang everything on this when we still need to reduce consumption.” Lustig hopes that won’t happen as more data emerges that details how sugar is altering the body in unhealthy ways outside of its caloric contribution. That wasn’t the subject of the current paper, but he promises follow up studies based on this work that will address that. This study does hint however, at what might be happening. While there has been a lot of attention on the presence of belly fat and its connection to metabolic syndrome, the fact that the children saw improvements in the amount of fat in their liver suggests that might be an important way that sugar is contributing to chronic disease. Obese children and those with diabetes often suffer from fatty liver, a condition normally associated with alcohol abuse but increasingly common among non-drinkers who gain excessive amounts of weight. This new view of sugar could change the advice that doctors and government health officials give about eating the sweet stuff. Lustig’s hope is that the information is considered as the U.S. Department of Agriculture finalizes its latest Dietary Guidelines, expected by the end of the year, which delineate recommendations for what, and how much of different types of foods and nutrients Americans should eat. ||||| In October 2013, the Mexican Congress did the unthinkable. They passed a peso-per-litre tax on sugared beverages, as well as a similar tax on junk food. This, in a country where some counties still don’t have potable water and where the poverty rate is 52%. Last week, the Mexican Congress did something even more unthinkable. They gutted their tax, cutting it by half. This, despite soda tax revenues that topped 19bn a year, and despite a diabetes prevalence rate of 12% compared with the US rate of 9.3%. The tax caused sugary drink consumption in Mexico to drop 6%. The Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica (the public health officials) called this a success; Hacienda (the treasury department) called it a failure. Why did they gut the tax when it provided revenue to a cash-strapped exchequer? Health threat of sugar is vastly underestimated, study claims Read more ANPRAC, the Mexican Beverage Association, argued that the tax cost 1,700 jobs. But studies show that sugared beverages contribute to the death of 24,000 Mexicans each year, and cause disability such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, amputation, and tooth decay in tens of thousands more. Furthermore, the tax was passed with the promise that the money collected would be diverted to improve the Mexican water supply, but instead it just filled general coffers. The poor paid in, and got nothing back. The world is watching Mexico’s every move, as many governments consider imposing a similar tax. Despite Public Health England and Jamie Oliver advocating for a sugar tax, David Cameron has declared his opposition. He thinks there are “more effective ways” of tackling obesity than taxing sugar. If he thinks this problem is about calories, it’s not. If he thinks it’s about obesity, it’s not. It’s about type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes in the UK is 5.4%; lower than the US or Mexico. Yet the NHS spends £14bn a year on diabetes and its complications, never mind the other diseases attributable to soda consumption. Epidemiologic studies demonstrate that increasing dietary sugar consumption increases diabetes risk and prevalence worldwide, while clinical studies show that markers for metabolic health deteriorate with increasing sugar in the diet. However, these studies are all confounded by the inherent calories in sugar. Is sugar dangerous because it’s calories? Or because it’s sugar? Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jamie Oliver at the House of Commons, as part of his Sugar Rush campaign. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA Here at the University of California, we’ve attacked this problem head-on. Tuesday marks the release – in the journal Obesity – of our study, which dissociates the metabolic effects of dietary sugar from its calories and weight gain. Instead of giving added sugar to adults to see if they got sick, we took the added sugar away from 43 obese children who were already sick, to see if they got well. But if they lost weight, critics would argue that the drop in calories or the loss in weight was the reason for their improvement. Therefore, the study was “isocaloric”; that is, we gave back the same number of calories in starch as we took away in sugar, to make sure they maintained their weight. For nine days we catered their meals to provide the same fat, protein, and total carbohydrate content as their home diet; but within the carbohydrate fraction we took the added sugar out and substituted starch. We took the pastries out, we put the bagels in; we took the yoghurt out, we put the baked potato chips in; we took chicken teriyaki out, we put turkey hot dogs in. We gave them processed food – kid food – but “no added sugar” food. We reduced their sugar consumption from 28% to 10% of their calories. They weighed themselves every day; if they were losing weight, we told them to eat more. Sugar and Britain's obesity crisis: the key questions answered Read more We were astonished at the results. Diastolic blood pressure decreased by five points. Blood fat levels dropped precipitously. Fasting glucose decreased by five points, glucose tolerance improved markedly, insulin levels fell by 50%. In other words we reversed their metabolic disease in just 10 days, even while eating processed food, by just removing the added sugar and substituting starch, and without changing calories or weight. Can you imagine how much healthier they would have been if we hadn’t given them the starch? This study establishes that all calories are not the same (“a calorie is not a calorie”); substituting starch for sugar improved these children’s metabolic health unrelated to calories or weight gain. While this study does not prove that sugar is the sole cause of metabolic disease, it clearly demonstrates it is a modifiable one. The WHO advises cutting our sugar consumption to stop diabetes. Almost half of our daily consumption is in sugared beverages. The “iron law” of public health states that reducing the availability of a substance reduces its consumption, which reduces health harms. Taxation reduces “effective availability”, and is easy to implement. Some say this is a regressive tax: the poor suffer more. But type 2 diabetes is a regressive disease, and the poor already suffer more. Taxation has worked to control tobacco and alcohol. And taxation of soda worked in Mexico until its treasury caved in to pressure from industry. Mexico’s loss could be Britain’s gain – if Cameron learns a little nutritional science, and accepts that there are more lives and money at stake than there are people who might lose their job. ||||| Photo Obese children who cut back on their sugar intake see improvements in their blood pressure, cholesterol readings and other markers of health after just 10 days, a rigorous new study found. The new research may help shed light on a question scientists have long debated: Is sugar itself harming health, or is the weight gain that comes from consuming sugary drinks and foods mainly what contributes to illness over the long term? In the new study, which was financed by the National Institutes of Health and published Tuesday in the journal Obesity, scientists designed a clinical experiment to attempt to answer this question. They removed foods with added sugar from a group of children’s diets and replaced them with other types of carbohydrates so that the subjects’ weight and overall calorie intake remained roughly the same. After 10 days, the children showed dramatic improvements, despite losing little or no weight. The findings add to the argument that all calories are not created equal, and they suggest that those from sugar are especially likely to contribute to Type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases, which are on the rise in children, said the study’s lead author, Dr. Robert Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Benioff Children’s Hospital of the University of California, San Francisco. “This paper says we can turn a child’s metabolic health around in 10 days without changing calories and without changing weight – just by taking the added sugars out of their diet,” he said. “From a clinical standpoint, from a health care standpoint, that’s very important.” Added sugars — the extra sweeteners food companies put in their products, not the sugar that occurs naturally in foods like fruit – are a topic of growing debate. In February, the federal government’s Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended that Americans limit their intake of added sugars to no more than 10 percent of daily calories. In 2014, the Food and Drug Administration proposed that food companies include a line on their nutrition labels listing the amount of added sugars in their products. After the dietary guidelines committee issued its report earlier this year, the agency expanded on its 2014 proposal, saying that companies should also list a “daily percent value” for added sugars on their labels in line with the 10 percent recommendation. The proposed changes have been strongly opposed by the food industry as unscientific. The Sugar Association, a trade group, said the F.D.A. was “making assertions that lack adequate scientific evidence,” and the Grocery Manufacturers Association criticized the standards the agency used to establish the daily value as being “inadequate.” The newly released study is timely in part because it lowered sugar intake among children to roughly 10 percent of daily calories, the amount recommended by the dietary guidelines committee. For their study, the scientists recruited 43 children between the ages of 9 and 18 who were considered at particularly high risk of diabetes and related disorders. All the subjects were black or Hispanic and obese, and had at least one or more symptoms of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors that includes hypertension, high blood sugar, abnormal cholesterol and excess body fat around the waist. On average, the subjects had been getting about 27 percent of their daily calories from sugar. By comparison, the average American takes in about 15 percent, though children typically consume much more than this in part because they have the highest intake of sugar-sweetened beverages. The study authors paired the subjects with dietitians. They then replaced the sugary foods in their diets with other foods purchased from local grocery stores. The goal was not to eliminate carbohydrates, but to reduce sugary foods and replace them with starchy foods without lowering body weight or calorie intake. “Wherever there was food with added sugar in their diets, we took it out and we replaced it with a no-added-sugar version,” Dr. Lustig said. So instead of yogurt sweetened with sugar, the children ate bagels. Instead of pastries, they were given baked potato chips. Instead of chicken teriyaki – which typically contains a lot of sugar – they ate turkey hot dogs or burgers for lunch. The remaining sugar in their diet came mostly from fresh fruit. Because the scientists were working on a tight N.I.H. budget, they could only carry out the costly intervention for nine days. But in that short space of time, they saw marked changes. On average, the subjects’ LDL cholesterol, the kind implicated in heart disease, fell by 10 points. Their diastolic blood pressure fell five points. Their triglycerides, a type of fat that travels in the blood and contributes to heart disease, dropped 33 points. And their fasting blood sugar and insulin levels – indicators of their diabetes risk – likewise markedly improved. One expert who was not involved in the new research, Dr. Frank Hu of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said that the study “strengthens the existing evidence on the relationship between added sugar intake and metabolic disease.” “This kind of study is very difficult to do,” he said. “But it provides a proof of concept that in a high risk population, reducing consumption of added sugar can have multiple metabolic benefits.” Dr. Sonia Caprio, a pediatric endocrinologist and professor of pediatrics at Yale Medical School, said that although the study was small, “it addressed the issue in an original way and tried to isolate the effect of sugar on metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.” “This is an important area of research that might solve some of the metabolic issues that we are facing in children, particularly in adolescents,” she said. “This study needs to be taken seriously, and we need to expand on it.” Related: For more fitness, food and wellness news, “like” our Facebook page.

However, the French government forces Dreyfus to reinstate Clouseau as the Inspector of the Sûreté (as they had been planning to anyway, much to Dreyfus' chagrin) so that he can go to the fictional Middle Eastern nation of Lugash to investigate the theft of the fabled Pink Panther diamond, which has once again been stolen.Clouseau's investigation at the Lugash National Museum, which he nearly destroys with his klutzy ways, lead him to believe that Sir Charles Litton (Christopher Plummer), the notorious Phantom, is re-creating the most infamous heist of his career. Clouseau is delighted at this, and sees this as his only chance to get his revenge on Litton for framing him and temporarily sending him to prison (in the first Pink Panther film). Although Clouseau fails to uncover any leads into the theft, his bumbling allows him to survive several attempts on his life by a mysterious assassin. After staking out, and nearly demolishing, the Litton Manor in Nice, Clouseau is tricked into leaving France. He follows Sir Charles' wife, Lady Claudine (Catherine Schell) to a resort hotel in Gstaad, Switzerland, where his attempts to investigate her repeatedly fail.Meanwhile in England, Sir Charles reads about the theft and realizes that he has been framed. He goes to Lugash to investigate, encountering various underworld figures of old acquaintance, and foils several attempts on his life.

Unconventional group composition: The player's group consisted of 3 tanks, which is an unconventional approach. Typically, a dungeon or raid group would consist of 1-2 tanks, 2-4 healers, and the rest as DPS (damage per second) players. With 3 tanks present in the group, there was an increased amount of damage absorption, control, and survivability. This made it easier to manage and mitigate the damage output from the Eagle boss, ensuring the group did not suffer from many damaging attacks. 2. Coordination and synergy among players: The player's group likely had good coordination and communication among the 10 players, which allowed them to execute their roles effectively. Proper strategy and utilization of the available abilities by the tanks, healers, and DPS players ensured that the group could efficiently bring down the Eagle boss. 3. Experienced Players: The players in the group may have been experienced with the content of Zul'Aman (ZA) and each player's respective class, allowing them to perform optimally during the encounter. By understanding the different abilities, cooldowns, and mechanics, each player knew how to contribute to the success of the group, making the Eagle boss an easy target to defeat. 4. Understanding the Boss Mechanics: The players may have already been familiar with the mechanics and specific strategies needed for defeating the Eagle boss. This knowledge allows for better preparation, positioning, and execution during the encounter, making it easier to overcome the boss' abilities and strategies. 5. Timer Mechanic: As mentioned in the description, the Eagle boss was defeated well within the timer, which indicates that the group dealt with the boss mechanics and damage output efficiently. Timed encounters can often add an element of urgency and pressure for the players, but the group's success in defeating the boss within the allotted time speaks to their ability to handle the challenge effectively. Overall, the Eagle boss was not a difficult foe for the player and their unconventional group due to their composition, coordination, experience, understanding of the boss mechanics, and efficiency in defeating the boss within the timer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Its Global Economic Prospects report is forecasting 2.7% growth compared with the 2.3% seen last year. That slight strengthening will be driven mainly by improvements in emerging markets and developing economies, the Bank says. But there is heightened uncertainty after the US Presidential election, according to the report. The World Bank's new forecasts suggest we can expect the unconvincing global economic revival following the financial crisis to continue. Last year's growth figure was described as a \\"post-crisis low\\", with \\"anaemic\\" levels of investment and a further weakening of global trade. For emerging market and developing economies, the rise in interest rates in the US and the strengthening dollar also led to a \\"notable tightening of financing conditions\\" - which means credit that is either more expensive or harder to get. But the Bank still expects growth to accelerate in these countries, partly due to higher commodity prices, such as oil and metals, which many of them export. The Bank's economists also expect the slowdown in two large emerging economies, Brazil and Russia, to come to an end. For the developed economies the Bank forecasts continued weak growth of around 1.8%. That would be slightly better than 2016, but still slow compared to the period before the crisis. Uncertainty about future policies has increased following the British referendum on the European Union and, potentially especially significant for the global economy, Donald Trump's victory in the US Presidential election. The report includes an analysis of why the US matters so much to the rest of the world in terms of extensive trade and financial links. It notes that there is a great deal of uncertainty about just what policies Mr Trump's administration will pursue in office. And it says there is the potential for stronger US growth if Mr Trump implements proposals to cuts personal and business taxes and stimulates infrastructure investment. The report also looks at the possible impact of more barriers to international trade. This is not just about Mr Trump, though he has said he would increase some tariffs on imports and has suggested some existing trade agreements could be scrapped. The Bank says that globally, new trade restrictions reached a post-financial crisis high last year, and warns that emerging and developing economies would be most affected by more barriers. This could hit the economies of some of the worlds poorest country's hardest, the report warns, saying growth has been the main driver of poverty reduction for the last two decades. It says that if there was a return to the growth rates seen before the 2008 crisis, then extreme poverty could reduce to just 4% by 2030. However weak growth like seen in 2015 would only bring down such poverty to 9%. Next week, the International Monetary Fund will issue its economic outlook for 2017. But it's important not to compare its headline figures for global economic growth with the World Bank's.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What is similar to a cafe?\\" is in \\"In addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \\"bistro\\" means \\"quickly\\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer.

The passage you provided mentions several types of eating establishments in Paris that are similar to a cafe. These include: 1.

Brasserie: Originally, a brasserie was a tavern located next to a brewery, serving beer and food at any hour. The concept gained popularity during the Paris Exposition of 1867, where beer and other beverages were served by young women in costumes related to the national origin of the drinks. Nowadays, brasseries, like cafes, serve food and drinks throughout the day. In summary, a bistro and a brasserie are two types of eating establishments in Paris that are similar to a cafe.

Firstly, to be assigned the prominent role as the lead reindeer for Santa's sleigh, Rudolph must possess exceptional qualities that go beyond simply having a luminous nose. His physical strength, endurance, and agility would be crucial for him to lead the team efficiently, regardless of the weather conditions. Secondly, in terms of navigation, while Rudolph's glowing red nose primarily proves valuable during poor visibility, it is also likely that it remains beneficial even during clear weather. The red light could serve as a supplementary beacon for the rest of the team, helping them maintain formation and follow Rudolph's guidance. Moreover, Rudolph's iconic status as the ninth reindeer also places him in a natural leadership position in relation to the rest of the pack. Santa Claus' trust in Rudolph to guide the sleigh and make critical decisions during the course of their journey across the world is as important in clear weather as it is during challenging weather conditions. Furthermore, teamwork is a critical aspect of ensuring a successful journey for Santa Claus and his reindeer. For the team to work effectively, all reindeer must be in sync and follow a designated leader. Given Rudolph's experience and expertise, he would be able to manage the pack during clear weather, fostering a sense of cohesion and coordination. Lastly, through his perseverance and resilience amidst adversities, Rudolph has become a symbol of hope, inspiration, and motivation. His presence as the lead reindeer serves as a constant reminder of the importance of overcoming obstacles and embracing one's uniqueness. In this sense, whether the weather is clear or not, Rudolph's leadership inspires the pack to perform their best. In conclusion, while Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer's primary role is to guide the pack through inclement winter weather, it is safe to assume that he can effectively lead and navigate the team during clear weather as well. His physical attributes, navigational skills, leadership, teamwork, and symbolic significance all contribute to his ability to guide the pack in diverse weather conditions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Michigan will lose 2 million in federal funding and 600,000 in state funding to provide legal aid to the poor in 2003, according to Deierdre L. Weir, executive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's largest provider of legal services to the poor. Current federal funds of nearly 10.7 million from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) will drop to 8.7 million for next year, according to Weir. She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 census. LSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation, and according to the census, the state's poverty population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000. The state's legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some 600,000 of state funding. A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently 7.5 million in 2002 to 6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of poverty in the state. LAD will lose more than 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, nearly half of the state's total loss, said Weir. While difficult to measure, the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive significantly limited service. Cutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. \\"Local providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much service as we can with fewer dollars,\\" said Weir. \\"We will be providing more selfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal system on their own in routine matters, more assistance on the telephone, and less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters. Currently, Michigan has 13 legal aid agencies covering the state's 83 counties. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"How is Legal Aid and Defender Association planning to cope with the funding drops?\\" is \\"Making cutbacks in civil legal matters\\"?","completion":"Yes, that's right! The Legal Aid and Defender Association is planning to cope with the funding drops by making cutbacks in civil legal matters.

Write an article with the title: \\"Dr. Conrad Murray -- The Interview that Sunk Him\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Dr. Conrad Murray -- The Interview that Sunk Him Introduction: The Unfolding Story Dr. Conrad Murray, the infamous personal physician of Michael Jackson, has been a subject of controversy since the tragic passing of the King of Pop in 2009. While he was eventually found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, the interview that took place before his trial arguably played a crucial role in sealing his fate. In this article, we will delve into the specifics of the interview with Dr. Murray and shed light on the factors that contributed to his downfall. Step 1: The Background Before we analyze the interview, it's important to provide a brief background on the events leading up to it. Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, due to acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication. Dr. Murray was by his side and quickly became the center of the investigation. With allegations of negligence and inappropriate administration of medications, Murray's role in Jackson's death was put under intense scrutiny. Step 2: The Interview Months after Jackson's death, in an attempt to clear his name and share his side of the story, Dr. Conrad Murray agreed to participate in a tell-all interview. The interview, which was conducted by journalist Savannah Guthrie, aired on the \\"Today\\" show on November 8, 2011. It was one of the most highly anticipated interviews of the year and garnered widespread media attention. Step 3: The Incriminating Statements During the interview, Dr. Murray made several statements that would later be used against him during his trial. Among the most incriminating were his claims that he had administered propofol to Jackson numerous times before, left the room briefly while Jackson was under its influence, and returned to find him unresponsive. Additionally, he admitted to not immediately calling 911, stating that he was \\"not used to\\" dialing emergency services. Step 4: The Public Reaction The interview was met with mixed reactions from the public. Some sympathized with Dr. Murray, believing that he was a scapegoat in a larger issue surrounding Jackson's drug addiction. Others, however, condemned him as an enabler who contributed to Jackson's demise. The interview sparked fierce debate on social media platforms and news outlets across the globe. Step 5: The Legal Consequences Dr. Murray's candidness during the interview would prove to be his undoing. The admissions he made during the interview were used as key pieces of evidence during his trial. Many legal experts called the interview a \\"grave mistake,\\" as it provided the prosecution with compelling evidence against Murray. In November 2011, Dr. Conrad Murray was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to four years in prison. Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale The interview with Dr. Conrad Murray serves as a cautionary tale for those in the public eye, particularly during legal proceedings. Despite his intentions to clear his name, the interview ultimately provided damaging evidence that led to his conviction. As the saying goes, \\"anything you say can and will be used against you,\\" and in the case of Dr. Conrad Murray, his words proved to be his undoing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. Now, I have a new situation: There are two hydroelectric dams in North Dakota. Both of them has large lakes or reservoirs, reservoir A and reservoir B. Since North Dakota has one the lowest unemployment rates in the country, it's hard to find an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoirs. This year reservoir A could hire an engineer, but reservoir B failed to find an engineer. As a result, there is no one to regulate reservoir B. The engineer for reservoir A let the water out in the fall. But there was no one to do that for reservoir B. Answer this question please: Which reservior would most likely have excellent water quality, reservoir A or reservoir B? A:","completion":"Reservoir A would most likely have excellent water quality in comparison to reservoir B, given the circumstances. As described, the water level of the reservoirs in the provided background should be lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. This is done to prevent ice from damaging docks and other structures around the lake and allows for better water quality since a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. Reservoir A had an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoir, who let the water out in the fall following the correct seasonal regulation process. This enables the springtime snow melt and underground springs to replenish the reservoir, ensuring proper water level and excellent quality. The routine regulation promotes a healthier ecosystem and keeps the water clear and clean. On the other hand, reservoir B did not have an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoir. As a result, the water was not let out in the fall, and the seasonal regulation process did not occur. Therefore, reservoir B would likely experience accumulating contaminants due to stagnant water, which can lead to poor water quality. The lack of proper regulation could lead to potential issues such as ice damage, increased algae growth, and other adverse effects on the aquatic life and overall water quality. In conclusion, reservoir A, which had an engineer to regulate the water level following the seasonal regulation process, would most likely have the excellent water quality as compared to reservoir B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Q:Process: - Plates on the Earth&#x27;s crust move slowly past each other - As the plates move, they exert a great force - When the force is large enough, the crust breaks - The stress is released as energy - The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves - We feel the earthquake - suppose smaller pores in filter happens, how will it affect MORE or STRONGER earthquakes. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"The process of earthquake formation involves the movement of tectonic plates on the Earth's crust, the exertion of forces, and eventual crust breakage that leads to energy release in the form of waves. When we consider the smaller pores in a filter, it seems unrelated to the steps mentioned in the earthquake formation process. Therefore, we will assess the impact of this perturbation on the occurrence of more or stronger earthquakes by evaluating how smaller pores in filters might indirectly affect any steps in the process. Smaller pores in a filter could potentially have an indirect impact on the earthquake formation process in a few ways: 1. Water circulation and fluid pressure: Filters with smaller pores could affect the underground water circulation at fault zones. This could result in changes to fluid pressure within the Earth's crust, possibly influencing the forces acting on the tectonic plates. However, the relationship between smaller pores in filters and changes in fluid pressure would be highly dependent on the specific geological context and surrounding environment, making the overall impact difficult to predict. 2. Influence on erosion and sedimentation: Smaller filter pores can impact the movement of water during erosion and sedimentation processes, which can ultimately affect the amount of weight being placed on tectonic plates. Redistributions of mass on the Earth's surface can lead to shifts in tectonic stress, though once again, the overall effect on earthquake frequency and intensity remains highly dependent on local geological conditions. 3. Changes in pore pressure from filter usage: In certain cases, smaller filter pores may be utilized in industries that deal with fluid injections in the ground, such as hydraulic fracturing (fracking) for natural gas extraction. Although not directly related to the natural process of earthquake formation, the changes in pore pressure from fluid injections into the crust can influence forces acting on tectonic plates. This could, in turn, increase the likelihood or intensity of earthquakes, as has been observed in some regions with increased human-induced seismicity. In conclusion, smaller pores in filters do not directly impact the steps of earthquake formation, as there is no clear connection between filter pore size and the tectonic process. However, smaller pores in filters can theoretically have an indirect impact on the process by altering water circulation, erosion and sedimentation, or influencing forces through pore pressure changes in specific industrial applications. Ultimately, the impact of these changes on the occurrence of more or stronger earthquakes is highly dependent on the local geological context and environmental conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dr. McCrea didn't just give out glasses of wine for fun. You see, he's been doing this for 10 whole years. He found out that people in France, a country far away, have fewer heart attacks than people in his country, even though they eat more fatty foods and smoke more.

Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the City of God (Civitas Dei) or the City of Man (Civitas Terrena). Augustine's City of God is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis, held by many Christian Romans, that the Christian view could be realized on Earth. What is the answer to this question: Who heavily influenced the early Christian philosophy of Augustine of Hippo?","completion":"The early Christian philosophy of Augustine of Hippo was heavily influenced by Plato, a renowned Greek philosopher. Plato's ideas and teachings played a significant role in shaping Augustine's thoughts, particularly concerning the concepts of moral virtue, the role of the state, and metaphysical principles. Augustine integrated Plato's philosophy with Christian doctrines to create a unique synthesis of ideas, which subsequently had a profound impact on the development of Christian thinking and Western philosophy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Surveillance footage shows Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, better known as Anas al-Libi being grabbed from outside his Tripoli, Libya, home on October 5. Al-Libi, 49, was taken by Delta Force soldiers in a raid planned in co-operation with the CIA, FBI and the Libyan government. The raid has been described as precise as brain surgery and takes one minute. Al-Libi was transported to New York City where he is awaiting trial for his part in the 1998 bombings of the US Embassy's in Kenya and Tanzania. More than 200 people died in the attacks. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: A Close Look at Anas al-Libi's Capture: The Delta Force Operation and Al-Libi's Trial in New York On October 5, in a well-coordinated operation executed with the precision of brain surgery, the infamous Al-Qaeda leader Anas al-Libi was captured outside his home in Tripoli, Libya. The raid, a carefully planned effort by the United States' Delta Force, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Libyan government, lasted barely a minute. The successful capture of al-Libi, one of the most wanted terrorists in the world, was hailed as a significant win in the fight against terrorism and has paved the way for the ongoing trial in New York. This article delves into the details of the operation and the subsequent legal process that brought al-Libi to face his charges. Anas al-Libi was well-known among intelligence circles for being a key figure in the 1998 bombings of the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which resulted in the deaths of over 200 people. Along with his high-level involvement in Al-Qaeda's operational planning, al-Libi was a sought-after target by intelligence agencies and law enforcement in the United States. The operation that would lead to al-Libi's capture was swift and efficient. The combined strategy by the CIA, the FBI, Delta Force soldiers, and the Libyan government ensured that they had all of the actionable intelligence they needed to execute the operation with minimal risk to the soldiers and the Libyan people. The knowledge of al-Libi's daily routines was a critical factor in ensuring the success of the operation. In the early hours of October 5, Delta Force soldiers surrounded al-Libi's home in Tripoli while he was still inside. As he emerged from his residence, the highly trained operatives managed to apprehend him within mere seconds; a testament to the level of precision and skill required by this elite unit. Al-Libi was then quickly transferred to a nearby vehicle and transported out of the country. Following the successful capture, Anas al-Libi was transported to New York City, where he awaits trial for his part in the 1998 bombings of the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He faces a multitude of charges, including conspiracy to murder US nationals, bombing US government facilities, and using weapons of mass destruction during a terrorist attack. As the trial progresses in New York, it is essential to remember that this case highlights the importance of joint efforts by intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and military forces in the pursuit of international criminals and terrorists. The operation that led to the apprehension of Anas al-Libi stands as a meticulous example of cooperation between different branches of government and nations working together toward a common goal: ensuring the security of their citizens and bringing justice to the victims of these heinous crimes."},{"prompt":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film opens near the \\"last stop on the subway\\", a terminal in Alaska, which appears to be emerging from deep snow in the middle of nowhere.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I read this background article the other day: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. I am facing a new situation today: The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't.

A: However, by April 1927, Carl Laemmle considered this to be a mistake as \\"unclean pictures\\" from other studios were generating more profit while Universal was losing money. Does the answer correctly answer the question Options are: a. yes. b. no.","completion":"a. yes. Carl Laemmle, a prominent figure in the early American film industry, initially took a stance against \\"unclean pictures\\" – films with explicit or morally questionable content. He held a firm belief in distributing and producing only morally sound films to uphold the picture industry's reputation and protect its audiences from being exposed to distasteful content. However, over time, Laemmle's position on \\"unclean pictures\\" gradually evolved, predominantly due to two main factors: competitive market pressures and financial considerations. 1. Competitive Market Pressures: During the 1920s, the film industry experienced a significant transformation as it witnessed the rapid proliferation of more daring and risque films. These \\"unclean pictures\\" began to captivate and engage audiences with their sensational narratives, causing competitors to delve into this new territory in search of box office success. As other studios started producing films with bold and scandalous content, Universal Pictures, co-founded by Carl Laemmle, began to lose its market share. This increasing competition forced Laemmle to reconsider his stance towards \\"unclean pictures\\" to stay relevant and not fall behind other studios. 2. Financial Considerations: Laemmle's dedication to producing morally upright films was initially financially rewarding. However, by the mid-1920s, Universal Pictures started losing money due to its strict adherence to this policy. In contrast, films with explicit content from other studios were generating an increasing amount of profit, reflecting the audience's changing tastes and preferences. Realizing that the audience was more inclined towards these \\"unclean pictures,\\" Laemmle ultimately decided that his previous position on maintaining moral standards in film was no longer a feasible strategy. In April 1927, Laemmle made a significant shift in his policy and began producing and distributing films with content that he had previously deemed inappropriate. This change in stance was a pragmatic decision, undertaken to ensure Universal Pictures' survival and profitability amidst the growing dominance of \\"unclean pictures\\" in the industry. By adapting to the changing preferences of contemporary moviegoers and adjusting to the competitive market landscape, Laemmle demonstrated his cautious business approach and willingness to adapt to remain successful in the American film industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Rodriguez was born in San Antonio, Texas. Her mother, Carmen Milady Rodriguez (nee Pared Espinal), is Dominican, and her father, Rafael Rodriguez, was a Puerto Rican, who served in the U.S. Army. Rodriguez moved to the Dominican Republic with her mother when she was eight years old and lived there until age 11. Later, she moved to Puerto Rico until the age of 17, and finally settled in Jersey City, New Jersey. In March 2002, Rodriguez was arrested for assault after getting into a fight with her roommate, but charges were later dropped after the roommate declined to press the allegations in court. In November 2003, Rodriguez went to court to face eight misdemeanor charges based on two driving incidents including a hit and run and driving under the influence (DUI). In June 2004, Rodriguez pleaded no contest in Los Angeles to three of the charges: hit and run, drunken driving, and driving with a suspended license. She went to jail for 48 hours, performed community service at the morgues of two New York hospitals, completed a three-month alcohol program, and was placed on probation for three years. In 2005, while filming Lost in Hawaii, Rodriguez was pulled over by Honolulu police multiple times for speeding violations and on December 1 she was arrested for DUI. In April 2006, she pleaded guilty to one charge of driving under the influence and chose to pay a US500 fine and spend five days in jail. She cited her high doses of allergy-relieving steroids as part of the reason for her erratic behavior. Because the incident was a violation of her Los Angeles probation, she was sentenced to 60 days in jail, a 30-day alcohol rehabilitation program and another 30 days of community service, including work for Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Because of overcrowding, she was released from jail on the same day she entered. In September 2007, Rodriguez allegedly violated her probation by not completing her community service and not following an alcohol education program. Her lawyer claimed it was a clerical error. On October 10, 2007, following a hearing, she was sentenced to 180 days jail time after agreeing to admit to violating her probation. She was expected to spend the full 180-day term in jail, but she was released eighteen days later due to overcrowding. In January 2009, Rodriguez completed her community service.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What legal issues did she have","completion":"Well, sweetie, Rodriguez had some trouble following the rules. She got into a fight with a friend and also drove her car when she wasn't supposed to. She had to go to court, which is like a big meeting where people decide if you've done something wrong. Later, she got into some trouble again because she didn't follow the rules about driving, she drove too fast and also drove after having a drink which is very dangerous and against the law. She had to go to a place called jail because of this. But she didn't stay there for long because there were too many people there. Afterwards, she didn't do all the things she was supposed to do to make things right, like helping people in her community and learning more about why drinking and driving is bad. Because she didn't do these things, she had to go back to jail again. But just like the last time, she was let out early because the jail was too full. Finally, she finished all her tasks to help her community."},{"prompt":"Q:Given the question \\"What was Paul concerned about?\\" and the answer \\"His final exam.\\", write a conversation that might have happened.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is not much water free happens, how will it affect MORE butterflies. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that a decrease in available water would have an effect on the butterfly population. In this case, the lack of water can have both direct and indirect effects on the butterfly life cycle. Direct effects: 1. Hydration: Caterpillars and butterflies need water for hydration. Insufficient water may lead to dehydration, causing growth problems and a decrease in their overall health. This could result in a reduced number of butterflies successfully completing their life cycle. 2. Food resources: Caterpillars eat plant matter almost constantly as they grow. If the lack of water affects plant growth, the caterpillars may have a difficult time finding enough food, leading to malnutrition or starvation that impacts their ability to metamorphose into a butterfly. Indirect effects: 1. Reduced plant diversity: A reduction in available water can impact plant growth and overall biodiversity in the habitat. This not only affects the caterpillars' food sources but also the adult butterflies, as they rely on flowers for nectar. A reduction in plant diversity may lead to a decline in available food sources, resulting in a smaller butterfly population. 2. Impact on other species: The lack of water can affect other animals within the same ecosystem. This could alter predator-prey relationships, such as an increase in predation on caterpillars if other food sources for predators are scarce, further leading to a decline in butterfly populations. 3. Adaptation: Inadequate water sources could lead to butterfly populations adapting to new food sources, which may or may not support their life cycle as effectively. Some butterflies may be unable to adapt to these changes, resulting in a decrease in their population. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that a lack of water does have both direct and indirect effects on the butterfly life cycle. The direct effects include dehydration and reduced food resources, while the indirect effects involve reduced plant diversity, impacts on other species, and adaptation difficulties. Overall, these factors could indeed lead to a decrease in the butterfly population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Given the question: Information: - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - In ecology, a niche is a term with a variety of meanings related to the behavior of a species living under specific environmental conditions. The ecological niche describes how an organism or population responds to the distribution of resources and competitors (for example, by growing when resources are abundant, and when predators, parasites and pathogens are scarce) and how it in turn alters those same factors (for example, limiting access to resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and a consumer of prey). \\"The type and number of variables comprising the dimensions of an environmental niche vary from one species to another [and] the relative importance of particular environmental variables for a species may vary according to the geographic and biotic contexts\\". - In biological classification, subspecies (abbreviated \\"subsp.\\" or \\"ssp.\\"; \\"plural\\": \\"subspecies\\") is either a taxonomic rank subordinate to species, or a taxonomic unit in that rank. A subspecies cannot be recognized independently: a species will either be recognized as having no subspecies at all or at least two (including any that are extinct). - The bamboos are evergreen perennial flowering plants in the subfamily Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae. In bamboo, as in other grasses, the internodal regions of the stem are usually hollow and the vascular bundles in the cross section are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement. The dicotyledonous woody xylem is also absent. The absence of secondary growth wood causes the stems of monocots, including the palms and large bamboos, to be columnar rather than tapering. - In biology, a taxon (plural taxa; back-formation from \\"taxonomy\\") is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Michelia is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Magnolia family ( Magnoliaceae ) . The genus includes about 50 species of evergreen trees and shrubs , native to tropical and subtropical south and southeast Asia ( Indomalaya ) , including southern China . - In biological classification, rank is the relative level of a group of organisms (a taxon) in a taxonomic hierarchy. Examples of taxonomic ranks are species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, domain, etc. - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. - Beijing (formerly romanised as Peking) is the capital of the People's Republic of China and the world's third most populous city proper. It is also one of the world's most populous capital cities. The city, located in northern China, is governed as a direct-controlled municipality under the national government with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts. Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighbouring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast; together the three divisions form the Jingjinji metropolitan region and the national capital region of China. - Magnolia is a large genus of about 210 flowering plant species in the subfamily Magnolioideae of the family Magnoliaceae. It is named after French botanist Pierre Magnol. - Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants. - Liriodendron is a genus of two species of characteristically large deciduous trees in the magnolia family (Magnoliaceae). - The Magnoliales comprise an order of flowering plants. Classification. The Magnoliales include six families: - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - The Magnoliaceae are a flowering plant family, the magnolia family, in the order Magnoliales. It consists of two subfamilies: Magnolioideae, of which \\"Magnolia\\" is the most well-known genus, and Liriodendroidae, a monogeneric subfamily, of which \\"Liriodendron\\" (tulip trees) is the only genus. - The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds. - In botany, an evergreen is a plant that has leaves throughout the year, always green. This contrasts with deciduous plants, which completely lose their foliage during the winter or dry season. There are many different kinds of evergreen plants, both trees and shrubs. Evergreens include: - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs. - Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, identification and taxonomy. Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis. - In biology, a species complex is a group of closely related species that are very similar in appearance to the point that the boundaries between them are often unclear. Terms sometimes used synonymously but with more precise meanings are: cryptic species for two or more species hidden under one species name, sibling species for two cryptic species that are each other's closest relative, and species flock for a group of closely related species living in the same habitat. As informal taxonomic ranks, species group, species aggregate, and superspecies are also in use. - Deciduous means \\"falling off at maturity\\" \\" or \\"tending to fall off\\", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe. In a more general sense, \\"deciduous\\" means \\"the dropping of a part that is no longer needed\\" or \\"falling away after its purpose is finished\\". In plants it is the result of natural processes. \\"Deciduous\\" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer or deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, in some mammals (including humans).

Tommy Roye the husband of a BBC executive Victoria has been jailed for masterminding a plot to extort money from the chief executive of a media firm. The husband of a BBC executive has been jailed after he masterminded a blackmail plot against the head of a media firm. Tommy Roye, 39, demanded cash over a two month period, from innocent businessman Craig Farley-Jones, 37. Manchester Crown Court heard that Roye recruited two enforcers to have his victim’s car torched on his driveway because his business partner owed £30,000 to him and his associates. During a confrontation Roye told father of one Mr Farley-Jones: 'I will f**k you up now, you don’t know who you are messing with. I’ll f**k you up and put you in that skip over there'. In the run up to arson attack, the victims received menacing text messages reading: 'If you don’t reply within an hour we will send someone' Police called in by Mr Farley-Jones arrested Roye a day after the arson attack on his people carrier vehicle and found two ornamental Samurai swords and a machete at his home in Urmston, Greater Manchester. Father of one Roye has now been jailed for six years after being convicted of blackmail, conspiracy to commit arson and threatening to destroy property. Three accomplices were also jailed for their part in the plot. Roye’s wife Victoria, 41, a BBC Talent Executive for Entertainment North was not in court for the hearing.

However, we have been targeting organised crime groups at all levels for the last two years and have achieved some fantastic results. 'We are tackling these groups with every tactic open to us, taking away their liberty, their homes, their cars and their cash.' Earlier the Manchester court heard Mr Farley-Jones - chief executive of Jungle Media and who works with former Celebrity Big Brother winner Mark Bez Berry - ran a Cheshire nightclub with a childhood friend known as Marvin. It was said that trouble began in August 2012 after he fell into debt and called Mr Farley-Jones for help. Gary Woodhall prosecuting said Mr Farley Jones arrived at the pub to find Roye holding what appeared to be a gun and telling: 'You are a piece of sh*t, you are a liar. Not even your business partner will help you out’. Mr Farley-Jones offered to pay £5,000 himself to buy time for his friend but was assured by Marvin he would not have to pay a penny. The court was told that he later received a text from Roye saying: 'Why would you get out of bed in the middle of the night and agree to pay and then not pay’. The following October Mr Farley-Jones was in another pub when Roye and one of his enforcers who had been hiding in a garden, converged on the victim 'like hyenas'. Marcel Lauder, 44, (left) of Derby and Jamie Keegan, 31, of Sale, (right) pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit arson and blackmail at an earlier hearing. Lauder got 28 months and Keegan 24 months. Mr Woodall said: 'They surrounded Craig Farley-Jones. Tommy Roye was forceful and aggressive and demanded to know where the money was. Tommy Roye said he could deal with the problems there and then. 'Roye demanded the key to Craig Farley-Jones’ car and fearing he would be attacked, he handed over the key to his Audi car. Roye told him not to ring the police or \\"the car would be burned out - or the car driven through the house\\". Mr Farley-Jones again agreed to pay the money and the car was returned. But Roye then repeatedly contacted Mr Farley-Jones sending text messages referring to the victim’s house. When the victim replied saying that he would go to police, Roye’s menacing response was: 'Police? Call the fire service as well’. While Mr Farley-Jones was in a police station giving a statement. his Rodge Ram people carrier car was set on fire on his driveway. He later said the blackmail plot was 'soul destroying' and had a 'massive effect' on his life and he was forced to move out of the area as a result. His wife’s mental health deteriorated and he now felt isolated from family and friends. Fear had taken over his life, he said, and he now always looks over his shoulder when out and is afraid of answering the front door. Ashley Gusihard was jailed for seven years after being convicted of blackmail and unrelated charges of possessing drugs with intent to supply. Roye had 25 previous convictions including a wounding offence in 1992 when he slashed a man on the chin leaving a three inch wound. He also has convictions for drug possession and in 1995 was jailed for ten years for armed robbery. In mitigation his defence counsel Miss Bernadette Baxter said: 'He understands the impact it is going to have on his family and has ensured his wife and children underwent counselling for his inevitable prison sentence. 'He runs a successful business with his partner who is leading that whilst he is in custody. It was a short lived period of events - there was no direct violence.' Passing sentence Judge Adrian Smith told Roye: 'You were the instigator and organiser in the campaign of threats. 'Blackmail is designed to instil fear into the life of another human being. It’s a cruel offence and can seriously affect a life and those around him. 'You made chilling threats to burn his house down. This offence has impacted upon his life and family’s life in a serious way and is still ongoing.'

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I know that the answer to the question \\"What kind of fighting do battleships do?\\" is in \\"The aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval combat in World War II, because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare. The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had higher range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"Certainly! The kind of fighting that battleships engage in has evolved over time, particularly with the introduction of aircraft carriers during World War II. Traditionally, battleships were armed with large naval guns and engaged in direct combat with enemy ships. However, as air power became more significant in warfare, battleships began to operate alongside and support aircraft carriers, which could launch long-range, highly effective air strikes against enemy targets. In World War II, the versatility of aircraft carriers was demonstrated through operations such as the British HMS Illustrious strike on the Italian fleet in Taranto and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. These events showcased the power projection capability of a force of modern carriers, which could inflict substantial damage from a distance, without the need for direct combat. Despite the advantages of aircraft carriers, they remained vulnerable when engaged in close-range encounters with traditional battleships, as evidenced by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships in 1940. In conclusion, battleships primarily engage in direct combat with enemy ships, but their role has evolved to provide support for aircraft carriers in modern naval warfare."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Just because you have a business that you want to operate does not mean that a corporation is the best decision. You should consider the legal options that exist for a business operation in georgia : Corporation.","completion":"In Georgia, a corporation is a separate legal entity that offers limited liability for its shareholders. This means that the corporation's debts and liabilities are separate from those of its owners. It is often a good choice for businesses that plan to raise capital through the issuance of stock or have a large number of investors. Limited Liability Company (LLC). An LLC is a popular choice for small businesses and entrepreneurs because it combines the limited liability of a corporation with the simplicity and flexibility of a partnership or sole proprietorship. Owners of an LLC, known as members, are typically not personally responsible for the debts and liabilities of the business. Additionally, Georgia LLCs benefit from pass-through taxation, meaning profits and losses are reported on the owners' personal tax returns, eliminating the double taxation faced by corporations. Partnership. A partnership is an unincorporated business structure that is owned by two or more individuals, known as partners. There are different types of partnerships, such as general partnerships, where all partners share equal responsibility for managing the business and its debts, and limited partnerships, where only one or more general partners manage the business, while other limited partners provide capital and enjoy limited liability. Partnerships can be easier to form and dissolve but often involve greater financial risk for the partners involved. Sole Proprietorship. A sole proprietorship is the simplest business structure and is owned by a single individual. The owner has complete control over the decision-making process but also has full personal liability for the business's debts and obligations. This means that the owner's personal assets could be at risk in the event of business failure or a lawsuit. Sole proprietorships do not provide limited liability protection and are not a separate legal entity; therefore, they are not recommended for high-risk businesses. As you consider the various legal structures available in Georgia, you should keep in mind your objectives, the nature of your business, the potential risks involved, and your financial needs. Consult with an attorney or business adviser to determine which structure is the best fit for your organization, considering factors such as liability protection, tax implications, management control, and ongoing compliance requirements. Ultimately, the most appropriate business structure for your Georgia enterprise will hinge on your objectives and the specific circumstances surrounding your endeavor. Weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each business structure, as well as seeking professional advice, will aid you in making an informed decision that sets your company up for long-term success and stability."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here's what happens next in each option: I. The tutorial shows how to light the fire by rubbing a lid on it. In this section, an alternative method of creating a spark to initiate the fire-building process is taught. The tutorial explains that rubbing the edge of a lid, or another flat object with a rough surface, against a flint can also create a spark. The sparks are directed towards the tinder, which is a bundle of dry, highly flammable materials such as dried grass, leaves, or wood shavings. The tutorial emphasizes the importance of having the tinder arranged in a way that allows for air circulation and makes it easier for the small flames to catch onto the kindling. Once the tinder starts burning, the flames gradually spread to the kindling, which consists of small, dry twigs and branches. This is how a campfire comes to life using this approach. II. The fire log is supposed to be a crucial part of the campfire, but your dad accidentally burned it, and he fears getting hurt by the fire. In this scenario, the tutorial addresses potential mishaps that can happen during the fire-building process. It demonstrates how to safely extinguish the accidental fire without causing harm to yourself or others, using water, sand, or a fire blanket. After the unwanted fire is put out, the lesson continues by discussing alternative materials for building a campfire in case you run out of conventional materials such as fire logs. Resourceful participants learn that they can make an effective campfire using large branches, dry leaves, and other natural materials. III. The tutorial shows the campfire burning on the ground. As the campfire ignites and the flames grow, the tutorial goes over important safety tips when managing an open fire. It discusses the ideal location for a campfire, which includes choosing a flat, open area away from flammable vegetation and structures. Safe distance from tents and camping equipment is also emphasized to avoid accidents. Additionally, the video highlights the importance of having a fire ring, which is made of rocks or metal, to contain the fire within a designated space. Lastly, proper methods to extinguish the fire completely, such as pouring water on the embers and stirring the ashes, are demonstrated to ensure that the campfire area is left safe and secure. IV. The tutorial showcases a green and red sweet recipe perfect for a campfire. After successfully starting and maintaining the campfire, the tutorial introduces a fun and easy recipe to make sweets, such as marshmallow-based treats, using the heat from the fire. Ingredients and steps to create the dish are explained clearly, ensuring that viewers understand how to prepare the treats from start to finish. Examples could include making s'mores, caramelized apples, or roasted marshmallows. Instructions on how to safely cook the treats over the campfire are given, including using skewers or campfire-safe cookware to avoid burns. Once the treats are ready, the tutorial wraps up by showing how to enjoy these delicious snacks by the warmth of the fire with friends and family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: AT&T, criticized and even despised for its inability to keep up with growing mobile data usage, thinks it has found the solution to its network woes. And all it will cost the telecom giant is 39 billion and months (or even years) of regulatory hurdles. In a stunning move, AT&T has acquired T-Mobile USA for a whopping 39 billion from Deutsche Telekom. Along with acquiring approximately 8% of AT&T, Deutsche Telekom will also be gaining a seat on AT&T's board of directors. The new combined entity, if it can garner regulatory approval, will be the largest carrier in the U.S. by leaps and bounds. AT&T and T-Mobile USA combined have over 25% more subscribers now than Verizon (125+ million vs. 93+ million). This acquisition isn't about subscriber bases, though; it's about improving AT&T's reliability and preparing it for the 4G era of wireless communication. The Spectrum Problem AT&T's press release tells a very clear story of why AT&T bought T-Mobile and why T-Mobile bought AT&T. It's no secret that AT&T has a tattered reputation. The iPhone may have brought it millions of new customers and billions in revenue, but the vast increase in data usage has also strained the network to unacceptable levels. There wouldn't have been so much hype surrounding the Verizon iPhone if AT&T's network didn't drop so many calls and upset so many customers. And while AT&T is investing billions to upgrade its network, it takes years to get the approval to build new towers, especially in metropolitan areas such as San Francisco. Without a dramatic move, AT&T's network wasn't going to get better anytime soon. Two sections of AT&T's press release are devoted specifically to this problem. It's a testament to just how crucial this problem is to AT&T's future. The first problem it addresses is spectrum: The wireless carrier simply doesn't have enough wireless spectrum to fuel the accelerating growth it has experienced over the last few years. \\"AT&T’s mobile data traffic grew 8,000 percent over the past four years and by 2015 it is expected to be eight to 10 times what it was in 2010,\\" AT&T explained in its announcement. \\"Put another way, all of the mobile traffic volume AT&T carried during 2010 is estimated to be carried in just the first six to seven weeks of 2015.\\" AT&T believes it will take years until more spectrum is opened up by the U.S. government for mobile broadband use. The simplest way to get its hands on precious broadband is through acquisition, and T-Mobile USA has the most GSM broadband spectrum after AT&T. The Infrastructure Problem The second problem is infrastructure. AT&T simply can't build towers fast enough, and the approval process to build the unsightly things acts as a major roadblock to the company's efforts to boost its network reliability. So if you can't build towers fast enough, what's the next best way to get them? That's right: You acquire them. \\"At closing, AT&T will immediately gain cell sites equivalent to what would have taken on average five years to build without the transaction, and double that in some markets,\\" AT&T notes in its press release. \\"The combination will increase AT&T’s network density by approximately 30 percent in some of its most populated areas, while avoiding the need to construct additional cell towers.\\" 39 billion is a lot of money to buy some towers, but because T-Mobile USA utilizes GSM technology (rather than the CDMA technology employed by Verizon), it can immediately use them to boost its network. If the deal is approved, expect AT&T to quickly offload some of its mobile data traffic on T-Mobile's infrastructure. AT&T may be talking a lot about 4G in its press release, but T-Mobile has no LTE technology or infrastructure to offer. No, today's acquisition is all about bolstering AT&T's network and beginning the process of repairing its reputation. To see how U.S. consumers feel about the acquisition and to share your opinions, too, click here to participate in our Mashable poll. ||||| What does AT&T's 39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile USA mean for Sprint? A whole lot of trouble. Sprint (S), the third-largest U.S. carrier, has struggled to find its niche for years. It spent billions of dollars building out a WiMAX 4G network that has failed to pay off. It's also battled customer losses (a.k.a. churn in industry lingo) and a reputation for less-than-stellar customer service. Assuming AT&T's (T) acquisition of T-Mobile makes it through anti-trust regulators, Sprint will be forced into an even further weakened position as the number three U.S. carrier, way behind AT&T/T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless (VZ). One of Sprint's biggest hurdles has been figuring out a 4G strategy. The Kansas-based carrier was actually the first U.S. operator to launch a 4G network, thanks to the expensive WiMAX buildout. But both Verizon Wireless and AT&T have already committed to LTE, a competing fourth-generation technology. With T-Mobile under AT&T's fold, LTE will have even greater reach to U.S. mobile users. \\"WiMAX was clearly not going to be the dominant technology going forward,\\" says Charles Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research. \\"This is going to make LTE technology more viable as an alternative for many customers trying to get broadband to their homes, some in markets that Sprint was aiming to address.\\" If (or more likely, when) LTE becomes ubiquitous, it will be even harder for Sprint to score big wins among enterprise customers as well as everyday consumers looking for broadband-like speeds on their mobile devices. That's because large, multinational companies want to arm mobile employees with technologies and products that work in the rest of the world. \\"Sprint doesn't have that with its current CDMA network and they don't have that with WiMAX,\\" says Forrester's Golvin. Like Sprint, Verizon phones also run on CDMA networks, but unlike Sprint, Verizon has already started building out LTE. If and when Sprint migrates to LTE is a question mark the company hasn't yet answered, but the T-Mobile acquisition will definitely put more pressure on the carrier to do so. AT&T's announcement on Sunday came as a surprise to many. Just days before, rumors circulated about a possible merger between Sprint and T-Mobile. \\"The U.S. wireless industry is one of the most fiercely competitive markets in the world and will remain so after this deal,\\" AT&T said in a press release on Sunday. \\"The U.S. is one of the few countries in the world where a large majority of consumers can choose from five or more wireless providers in their local market.\\" But AT&T's acquisition of T-Mobile means that AT&T and Verizon combined will own nearly three out of every four wireless subscriptions in the U.S. Sounds more like a duopoly than a \\"fiercely competitive market\\" to me. Sprint has improvements in customer retention, customer service and product lineup. It's also tried outdoing larger competitors on pricing.

Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electric energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations \\"AC\\" and \\"DC\\" are often used to mean simply \\"alternating\\" and \\"direct\\", as when they modify \\"current\\" or \\"voltage\\". - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - Trade, or commerce, involves the transfer of goods and/or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. A network that allows trade is called a market. - Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union. It is the second smallest German state by area. Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the wider Hamburg Metropolitan Region covers more than 5.1 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Elbe. - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light. - Stuttgart ( Swabian: \\"Schduagert\\"), often nicknamed the \\"\\"Schwabenmetropole\\"\\" in reference to its location in the center of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by some natives, is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley locally known as the \\"Stuttgarter Kessel\\" an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Stuttgart's name comes from the Old High German word \\"\\"Stuogarten\\",\\" or \\"stud farm\\" a reference to the city's founding in 950 AD as a stud farm. Stuttgarts urban area has a population of 623,738, and a further making it the sixth largest city in Germany, 2.7 million people live in the citys administrative region, and another 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Bremerhaven (literally \\"Bremen's harbour\\", Low German: \\"Bremerhoben\\") is a city at the seaport of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, a state of the Federal Republic of Germany. It forms an enclave in the state of Lower Saxony and is located at the mouth of the River Weser on its eastern bank, opposite the town of Nordenham. Though a relatively new city, it has a long history as a trade port and today is one of the most important German ports, playing a crucial role in Germany's trade. - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - A tower is a tall structure, taller than it is wide, often by a significant margin. Towers are distinguished from masts by their lack of guy-wires and are therefore, along with tall buildings, self-supporting structures. - Reinforced concrete (RC) is a composite material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility. The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars (rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure. Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not. Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed (in compression), so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads. In the United States, the most common methods of doing this are known as pre-tensioning and post-tensioning. For a strong, ductile and durable construction the reinforcement needs to have the following properties at least: - The City Municipality of Bremen is a Hanseatic city in northwestern Germany, which belongs to the state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen (also called just \\"Bremen\\" for short). - Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power. - The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period). There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's extreme values. In older texts the phase is sometimes called the amplitude. - Nordenham is a town in the Wesermarsch district, in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is located at the mouth (on the west bank) of the Weser river on the Butjadingen peninsula on the coast of the North Sea. The seaport city of Bremerhaven is located on the other side (east bank) of the river. The Midgard-seaport in Nordenham is the largest private-owned harbor in Germany. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - Steel is an alloy of iron and other elements, primarily carbon, that is widely used in construction and other applications because of its high tensile strength and low cost. Steel's base metal is iron, which is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one at the center of each of the six faces of the cube. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that otherwise occur in the crystal lattices of iron atoms. - Cologne is the largest city in the German federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia and the fourth-largest city in Germany (after Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich). It is located within the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, one of the major European metropolitan regions and the largest in Germany, with more than ten million inhabitants. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Lower Saxony is a German state (\\"Bundesland\\") situated in northwestern Germany and is second in area, with , and fourth in population (8 million) among the sixteen \\"Länder\\" of Germany. In rural areas Northern Low Saxon, a dialect of Low German, and Saterland Frisian, a variety of Frisian, are still spoken, but the number of speakers is declining. - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. - A polymer (Greek \\"poly-\\", \\"many\\" + \\"-mer\\", \\"parts\\") is a large molecule, or macromolecule, composed of many repeated subunits. Because of their broad range of properties, both synthetic and natural polymers play an essential and ubiquitous role in everyday life. Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function. Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many small molecules, known as monomers. Their consequently large molecular mass relative to small molecule compounds produces unique physical properties, including toughness, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form glasses and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals. - The Weser is a river in Northwestern Germany. Formed at Hannoversch Münden by the confluence of the rivers Fulda and Werra, it flows through Lower Saxony, then reaching the Hanseatic-town Bremen (see: Hanseatic League), before emptying further north at Bremerhaven into the North Sea. On the opposite (west) bank is the town of Nordenham at the foot of the Butjadingen Peninsula; thus, the mouth of the river is in Lower Saxony. The Weser has an overall length of . Together with its Werra tributary, which originates in Thuringia, its length is . - Concrete is a composite material composed of coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time. Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as ciment fondu. However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Bremerhaven Radar Tower is a 106 metre reinforced concrete tower located in Bremerhaven , Germany . The radar tower , which was constructed between 1962 and 1965 , accommodates numerous transmitting plants for maritime radio purposes , in addition to its radar equipment . A viewing platform is situated at the 60 metre level , and is accessible to the public . Unlike other transmitting towers , the Bremerhaven facility belongs to the Bremerhaven Water and Shipping department and not Deutsche Telekom AG or a broadcasting corporation . - Frankfurt am Main is a metropolis and the largest city in the German state of Hesse and the fifth-largest city in Germany, with a 2015 population of 731,095 within its administrative boundaries, and 2.3 million in its urban area. The city is at the centre of the larger Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 5.8 million and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after Rhine-Ruhr. Since the enlargement of the European Union in 2013, the geographic centre of the EU is about to the east of Frankfurt's CBD, the Bankenviertel. Frankfurt is culturally and ethnically diverse, with around half of the population, and a majority of young people, having a migration background. A quarter of the population are foreign nationals, including many expatriates. - Low German or Low Saxon ( or in the wider sense) is a West Germanic language spoken mainly in northern Germany and the eastern part of the Netherlands. It is descended from Old Saxon in its earliest form. - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names. - In materials science, ductility is a solid material's ability to deform under tensile stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to be stretched into a wire. Malleability, a similar property, is a material's ability to deform under compressive stress; this is often characterized by the material's ability to form a thin sheet by hammering or rolling. Both of these mechanical properties are aspects of plasticity, the extent to which a solid material can be plastically deformed without fracture. Also, these material properties are dependent on temperature and pressure (investigated by Percy Williams Bridgman as part of his Nobel Prize-winning work on high pressures). - Düsseldorf (Low Franconian, Ripuarian: \\"Düsseldörp\\" ) is the capital city of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the seventh most populous city in Germany. Düsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs. The city is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe Düsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. - Rebar (short for reinforcing bar), collectively known as reinforcing steel and reinforcement steel, is a steel bar or mesh of steel wires used as a tension device in reinforced concrete and reinforced masonry structures to strengthen and hold the concrete in tension. Rebar's surface is often patterned to form a better bond with the concrete. - Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer. - A cement is a binder, a substance used in construction that sets and hardens and can bind other materials together. The most important types of cement are used as a component in the production of mortar in masonry, and of concrete, which is a combination of cement and an aggregate to form a strong building material. - A building or edifice is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place, such as a house or factory. Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, to land prices, ground conditions, specific uses and aesthetic reasons. To better understand the term \\"building\\" compare the list of nonbuilding structures. - Munich (also in British English ) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Bavaria, on the banks of River Isar north of the Bavarian Alps. Munich is the third largest city in Germany, after Berlin and Hamburg, and the 12th biggest city of the European Union, with a population of above 1.5 million. The Munich Metropolitan Region is home to 5.8 million people. - In physics and electrical engineering, a conductor is an object or type of material that allows the flow of an electrical current in one or more directions. A metal wire is a common electrical conductor. Electrical current is generated by the flow of negatively charged electrons, positively charged holes, and positive or negative ions in some cases. - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on or to heat the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.

Ever since those first interactions we have become really close friends. Today Stuart turns 40 and I just wanted to share a few words about how remarkable a human being he is. Many of you who have listened to Stuart on Bad Voltage, seen him speak, worked with him, or socialized with him will know him for his larger than life personality. He is funny, warm, and passionate about his family, friends, and technology. He is opinionated, and many of you will know him for the amusing, insightful, and tremendously articulate way in which he expresses his views. He is remarkably talented and has an incredible level of insight and perspective. He is not just a brilliant programmer and software architect, but he has a deft knowledge and understanding of people, how they work together, and the driving forces behind human interaction. What I have always admired is that while bombastic in his views, he is always open to fresh ideas and new perspectives. For him life is a journey and new ways of looking at the road are truly thrilling for him. As I have grown as a person in my career, with my family, and particularly when moving to America, he has always supported yet challenged me. He is one of those rare friends that can enthusiastically validate great steps forward yet, with the same enthusiasm, illustrate mistakes too.

If I tell you that Frogs have permeable skin that easily absorbs substances from the environment, and ask you the question \\"what feature allows frogs to absorb substances from the environment?\\", is the correct answer \\"four limbs\\"? The answer is:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"four limbs.\\" The feature that allows frogs to absorb substances from the environment is their permeable skin. This characteristic is crucial for their respiration and overall survival in their habitats. Frogs have a unique skin structure compared to other animals, which contributes to their ability to absorb substances from the environment. This skin structure includes the following layers: 1. Stratum corneum: This is the outermost layer of a frog's skin, thin and keratinized. It is the first line of defense and helps protect the frog from physical injury and pathogens. However, it is more permeable than the stratum corneum in many other animals, allowing for the passage of substances into and out of the frog's body. 2. Stratum granulosum: This layer sits below the stratum corneum and is responsible for producing keratin, which provides structural support to the skin. The stratum granulosum is somewhat permeable, which contributes to the overall permeability of the skin. 3. Stratum spongiosum: This layer is made of connected and intertwined cells that form a spongy network, creating open spaces called lacunae. Blood vessels, nerves, and chromatophores (pigment-containing cells) can be found in this layer. The spongiosum's structure makes it highly permeable to water and substances dissolved in water. 4. Stratum compactum: The innermost layer, primarily composed of collagen fibers, provides structural support for the skin. In addition to these skin layers, frogs have mucus glands scattered throughout their skin. These glands secrete a slimy mucus that helps to keep the skin moist, which is essential for its permeability and the frog's ability to absorb and regulate water and other substances. This permeable skin presents both advantages and disadvantages for frogs. The advantages include the ability to \\"breathe\\" through their skin (cutaneous respiration), enabling them to absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide without using their lungs. This is particularly useful when they are submerged in water or when their environment has low oxygen levels. On the other hand, one major disadvantage of having permeable skin is that frogs are susceptible to absorbing harmful substances such as pollutants and toxins from the environment. These chemicals can lead to various health complications and possibly contribute to their decline in certain habitats. In conclusion, the feature allowing frogs to absorb substances from the environment is their permeable skin, with various specialized layers and mucus glands that facilitate this essential biological function."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nine families displaced by a fire at Alamo Hills Apartments in March filed lawsuits Wednesday against the apartment complex. They allege that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon in the aftermath of the blaze. Bernard Dempsey Jr., an attorney with Western Michigan Legal Services, the group that represents the tenants, said Alamo Hills gave the displaced families very limited opportunity to remove belongings. \\"They were given three days to get their stuff out, and if they couldn't get moved out in three days, their stuff was discarded,\\" Dempsey said. \\"Alamo Hills just threw it out.\\" Others, he said, lost possessions to looters after the March 23 blaze, which left 78 people temporarily homeless. According to the lawsuit, the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security. A spokesperson for PM One, the company that manages Alamo Hills, could not be reached for comment. Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court, which handles civil claims of less than 25,000. \\"We're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- 3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket expenses for their lost stuff,\\" Dempsey said. \\"They're not looking to get rich off this.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Tätä työtä on jatkettava. Which language is this?","completion":"The given text \\"Tätä työtä on jatkettava\\" is in Finnish, which is the official language of Finland and one of the official languages of the European Union. Finnish is part of the Finno-Ugric language family, a group of languages primarily spoken in the northern, central, and eastern regions of Europe and northwestern Russia. The phrase \\"Tätä työtä on jatkettava\\" can be translated to English as \\"This work must be continued\\" or \\"This work has to continue.\\" The individual words have the following meanings: - \\"Tätä\\" means \\"this\\" and is a demonstrative pronoun in the partitive case. - \\"työtä\\" means \\"work\\" and is the object of the sentence, also in the partitive case. - \\"on\\" is the third person singular form of \\"olla,\\" which is the Finnish verb for \\"to be.\\" - \\"jatkettava\\" is the passive form of the verb \\"jatkaa,\\" which means \\"to continue\\" or \\"to carry on.\\" Finnish grammar significantly differs from English grammar. It uses a complex system of cases – 15 in total – to mark grammatical, syntactic, and semantic roles of nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and numerals within a sentence. Unlike English, Finnish does not use articles (e.g., \\"the,\\" \\"a,\\" or \\"an\\"). Also, Finnish verbs exhibit a rich morphology, conjugating for person and number, mood, and tense. The word order in Finnish is relatively free compared to English, but the most common order is subject-verb-object (SVO), as seen in the example sentence given. If you are interested in learning more about the Finnish language, it's important to familiarize yourself with its unique grammar, vocabulary, and the way it forms both simple and compound words. Additionally, listening to native speakers conversing in Finnish and doing speaking exercises can help improve pronunciation and overall understanding of the language's nuances."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Crumple means change shape from smooth into compacted by physical force, and an apple apparently crumples.

Translate to French","completion":"Le Canada est, et continuera d'être, une nation commerçante avec des liens internationaux solides. Le Canada est un pays dont l'économie est largement axée sur le commerce international et les échanges avec les autres nations. Ce fait remonte même à plusieurs siècles, avec l'exploitation des premières routes commerciales par les explorateurs et la mise en place des infrastructures nécessaires pour faciliter ces échanges. Depuis lors, le Canada a développé des relations commerciales solides et bien ancrées avec un grand nombre de pays à travers le monde. Ces relations ont contribué à façonner l'économie canadienne et à lui donner le dynamisme et la diversité qui la caractérisent aujourd'hui. En particulier, le Canada a su tirer parti de ses ressources naturelles abondantes, de sa situation géographique stratégique et de sa main-d'œuvre hautement qualifiée pour nouer et maintenir des liens commerciaux étroits avec des partenaires clés. Au fil des ans, les exportations canadiennes ont continué à croître, en partie grâce à la signature d'accords commerciaux bilatéraux, régionaux et multilatéraux. Ces accords ont ouvert de nouvelles opportunités pour les entreprises canadiennes et ont contribué à renforcer l'intégration du Canada dans l'économie globale. Le Canada a également adopté des politiques commerciales progressistes, telles que la promotion du commerce durable et responsable et la protection des droits de l'homme, qui reflètent les valeurs et les priorités du pays en matière de commerce international. Aujourd'hui, le commerce international occupe une place prépondérante dans l'économie canadienne et joue un rôle essentiel dans sa croissance, sa prospérité et son bien-être. Les exportations de biens et de services représentent environ un tiers du produit intérieur brut (PIB) du Canada, tandis que les importations contribuent également à soutenir l'économie en offrant aux consommateurs et aux entreprises un accès à des produits et services de qualité, compétitifs et diversifiés. Il est clair que le Canada continuera à être un acteur majeur et engagé sur la scène commerciale internationale. Le pays continuera à travailler avec ses partenaires pour promouvoir et faciliter les échanges, réduire les barrières commerciales et maximiser les avantages économiques, sociaux et environnementaux du commerce international. Dans ce contexte, les relations commerciales solides du Canada avec les autres nations, ainsi que sa volonté d'approfondir et d'élargir ces liens, seront essentielles pour garantir le succès continu du pays en tant que nation commerçante et pour assurer sa prospérité et sa compétitivité sur la scène mondiale."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph: Life for the partners of Cates, Katalinic & Lund holds little of the glamour one might expect from a career in law. Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas. (St. Mary's later dropped out.) Since then, it has drawn seven additional law schools to its ranks: the University of Michigan, Rutgers and Syracuse Law Schools, New York Law School, University of New Mexico School of Law, Thomas M. Cooley Law School and Touro Law School. It has elicited at least initial interest from 19 more.
