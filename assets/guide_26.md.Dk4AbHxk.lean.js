To find the complement of S, we need to find all the elements in U that are not in S. We can do this by comparing the elements of U and S: 1. The number 1 is not in S, so it is in the complement of S. 2. The number 2 is in S, so it is not in the complement of S. 3. The number 3 is not in S, so it is in the complement of S. 4. The number 4 is in S, so it is not in the complement of S. 5. The number 5 is not in S, so it is in the complement of S. 6. The number 6 is in S, so it is not in the complement of S. 7. The number 7 is not in S, so it is in the complement of S. 8. The number 8 is in S, so it is not in the complement of S. 9. The number 9 is not in S, so it is in the complement of S. 10. The number 10 is in S, so it is not in the complement of S. Thus, the complement of S, denoted by S', is the set of all odd numbers from 1 to 9, i.e., S' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. To prove that the complement of S is unique, we need to show that there is no other set that can be the complement of S. Let's assume there is another set T that is also the complement of S. Since T is the complement of S, it must contain all the elements in U that are not in S, which are the odd numbers from 1 to 9. Therefore, T = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. But this is exactly the same as the set S', which means that T and S' are the same set. This contradicts our assumption that there is another set T that is different from S'. Therefore, the complement of S is unique, and it is the set S' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}."},{"prompt":"Let U={1,2,3,4,5,6} be the universal set, and suppose that A and B are two sets such that A^c=B^c.

Since C and D are both complements of B in A, we know that: 1. A = B ∪ C 2. A = B ∪ D Now, let's consider the intersection of C and D: C ∩ D = (B ∪ C) ∩ (B ∪ D) = A ∩ (B ∪ D) = A ∩ A = A Since C and D are both subsets of A, their intersection must also be a subset of A. However, we just showed that their intersection is equal to A, which means that C and D must contain all the elements of A that are not in B. Since there are only 8 elements in A that are not in B, and both C and D contain all of these elements, it must be the case that C = D. This contradicts our initial assumption that C ≠ D.

To find the number of elements in the power set of A, we can consider each element of A as having two possibilities: either it is in a particular subset or it is not. Therefore, for each of the n elements in A, there are 2 choices. The total number of possible subsets (i.e., the number of elements in the power set) is the product of these choices, which is 2^n. Now, we need to prove that the cardinality of the power set of A is always greater than n. We know that the cardinality of the power set of A is 2^n. We want to show that 2^n > n for all positive integers n. We can prove this by induction. Base case: n = 1 2^1 = 2 > 1, so the statement holds for n = 1. Inductive step: Assume that the statement holds for n = k, i.e., 2^k > k. We want to show that the statement also holds for n = k + 1, i.e., 2^(k+1) > k + 1. 2^(k+1) = 2 * 2^k > 2 * k (since 2^k > k by the inductive hypothesis) Now, we need to show that 2 * k > k + 1. This is equivalent to showing that k > 1, which is true for all positive integers k ≥ 2. Thus, by induction, we have shown that the cardinality of the power set of A is always greater than n for all positive integers n."},{"prompt":"Let A = {1, 2, 3}.

We want to show that A x (B ∪ C) = (A x B) ∪ (A x C) for any sets A, B, and C. Proof: Let (a, d) be an arbitrary element in A x (B ∪ C). Then, by definition of Cartesian product, a ∈ A and d ∈ (B ∪ C). Since d ∈ (B ∪ C), either d ∈ B or d ∈ C. Case 1: d ∈ B Then, (a, d) ∈ A x B. Therefore, (a, d) ∈ (A x B) ∪ (A x C). Case 2: d ∈ C Then, (a, d) ∈ A x C. Therefore, (a, d) ∈ (A x B) ∪ (A x C). In both cases, (a, d) ∈ (A x B) ∪ (A x C). So, A x (B ∪ C) ⊆ (A x B) ∪ (A x C). Now, let (a, d) be an arbitrary element in (A x B) ∪ (A x C). Then, either (a, d) ∈ A x B or (a, d) ∈ A x C. Case 1: (a, d) ∈ A x B Then, a ∈ A and d ∈ B. Therefore, d ∈ (B ∪ C) and (a, d) ∈ A x (B ∪ C). Case 2: (a, d) ∈ A x C Then, a ∈ A and d ∈ C. Therefore, d ∈ (B ∪ C) and (a, d) ∈ A x (B ∪ C). In both cases, (a, d) ∈ A x (B ∪ C). So, (A x B) ∪ (A x C) ⊆ A x (B ∪ C). Since A x (B ∪ C) ⊆ (A x B) ∪ (A x C) and (A x B) ∪ (A x C) ⊆ A x (B ∪ C), we can conclude that A x (B ∪ C) = (A x B) ∪ (A x C).

If (x, y) is in A×C, then x is in A and y is in C. In either case, x is in A and y is in B∪C, so (x, y) is in A×(B∪C). Therefore, (A×B)∪(A×C) ⊆ A×(B∪C).

(A x B) ∪ {(1,3)}: Since A x B = {(1,3), (2,3)}, the union of A x B and {(1,3)} is the set of all elements that are in A x B or in {(1,3)}.
