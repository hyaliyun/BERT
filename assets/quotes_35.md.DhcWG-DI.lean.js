Article:","completion":"Title: How to Draw a Simple Graph with a + Shape Hey there, little friends! Today, we are going to learn how to draw a simple graph using a plus (+) shape. Are you excited? Let's get started! First, let's talk about the function. The function is like a special rule that tells us how to use numbers to make a picture. We will use this rule to make our graph. Now, let's see how we can draw our graph: 1. You know how to draw a big plus (+) sign, right? We will do that on a piece of paper. The place where the two crossed lines meet is called the \\"origin\\". It's like a secret meeting point of the lines. 2. It's time to number our graph! You know how to count, so this should be easy for you. Starting at the origin, count 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. to the right along the horizontal line (that's the line that goes from left to right). Do the same going to the left. Now, also count along the vertical line (that's the line that goes up and down) by counting 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. going up and doing the same going down. These numbers will help us find where to put our dots for the graph. 3. Next, we are going to use our special function rule to find the \\"y value\\" for 2 or 3 \\"x values\\". The x values are like the numbers we counted on the horizontal line and the y values are like the numbers we counted on the vertical line. Our function will tell us which y-number a dot will be at when we choose an x-number. 4. Now that we have our number pairs from our function, we are going to draw the graph points! Let's say our pair is (2, 3). This means we go to the number 2 on the horizontal line and then we go up to the number 3 on the vertical line and draw a little dot. Yay! We found our first graph point. Do that with each pair you’ve got from the function. 5. In the end, it's time to remove the imaginary lines. This means the lines on your graph paper that don't need to be part of your graph - we erase them or cover them up so that we just see our + shape and graph points. And that's it!

Process: - Sediment settles in a place due to gravity - The sediment breaks down into small particles - Wind or water picks up the sediment - The sediment travels along the same route as the wind or water - The sediment is deposited at new locations by the wind or water - The sediment is picked up again by new wind or water - The sediment travels further - The sediment is deposited again in a new place. Question: suppose the sediment is picked up by the ocean tide happens, how will it affect the wind or water will carry the sediment. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"When sediment is picked up by the ocean tide, its transportation, deposition, and potential impact on the wind or water carrying it can be influenced by several factors. These factors can contribute to a more, less, or no significant effect on subsequent processes. 1. More effect: Suppose that the ocean tide carries the sediment towards a coastal area with stronger wind currents. In this case, the sediment's deposition onshore can enhance the wind's capacity to pick up and transport the sediment further. The sediment particles can potentially influence wind patterns or interact with the local atmosphere, changing the wind dynamics or causing localized turbulence. This results in an amplification of the transportation and potential deposition at newer or further locations, contributing to a more significant effect on the overall sediment movement process. 2. Less effect: If the ocean tide picks up sediment and transports it into deeper waters or a stagnant location without any additional wind or water factors coming into play, the sediment's movement may be limited. As a result, the sediment might settle or become trapped, and the impact on subsequent wind or water currents transporting the sediment will be less significant. 3. No effect: In some cases, the ocean tide might carry and deposit sediment in an area where the conditions for wind or water currents remain unchanged. In this scenario, the perturbation of the ocean tide may not have any substantial effect on subsequent wind or water currents carrying the sediment. The sediment might be deposited and later picked up again without any significant change in the movement, transportation, and deposition process. In summary, the effect of sediment being picked up by the ocean tide on subsequent wind or water currents carrying the sediment can vary depending on the location, environmental conditions, and other factors that may come into play. The influence might be more, less, or have no significant effect, ultimately shaping the overall sediment movement process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If the makers of Atlantis had something to say in this film, its theme was (literally) drowned out by the emphasis on \\"special effects\\" over characterization. Almost as if in an attempt to \\"keep up\\" with the rest of the summer action blockbusters, Disney has ditched the character-driven, movie-with-a-message approach in favor of a Star Wars \\"shoot-'em-up\\" with stereotype heroes and villains. The art is cartoony and the producers think that they can rely on computer generated images (CGI) of flying fish-craft and submarines to fill the gap. They are wrong, and the days of beautiful, handcrafted animation is fast flying out the window in favor of assembly-line CGI. This movie is all spectacle with no heart. At times the film comes close to being a good, worthwhile movie, but frustratingly misses the mark so many times by copping out of talking about something meaningful and instead choosing to go with the glitz. Another problem with the movie is the pacing. It starts confusingly and then begins to rocket along with a choppy story editing style that is not appreciated. The viewer is rushed out of the door along with Milo Thatch (voiced well by Michael J. Fox) and is left thinking \\"Gee there must be an awful lot of stuff that's going to happen once we get to Atlantis\\". Unfortunately, not much happens. The secret of Atlantis remains a secret with the story-tellers not really knowing how to explain the legendary island/continent. They are afraid to commit to saying where Atlantis is, even in a fictional story. Is it in the Atlantic? Is it in the Mediterranean Sea? Who knows? Nothing is hypothesized, even from a purely fantasy-based point of view. The viewer will leave the theatre asking themselves \\"Now what was that all about? What was the point of the movie? Why couldn't the surviving Atlantean's remember how to read when many of them lived through the disaster to the \\"present\\" day? And WHY did Atlantis sink?\\" and then promptly begin to forget about what they saw. There is nothing left to think about or mill over... except the loss of money in their wallets. The characters and their motivations are equally unfathomable. From the eccentric zillionaire who founds the expedition with seemingly more money that existed on the entire planet in 1914, to the (spoiler) collective consciousness that enters Kida and VOLUNTARILY deserts its people!?! The crew are a collection of quirky, 2-dimensional people of anachronistically (for 1914) P.C. race and gender. The demolitions expert talks like he came right out of a Warner Brothers' Bugs Bunny short. Most of the jokes are gross one-liners that are largely missed by the audience for two reasons: They are delivered at lightning-speed pacing and usually mumbled. The way these supporting players do a moral turn-around near the end of the movie is hard to believe. While we applaud Disney for trying to create animated movies for adults - and this is the first Disney not to have cute, talking animals or objects - it fails to make the transition. Younger children will be frightened by some of the action scenes and be left in the dark by the large amount of subtitles (when the characters speak Atlantean). In the first five minutes of the expedition, approximately 200 people are killed without a second thought. Obviously Disney thinks that if you didn't know who those people were, then why should you care? Again, the movie has no feelings on any level. Mulan and Tarzan were the last animated movies produced by Disney that were done extremely well. Sadly, Atlantis harkens back to those failed attempts in the past such as the Black Cauldron and Hunchback of Notre Dame. Disney needs to get back to their roots. A sequel to Peter Pan is coming out shortly but one never knows what the results will be until you see it for yourself. And now that Disney has discovered Science Fiction one hopes that they will realize that that genre must have more than spectacle to it. We also hope that the upcoming \\"Treasure Planet\\", a sci-fi adaptation of Robert L. Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island\\", will have more heart to it than the unfathomable \\"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\\". Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"This review is predominantly negative. It criticizes the film's emphasis on special effects and lack of characterization, as well as the confusing plot and pacing. Additionally, the review points out a lack of depth and emotional connection in the characters and story. It expresses dissatisfaction with Disney's transition to animation for adults in this instance and hopes for better results in future projects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Process: - As the sweat evaporates the sweat sheds molecules into the air - The sweat changes into a gas - Heat is drawn from the sweat - This process draws heat from the body - The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person does a heavy workout happens, how will it affect MORE body cooling occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect, both direct and indirect, on the process of body cooling. When a person engages in heavy physical activity or workout, their body heat increases due to the metabolic processes taking place during muscle and energy consumption. In response to this elevated body temperature, the body produces sweat to cool itself down. The perturbation of increased sweating leads to more body cooling through the following mechanisms: 1. Direct effect: The increased sweating results in a greater amount of sweat on the skin, which means more sweat can evaporate. When the sweat evaporates, it changes into a gas and sheds molecules into the air, thus allowing more heat to be drawn from the body. Consequently, the body is cooled more as greater amounts of heat are dissipated into the environment. 2. Indirect effect: The increased production of sweat also promotes vasodilation of blood vessels in the skin. As blood vessels dilate, they increase blood flow to the skin, bringing more heat to the surface. This additional heat is further dissipated by the sweat, enhancing the overall cooling effect. In conclusion, the perturbation of a heavy workout leading to increased sweating has a direct effect on body cooling through evaporation and an indirect effect by promoting vasodilation and heat dissipation through the skin. This combination of mechanisms helps regulate body temperature and prevent overheating during physical activity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question. The Copenhagen Criteria define eligibility for national membership of what organisation?","completion":"The Copenhagen Criteria define the eligibility for national membership of the European Union (EU). The Copenhagen Criteria, sometimes also referred to as the 'Copenhagen Criteria for EU Membership', were established during the European Council meeting that took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, back in 1993. These criteria set out the specific conditions that a candidate country must meet in order to be considered for accession to the European Union. The Copenhagen Criteria are divided into three primary categories: 1. Political Criteria: This entails having stable institutions that guarantee democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights, and protection of minorities. The candidate country should demonstrate that it has a well-functioning democratic system in place, including an independent judiciary, respect for fundamental rights, and effective mechanisms to combat corruption and criminal activity. 2. Economic Criteria: This involves having a functioning market economy, as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the European Union. The candidate country must be able to show that it has a sound economic foundation, with liberalised markets that promote fair competition. The country should also display a commitment to tackling macroeconomic imbalances and have the ability to integrate successfully into the EU's single market. 3. Legal and Institutional Criteria (Acquis Communautaire): This requires adopting, implementing, and enforcing all the existing EU laws and regulations, known as the Acquis Communautaire. The candidate country must showcase its ability to align its national legal and institutional frameworks with those of the EU, which encompasses a wide range of sectors such as agriculture, environment, social policy, and justice and home affairs. Additionally, the country must also demonstrate an aptitude for participating in the EU's various institutions and policies effectively. Apart from these principal criteria, the European Union assesses a candidate country's ability to maintain stable and friendly relations with its neighbors, as well as its commitment to peaceful conflict resolution. The Copenhagen Criteria serve as a crucial mechanism in determining whether a country is ready for EU membership, ensuring that it can contribute positively to the Union's project of integration and uphold the shared values and principles. Since the establishment of these criteria, several countries have successfully joined the EU, with each candidate undergoing a rigorous assessment of their adherence to the Copenhagen Criteria."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The boy, with his eyes ablaze in determination, furiously swings the wooden stick at the person-shaped pinata, each strike more powerful than the last. He refuses to let the pinata's vibrant exterior from splaying open to reveal its hidden treasure. With each swing, the rope suspends the pinata in a wild, unpredictable dance, as if teasing the boy - daring him to try again. His friends and family, gathered around the scene, cheer him on with excited laughter and shouts of encouragement. The little boy's arms soon grow weary with each powerful strike, but his determination doesn't falter. He knows that eventually, one of his mighty swings will achieve the desired effect, spilling sweet treats for all those eagerly waiting. He can't help but wonder if he'll be the one to unwrap the first prize, his eyes scanning the colors of the pinata as if to read its secret thoughts. But that doesn't matter now; his only focus is on breaking that pinata wide open. As the crowd cheers grow louder and more encouraging, the sun glistening brightly against the green grass, the little boy takes a deep breath and repositions his feet. Bracing his arm for another powerful swing, he assails the pinata once more, finally loosening the strong fibers of the rope that had held it captive. As the pinata swings lower and lower, the boy feels hope and satisfaction starting to rise within him, like a warm wave reaching the shore. The heartfelt support of his friends and family, the thrill of competition, and the allure of sweet victory only serve to heighten his resolve. Despite the exhaustion tugging at his muscles and the sweat running down his forehead, the boy's face is framed by a fiery determination, his eyes never leaving the lively dance of the pinata before him. Each miss only serves to fuel his fervor, as he imagines the ultimate success already within reach. The sheer resilience of this little boy— refusing to yield until he accomplishes his quest—is the heartwarming foundation of this cherished memory. For the little boy, the experience is about more than just getting his hands on the sweet rewards hidden inside the pinata. It is about persevering, giving his all, and harnessing the energy of the crowd that has gathered to witness this enchanting symbol of celebration. No matter the outcome, he will walk away with his head held high, knowing that he engaged in this playful rite of passage with everything he had. Meanwhile, the pinata, that tantalizing challenge he so bravely faced, continues to bob precariously as the boy swings one final strike, winding down his triumphant battle against an adversary that, despite the bruises and dents, captured the very essence of joy and excitement."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie plot title: Jamaica Inn Movie plot: Jamaica Inn is the headquarters of a gang of wreckers led by the innkeeper Joss Merlyn (Leslie Banks). The wreckers are responsible for a series of engineered shipwrecks in which they extinguish coastal warning beacons to cause ships to run aground on the rocky Cornish coast. Then they kill the surviving sailors and steal the cargo from the wrecks. Beautiful, young Mary Yellan (Maureen O'Hara) is travelling to Jamaica Inn in a carriage, but the driver is afraid to stop there and drives a long way past the inn in spite of her repeated demands that he stop. Instead, he drops her off near the home of the local squire and justice of the peace, Sir Humphrey Pengallan (Charles Laughton). She meets him and requests the loan of a horse so she can go back to Jamaica Inn. Pengallan warns her not to go there. Nevertheless, Mary says she just came from Ireland, and as the orphaned niece of Joss's wife Patience (Marie Ney), she intends to live at Jamaica Inn. Unable to convince her to stay, Pengallan accompanies Mary to Jamaica Inn. When Joss meets Mary, he tries to kiss her and push himself on her. Patience is distraught to learn her sister, Mary's mother, has died. When Mary tells Joss that Pengallan has accompanied her to Jamaica Inn, Joss goes upstairs and reports to Pengallan.

Sentence 1: On the first morning, you take a jeep-safari at dawn to scout the terrain. Sentence 2: The last day will consist of scouting the terrain by jeep-safari. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Step 1: Analyze both sentences to understand their meaning. Sentence 1 describes an action done \\"on the first morning,\\" where \\"you take a jeep-safari at dawn\\" for the purpose of \\"scout[ing] the terrain.\\" Sentence 2 states \\"the last day\\" and what will happen, which is \\"scouting the terrain by jeep-safari.\\" Step 2: Compare the sentences to check if the second sentence follows logically from the first. The first sentence talks about the first morning and mentions an activity - taking a jeep-safari at dawn to scout the terrain. The second sentence, on the other hand, describes an event that takes place on the last day, with a similar activity - scouting the terrain by jeep-safari. It is clear that both sentences discuss scouting the terrain via a jeep-safari. However, the timing and context differ, as one refers to the first morning, and the other to the last day. Step 3: Determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Given the information in the two sentences, it is not possible to determine if the second sentence is necessarily a consequence of the first sentence. The events mentioned in both sentences occur at different times, and there is no suggestion that one event will lead to the other. It is also important to note that the second sentence does not contain context about whether this event is a repeat of the first day's activity or something that is planned independently. Conclusion: The second sentence (Sentence 2) is not entailed by the first sentence (Sentence 1)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Claim: Macs don't get viruses as often and thus run more smoothly What evidence supports this claim?","completion":"The claim that Macs don't get viruses as often and thus run more smoothly has some evidence to support it. While no computer system is completely immune to malware, Macs have traditionally experienced fewer security issues when compared to Windows-based systems. Various factors contribute to this situation, including: 1. Market share: One of the main reasons for the lower incidence of virus attacks on Macs is their market share. Windows has a much larger market share compared to Mac, with approximately 76% of the market worldwide, whereas macOS (the operating system that powers Apple's Mac computers) accounts for around 17%. Since there are more Windows users, it is a more attractive target for hackers and individuals who create malware to exploit vulnerabilities in the system. Thus, malware developers often focus on creating viruses for Windows rather than macOS. 2. Unix-based architecture: MacOS is based on a Unix-based architecture, which is considered to be more secure when compared to Windows. Unix was designed with security in mind and includes built-in protective features that make it more challenging for malware and hackers to exploit vulnerabilities. For instance, macOS restricts access to its core system files and requires administrator privileges for significant system changes. These permissions act as additional barriers that a potential hacker or malware needs to overcome to be successful in its attack. 3. Apple's app ecosystem: One of the key factors that plays a role in macOS's robust security is Apple's App Store and its walled garden model. Apple rigorously reviews and screens all applications that are submitted to the App Store to ensure they meet specific quality and security criteria. This process significantly reduces the likelihood of malicious software entering the macOS ecosystem. In contrast, Windows users can easily download and install software from various sources, which increases the chances of downloading a malicious application unknowingly. 4. XProtect: Apple has incorporated a built-in malware protection feature called XProtect within macOS. XProtect operates in the background and scans all downloaded files for any known malicious code or threats. This feature provides an added layer of security and is updated frequently by Apple to ensure it can recognize and protect against the latest threats. 5. Security patches and updates: Apple regularly releases updates for macOS that include security patches to fix any known vulnerabilities. While Windows also releases security updates, the fragmented nature of the Windows ecosystem - with various manufacturers, hardware configurations, and older operating system versions still in use - can sometimes lead to delays in these updates becoming available or being installed by users. While the abovementioned factors contribute to the perception that Macs are less prone to viruses and run more smoothly, it is important to remember that no system is entirely immune. As Macs gain more users and become more popular, they may attract increased attention from hackers and malware developers, and thus, it is crucial for users to remain vigilant, maintain good security practices, and perform regular system updates."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a news article: January Genomic Health announces initiation of a clinical validation study of their prostate cancer test; & the acceleration of the company's Next Generation Sequencing program. The prostate cancer test validation study, being performed in collaboration with leading prostate cancer researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), is designed to determine if a multi-gene test can help distinguish aggressive disease requiring surgery from less aggressive disease that may undergo active surveillance in patients with early-stage prostate cancer. Complete results are expected to be presented at the end of this year or early next year, and if positive, are expected to support the launch of the Oncotype DX ® prostate cancer test in 2013. prostate cancer test in 2013. The company also announced that it is accelerating its Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) program by moving it into clinical development studies that will examine both RNA-Seq expression and mutation analysis. This decision comes after the company successfully conducted the first clinical outcomes study for biomarker discovery using NGS for whole transcriptome profiling of archival FFPE tumor specimens. Results of this study were presented at the 2011 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December. In addition, informatics infrastructure investments to support a cloud-based system for storage and analysis of large genomic data sets are underway. The NGS technology allows Genomic Health scientists to assay the entire genome simultaneously to discover regions of the genome whose expression is associated with clinical outcomes and treatment response.

Press Release September Genomic Health announces positive results from a large clinical validation study of its biopsy-based prostate cancer test. The study, performed in collaboration with leading prostate cancer researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), met its primary endpoint by demonstrating that the multi-gene Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score (GPS), assessed in prostate needle biopsy tumor tissue, has been prospectively validated as a predictor of adverse pathology for patients with early-stage prostate cancer. UCSF and Genomic Health plan to submit complete data from this study for presentation at the 2013 ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in February. Based on these results, Genomic Health is completing the necessary work in its Clinical Reference Laboratory to make the Oncotype DX prostate cancer test available to physicians and patients in the first half of 2013. Press Release ||||| Here we report the results of a prospectively conducted clinical trial, the Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment (TAILORx). This trial was designed to further validate and refine the clinical usefulness of the 21-gene assay (Oncotype DX Recurrence Score, Genomic Health) in a specified low-risk cohort of women with hormone-receptor–positive, HER2-negative, axillary node–negative invasive breast cancer. Previous studies have shown that a 21-gene expression assay provides additional prognostic information independent of clinicopathologic features 15 and also predicts benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in estrogen-receptor–positive disease. 16,17 Prospective validation was performed with the use of archival tumor specimens from completed studies that used a prospective–retrospective design. 18 However, validation in prospectively conducted studies provides the highest level of evidence supporting the clinical validity and ultimately the clinical usefulness of a new biomarker. 19,20 More than 100,000 women in the United States received a diagnosis of estrogen-receptor–positive breast cancer associated with negative axillary lymph nodes in 2014. 11 Although approximately 85% of these women may be recurrence-free at 10 years with adjuvant endocrine therapy alone, the addition of chemotherapy leads to a relative reduction in the risk of recurrence of approximately 30% on average, which translates into an absolute benefit in the rate of freedom from recurrence of up to 5 percentage points. 12,13 Many patients with estrogen-receptor–positive breast cancer would therefore be overtreated with chemotherapy on the basis of clinicopathologic features alone, since most would have been adequately treated with endocrine therapy alone. 14 For contemporary taxane-based or anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens, proportional reductions in risk have been shown to be affected only minimally by age, nodal status, tumor grade, estrogen-receptor expression, or use of adjuvant endocrine therapy. 8 These findings led a National Institutes of Health consensus panel in 2001 to conclude that “adjuvant polychemotherapy…should be recommended to the majority of women with localized breast cancer regardless of lymph node, menopausal, or hormone receptor status.” 9 The widespread use of adjuvant chemotherapy has contributed to the declining breast-cancer mortality that has been observed in the United States and other industrialized nations. 10 Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide and in the United States, and it is the leading cause of death from cancer in women worldwide. 1 Prognostic factors for the recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site regardless of treatment include clinicopathologic features such as tumor size and grade and the number of axillary lymph nodes with metastasis. 2 Predictive factors that identify a benefit from specific therapies include the expression of the estrogen receptor and the progesterone receptor, which identifies patients who benefit from adjuvant endocrine therapy, 3 and overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein (or HER2 gene amplification), 4 which identifies patients who benefit from adjuvant HER2-directed therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy reduces the risk of recurrence, even among patients with axillary node–negative disease who are at lower risk for recurrence. 5-7 Event-free rates were estimated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method, with confidence intervals computed with the use of the log–log transformation and Greenwood’s variance. The data-cutoff date for the results presented here was July 29, 2015. Statistical comparisons of baseline characteristics were calculated with the use of the chi-square test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon test and Student’s t-test for continuous variables. Tumor size in the greatest dimension, histologic grade of the tumor, and expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 were determined locally and reported by the participating site. The overall sample size in all the risk strata defined according to recurrence score was driven by the need to include a sufficient number of patients with a score of 11 to 25 (midrange risk) in order to test the noninferiority of endocrine therapy alone versus chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy. At the fourth planned interim analysis held on March 20, 2015, the ECOG–ACRIN data and safety monitoring committee recommended that the results of the low-risk group be released and that follow-up in the randomized midrange-risk stratum and the nonrandomized high-risk stratum continue as planned. Although there was no specific enrollment goal for the low-risk group, the large sample provided the opportunity to estimate 5-year event rates accurately. Secondary end points included time-to-event analyses of the freedom from the recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site, with an event of breast cancer at a distant site defined as the first event of distant recurrence of breast cancer or death with distant recurrence, if death was the first manifestation of distant recurrence (which corresponds to the STEEP definition of distant recurrence–free interval); freedom from any recurrence, with recurrence defined as the first recurrence of breast cancer at any site (including ipsilateral breast cancer, local or regional recurrence, or distant recurrence) or death with recurrence, if death was the first manifestation of recurrence (which corresponds to the STEEP definition of recurrence-free interval); and the overall survival rate, which was defined as the proportion of patients who did not die (from any cause). End-point assessments that were consistent with standard of care at regular intervals were specified in the protocol , and copies of source documents supporting each event were reviewed and corroborated by one of the coauthors who did not have knowledge of the study group or the recurrence-score information. The standardized definitions for efficacy end points (STEEP) criteria were used for the end-point definitions. 23 The primary trial end point was a time-to-event analysis of the rate of survival free from invasive cancer, with an invasive-cancer event defined as the first event of recurrence of ipsilateral breast tumor, local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant recurrence, contralateral second primary invasive cancer, second primary nonbreast invasive cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer), or death without evidence of recurrence (which corresponds to the STEEP definition of invasive disease–free survival). The manuscript was written by the first author; the final version of the manuscript incorporated some changes recommended by the coauthors and Genomic Health. Data were collected by the Cancer Trials Support Unit and the ECOG–ACRIN Cancer Research Group Coordinating Center. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses presented and for the adherence of the study to the protocol , which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. No commercial support was involved in the planning or execution of the study, although the genomic test used is commercially available. To minimize the potential for undertreatment of the participants enrolled in our trial, the recurrence-score ranges used in our study differed from those that were originally defined as low (≤10 in our study vs. <18 in the original definition), intermediate (11 to 25 vs. 18 to 30), and high (≥26 vs. ≥31). 14 The recurrence-score strata derived for the trial were based on prior studies that indicated that the risk of recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site at 10 years after diagnosis and a 5-year course of tamoxifen could be as high as 10% among patients with a score of 11 (point estimate, 7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5 to 10) and up to 20% among those with a score of 25 (point estimate, 16%; 95% CI, 13 to 20), 15 indicating a risk that was substantial enough for a recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with a score of 11 or higher. 14 All the patients had an Oncotype DX Recurrence Score, a reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction 21-gene assay performed on RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, performed in a central laboratory (Genomic Health). 15 The recurrence scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of recurrence. Patients with a score of 0 to 10 were assigned to receive endocrine therapy alone, and those with a score of 26 or higher were assigned to receive chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy. Prior studies indicated that patients with a score of less than 11 had a favorable prognosis with endocrine therapy alone 15 and also that patients with a score of 26 to 30 or higher derived substantially greater benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. 16,17 Patients with a midrange score of 11 to 25 were randomly assigned to receive either chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy or endocrine therapy alone because the benefits of chemotherapy were uncertain in this group, yet the risk of recurrence was high enough to suggest that chemotherapy might be beneficial. This prospective clinical trial was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), was coordinated by the ECOG and subsequently the ECOG–ACRIN Cancer Research Group, and included other participating NCI-sponsored groups. Patients were required to provide written informed consent, including willingness to have treatment assigned or randomly assigned on the basis of the genetic-assay results indicating the risk of recurrence. Other eligibility criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 0 or 1 (on a scale from 0 to 5, with higher numbers indicating greater disability; a score of 0 indicates no symptoms, and a score of 1 mild symptoms) and normal hematologic, bone marrow, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, and cardiac function. Patients with HER2-overexpressing disease were excluded because most have a high risk of recurrence 14 and because such patients benefit from adjuvant HER2-directed therapy plus chemotherapy. 22 The study included women 18 to 75 years of age with axillary node–negative invasive breast cancer that was estrogen-receptor–positive or progesterone-receptor–positive (or both) and that did not overexpress HER2. Patients had to meet National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy, 21 including a primary tumor size of 1.1 to 5.0 cm in the greatest dimension for a tumor of any grade or a size of 0.6 to 1.0 cm in the greatest dimension for a tumor of intermediate or high histologic grade or nuclear grade (or both). In a multivariate analysis that included age (≤50 years vs. 51 to 60 years vs. 61 to 75 years), tumor size (2.1 to 5.0 cm vs. ≤2 cm in the greatest dimension), histologic grade (high vs. intermediate vs. low), and surgery type (mastectomy vs. lumpectomy), only histologic grade showed a significant association with the rate of freedom from recurrence. However, histologic grade did not show a significant association with the rate of invasive disease–free survival or the rate of freedom from distant recurrence ( Table 2 Table 2 Multivariate Analysis.). Recurrence rates were very low regardless of histologic grade ( Table 3 Table 3 Event Rates at 5 Years, According to Histologic Grade.). In this cohort, the rate of invasive disease–free survival at 5 years was 93.8% (95% CI, 92.4 to 94.9). The rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site at 5 years was 99.3% (95% CI, 98.7 to 99.6), the rate of freedom from recurrence at 5 years was 98.7% (95% CI, 97.9 to 99.2), and the rate of overall survival at 5 years was 98.0% (95% CI, 97.1 to 98.6). In the cohort of patients with a recurrence score of 0 to 10, there were 88 events of either invasive cancer or death and 30 deaths reported within 5 years after study entry. The first event in the analysis of survival free from invasive disease was local or regional recurrence (or both) in 8 patients, distant recurrence in 10, invasive cancer of the opposite breast in 15, other invasive new primary cancer in 43, and death without another event in 12. The Kaplan–Meier estimates for each end point examined are shown in Figure 1 Figure 1 Kaplan–Meier Estimates in the Analyses of Invasive Disease–free Survival, Freedom from Recurrence of Breast Cancer at a Distant Site, Freedom from Recurrence at Any Site, and Overall Survival.. In the low-risk cohort of 1626 patients, endocrine therapy included an aromatase inhibitor in 963 patients (59%), tamoxifen in 560 (34%), sequential tamoxifen followed by aromatase-inhibitor therapy in 13 (1%), ovarian-function suppression in 44 (3%), or other or unknown therapy in 46 (3%). Although the protocol specified that no chemotherapy be given if the recurrence score was 0 to 10, a total of 6 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy (1 of whom had a recurrence despite adjuvant chemotherapy). Table 1 Table 1 Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline, According to Recurrence-Score Cohort. shows the characteristics of the study population that was included in this analysis — patients with tumors associated with a recurrence score of 0 to 10 (low-risk cohort) — as compared with the characteristics of the patients who had a score of 11 to 25 (midrange-risk cohort). There were no significant differences in tumor size between these two cohorts. There was a similar distribution of intermediate-grade tumors (59% in the low-risk cohort and 57% in the midrange-risk cohort), although there was a significant difference in the distribution of grade, including low-grade tumors (34% vs. 29%) and high-grade tumors (7% vs. 14%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). There were also significant but numerically modest differences between the low-risk cohort and the midrange-risk cohort with regard to age (median, 58 years vs. 55 years), menopausal status (postmenopausal status, 70% vs. 64%), progesterone-receptor expression (progesterone-receptor–positive, 98% vs. 92%), and type of primary surgery (lumpectomy, 68% vs. 72%) (P<0.001 for all comparisons by the chi-square test). Between April 7, 2006, and October 6, 2010, we enrolled 10,273 patients in the trial, of whom 10,253 were eligible to participate. A total of 1629 patients (1626 of whom were eligible [15.9% of the total eligible population]) had a recurrence score of 0 to 10 (indicating low risk), 6907 (6897 of whom were eligible [67.3% of the total eligible population]) had a score of 11 to 25 (indicating midrange risk), and 1736 (1730 of whom were eligible [16.9% of the total eligible population]) had a score of 26 or higher (indicating high risk). The median follow-up in the low-risk cohort was 69 months. Discussion We performed a prospective validation study of a 21-gene assay in patients with hormone-receptor–positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who had a low risk of recurrence according to clinicopathologic features but who nevertheless met established clinical guidelines for the recommendation or consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy. In patients who were found to have a low risk of recurrence on the basis of genetic-assay results and who were thus assigned to receive endocrine therapy alone, the risk of the recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site was less than 1% and the risk of any recurrence was less than 2% at 5 years. Recurrence events were uncommon regardless of histologic grade and were not significantly affected by younger age at diagnosis. In fact, in this low-risk population, the rate of recurrence events at 5 years was far exceeded by the rates of second primary breast cancers, other second primary-cancer events, and deaths from other causes, which resulted in a rate of invasive disease–free survival that was nearly 5 percentage points lower than the rate of freedom from recurrence (93.8% vs. 98.7%). Although adjuvant chemotherapy reduced the risk of distant recurrence and local–regional recurrence in the Early Breast Cancer Trialists meta-analysis, there was only a marginal effect in reducing the risk of contralateral breast cancer and no effect on the risk of second primary cancers or on nonbreast-cancer mortality after 15 years of follow-up in nearly 29,000 patients who had been randomly assigned to receive either chemotherapy or no chemotherapy.12 The low rate of distant recurrence observed in this prospective study is consistent with the rate observed at 5 years in the original prospective–retrospective validation study involving patients with a low recurrence score of less than 18 (2.1%; 95% CI, 0.6 to 3.7).14,15 The current prospectively conducted study supports the use of the 21-gene assay to spare the use of chemotherapy in patients who otherwise would be recommended to receive it on the basis of clinicopathologic features. These findings provide additional evidence supporting expert-derived clinical practice guidelines that recommend the use of this assay in patients with hormone-receptor–positive, axillary node–negative invasive breast cancer.21,24 Although this study clearly identifies patients who do not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, only 16% of the enrolled patients had a recurrence score of 10 or less. Approximately 67% of the patients enrolled in the trial had a midrange score of 11 to 25 and were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy or endocrine therapy alone. Continued follow-up is required in order to determine the effect of chemotherapy in this larger group of patients. Late recurrence that occurs after 5 years accounts for approximately one half of all distant recurrences in patients with estrogen-receptor–positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.25 There are several prognostic gene-expression assays for breast cancer,26 some of which are more accurately prognostic for late recurrence than others.27,28 However, the 21-gene assay predicts benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy,16,17 and chemotherapy prevents primarily early recurrences within 5 years after diagnosis.8 Therefore, although more recurrences are expected with longer follow-up, it is unclear whether these recurrences would have been prevented by the early administration of adjuvant chemotherapy. Extended adjuvant endocrine therapy beyond 5 years is effective in preventing late recurrence and may be considered when the treating clinician and the patient perceive a favorable benefit–risk ratio.29,30 The distribution of recurrence scores observed in this prospective trial differs from the distribution that was initially projected on the basis of observations in a prior prospective–retrospective validation study, which included 27% of patients with a score of 0 to 10, 43% with a score of 11 to 25, and 30% with a score of 26 or higher.14,16 This finding may be due to clinicians selecting patients for this study in whom there was therapeutic equipoise regarding the benefit of chemotherapy, which is reflected by the large proportion of patients who had tumors of 1.1 to 2.0 cm in the greatest dimension or tumors of intermediate histologic grade. However, the distribution of scores that was observed in this trial is similar to the distribution observed by the commercial laboratory during the same time period in which the study was conducted (score of 0 to 10 in 18% of patients, score of 11 to 25 in 62%, and score of ≥26 in 20%; Shak S, Genomic Health: personal communication). This finding indicates that the distribution of risk groups in the trial reflects clinical practice in the community and supports the generalizability of the study findings. The RASTER (Microarray Prognostics in Breast Cancer) study was a prospective validation study that evaluated a different multigene assay, the 70-gene signature, in 427 patients with axillary node–negative breast cancer.31 The 5-year rate of freedom from distant recurrence was 97.0% among patients with a low-risk signature on the 70-gene assay (51% of all patients) and 91.7% among those with a high-risk signature (49% of all patients).32 Decisions regarding adjuvant systemic treatment were based on the Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement 2004 guidelines, the 70-gene signature, and doctors’ and patients’ preferences. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given to 169 patients (81%) with a high-risk signature and in 33 (15%) with a low-risk signature. The outcomes observed in the RASTER study may therefore have been attributable, at least in part, to chemotherapy administered in selected patients in the low-risk group. The MINDACT (Microarray in Node Negative Disease May Avoid Chemotherapy) trial is a prospective trial in which patients were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy or no chemotherapy on the basis of clinical criteria or the 70-gene signature; enrollment has been completed and follow-up is ongoing.33 Although the results of the MINDACT trial are likely to provide important information, gene-expression assays bring added value by providing complementary predictive information that is independent of and does not correlate with clinicopathologic features in selected patients for whom this information may be clinically useful.34,35 Other ongoing trials (RxPONDER36 and OPTIMA37) are evaluating whether adjuvant chemotherapy is beneficial in patients with hormone-receptor–positive, HER2-negative breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes and a recurrence score of 25 or less. In conclusion, this prospective study involving uniformly treated patients with hormone-receptor–positive, HER2-negative, axillary node–negative breast cancer supports the clinical validity of the 21-gene assay in identifying patients who may be safely spared adjuvant chemotherapy. ||||| MAYWOOD, Ill. -- A major study published in the New England Journal of Medicine is providing the best evidence to date that a 21-gene test done on the tumor can identify breast cancer patients who can safely avoid chemotherapy. Oncologist Kathy Albain, MD, FACP, FASCO of Loyola University Medical Center and Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine is among the main co-authors of the international multicenter trial. Dr. Albain also is a member of the trial's steering committee. The test examines 21 genes from a tumor sample to determine how active the genes are. The tumor then is assigned a score between 0 and 100; the lower the score, the lower the chance the cancer will recur in distant organs if treated with only a pill such as tamoxifen. In previous studies involving fewer patients, a low score also suggested that chemotherapy does not work well and does not add to the survival benefit of tamoxifen. The clinical trial enrolled 10,253 women, including 41 at Loyola, who had a certain type of breast cancer (hormone-receptor positive, HER2 negative) that had not spread to lymph nodes. Although the lymph nodes were not involved, the tumors had other features that indicated chemotherapy should be given, followed by tamoxifen or other endocrine therapy pills. In the trial, women whose tumors scored 10 or lower on the 21-gene test received standard hormone therapy such as tamoxifen, but did not undergo chemotherapy. After five years of being followed closely, there was a less than a 2 percent risk the cancer had spread to nearby or distant sites. The five-year overall patient survival was 98 percent. These findings, researchers concluded, provide the highest level of evidence that the multigene test can spare the use of chemotherapy in women with low-scoring tumors who otherwise would receive chemotherapy. \\"This should provide a lot of reassurance to women and their physicians,\\" Dr. Albain said. \\"In women whose breast cancer scored low on the multigene test, there was outstanding survival with endocrine therapy alone. The test provides us with greater certainty of who can safely avoid chemotherapy.\\" In the trial, 15.9 percent of the women had a multigene test score of 10 or lower. An additional 68 percent had a mid-range score of 11 to 25. These women were randomly assigned to receive either hormone therapy plus chemotherapy or hormone therapy alone. Continued follow-up still will be needed to determine whether any women in this larger group, with tumors in the intermediate-score range, can safely forgo chemotherapy. # The multigene test, Oncotype DX Recurrence Score®, is made by Genomic Health, Inc.

FILE - In this Sept. 5, 2013 file photo, chemotherapy is administered to a cancer patient via intravenous drip in Durham, N.C. In a study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and results published... (Associated Press) The test accurately identified a group of women whose cancers are so likely to respond to hormone-blocking drugs that adding chemo would do little if any good while exposing them to side effects and other health risks. In the study, women who skipped chemo based on the test had less than a 1 percent chance of cancer recurring far away, such as the liver or lungs, within the next five years. \\"You can't do better than that,\\" said the study leader, Dr. Joseph Sparano of Montefiore Medical Center in New York. An independent expert, Dr. Clifford Hudis of New York's Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, agreed. \\"There is really no chance that chemotherapy could make that number better,\\" he said. Using the gene test \\"lets us focus our chemotherapy more on the higher risk patients who do benefit\\" and spare others the ordeal. The study was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. Results were published online Monday by the New England Journal of Medicine and discussed at the European Cancer Congress in Vienna. The study involved the most common type of breast cancer — early stage, without spread to lymph nodes; hormone-positive, meaning the tumor's growth is fueled by estrogen or progesterone; and not the type that the drug Herceptin targets. Each year, more than 100,000 women in the United States alone are diagnosed with this. The usual treatment is surgery followed by years of a hormone-blocking drug. But many women also are urged to have chemo, to help kill any stray cancer cells that may have spread beyond the breast and could seed a new cancer later. Doctors know that most of these women don't need chemo but there are no great ways to tell who can safely skip it. A California company, Genomic Health Inc., has sold a test called Oncotype DX since 2004 to help gauge this risk. The test measures the activity of genes that control cell growth, and others that indicate a likely response to hormone therapy treatment. Past studies have looked at how women classified as low, intermediate or high risk by the test have fared. The new study is the first to assign women treatments based on their scores and track recurrence rates. Of the 10,253 women in the study, 16 percent were classified as low risk, 67 percent as intermediate and 17 percent as high risk for recurrence by the test. The high-risk group was given chemotherapy and hormone-blocking drugs. Women in the middle group were randomly assigned to get hormone therapy alone or to add chemo. Results on these groups are not yet ready — the study is continuing. But independent monitors recommended the results on the low-risk group be released, because it was clear that adding chemo would not improve their fate. After five years, about 99 percent had not relapsed, and 98 percent were alive. About 94 percent were free of any invasive cancer, including new cancers at other sites or in the opposite breast. \\"These patients who had low risk scores by Oncotype did extraordinarily well at five years,\\" said Dr. Hope Rugo, a breast cancer specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, with no role in the study. \\"There is no chance that for these patients, that chemotherapy would have any benefit.\\" Dr. Karen Beckerman, a New York City obstetrician diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011, said she was advised to have chemo but feared complications. A doctor suggested the gene test and she scored very low for recurrence risk. \\"I was convinced that there was no indication for chemotherapy. I was thrilled not to have to have it,\\" and has been fine since then, she said. Mary Lou Smith, a breast cancer survivor and advocate who helped design the trial for ECOG, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, which ran it, said she thought women \\"would be thrilled\\" to skip chemo. \\"Patients love the idea of a test\\" to help reduce uncertainty about treatment, she said. \\"I've had chemotherapy. It's not pretty.\\" The test costs 4,175, which Medicare and many insurers cover. Others besides Oncotype DX also are on the market, and Hudis said he hopes the new study will encourage more, to compete on price and accuracy. \\"The future is bright\\" for gene tests to more precisely guide treatment, he said. ___ Marilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A gene test called Oncotype DX has shown that it can accurately determine which women with certain types of breast cancer can avoid chemotherapy without reducing their chances of surviving the disease. The results of a major study showed that women with a low score on the gene test had less than a 1% chance of their cancer recurring in the next five years, making chemotherapy unnecessary. This provides validation for the test which is already in use for helping women decide whether chemotherapy should be part of their treatment. This study showed the highest level of validation for the multigene test to safely spare the use of chemotherapy in women with low-scoring tumors who otherwise would receive chemotherapy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: School education is very important and useful. The students both learn knowledge and get educated. Yet, no one can learn everything from school. Scientists, such as Edison, Newton, Galileo and Einstein, didn't learn everything from school. They learnt a lot of knowledge outside school or practiced a lot themselves. A teacher, though he knows a lot, can't teach his students everything. The teacher's job is to teach his students how to learn, how to read and how to think. A good teacher with rich experience in teaching can teach his students the methods (=\\"ways)\\" of study. Through these methods students are able to learn and get a lot of things by themselves. Usually it's very easy for students to memorize some knowledge, but it is difficult to use it to solve problems. If a teacher really teaches students the ability of how to use knowledge, it means the teacher has learned lots of knowledge by himself(or herself). The success in learning shows he or she knows how how how to study.

Being in the center of what is colloquially referred to as Tornado Alley, it is prone to especially frequent and severe tornadoes, as well as very severe hailstorms and occasional derechoes. Tornadoes have occurred in every month of the year and a secondary smaller peak also occurs during autumn, especially October.

When a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements, because they are no longer confined to a specified volume in which they are close to each other; gas particles can move freely throughout their container. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. In the opposite direction, a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid. Because solids have very ordered structures, there are fewer possible arrangements of particles that would result in the properties associated with a solid. and the situation: George is going camping and forgot to bring water with him.

Title: The Patriot Movie plot: During the American Revolution in 1776, Benjamin Martin, a veteran of the French and Indian War and a widower with seven children, is called to Charleston to vote in the South Carolina General Assembly on a levy supporting the Continental Army. Fearing war against Great Britain, Benjamin abstains; the vote is nonetheless passed and, against his father's wishes, Benjamin's eldest son Gabriel joins the Continental Army. Four years later Charleston falls to the British and a wounded Gabriel returns home carrying dispatches. The Martins care for both British and American wounded from a nearby battle, before British Dragoons, led by the ruthless Colonel William Tavington, arrive, arrest Gabriel, and take captive the African American free men and women who work Benjamin's land. When Benjamin's second son Thomas tries to free Gabriel, he is shot and killed by Tavington, who then orders the Martins' house burned, and wounded Americans executed. After the British leave, Benjamin gives his next two eldest sons muskets, and they ambush the British unit escorting a tied Gabriel. Benjamin skillfully, yet brutally, kills many soldiers with his tomahawk. A British survivor tells Tavington of the attack, earning Benjamin the moniker of the \\"Ghost\\". Benjamin and Gabriel resolve to fight the British, leaving the younger children in the care of Benjamin's sister-in-law, Charlotte. On their way to the Continental Army's camp, they witness the southern Continental Army under General Horatio Gates engaging the British Army. Benjamin recognizes the foolishness of the action; sure enough, the Continentals are decisively routed. Benjamin meets his former commanding officer, Colonel Harry Burwell, who makes him colonel of the local colonial militia due to his combat experience. Benjamin is tasked with keeping Lord Cornwallis's regiments pinned south through guerrilla warfare. French Major Jean Villeneuve helps train the militia and promises more French aid.

Next question: who has the most saves in a mlb season?","completion":"The record for the most saves in a single Major League Baseball (MLB) season is held by Francisco Rodriguez. Francisco Rodriguez, also known as \\"K-Rod,\\" is a former professional baseball pitcher from Venezuela who played in MLB for several teams, including the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, New York Mets, Baltimore Orioles, Milwaukee Brewers, and Detroit Tigers. During the 2008 MLB season, Rodriguez, playing for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, set the record for the most saves with an impressive total of 62. This achievement broke the previous record of 57 saves, held by Bobby Thigpen, who set the mark in 1990 while pitching for the Chicago White Sox. Throughout his career, Rodriguez was known for his remarkable ability to close out games and seal victories for his team. A key component of his success was his devastating fastball and slider combination, which helped him generate a high number of strikeouts. K-Rod was a six-time All-Star and was also instrumental in helping the Angels win the World Series in 2002. In the world of baseball, saves are a crucial statistic for relief pitchers, particularly those known as closers, who are typically called upon to pitch in high-pressure situations at the end of the game. To be credited with a save, a pitcher must meet certain criteria, such as entering the game with a lead of three runs or fewer, pitching at least an entire inning, or entering the game with the potential tying run either on base, at the plate, or on deck. Though Francisco Rodriguez still holds the record for the most saves in a single MLB season, various other closers have enjoyed successful seasons and careers, such as Mariano Rivera, Trevor Hoffman, and Aroldis Chapman. While saves remain an essential gauge of a closer's effectiveness, other factors like ERA (earned run average), strikeouts, and WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched) also play a critical role in evaluating a relief pitcher's performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - A butterfly starts as an egg - The egg hatches - A larva emerges - The larva eats and grows - The larva sheds its skin - The larva enters a chrysalis - The pupa grows inside the chrysalis - The adult butterfly exits the chrysalis - The adult butterfly is now fully grown - The adult butterfly lays more eggs. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the chrysalis is disturbed happens, how will it affect less butterflies exit the chrysalis. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the chrysalis is disturbed during the butterfly's development, it may result in fewer adult butterflies successfully emerging from the chrysalis. The disturbance may have a direct or indirect effect on the entire process of the butterfly's life cycle. A detailed analysis of the potential impacts of this hypothesis is provided below. Direct effects: 1. Physical damage to the chrysalis: When the chrysalis is disturbed, it can lead to physical damage to its delicate structure. The chrysalis is a protective casing that houses the developing pupa, and any damage to the outer shell can be detrimental to the pupa's survival. This damage may cause deformities, hinder proper development, or even result in death, ultimately leading to a decrease in the number of butterflies that successfully emerge from the chrysalis. 2. Interference with the metamorphosis process: The process of metamorphosis is a complex one that involves a series of carefully orchestrated changes in the butterfly's body structure and physiology. When the chrysalis is disturbed, it can disrupt these processes, causing the pupa to be unable to develop into a fully functioning adult butterfly. This may result in immature or non-viable butterflies that are unable to survive or reproduce, reducing the overall butterfly population. Indirect effects: 1. Increased vulnerability to predators and parasites: A disturbed chrysalis could result in compromised defense mechanisms or even cause the developing butterfly to emit stress signals that attract predators or parasites. These natural adversaries may then prey on the pupa or adult butterfly, leading to a decrease in the number of adult butterflies that complete the life cycle. 2. Stress-induced developmental problems: The stress caused by the disturbance can have negative physiological and developmental effects on the butterfly. In some cases, stress can cause a delay in growth or trigger the release of stress hormones that affect the metamorphosis process. These changes might lead to developmental abnormalities or reduced survival rates in adult butterflies, thus decreasing the number of butterflies that emerge from the chrysalis. 3. Disruption of environmental cues and timings: Some butterflies rely on specific environmental cues to determine when to transition between life stages. If the disturbance of the chrysalis results in changes to the localized environment or disrupts the pupa's ability to perceive these cues, it may alter their developmental timeline. This can lead to mistimed emergence or unfavorable conditions for the adult butterfly, ultimately reducing its chances of survival. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis states that the disturbance of the chrysalis can directly or indirectly lead to a decrease in the number of butterflies that successfully emerge from the chrysalis. These effects can have a cascading impact on the butterfly's life cycle, potentially leading to reductions in the overall population. Further research and observations are necessary to determine the extent to which these disturbances influence butterfly populations in the natural environment and develop appropriate conservation measures if necessary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. Two gardeners started their planting season at the same time. Bill used mycorrizal fungi compost for the garden, while Hank used regular top soil. Bill was very happy with the harvest. Which gardener observed more improved water absorption from the soil? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Bill, the gardener who used mycorrhizal fungi compost for his garden, observed more improved water absorption from the soil.

When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are too high, the pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver. As blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced. When glucose levels are too low, another hormone called glucagon is produced, which causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose. Story: A doctor named Phil is researching how sugar affects the body. He noted when his participants ate a lot of sugar their livers would produce a lot more insulin than usual. The insulin would convert the sugar into glycogen. When they had a normal amount of sugar the amount of insulin was stable. He then had a person not eat at all and he found another hormone called glucagon was being produced. This hormone was converting the glycogen back into glucose, also known as sugar.

She meets Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), a law student who brings his 4-year-old son, Aaron (Ty Simpkins), to the park. Although Brad's marriage to Katherine (Jennifer Connelly) is loving and amicable, it has been lacking intimacy. When he is supposed to be studying for the bar exam, Brad instead plays on a local football team or sits and watches teenagers skateboard outside his house, fantasizing about being young and carefree again.

Start at 2, evaluating it as \\"1\\". To continue the explanation on how to convert from binary to decimal: After writing down the binary number 10011011, you will need to assign each digit with its corresponding power of 2, starting from right to left. The rightmost digit (also known as the least significant bit) starts with a power of 2 raised to the power of 0 (2^0), which equals to 1. Next, proceed to label each subsequent digit to the left with increasing powers of 2. For the given example of 10011011, the powers of 2 should look like this: 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 Now, multiply each binary digit (1 or 0) by its corresponding power of 2, and add the results. In this case: (1 × 128) + (0 × 64) + (0 × 32) + (1 × 16) + (1 × 8) + (0 × 4) + (1 × 2) + (1 × 1) = 128 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 155 So, the decimal representation of the binary number 10011011 is 155."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

GÃ©rard saw his sister kissing d'Artagnan goodbye or as d'Artagnan put it \\"she wanted to give me something to remember her by!\\" At Musketeer Headquarters, Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the Cardinal's Guards have disbanded the Musketeers as per the orders of Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry), the King's Minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with England. Rochefort confides to the Cardinal that there are three Musketeers that have refused to relinquish their duties: Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charlie Sheen). Upon reaching Paris, the headstrong d'Artagnan has a series of chance physical encounters with these same three Musketeers, resulting in d'Artagnan's accepting a duel with each one that very day. D'Artagnan arrives at the Ruins for his first duel; and, much to his surprise, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as Musketeers. But, before the duels can commence, the Captain of the Cardinal's Guard appears with orders to arrest the resistant Musketeers. Although d'Artagnan himself is not under arrest, he joins the three Musketeers in the ensuing skirmish, aligning himself with them. Displeased (but still impressed) by d'Artagnan's involvement, the Three Musketeers leave d'Artagnan behind. More of the Cardinal's Guards, led by Rochefort, arrive; and d'Artagnan is captured.

Options: - murky - confusing - invisible - misunderstood - teacher Explain why a human would choose \\"invisible\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human might choose \\"invisible\\" to answer the question above because the question implies a sense of contradiction or unexpectedness. In this context, the word \\"invisible\\" acts as a metaphor for something that is paradoxical, as it appears to be in direct contrast with the initial statement about the class being clear. When a class is clear, it means that the content is well-explained, easy to understand, and coherent. However, the question seems to push for an answer that seems to challenge or contradict this statement. By examining the given options, we can explore why \\"invisible\\" could be the chosen metaphorical answer: 1. Murky - This option is in contrast with the clarity of the class, but it does not convey the unexpectedness or contradictory nature implied in the question. 2. Confusing - Similar to murky, this option opposes the class being clear, but it does not capture the paradoxical element the question suggests. 3. Invisible - This option metaphorically represents a class that is so clear and easy to understand that it almost seems as though there is nothing to see or grasp. It draws upon the paradoxical concept of something being \\"too perfect\\" or \\"too good to be true,\\" prompting a human to select it as the best choice. 4. Misunderstood - Although this option seems to be contradicting the class's clarity, it does not have the same metaphorical or unexpected punch as \\"invisible.\\" 5. Teacher - This option doesn't fit the context or the structure of the question, as it seems unrelated to the comparison required by the sentence. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"invisible\\" to answer the question because it represents a metaphorical and unexpected response to the paradoxical nature of the question. By doing so, it challenges the perceived perfection and clarity of the class and invites the reader to entertain the possibility that there may be underlying layers or complexities not immediately evident."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ewood Park has been the club's home ground since its establishment in 1890, and it currently holds a seating capacity of around 31,367 spectators. Blackburn Rovers has a rich history in English football and is one of the founding members of both the Football League in 1888 and the Premier League in 1992. The club has won the English top division title three times: in the 1911-1912, 1913-1914, and 1994-1995 seasons. Additionally, Rovers have been winners of the FA Cup on six occasions and were runners-up in the Football League Cup once. Some notable players who have represented Blackburn Rovers throughout their history include Alan Shearer, who scored a record 34 goals in the 1994-95 season, leading the team to its Premier League title under then-manager Kenny Dalglish; Chris Sutton, who formed a prolific striking partnership with Shearer during the title-winning season; and Tim Flowers, the goalkeeper who played a vital role in securing the club's top-flight championship. The Blackburn Rovers fanbase is regarded as passionate and loyal, with Ewood Park often providing an intense atmosphere during home matches. The stadium is divided into four main sections: the Darwen End, the Jack Walker Stand (named after the club's former owner), the Riverside Stand, and the Blackburn End. Ewood Park has also served as a venue for national team matches, mainly for the England U-21 side, as well as music concerts and other sporting events. In recent years, Blackburn Rovers have experienced fluctuating fortunes, with the club currently (as of the 2021-2022 season) competing in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25. The Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one. Several of the Dulles controllers \\"observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\\" and notified Reagan National Airport.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all. He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted. In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an... answer the following question: What piece was composed as a tribute to Albert Libon?

Movie title: Fright Night II Movie plot: Fright Night Part II begins after the hellish events in the original Fright Night. Charley (William Ragsdale) now believes that Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon), was nothing but a serial killer posing as a vampire. As a result, he comes to believe that vampires never existed.Charley, along with his new girlfriend, Alex Young (Traci Lind), go to visit Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), who is again a burnt-out vampire killer on Fright Night much to the chagrin of the boy-who-cried-wolf Charley. It is while visiting Peter's apartment that Charley sees four coffins being taken into a car. On the way out from Peter's apartment, Charley sees four strange people walk past him, into an elevator. Charley instantly becomes smitten with one of the four, the alluring Regine (Julie Carmen). Charley drives Alex back to her dorm room and begins to make out with her, only to pull away and see Regine staring back at him. A ticked-off Alex storms off, not realizing that something is following her. Another girl leaves the dorm as Alex enters, and she is followed and killed by one of Regine's henchmen, Belle. Alex, meanwhile, is unaware that Louie, another of Regine's posse, is scaling up the wall outside her window, but he is startled and falls when Alex inadvertently slams her window shut on his hands. Bozworth ( Brian Thompson), the third heavy, makes fun of Louie before consuming some bugs.Meanwhile, later that night Charley dreams that Regine comes to visit him, only for her to turn into a vampire and bite him. The next day Charley talks to his psychiatrist who assures him that what he dreamed was only natural. Alex finds Charley bowling, per doctor's orders, and Charley agrees to go to the symphony with her. On his way there however he sees his friend Richie (Merritt Butrick) with Regine and opts to follow him. Charley climbs up to a fire escape outside of Regine's apartment, only to be horrified when he sees Regine and Belle attack and drain Richie's blood. Charley runs off to find Peter, and the two of them arm themselves... Answer:","completion":"In the movie Fright Night Part II, Charley begins to show signs of being a vampire by becoming sensitive to various elements commonly associated with vampire lore. One such sign is his increased sensitivity to sunlight, a classic vampire weakness. As a vampire, Charley would find direct sunlight extremely painful and potentially lethal, causing his skin to burn and possibly leading to his eventual death if exposed for too long. Another sign indicating Charley's transformation could be his heightened sensitivity to garlic. In many vampire stories and myths, vampires are repelled by the smell of garlic, and it is often used as a means of protection against them. This sensitivity can manifest itself in physical discomfort, coughing, sneezing, or even genuine pain when exposed to garlic. Additionally, Charley could also become sensitive to religious symbols, such as crosses or holy water. These items are believed to have the power to ward off evil spirits, including vampires. If Charley were to become increasingly bothered or repelled by religious items, it would indicate a gradual transformation into a vampire. Furthermore, Charley might experience a change in his appetite, developing a strong craving for blood. As a vampire, Charley would rely on the consumption of blood to sustain his newfound immortality, strength, and other vampire abilities. An insatiable thirst for blood would be another strong indicator that Charley is, in fact, becoming a vampire. Lastly, Charley could display a heightened sense of strength and agility, as well as accelerated healing abilities – qualities often attributed to vampires. The transformation into a vampire would grant him these supernatural powers, making him faster, stronger, and more resilient than an average human. In summary, Charley's transformation into a vampire in the movie Fright Night Part II may be indicated by the following signs: increased sensitivity to sunlight, garlic, and religious symbols, a strong craving for blood, and the development of enhanced physical abilities, such as strength and agility. By paying attention to these signs, it may become clear that Charley is indeed undergoing a slow and terrifying transformation into a creature of the night."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Really? \\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Genuinely?\\"?","completion":"To analyze whether the premise \\"Really?\\" entails the hypothesis \\"Genuinely?\\", we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the meaning of the premise and hypothesis. In this case, both \\"Really?\\" and \\"Genuinely?\\" are questions expressing doubt or seeking confirmation about the truth or sincerity of something. They show that the person asking the question is trying to clarify whether the information they received is trustworthy. Step 2: Determine the logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. Since both questions are meant to seek clarity or express doubt, they are logically connected. However, they are not statements with truth values and cannot be directly compared in terms of entailment. Entailment typically deals with the relationship between statements or propositions, where if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true as well. Step 3: Consider the implications of the premise being true. If the premise \\"Really?\\" is true, it tells us that the person asking the question is skeptical or seeking additional information to confirm the genuineness of a statement. However, since it is a question, the truth value of the premise cannot be accurately assessed. Step 4: Consider whether the implications of the premise being true also makes the hypothesis true. Assuming the situation in which one person is questioning another person's sincerity using the term \\"Really?\\", and the other party responds with \\"Genuinely?\\", it can be inferred that the hypothesis is being used to support or confirm the truth of the information. However, entailment does not apply between the premise and the hypothesis, as both are questions and not statements. In conclusion, while there is a logical connection between \\"Really?\\" and \\"Genuinely?\\" in terms of expressing skepticism and seeking clarity, they cannot be analyzed in terms of entailment. Entailment requires statements with truth values, and both the premise and hypothesis are questions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Who invented the Cobb salad? 2. What does \\"curb your enthusiasm\\" have to do with the question? Step 1: Finding out who invented the Cobb salad. The Cobb salad was created by Robert Cobb, the owner of the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood, California, in the 1930s. It is said that he hastily put together the salad late one night from leftover ingredients and the result turned out to be a hit. Step 2: Understanding the connection with \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" is an American television series created by Larry David, the co-creator of Seinfeld. There doesn't seem to be a direct connection between the invention of the Cobb salad and the show \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\\" However, it's possible that the user is referring to an episode or scene from the show that involves a mention or discussion about the Cobb salad. In this case, the scene would be a part of the show's script and storyline, not related to the actual invention of the salad. In conclusion, the Cobb salad was invented by Robert Cobb.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Options are: (A). yes; (B). it is not possible to tell; (C). no;","completion":"(B). it is not possible to tell. The two sentences provided contain different information, and a direct correlation between the truth of the first sentence and the truth of the second cannot be established based on the information given. Sentence 1: \\"i enjoyed talking to you in Lubbock\\" This sentence implies that the speaker enjoyed having a conversation with someone else while they were in Lubbock. This statement can be true without having any bearing on the second sentence, as it simply deals with the speaker's personal experience. Sentence 2: \\"The Lubbock public park is perfect for conversationalists.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the Lubbock public park and its suitability for people who enjoy conversing with others. It is a separate statement that doesn't rely on the first sentence to be true or false. To better understand this, let's analyze the provided options: (A). yes The first sentence being true doesn't necessarily mean that the second sentence is also true. The first sentence only talks about the speaker's experience while conversing with someone in Lubbock, not about Lubbock's public park or its suitability for conversationalists. Therefore, this option is incorrect. (B). it is not possible to tell This is the most reasonable answer. As the two sentences discuss different aspects and don't have a direct connection, it is impossible to determine the truth of the second statement based solely on the truth of the first statement. Without additional context or information, we cannot conclude anything about the second sentence. (C). no Choosing this option would mean that if the first sentence is true, the second sentence must be false. However, there is no basis for this claim, as the two statements don't have a direct connection or contradictory information. As such, this option is also incorrect.

Plant Variety: Dennis has a diverse selection of plants that bring a harmonious balance of varying sizes, colors, and textures to his garden. This assortment adds an element of charm and attracts various species of birds and butterflies, making it even more beautiful. 2. Placement and Design: Dennis has strategically placed his plants according to their growing habits and care requirements. By thoughtfully organizing the layout, he has effectively maximized the use of available space and ensured that each plant receives the necessary sunlight and water. 3. Regular Maintenance: Dennis pays attention to the needs of his garden by trimming and pruning overgrown plants, removing any dead leaves or flowers, and eradicating weeds. This meticulous upkeep enhances the garden's overall aesthetics and promotes healthy growth. 4. Fertilization and Soil Health: The health of plants is directly linked to the quality of the soil. Dennis consistently amends the soil with compost and organic matter, making it nutrient-rich and well-draining. The plants in his garden are visibly healthier and more vibrant as a result. 5. Irrigation: Dennis has set up an efficient irrigation system that provides adequate water to his plants without over or under-watering them. This not only conserves water but also ensures that plant roots get the right amount needed to thrive. 6. Accessories and Decor: Lastly, Dennis has tastefully incorporated ornamental features, such as garden art, benches, and charming pathways, which add character and appeal to the overall ambiance of his garden. In contrast, Ian's garden might lack some of these elements, which contributes to the disparity in the aesthetic value of the two gardens.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Given the background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). and the situation: There are two dairy farms in the town of Milkton and both are about the same size. Farm A produces only organic milk. Farm B does not but they are considering switching production to organic milk. Answer the following question: Which farm uses more pesticides, dairy farm A or B? A:","completion":"Dairy Farm B uses more pesticides than Dairy Farm A. This is because Farm A produces only organic milk, which involves a reduction in the utilization of pesticides compared to conventional milk production methods employed by Farm B. Organic farming practices focus on sustainable and environmentally friendly methods of agriculture, and one of the key principles is to limit or avoid the use of synthetic chemicals, such as pesticides, in favor of alternative pest and disease management techniques. On the other hand, Farm B, which currently practices conventional milk production, is likely to have a greater dependence on pesticides to protect their crops and maintain high yields per hectare. Conventional farming practices often involve the use of synthetic pesticides to manage pests and diseases, which may result in higher levels of pesticide use compared to organic farming methods. Overall, the difference in pesticide use can be attributed to the distinct farming practices employed by organic and conventional farms. In this case, Dairy Farm A, which produces only organic milk, uses fewer pesticides compared to Dairy Farm B, which is currently engaged in conventional milk production."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bond agents typically have offices near local jails or criminal courts, and they often have a lot of information about people who've been arrested or charges that have been filed. Much of a bond agent's business comes from being easily accessible and easy to find, so it should be easy to locate a number of bond agents nearby. Bond agent offices frequently are open late hours and weekends, so it may be easier to track down a bond agent than it is to call the jail. Particularly if the person has already been booked, a bond agent with an office near the jail may have information on whether the person has been arrested or is being held at the local jail. Even if you end up not using the bond agent to bail the person out, they typically are willing to provide you any information they may have. A bond agent also may be able to help you if you aren't sure about the person's legal name. If they were present when the person was booked, they may be able to recognize the person from a physical description. How much information a bond agent will have often depends on how busy the jail was on that particular night. If the bond agent is located in a small town or relatively rural area, you probably can get more information than if you live in a densely populated urban area. If the person has been arrested and booked in the local jail, and you want to help get them out, the bond agent can help you find out whether the person's bond has been set and what you can do to pay it. You also may be able to find this information by calling the jail. If the person hasn't been booked yet, the jail will let you know when that person's bail hearing will be held. Typically, the booking and bail hearing will be held within 24 to 48 hours of the time the person is arrested. If the person has special medical or other needs, talk to someone at the jail and find out what you can do to help or get needed medications to them.","completion":"A bond agent is a helpful person near jails who can give you information about someone arrested and can also help you pay money to get them out of jail if needed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, there is a difference in their focus - Question 1 simply asks for the best laptop in the given price range, while Question 2 specifies that the laptop is meant for students. Therefore, the answer for Question 2 may place more emphasis on features and functionalities that would be particularly useful for students while determining the best laptop. In order to provide a comprehensive answer, we will consider factors like performance, battery life, storage, display, and reliability, while also discussing what features might be more important for students within that budget. Best Laptop Under 30,000: 1. HP 245 G8 (Budget Laptop for Students) The HP 245 G8 is a versatile laptop that offers good performance and value for its price. Some of its key features include: - AMD Ryzen 3 3300U processor, which offers efficient multitasking and improved performance compared to Intel alternatives at this price point - 14-inch HD (1366 x 768) anti-glare display, which helps reduce eye strain during long work or study sessions - 8GB DDR4 RAM for smooth multitasking - 1TB HDD storage, providing ample space for documents, music, videos, and applications - Integrated AMD Radeon Vega 6 graphics, suitable for basic graphics tasks and casual gaming - Windows 10 Home operating system - Good build quality and decent battery life, lasting around 6 hours on a single charge Considering the needs of a student, this laptop should work well for basic tasks such as web browsing, document editing, and media consumption. Its solid build quality and decent battery life make it suitable for use in classrooms, libraries, or anywhere else a student might need to work. Although its display resolution and graphic capabilities are not top-of-the-line, it's unlikely that a student would need higher-quality visuals for studying or other academic tasks within this budget range. In addition, the HP 245 G8 sacrifices a sleek design for greater affordability and functionality, which is more important for a budget-conscious user such as a student. Overall, the HP 245 G8 offers an excellent balance of performance and value for money and is arguably the best laptop under 30,000 for students seeking a reliable device for their academic needs."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Antarctica is the coldest of Earth's continents. The coldest natural temperature ever recorded on Earth was −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F) at the Soviet (now Russian) Vostok Station in Antarctica on 21 July 1983. For comparison, this is 10.7 °C (20 °F) colder than subliming dry ice at one atmosphere of partial pressure, but since CO2 only makes up 0.039% of air, temperatures of less than −150 °C (−238 °F) would be needed to produce dry ice snow in Antarctica. Antarctica is a frozen desert with little precipitation; the South Pole itself receives less than 10 cm (4 in) per year, on average. Temperatures reach a minimum of between −80 °C (−112 °F) and −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F) in the interior in winter and reach a maximum of between 5 °C (41 °F) and 15 °C (59 °F) near the coast in summer.

Question: suppose less acid rain lands happens, how will it affect MORE waste being removed from the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"Less effect. Explanation: If less acid rain occurs, it means that there will be a decrease in the concentration of acidic substances in the environment, including in the water we consume. As acid rain typically contains pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), reducing the occurrence of acid rain will also decrease the amount of these pollutants entering our body through drinking water. Since our kidneys are responsible for filtering waste and excess substances from the bloodstream and turning it into urine, a reduction in such pollutants will lead to a decreased amount of waste to be processed by the kidneys. Consequently, the kidneys will have less waste to remove and dispose of through urine. In this case, the perturbation of reduced acid rain has a \\"less effect\\" on the amount of waste being removed from the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He won't be able to sell all of his cupcakes within the next week, so he has decided to store a portion of them in the freezer to preserve them for later. He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer. and a hint : Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. Besides the effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates, freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth. Please answer this question : Which temperature will result in faster decay of the cupcakes? Answer:","completion":"The temperature at which the cupcakes will decay faster can be determined by understanding the effects of freezing and the different temperature options available. As mentioned in the hint, freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. This occurs because lower temperatures reduce reaction rates and decrease water availability for bacterial growth. Between the two temperature options provided, 0° F (-17.8° C) and 10° F (-12.2° C), the lower temperature would generally be more effective in preserving the cupcakes for a longer period. At 0° F (-17.8° C), the decay of the cupcakes will be slower than at 10° F (-12.2° C). This is because the lower temperature further reduces the rate of chemical reactions responsible for food spoilage, and the growth of micro-organisms is significantly slowed down. Moreover, water in the cupcakes will be more frozen at 0° F, making it less available for bacterial growth and hence decreasing the chance of spoilage. On the other hand, at 10° F (-12.2° C), the decay rate will be faster due to slightly higher temperatures that might allow for slightly faster reaction rates and possible growth of cold-tolerant microorganisms. Additionally, the water content in the cupcakes might be more available at this temperature as compared to 0° F, providing more suitable conditions for bacterial growth. To sum it up, the temperature that will result in faster decay of the cupcakes is 10° F (-12.2° C). Robert should store his cupcakes at 0° F (-17.8° C) in the freezer to maximize their preservation and minimize spoilage. It is essential to maintain a consistent temperature and ensure that the cupcakes are stored in an airtight container/bag to prevent freezer burn and maintain their quality for a longer period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Photo by Charles Sykes/Invision/AP) (Associated Press) In freezing New York City's Times Square, a sea of horn-tooting, hat-wearing revelers cheered and some even smooched as the famed crystal ball dropped at midnight. Bronx-born U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor led the 60-second countdown and pushed the button that unleashed the shimmering orb with 2,688 crystals, a role usually filled by the New York City mayor. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, on his last day in office, sat out the celebration after 12 years on the job, while newly elected Mayor Bill de Blasio took the oath of office just after midnight at his Brooklyn home. Kerrie McConaghy, 20, a university student visiting Times Square from Armagh, Ireland, was dancing and jumping up and down, donning a big blue top hat. \\"It's unbelievable here,\\" she said. \\"The lights, seeing the ball, hearing the music, all the people. It's amazing.\\" \\"TV doesn't do this justice,\\" she said. \\"You have to be here to believe it.\\" Marcus Ix, 34, visiting from Germany, gave his wife, Sabrina, a big kiss when the ball dropped and confetti rained down. \\"This is the best New Year's Eve of my life,\\" he said as the crowd erupted with cheers and cries of \\"Happy New Year!\\" ''It was worth the 13 hour wait in the cold.\\" The annual New York celebration, which this year featured performances from artists such as Miley Cyrus, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis and Blondie, has become part endurance sport because post-9/11 security measures force spectators into pens at least 12 hours in advance, with no food, warmth or bathrooms. \\"We've got adult diapers. We're wearing them right now,\\" said 14-year-old Amber Woods, who came with friends from the New York City's suburbs to experience the event for the first time. They entered their corral at 10 a.m. Tuesday. For nourishment, they brought lollipops and popcorn. For the cold, they did a lot of jumping in place. \\"Every time I say, it's the last. But then I come back,\\" said Yasmina Merrir, a 42-year-old Washington, D.C., resident attending her fourth Times Square ball drop. In 2009, the cold was so bad, she got hypothermia. Her legs swelled up like balloons. Merrir was fasting and not drinking anything to deal with the lack of restrooms. As for the cold, she recommended vigorous dancing for as long as you can stand on your feet. \\"At a point,\\" she said, \\"your brain is not working anymore.\\" Las Vegas held one its biggest ever New Year's Eve celebrations, with sold-out concerts and an eight-minute long fireworks show that was billed as the largest in the country. The Minus5 Ice Bar Mandalay Bay started handing out free champagne for hourly toasts at 11 a.m. Tourists were seen toting novelty drinks into casinos by noon. Big-ticket musical acts Bruno Mars, John Legend and Maroon 5 helped lure 335,000 visitors to Las Vegas by nightfall on Tuesday — 5,000 more than last year, tourism officials said. On the other side of the Atlantic, London welcomed 2014 with a mixture of futuristic fireworks and torch-lit tradition. The city's mayor said this year's explosive display came packed with peach-flavored snow, edible banana confetti and orange-scented bubbles. The evening also included scratch-and-sniff programs, LED wristbands and fruit-flavored sweets. In Russia, where two suicide bombings in two days killed 34 people, eerily empty busses lumbered through the streets of Volgograd, where authorities canceled mass events for New Year's Eve and asked residents not to set off fireworks. President Vladimir Putin, in his New Year's Eve address to the nation, vowed that the fight against terrorists will continue \\"until their destruction is complete,\\" Russian news agencies reported. In Dubai, a Persian Gulf city known for glitz, glamour and over-the-top achievements like the world's tallest skyscraper, officials sought to break another record by creating the largest fireworks show. The Dubai skyline was a canvas for a dazzling 30-minute show. The display capped off with six minutes of fireworks that engulfed the city's man-made, palm-shaped island, with its fronds and trunk shimmering in thousands of lights. Organizers had promised that the fireworks would form a flying falcon, a sunrise and the United Arab Emirates flag. More than 260 people were injured by firecracker blasts and celebratory gunfire in the Philippines, a nation marking the end of a year of tragic disasters, including a Nov. 8 typhoon that left more than 6,100 dead and nearly 1,800 missing. \\"Many here are welcoming the new year after losing their mothers, fathers, siblings and children so you can imagine how it feels,\\" said village chief Maria Rosario Bactol of the Anibong community in Tacloban, the city worst hit by Typhoon Haiyan. \\"I tell them to face the reality, to move on and stand up, but I know it will never be easy.\\" ___ Associated Press writers Aya Batrawy in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia; Jim Gomez in Manila, Philippines; Kelvin Chan in Hong Kong; Ali Kotarumalos in Jakarta, Indonesia; Ken Moritsugu, Yuri Kageyama and Eric Talmadge in Tokyo; Louise Watt in Beijing; Hannah Dreier in Las Vegas and Colleen Long in New York City contributed to this report. ||||| Story highlights Revelers in London were treated to edible confetti choreographed to fireworks Dubai's huge firework show certified as largest by Guinness World Records 40,000 new laws go into effect in the U.S., some involving pot, placentas and shark fins A bar in Florida celebrates by lowering a drag queen from a giant shoe from the building Yes, it's New Year's Eve again, time to bust out the champagne and make resolutions you probably won't keep. But this year's different. Cities around the world were hosting some of the most amazing celebrations ever. Edible confetti raining over London? Check. How about 400,000 pyrotechnics exploding over Dubai? That happened, too. And let's not forget that the new year also means bizarre new laws Here's what people experienced across the globe: 1. Taste the rainbow Why have a fireworks show that only looks good? Revelers in London stuck out their tongues during Tuesday's extravaganza and enjoyed banana-flavored confetti that was choreographed to the fireworks. They also saw floating oranges drifting through the night sky and popped them to enjoy a citrusy scent! JUST WATCHED New Year's Eve Around the World Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH New Year's Eve Around the World 03:27 Food artists Harry Parr and Sam Bompas worked working on the show for an entire year. They even made sure their edible treats were kosher, vegan and hypoallergenic. \\"We developed a special confetti that's actually biodegradable, and in the rain it will magically dissolve,\\" Parr said. \\"Even better, it tastes amazing.\\" 2. Dubai goes big -- really big In Dubai -- a city obsessed with superlatives -- organizers pulled off a world record for the biggest fireworks display near the world's tallest building The spectacular show featured 400,000 pyrotechnics over 400 parts of the Dubai shoreline. That's 100 kilometers (62 miles) of waterfront lighting up. The Guinness World Records staff later labeled it the largest ever. The show blew Kuwait's world record out of the water when last year it set off 77,000 fireworks over 64 minutes. 3. Have a ball -- an 'odd' ball Sure, New York has a massive sparkly ball they've been dropping for the past century or so. But what other objects can you relinquish to gravity to mark the new year? The North Carolina mountain town of Brasstown prefers a possum -- slowly lowered and then set free. But Key West, Florida, takes the cake with its drag queen drop For years, female impersonator Gary \\"Sushi\\" Marion has been lowered from the Bourbon St. Pub in Key West while riding in a massive high-heel shoe. \\"It was inspired by 'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' when it first came out, with the whole high heel on top of the bus,\\" said Joey Schroeder, owner of Bourbon St. Pub. \\"I wanted to take that idea and do something fun on New Year's Eve.\\" 4. 25 hours of celebrations Samoa and American Samoa are virtually neighbors, with just 101 miles between them. But they're also 25 hours apart So one was among the first to ring in the new year; the other will be among the last. How can this happen? Let's just say the international date line isn't even close to a straight line And because the date line isn't fixed by any international law or agreement, it can zig and zag to accommodate government and business interests. It's as close to a time machine as we'll probably get. 5. Yes to placentas, no to shark fins More than 40,000 new laws will take effect in the U.S. on New Year's Day. While Colorado's legalization of marijuana has racked up plenty of headlines, here are some of the more peculiar ones: In Oregon, mothers will be allowed to take their placentas home from the hospital. Some say placenta capsules can help with postpartum depression, CNN affiliate KGW reported, though there's not a lot of medical research backing that up. Delaware will join a growing number of states where you can't own, sell or distribute shark fins, which is considered a delicacy in some East Asian cuisine. And thousands of companies will have to provide calorie counts for products sold in vending machines. Because if you're going to a vending machine, clearly you care the most about calories, right? Depends on what day of the resolution you're on. ||||| Summary:","completion":"People all around the world celebrated the beginning of 2014 with big parties and amazing firework shows.

Question: Where should a ventilation system be closed? Options: - house - office building - in the attic - hospital - large building Explain why a human would choose \\"hospital\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human might choose \\"hospital\\" as the answer to the question of where a ventilation system should be closed due to the following reasons: 1. Infection control: Hospitals are places where many people, including patients with various infections and diseases, healthcare professionals, and visitors, come together. Closing the ventilation system in a hospital can help to minimize the spread of airborne pathogens and germs, thus mitigating cross-contamination. 2. Maintaining a sterile environment: Certain areas of a hospital, such as operating rooms or intensive care units, require a high degree of sterility. Closing the ventilation system in these areas can help maintain a clean, sterile environment, preventing contamination that could jeopardize patient health and safety. 3. Controlled airflow: Hospitals often have specialized filtration systems designed to maintain optimal airflow and air quality. Closing the ventilation system in specific areas allows for better control over the airflow and distribution of filtered air, ensuring adequate conditions for patient care and treatment. 4. Energy efficiency: Since hospitals typically operate 24/7, they consume a significant amount of energy. Closing the ventilation system in certain areas or during periods of low occupancy can help save energy, reducing costs and environmental impact. However, it is important to note that closing the ventilation system may not always be the most appropriate action, depending on the context and specific needs of each location. The choice to close it should be determined by expert advice tailored to the unique requirements and circumstances of the given building."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 2007, Gabe Newell of Valve said \\"The PS3 is a total disaster on so many levels, I think it's really clear that Sony lost track of what customers and what developers wanted\\". He continued \\"I'd say, even at this late date, they should just cancel it and do a do over. Just say, 'This was a horrible disaster and we're sorry and we're going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it'\\". Doug Lombardi VP of Marketing for Valve has since stated that they are interested in developing for the console and are looking to hire talented PS3 programmers for future projects. He later restated Valve's position, \\"Until we have the ability to get a PS3 team together, until we find the people who want to come to Valve or who are at Valve who want to work on that, I don't really see us moving to that platform\\". At Sony's E3 2010 press conference, Newell made a live appearance to recant his previous statements, citing Sony's move to make the system more developer friendly, and to announce that Valve would be developing Portal 2 for the system. He also claimed that the inclusion of Steamworks (Valve's system to automatically update their software independently) would help to make the PS3 version of Portal 2 the best console version on the market. Who is Valve's VP of Marketing who says they want to hire programmers for a PS3 team? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"Valve's Vice President of Marketing who expressed the company's interest in hiring programmers for a PS3 team is Doug Lombardi. In response to criticism about the difficulty of programming for the PS3, Lombardi stated that Valve was actively looking to recruit talented PS3 programmers for their future projects. This suggests an interest in overcoming the challenges and unlocking the potential of the PS3 console for game development, despite initial negative comments about the system. This comment came as a restatement of Valve's position regarding the PS3, with Lombardi explaining, \\"Until we have the ability to get a PS3 team together, until we find the people who want to come to Valve or who are at Valve who want to work on that, I don't really see us moving to that platform\\". Understandably, building a dedicated team is critical for specializing in console-specific development, and overcoming the technical hurdles that come with it. It's also interesting to note that Gabe Newell, from Valve, later publicly recanted his previous critical statements about the PS3 at Sony's E3 2010 press conference. He cited Sony's efforts to make their system more developer-friendly as a significant reason for this change of heart, and went on to announce that Valve would be developing the game Portal 2 for the PS3. He further claimed that the inclusion of Steamworks, Valve's system for automatic software updates, would help make the PS3 version of Portal 2 the best console version on the market. So, while there have been perceived difficulties and initial negative comments in regards to developing for the PS3, both Lombardi and Newell have shown, in their statements and actions, Valve's willingness to work with and adapt to the PS3 system for the development of their projects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: A YORKSHIRE curry restaurant owner with a “cavalier attitude” to safety was today beginning a six-year jail term for the manslaughter of a customer with a nut allergy, after he supplied him with a curry containing peanuts. Paul Wilson, 38, was meticulous about his condition and asked for “no nuts” when staff at the Indian Garden, Easingwold, North Yorkshire, cooked his chicken tikka masala takeaway. Bar manager Mr Wilson was found slumped in the toilet at his home in Helperby in January 2014 and had died from a severe anaphylactic shock. Restaurant owner Mohammed Zaman was convicted of gross negligence manslaughter following a trial at Teesside Crown Court at which the jury was told he swapped almond powder in recipes for cheaper groundnut mix, containing peanuts, despite warnings. The case is thought to be a legal first which sets a precedent for food suppliers. Previously: Peanut allergy diner died after Yorkshire Indian restaurant owner ‘ignored repeated warnings’ Keith and Margaret Wilson, whose son Paul Wilson died after eating a takeaway curry from the Indian Garden, Easingwold The curry that killed him: Video shows allergy sufferer Paul Wilson ordering meal from Yorkshire restaurant Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, the Recorder of Middlesbrough, said Zaman had made a success of himself since coming to this country more than 40 years ago, building up his businesses and gathering a property portfoilio worth more than £2 million. “You threw all that away,” the judge said. “You have done so in pursuit of profit. “You have done so in such a manner as to bring about the death of another individual. Restaurant owner Mohammed Zaman (right) leaving Teesside Crown Court “Paul Wilson was in the prime of his life. “He, like you, worked in the catering trade. He, unlike you, was a careful man.” The judge said Zaman ignored warnings from officials after 17-year-old Ruby Scott suffered a reaction to a curry, three weeks before Mr Wilson’s death. He could have destroyed the groundnut mix then, but decided to continue to use it at his restaurants. The judge said Zaman had told “many lies” to the jury, adding: “You remain in complete and utter denial for what you have done.” This was not a “transitory” case of gross negligence, but one lasting seven months - from his fateful decision to switch almond for groundnut in June 2013. The court heard that Zaman, who owned six restaurants in York and North Yorkshire, was almost £300,000 in debt and cut costs by using the cheaper ingredient and by employing untrained, illegal workers. Mr Wilson bought a takeaway from the Indian Garden in Easingwold, North Yorkshire, in January 2014. After eating very little of it, he was found slumped in the toilet at his home in Helperby by his housemate. He died from a severe anaphylactic shock. Zaman was convicted of gross negligence manslaughter after the jury was told he swapped almond powder in recipes for the cheaper groundnut mix, despite warnings that it could endanger customers with allergies. After the verdict, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it showed that food suppliers had a duty of care towards their customers. Zaman, who owned six restaurants in York and North Yorkshire, cut costs by using the cheaper ingredient and by employing untrained, illegal workers. The prosecution said the owner had “put profit before safety” at the restaurants he owned. Zaman denied manslaughter by gross negligence, perverting the course of justice and six food safety offences. He was found guilty of all charges except perverting the course of justice. He claimed he left managers to run his restaurants and that included ordering stock and hiring staff. He was not on the premises when the curry was sold. Richard Wright QC, prosecuting, said: “Mohammed Zaman received numerous warnings that he was putting his customers’ health, and potentially their lives, at risk. “Tragically for Paul Wilson, Mohammed Zaman took none of those opportunities and ignored all of the warnings he was given. “His was a reckless and cavalier attitude to risk and one that we, the prosecution, would describe as grossly negligent.” Mr Wilson’s parents, Keith and Margaret, from Sheffield, said their son had carefully managed his condition since he was seven when he had a reaction to a Marathon chocolate bar. He loved curry but was always clear when ordering that his food must not contain nuts. They said: “Justice has been served, Paul can rest in peace. “We can’t go back and change the past, all we can do is focus on the present and the future and making things right. Don’t let this happen again.” Outside court, Detective Inspector Shaun Page said Mr Wilson’s death was “totally avoidable”. He added: “We have shown Zaman had a duty of care to serve safe food. “He has breached that duty to a criminal standard.” Martin Goldman, chief crown prosecutor with CPS Yorkshire and Humberside, said: “In this conviction, the CPS has sent a very clear message to the catering industry: there is a duty of care to your customers. “If you ignore your responsibilities and regulations and put lives at real risk then we will not hesitate to prosecute.” Alistair Webster QC, defending, said Zaman was a hard-working family man with no previous convictions. ||||| LONDON — The owner of an Indian restaurant in Britain with a “cavalier attitude” to food safety was found guilty on Monday of causing the death of a customer who had a severe allergy, after he was served a dish containing peanuts. The owner received a six-year sentence. It marked the first time in Britain that someone has been convicted of manslaughter over the sale of food. The customer, Paul Wilson, 38, ordered chicken tikka masala, to go, from the Indian Garden restaurant in North Yorkshire in January 2014, having specified “no nuts” in his order. Mr. Wilson had diligently avoided peanuts and dishes made with them ever since he had a severe reaction to eating a chocolate bar with peanuts when he was 7 years old. He was “very, very careful,” his mother, Margaret, said, especially when ordering his favorite meal. Mr. Wilson had eaten food from Indian Garden before, and the restaurant had gone so far as to write “no nuts” on the lid of his curry container. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But after just one bite of what would be his last meal, Mr. Wilson had an allergic reaction. His roommate found him slumped on his toilet at home, where he had gone into anaphylactic shock and died. Prosecutors said that the restaurateur, Mohammed Zaman, 52, who owns six restaurants, was about 300,000 pounds, or about 434,000, in debt. He had cut corners, they said, replacing almond powder in his recipes six months earlier with a cheaper mix of groundnuts, and hiring untrained, undocumented workers to turn out the popular curry dishes at his restaurants. Another customer with a nut allergy had to be treated at a hospital after eating at Mr. Zaman’s restaurant three weeks before Mr. Wilson’s death. Like him, she had been assured her meal would not contain nuts, prosecutors said. Mr. Zaman was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence in the death of Mr. Wilson, and six food safety offenses. He was sentenced to six years in prison. He had a “reckless and cavalier attitude to risk,” the prosecutor, Richard Wright, told a jury at Teesside Crown Court. “Time and again he ignored the danger and did not protect his customers,” Mr. Wright said at trial, adding that Mr. Zaman had “put profit before safety, and he cut corners at every turn.” Mr. Zaman had said that he left his employees to run his restaurants, including ordering the ingredients and preparing the dishes, and that he was not even on the premises when the deadly curry was prepared. Shaun Page, a detective inspector on the case, said that Mr. Zaman had a duty to serve safe food to his customers and that Mr. Wilson’s death was “totally avoidable.” According to Allergy UK, a nonprofit group, about 1 percent of Britons are allergic to peanuts. Up to 1.3 percent of Americans are allergic — as many as four million people, according to Food Allergy Research and Education. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that the number of children with food allergies is rising. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A Yorkshire curry restaurant owner has been sentenced to six years in jail for the manslaughter of a customer with a nut allergy.

Speaking of which - The liner notes are filled with repeating references to Ted Mason on this and that. How many times can you pat yourself on the back? The performances are really nothing special - so don't believe the hype. Bands like Oasis play this material a lot more convincingly. A very loose production. Buy something else- NOT THIS!

Context: Progression of pulmonary vascular disease limits heart transplantation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) to early infancy. Our objective was to assess the impact of bilateral pulmonary artery banding (PAB) on the operative courses of HLHS infants transplanted at ages older than 4 months.', 'Courses of all HLHS patients in our center who remained listed to age >or=120 days before heart transplantation were assessed. Patients undergoing transplantation after standard management (control group) were compared to patients having a prior pulmonary blood flow limiting procedure (PAB group).', 'Of 16 identified patients, one crossed over to stage I Norwood on day 185 and died post-operatively. Fifteen patients were transplanted at age >or=120 days (control group n=9, PAB group n=6). Four PAB patients had open PA band placement. Two PAB patients underwent experimental percutaneous bilateral internal pulmonary artery flow limiting device insertion. The PAB group mean age at banding was 141+/-54 days, and mean interval from PAB to transplant was 35+/-31 days (range 1.5-68 days). No differences in age at transplant, weight at transplant, warm graft ischemia time or total graft ischemia time were detected between groups. Mean times of mechanical ventilation (control 143+/-69h vs. PAB 44+/-13h), inhaled nitric oxide (control 126+/-70h vs. PAB 37+/-9h), inotropic support (control 171+/-64h vs. PAB 87+/-17h), intensive care unit (ICU) stay (control 8.3+/-2.7 days vs. PAB 4.5+/-1.4 days), and hospital stay (control 10.4+/-3.9 days vs. PAB 7.0+/-1.1 days) were all lower in the PAB group (P<0.05 all comparisons). Two control patients died, three required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and six did not tolerate primary chest closure. No PAB patient died or required ECMO. All PAB patients tolerated primary chest closure. All PAB patients had widely patent branch pulmonary arteries with no re-interventions to date. All hospital survivors remain alive (mean follow-up, control 50.2 months, PAB 11.5 months).Question: Does mechanical limitation of pulmonary blood flow facilitate heart transplantation in older infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome? A:","completion":"Task explanation: The task requires generating an answer to the question \\"Does mechanical limitation of pulmonary blood flow facilitate heart transplantation in older infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome?\\" based on the given context. Guidelines provided: The context provides information about a study involving patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) who underwent heart transplantation. It focuses on comparing the outcomes between the control group, who had no pulmonary blood flow limitation procedures, and the PAB group, who had a mechanical limitation of pulmonary blood flow through bilateral pulmonary artery banding (PAB). Steps to solve the task using guidelines: 1. Identify relevant information from the context: As we are looking for the effect of mechanical limitation of pulmonary blood flow on heart transplantation, we should focus on the outcomes between the control and PAB groups. 2. Extract relevant data from the context: - Mechanical ventilation time: control 143 +/- 69h vs. PAB 44 +/- 13h - Inhaled nitric oxide duration: control 126 +/- 70h vs. PAB 37 +/- 9h - Inotropic support duration: control 171 +/- 64h vs. PAB 87 +/- 17h - ICU stay duration: control 8.3 +/- 2.7 days vs. PAB 4.5 +/- 1.4 days - Hospital stay duration: control 10.4 +/- 3.9 days vs. PAB 7.0 +/- 1.1 days - Total deaths: control group 2 vs. PAB group 0 - ECMO requirement: control group 3 vs. PAB group 0 - Primary chest closure tolerance: control group 6 did not tolerate vs. PAB group all tolerated 3. Based on the data, generate an answer to the question: Yes, mechanical limitation of pulmonary blood flow through bilateral pulmonary artery banding (PAB) does facilitate heart transplantation in older infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The PAB group had considerably reduced times of mechanical ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide, inotropic support, ICU stays, and hospital stays compared to the control group. Additionally, there were no deaths or ECMO requirements in the PAB group, and all PAB patients tolerated primary chest closure, indicating better overall outcomes for the PAB group."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: When you are driving down a mountain you will notice the temperature decreases or increases? Text: Air in the troposphere is warmer closer to Earths surface. A:","completion":"When driving down a mountain, you will generally notice that the temperature increases as you descend. This observation can be understood based on the given text, which states that \\"air in the troposphere is warmer closer to Earth's surface.\\" The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere, and it extends from the Earth's surface up to approximately 8-15 kilometers (5-9 miles) in altitude, depending on the location and time of year. This is the layer where weather and climate occur, as well as the layer through which we tend to travel while driving. The temperature change as you go higher or lower in the troposphere is mainly due to the way solar energy is absorbed and re-emitted within this layer. The Earth's surface absorbs solar radiation and warms up as a result. This heat is then transferred to the air near the ground, making it warmer. As you move upwards in the troposphere, the air becomes cooler since it is further away from the Earth's surface and receives less of the heat energy transferred from the ground. This pattern of decreasing temperature with increasing altitude is called the \\"lapse rate\\" and typically accounts for a decrease of approximately 6.5 degrees Celsius (11.7 degrees Fahrenheit) for every kilometer (0.6 miles) in altitude gained. Thus, as you drive down a mountain and decrease your altitude within the troposphere, you will be moving towards the warmer air closer to Earth's surface. Consequently, the temperature will generally increase as you make your descent."},{"prompt":"Definition: In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things.

Input: Passage: Nicholas Rodney Drake (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter and musician known for his acoustic guitar-based songs. He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has since achieved wider recognition.Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20, while a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums, Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live or give interviews contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has been released, only still photographs.Drake is believed to have suffered from depression, reflected in his lyrics. After making Pink Moon, he withdrew from performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. At the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined as suicide.The 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree triggered a reassessment of Drake's music. By the mid-1980s, he was credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith, David Sylvian, and Peter Buck. In 1985, the Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a \\"doomed romantic\\" musician in the UK music press. The first Drake biography was published in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us. In 1999, his song \\"Pink Moon\\" was used in a Volkswagen commercial, resulting in an increase in his U.S. album sales.

Article: A lot of management training each year for Circle K Corporation, a national chain of convenience stores. Among the topics we address in our course is the retention of quality employees-a real challenge to managers when you consider the pay scale in the service industry. During these discussions, I ask the participants , \\"What has caused you to stay long enough to become a manager?\\" Some time back a new manager took the question and slowly, with her voice almost breaking, said, \\"It was a 19 baseball glove.\\" Cynthia told the group that she originally took a Circle K clerk job as an interim position while she looked for something better. On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused. Patricia handed her a box. \\"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\\" she said, \\"and I know that it is hard to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jessie because he may not understand how important he is, even though you have to pay bills before you can buy gloves. You know we can't pay good people like you as much as we would like to; but we do care, and I want you to know you are important to us.\\" The thoughtfulness, empathy and love of this convenience store manager demonstrates vividly that people remember more how much an employer cares than how much the employer pays.

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. - The Official World Golf Ranking is a system for rating the performance level of male professional golfers (although there is no rule prohibiting women from being ranked). It was introduced in 1986 and is endorsed by the four major championships and six major professional tours, five of which are charter members of the International Federation of PGA Tours: - Sir Nicholas Alexander Faldo, (born 18 July 1957) is an English professional golfer on the European Tour, now mainly an on-air golf analyst. A top player of his era, renowned for his single-minded dedication to the game, he was ranked No. 1 on the Official World Golf Ranking for a total of 97 weeks. His 40 professional wins include 30 victories on the European Tour and six major championships: three Open Championships (1987, 1990, 1992) and three Masters (1989, 1990, 1996). - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. - In golf the distinction between amateurs and professionals is rigorously maintained. An amateur who breaches the rules of amateur status may lose his or her amateur status. A golfer who has lost his or her amateur status may not play in amateur competitions until amateur status has been reinstated; a professional may not play in amateur tournaments unless the Committee is notified, acknowledges and confirms the participation. It is very difficult for a professional to regain his or her amateur status; simply agreeing not to take payment for a particular tournament is not enough. A player must apply to the governing body of the sport to have amateur status reinstated. - In golf, a caddy (or caddie) is the person who carries a player's bag and clubs, and gives insightful advice and moral support. A good caddy is aware of the challenges and obstacles of the golf course being played, along with the best strategy in playing it.

They are classified as an \\"independent contractor,\\" meaning that he or she is basically self-employed and does not receive any benefits or perks from his association with the club. Some clubs and resorts do have caddy programs, although benefits are rarely offered. Particularly in Europe, the vast majority of clubs do not offer caddies, and amateur players will commonly carry or pull their own bags. - Fanny Sunesson born in Karlshamn , Sweden is a retired professional golf caddy , who is most noted as being the caddy for Nick Faldo from 1990 to 1999 . - A golf course is the grounds where the game of golf is played.

One day, as Aaron was discussing an upcoming birthday party for one of their mutual friends, Justin expressed interest in making a cake for the event. Justin acknowledged that while he had spent some time creating simple dishes in the kitchen, he had never really delved into the intricate art of baking, particularly when it came to creating a decadent, multi-layered cake. Sensing an opportunity to bond over a shared passion and to mentor a friend in the fascinating world of baking, Aaron gladly offered to assist Justin in his endeavor. Together, Aaron and Justin spent the better part of a weekend planning and carefully selecting the best ingredients for their multi-layered cake. They browsed through numerous recipes and ultimately decided on a scrumptious chocolate sponge cake with alternating layers of rich chocolate ganache and velvety, cloud-like vanilla buttercream frosting. Aaron wanted to make sure Justin would develop a strong foundation in baking techniques, so they decided to add a few extra touches, such as the delicate art of piping and the creation of intricate sugar decorations to adorn the cake. In Aaron's well-equipped kitchen, Justin listened attentively as the experienced baker explained the importance of accurately measuring ingredients, the science behind the chemical reactions that occur while baking, and the significance of temperature control in the oven. As they carefully mixed, poured, and baked each individual layer, Aaron emphasized the significance of patience and the value of precision in each step of the process. Aaron demonstrated the proper way to level the cakes and how to stack them, ensuring that each layer was stable and uniform before continuing with the next. Finally, after several hours of hard work, laughter, and perhaps a bit of healthy competition, the two friends stood back and admired the towering, beautifully decorated multi-layered cake they had created together. Justin marveled at the level of craftsmanship and skill involved in making such an astounding dessert and expressed his gratitude to Aaron for the guidance and support. He couldn't wait to present the cake at the birthday party and share the story of how Aaron had shown him the joy, camaraderie, and love that can be found in the simple act of creating and sharing a delectable homemade cake. So, Aaron showed Justin how to make a multiple layered cake for the birthday because Aaron was an amateur baker.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: In practice, the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on the focal length of the lens, the diameter and quality of the input beam, and its wavelength (longer wavelengths require larger apertures). If the hole is too small, the beam quality is greatly improved but the power is greatly reduced. If the hole is too large, the beam quality may not be improved as much as desired. The size of aperture that can be used also depends on the size and quality of the optics. To use a very small pinhole, one must use a focusing lens with a low f-number, and ideally the lens should not add significant aberrations to the beam. The design of such a lens becomes increasingly more difficult as the f-number decreases. Now, I have a new situation: David needs to purchase a camera for his photography class. He went to the local consumer electronics store to find himself a good camera. Two cameras caught his eye, camera A and camera B. Camera A had a very small pinhole, but camera B had larger aperture. David needs to decide which camera should he buy. Answer this question please: Which camera would have higher beam quality? A:","completion":"Camera A with the very small pinhole would have a higher beam quality. A smaller pinhole usually results in a greater beam quality due to the reduced amount of diffraction and the ability to more precisely control the light passing through the aperture. However, it is important to note that the smaller pinhole in Camera A would also result in less light entering the camera and may require longer exposure times or higher sensitivity (ISO) settings. Camera B with a larger aperture allows more light to enter and is better suited for low-light situations, but the beam quality may not be as good as Camera A. David should consider his specific photography needs (e.g. shooting in low light, the importance of beam quality, and desired level of control over depth of field) when deciding which camera to purchase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you are a woman and marry an Emirati citizen, you will not automatically become an Emirati citizen. As a woman, you can get Emirati citizenship as a dependent of your husband, if your husband is an Emirati citizen. Women in the UAE are considered dependents either of their husbands or their fathers, regardless of whether they work or live independently. Women cannot pass on their Emirati citizenship. If you are a man and marry an Emirati woman, you will never be able to get Emirati citizenship as a result of being married to her, no matter how long the marriage lasts. Once you marry an Emirati citizen, you will generally have the right to reside in the UAE with your spouse. However, you will not have the benefits of being a citizen. When you get married, go to the General Directorate of Residence and Foreign Affairs (GDRFA). Bring your marriage certificate and identification. Tell them that you want to become a national, and they will give you forms to complete. If you are a man and marry an Emirati woman, any children your wife gives birth to will not be Emirati citizens. They will have to wait until they are 18 to apply for citizenship, and in the meantime you will have to pay for education and healthcare for the child that Emirati citizens get for free. If you marry an Emirati citizen, you will not become eligible for Emirati citizenship until you have been married for 3 years from the date you expressed your intent to become a national. Keep in mind this rule only applies to women who marry men who are Emirati citizens. A man who marries an Emirati woman will not be eligible for citizenship by virtue of the marriage. The UAE does not recognize dual citizenship. If you want to become an Emirati citizen through marriage, you must be willing to revoke any citizenship you currently have. Contact the embassy or consulate of your country of origin to find out what you need to do to officially revoke your citizenship. To apply for citizenship, your husband must complete a form and supply documents to the GDRFA that prove your identity and indicate your desire to become a citizen of the UAE. You will have to pay a fee for the request to be processed. You must be present with your husband when he submits the form and documents.","completion":"In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), women do not enjoy equal citizenship rights as men. Female Emirati citizens who marry non-Emirati men do not automatically pass on their citizenship to their husbands or children, making them ineligible for the benefits that Emirati citizens enjoy. Women's citizenship is considered dependent on their husbands or fathers, regardless of their employment status or independent living situation. As a consequence, male spouses of Emirati women are unable to apply for UAE citizenship through marriage, irrespective of the duration of their union. On the other hand, non-Emirati women who marry Emirati men can apply for UAE citizenship after being married for at least three years. Spouses of Emirati citizens, regardless of gender, are allowed to reside in UAE, but do not have the rights and benefits of citizenship. In order to apply for UAE citizenship through marriage, individuals must be willing to revoke their current citizenship as the country does not recognize dual citizenship. When seeking to apply for UAE citizenship via marriage, couples must visit the General Directorate of Residence and Foreign Affairs (GDRFA) with their marriage certificate and identification documents. They must complete the required forms and pay a processing fee. Husbands of non-Emirati women must submit additional documents to prove their spouse's identity and intent to become a UAE citizen. Furthermore, children born to male non-Emirati spouses and Emirati women are regarded as non-Emirati, and parents must bear the costs of education and healthcare services until the child turns 18 and becomes eligible to apply for Emirati citizenship. Overall, the citizenship rights of women in the UAE are limited and unequal compared to those of their male counterparts, presenting challenges and hindrances to both Emirati women and their non-Emirati spouses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The film, whose plot is based on Stephen King's novella The Body (1982) and title is derived from Ben E.

Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \\"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive.\\" Its creators hope that \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, \\"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused.

Q:I have a new situation: There are two dairy farms in the town of Milkton and both are about the same size. Farm A produces only organic milk. Farm B does not but they are considering switching production to organic milk. But I can use this background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). What is an answer for this question: Which farm uses more pesticides, dairy farm A or B? A:","completion":"Dairy farm B uses more pesticides because it follows conventional milk production methods.

It may not always be easy to know that you are interacting with someone that has bad intentions. One way to keep yourself safe is to keep a look out for common signs that the person you are interacting with is an online predator. Available choices: -- If your suspicions or behavior are displayed via various social media posts, suspicious questions and behavior, it may indicate a predator that is trying to scam you. See what your customers look for during business hours or clearly have questions about places they aren't in regular telephone conversations.; -- Pay attention to situations that do not make sense. For example, if one of your friends tries to scam you with phone numbers, this could happen over time.; -- Signs like bothering you or avoiding your friends or being secretive might include awkward calls or texts and/or missing your friend frequently. Suspicious behavior can be a sign that you may be in serious trouble.; -- If someone you interact with online demonstrates behavior that is in keeping with that of a predator, consider cutting off communication with them. If someone repeatedly asks you to skype with them or communicate via webcam, they may be an online predator.;","completion":"All right, imagine you're playing with your toys and talking to a new friend online, but sometimes they say or do things that make you feel a little uncomfortable, like asking too many questions or trying to know things that you shouldn't share with someone you barely know.

Although Gracie wants to join her brothers and neighbor Kyle in the nightly practices her father runs, she is discouraged by everyone except her older brother, Johnny. Johnny, Gracie and Kyle attend Columbia High School, where Johnny is the captain and star player for the varsity soccer team. After missing a shot at the end of a game, the despondent Johnny drives off with a friend's car and dies in a traffic accident. Struggling with grief, Gracie decides that she wants to replace her brother on the team.

Please answer a question about the following article about Aspirated consonant: In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), aspirated consonants are written using the symbols for voiceless consonants followed by the aspiration modifier letter ⟨◌ʰ⟩, a superscript form of the symbol for the voiceless glottal fricative ⟨h⟩. For instance, ⟨p⟩ represents the voiceless bilabial stop, and ⟨pʰ⟩ represents the aspirated bilabial stop. Written IPA consonants use symbols for what?","completion":"In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), written IPA consonants use symbols to represent specific speech sounds and phonetic characteristics of spoken languages. The symbols are designed to provide a standardized, unambiguous, and universal notation for the precise representation of various sounds produced in human speech. As stated in the article, aspirated consonants are written using the symbols for voiceless consonants followed by the aspiration modifier letter ⟨◌ʰ⟩. This modifier is a superscript form of the symbol for the voiceless glottal fricative ⟨h⟩. To better understand the role of symbols in the IPA, let's consider the example from the article: the voiceless bilabial stop ⟨p⟩ and aspirated bilabial stop ⟨pʰ⟩. In this case, the symbol ⟨p⟩ is used to denote a specific speech sound made by completely blocking the airflow at the lips (bilabial) and then releasing this blockage without vocal fold vibrations (voiceless stop). When the aspiration modifier ⟨ʰ⟩ is added to the symbol ⟨p⟩ to form ⟨pʰ⟩, it indicates an aspirated bilabial stop, which involves the same blocking and release of airflow, but with an additional burst of air (aspiration) upon the release of the stop. In summary, written IPA consonants use symbols to notate several aspects of speech sounds, such as the manner of articulation (e.g., stops, fricatives, and nasals), places of articulation (e.g., bilabial, alveolar, and velar), and phonetic features like voicing and aspiration. The symbols aim to facilitate accurate transcription and communication of speech sounds across languages, allowing linguists, speech therapists, and foreign language learners to better understand and analyze the phonetic structure and pronunciation of different languages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - riots - vote - change yourself - social activism - change clothes I believe the correct choice is \\"change yourself\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"I agree with your choice of \\"change yourself\\" as the correct answer for how to initiate change in society from within. Here's a step-by-step justification for this choice: 1. Self-awareness: Before attempting to change society, it's crucial to assess oneself and identify personal values, beliefs, strengths, and weaknesses. By being aware of one's own attitudes and behaviors, it becomes possible to recognize areas that may need improvement or change. 2. Personal development: Change starts with personal growth and self-improvement. Developing oneself will enable the individual to be a role model for others, ultimately encouraging a ripple effect of positive change in society. 3. Education: To contribute to societal change, one must be well-informed about the issues that need addressing. This includes being aware of existing social problems, understanding their complexities, and researching potential solutions. 4. Engaging in dialogue: Effective communication is essential for change to occur. Engaging in open and constructive dialogues with others helps to share ideas, challenge assumptions, and build empathy. This fosters the development of a collective understanding and desire to change. 5. Advocacy and allyship: By being an advocate for change and supporting marginalized communities, one can spark broader societal transformation. Allyship consists in using personal privileges to empower others, amplify their voices, and support social justice causes. When considered collectively, these steps demonstrate that changing oneself is a crucial component of initiating change from within. By focusing on personal growth and development, an individual can inspire change and serve as a catalyst for societal transformation, in contrast to more disruptive or superficial options like riots or changing clothes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In an overstuffed landscape of cinematic prowess, this film never manages to rise above its sea of mediocrity. The plot follows a group of seemingly unrelated individuals whose lives intersect in the most banal, predictable ways, culminating into a poorly executed twist ending. The formulaic nature of the storyline becomes increasingly frustrating as the audience is force-fed a barrage of clichéd situations devoid of any substance or innovation. It seems that the screenplay was lifted from an outdated playbook, rather than penned with any genuine thought or attention to detail. The characters in Dreamless Nights are as static and lifeless as the title suggests. Their motivations, dialogue, and emotions seem borrowed from other, better films, leaving the viewer yearning for something authentic and engaging. The acting, unfortunately, is lackluster and uninspiring, with most of the cast delivering their lines as if sleepwalking through their respective roles. This insipid mediocrity ripples throughout the film, robbing it of any chance of capturing the audience's empathy or interest. The film's cinematography operates on a similarly inadequate plane. Sporting an array of drab and uninspired visuals, Dreamless Nights is consistently monotonous, save for the sporadic and jarring jump-cuts. The color palette of the movie adds to its overall dreariness, often evoking a sense of gloom and despair instead of heightening the dramatic tension. Perhaps the cardinal sin of Dreamless Nights is its score – or rather, the lack thereof. The music is sporadic and inconsequential, with only the feeblest of contributions to setting the mood. More often than not, it seems as if the score has fallen into slumber, shattering the already fragile atmosphere. The potential for a captivating, immersive soundscape lies dormant, further cementing the film's failure to engage its audience. In conclusion, Dreamless Nights is a resounding disappointment – a tiresome, unimaginative slog through a minefield of clichés and contrivances. It stands as an example of wasted potential, both in terms of storytelling and visual innovation. It leaves the viewer with the unmistakable impression that the filmmaker entrusted the creative process to autopilot, resulting in a hollow and forgettable debacle.

When we're hungry, we eat at home instead of going out. We take buses instead of taxis. And we wear our old designer jeans just a few months longer. With college expenses at all-time highs, high school students are eager to do anything to cut the cost of a university education. One cost-cutting proposal is to allow college students to get a bachelor's degree in three years instead of four. Educational institutions have been actively exploring ways to make the learning process more efficient. But there's a question: Would the quality of undergraduate education suffer? Few US universities have formally approved a \\"three-year degree\\" model. I doubt that mainstream North American colleges will carry out a three-year curriculum any time soon. For one thing, most universities already allow highly qualified students to graduate early by testing out of certain classes and obtaining a number of college credits. In addition, at famous universities, the committee who determine which courses are required and which courses are electives are unlikely to suddenly \\"throw out\\" one quarter of the required credits. Professors will resist \\"diluting \\" the quality of the education they offer. In my opinion, a quality four-year education is always superior to a quality three-year education. A college education requires sufficient time for a student to become skilled in their major and do coursework in fields outside their major. It is not a good idea to water down education, any more than it's not a good idea to water down medicine. If we want to help students find their way through university, we should help them understand early on what knowledge and skills they need to have upon graduation. We should allow students to test out of as many courses as possible. We should give them a chance to earn money as interns in meaningful part-time jobs that relate to their university studies, such as the five-year co-op program at Northeastern University. ks5uks5u Options: A college students are offered the co-op program B electives' credits make up one quarter of the required credits C all students are required to finish four-year education before graduation D some excellent students can graduate ahead of time Answer: D some excellent students can graduate ahead of time Question: Answer:","completion":"Question: What option is mentioned in the article as a reason why a three-year degree model may not be widely adopted in North American colleges?

The royal couple were pictured being driven from Balmoral Castle to the nearby Crathie Kirk for Sunday morning prayers accompanied by the Earl and Countess of Wessex. Although the Queen and her husband were driven straight past waiting photographers, the pair could be seen sharing the back seat of a maroon Bentley. Recovered: The Queen was pictured sitting next to a newly healthy Prince Phillip as they drove to Crathie Kirk. Worship: The royal couple routinely attend services at Crathie Kirk while staying at Balmoral. The Queen, impeccably dressed as always, wore an elegant cream suit shot through with gold thread, teamed with a classic woven natural straw hat. Her husband, meanwhile, was dapper in a neat herringbone tweed suit paired with a patriotic tartan tie. The royal couple are currently enjoying their annual holiday in Scotland and have been joined by a succession of family members. Although the Earl and Countess of Wessex are currently in residence, last week brought a visit from Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, who shocked royal watchers by arriving with his former wife, Sarah Ferguson. Royal connection: All British monarchs since Queen Victoria have used Crathie Kirk while at Balmoral. Holiday: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh are currently enjoying a holiday on the 50,000 acre estate. Family: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were joined by the Earl and Countess of Wessex at church. The divorced couple flew to Aberdeen airport and were driven to the 50,000 acre estate with their daughters, Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice. Prince Charles and his wife Camilla are expected to make the trip north before the month and it has been reported that accompanying them will be the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their newborn son, Prince George. The birth of Prince George means that for the first time in more than a century, there are three direct heirs to the throne. Like his father, grandfather and great grandmother, Prince George is likely to be taken to a service at Crathie Kirk, which has been used by royal worshippers since 1848. Queen Victoria was the first royal to use the tiny church and all subsequent monarchs have followed suit. Highlights:","completion":"1.

(Photo: SUCHAT PEDERSON/THE NEWS JOURNAL SUCHAT PEDERSON/THE NEWS JOURNAL)Buy Photo Story Highlights Police call in beekeepers for help handling thousands of bees UPDATED STORY: Foam sprayed on bee swarms along I-95; drivers warned The ramp from northbound Del. 896 to northbound I-95 near Newark reopened about 6:50 a.m. Wednesday, more than 12 hours after it was closed when a tractor-trailer crashed and released its cargo of live bees -- an estimated 16 to 20 million of them. State police cited the driver, Adolpho Guerra, 55, of Miami, Florida, with having an unsafe load. Guerra suffered 50-100 bee stings and was treated at Christiana Hospital for what Sgt. Paul Shavack called minor injuries. Two passengers also were taken to the hospital for treatment of bee stings. The flatbed tractor-trailer was hauling 460 hives of honeybees from Florida to Maine when the load shifted about 6:10 p.m. on the Del. 896 on-ramp to northbound I-95, overturning onto the guard rail, Shavack said. DelDOT reported the right lane of northbound I-95 also was closed in the area overnight, but it was reported reopened at 5:45 a.m. Wednesday. By 7:30 a.m., only a few bees were observed in the area as passing motorists slowed to check out the site. ALERT: DelDOT warns of bee swarms along I-95 TRAFFIC: Truck gets stuck under I-95 ramp at mall Tuesday night, troopers had warned motorists of the closed ramp, as well as \\"transient bee swarms in the area.\\" CLOSE A tractor-trailer was hauling 460 hives of honeybees — an estimated 16 million to 20 million bees — from Florida to Maine when it overturned on the Del. 896 on-ramp to northbound I-95. (5/20/14) The two passengers, men ages 24 from Miami and 25 from Hialeah, Florida, were taken by ambulance to Christiana Hospital, Shavack said. He said both passengers suffered 50-100 stings but he had no update on their treatment Wednesday morning. Nearly an hour after the truck failed to negotiate the on-ramp curve, Shavack said bee swarms were so massive, \\"we can't even get close to the truck right now.\\" The odd cargo spill prompted state police to call in experts. \\"We contacted beekeepers to assist,\\" Shavack said, adding that three were advising on the scene. Instead of trying to round up the bees, he said, they suggested dispersing swarms with water. So firefighters from the Aetna Hose Hook & Ladder Company of Newark, coordinating with state troopers, began \\"hosing down the bees,\\" Shavack said. Within about an hour, hosing made \\"some progress,\\" but thick swarms continued to buzz around the wreck, he said. Police had to get rid of the bees before they could remove the tractor-trailer safely, he said. As the hose-down went on, Shavack noted that the response to the bee release was not impromptu. \\"The [emergency] communication center in New Castle County contacted headquarters communication center, and headquarters communication followed the plan that was in place before this occurred,\\" he said. The \\"bee swarm removal procedure\\" included a list of experts to contact, he added. \\"We got ahold of one of those bee providers, and he came right out,\\" he said. \\"He called for additional resources, so that's why there are three on-scene.\\" As far as the communication center staff members know, Shavack said, \\"this is the first time we've actually activated the plan.\\" But they didn't know how long the plan has been in place. The bee-hosing continued through dusk. The bee experts advised police that \\"when it's dark, the bees won't fly, the bees will crawl,\\" Shavack said. With nightfall, he said, the bee handlers could begin examining the crated hives to see if any could be salvaged before the truck was righted and hauled away. And the fate of the bees? Their long haul is over. The salvaging keepers – not identified by police – get to keep them. \\"They were authorized to do that by the trucking company,\\" Shavack said. No estimate was available of the full bee cargo's value or the count and value of those being salvaged. Reporter Damian Giletto contributed to this story.

CLOSE A truck hauling 460 hives of honeybees from Florida to Maine overturned onto its side about 6:10 p.m. Tuesday on the Del. 896 on-ramp to northbound I-95 at the outskirts of Newark, Delaware. (5/20/14) Read or Share this story: http://delonline.us/1nlNox6 ||||| How do you deal with up to 20,000,000 angry bees swarming a highway? That suddenly became top priority for the Delaware State Police, when a tractor-trailer hauling 460 crated hives overturned near Newark, Del., yesterday evening. Luckily, 14 years ago, someone had the unusual—if convenient—foresight to develop an “official honeybee swarm removal plan.” This is the first time they’ve had to use it, says police spokesman Sgt. Paul Shavack. Basically, the procedure involves calling a list of experts. Shavack told cbc.ca: Three on-call bee handlers were sent to the scene and [were] working with firefighters to spray water on the insects, the crates and the truck. \\"There's no rounding them up,\\" Shavack said of the bees. \\"The water will disperse and calm the bee activity.\\" But once darkness fell, the bee-hosing wound down. The bee experts advised police that \\"when it's dark, the bees won't fly, the bees will crawl.\\" Since bees are cold-blooded and their body temperature varies with external conditions, bees need to be warm for their flight muscles to work. (They are generally loath to fly in the rain, too, but whether they are avoiding the impact of rain drops or the potential chill has yet to be confirmed.) Twelve hours after the accident, the highway ramp was reopened. The driver and two passengers each suffered about 50 to 100 stings and were taken to hospital. The driver was later cited for unsafe shifting of a load in relation to a crash. They're lucky their cargo didn't include the vicious africanized bees, who recently showed up in Colorado, much to scientists' surprise. If you ever have the misfortune of getting caught in a swarm of disoriented and thirsty bees, here's a how-to for escaping. |||||","completion":"A tractor-trailer transporting approximately 16 million to 20 million honey bees from Florida to Maine overturned on I-95 near Newark on Tuesday, releasing the bees and causing major swarms in the area. The driver, Adolpho Guerra, was cited with having an unsafe load and suffered 50-100 bee stings. Two passengers were also taken to the hospital for treatment of bee stings. Carrying 460 hives of honeybees, the load shifted and overturned on the Del. 896 on-ramp to northbound I-95. The ramp was closed for over 12 hours as police and emergency personnel worked to disperse the swarms of bees and make the area safe for drivers. The unusual situation prompted state police to call in help from beekeepers. Three experts were called to the scene to advise on how to handle the massive swarms of bees. Their recommendation was to disperse the swarms with water, leading firefighters to hose down the bees alongside state troopers. As night approached, the bee handlers informed police that bees are less likely to fly at night, preferring to crawl. This allowed the experts to begin examining the crated hives to see if any could be salvaged before the truck was righted and removed from the scene. The trucking company authorized the keepers who helped with the salvage to keep any bees that were collected. Delaware State Police had an official honeybee swarm removal plan in place for 14 years, which involved calling a list of experts to assist in situations like this. This accident was the first time the plan had to be activated. The driver and passengers were lucky that the bees involved were not Africanized bees, which are known to be more aggressive and dangerous."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"The record for the most assists in a single NBA game is held by the legendary point guard, Scott Skiles. On December 30, 1990, Scott Skiles, playing for the Orlando Magic, dished out an incredible 30 assists in a game against the Denver Nuggets. This outstanding performance set a new NBA record, surpassing the previous record of 29 assists held by Kevin Porter since 1978. Scott Skiles was known for his extraordinary passing and playmaking abilities throughout his career, which spanned over a decade from 1986 to 1996. Despite his relatively modest stature at 6'1\\", Skiles was a strong and tenacious competitor, with a knack for finding his teammates in optimal scoring positions. His relentless work ethic and basketball IQ enabled him to excel as a floor general and leave an indelible mark in the NBA record books. The game in which Skiles set the record was a high-scoring affair, with the Orlando Magic emerging victorious with a 155-116 win over the Denver Nuggets. In addition to Skiles' mesmerizing assist performance, the game also featured impressive scoring displays from several of his teammates, including Terry Catledge, who scored a career-high 49 points. However, even for a player as skilled as Skiles, achieving 30 assists in a single game was no small feat and required a combination of exceptional factors to come together. The fast-paced and explosive nature of the contest, as well as the exceptional shooting performances from his teammates, played a crucial role in Skiles being able to create and capitalize on numerous scoring opportunities throughout the game. Despite several outstanding playmakers and passers entering the NBA since Skiles' time, his record of 30 assists in a game has stood the test of time and remains unbroken more than three decades later. Some notable players who came close to breaking the record are John Stockton and Rajon Rondo, both of whom logged 28-assist performances during their careers. Nevertheless, Scott Skiles' singular accomplishment in that memorable game against the Denver Nuggets in 1990 continues to stand as an enduring testament to his exceptional talent and playmaking prowess."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: SANAA The Air Force flew some U.S. diplomatic personnel out of Yemen on Tuesday and Washington told nationals to leave the country immediately after warnings of potential attacks that pushed the United States to shut missions across the Middle East. Yemen, one of the poorest Arab countries, is the base for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), one of the most active branches of the network founded by Osama bin Laden, and militants have launched attacks from there against the West. U.S. sources have told Reuters that intercepted communication between bin Laden's successor as al Qaeda leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, and the Yemen-based wing was one part of the intelligence behind their alert last week. Britain, which has already advised for more than two years that its citizens in Yemen should \\"leave now\\", announced it was temporarily evacuating all its embassy staff. Yemen is one of a handful of countries where Washington acknowledges targeting militants with strikes by drone aircraft. In the latest strike on Tuesday, a U.S. drone fired five missiles at a car travelling in the central Maarib province killing all four of its occupants, local tribal leaders said. Yemen's state news agency Saba said four al Qaeda militants were killed in the attack. The U.S. State Department's announcement urging Americans to leave the country follows a worldwide travel alert on Friday which prompted Washington to shut diplomatic missions across the Middle East and Africa. Some of its European allies have also closed their embassies in Yemen. \\"The Department urges U.S. citizens to defer travel to Yemen and those U.S. citizens currently living in Yemen to depart immediately,\\" the statement posted on its website said. \\"On August 6, 2013, the Department of State ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel from Yemen due to the continued potential for terrorist attacks,\\" it added. Previous U.S. travel warnings to Yemen had also advised citizens not travel to the country, but the language of the latest announcement appeared to reflect a more imminent threat. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said U.S. relations with Yemen remained strong despite the measures taken. \\"So this was, again, just to reiterate, a response to an immediate specific threat, but we continue to work with them on a number of issues,\\" Psaki told journalists at a news briefing in Washington. Britain also said on Tuesday it had withdrawn all staff from its embassy in the capital Sanaa, adding there was \\"a very high threat of kidnap from armed tribes, criminals and terrorists\\". The Netherlands advised its citizens to leave Yemen as a matter of urgency, local news agency ANP reported. France said it had not changed its previous advisory asking citizens to \\"be very cautious and to move around as little as possible,\\" Helene Conway-Mouret, junior Minister for French nationals abroad, told BFM TV. EVACUATION Restoring stability to Yemen - a country close to major shipping lanes and torn by regional and sectarian separatism and tribal violence as well as the al Qaeda insurgency - has been a priority for the United States. In a statement issued in Washington, Pentagon spokesman George Little said the U.S. Air Force \\"transported personnel out of Sanaa, Yemen, as part of a reduction in emergency personnel\\" in response to a request by the State Department. He did not specify which types of personnel were involved or where they were taken. \\"The U.S. Department of Defense continues to have personnel on the ground in Yemen to support the U.S. State Department and monitor the security situation,\\" the statement said. Yemeni Foreign Minister Abu-Bakr al-Qirbi criticized the measures but said they would not affect relations with the United States. \\"Unfortunately, these measures, although they are taken to protect their citizens, in reality they serve the goals that the terrorist elements are seeking to achieve,\\" Qirbi told Reuters. \\"Yemen had taken these threats seriously and had taken all the necessary measures to protect all the foreign missions in the country,\\" he added. The country's Supreme Security Committee issued a statement saying it had information al Qaeda was plotting attacks during Eid al-Fitr, this week's Muslim holiday that marks the end of the Ramadan fasting month. The committee also published a list of 25 senior al Qaeda militants it said were being sought by security forces and offered a bounty of 5 million Yemeni riyals (23,000) for information leading to their capture. \\"Information has become available that terrorist elements of the al Qaeda network were planning to carry out terrorist acts targeting public installations and facilities, especially in a number of Yemeni provinces, in the latter days of the holy month of Ramadan and during the Eid al-Fitr holiday,\\" it said. STABILITY Long-serving leader Ali Abdullah Saleh stepped down following months of protests against his rule in 2011, part of Arab uprisings that toppled three other heads of state. His replacement, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, met U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington last week. Yemen is home to 56 of the 86 detainees still being held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and security in Yemen is a key element of any deal to send them back so that Obama can fulfill a pledge to close the U.S. prison camp. Washington's warnings last week concerned possible attacks in the region, based on intelligence including intercepted communication between al Qaeda leaders. Some officials pinpointed Yemen as the main concern. No figures on the number of Americans in Yemen were immediately available. Washington had consistently cautioned citizens against travelling to Yemen since the protests in early 2011 that eventually forced Saleh to step down. Al Qaeda's Yemen-based branch AQAP has been behind plots against Western targets and neighboring Saudi Arabia. It claimed responsibility for a failed attempt by a Nigerian man to blow up a Detroit-bound trans-Atlantic airliner with explosives hidden in his underwear on Christmas Day, 2009. The United States has acknowledged killing Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen and al Qaeda preacher, in a drone strike in Yemen in September 2011. The Obama administration's policy allowing the killing of a U.S. citizen has been controversial.

It was widely reported on Monday that the closures follow an intercepted communication between al-Qaida leader Ayman Zawahiri and the chief of the terrorist organization's Yemeni affiliate. Supporters of the NSA's surveillance tactics have used the latest threat to justify their opposition to reining in the agency's domestic spying activities. But the information related to the latest threat was collected overseas under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act – not the bulk surveillance programs disclosed by the Guardian and the Washington Post thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden. White House spokesman Jay Carney distanced himself from those linking the scare to recent debates about the agency's surveillance power in the US. The White House and State Department also both sought to downplay the impact of the shutdown on the effectiveness of US diplomacy in the region, stressing the embassy closures should not be seen as indefinite. \\"This is a temporary measure and it is out of an abundance of caution,\\" said Carney. \\"We are engaged around the world and that engagement creates some risk. This decision is designed to reduce that risk but our engagement will continue.\\" In contrast to NSA supporters who have been quick to link the surveillance debate with the current scare, the White House sought to downplay any political implications. \\"I am not going to blend those two stories together,\\" added Carney. \\"We have a threat that we have advised the public about and we have a set of issues regarding the unauthorised disclosure of classified information that has led to a debate about the balance between protecting our security and maintaining privacy – I wouldn't blend the two issues.\\" The White House did however re-iterate its threat to boycott a planned bilateral summit with President Putin in Moscow in retaliation for its decision to grant temporary asylum to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Asked if there was any relationship between the embassy alerts and the recent NSA controversies, Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said \\"I can assure that in no way, at all, period, affects\\" the State Department's threat assessment. While the administration did not make the link, others did. On Sunday, Rebublican senator Saxby Chambliss said the NSA had identified threats that were the most serious for years and akin to levels of \\"terrorist chatter\\" picked up before 9/11. \\"These [NSA] programs are controversial, we understand that,\\" he told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. \\"But they are also very important … If we did not have these programs, then we simply would not be able to listen in on the bad guys.\\" Critics of the NSA surveillance programs were measured in their responses. Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democract who has been a longstanding voice against the bulk collection of phone records, said the latest threat was \\"serious\\". As a member of the Senate intelligence committee, Wyden receives classified briefings, but he added: \\"While I can't go into specific details, the vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee noted yesterday that this information was collected using section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, rather than the Patriot Act. I still haven't seen any evidence that the NSA's dragnet surveillance of Americans' phone records is providing any unique value to American counterterrorism efforts.\\" Privacy campaigners criticised the linking of the latest terror alerts with the debate over the domestic powers of the NSA. Amie Stepanovich, a lawyer with the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said: \\"The NSA's choice to publish these threats at this time perpetuates a culture of fear and unquestioning deference to surveillance in the United States.\\" News of the fresh terror alert came as Congress looked increasingly likely to pursue fresh attempts to limit the NSA's domestic powers when it returns in September. \\"The NSA takes in threat information every day. You have to ask, why now? What makes this information different?\\" added Stepanovich. \\"Too much of what we hear from the government about surveillance is either speculation or sweeping assertions that lack corroboration. The question isn't if these programs used by this NSA can find legitimate threats, it's if the same threats couldn't be discovered in a less invasive manner. This situation fails to justify the NSA's unchecked access to our personal information.\\" US embassies have been closed temporarily in response to similar perceived terrorist threats, but rarely for this long. Four embassies were closed for the first anniversary of 9/11 in 2002; six African embassies were closed for 3 days in June of 1999; and 38 embassies shut for 2 days in December 1998. \\"I don't want anyone to think we're leaning toward indefinite closure,\\" Harf said, emphasizing that many of the embassies would largely have been closed or on relaxed hours due to the Eid holiday. Harf said the threat \\"looks credible\\" in response to a question about whether it might have been a decoy once revelations of NSA surveillance became public. \\"We continue to refine our assessment of the threat,\\" Harf said. ||||| A suspected U.S. drone killed four alleged al-Qaida members in Yemen on Tuesday, as the U.S. and British embassies evacuated staff amid reports of a threatened attack by al-Qaida that has triggered temporary shutdowns of 19 American diplomatic posts across the Muslim world. Yemeni officials have suggested al-Qaida threats to multiple potential targets in the Arabian Peninsula country in recent days, including foreign installations and government offices in the capital Sanaa as well as to the strategic Bab al-Mandeb straits at the entrance to the Red Sea to the south. It is not clear if these reports are the same as the intelligence that led to the embassy shutdowns, reportedly instigated by an intercepted message between al-Qaida chief Ayman al-Zawahri and his deputy in Yemen about plans for a major terror attack. The State Department on Tuesday ordered non-essential personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Yemen to leave the country. The department said in a travel warning that it had ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel from Yemen \\"due to the continued potential for terrorist attacks\\" and said U.S. citizens in Yemen should leave immediately because of an \\"extremely high\\" security threat level. Britain's Foreign Office also said it has evacuated all staff from its embassy in Yemen due to increased security concerns. The Foreign Office said the British Embassy staff were \\"temporarily withdrawn to the U.K.\\" on Tuesday. It declined to comment further. Meanwhile, there has been a spike in apparent U.S. drone strikes against al-Qaida leaders. The attack Tuesday was the fourth in two weeks. Yemen officials say the drone fired a missile at a car carrying four men in the al-Arqeen district of Marib province, setting it on fire and killing all of them. They believed that one of the dead is Saleh Jouti, a senior al-Qaida member. To the west, in the capital Sanaa, residents awoke to the sound of an aircraft buzzing overhead. Officials said it was an American, and photos posted on Instagram appeared to show a P-3 Orion, a manned aircraft used for surveillance. All officials spoke anonymously as they were not authorized to brief the media. The rare overflight of the capital came shortly before the announcements of the evacuations. Yemeni authorities released the names of 25 wanted al-Qaida suspects on Monday, saying they were planning terrorist attacks in the capital, Sanaa, and other cities across the country. A statement from Yemen's Interior Ministry said the suspects were going to target foreign offices and organizations, as well as Yemeni government installations in the impoverished Arab country. It said security was beefed up around embassies, ports, airports, oil installations and power stations. Officials say potential U.S. targets in Sanaa could include the embassy and other buildings used by the United States to house personnel, as well as a military camp a few kilometers (miles) outside used by U.S. aircraft. The Yemeni statement said security forces will pay 23,000 to anyone who comes forward with information that leads to the arrests of any of the wanted men. They included allegedly senior figures in al-Qaida's Yemen branch, including Saudi nationals Ibrahim Mohammed el-Rubaish and Ibrahim Hassan el-Assiri. El-Rubaish was released from Guantanamo in 2006 and is believed to have played significant roles in al-Qaida's expanding offshoot in Yemen. He is a theological adviser to the group and his writings and sermons are prominent in the group's literature. Military officials meanwhile said the threat may be related to the Bab al-Mandeb, pointing to a visit by Defense Minister Gen. Mohammed Nasser Ahmed on Sunday to Yemeni military forces positioned at the Red Sea entrance some 276 kilometers (171.5 miles) south of Sanaa. Officials said that the visit came after intelligence that al-Qaida could be targeting foreign or Yemeni interests at the vital Red Sea corridor, which is a main thoroughfare for international shipping but also a crossing point of for smuggled weapons and illegal immigrants between east Africa and Yemen. Ahmed urged the forces to stay \\"on alert against any sabotage operations aiming at destabilizing the country,\\" according to officials. They also spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Washington considers the al-Qaida branch in Yemen to be among the terror network's most dangerous branches. The United States has also assisted Yemen's military in fighting the militants who, at one point during the country's recent political turmoil, had overrun large sections of land in the south. The group has also carried out bold assassination attacks on Yemeni security forces, killing hundreds over the past two years. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The United States flew diplomatic personnel out of Yemen and advised its nationals to leave the country immediately after warnings of potential attacks. Yemen is the base for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), one of the most active branches of the network founded by Osama bin Laden, and militants have launched attacks from there against the West. The latest strike involved a US drone firing five missiles at a car in Maarib province, killing all four occupants who were reported to be Al Qaeda militants. The US State Department's announcement urging Americans to leave the country follows a worldwide travel alert which prompted Washington to shut diplomatic missions across the Middle East and Africa.

Hasan al-Askari was born during a period when his father Ali al-Hadi, the tenth Imam, was suspected of being involved in a conspiracy against the Caliph Al-Mutawakkil. There is doubt as to whether al-Askari was born in Medina or Samarra. According to authentic shia hadith he was born in Medina on the 8th of Rabiul Akhar 232 Hijri (4 December 846 AD) and died in Samarrah Iraq on the 8th of Rabiul Awwal 260 Hijri (4 January 874) aged 28. The period of his imamate was 6 years. He was taken along with his family to Samarra in the year 230, 231 or 232 A.H., and was kept there under house arrest. In Samarra, al-Askari spent most of his time reading the Quran and the Sharia. According to Donaldson, al-Askari must also have studied languages, for in later years it was known that he could speak Hindi with the pilgrims from India, Turkish with the Turks, and Persian with the Persians. According to Shia accounts, however, it is part of the divine knowledge given to all Imams to be able to speak all human languages. It is said that even as a child, al-Askari was endowed with divine knowledge. One day a man passed by him, and saw that he was crying. The man told him he would buy a toy that he might play with. \\"No!\\" said al-Askari, \\"We have not been created for play.\\" The man was amazed at this answer and said, \\"Then, what for have we been created?\\" \\"For knowledge and worship.\\" answered the child. The man said \\"Where have you got this from?\\" Al-Askari said, \\"From the saying of God, Did you then think that We had created you in vain.\\" The man was confused, so he said, \\"What has happened to you while you are guiltless, little child?\\" al-Askari said, \\"Be away from me! I have seen my mother set fire to big pieces of firewood, but fire is not lit except with small pieces, and I fear that I shall be from the small pieces of the firewood of the Hell.\\" Al-Askari's mother, as in the case of the majority of The Twelve Imams, was a slave girl who was honoured after bearing children with the title Umm walad (mother of offspring). Her given name was Hadith, though some say she was called Susan, Ghazala, Salil, or Haribta. Al-Askari had other brothers, and among them was Ja'far who was also known as Ja'far al-Zaki or Jaffar-us-Sani. His other brother was Husayn, and together he and al-Askari were known as \\"as-Sibtayn\\", after their two grandfathers Hasan and Husayn, who were also called as-Sibtayn. Answer this question \\"How devoted was he to his beliefs?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Hasan al-Askari was highly devoted to his beliefs. Evidence of this devotion can be found in the text mentioning that he spent most of his time reading the Quran and the Sharia, and even as a child, he displayed divine knowledge and understanding of the purpose of life.

This sudden loss of the cherished pet, who belonged to her late cardiologist husband, has left Vasquez inconsolable, surrounded by memories of happier times. Elaine Vasquez had left her home for a short while, not suspecting that this brief absence would lead to such devastation. Upon her return, she found her house in shambles, as if a tornado had swept through, turning her life upside down. The frantic search for her four-legged family member led her to the closet, where the gruesome sight of the small dog's body left her shattered and tearful. The trail of blood was a morbid breadcrumb trail that the police followed, leading them from the chaotic living room, through the hallways, and ultimately to the heartbreaking scene. The local authorities in the quiet Florida neighborhood have launched a thorough investigation into the break-in and the brutal death of the dachshund. However, no suspects have been identified yet, and the community is left on edge. The impact of this tragedy runs deeper than the incomprehensible violence against an innocent animal. For Elaine Vasquez, this dachshund represented much more than a companion; it was a living reminder of her cardiologist husband, who had passed away not long ago. Their small and endearing pet had brought comfort and joy to the couple during their time together, and its presence had undoubtedly helped Vasquez cope with the crushing loss of her life partner. Friends and family offered their condolences and tried to console the devastated woman, but the magnitude of this loss seems almost insurmountable. Neighbors have come forward, expressing their sympathy and utter disbelief at the events that have unfolded in their previously peaceful community. While it's crucial that the local authorities conduct a thorough investigation and apprehend the perpetrators responsible for this heartless crime, it is also essential that the community comes together to support people like Elaine Vasquez. Pet owners and advocates for animal rights have a role to play in spreading awareness about the importance of our furry friends and the cruelty that is far too often inflicted upon them. Elaine Vasquez's tragic story serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerability of our pets and the irreplaceable bond we share with them. As her neighbors and the rest of the nation mourn the loss of this innocent dachshund, we must take a moment to cherish our own animal companions – and vow to better protect them in the future. In the meantime, the investigation continues, and the hope remains that the family will eventually find closure and justice for the senseless killing of their beloved pet.

The coded messages unravel a complex plan to unleash chaos through a series of highly-coordinated terrorist attacks in New York City, planned in the shadows for years by an elusive group known as The Pax Ultima. Their aim is to create a new world order by exploiting the city's vulnerable critical infrastructure. The clock is ticking, and Alma realizes that she is the only one with the knowledge to prevent a catastrophe of unprecedented scale. Faced with the enormity of the situation, Alma approaches the FBI and teams up with a seasoned agent, David Marks, who has an impressive career in counterterrorism. Despite their differences – Alma's academic background and David's no-nonsense approach to law enforcement – they form an unlikely partnership in an attempt to thwart The Pax Ultima's sinister plot. Their first breakthrough leads them to a New York City apartment, where they find encrypted blueprints and a treasure trove of information on the high-profile targets planned for attack. As they work tirelessly to decode the attack strategies, they face numerous obstacles: grappling with the perils of an increasingly powerful cyberworld, surviving encounters with The Pax Ultima's dangerous henchmen, and navigating an increasingly complex web of deception and sabotage. As the weight of the impending attack looms heavily on their shoulders, Alma and David are forced to reckon with personal demons, confront their fears, and reevaluate who they can trust. The stakes are raised further when the nefarious organization orchestrates simultaneous attacks around the globe, leaving the duo with mere hours to solve the final puzzle and foil the lethal plans set in motion for New York City. As they inch closer to unveiling The Pax Ultima's true identity and unearthing their ties with a sinister network, Alma and David face the ultimate test. What started as an academic researcher's pursuit of knowledge becomes a race against the clock, in which the fate of an entire city hinges on Alma's intellect and David's instincts. In a thrilling twist of events, Alma and David join forces with unexpected allies and unravel the last encoded message left in the century-old manuscript. The duo narrowly avert disaster, unmasking the Moriarty-like figure at the top of the organization, bringing the global conspiracy to a screeching halt. The Obscure Cipher tells a riveting, suspense-filled story of bravery, resilience, and redemption among unlikely heroes, united against an invisible enemy hell-bent on destroying the very fabric of society."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who does Anna remember meeting and killing?

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Encouragement and praise can come in many forms, and some ways are better for child development than others. Researchers at the University of Chicago who studied mother-child interactions found that the type of praise children receive affects their attitudes towards challenges later in life. Specifically, praise that focused on their behavior and the choices that kids made helped them deal with difficult experiences better five years later, compared with praise that focused more on the child himself, like \\"You're a good boy.\\" The study, which appears in the journal Child Development, is the first major study of praise and child development done outside of a lab setting. \\"It's exciting to see _ play out in the real world,\\" said Elizabeth Gunderson who led the study. \\"Praising the efforts, actions and work of kids is going to be more beneficial in their long-term persistence and desire to be challenged and work hard in the future.\\" Such \\"process praise\\" includes comments such as \\"You worked really hard\\", which emphasize a child's actions. \\"Person praise\\" includes comments like \\"You're so smart\\", which focus on a child's personal qualities. These distinctions aren't new in the field of psychology, but exactly how they affect children's development over the years hasn't always been clear. As part of the study, the researchers visited the homes of more than 50 kids between the ages of 1 and 3, and filmed their daily interactions with their parents during 90-minute sessions. Five years later, the researchers followed up with the families, measuring the children's attitudes towards challenges and problem solving. The children who grew up with more process praise were more open to challenges. Though person praise didn't seem to have any negative effect on the children, the study suggests that process praise teaches children that their talents and abilities can be developed and improved, while person praise sends the message that their abilities are fixed and therefore not easily changed. Answer:","completion":"Question: According to the study in the journal Child Development, which type of praise has a more beneficial impact on a child's long-term persistence, desire to be challenged, and ability to deal with difficult experiences?

Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: \\"It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible.

The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.

Information: - The is a period in Japanese history marked by social upheaval, political intrigue and near-constant military conflict. Japanese historians named it after the otherwise unrelated Warring States period in China. It came to an end when all political power was unified under the Tokugawa shogunate. - The Warring States period was an era in ancient Chinese history following the Spring and Autumn period and concluding with the Qin wars of conquest that saw the annexation of all other contender states, which ultimately led to the Qin state's victory in 221 BC as the first unified Chinese empire known as the Qin dynasty. Although different scholars point toward different dates ranging from 481 BC to 403 BC as the true beginning of the Warring States, Sima Qian's choice of 475 BC is generally the most often cited and popularly accepted one. The Warring States era also overlaps with the second half of the Eastern Zhou dynasty, though the Chinese sovereign, known as the king of Zhou, ruled merely as a figurehead and served as a backdrop against the machinations of the warring states. - Shinmen Sokan ( active 16th century ) was a Japanese lord , daimyo of the Shinmen clan ( Shinmen - shi ) during the middle of the Sengoku period . Sokan was known as a rather petty daimyo in the mountainous regions of Sakushu , which was west of Kyoto . Even though this was so , the Shinmen clan had very good ties with that of the Hirata family , leading to the Shinmen receiving a good amount of support . One such swordsman of note that served under Sokan was the famous Shinmen Munisai , the father of the legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi . In 1589 , Sokan ordered Munisai to kill Honiden Gekinosuke ( a minor student under Munisai ) for unknown reasons . Due to this fact however , Munisai was forced to leave his village of Miyamoto . - , also known as Shinmen Takez, Miyamoto Bennosuke or, by his Buddhist name, Niten Draku, was an expert Japanese swordsman and rnin. Musashi, as he was often simply known, became renowned through stories of his excellent and unique double-bladed swordsmanship and undefeated record in his 60 duels (next to 33 of It Ittsai). He was the founder of the Hyh Niten Ichi-ry or Niten-ry style of swordsmanship and in his final years authored , a book on strategy, tactics, and philosophy that is still studied today. - , which can be loosely translated as \\"the school of the strategy of two heavens as one\\", is a kory (ancient school), transmitting a style of classical Japanese swordsmanship conceived by the warrior Miyamoto Musashi. Hyh Niten Ichi-ry is mainly known for the two-swordkatana and wakizashikenjutsu techniques Musashi called \\"Niten Ichi\\" (, \\"two heavens as one\\") or \\"Nit Ichi\\" (, \\"two swords as one\\"). - Originally named It Yagor, he at the age of fourteen found himself in a little seaside village called Izu. Legend tells that he floated across the Sagami Bay on a piece of driftwood from shima Island, part of the Izu Islands. The trust of the local villagers was earned when Yagor chased away a group of bandits that went around raiding and pillaging. As he desired to be a great swordsman, the villagers paid for Yagor's travels in seeking out a master. On his journey, Yagor reached Tsurugaoka Hachimang Shinto shrine in Kamakura where he paid homage to the gods and practiced his swordsmanship. One particular day, an unknown assailant tried to attack Yagor but he somehow unconsciously and without thinking drew his sword and cut him down in one swift stroke. Not understanding this technique, Yagor would later describe it as \\"Musken\\" (), a fundamental aspect of his swordsmanship's philosophy. Musken is either an offensive or defensive technique that is delivered spontaneously and without thinking, fully anticipating an opponent's movement; a type of extra-sensory perception similar to mushin. - A was a samurai with no lord or master during the feudal period (11851868) of Japan. A samurai became masterless from the death or fall of his master, or after the loss of his master's favor or privilege. - Tokyo, officially Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital of Japan and one of its 47 prefectures. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the Kant region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from the old capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former and the . - The Tokugawa shogunate, also known as the and the , was the last feudal Japanese military government, which existed between 1603 and 1867.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A calendar is a system of organizing days for social, religious, commercial or administrative purposes. This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months, and years. A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system. A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a court calendar or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills. - Undecimber or Undecember is a name for a thirteenth month in a calendar that normally has twelve months . Duodecember is similarly a fourteenth month . - A day is a unit of time. In common usage, it is either an interval equal to 24 hours or daytime, the consecutive period of time during which the Sun is above the horizon. The period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation with respect to the Sun is called a \\"solar day\\". Several definitions of this universal human concept are used according to context, need and convenience. In 1960, the second was redefined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth, and was designated the SI base unit of time. The unit of measurement \\"day\\", redefined in 1960 as 86 400 SI seconds and symbolized \\"d\\", is not an SI unit, but is accepted for use with SI. A civil day is usually 86 400 seconds, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time. The word \\"day\\" may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, \\"On which day?\\" The life patterns of humans and many other species are related to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle (see circadian rhythms). - A month is a unit of time, used with calendars, which is approximately as long as a natural period related to the motion of the Moon; \\"month\\" and \\"Moon\\" are cognates. The traditional concept arose with the cycle of moon phases; such months (lunations) are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days. From excavated tally sticks, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age. Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period with respect to the Earth-Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today, and are used to divide the year. - Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future. Time is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. - A year is the orbital period of the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by changes in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility. In temperate and subpolar regions around the globe, four seasons are generally recognized: \\"spring\\", \\"summer\\", \\"autumn\\" and \\"winter\\". In tropical and subtropical regions several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual \\"wet\\" and \\"dry\\" seasons are recognized and tracked. - A week is a time unit equal to seven days. It is the standard time period used for cycles of work days and rest days in most parts of the world, mostly alongside (but not strictly part of) the Gregorian calendar. After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'undecimber' with the relationship of 'instance of'.

The animated comedy topped the box office once again this weekend, while \\"Rock of Ages\\" and \\"That's My Boy\\" delivered majorly disappointing debuts. Dreamworks' 145 million effort \\"Madagascar 3\\" roared a second time following its 60.3 million start. The CG-animated film dipped 41 percent to 35.5 million this frame. That's better than the second weekend decline of its predecessor, \\"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,\\" which fell by 45 percent and had earned a slightly softer 116.9 million at the same point in its run. \\"Madagascar 3\\" has grossed 120.5 million over ten days, and is headed to a 180 million finish domestically. Worldwide, the 3-D film has grossed a robust 278 million, and will likely finish near 600 million. Ridley Scott's \\"Alien\\" prequel \\"Prometheus\\" finished in second place for its second weekend, despite dropping by a hefty 60 percent to 20.2 million. Fox's 130 million sci-fi thriller has earned 88.9 million since invading theaters 10 days ago, and it may struggle to match it production budget domestically. Thankfully, the conversation-spurring flick has found 92.7 million overseas, giving it a worldwide total of 181.6 million. Although many prognosticators expected \\"Rock of Ages\\" to vie for the number one spot this weekend, the hair-metal Broadway adaptation couldn't convince audiences to join the mosh pit. Ages dropped like a rock, earning an abysmal 15.1 million in its debut — far less than comparative Broadway adaptations like \\"Mamma Mia!\\", which began with 27.8 million in 2008 and \\"Hairspray\\" (also directed by \\"Rock of Ages'\\" helmer Adam Shankman), which started with 27.5 million in 2007. Warner Bros. says the film cost 65 million to produce, and there's little chance it can match its production budget domestically after audiences, which skewed heavily female and decisively older, issued the film a mediocre \\"B\\" CinemaScore grade, suggesting that it won't benefit from word-of-mouth. Some are claiming that Rock of Ages' awful debut is a sign that Tom Cruise, who plays rocker Stacee Jaxx, may have lost his Midas touch at the box office. While the A-list star appeared heavily in ads for the film, in all actuality, he only serves as a minor character, and the musical is so far outside his action/drama wheelhouse that it's not a totally apt criticism. If there's a star to blame here (and, to be clear, I'm not sure there is — I'd bet the amateur look and sound of the movie is what kept audiences away), it's lead actress Julianne Hough, whose first three music-and-dance features since leaving \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" have all been relative box office disappointments. \\"Burlesque\\" found just 39.4 million in 2010, and \\"Footloose\\" achieved only 51.8 million last year — not a terrible result given its 24 million budget, but far below expectations. Hough may be Hollywood's go-to starlet for dance-heavy roles, but she's not yet a legitimate box office draw, and her \\"Rock of Ages\\" co-lead, Diego Boneta, certainly is not either. In fourth, Universal's 170 million tentpole \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" dipped just 40 percent (following a 59 percent decline last weekend) to 13.8 million in its third weekend. The Kristen Stewart/Charlize Theron showdown has earned 122.6 million so far (and another 124.6 million internationally) and seems headed for a finish of about 145 million domestically and 325 million worldwide. Whether those grosses are fair enough to justify the \\"Snow White\\" sequel reportedly in the works seems doubtful. Rounding out the top five is Adam Sandler's latest, \\"That's My Boy,\\" which, despite the presence of Saturday Night Live favorite Andy Samberg, earned only 13 million over Father's Day weekend. That's about half of what Sandler's last comedy, the Razzie-festooned \\"Jack and Jill,\\" earned in its debut (25 million), and his smallest opening for a traditional live-action comedy since \\"Happy Gilmore's\\" 8.6 million bow in 1996. \\"That's My Boy\\" received a discouraging \\"B-\\" CinemaScore grade from audiences (which were 54 percent male), with patrons under 18 giving the raunchy title an \\"A-\\" and those 50 and up issuing it a \\"D-.\\" If \\"That's My Boy\\" didn't carry an R-rating, perhaps more enthusiastic youngsters would have turned out over the weekend. The failure of \\"That's My Boy,\\" which cost Sony about 70 million, marks a pivotal moment in Sandler's career. For years, he reigned as the most consistent box office draw in Hollywood. Though his comedies — like \\"Mr. Deeds\\" (which earned 126.3 million), \\"Click\\" (137.4 million), and \\"Grown Ups\\" (162 million) — were usually critical misfires, they almost always opened in the 30-40 million range (or higher), and reaped major profits. It's not just that Sandler was starring in these films, either — he executive produced each of his 12 comedies that has earned over 100 million domestically. As a business-oriented filmmaker, no one could knock Sandler. But something changed with the release of Jack and Jill in late 2011. Critics utterly savaged the cross-dressing comedy, and audiences who had been willing to laugh at the silly antics of Sandler's amateur man-baby characters decided they had had enough. Jack and Jill became the star's first live-action comedy (I'm not including dramedies \\"Funny People,\\" \\"Punch Drunk Love,\\" or \\"Spanglish\\" — none of which Sandler produced) to miss the 100 million mark since 2000′s Little Nicky, and Jack and Jill finished with a weak 74.2 million. \\"That's My Boy\\" will be lucky to earn even half that amount. It seems that Sandler (and his longtime studio partner Sony) may need to rethink their strategy moving forward. His formula worked wonders at the box office for 15 years, but Sandler's shine is wearing off, and many of his formerly faithful paying customers are no longer amused. Elsewhere on the chart, \\"Men in Black 3\\" took in another 10 million and passed the 150 million mark. After four weekends, the 230 million production (though unceasing rumors suggest the budget was much higher) has earned 152.6 million domestically and 544.3 million worldwide. In limited release, Wes Anderson's \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" continued its remarkable run. Following an expansion from 96 to 178 theaters, the indie ticked up 40 percent to 2.2 million, giving it a per theater average of 12,253 — the strongest at the box office. After four weekends, Moonrise has found an impressive 6.8 million, and it's got lots of life left in it. 1. Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted -- 35.5 million. 2. Prometheus -- 20.2 million. 3. Rock of Ages -- 15.1 million. 4. Snow White and the Huntsman -- 13.8 million. 4. That's My Boy -- 13.0 million. See the full story at EW.com.

The film only pulled in 15.1 million in its debut, indicating audiences were not convinced to join the mosh pit despite hefty advertisement effort. The film's mediocre reception raised questions about the box office pull of star Tom Cruise, and lead actress Julianne Hough's track record was critiqued. However, it was also noted that the movie's look and sound likely contributed to the poor debut. \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" held fourth place, dipping to 13.8 million on its third weekend, while Adam Sandler's \\"That's My Boy\\" managed to pull in 13 million over Father's Day weekend. \\"That's My Boy\\" was noted to be a fall from grace for Sandler, as it performed substantially worse than previous Sandler led comedies. \\"Men in Black 3\\" passed the 150 million mark after four weekends while \\"Moonrise Kingdom,\\" in limited release, continued its remarkable run with a 40% uptake and a per theater average of 12,253.

First he offers her an ice cream made of snow and icicle, which she accepts. Next, he tries catching her a fish, but only succeeds in catching a pufferfish. Polly accepts it graciously, but when she swallows it, she begins inflating and deflating repeatedly until Peter makes her spit out the fish, which then returns to water. Peter shrugs in embarrassment, but, feeling humiliated, Polly slaps him and leaves to swim on a small iceberg. On the shore, Peter kicks himself for letting her get away, but then notices a sharkfin moving towards Polly's iceberg. He squawks a danger warning to her, but Polly ignores him, thinking that he's just begging for forgiveness that he won't get. Soon enough, the shark attacks Polly, who swims away in panic. Needing to act, Peter picks up a stick and charges out to help. The shark chases Polly around the bay for several minutes. When it looks like he has her cornered, Peter arrives and clobbers him on the nose. Enraged, the shark starts chasing after Peter. After several minutes of fighting and swimming away from the shark, Peter tries to escape by climbing up onto a cliff with a boulder on top. Peter unintentionally dislodges the boulder, which falls into the shark's mouth, who then swallows it. Due to the boulder's weight, the shark sinks to the bottom of the bay.

A: The answer is:","completion":"Dogs lose body heat through a variety of methods, and these are essential for regulating their body temperature and maintaining it within a safe and comfortable range. Here are the main ways dogs lose body heat and the justifications for each step: 1. Panting (Evaporative Cooling): Panting is one of the most efficient ways dogs lose body heat. When a dog pants, it exhales warm, moist air and takes in cooler, drier air. The evaporation of moisture from its tongue, mouth, and respiratory tract helps to dissipate heat, thus lowering the dog's body temperature. This is important because dogs don't have sweat glands all over their body like humans do, so panting is their primary means of cooling down. 2. Radiative Cooling: Radiative cooling occurs when a dog's body heat is transferred to the surrounding environment through the process of radiation. This happens naturally as the dog's body temperature is higher than that of the surrounding air. The greater the temperature difference, the more heat is lost by radiation. Providing access to cooler environments, such as shaded areas or air-conditioned rooms, can help enhance radiative cooling for dogs. 3. Conductive Cooling: Conductive cooling involves the transfer of heat between two objects in direct contact with each other, such as a dog lying on a cold surface, like a tile floor. By laying on a cooler surface, the dog's body heat transfers to the surface, thereby lowering its body temperature. This method of heat loss is particularly useful for dogs with thick coats, as they may struggle to dissipate heat effectively through panting alone. 4. Convection: Convection helps dogs lose body heat through the process of air (or liquid) moving over their body surface, carrying away heat. This can be natural, such as a breeze blowing over the dog's body, or artificial, like a fan blowing air over the dog. This method helps enhance the already-existing heat loss processes and supports the dog in maintaining a comfortable body temperature. 5. Vasodilation - Some dogs have the ability to dilate the blood vessels near the surface of their skin to help regulate body temperature. Vasodilation allows more blood to flow to the surface of the skin, promoting heat transfer with the cooler air around the dog, thus helping lower the body temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? Select from the following. a). No. b). Yes. Answer:","completion":"a). No. The provided answer needs to be updated, as it does not provide accurate and current information on the manufacturer of BlackBerry devices and the company's market standing. A more detailed and updated answer would be: BlackBerry was originally developed and manufactured by the Canadian company Research In Motion (RIM), which was founded in 1984. However, in 2013, RIM rebranded itself as BlackBerry Limited, adopting the name of its most popular product. The BlackBerry smartphones were known for their signature QWERTY keyboard, business-focused approach, and encrypted messaging system. In September 2016, BlackBerry Limited announced that it would no longer manufacture its own smartphones and would instead focus on software development and outsource the production of new devices. This change was a result of BlackBerry's diminished market share due to the increasing competition from other smartphone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung. In December 2016, BlackBerry Limited signed a licensing agreement with TCL Communication, a Chinese multinational electronics company, granting them the rights to design, manufacture, and sell BlackBerry-branded smartphones. This means that the current BlackBerry devices you see on the market are designed and manufactured by TCL Communication. In August 2020, BlackBerry and OnwardMobility, a US-based company, announced together with FIH Mobile Limited, a subsidiary of Foxconn, a new partnership to produce secure 5G BlackBerry devices. As part of the agreement, OnwardMobility will sell and market the BlackBerry devices, while FIH Mobile will handle the design and manufacturing. In summary, you should not validate the provided answer, as it is outdated and does not reflect the significant changes that have taken place in the company's manufacturing structure and the current partnerships that define the production and marketing of BlackBerry devices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the wake of recent local election triumphs, Venezuela's opposition has gained significant symbolic victories that signal a potentially encouraging shift in the political landscape. These victories engage a new narrative of justice and freedom, deeply rooted in the sentiments of Venezuelan citizens. Among those celebrating these symbolic triumphs is Patricia Gutierrez de Ceballos, who believes the votes represent powerful \\"sentences of justice and freedom.\\" The significance of her statement extends beyond just political assertion. Her husband found himself on the other end of governmental authority when he was arrested for allegedly failing to curtail anti-government protests. Hence, the victory is not just for her, but also depicts a triumph for Venezuelan citizens who champion the cause of democracy and freedom. Furthermore, the countrywide political mobilization is characterized by peaceful persistence, as confirmed by Rosa Brandonisio de Scarano. \\"The people will remain peacefully in the streets,\\" she states. Brandonisio de Scarano's insight echoes the silent yet profound intensity of Venezuelans determined to voice their hopes, concerns, and demands for an open, democratic society. The positive response and participation from large sections of Venezuelan society reflect the longing for a shift from prolonged political stagnancy. While these local election victories may be symbolic rather than transformative in the immediate sense, they indicate the direction in which Venezuelan citizens aspire to move politically. In summary, the recent local elections have given Venezuela's opposition a sense of emblematic triumph over past challenges. These victories, deemed as \\"sentences of justice and freedom\\" by Patricia Gutierrez de Ceballos, indicate a surge in favor of transparent governance.

There, you and your colleagues wait for a man to arrive from the capital, perhaps a thousand miles away, with a suitcase of cash. Few countries are as corrupt as Congo . Mobutu Sese Seko, a former strongman, used state funds to _ a Concorde to take him on shopping trips to Paris. By the time of his overthrow in 1997, graft was endemic. Government employees were not paid but rather expected to use their positions to make a living. Among the most prized government jobs was that of accountant: the people responsible for transporting bags of cash to the provinces to hand out to employees. In 2012, however, the Congolese government started helping civil servants to open bank accounts. Around three-quarters of them--some 670,000 people--now have one. In the process, the government has weeded out tens of thousands of ghost employees, since the embezzlers who invented them could not open accounts in their names without a matching ID. Yet in a vast country with fewer roads than Luxembourg, hardly anyone lives anywhere near a bank branch. So Congolese banks must now do the work the government accountants used to: shipping money to the remote area. Cash has to be transported to branches in regional capitals, and thence to account-holders on the backs of motorbikes, in canoes or by foot. Bank staff with suitcases of cash make easy targets, just as they did in the west of America in the 19th century. Though they usually travel with armed policemen, there have been at least ten armed robberies of bank employees since January. At the moment banks are little more than money-transfer companies, and not very sophisticated ones at that. The transfers tend to go only one way--out of Kinshasa--so cannot be netted against each other; instead cash almost always has to be moved physically.

Hypothesis: Tom also wondered: could we be one of God's dreams? Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Possible answers: (I) yes (II) it is not possible to tell (III) no","completion":"Answer: (I) yes. The premise and the hypothesis both put forth the idea that our existence might be a part of God's dreaming. To delve deeper into this idea, let's analyze both statements and their underlying philosophical implications. Premise: And (as Tom wonders in the book's opening line) are we all characters in one of God's dreams? This premise suggests that the protagonist Tom is questioning the nature of existence, specifically whether human beings and the entire world might simply be creations within a dream of a higher power, which is assumed to be God in this context. The idea that we could be a part of God's dream raises questions about the nature of reality and our place within it. Hypothesis: Tom also wondered: could we be one of God's dreams? The hypothesis is essentially a rephrased expression of the premise. It also presents the idea of human existence as potentially being part of a dream, dreamed by God. This hypothesis shares the same underlying philosophical questions and implications as the premise, as it brings to light the possible illusory nature of our reality and the possibility of our lives being shaped by a powerful external force. Now, let's discuss the entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. Entailment, in this context, refers to a logical relationship between the two statements such that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. In this case, both the premise and the hypothesis deal with the same core concept - that we might be part of a dream of God. The hypothesis can be seen as a paraphrased version or a reiteration of the premise. Given that they both express the same idea, if the premise were assumed to be true (i.e., Tom wonders about the possibility of our existence as part of God's dream), this would also lead to the truth of the hypothesis (i.e., Tom wonders if we could be one of God's dreams). Thus, we can conclude that the premise indeed entails the hypothesis, and the answer is (I) yes. Our existence being a product of God's dream is a recurring philosophical question that speaks to the innate curiosity humans have about the nature of reality and our role within it."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Therefore, if humans were to eat bears, they would likely be taking in less or more levels of toxic metals?","completion":"Mike is studying what humans eat. Since bears are higher up the food chain than mosquitoes, if humans were to eat bears, they would likely be taking in higher levels of toxic metals. The passage states that the higher up a food chain that humans eat, the greater the levels of toxic metals they take in. This implies that eating bears, which are positioned higher up the food chain, would result in more accumulated toxic metals ingested by humans compared to eating mosquitoes, which are lower in the food chain. The reason behind this phenomenon is a process known as biomagnification. Biomagnification occurs when toxic substances, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and other pollutants, become more concentrated in organisms as one moves up the food chain. These substances tend to accumulate in the fatty tissues of organisms and are not easily broken down or excreted. Consequently, these toxins become more concentrated with each trophic level in the food chain. For example, in an aquatic ecosystem, small organisms like algae may absorb heavy metals or other pollutants from the water. They, in turn, are consumed by small insects or zooplankton, which in turn are consumed by small fish, which are ultimately eaten by larger fish and so on. At each trophic level, the concentration of toxic substances increases. As a result, top predators such as bears, which consume a range of prey species, will have a higher concentration of toxic substances in their tissues than the organisms lower down on the food chain. When humans consume these top predators, they are exposed to these accumulated toxins, which can pose health risks. Therefore, it can be concluded that if humans were to eat bears, they would likely be taking in more levels of toxic metals as opposed to eating mosquitoes, which are lower down the food chain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd.

In A Double Life,Ronald Coleman surpassed himself as Anthony John, the tortured double personality. He put into that character all his talent and sincerity. The facial expressions, mannerisms,gait and stance spoke eloquently of what Anthony John was going through while playing Othello on stage. Coleman also did extremely well as a Shakespearean actor in those short scenes as Othello that were part of this gem of a movie. Closups of Coleman's face as Othello tortured by doubts about the fidelity of Desdemona were in themselves scenes worth watching.Add to that, his character's off stage desperation and only someone with Coleman's depth of acting perception can achieve. It was like watching Spenser Tracy as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, except this double role was much more profound and poignant. Shelly Winters looked so sweet, vulnerable and gorgeous at the same time and added her talent to the movie.

En route to California to prospect for gold, ex-sheriff Hooker, professional gambler Fiske, and bounty hunter Luke Daly are forced to stop over in a tiny Mexican village by engine trouble on the ship they are taking. A desperate Leah Fuller hires the three men and local Vicente Madariaga, to rescue her husband, John, who is pinned under debris from a gold mine cave-in in hostile Apache territory. During the harrowing journey, Luke tries to force himself on Leah late one night, forcing Hooker to intervene. Leah tells Hooker that where her husband is trapped, once was a boom town, but a volcano eruption wiped it out, leaving only a church steeple and the mine uncovered by lava. The resident priest called it the \\"garden of evil\\". The Indians now consider the volcano sacred. The group then arrives at the mine. They find John unconscious, and they free him. Before John wakes up, Hooker sets the man's broken leg. When John regains consciousness, he accuses Leah of using him to get gold. Hooker talks to Leah later, about what her husband said; after he tells her that he has spotted signs of Apaches nearby, she offers him and the others all the gold they have dug up to take her husband away that night, while she remains behind to make it look like they are all still there.

Context: Swift Rivers is a children's historical novel by Cornelia Meigs. Set initially in 1835 in Minnesota, it is a story of the early days of the logging industry, when logs were floated down the Mississippi to St. Louis. The novel, illustrated by Forrest W. Orr, was first published in 1931 and was a Newbery Honor recipient in 1933. Hypothesis: It won an honor in 1933","completion":"Based on the context provided, we can confidently draw the hypothesis that Swift Rivers, a children's historical novel by Cornelia Meigs, indeed received an honor in 1933. To understand the plausibility of this hypothesis, let us break down the context and analyze the relevant information in more detail. Firstly, Swift Rivers is described as a children's historical novel, highlighting that its target audience is young readers, and the story is set within a historical timeframe. The plot is set in the early days of the logging industry in Minnesota, around 1835, and revolves around the transportation of logs on the Mississippi River. The context also provides information about the author, Cornelia Meigs, and the illustrator, Forrest W. Orr. Cornelia Meigs is a notable name in the world of children's literature, and in combination with the historical setting and compelling narrative, it is reasonable to assume that the book has the potential to gain recognition in the industry. The most crucial piece of information supporting the hypothesis, however, is the statement that Swift Rivers was a \\"Newbery Honor recipient in 1933.\\" The Newbery Medal, along with its Honor recipients, is a prestigious literary award given to authors of distinguished children's books in the United States. The fact that the book received a Newbery Honor in 1933 directly supports the hypothesis. In conclusion, the context provided supports the hypothesis that Swift Rivers won an honor in 1933. Given that it is specifically mentioned that the book was a Newbery Honor recipient in that year, it is reasonable to assume this award recognition plays a significant part in the novel's reputation and highlights the importance of the story in shaping the children's literature landscape during that time. Therefore, the hypothesis holds true and aligns with the context given."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The \\"back to the earth\\" philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of the 70's was right on, as was the \\"don't ask don't tell\\" pseudo-liberalism of the fraternity made up of east-coast intellectuals, except that I would have thought this was more likely of a New England school rather than one in Virginia, where I imagine the \\"good ole boy\\" mentality still dominated even elitist schools like this one.

They have undertaken seven major world tours and scored multiple films. Pioneers in exploring the potential of CD-ROM and similar technologies, the Residents have won several awards for their multimedia projects. In October 2016, The Residents released Rushing Like a Banshee, the first single off their next album, alongside a video directed by John Sanborn. It was announced later found that it was part of a longer piece on The Ghost of Hope. In early 2017, they announced a new show, titled In Between Dreams, was to premier at the Blue Note in Tokyo, the first show in Japan since the 13th Anniversary Show. Rather than \\"Randy\\", \\"Bob\\" and \\"Rico\\", the show was to feature \\"The Real Residents\\", the \\"original\\" group featuring four members, much like their earlier years. Three of the members wore blue and white checkered suits, plague doctor masks with dark lenses and white bowler hats while the singer wore a cow-pattern bodysuit with a fake cow nose and plastic horns.

The decoration of the show consisted of a blue and white checkered (with the iconic eyeball with the top hat breaking the pattern every so often) backdrop, several dynamic and color changing lights, and the same giant ball screen from Shadowland for displaying videos in between every couple songs. The videos consisted of various well-known figures reminiscing of dreams they had; Richard Nixon's dream about being a blues singer, John Wayne's nightmare about a lone ballerina that disappears when he attempts to approach her, Mother Theresa's dream about a train wreck, and so on.

Roy Hodgson, England's head coach, is set to name Fabian Delph, Calum Chambers, Danny Rose, and John Stones in the national team's first squad since their disappointing World Cup campaign in Brazil. Nathaniel Clyne might also be included depending on Glen Johnson's injury status. The upcoming matches include a friendly against Norway at Wembley and a Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland in Basle. Step 2: Analyze the potential impact of the decision. By selecting young players, Hodgson is showing trust in fresh talent, hoping they can bring a new energy to the team. The decision to include Delph, Chambers, Rose, and Stones demonstrates Hodgson's commitment to rebuilding the England national team after the World Cup disappointment. Additionally, the possible inclusion of Clyne highlights Hodgson's attention to potential injuries and the need for reliable backup options. Step 3: Extrapolate potential benefits and drawbacks of the decision. Benefits: - The young players can bring fresh energy and enthusiasm to the national team. - The decision may motivate these players to perform at their best, knowing they have the trust of the head coach. - The inclusion of new players could lead to healthy competition among team members, pushing them to improve their performances in upcoming matches. Drawbacks: - The selected players may lack international experience, which could potentially impact their performance in high-stake matches. - Opting for younger players without considering experienced options might result in the team's overall performance suffering due to a lack of guidance and leadership on the field. - There could also be concerns regarding the squad's chemistry, as the younger players may take time to adjust to playing with their more experienced teammates. Step 4: Monitor and adjust the strategy. Hodgson should keep an eye on the progress of the selected young players during training sessions and in upcoming matches, making adjustments to the squad as needed. If these players perform well and adapt to the team dynamic, they could become reliable fixtures in the future. If, on the other hand, it becomes evident that relying solely on young talent isn't working, Hodgson should reconsider his strategy and perhaps integrate more experienced players while still nurturing the potential of younger members."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (6 May 1880 15 June 1938) was a German expressionist painter and printmaker and one of the founders of the artists group Die Brücke or \\"The Bridge\\", a key group leading to the foundation of Expressionism in 20th-century art. He volunteered for army service in the First World War, but soon suffered a breakdown and was discharged. In 1933, his work was branded as \\"degenerate\\" by the Nazis and in 1937, over 600 of his works were sold or destroyed. In 1938, he committed suicide by gunshot. - Modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s, and denotes the style and philosophy of the art produced during that era. The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation. Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art. A tendency away from the narrative, which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called contemporary art or postmodern art. - Expressionism was a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting, originating in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas. Expressionist artists sought to express the meaning of emotional experience rather than physical reality. - Die Brücke (The Bridge) was a group of German expressionist artists formed in Dresden in 1905, after which the Brücke Museum in Berlin was named. Founding members were Fritz Bleyl, Erich Heckel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. Later members were Emil Nolde, Max Pechstein and Otto Mueller. The seminal group had a major impact on the evolution of modern art in the 20th century and the creation of expressionism. - Erich Heckel ( 31 July 1883 in Döbeln -- 27 January 1970 in Radolfzell ) was a German painter and printmaker , and a founding member of the group Die Brücke ( \`\` The Bridge '' ) which existed 1905 - 1913 .

Choices: - seed - cell - dna - grain of pollen A: The answer is:","completion":"A: grain of pollen A grain of pollen can be described as a tiny male gametophyte enclosed in a tough capsule. Pollen grains play a crucial role in the reproductive process of flowering plants, as they contain the male genetic material needed for fertilization. Let's delve deeper into understanding pollen, its structure, and its significance in plant reproduction. Pollen is produced by the anthers, which are part of a flower's stamen – the male reproductive organ. The process of pollen formation starts with the development of microsporocytes within the anthers. These microsporocytes undergo meiosis to form four haploid microspores. Each microspore then develops into a pollen grain, containing a male gametophyte. Each pollen grain (male gametophyte) consists of two main parts: the vegetative cell and the generative cell. The vegetative cell is responsible for producing the pollen tube, which delivers the sperm cells (contained within the generative cell) to the female gametophyte during the process of fertilization. The tough capsule surrounding the pollen grain is called the exine, which is made up of a highly resistant biopolymer called sporopollenin. Sporopollenin protects the male gametophyte from various environmental factors, such as UV radiation, desiccation, and enzymatic degradation. Additionally, the surface of the exine is decorated with intricate patterns of ridges, spines, and grooves, which are species-specific and can be vital in helping the pollen grain adhere to certain pollinators for effective transfer to the female reproductive organs of another flower. In the process of plant reproduction, pollen grains are dispersed from the anthers of one flower and transported to the stigma of another flower within the same species. This transfer is facilitated by various pollinators, such as insects, birds, bats, and wind. Once the pollen grain lands on a compatible stigma, it germinates, forming a pollen tube. This tube grows through the style toward the ovary, enabling the delivery of sperm cells to the female gametophyte (embryo sac) for fertilization. Successful fertilization results in the formation of a seed, which eventually matures and is released for the development of a new plant. In summary, a grain of pollen is the correct choice because it represents the male gametophyte of a flowering plant, enclosed within a protective capsule. This intricate structure enables the pollen grain to play a pivotal role in plant reproduction, allowing for successful fertilization and the generation of new plants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the mother of the girl that the professor of French Literature is attracted to? is inside the article: In 1947, Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged European professor of French literature, travels to the United States to take a teaching position in New Hampshire. He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze, largely because he is romantically attracted to her adolescent daughter Dolores, also called \\"Lo\\", who he sees while touring the house. Obsessed from boyhood with girls of approximately her age (whom he calls \\"nymphets\\"), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and gets married to Charlotte only just to be near her daughter. Charlotte finds Humbert's secret diary and discovers his preference for her daughter. Furious, Charlotte runs out of the house, when she is struck by a car and killed. Her death frees Humbert to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with Lo, whom he nicknames \\"Lolita\\". Humbert and Lo then travel the country, staying in various motels before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job and Lo begins attending an all-girls Catholic school. However, Lo's increasing boredom with Humbert, combined with her growing desire for independence, fuels a constant tension that lead to a fight between them. Humbert's affection for Lo is also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty, who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of the pair's travels. Lo eventually escapes with Quilty, and Humbert's search for them is unsuccessful, especially as he doesn't know Quilty's name. Three years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Humbert asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He relents and gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually tracked young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for child pornography. Quilty abandoned her after she refused to be in one of his films., can you guess it ? The answer is:","completion":"Charlotte Haze. Justification: Given the information provided in the article, we can deduce that Humbert Humbert is the professor of French Literature.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Neptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.\\"?

Question: Which sea, separated from the Black Sea by the Strait of Kerch, suffered an ecological disaster in November 2007, when a fierce storm wrecked numerous oil tankers? Answer:","completion":"The sea in question is the Azov Sea, which experienced a significant ecological disaster in November 2007 as a result of a severe storm that led to the wreckage of numerous oil tankers. The Azov Sea, situated in the northeastern part of the Black Sea basin, is a relatively small and shallow body of water that lies between the southeastern European region of Russia and Ukraine. This sea is connected to the Black Sea through the Strait of Kerch, a narrow passage that serves as a vital route for maritime transport in the region. In mid-November 2007, a powerful storm hit the Strait of Kerch, causing massive waves to batter the vessels traversing the channel. Among the ships affected were several oil tankers, including the Russian-registered Volganeft-139, which was carrying over 4,000 tonnes of fuel oil at the time. Due to the storm's ferocity, the tanker broke apart, spilling a significant part of its payload into the sea. Other smaller spills occurred during the incident, involving multiple vessels transporting toxic substances such as sulfur and bitumen. The consequences of the 2007 Kerch Strait ecological disaster were severe and far-reaching. The spilled oil spread quickly across the Azov Sea, covering an area of approximately 80 square kilometers. The contamination adversely affected marine life, killing thousands of fish and birds, as well as posing a significant threat to the delicate ecosystems of the sea. Moreover, the oil spill wreaked havoc on the local fishing and tourism industries, with both experiencing substantial financial losses. In the aftermath of the disaster, emergency response efforts were launched by both Russian and Ukrainian authorities to mitigate the environmental damage. These efforts included deploying containment booms, skimmers, and dispersants to restrict the further spread of oil and limit its presence on the water's surface. Additionally, thousands of volunteers and military personnel participated in beach clean-up operations to remove oil deposits from the shoreline and rescue afflicted wildlife. The Kerch Strait ecological disaster of 2007 served as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities faced by seas like the Azov Sea in regard to human activities and maritime transport. The disaster brought to light the need for increased cooperation between bordering nations, more rigorous environmental regulations, and the implementation of enhanced safety measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. As a result, authorities on both sides have taken steps to strengthen maritime safety policies, improve emergency response capabilities, and promote environmental sustainability in the management of the Azov Sea and its surrounding areas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A drunk driver caused a gruesome car crash that took the life of his passenger who was celebrating his birthday on Friday night. Hugue Lapomarade, 31, was killed when driver Vladimir JeanPierre smashed his white minivan into a parked flatbed truck in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, in the early hours of Saturday morning. JeanPierre, 34, has been arrested and charged with manslaughter, reckless endangerment, vehicular manslaughter and drunk driving. Emergency crews had to cut the roof and doors off the vehicle to remove the people inside. The car, pictured in Brooklyn on Saturday morning, was driven by drunk driver Vladimir JeanPierre. Tragedy: The victim was removed from the car and taken to hospital, but was pronounced dead on arrival. The victim had been out celebrating his birthday before the horrific crash, which occurred at around 4.25 am on Saturday at 1304 Utica Avenue, East Flatbush. Barry Radow, who works at a local garage told the New York Daily News that police had told him the driver 'hit the tow truck so hard he pushed the truck forward five or six feet.' Wreckage: According to a witness, the car was driving so fast it moved the truck several feet. Horror: The car's roof had to be taken off to remove the driver and passenger after it hit a flatbed truck. Radow said: 'The car was a mess, they had to cut the roof off. It was really bad.' Emergency workers arrived at the scene and rushed Lapomarade to hospital, but he was pronounced dead on arrival. Police said it was not clear if the truck operator was at fault. The flatbed appeared to be double-parked when the white minivan, a white Nissan Quest, hit it.

Write a title for this article: HONG KONG — Protesters demanding democracy in Hong Kong delivered a stinging rebuff to the government late on Friday by reclaiming a street that police had forcibly cleared earlier in the day. Hundreds of demonstrators cheered ecstatically when, after hours of mounting tensions, the outnumbered police were ordered to retreat rather than risk an escalating confrontation. The action was centered on Nathan Road in the volatile Mong Kok neighborhood, an area teeming with shops and neon signs where demonstrators had blocked streets with barriers and tents and had snarled traffic for nearly three weeks, demanding a democratic ballot for choosing Hong Kong’s next leader. The police moved in early Friday morning and swiftly reopened all but a small area to traffic. But by evening the move had backfired, drawing the biggest crowds in weeks to the area and forcing the police to deploy hundreds of officers, many of them in full riot gear with helmets, batons and shields. Three officers were injured in the clashes, one with an unspecified head injury, the police said in a statement. It was not known how many protesters were hurt. As they have several times recently, the police used pepper spray to help quell the crowds. Alex Wong, a bank worker in his 20s wearing a medical mask, goggles and towel on his head, said he had come to Mong Kok to show his anger at the police operation. “I’m very scared,” Mr. Wong said. “But I’m here to fight for the future of Hong Kong. The price of democracy and freedom is not cheap.” Like many other protesters, he said he did not trust established political parties and student groups to negotiate effectively with the government. “Mong Kok is more the true voice of Hong Kong citizens,” he said. Guidelines issued by China’s national legislature in late September effectively guarantee that only pro-Beijing candidates can appear on the ballot for chief executive, the top position in Hong Kong, in the elections scheduled for 2017. The protesters say those rules violate commitments Beijing made when Britain returned the territory to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 after more than 150 years of British rule. Before the last three weeks, clashes between police and angry crowds were uncommon in Hong Kong, one of the world’s richest cities. It has a reputation for stability and good governance, and is home to the Asia headquarters for scores of multinational corporations, law firms and banks. The 1997 agreement called for the city’s British-based legal system and civil liberties to be preserved for 50 years after the handover to China. The scene at Nathan Road on Friday turned into a churning confrontation between hundreds of masked protesters and the police, who stripped away the protesters’ umbrellas and struggled to contain flare-ups with the surging crowd. Nearby, on Argyle Street, the police struggled on Friday to contain crowds as they chanted “Open the road,” and “Cross the street.” Several young men were hauled away by the police, prompting roars of disapproval from the crowd. Several of the masked protesters said they had no intention of charging at the police but wanted to show their support for the Mong Kok protest, which was more diverse and raucous than the main sit-in outside the government’s headquarters in Admiralty, where students dominate. “I came here to be a witness if there is police violence,” said Mani, an office assistant who declined to give her surname. “We don’t want violence. Most of the police are not bad men, but we’ve seen the illegal things they have done.” Though many protesters in the crowd wore goggles and surgical masks, now customary protections against pepper spray, most appeared reluctant to challenge the police cordons. “I want to reoccupy Mong Kok,” said one goggled university student who gave only his first name, Simon. “This was supposed to be our road for occupy.” Title:","completion":"\\"Protesters Win Back Street in Hong Kong's Fight for Democracy\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A. wilderness B. rainforest C. mountains D. swamp E. burrow The best answer is Answer:","completion":"B. Rainforest Marmosets, which belong to the family Callitrichidae, feel safest in their natural habitat, the rainforest. These small, tree-dwelling primates are native to the Central and South American rainforests, particularly in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Amazon Basin. The rainforest offers an ideal environment for marmosets, as it provides abundant food resources, protective cover, and ample opportunities for social interactions. Marmosets primarily feed on tree sap, fruits, insects, and small vertebrates, all of which are readily available in a rainforest ecosystem. The dense foliage of the rainforest provides multiple layers of vegetation, which allows marmosets to forage safely and efficiently while remaining hidden from potential predators such as birds of prey and larger primates. Furthermore, rainforests are home to a diverse array of plant and animal species, which encourages the biological and ecological stability necessary for marmosets to thrive. In addition to providing an abundance of food resources, the rainforest also offers ample opportunities for marmosets to establish and maintain complex social structures. Marmosets are known for their highly social behavior and live in groups consisting of multiple families, with each family usually composed of a breeding pair and their offspring. Living in a group provides protection from predators, as well as providing opportunities for cooperative foraging and coordinated defense. The dense canopy and diverse vegetation of the rainforest create the perfect living space for these groups to establish their territories and interact with other marmoset groups. The other options (A. wilderness, C. mountains, D. swamp, and E. burrow) do not provide the same level of safety and resources for marmosets as their preferred rainforest habitat. The wilderness or mountains may lack the specific vegetation necessary for marmosets to feed and survive, while swamps may be too wet and have a different array of flora and fauna. Burrows, on the other hand, may provide some protection but do not offer the arboreal lifestyle that marmosets are adapted for. Therefore, the best answer is B.

On 19 March 1286, however, Alexander died after falling from his horse. The heir to the throne was Alexander's granddaughter, Margaret, Maid of Norway. As she was still a child and in Norway, the Scottish lords set up a government of guardians. Margaret fell ill on the voyage to Scotland and died in Orkney on 26 September 1290. The lack of a clear heir led to a period known as the \\"Great Cause\\", with several families laying claim to the throne. With Scotland threatening to descend into civil war, King Edward I of England was invited in by the Scottish nobility to arbitrate. Before the process could begin, he insisted that all of the contenders recognise him as Lord Paramount of Scotland. In early November 1292, at a great feudal court held in the castle at Berwick-upon-Tweed, judgement was given in favour of John Balliol having the strongest claim in law. Edward proceeded to reverse the rulings of the Scottish Lords and even summoned King John Balliol to stand before the English court as a common plaintiff. John was a weak king, known as \\"Toom Tabard\\" or \\"Empty Coat\\". John renounced his homage in March 1296 and by the end of the month Edward stormed Berwick-upon-Tweed, sacking the then-Scottish border town. In April, the Scots were defeated at the Battle of Dunbar in East Lothian and by July, Edward had forced John to abdicate. Edward then instructed his officers to receive formal homage from some 1,800 Scottish nobles .

Along the way, Yuna discovers her own unique style and becomes an unexpected force for change in this male-dominated world. Act 1: Yuna, a socially awkward photographer living in a bustling city, is struggling to find her true photographic niche. One day, she accompanies her close friend, Elise, to a photography meet-up, where she hopes to showcase her latest work. When at the meet-up, she inadvertently captures a \\"panty shot\\" of a cosplayer when adjusting her camera. As she starts to delete the picture, a mysterious figure named Vincent approaches her, impressed by her \\"skill\\" and inviting her to a secretive photography group. Curious and feeling out of place in the regular photography scene, Yuna reluctantly agrees. She is intrigued by the idea and secretly follows Vincent to the next meeting. Act 2: Yuna discovers an underground network of salacious photographers, including many well-known professionals, who specialize in capturing panty shots of unsuspecting women. Initially repulsed, Yuna decides to use this opportunity to take them down from the inside. She creates a disguise and a new persona – Yuri, a brazen and unapologetic panty shot photographer – and joins the group. She quickly befriends several members of the group and learns about a prestigious competition, \\"The Crystal Lens,\\" awarded to the best panty shot photographer. Yuna, driven by the unjust nature of the group, sets her sights on exposing the group by winning the competition and revealing its members to the public. Act 3: As Yuna immerses herself deeper into this hidden world, she discovers that many of the photographers are not only motivated by their perverse desires but also by a twisted sense of camaraderie and belonging. Through her interactions with them, Yuna learns more about what it means to be passionate about one's art and begins questioning her own motivations. Meanwhile, Elise notices a change in Yuna's behavior and grows increasingly concerned about her friend's sudden fascination with \\"panty shots.\\" Elise attempts to confront Yuna about her newfound obsession, but Yuna deflects her concern and keeps her undercover operation a secret. Act 4: The competition finally arrives, and Yuna's unique and artistic panty shots quickly put her among the top contenders. At the final round, as she is about to make her grand reveal and expose the group, Yuna hesitates, realizing that some of the members are genuinely talented individuals who have simply lost their way. Instead of revealing her identity, she dedicates her winning entry to challenging the underground group to reimagine their skills for good rather than objectification. Her powerful words, combined with her undeniable talent, inspire many of the photographers to change their ways and use their skills for more positive and inclusive purposes. Vincent, after gracefully admitting defeat, privately confesses to Yuna that he too has long desired change and offers to join her in this new path. Act 5: The underground group disbands, and several of its members continue on to create a more positive and socially responsible photography collective. Yuna, having finally found her photographic niche, steps into the limelight with her artistic portrayal of empowering and body-positive photography. Elise, although worried about Yuna's initial secret, is proud to see her friend become a positive influence within the photography community. Astonished to see her friend's sudden transformation, Elise remains a loyal confidant, always ready to support Yuna in her future endeavors. Together, Yuna, Vincent, Elise, and other like-minded photographers build a new photography community based on respect, empowerment, and artistic evolution, helping to change the perception of photography in society. \\"Undercover Lenses\\" highlights the importance of staying true to one's values, breaking away from societal constraints, and using one's talents to promote positive change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Phonology is a branch of linguistics concerned with the systematic organization of sounds in languages. It has traditionally focused largely on the study of the systems of phonemes in particular languages (and therefore used to be also called phonemics, or phonematics), but it may also cover any linguistic analysis either at a level beneath the word (including syllable, onset and rime, articulatory gestures, articulatory features, mora, etc.) or at all levels of language where sound is considered to be structured for conveying linguistic meaning. Phonology also includes the study of equivalent organizational systems in sign languages. The word phonology (as in the phonology of English) can also refer to the phonological system (sound system) of a given language. This is one of the fundamental systems which a language is considered to comprise, like its syntax and its vocabulary. Phonology is often distinguished from phonetics. While phonetics concerns the physical production, acoustic transmission and perception of the sounds of speech, phonology describes the way sounds function within a given language or across languages to encode meaning. For many linguists, phonetics belongs to descriptive linguistics, and phonology to theoretical linguistics, although establishing the phonological system of a language is necessarily an application of theoretical principles to analysis of phonetic evidence. Note that this distinction was not always made, particularly before the development of the modern concept of the phoneme in the mid 20th century.

Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts, information, descriptions, or skills, which is acquired through experience or education by perceiving, discovering, or learning. Knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. It can be implicit (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding of a subject); it can be more or less formal or systematic. In philosophy, the study of knowledge is called epistemology; the philosopher Plato famously defined knowledge as \\"justified true belief\\", though this definition is now thought by some analytic philosophers to be problematic because of the Gettier problems while others defend the platonic definition. However, several definitions of knowledge and theories to explain it exist. Knowledge acquisition involves complex cognitive processes: perception, communication, and reasoning; while knowledge is also said to be related to the capacity of \\"acknowledgment\\" in human beings. The definition of knowledge is a matter of ongoing debate among philosophers in the field of epistemology. The classical definition, described but not ultimately endorsed by Plato, specifies that a statement must meet three in order to be considered knowledge: it must be justified, true, and believed. Some claim that these conditions are not sufficient, as Gettier case examples allegedly demonstrate. There are a number of alternatives proposed, including Robert Nozick's arguments for a requirement that knowledge 'tracks the truth' and Simon Blackburn's additional requirement that we do not want to say that those who meet any of these conditions 'through a defect, flaw, or failure' have knowledge. Richard Kirkham suggests that our definition of knowledge requires that the evidence for the belief necessitates its truth. 1. Who said knowledge is justified true belief? 2. Do recent philosophers agree? 3. Why do some disagree? 4. How is knowledge obtained? 5. Is it implicit or explicit? 6. What does it mean to be implicit? 7. And explicit? 8. What term is used for the study of knowledge? 9. How many processes are involved with acquiring knowledge? 10. Are these simple processes? 11. Would communicating be one of them? 12. Is there much disagreement about the definition of knowledge? 13. In the classical sense, how many things must be true for something to be considered knowledge? 14. What are those? 15. Who described this definition? 16. Did he agree with the premise? 17. What do some philosophers claim? 18. What showed that that is likely the case? 19.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Bernoulli’s law explains how the wings of both airplanes and birds create lift that allows flight (see Figure below ). The shape of the wings causes air to flow more quickly — and air pressure to be lower — above the wings than below them. This allows the wings to lift the plane or bird above the ground against the pull of gravity. A spoiler on a race car, like the one in Figure below , works in the opposite way. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly — and air pressure to be greater — above the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, giving its wheels better traction on the track. Now, I have a new situation: Rob is experimenting with how air pressure works. To that end, he has designed two tests. In the first test the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing. He labels it as case A. In the second test the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. He labels it as case B. He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations.

If a magnet sticks well to the sole of the pan, it will work on an induction cooking surface. An \`\`all-metal'' cooker will work with non-ferrous cookware, but available models are limited. Is this statement correct \\"does cast iron work on an induction cooktop\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"does cast iron work on an induction cooktop?\\" is correct. Cast iron pans and cookware are highly compatible with induction cooktops due to their high ferrous metal content, which is essential for the cookware to work effectively on an induction cooking surface. Induction cooking uses electromagnetic fields to generate heat directly within the cookware, rather than relying on the heat transfer from the cooktop to the pan, as in conventional gas or electric cooking methods. The process requires the cookware to have magnetic properties, as the magnetic field created by the induction cooktop causes the ferromagnetic materials in the cookware to heat up. Cast iron, being a ferromagnetic material, is a perfect fit for induction cooktops. Not only does cast iron work on induction cooktops, but it also offers some benefits when compared to other cookware materials. These benefits include: 1. Cast iron cookware has excellent heat retention properties, which allows the cookware to hold onto heat longer than other materials, leading to more even cooking temperatures. 2. The high heat capacity of cast iron cookware allows it to reach and maintain high temperatures, which is useful for searing, frying, and other high-temperature cooking techniques. 3. Cast iron cookware is highly resilient and can last for generations if properly cared for, making it a sustainable and environmentally friendly choice. However, when using cast iron cookware on an induction cooktop, some precautions should be taken. For instance: 1. Make sure your cast iron cookware has a flat base so that it sits well on the induction cooktop and ensures optimal heat transfer. 2. Be careful when placing or moving your cast iron cookware on the surface of your induction cooktop, as they might scratch or damage the surface due to their weight and rough texture. Using trivets or placing silicone mats under your cookware can help prevent this problem. 3. It's essential to keep your cast iron cookware properly seasoned, as this can help prevent food from sticking to the pan, and also imparts a unique flavor to your dishes. In conclusion, cast iron cookware is highly compatible with induction cooktops due to its ferromagnetic properties and unlocks numerous benefits when used for cooking. So, the statement \\"does cast iron work on an induction cooktop?\\" is accurate and reflects the compatibility between cast iron cookware and induction cooking technology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he urged North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to directly engage with Washington to salvage the June 12 nuclear summit with the U.S., when the two leaders held a surprise second inter-Korean summit Saturday. “I emphasized that the two sides must directly communicate in order to eradicate any misunderstandings, and preliminary talks through working-level negotiations on key agendas are necessary,” said President Moon at a press briefing in Seoul Sunday. North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met. Moon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On Saturday Moon said Kim reaffirmed his commitment to end his country’s nuclear weapons program, but shared his key concern that the U.S. would work to destabilize his rule despite any security guarantees it offers. “What is uncertain for Chairman Kim Jong Un is not his willingness for denuclearization, but he has concerns over whether North Korea can trust the fact that Washington will end its hostile relations, and guarantee the security...

Women teachers have been 'strongly suggested' to remove their veils when teaching in the classroom in the majority Catholic country of the Philippines. It is the latest twist in the ongoing controversy over the wearing of the religious garment, that sparked a riot in the French capital Paris on Friday. An order was sent out by the Filipino Government yesterday instructing females who teach Arabic language and Islamic values to take off the religious niqab, which covers all of the face except the eyes. The Government believes this will lead to better relationships between teachers and pupils. Education secretary Armin Luistro said it was part of reforms designed to make schools more sensitive to religion. The ruling does not apply to the hijab - garments that cover the head only. Muslim schoolgirls will still be allowed to wear the veil in schools as well as 'appropriate clothing' in gym class. But while female Muslim schoolteachers can wear the veil outside class, they have been told to remove the veil during lessons so they can interact better with students. The order stated: 'Once the teacher is in the classroom, she is requested to remove the veil.' It added the move would help aid 'proper identification of the teachers by their pupils, thus promoting better teacher-pupil relationship'. It would also help the teaching of languages, where 'lip formation' plays a role in pronouncing certain letters. The Government’s Office of Muslim Affairs said it agreed with the education department’s measures, although it had not yet received a copy of the order. Roque Morales, an adviser to the office, claimed that while he did not know how many Muslim Filipinas were working as teachers, the practice of wearing veils, such as hijabs and niqabs, was widespread in the southern Philippines. Breaking down barriers: Education Secretary Armin Luistro believes the ban on the veil will lead to better relationships between teachers and pupils. Exempt: Schoolgirls, like this one, will continue to be allowed to wear veils around schools, but their teachers will have to remove full face niqabs similar to this one on the left. He said: 'You would almost see it everywhere.' So far there have not been any complaints from Muslim teachers, he added. The office said that Muslims make up about 15 per cent of the Philippine population, mostly based in the southern regions, which they consider their ancestral home. The hijab and niqab - a religious garment worn by some Muslim women to cover their whole face - continue to divide cultures around the world. Two years ago, France banned the niqab and the burqa from being worn anywhere in public in a move that sparked protests among Muslims. Protests: Muslims took to the streets when France banned the niqab and burqa from being worn in public places. On Friday rioting broke out in the Paris suburb of Trappes after police carried out identity checks on a Muslim woman who was wearing a full face veil, according to the Guardian. Her husband was arrested and taken into custody amid allegations he had assaulted one of the officers involved. Hundreds of people took to the streets, hurling stones and paving slabs and setting fire to cars, bins and bus shelters, demanding his release. Riot police tackled them with tear gas. The police station was said to have been under siege for about an hour. A second night of rioting followed on Saturday, when violence threatened to spread to nearby towns. The Collective Against Islamophobia in France released a statement. complaining of heavy handed policing. In 2004 France introduced a law banning state employees from wearing prominent religious symbols, such as Christian crosses and Jewish skullcaps, as well as Muslim veils.

Write highlights for this article: Lighting storms are impressive displays of nature's power - but up until now scientists hadn’t realised that they could also sculpt mountains. A team of researchers from Johannesburg recently discovered that a single lightning bolt could, for example, blow. three to 10 cubic metres (100 to 350 cubic feet) out of bedrock. This. goes against the current assumptions that the peaks above 3,050 metres. (10,000ft) tend to break down over hundreds of thousands of years. Lighting storms are impressive displays of nature's power - but up until now scientists hadn't realised that they could also sculpt mountains. The discovery was made by Professor Stefan Grab while studying the Drakensberg mountains in Lesotho, southern Africa. Previous theories claim that water melting and freezing inside cracks causes the rocks on mountains to break into pieces as they expand and break off. The Wind River Range, the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains were thought to have been shaped in this way, for example. But unlike these formations, Professor. Grab believes that lightning was the main cause behind the creation of. the mountain landscapes in southern Africa. In Lesotho's Drakensberg mountains, for instance, the team found that a single lightning bolt could blow three to 10 cubic metres (100 to 350 cubic feet) out of bedrock. New research done on the Drakensberg mountains in South Africa debunks previous suggestions that cold temperatures played a dominate role in mountain formation. The hit: Lighning strickes the rock surface. The heat - which is around 27760 ºC - vapourises water that is stored in the cracks. The explosion: The force of the vapourised water explosed the rocke, moving 10 tonnes of debris as far as 10 metres (30 feet) away. New cracks help to continue the process of weathering. In Lesotho's Drakensberg mountains, for instance, the team found that a single lightning bolt could blow three to 10 cubic metres (100 to 350 cubic feet) out of bedrock. This goes against the current assumptions that the peaks above 3,050 metres (10,000 feet) tend to break down over hundreds of thousands of years. His team used a compass to prove their theory. ‘A compass needle always points to magnetic north,’ said Professor Grab's colleague Professor Jasper Knight. ‘But. when you pass a compass over a land’s surface, if the minerals in the. rock have a strong enough magnetic field, the compass will read the. magnetic field of the rock, which corresponds to when it was formed. ‘In the Drakensburg, there are a lot of basalt rocks which contain a lot of magnetic minerals, so they’ve got a very strong magnetic signal.’ If a compass is passed over an area where a lightning strike occurred, its needle will suddenly swing through 360 degrees. ‘The energy of the lightning hitting the land’s surface can, for a short time, partially melt the rock and when the rock cools down again,’ added. ‘It takes on the magnetic imprint of today’s magnetic field, not the magnetic field of millions of years ago when the rock was originally formed.’ Because of the movement of continents, magnetic north for the newly formed rock will be different from that of the older rock around it. Professor Knight and Professor Grab mapped out the distribution of lightning strikes in the Drakensburg and discovered that lightning significantly controls the evolution of the mountain landscapes because it helps to shape the summit areas with this blasting effect. Previously, angular debris was assumed to have been created by changes typical of cold, glacial environments, such as fracturing due to frost. Water enters cracks in rocks and when it freezes, it expands, causing the rocks to split apart. ‘Many. people have considered mountains to be pretty passive agents, just. sitting there to be affected by cold climates over these long periods of. time,’ said Professor Knight. ‘This. evidence suggests that that is completely wrong. African mountain. landscapes sometimes evolve very quickly and very dramatically over. short periods of time. These are actually very sensitive environments. and we need to know more about them.’ Previously, angular debris was assumed to have been created by changes typical of cold, glacial environments, such as fracturing due to frost. The research team also attempted to quantify how much debris was moved by such blasts, which can cause boulders weighing several tonnes to move tens of metres. The stability of the land’s surface has important implications for the people living near the mountains. ‘If we have lots of debris being generated it’s going to flow down slope and this is associated with hazards such as landslides,’ said Professor Knight. Mountains are also inextricably linked to food security and water supply. In Lesotho, a country crucial to South Africa’s water supply, food shortages are leading to overgrazing, exposing the rock surface and making mountain landscapes even more vulnerable to weathering by lightning. Professor Knight hopes the research will help to put in place monitoring and mitigation to try and counteract some of the effects. ‘The more we increase our understanding, the more we are able to do something about it,’ he said.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the band who played Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio? ? Following a life-threatening drug addiction that developed after leaving the Chili Peppers in 1992, Frusciante completed a month of drug rehabilitation at Las Encinas in Pasadena in 1998. Shortly thereafter he was asked to rejoin the band. After several months of writing and recording, the Chili Peppers' next album, Californication was released. The album went on to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide, becoming the Chili Peppers' most successful recording to date. Frusciante's return generated much response from critics, who recognized the album as a commercial revitalization from their previous record, One Hot Minute. A two-year-long, international tour followed, which included several festival appearances, including Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio. The writing and formation of By the Way began immediately following the culmination of Californication's world tour, in the spring of 2001. As with Californication, much of the creation took place in the band members' homes and other practice locations, such as a recording studio stage. Kiedis recalled of the situation: \\"We started finding some magic and some music and some riffs and some rhythms and some jams and some grooves, and we added to it and subtracted from it and pushed it around and put melodies to it.\\" Frusciante and Kiedis would collaborate for days straight, discussing guitar progressions and sharing lyrics. For Kiedis, \\"writing By the Way...was a whole different experience from Californication.

You can use a crock lid designed for this purpose or stretch a cloth or t-shirt over the opening and secure it in place with a large rubber band. Place the covered crock in a warm area with a temperature around 70 degrees overnight. Putting the crock in a cool place won't facilitate the growth of the yeast. Storing it in a place that's too warm will kill the yeast. Find a good in-between place in your kitchen. The day after you make the mixture, uncover it and stir it thoroughly, and recover. Do this every 4 hours or so the first day, then keep stirring a few times per day for the next 3 days. The mixture should start bubbling as the yeast moves into action. This is the fermentation process that will lead to delicious wine. When the bubbling slows down, about 3 days after it begins, it's time to strain out the solids and siphon the liquid into your carboy for longer-term storage. Once you've siphoned it into the carboy, affix the airlock to the opening to allow for the release of gas while preventing oxygen from coming in and spoiling your wine. If you don't have an airlock, you can use a small balloon placed over the opening with about 5 pin sized holes in it. Secure it with tape. This will let the gas escape but not let in oxygen. It's better if you can let it age for up to nine, during which time the wine will age and mellow, resulting in a much improved taste. If you used extra honey in your wine, it's better to age it on the longer side, or else it will taste too sweet when you drink it. To prevent the wine from catching a bacteria that could cause it to turn to vinegar, add a Campden tablet to the mixture as soon as you remove the airlock. Siphon the wine into your clean bottles, filling them almost to the top, and cork them immediately. Allow the wine to further age in the bottles or enjoy it immediately. Use dark bottles to preserve the color of red wines.

Given the question: Information: - Delain is a Dutch symphonic metal band formed in 2002 by former Within Temptation keyboardist Martijn Westerholt, and Charlotte Wessels. The name of the band comes from the Kingdom of Delain in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\". - Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the \\"gothic\\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album \\"Enter\\", was mostly gothic metal. \\"Enter\\" even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \\"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\\". - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Nightwish is a symphonic power metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, \\"Angels Fall First\\" (1997). In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. - Vanishing Point are a progressive / symphonic metal band based in Melbourne , Australia . After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'vanishing point ' with the relationship of 'inception'.

Over the centuries, Weimar remained a small town of less than 5,000 inhabitants. When it became the capital of Saxe-Weimar in 1572, population growth was stimulated and population increased from 3,000 in 1650 to 6,000 in 1750. Around the year 1800, Weimar had 7,000 inhabitants. Their number grew constantly over the years to 13,000 in 1850, 28,000 in 1900 and 35,000 at the beginning of World War I. During the interwar period, the new capital of Thuringia saw a population boom, which led to 65,000 inhabitants in 1940. Since that time, the population levels have stagnated. The years 2009 to 2012 brought a moderate growth of approximately 0.35% p. a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Weimar. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders. Answer this question based on the article: How many more people did Weimar have in 1800 than they had in 1750?","completion":"To find out how many more people Weimar had in 1800 than in 1750, we need to look at the given population numbers for these years. In 1800, Weimar had 7,000 inhabitants. In 1750, Weimar had 6,000 inhabitants. Now we can calculate the difference in population between these two years: 7,000 inhabitants (in 1800) - 6,000 inhabitants (in 1750) = 1,000 inhabitants So, Weimar had 1,000 more people in 1800 than they had in 1750."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As a young journalist, Bahadur was determined to break into the field of international journalism and distinguish himself from his peers. Motivated by his passion for discovery and his desire to present unexplored stories to the world, Jay Bahadur focused his journalistic efforts on Somalia. At the time, Somalia was plagued by rampant piracy along its coasts, which posed a significant threat to international shipping channels. This prompted him to delve deeply into the world of Somali pirates and document their activities for the wider world to understand. In 2008, Bahadur embarked on a daring journey to the semi-autonomous Puntland region in northeastern Somalia, where he spent three months interviewing various pirates, their families, and local officials. His goal was to investigate the motives behind piracy, the pirates' organizational structure, and the socioeconomic and political factors that contributed to the rise of piracy in the region. In 2011, Bahadur published \\"The Pirates of Somalia: Inside Their Hidden World,\\" which became an instant success and catapulted him into the global spotlight. The book provides an intriguing and comprehensive account of his experiences infiltrating the dangerous world of Somali pirates. It explores their motivations, internal dynamics, and operational tactics, as well as the international response to this maritime menace. Aside from highlighting the inner workings of the pirate world, \\"The Pirates of Somalia\\" also exposes the complex interplay between the pirates and the international community. It examines the failures of various governments and organizations to tackle the piracy problem effectively, and shows how it is tied to a web of political, economic, and social issues both within Somalia and beyond. Jay Bahadur's work on \\"The Pirates of Somalia\\" earned him accolades and respect in the field of journalism. It has been translated into numerous languages and draws attention to the critical issue of maritime security. As a groundbreaking exposé, Bahadur's book has undoubtedly contributed greatly to our understanding of modern piracy and the conditions in which it flourishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

CHAPTER III. FACE TO FACE. When Eustace Le Neve returned to lunch at Penmorgan that day he was silent to his host about Trevennack of Trevennack. To say the truth, he was so much attracted by Miss Cleer's appearance that he didn't feel inclined to mention having met her. But he wanted to meet her again for all that, and hoped he would do so. Perhaps Tyrrel might know the family, and ask them round to dine some night. At any rate, society is rare at the Lizard. Sooner or later, he felt sure, he'd knock up against the mysterious stranger somewhere. And that involved the probability of knocking up against the mysterious stranger's beautiful daughter. Next morning after breakfast, however, he made a vigorous effort to induce Walter Tyrrel to mount the cliff and look at the view from Penmorgan Point toward the Rill and Kynance. It was absurd, he said truly, for the proprietor of such an estate never to have seen the most beautiful spot in it. But Tyrrel was obdurate. On the point of actually mounting the cliff itself he wouldn't yield one jot or tittle. Only, after much persuasion, he consented at last to cross the headland by the fields at the back and come out at the tor above St. Michael's Crag, provided always Eustace would promise he'd neither go near the edge himself nor try to induce his friend to approach it. Satisfied with this lame compromise--for he really wished his host to enjoy that glorious view--Eustace Le Neve turned up the valley behind the house, with Walter Tyrrel by his side, and after traversing several fields, through gaps in the stone walls, led out his companion at last to the tor on the headland. 1. who wanted Walter Tyrrel to mount the cliff? 2. what could be seen from there? 3. had the proprietor of the estate ever been there? 4. who was the proprietor of the estate? 5. who was Eustace attracted to? 6. did he want to meet her again? 7. what is rare at the Lizard? 8. did Tyrrel want to go up the cliff? 9. did he yield at all on that topic? 10. how so? 11. did he have any conditions? 12. what did Eustace think of the comprimise? 13. did he think it was lame? 14. what did they traverse together? 15. what did they go through?","completion":"1.

By the middle of the 7th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline . By the middle of the 7th century , alchemy was an almost mystical discipline . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"Yes, both of these sentences essentially convey the same meaning, but there are slight differences in emphasis and structure. The primary message of both sentences is that by the middle of the 7th century, alchemy had transformed into a discipline that was heavily influenced by mysticism. In the first sentence, the inclusion of the word \\"almost\\" before \\"entirely\\" adds a slight emphasis to the extent to which alchemy had become mystical. It implies that while alchemy was not completely a mystical discipline, it was very close to being so. In the second sentence, the word \\"almost\\" comes before \\"mystical discipline,\\" which softens the emphasis on how mystical alchemy was. In this case, the focus is more on the fact that alchemy had come close to becoming a mystical discipline. Structurally, the two sentences are inverted, with the descriptive phrase coming earlier in the first sentence and later in the second sentence. This subtle difference does not change the overall meaning, but it may impact readers' perception of which aspect of the sentence is more important – the timeline (middle of the 7th century) or the nature of alchemy (mystical discipline). In conclusion, while the sentences both convey the same fundamental meaning, their differences in emphasis and structure may impact the reader's perception slightly. Overall, though, a reader is likely to understand both sentences as conveying the same core message: by the middle of the 7th century, alchemy had become very much a mystical discipline."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now wreck divers are hoping to find the lost USAF C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and uncover the truth behind what must be Meyer's last night on Earth, LiveScience reports. According to military reports, Meyer desperately missed his wife back home in Virginia while stationed at an air base in England.

He desperately missed his wife, who was in Virginia, and his longing to see her led him to make a fateful decision. On May 23, 1969, after heavy drinking, Meyer posed as a captain to gain control of a USAF C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. Though he was only licensed for a small single-engine plane, he managed to take off successfully with the large cargo plane. During the flight, Meyer contacted his wife, who later reported the call to the Air Force Times. However, Sgt. Meyer also radioed the base about flight problems he was experiencing. Then, he disappeared from radar approximately 200 miles away over the English Channel. Eyewitnesses claim that the plane exploded upon impact with the water. The official military account offers no explanation for the crash, and Meyer's body was never recovered, leaving his fate shrouded in mystery. Nearly 50 years later, a group of wreck divers known as Deeper Dorset is hoping to find the lost C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and uncover the truth behind Meyer's last night. Simon Brown, a member of the diving group, spoke to the BBC about Meyer's last flight: \\"He did a fantastic job to get a complex plane off the runway. Whether he flew into [a] cloud and got disoriented or was shot down, we're not discounting anything.\\" To fund their search effort, Deeper Dorset has launched a Kickstarter page. The group plans to use 3D photogrammetry technology to locate the C-130 in an area that is likely filled with numerous lost ships and WWII planes.

He said Russia was either incompetent or inattentive in its failure to secure and destroy Mr. Assad’s chemical weapons stockpiles. “But this distinction doesn’t much matter to the dead,” Mr. Tillerson said. “We can’t let this happen again.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story At the Pentagon, several officials said the presence of Russian personnel at the Al Shayrat airfield, used to launch the chemical strike, points to at least a possibility that Russia knew about the chemical attack. But Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Tuesday refused to make that direct accusation. “It was very clear that the Assad regime planned it, orchestrated it and executed it,” Mr. Mattis said at a news conference, when asked whether Russia was involved. “We know what I’ve just told you. We don’t know anything beyond that.” The Holes in Russia’s Account of the Syria Chemical Attack The available evidence contradicts much of what the Russian government has said about a toxic attack that killed more than 100 people. Mr. Mattis also declined to confirm reports that a Russian drone was flying over a hospital treating victims of the chemical attack last week, in advance of the hospital being bombed. While several United States officials have suggested privately that the hospital was targeted in an effort to hide evidence of the chemical attack, Mr. Mattis appeared to be taking pains at Tuesday’s news conference to point his finger solely at Syria, at least for now. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “We have gone back through and looked at all the evidence,” Mr. Mattis said. “It is very clear who planned the attack, who authorized it and who executed it. There is no doubt at all.” The Trump administration’s dossier appeared to suggest a broader effort to generate international consensus for a forceful response to the Syrian government’s actions. White House officials said they were eagerly awaiting action by the United Nations and the results of a fact-finding mission by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the international body charged with enforcing the global chemical weapons ban.

A verbal confrontation with Russia is likely, and possibly a veto. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Much of the White House report was devoted to rebutting Russia’s claim that the chemical attack last week, which it said killed as many as 100 people, including “many children,” was actually the result of a Syrian airstrike against a terrorist depot in the town of Khan Sheikhoun that contained chemical weapons. The report cited a video and commercial satellite imagery that showed that the chemical weapon had landed in the middle of a road, not at a weapons facility. White House officials also said American intelligence agencies did not believe that the Islamic State or other terrorist groups had sarin gas. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The report also rejected Moscow’s claim that the attack was a “prank of a provocative nature” and denied Russian suggestions that the substance used might not have been sarin. “Victims of the attack on April 4 displayed telltale symptoms of nerve agent exposure, including pinpoint pupils, foaming at the nose and mouth, and twitching,” the report said. On Tuesday, Mr. Putin repeated his claim that opposition forces had essentially tried to frame the Syrian government by placing chemical weapons in civilian areas and blaming Mr. Assad’s forces. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “We have information from various sources that similar provocations — and I have no other word for that — are being prepared in other regions of Syria, including southern suburbs of Damascus, where they intend to plant certain substance again and accuse official Syrian authorities of using it,” Mr. Putin said. But White House officials said antigovernment forces could not have fabricated the volume of evidence that points to the Assad regime’s responsibility. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In seeking to rebut Russia’s claim, the report went into detail about the carnage last week. It said social media reports placed the start of the attack at 6:55 a.m. in Khan Sheikhoun, in Idlib Province. The United States’ assessment is that Su-22 bombers took off from the Al Shayrat airfield and delivered the chemical agent. It also asserts that “personnel historically associated with Syria’s chemical weapons program” had been at the airfield in late March preparing for an attack, and on the day it was carried out. ||||| WASHINGTON—Russia has been carrying out a “disinformation campaign” to try to cover up for the suspected Syrian chemical attack last week, senior White House officials said Tuesday, adding the U.S. has concluded the Syrian military used banned sarin gas in the assault.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the names of the two military high schools? ? In 2007, there were about 4,350 schools, about half of which were primary schools; on average, each school had 688 students. In recent years, Istanbul's educational system has expanded substantially; from 2000 to 2007, the number of classrooms and teachers nearly doubled and the number of students increased by more than 60 percent. Galatasaray High School, established in 1481 as the Galata Palace Imperial School, is the oldest high school in Istanbul and the second-oldest educational institution in the city. It was built at the behest of Sultan Bayezid II, who sought to bring students with diverse backgrounds together as a means of strengthening his growing empire. It is one of Turkey's Anatolian High Schools, elite public high schools that place a stronger emphasis on instruction in foreign languages. Galatasaray, for example, offers instruction in French; other Anatolian High Schools primarily teach in English or German alongside Turkish. The city also has foreign high schools, such as Liceo Italiano, that were established in the 19th century to educate foreigners.Kuleli Military High School, along the shores of the Bosphorus in Çengelköy, and Turkish Naval High School, on one of the Princes' Islands, were military high schools, complemented by three military academies—the Turkish Air Force, Turkish Military, and Turkish Naval Academies. Both schools were shut Darüşşafaka High School provides free education to children across the country missing at least one parent. Darüşşafaka begins instruction with the fourth grade, providing instruction in English and, starting in sixth grade, a second foreign language—German or French.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information: - The Emesinae, or thread-legged bugs, are a subfamily of the Reduviidae (i.e., assassin bugs). They are conspicuously different from the other reduviids by their very slender body form. They are stalking, predatory insects that can be collected on palm fronds, cliffs, spider webbing, or near lights at night (many can be collected by blacklight). They walk on their mid and hind legs; the front pair is raptorial. Some groups specialize on spiders. Very little is known about emesines except that many species are found in the tropics. Pedro Wygodzinsky wrote the most recent revision of this group. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Pseudometapterus is a little - known genus of thread - legged bug in the subfamily Emesinae . Members of the genus occur in North America and usually have wings that are extremely small or absent entirely , though a winged form of P. umbrosus is known from Southern Illinois . - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - The Reduviidae are a large cosmopolitan family of the order Hemiptera (true bugs). They are slightly unusual overall, but very common among the Hemiptera because almost all are terrestrial ambush predators (most other predatory Hemiptera are aquatic). The main examples of nonpredatory Reduviidae are some blood-sucking ectoparasites in the subfamily Triatominae. Though spectacular exceptions are known, most members of the family are fairly easily recognizable; they have a relatively narrow neck, sturdy build, and formidable curved proboscis (sometimes called a rostrum). Large specimens should be handled with caution, if at all, because they sometimes defend themselves with a very painful stab from the proboscis. - The tropics are a region of the Earth surrounding the equator. They are delimited in latitude by the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere at N and the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere at S; these latitudes correspond to the axial tilt of the Earth. The tropics are also referred to as the tropical zone and the torrid zone (see geographical zone). The tropics include all the areas on the Earth where the Sun is at a point directly overhead at least once during the solar year (which is a subsolar point). - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - The term raptorial implies much the same as \\"predatory\\", but most often refers to modifications of an arthropod's foreleg that make it function for the grasping of prey while it is consumed, where the gripping surfaces are formed from the opposing faces of two successive leg segments (see illustration). This is distinctly different from the grasping mechanism of a structure such as a scorpion's claw (a \\"chela\\") in which one of the opposing surfaces is an articulated digit, and not a leg segment. While this is most widely known in mantises, similarly modified legs can be found in some crustaceans (e.g., mantis shrimp), and various insect families, such as Mantispidae, Belostomatidae, Nepidae, and Naucoridae (all members of these groups have raptorial forelegs).

Birds singing. Leaves rustling. The waters of the pool shining, shimmering in the sunlight. I was sitting on the steps of the pool, my legs submerged in water.Those blue depths were irrestisible. I inched a bit further in. Water to my waist… a little more…. closer to the blue…..just a little more…water to my chest… yes, keep going…a bit more…water to my neck….almost there….the blue gaze of those depths held me in awe…oh my..so beaut- — Going up a sort of endless escalator. I can't see very well what's in front of me. It's all very dark. I can sense someone behind me, but I dare not look back. For some reason I cannot see my feet. In fact, I cannot see any of me at all. It feels very strange and …well,creepy! I want to whistle, to kinda comfort myself, but it feels like I've lost the ability to speak. My mind just doesn't know how to carry out this desire to speak. It feels unnatural….. That someone behind me pokes me in my(invisible) back. Its'(his/her?) touch is strangely warm, then icy. I still don't look back….yes, that's the key, don't look back. It's a test. Just don't look back and you'll- — Snap! Back into the pool, panting. Everything is blurry. There are people gathered around the pool, screaming. A hand extends toward me. I reach for it…. — Well, I'd love to tell you what happened after that, but the thing is, I don't even know myself. For just at that precise moment, my wretched alarm decided to beep-beep. And I never got to see the ending! — Wait, did you mean “went to the other side” in reality? Don't be ridiculous! Question: When the alarm went off, how did they probably feel? Answer: Answer:","completion":"When the alarm went off, they probably felt a mixture of emotions. Some of the emotions they may have experienced include frustration, confusion, relief, and curiosity. Frustration, because they were abruptly pulled out of an immersive and captivating experience just before finding out what would happen next. The alarm interrupted the story at a crucial moment, and they were unable to see its conclusion. Confusion, as they transitioned from the dream world to reality, they had to process the sudden shift in their environment and make sense of the situation. Their mind was likely still caught up in the dream, which could have left them momentarily disoriented. Relief, since they were in a somewhat uncomfortable and creepy situation in the dream where they were going up the endless escalator and being poked by an unknown figure. Waking up from that experience may have provided a sense of security as they returned to the familiarity of their real surroundings. Lastly, curiosity, because they were likely eager to know the ending of the dream and understand the significance of the events that took place. Their mind may have been filled with questions about what could have happened, and they might have been left with a desire to explore the dream further if given the chance. Overall, the experience of being pulled out of an intense and intriguing dream by an alarm can elicit a wide range of dynamic emotions, spanning from frustration to curiosity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who wrote an autobiography in 1936? ? Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F. Kelly, in his history of the Rite... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Stravinsky.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

The comments by Shao Qiwei, director of China's State Administration of Tourism, came a day after Shanghai's mayor Han Zheng said the city was preparing to build China's second Disney theme park. \\"China has a very large population. We now have 1.3 billion people. The market is very large. As far as I know, Hong Kong Disneyland is now very crowded,\\" said Shao, whose comments were broadcast on Hong Kong's Cable TV.

Located in the St. James district of Northampton, Franklins Gardens has undergone several transformations, constantly upgrading its facilities to comply with modern rugby requirements. The stadium can now hold up to 15,249 spectators. A comprehensive redevelopment project was completed in 2016, resulting in a state-of-the-art stadium complex with several attractive features such as the Barwell Stand, which replaced the old Sturtridge Pavilion, the Carlsberg Stand, the Church's Stand, and the Tetley's Stand. Additionally, the stadium encompasses conference and training facilities, making it suitable for hosting various events in addition to rugby matches. Northampton Saints' mascot, Bernie, a delightful Saint Bernard dog, entertains the crowd and brings a jovial atmosphere to match days at Franklins Gardens. The Saints have a strong fan base, affectionately known as the \\"Saints Nation,\\" who passionately support the club and create an electrifying environment during home games at Franklins Gardens.

Summarize this article: The Commerce Department said gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual pace of 1.1% in the quarter, up from an earlier estimate of 0.8%. The upwards revision was helped by stronger export sales. However, growth in consumer spending was revised down to 1.5%, the slowest pace since the first quarter of 2014.

Her Prussophile successor, Peter III, at once recalled Russian armies from Berlin (see: the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1762)) and mediated Frederick's truce with Sweden. He also placed a corps of his own troops under Frederick's command This turn of events has become known as the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg. Frederick was then able to muster a larger army of 120,000 men and concentrate it against Austria. He drove them from much of Saxony, while his brother Henry won a victory in Silesia in the Battle of Freiberg (29 October 1762). At the same time, his Brunswick allies captured the key town of Göttingen and compounded this by taking Cassel. How many troops did Frederick have left?

Let me break down a few of these roles and relate them directly to their duties when deployed with the infantry: 1. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD): The EOD technicians deployed with infantry are responsible for locating, identifying, and safely disposing of any hazardous or unexploded ordnance, as well as improvised explosive devices, to protect the lives of the infantry members and ensure the mission's success. 2. Pararescue: When deployed with infantry, pararescuemen often provide crucial medical support, including advanced life-saving care, and are responsible for extracting and recovering injured personnel in combat or hazardous environments. 3. Security Forces: Security Forces personnel are responsible for defending and protecting USAF bases, equipment, and personnel when deployed with an infantry unit. They can be tasked with ensuring the safety and security of the area, preventing unauthorized access, and conducting patrols. 4. Combat Control: When deployed with the infantry, combat controllers help in coordinating air support and facilitating communication between the infantry and aircraft. They can call in airstrikes, manage air traffic, and guide aircraft to landing zones. 5. Tactical Air Control Party (TACP): TACPs deploy with infantry to serve as the link between ground forces and air assets. They provide close air support, call in air strikes, and give guidance on aerial reconnaissance and surveillance missions.

A:","completion":"To make a cedar oil rub for your furniture, follow these steps: 1. Gather materials: - Cedarwood essential oil (100% pure) - A carrier oil of your choice, such as fractionated coconut oil, sweet almond oil, or jojoba oil - A small mixing bowl - A measuring spoon or dropper - A glass bottle or jar for storage - A clean, soft cloth 2. Determine the desired ratio: First, you'll need to decide how strong you want the cedar oil fragrance to be in your rub. A common ratio is 2% for dilution, which means that you'll use 2 drops of essential oil per teaspoon (roughly 5 ml) of carrier oil. For a stronger scent, you can use a higher concentration of essential oil, but be cautious when applying it to finished or delicate furniture surfaces. 3. Mix cedarwood essential oil and carrier oil: Begin by measuring out the carrier oil into the mixing bowl. You will need approximately 5 ml (1 teaspoon) of carrier oil for every 2 drops of cedarwood oil. For example, if you use 10 ml (2 teaspoons) of carrier oil, then you will need to add 4 drops of cedarwood oil. Add the appropriate number of drops of cedarwood essential oil to the mixing bowl. 4. Combine the oils: Mix the cedarwood essential oil and carrier oil together thoroughly using a spoon. Be sure to blend well to ensure an even distribution of the essential oil throughout the carrier oil. 5. Transfer to storage container: Carefully pour or use a dropper to transfer the cedar oil rub mixture into a glass bottle or jar for storage. Be sure to use a dark-colored glass container to protect the cedar oil rub from sunlight, which can reduce its potency. 6. Label the container: Use a permanent marker or a label to indicate the contents of the jar, including the type of essential oil used (cedarwood) and the date of creation. This will help you keep track of your cedar oil rub's potency and maintain its efficacy. 7. Apply the cedar oil rub: To use your cedar oil rub on your furniture, pour a small amount onto a clean, soft cloth, and gently rub it into the wood surface, following the grain of the wood. Use a clean side of the cloth to buff away any excess oil. Be sure to test the cedar oil rub on a small, inconspicuous area of your furniture first to see how it reacts to the finish or fabric. 8. Store the cedar oil rub: Keep your cedar oil rub in a cool, dark place (like a cabinet or pantry) when not in use to preserve its potency. Make sure the container is sealed tightly to prevent the oils from evaporating. By using this cedar oil rub, you'll not only give your furniture a beautiful, natural sheen, but you'll also impart a pleasant, soothing cedar scent throughout your home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What part of the church did Nikolova consider unsuitable for the baptism?, using the article: The rectangular narthex constitutes the middle part of the building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the lobby of the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.Together with the north and south wall, the entrance of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.Measuring 5 m × 9.50 m (16.4 ft × 31.2 ft), the narthex is the part of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach 3 m (9.8 ft). Its two turrets have a diameter of 3.20 m (10.5 ft); each has an entrance facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret. There are two pairs of columns inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is accessible from the north tower. The columns divide the narthex into three naves and mark the way from the narthex entrance to the gates of the rotunda., what would be the answer ?

Video shows U.S. airpower (MQ-9s) in support,\\" declared a short message accompanying the video, which was posted on the official account of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Subsequent footage showed more Taliban scrambling, in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the airstrikes. The Pentagon footage was released Wednesday, as U.S., NATO and Afghan government forces were locked in a fierce battle with the Taliban for control of the capital of Farah, which borders Iran. The tweet was unusually graphic. While the U.S. military often releases footage of buildings or vehicles being destroyed, it does not as frequently distribute videos that show individuals being bombed.

This detail is related by the film's narrator (the voice of Michael Hordern), who comments ironically on the events that transpire. The widow (Marie Kean), disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to the raising of her son.While still in his teens, Barry falls in love with his older cousin, Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton). A wealthy English army officer named Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) meets and begins courting Nora, leading the jealous Barry to challenge Quin to a duel. They fire pistols at ten paces and Quin falls. Believing that he has killed Quin and will be arrested by the British for murder, Barry flees.On the road to Dublin, Barry is robbed and his horse stolen by a middle-aged highwayman (Arthur O'Sullivan) and the man's son. Penniless, Barry enlists in the British army and finds himself in boot camp. During training, Barry gets into a brawl with a local bully named O'Toole (Pat Roach), and is forced to fight bare-knuckle against the guy. Barry wins the fight by dodging all of O'Toole's blows and knocks out his opponent, which earns him popularity from the rest of his fellow recruits.After basic training, Barry and his unit are sent to France to fight in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) between the alliance of Great Britain and Prussia and the alliance of France, Austria and Russia. While still in a training camp, Barry learns from an old friend, Captain Grogan (Godfrey Quigley), that Captain Quin is not dead after all and has married Nora. The whole duel was a ploy by Nora's relatives to make Barry flee from Ireland so she can marry Quin.After the death of Grogan in a skirmish, Barry, fed up with the brutality of war, deserts from the British army.

So, one night at a party, he hears some ex-roadie tell him a classic bit of rock n' roll lore; the one about how Gram Parsons' corpse was stolen from LAX by his loyal roadie so he could honor Parsons' wishes that he be cremated out in JoshuaTree. Wow! What a great idea for a movie! Rock n' Roll (well, country), grave robbing, escapes, friendship, the 70's! I guess we could get Johnny Knoxville from \\"Jackass\\", cause it's kind of a prank, right, and Knoxville wants to do \\"a movie\\" too. Why he must have thought he had the next \\"Snatch\\" on his hand! But this story's not really that exciting...we need something for Knoxville to struggle against.like a psychotic girlfirend after his money! But Parsons' was married at the time. That's O.K., no one knows that. Besides we could get Christina Applegate. But what if the audience doesn't like the idea of stealing a corpse.well, we'll get his dad to join the chase, but give permission in the end. But Parsons' dad killed himself when he was 10, in fact his orphan status, and tragic childhood, are key parts of the Parsons Mythology. Mythology? We're making \\"A Movie!\\" This is creative problem solving. It's an uncomfortable experience for anybody even vaguely knowledgeable on or interested in the subject. Applegate's presence is doubling jarring. First her invented character is a Beverly Hills bitch before her time -she might as well have walked around the whole movie a cell phone in her hand, and secondly, what kind of man would Parsons be if he ever associated himself with that kind of harpy? Facts aren't just distorted or left out, but REVERSED. They could have easily found the villain they wanted in Parsons STEPfather, who was attempting to whisk the body back to his home state where law would favor him in dividing up the considerable inheritance. And the music, oh, the music I love. The music is hacked up (the bridge of a song here, the chorus there), forced to the background, and in the end, horribly covered by the hippest new indie band, Starsailor. My girlfriend asked the unnecessary, but irresistable question after the movie --was anyone up there, the writer, the producers, the director, actually a Gram Parson's fan? Well, no. He'd never actually heard of Gram Parsons, but of course, blah blah blah, I learned to love it, and here's some factoids I read in a bio online. Another guy vouched for Parsons' coolness by saying he and Keith Richards tripped on acid together and wrote \\"Wild Horses\\" together, a mixed up bunch of facts as off-base as the movie. Another person asked, wasn't it morally questionable to rewrite history when most people would only know about it from this film? Well, he had the real roadie's permission (he was even set) and the Parsons estate gave permission, and all these other people who got paychecks said it was great. But what I really wondered was, and asked in the embarassingly trembling voice of a truly impassioned Parsons geek, was, if the movie's so cheaply made (a million), had they not considered the original Gram Parsons fanbase as an audience? The director and writer seemed to think he was a nothing figure with no fanbase, though I doubt any Mojo magazine reading, country-rock 70's music fan would agree. But a bunch of Brits made it I guess, and they just didn't care about Cosmic American Music, or even knew it existed.

Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate?

Guardiola made seven changes ahead of Friday's European Super Cup showdown with Chelsea, but the European champions should have still wrapped up the three points. Xherdan Shaqiri put Bayern in front in the 33rd minute at the Mage-Solar Stadium, but paid the price for failing to add to their advantage when Freiburg substitute Nicolas Hofler leveled with four minutes remaining.

Greta ran to the corner with her older brother Tony. He had money for the ice cream truck in his pocket and she was very happy. The ice cream truck had been parked at the curb waiting for children for a very long time. The ice cream truck driver thought that no more children were coming to get ice cream so he started pulling away from the curb when they got to the corner. They yelled. They screamed, \\"Stop! Stop!\\" and jumped up and down on the side walk trying to get him to see them. The driver of the truck saw them, waved at them and smiled, pulled back to the curb and opened his truck up so that they could see everything that he had for sale. They were so excited.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who owns the company that had sold only 700,000 copies of Planet Waves? from the following article ? Dylan began 1973 by signing with a new label, David Geffen's Asylum Records (and Island in the UK), when his contract with Columbia Records expired. On his next album, Planet Waves, he used the Band as backing group, while rehearsing for a tour. The album included two versions of \\"Forever Young\\", which became one of his most popular songs. As one critic described it, the song projected \\"something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan\\", and Dylan himself commented: \\"I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental.\\"Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan, a collection of studio outtakes (almost exclusively covers), widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label. In January 1974, Dylan returned to touring after seven years; backed by the Band, he embarked on a North American tour of 40 concerts. A live double album, Before the Flood, was on Asylum Records. Soon, according to Clive Davis, Columbia Records sent word they \\"will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold\\". Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, miffed that while there had been millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour, Geffen had sold only 700,000 copies of Planet Waves. Dylan returned to Columbia Records, which reissued his two Asylum albums. After the tour, Dylan and his wife became estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures, and recorded an album entitled Blood on the Tracks in September 1974. Dylan delayed the release and re-recorded half the songs at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother, David Zimmerman.Released in early 1975, Blood on the Tracks received mixed reviews. In the NME, Nick Kent described \\"the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes.\\" In Rolling Stone, Jon Landau wrote that \\"the record has been made with typical shoddiness.\\" Over the years critics came to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements.

TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- The U.S. military in Japan has charged a Marine with rape and other violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in the alleged sexual assault of 14-year old girl in Okinawa. A civic group member protests against Hadnott near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo on February 13. Staff Sgt. Tyrone Luther Hadnott, 38, has been charged with the rape of a child under 16, abusive sexual contact with a child, making a false official statement, adultery and kidnapping, the Marines said Friday. No dates for the court-martial have been set. In February, Japanese authorities released Hadnott after the girl dropped the allegations against him, but the Marine Corps conducted its own investigation to see if Hadnott violated codes of military justice. It held him at a Marine facility. Two years ago, a","completion":"similar incident involving U.S. military personnel in Okinawa spurred massive public outcry and calls for a reevaluation of the presence of American forces in Japan. The case intensified tensions between the local community and the U.S. military, with concerns over the conduct of servicemen stationed in the area. Critics argue that such incidents serve as a painful reminder of past misconduct by American troops, symbolizing larger issues surrounding the ongoing presence of U.S. bases in the country. The relationship between the U.S. and Japan remains strained, as the Japanese government has been attempting to balance maintaining its alliance with the U.S., while also addressing the growing concern from its citizens over the presence of military bases—particularly in densely populated areas. Protests have erupted in recent years over the continued presence of U.S. military bases on Japanese soil, and these concerns have only been heightened by incidents involving criminal behavior from U.S. military personnel. In response to the outrage following this recent case of alleged sexual assault, both Japanese and U.S. officials have called for a renewed focus on educational and prevention programs to minimize the risk of future incidents involving servicemen. Moreover, the U.S. government has promised to work with the Japanese government in tightening regulations and increasing oversight of its military personnel stationed in the country. Although no dates for the court-martial of Staff Sgt. Hadnott have been set, one can expect it to receive significant attention from both the Japanese and international media. Many will see the outcome of the case as an indicator of the U.S. military's commitment to preventing further crimes, in addition to the existing initiatives aimed at fostering goodwill and cooperation between the two nations. The continued presence of American forces in Japan has been a delicate topic for both countries for decades. While the U.S. government and military officials emphasize their commitment to maintaining security and their ongoing cooperation with the Japanese, cases such as the alleged assault committed by Staff Sgt. Hadnott underscore the need for a more substantial effort towards addressing the long-standing issue of U.S. military personnel misconduct in Japan. In the long term, it is crucial for both countries to work together to find a viable solution that will benefit their mutual interests while keeping their respective citizens safe and secure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Rouvas was born on 5 January 1972 in the village of Mandoukion, near Corfu City on the island of Corfu, the eldest of four sons of Konstantinos \\"Kostas\\" Rouvas (an ambulance driver) and the teenaged Anna-Maria Panaretou (a duty-free shop clerk at the local airport). He has three brothers: Billy (b. Vasilios), Tolis (b. Apostolos, 1975) and Nikos (b. Nikolaos, 1991). The family was poor, and Rouvas began taking care of his brothers at age five. At age four, he exhibited athletic ability and took ballet classes as a child. Context: In December 1998 Rouvas released his sixth album (the first with his new label): Kati Apo Mena (Something From Me), written by Giorgos Theofanous. \\"Den Ehi Sidera I Kardia Sou\\" (\\"Your Heart Doesn't Have Steel Rails\\") was a hit, and remains one of his most-popular songs. To promote the album Rouvas performed at the Virgin Megastore in Athens, where thousands of fans created a traffic jam. The next year, Rouvas records \\"Oso Exo Esena\\" (\\"As Long As I Have You\\"), a duet with singer Stelios Rokkos. The two artists work and perform together at Bio Bio in Athens during the summer. In March 2000 Rouvas released his seventh album, 21os Akatallilos (21+ X-Rated), and performed with Katy Garbi at Pili Axiou in Thessaloniki. The album and its first single, \\"Andexa\\" (\\"I Held Out\\"), reached number one on the charts. During May rehearsals for summer performances Rouvas was hospitalized with abdominal pain, which was diagnosed as peritonitis and required an appendectomy. On 25 October 2000, he began appearing with Antonis Remos and Peggy Zina at Apollonas for the winter season. That year Rouvas became the Pepsi spokesperson for the company's Greek summer campaign making a first television ad, a first for a Greek entertainer. His collaboration with Pepsi continued into 2001, with a May television ad. The advertisement, featuring a semi-nude Rouvas holding a Pepsi bottle in front of his genitals, was controversial among women's rights and parental associations. Calling it \\"unsightly, vulgar and unacceptable\\", they tried to have the ad blocked as \\"disgrac[ing] childhood innocence and dignity.\\" The Pepsi Tour 2001, of seven Greek cities, followed. During summer 2000 Rouvas, Psinakis and a number of other celebrities visited Mykonos on a yacht borrowed from a local physician. They were accused of drug possession, since the yacht contained narcotics. The incident was publicized amid speculation that Rouvas might have a drug addiction. Although the doctor admitted that the narcotics were his, his guests were questioned. Wishing to avoid court, Rouvas paid a fine and minimized the incident. However, thousands of T-shirts were printed which read: \\"Imoun ki ego sto kotero!\\" (\\"I was on the yacht, too!\\"). Question: what was the name of his new label?.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who was a considerable influence on Handel in the three years that he spent in Hamburg? is inside the article: Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\"., can you guess it ?

John and Dizzy live in the same apartment building, but they have never crossed paths despite sharing mutual friends. Step 2: The Meet-cute One day after a long day at work, John takes a shortcut through a park as he walks home. Entranced by a captivating mural in-progress on a park wall, he finally meets its artist—Dizzy. The two strike up a conversation about their respective passions, finding themselves fascinated by each other's worlds. Step 3: Developing their friendship Dizzy and John start spending more time together as friends, collaborating on a project that combines both their interests: a mural illustrating residents' stories in a legal rights campaign. As they work together, they find camaraderie, inspiration, and support in their shared values. Step 4: The turning point Dizzy slowly falls in love with John as she discovers how compassionate, committed, and loyal he is toward his clients and friends. However, she hesitates because John’s all-consuming career leaves little room for personal relationships. Step 5: A potential roadblock A new high-profile case comes to John's attention, leaving him with even less time for Dizzy and threatening to derail their blossoming relationship. Dizzy, feeling neglected, seeks solace in her art and starts preparing for an exhibit. Step 6: The realization During the exhibit's opening night, John makes an appearance despite his overwhelming case responsibilities. As he admires Dizzy’s art, he sees a painting that powerfully encapsulates their shared moments and his own internal struggles. This realization ignites a newfound appreciation for the importance of love and relationships amidst his work in pursuing justice. Step 7: Overcoming barriers John decides to prioritize his personal life and make time for Dizzy. He finally confronts his feelings and expresses his love for Dizzy, who reciprocates his affection. Together, they navigate the balance of love, work, and art, inspiring each other to grow and flourish. Step 8: Happily ever after As the movie concludes, we see Dizzy and John living their lives in harmony, with John more open to love and Dizzy more grounded, both transforming each other's lives and working on projects that benefit the community.

Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and mechanics (the very theory he helped create), despite its acceptance by other physicists, stating that God \\"is not playing at dice.\\" Einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory, and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76. In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser. This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws. Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of mechanics.

If you haven't already done so, create a plan for what to do in the event of a recession. This risk management plan should include a set of actions you plan to take in the event that you lose business or customers due to an economic downturn. After all, it will be easier to think of what to do before a recession that in the heat of the moment as your employees are panicking and unsure of what to do. Make sure to create concrete steps to follow and then transmit the plan to other managers or partners so that they can follow it as well. Your first course of action when hit by a recession should be to cut expenses where you can. This will help your business stay in operation while you work out a more permanent solution or until the economy recovers. Look around to reduce overhead costs like utilities, administration, and wasted materials. You can also reduce your inventory levels so that your assets aren't so tied up in product that may go unsold for months. If those don't work, consider: Cutting your advertising spending. Pull out of traditional advertising like television and radio and instead focus on improving your social media presence. Doing so is free, even though it might take more of your time. Downsizing. Your other option to downsize. This can mean either reducing employees or moving to a cheaper location. Your remaining employees may have to work harder, but your business will at least be able to survive. If you do end up letting some employees go, you will need others to step into their roles. This is why it is important to cross-train your employees for various roles within the business. This is best if done before it is needed. You should focus all of your efforts on retaining regular customers and maintaining your relationships with them. Make sure that they know that their business is appreciated. In addition, keep your quality just as high as before, even it you've had to make other cuts around the business. A recession is also a good opportunity to evaluate your customers. You may have those customers who are not profitable to work with. A recession is the perfect time to sever these relationships and seek new ones. Many businesses turn to deals and sales when the recession is hurting them. However, doing so will only make it harder for customers to justify paying your regular prices when the recession is over. In addition, these lower prices can cut into much needed profits. The only exception is that you may want to offer one-time payment extensions or discounts to customers that are also having a hard time. Just be clear to them that you are only extending this service once.","completion":"Create a risk management plan for potential recessions, detailing actions to take if business declines due to economic downturn.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: I have been teaching animal behavior at the Boulder County Prison in Colorado for 10 years. The course is one of the most popular in the prison. Prisoners have to earn the right to attend the course and they work hard to get in. One reason why the course is so popular is that many prisoners find it easier to connect with animals than with people, because animals don't judge them. They trust animals in ways they don't with humans. Yet, they hold a misunderstanding of how animals treat one another. Many admit that their own \\"animal behavior\\" is what got them into trouble in the first place. I teach that though there is competition and aggression in the animal kingdom, there is also a lot of cooperation and sympathy. Many of the students want to build healthy relationships, and they find that the class helps them. I use examples of the social behavior of group-living animals such as wolves as a model for developing and maintaining friendships among people who must work together for their own good and also for the good of the group. It's clear that science inspires the students here and it also gives them hope. I know some students have gone back into education after their being set free while others have gone to work for humane societies or contributed time and money to conservation organizations. One went on to receive a master's degree in nature writing. Science and humane education help the prisoners connect with values that they otherwise would not have done. It opens the door to understanding, trust, cooperation and hope. There's a large population of people to whom science could mean a lot, if only they could have access to it. The class helps me, too. I get as much out of it as the students and it has made me a better teacher. Question: The author's course is welcomed by the prisoners because _ .

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person decides they want to weigh less happens, how will it affect LESS erosion by the ocean. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"If a person decides they want to weigh less, there is no direct or significant indirect effect on the process of coastal erosion by ocean waves. Their personal decision and efforts to lose weight would not have any notable impact on the natural phenomena of wave energy, sediment movement, or erosion. The perturbation in this case is too small and unrelated, thus it would not influence the coastal erosion process in any meaningful way. Coastal erosion is driven by complex interaction of various natural factors, including wave energy, tidal action, geological properties of the coast, and climate change-related factors such as sea-level rise. This process is not dependent on everyday human activities such as personal change in weight. Any significant change to the erosion process would require a large-scale alteration in these natural factors, either through direct human intervention (e.g., building structures along coastlines or implementing coastal protection measures) or through complex global changes in climate and environmental conditions that influence the nature and intensity of ocean waves and sediment transport."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Tom Swift and His Motor Boat or The Rivals of Lake Carlopa is Volume 2 in the original Tom Swift novel series published by Grosset & Dunlap.

Given the question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: what money to take to sri lanka?

I will then provide a comprehensive response. Step 1: Identify the local currency After researching, I found that the Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR) is the local currency in Sri Lanka. Step 2: Check current exchange rates I would look up the current exchange rates for the user's currency to the Sri Lankan Rupee. The exchange rate is subject to change, so it is essential to check close to the travel date. Step 3: Consider exchanging currency before travel To avoid the hassle of finding a currency exchange point upon arrival, I'd suggest exchanging a small amount of cash to LKR before departing. This will be helpful for initial expenses like transportation or snacks. Step 4: Be aware of currency exchange rules and limits Sri Lanka has some restrictions on how much foreign currency can be brought into the country. According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, a visitor can bring up to USD 15,000 or its equivalent without declaration. So, it's important to keep that in mind when planning the amount of money to carry. Step 5: Consider using credit or debit cards It's a good idea to check if your credit or debit card is accepted in Sri Lanka. Visa and MasterCard are widely accepted, and using cards can be more convenient than carrying cash. Moreover, the exchange rates offered by your card provider may be better than local currency exchange offices. However, I would recommend having some cash on hand due to not all businesses accepting card payments. Based on my research: The answer is: Take the local currency, Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR), for your trip. Before traveling, exchange a small amount of money to LKR and consider carrying some USD or equivalent foreign currency within the allowed limit. Check the current exchange rates and use your credit or debit card where possible for payments, as it might offer better exchange rates."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Plot title: Night Watch Movie plot: Based on a play by Lucille Fletcher, Night Watch is a suspense thriller about a woman named Ellen Wheeler (Elizabeth Taylor), who one night, during a raging thunderstorm, frantically tells her husband John (Laurence Harvey) that from the living room window she has seen a murder being committed in the large old deserted house next door. John calls the police, but a search of the old house turns up nothing. The next morning, Ellen notices a freshly planted bed of flowers in the garden of the old house, that was not there before. She calls the investigating detective, Inspector Walker (Bill Dean), and suggests that the body of the murder victim she witnessed may be buried there. Inspector Walker then questions the caretaker of the old house, Mr. Appleby (Robert Lang), who confirms that he planted the flowers the night before during the storm, but refuses to let the police search the garden or dig up the flowers he just planted. Ellen is revealed to be recovering from a mental breakdown that occurred after her unfaithful first husband, Carl, was killed a few years earlier in an auto accident with his paramour. Ellen was traumatized by having to identify the bodies in the local morgue. Inspector Walker confides to John that Ellen may be mentally ill and suggests rest and a doctor. Ellen continues to maintain that she saw a murder in the deserted house, but there is no proof and John remains skeptical. Ellen's visiting friend Sarah Cooke (Billie Whitelaw) is equally skeptical and tries humoring Ellen by suggesting that she sees what she thinks she sees because of her recent breakdown. When both Ellen and Sarah see a man enter the old house the following night, they call the police, who find Mr. Appleby wandering around with a flashlight and arrest him for trespassing. A second search of the house and excavation of the garden reveal nothing, and Inspector Walker closes the case. John then brings over a psychiatrist friend of his, Tony (Tony Britton).

As such, their care and ownership come with many responsibilities. One crucial aspect of owning a pedigreed pet is managing the official documentation, particularly when transferring ownership from one individual to another. In this article, we will explore the role of pet registration certificates and pedigree associations in the ownership transfer process. Furthermore, we will discuss the necessary steps required to ensure this transition is seamless and legally sound. Importance of Pet Registration Certificates Registration certificates serve a crucial role in the world of pedigreed pets. These documents act as official records, representing the pet's ancestry, pedigree, and current legal owner. In essence, the certificate verifies that the pet is a genuine purebred specimen of its breed, allowing for reliable traceability of its lineage. The registration certificate also provides legitimacy and integrity, ensuring that the pet is protected from the illegal pet trade while also recognizing the breeders' commitment to responsible pet breeding and care. Pedigree Associations – Guardians of Breed Integrity Pedigree associations serve as the custodians of the breed’s heritage and pedigree data. Organizations like the American Kennel Club (AKC), the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), and the American Bird Breeders Association (ABBA) maintain comprehensive breed and lineage records, allowing for the surveillance and enforcement of breed standards and ethical practices in pet breeding and ownership. These pedigree associations are not merely record-keepers; they take an active part in ensuring the welfare, recognition, and preservation of the breed. By maintaining a robust and verifiable record of purebred pets, pedigree associations help to protect the breed's unique characteristics and identities while combating unscrupulous breeding practices and unregulated pet sales. The Pet Ownership Transfer Process Transferring the ownership of a pedigreed pet involves a series of specific steps, both on the part of the current (old) owner and the new owner. This process helps to ensure that the chain of custody and legal responsibility for the pet moves smoothly from one party to another. Here is a detailed overview of these vital steps: 1. Locate the pet's registration certificate: Before starting the transfer process, the current owner must locate the pet's registration certificate. This document is essential for providing the pedigree association with an accurate record of the pet, its lineage, and the fact that it has been legally owned and registered. If the certificate is lost or misplaced, contact the pedigree association that issued the document to discuss the process for obtaining a duplicate or replacement. 2. Fill in the transfer information on the back of the certificate: After locating the pet's registration certificate, the current owner will need to complete the transfer section located on the back of the document. This part requires information about the new owner, such as their full name, address, and contact details. It is important to ensure that all of this information is correct and up-to-date to prevent any issues during the transfer process. 3. Sign the certificate as the old owner: As the current owner of the pedigreed pet, you must sign the transfer section of the registration certificate, indicating your intention to relinquish your legal ownership. This signature is a critical step in demonstrating your consent and confirming the accuracy of the provided information. It also helps to verify the authenticity of the document. 4. Mail the certificate to the pedigree association: After completing and signing the transfer section of the pet's registration certificate, the old owner should mail the document to the relevant pedigree association. The association will process the transfer request and update their records accordingly. After the transfer is completed, the pedigree association will issue a new registration certificate in the name of the new owner, thus establishing their legal ownership. Conclusion The transfer of pet ownership is an important part of ensuring the welfare and protection of pedigreed pets. By abiding by the process outlined in this article, pet owners can ensure a smooth and efficient ownership transfer while maintaining the integrity of the pet's lineage and breed. Remember, managing the official documentation is essential not just for the pet owner, but also for the breed and future generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As Leslie's eyes welled up with tears, Nelson instinctively wrapped his arms around her, attempting to provide solace in this heart-wrenching situation. They stood on the sidewalk, surrounded by other concerned neighbors who had rushed out of their houses upon hearing the terrifying screeching of the car tires and the sorrowful cries that followed. Mrs. Thompson's dog, a sweet and friendly Golden Retriever named Buddy, had been more than just a pet to the whole community; he was a symbol of hope and happiness that greeted everyone each morning with a wagging tail and boundless enthusiasm. Buddy had been instrumental in helping several children, including Leslie, overcome their fear of dogs after they had endured traumatic experiences with other animals. Over time, the whole neighborhood had come to love and cherish Buddy as if he were their own pet. As Leslie sobbed into Nelson's embrace, her thoughts turned to Mrs. Thompson, whose own tears mixed with the blood and dirt as she cradled the lifeless body of her beloved dog. Losing Buddy would be a tremendous blow to the fragile widow, who had found solace and companionship in her pet after her husband's passing a few years earlier. It was well known that Buddy had been a gift from her late husband, making the bond between the two even more profound and meaningful. Nelson, his heart aching for his friend and everyone who adored Buddy, felt a genuine sense of responsibility to offer comfort in this difficult time. He gently stroked Leslie's hair and whispered soothing words into her ear, assuring her that Buddy's life - though cut tragically short - had nonetheless been full of love, joy, and warmth. He reminded her that Buddy's indomitable spirit would live on not only in the hearts of those who cherished him, but in the happiness and courage he had instilled in so many people within the community. As they stood there amidst the quiet sobs of neighbors and the echo of the fading sirens, Nelson knew that this day would be etched in their memories forever, and yet he also knew something else; the community would rally together in the coming days to support Mrs. Thompson and hold one another a little closer, reminded of the transient nature of life. Together, they would honor Buddy's memory and continue the legacy of love and connection that the cherished dog had so effortlessly fostered during his time in their lives. And so, as the sun began to set on that somber day, Nelson continued to comfort Leslie in the middle of the street, the scent of freshly cut grass carried on the breeze, a reminder of the simpler days and shared happiness they had all experienced with the cherished dog that had simply been known as Buddy, the one who had belonged to their beloved Mrs. Thompson."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Step 1: Establish the film's setting and time period To build a movie plot, I'll first choose a setting and a time period. I'll set the film in a diverse, bustling city like New York in modern times. Step 2: Develop the main characters - Shaw: A mysterious yet charming philanthropist and entrepreneur. He is the one sending out the invitation. - Salvadore: A young and ambitious artist seeking recognition and financial stability. He accepts Shaw's invitation. Step 3: Create the inciting incident The inciting incident will be Shaw discovering Salvadore's art at an underground gallery exhibition. Intrigued by his talent, Shaw leaves a personal invitation for Salvadore to join him and a group of other artists for an exclusive mentorship program. Step 4: Establish key events and relationships - Salvadore initially struggles with the decision to accept Shaw's invitation, but after weighing his options, he decides to join. This decision is the answer to the original question. - From here, the plot will focus on Salvadore's journey within the mentorship program, where he meets other talented and driven like-minded individuals. He becomes fast friends with some, rivals with others, and even falls for a fellow artist named Lyra. - Shaw's mentorship program is not traditional, as the artists are pushed to take risks, discover new mediums, and explore the darker sides of their talents. - Shaw becomes a mentor/antagonist figure to Salvadore, making our protagonist question his values, art, and life choices along the way. Step 5: Develop turning points and conflicts - As the story progresses, Salvadore and the other artists must confront their personal demons and insecurities while continuing to grow their artistry under Shaw's guidance. - Salvadore feels the pressure of performing under extreme conditions and starts to see a negative change in his mental state and relationships with the other artists, particularly with Lyra. Step 6: Climactic events and resolution - As the mentorship program comes to an end, Shaw offers Salvadore an opportunity of a lifetime: a solo exhibition at a prestigious gallery, with the promise of fame and fortune. - Salvadore realizes that despite the potential success awaiting him, the cost of what he's gone through and what he has become is too great. He makes a difficult decision and turns down the offer, ultimately breaking free from Shaw's influence. - Salvadore reconciles with Lyra and the other artists, realizing that genuine connections and remaining grounded are more important than superficial success. - The movie ends with Salvadore's return to his roots as an artist, reconnecting with his passion and love for art, and setting off on a new journey of self-discovery and genuine growth. In conclusion, the answer to the original question is: Salvadore accepts Shaw's invitation to join him on an exclusive art mentorship program that tests the limits of his artistry and personal relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"James Chadwick, a British physicist, is best known for his discovery of the neutron in 1932. Born on October 20, 1891, Chadwick was an extremely important figure in the field of atomic and nuclear physics. Before Chadwick's discovery, the atomic nucleus was thought to consist only of positively charged protons. However, the nuclear masses of most elements were observed to be nearly double the proton masses, which implied that there existed other subatomic particles in the atomic nucleus. In 1930, a German physicist named Walther Bothe observed an unusual form of radiation that was generated after bombarding the element beryllium with alpha particles (helium nuclei). These radiations did not produce the characteristic ionization effects predicted when existing forms of radiation, such as alpha, beta, and gamma rays, interacted with other elements. This raised the possibility that some other form of radiation or particle was being emitted. At the time, it was hypothesized that the observed radiation was a new form of electromagnetic radiation, which was dubbed \\"gamma rays.\\" Chadwick, however, was not convinced by this explanation. He began conducting a series of experiments to verify whether these observed radiations were a new form of electromagnetic radiation or a neutral, thus far undiscovered, subatomic particle. Chadwick used a variety of elements, including oxygen and carbon, as target materials and studied their interactions with the mysterious radiation. He observed that each of these substances emitted a stream of charged protons when they were struck by the mysterious radiation. This observation indicated that these radiations were composed of subatomic particles with a mass similar to that of protons but with no electric charge. To confirm the neutrality of these particles and also their mass, Chadwick performed a quantitative analysis. Collaborating with other researchers, he utilized additional elements, such as hydrogen, to calculate the mass of these new particles. After exhaustive analysis and numerous experimental data, he published his findings in a paper, where he introduced the neutron as the neutral, subatomic particle with a mass very close to that of protons. Chadwick's identification of the neutron revolutionized the field of nuclear physics and laid the foundation for many subsequent discoveries, such as nuclear fission, the atomic bomb, and nuclear power. Additionally, Chadwick's discovery significantly advanced our understanding of the atomic nucleus structure. The existence of neutrons, in combination with protons, could now explain the observed atomic masses of many elements. Moreover, the idea of isotopes – different forms of the same element with varying numbers of neutrons and the same number of protons – could now be fully comprehended through Chadwick's discovery. In recognition of his valuable contribution to the field of science, James Chadwick was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935. His discovery of the neutron and its properties remain crucial to the understanding of atomic and nuclear physics, further emphasizing the significance of his work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the leader who brought Armenians with the Mongols who returned to Jerusalem? Without support from the Europeans, some Franks in Outremer, particularly the Knights Hospitaller of the fortress of Marqab, and to some extent the Franks of Cyprus and Antioch, attempted to join in combined operations with the Mongols in 1280–1281. The death of the Egyptian leader Baibars in 1277 led to disorganization in the Muslim territories, making conditions ripe for a new action by other factions in the Holy Land. The Mongols seized the opportunity, organized a new invasion of Syria, and in September 1280 occupied Bagras and Darbsak, followed by Aleppo on October 20. The Mongol leader Abaqa, taking advantage of his momentum, sent envoys to Edward I of England, the Franks of Acre, King Hugh of Cyprus, and Bohemond VII of Tripoli (son of Bohemond VI), requesting their support for the campaign. But the Crusaders were not organized enough themselves to be of much help. In Acre, the Patriarch's Vicar replied that the city was suffering from hunger, and that the king of Jerusalem was already embroiled in another war. Local Knights Hospitaller from Marqab (in the area which had previously been Antioch/Tripoli) were able to make raids into the Beqaa Valley, as far as the Mamluk-held Krak des Chevaliers in 1280 and 1281. Hugh and Bohemond of Antioch mobilized their armies, but their forces were prevented from joining those of the Mongols by Baibars' successor, the new Egyptian Sultan Qalawun. He advanced north from Egypt in March 1281, positioned his own army between the Franks and Mongols, and then further divided the potential allies by renewing a truce with the Barons of Acre on May 3, 1281, extending it for another ten years and ten months (a truce he would later breach). He also renewed a second 10-year truce with Bohemond VII of Tripoli on July 16, 1281, and affirmed pilgrim access to Jerusalem.In September 1281 the Mongols returned, with 50,000 of their own troops, plus 30,000 others including Armenians under Leo III, Georgians, and 200 Knights Hospitaller from Marqab, who sent a contingent even though...

Possible A: tropical forests, dictionary, amazon basin, congo, tropical rain forest Why is \\"amazon basin\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"Amazon Basin is an answer aligned with human common sense for the following reasons: 1. Context relevance: The question mentions that the sloth heard Portuguese being spoken nearby. Portuguese is the official language of Brazil, which is home to a large part of the Amazon Basin.

Sloth's habitat: Sloths are native to Central and South America, specifically in tropical rainforests. The Amazon Basin is a vast tropical rainforest region, making it a suitable habitat for sloths. 3. Plausibility of other options: - Tropical forests: This option is quite general, and while it could be a possible answer, it doesn't provide a specific location. The Amazon Basin, being a more focused area, would align more closely with human common sense. - Dictionary: This option isn't a geographical location and doesn't explain where the sloth was when it heard Portuguese, so it can be ruled out by common sense. - Congo: While it is a tropical rainforest region, the Congo is located in Africa, where both sloths and Portuguese as a common language are not native. Therefore, this option can be ruled out by common sense. - Tropical rain forest: This option, like \\"tropical forests,\\" is too general and does not provide context for the presence of Portuguese speakers.

If you don't currently have a photo that fits this description, take a new one! Bring along a camera next time you go to a social event, and ask a friend to take a quick snap of you. Avoid professional headshots. They're too stilted for an online dating site, and you'll look like you're trying too hard. Your bio. Most websites will provide a short bio or \\"about me\\" section for you to fill in. Don't write a novel, but do provide enough information that potential partners will feel like they're gaining a sense of who you are. You can discuss your hobbies, your goals, what you look for in a relationship, any children you have, or whatever else defines you as a person. Resist the urge to vent about your previous relationship. \\"Recently divorced from a lying, cheating harlot\\" reads as \\"bitter and angry\\" instead of \\"dateable and balanced.\\" Your interests. Some sites will have a separate area for you to list interests or hobbies. Sports, musical genres or groups, crafts, historical periods, movie genres, types of food, travel destinations, and books are all appropriate topics for this part of your profile. Who you're interested in meeting. Try not to be too restrictive on these parameters. You never know — your soulmate might only be a year or two older than the top age you specify. Keep your ranges broad, and remember that you're not obligated to date everyone who contacts you. If you're asked to describe in writing the type of girl you'd like to meet, this is the place to knock it out of the park. Don't say \\"I just want someone to talk to\\" — no girl wants to be \\"just someone to talk to\\" when another man will call her a princess or the light of his life. Talk up your future partner in the best terms you can muster. For instance, you might try something like \\"I'm looking for the woman of my dreams, who will share my passion for cooking, cycling and honesty, and who will allow me to treat her like the queen she is.\\" Your contact settings. Some sites allow you to pick and choose who can see your profile or contact you. If you want to get a lot of responses, make sure it's easy for people to message or email you.","completion":"Online dating sites help people find friends and partners. There are free sites like PlentyofFish and OkCupid, and paid sites like Match.com and eHarmony. Some websites are for people who share the same religion.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"Suppose there is less damage by acid rain, meaning that the acidity levels in the water are not as high, and the absorption of aluminum from the soil is reduced. If this perturbation were to occur, it would have several possible effects (direct or indirect) on the process: 1. Direct effect: With less acidity and reduced amounts of aluminum, the immediate harm to fish, their eggs, frogs, and plants may be lessened. As a result, their populations could potentially stabilize or recover to a certain extent, thus preventing further decline in their numbers. 2. Indirect effect: A healthier aquatic ecosystem, due to less damage by acid rain, would positively impact the other wildlife that depends on it. Insects and other species that rely on the fish, frogs, and plants for their survival would also experience population stabilization or growth. 3. Indirect effect: A more balanced and healthier ecosystem could be more resilient to other environmental stressors, such as pollution and climate change. This increased resilience would help the ecosystem to better withstand any future instances of acid rain. 4. Indirect effect: If less damage from acid rain were to occur due to changes in human behavior or policies (e.g., reductions in pollution emissions), this could potentially contribute to a more significant improvement in ecosystem health, acting as a positive feedback loop. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of less damage by acid rain would have both direct and indirect effects on the process, leading to a more balanced and healthier ecosystem.

She was born in Russia and had been stranded by the Russian Revolution of 1917 with her sister at a finishing school in Geneva. In 1919, Szigeti and Ostrowska decided to get married, but due to the turbulent political situation in Europe, many unexpected bureaucratic obstacles were thrown up in their path. The first problem was the impossibility of contacting Ostrowska's family, and the couple were forced to go ahead without parental consent, with the permission only of Ostrowska's sister and the headmistress of the finishing school. Further bureaucratic entanglements threatened the young couple's hopes, but eventually the officials responsible granted them a dispensation to marry. Szigeti recalls in his memoirs the words of Consul General Baron de Montlong at the critical moment: Let us not, if we can avoid it, fall victim to the dead letter of the law. I don't want to postpone the happiness of these two youngsters if we can help it. All laws have been twisted and tortured out of semblance of law, what with war and revolutions. For once let's twist and turn one for a good cause, yes? Just before the birth of their only child, daughter Irene, Szigeti found himself stuck in Berlin during the Kapp Putsch of 1920, unable to return to Geneva. The entire city had been paralyzed by a general strike, and the trains were not running. His scheduled concert could not go on as planned, but he was forced to stay in Berlin for \\"interminable days\\" while the Putsch ran its course. Szigeti writes: \\"... the impossibility of communicating by phone or wire with my wife--whose condition I pictured with the somewhat lurid pessimism usual to young prospective fathers--was certainly a greater torment to me than all the other discomforts put together\\".

A conservative, he hosts the Glenn Beck Radio Program, a popular talk-radio show nationally syndicated on Premiere Radio Networks. Beck also hosts the Glenn Beck television program, which ran from January 2006 to October 2008 on HLN, from January 2009 to June 2011 on the Fox News Channel and currently airs on TheBlaze. Glenn Lee Beck was born in Everett, Washington, the son of Mary Clara (nee Janssen) and William Beck, who lived in Mountlake Terrace, Washington, at the time of their son's birth. The family later moved to Mount Vernon, Washington, where they owned and operated City Bakery in the downtown area. He is descended from German immigrants who came to the United States in the 19th century. Beck was raised as a Roman Catholic and attended Immaculate Conception Catholic School in Mount Vernon. Glenn and his older sister moved with their mother to Sumner, Washington, attending a Jesuit school in Puyallup. On May 15, 1979, while out on a small boat with a male companion, Beck's mother drowned just west of Tacoma, Washington, in Puget Sound. The man who had taken her out in the boat also drowned. A Tacoma police report stated that Mary Beck \\"appeared to be a classic drowning victim\\", but a Coast Guard investigator speculated that she could have intentionally jumped overboard. Beck has described his mother's death as a suicide in interviews during television and radio broadcasts. After their mother's death, Beck and his older sister moved to their father's home in Bellingham, Washington, where Beck graduated from Sehome High School in June 1982. Beck also regularly vacationed with his maternal grandparents, Ed and Clara Janssen, in Iowa. In the aftermath of his mother's death and subsequent suicide of his stepbrother, Beck has said he used \\"Dr. Jack Daniel's\\" to cope. At 18, following his high school graduation, Beck relocated to Provo, Utah, and worked at radio station KAYK.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. I am facing a new situation today: Recently a large amount of factories have been built in Illinois using fossil fuels as their main energy source. In Indiana however, many of their factories have been shut down and replaced by parks with many plants and trees. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Given Illinois adds even more of these fossil fuel burning factories will the levels of carbon dioxide increase or decrease? A:","completion":"Given the information from the background article and the new situation, the correct answer is that the levels of carbon dioxide will likely increase if Illinois adds even more fossil fuel burning factories. The background article explains that burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, trap heat within the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to global warming and climate change. By increasing the number of factories in Illinois that rely on fossil fuels as their main energy source, more carbon dioxide will be released into the atmosphere. In contrast, the situation in Indiana where factories are replaced with parks containing numerous plants and trees is likely to have a different impact on carbon dioxide levels. Plants and trees absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, helping to convert it into oxygen as part of the carbon cycle. This reduces the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Thus, Indiana's actions could help mitigate some of the effects of carbon dioxide emissions. However, it may not be enough to counterbalance the increased emissions from the new factories in Illinois. In conclusion, if Illinois continues to add more fossil fuel burning factories, it will likely lead to an increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. This can contribute to global warming and climate change. Meanwhile, the efforts in Indiana to replace factories with parks and green spaces could provide some benefits to the environment, but the overall impact will still likely be an increase in carbon dioxide levels due to the additional emissions from Illinois."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We can combine these terms by adding them: -257151*l + 257189*l = (257189 - 257151) * l = 38 * l Now the equation simplifies to: -760 = 38*l 2. Isolate the variable l: Now we need to isolate the variable l by dividing each side of the equation by 38: -760 = 38 * l => (-760) / 38 = 38 * l / 38 => -20 = l So, the solution for the given equation is l = -20."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Where does Homer work after dropping out of high school to support his family? Title: October Sky Movie plot: The film is set in Coalwood, West Virginia in the year 1957. The coal mine is the town's largest employer and almost every man living in the town works in the mines. John Hickam (Chris Cooper), the mine superintendent, loves his job and hopes that his boys, Jim (Scott Miles) and Homer (Jake Gyllenhaal), will one day join him in his mine. When it appears that Jim will receive a football scholarship to attend college, this leaves Homer to fulfill his father's dream, although his mother, Elsie (Natalie Canerday), hopes for more for her son.In October, news of the Soviet Union's rocket launch of Sputnik 1 reaches Coalwood. As the townspeople gather outside the night of the broadcast, they see the satellite orbit across the sky. Filled with awe and a belief that this may be his chance out of Coalwood, Homer sets out to build rockets of his own and enter the science fair. Initially, his family and later his classmates think he has gone crazy and is wasting his time, especially when he teams up with Quentin Wilson (Chris Owen), the school's math geek who also has an interest in rocket engineering. With the help of his friends, Roy Lee Cooke (William Lee Scott) and Sherman O'Dell (Chad Lindberg), and support from their science teacher, Miss Riley (Laura Dern), the four try out their new passion. While their first launches are failures, they begin experimenting with new fuels and rocket designs. After several successful launches, the local paper runs a story about them.The next day, they are arrested accused of having started a forest fire with a rocket that had gone astray. After John picks up Homer from the police station, Roy Lee is seen getting beat up by his stepfather, Vernon. John intervenes and rescues Roy Lee, warning the drunken man that, even though Roy Lee's father is dead, he will fight for Roy Lee as Roy Lee's father would have. In a rare display of emotion, he tells Roy Lee that Roy's father was one of the best men who ever worked for him.The arrests, along with John's lack of support, crushes the boys'...

Write a question about the following article: The Broncos' defense limited Titans' quarterback Marcus Mariota to only 88 yards passing on 6 of 20 attempts; however, the Titans controlled the first half time of possession by a 2-1 margin and led 10-0 in the first quarter. Running back DeMarco Murray rushed for a 1-yard touchdown and placekicker Ryan Succop kicked a 53-yard field goal; the latter scoring play occurred after the Titans' defense forced a fumble off Broncos' running back Justin Forsett. A 41-yard field goal by Succop just before halftime gave the Titans a 13-0 lead. The Broncos' offense did not cross midfield in the first half. After a scoreless third quarter, the Broncos were attempting to cut into the Titans' lead early in the fourth quarter, but the Titans' defense stopped the Broncos on a 4th-and-goal. After forcing a Titans' punt, the Broncos finally got on the scoreboard with ten minutes remaining in the game, with quarterback Trevor Siemian connecting on a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders. After forcing a three-and-out from the Titans, the Broncos marched down to as far as the Titans' 16-yard line, but had to settle on a 34-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus to narrow the Titans' lead to 13-10 with 4:33 remaining in the game. After forcing another Titans' punt, the Broncos had one last possession, hoping for a rally. With 1:04 remaining in the game, Siemian completed a pass to tight end A. J. Derby at the 41-yard line, however, Titans' linebacker Avery Williamson forced a fumble off Derby, which was recovered by safety Daimion Stafford to seal the win for the Titans.","completion":"How did the Titans' defense contribute to their victory over the Broncos, considering they limited Marcus Mariota's passing to 88 yards and forced significant turnovers throughout the game?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

American buildings of the Georgian period were very often constructed of wood with clapboards; even columns were made of timber, framed up, and turned on an over-sized lathe. At the start of the period the difficulties of obtaining and transporting brick or stone made them a common alternative only in the larger cities, or where they were obtainable locally. Dartmouth College, Harvard University, and the College of William and Mary, offer leading examples of Georgian architecture in the Americas. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What type of architecture was sparsely scattered through the English colonies during the Georgian era","completion":"The type of architecture that was widely spread through the English colonies during the Georgian era was, as suggested in your statement, Georgian architecture. Named after the ruling monarchs of the time, King George I, II, and III, Georgian architecture was characterized by its sense of proportion and balance, simplicity and grandeur. Georgian architecture was popular from 1714 to 1830, and its influence was not only confined to England, it spread to its various colonies as well. In the English colonies of America, Georgian architecture played an important role and its influence can be seen in the designs of many historic buildings. Design elements of Georgian architecture included rigid symmetry in building mass as well as window and door placement. The design was based on the classical proportions of Roman and Greek architecture, and it often included elements such as columned porticos, pediments, and friezes. The use of high-quality materials, like stone and brick, were ideal but they were problematic in terms of obtaining and transporting them in the colonies. For this reason, colonial Georgian buildings, such as those mentioned in your question like Dartmouth College, Harvard University, and the College of William and Mary, often used locally available materials like wood. This twist gave rise to a more vernacular form of Georgian architecture, sometimes known as 'Colonial Georgian'. In Colonial Georgian Architecture, even columns would sometimes be made of timber, framed up, and then turned on an oversized lathe. Clapboards were often used for constructing these buildings. This adoption of local materials gave the Georgian style a distinct flair in the colonies, making it both practical and aesthetically pleasing. Therefore, it's safe to say, Georgian architecture was not \\"sparsely scattered\\" but rather extensively incorporated and adapted by the English colonies during the Georgian era. It remains a significant part of the architectural history of these regions, showcasing a harmonious blend of English design principles with local materials and construction techniques."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose baton Monteux studied under? is inside the article: Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person under whose baton Monteux studied is Nikisch, as referenced in the text where it states \\"As an orchestral conductor he modeled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.\\" Arthur Nikisch was a celebrated Hungarian conductor, known for his dynamic and passionate conducting style."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"One of the four courts of last resort in France, that was established in 1790 under the name Tribunal de cassation is?\\" Context: \\"France's highest courts are located in Paris.

After the consigliere (assistant) to the Mafia Don dies, crushed by a crate of tuna-fish cans, small-time hood George (David Proval) sees his chance to move up. Together with his dim-witted sidekick, Dip (Dan Moran), they celebrate with some prostitutes â George is ecstatic when treated to the oral talents of Glorice (Candis Cayne), the new girl on the docks. When they realize they've forgotten mob boss Joey \\"The Heart\\" Aorta's (Tony Sirico) birthday, George suggests a date with the beautiful Glorice. But the date doesn't go well, and Aorta ends up with plate of spaghetti on his head. Fortunately, Aorta likes Glorice's tough style, and George and Dip celebrate. Their festivities are cut short when they discover that Glorice is a transsexual woman. The two try introducing Aorta to other women, but none can match up to Glorice because, as Aorta says, \\"She's got balls\\". The Mafia Don even thanks George with a kiss, and George panics, thinking he's received the ominous \\"Kiss of Death\\". But his fear is unfounded as Aorta promotes George to consigliere and throws him a party with a cake made by Mickey the Baker (Gerry Cooney). As the assistant and new friend to the boss, George is forced to drive the two on a date which ends with Aorta on the receiving end of Glorice's oral talents. Aorta announces his engagement to Glorice with George to be best man, and the beautiful moll reveals to George her plan of blackmail. So George decides to hire hitman Briles (Jerry Grayson), an expert assassin. But he fails when Glorice recognizes the hitman as a long-lost uncle, and the hitman is unwilling to kill a nephew in a dress. George, dejected, walks the streets when he's suddenly tackled by a draft detective. George proves his undraftable 4-F status by showing his flat feet. Discovering Glorice in the draft detective's wanted file, George turns Glorice in to the Navy. When Glorice doesn't turn up at the wedding, Aorta cries on George's shoulder, believing Glorice left him at the altar.... The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Mafia Don, Joey \\"The Heart\\" Aorta, thanked George by kissing him. Initially, George panicked, thinking he received the ominous 'Kiss of Death', a symbolic gesture in Mafia culture often used to indicate that a member of the family has been marked for death. However, his fear was unfounded as Aorta's intent was actually to promote him to the position of consigliere (assistant) and throw him a party. This promotion was received with a celebration that included a cake made by Mickey the Baker. The kiss, therefore, was not a death sentence but rather a gesture of gratitude and promotion. Later, Aorta also tasked George to be the best man for his engagement to Glorice.

Reese wants to become a higher level agent with more responsibilities. As the result of a shortage of agents in France, he is assigned as a partner to secret agent Charlie Wax (John Travolta). Reese's first test is to have Wax released from airport detention by the French Customs when Wax does not want to surrender the cans of his favorite energy drink. Despite the apparent triviality of an energy drink that Wax could probably purchase in Paris, Wax continues to verbally abuse French Customs until Reese places a Diplomatic Mail sticker on Wax's luggage containing the energy drink, which makes them immune from customs and quarantine requirements. Once in the car, Wax apologizes for his behavior while opening the tins and revealing the concealed pieces of his personal SIG Sauer P226 X-Five Lightweight, which he refers to as \\"Mrs. Jones\\".

Please answer the following question: Millions of stars are travelling about in space. A few form groups which travel together, but most of them travel alone. And they travel through a universe which is so large that one star seldom comes near to another. For the most important part each star makes its journey in complete loneliness, like a ship on an empty ocean. The ship will be well over a million miles from its nearest neighbour. From this it is easy to understand why a star seldom finds another anywhere near it. We believe, however, that some two thousand million years ago, another star wandering through space, happened to come near our sun just as the sun and the moon raised its tides on the earth, so this star must have raised tides on the surface of the sun. But they were very different from the small tides that are raised in our oceans; A large tidal wave must have travelled over the surface of the sun, at last forming a mountain so high that we cannot imagine it. As the cause of the disturbance came nearer, so the mountain rose higher and higher. And before the star began to move away again, its tidal pull had become so powerful that this mountain was torn to pieces and thrown off small parts of itself into space. These small pieces have been going round the sun ever since. They are the planets. Some two thousand years ago, the mountain on the sun was raised probably because _ . A) the star moved away from the sun B) another star happened to come near the sun C) the sun and the moon raised the tides on the earth D) a large tidal of wave travelled over the surface of the sun Answer:","completion":"B) another star happened to come near the sun The formation of planets, as described in the question, is believed to have occurred around two thousand million years ago when another star happened to come near our sun. As the stars in the universe travel mostly alone and seldom come near each other, this event was quite remarkable. The gravitational pull between two massive celestial bodies, like the sun and the wandering star, resulted in strong tidal forces. Similar to how the sun and the moon interact with the Earth to create tides in our oceans, the nearby star raised tides on the surface of the sun. However, these tides were very different from the smaller tides raised in Earth's oceans. A large tidal wave swept across the sun's surface, eventually forming an enormous mountain beyond our imagination. The closeness of the wandering star meant that the tidal forces at play were strong enough to cause the mountain's immense growth. As the wandering star began to move away, its tidal pull reached its peak power, tearing the mountain apart and ejecting small pieces of itself into space. These fragments have been orbiting the sun ever since, forming the planets that are part of our solar system. In summary, it is believed that the mountain on the sun was raised primarily because another star happened to come near the sun (option B). This event led to the immense tidal forces that ultimately resulted in the formation of planets, shaping the solar system we know today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press) EgyptAir hostesses line up during a candlelight vigil for the victims of EgyptAir flight 804 in Cairo, Egypt, Thursday, May 26, 2016. The cause of Thursday's crash of the EgyptAir jet flying from Paris to Cairo that killed all 66 people aboard still has not been determined. Ships and planes from Egypt,... (Associated Press) CAIRO (AP) — A French vessel that joined the search for the EgyptAir plane which crashed last week killing all 66 people on board arrived Friday in the crash area, as Egyptian officials said search teams in the Mediterranean have picked up a beacon believed to be from the doomed aircraft. According to Egyptian security officials, the French ship is carrying equipment that can find flight data and cockpit voice recorders — the so-called \\"black boxes.\\" French officials could not be immediately reached to confirm the ship's whereabouts. Meanwhile, the chief investigator in Egypt said search teams in the Mediterranean have picked up a beacon believed to be from the EgyptAir Flight 804. Locating a beacon has narrowed the search to a 5 kilometer (3 mile) radius, said Ayman al-Moqadem, stressing that this doesn't mean the black boxes have been found, which he said requires highly sophisticated technology. The signal that was picked up came from one of the devices on the plane transmitting its location, said al-Moqadem, who spoke to reporters on Thursday. Eight days after the plane crashed off Egypt's northern coast on a Paris to Cairo flight, the cause of the tragedy still has not been determined. Ships and planes from Egypt, Greece, France, the United States and other nations have been searching the Mediterranean north of the Egyptian port of Alexandria for the jet's voice and flight data recorders, as well as more bodies and parts of the aircraft. Small pieces of the wreckage and human remains have already been recovered while the bulk of the plane and the bodies of the passengers are believed to be deep under the sea. A Cairo forensic team has received the human remains and is carrying DNA tests to identify the victims. Egypt's civil aviation minister Sherif Fathi has said he believes terrorism is a more likely explanation than equipment failure or some other catastrophic event. But no hard evidence has emerged on the cause, and no militant group has claimed to have downed the jet. Earlier, leaked flight data indicated a sensor detected smoke in a lavatory and a fault in two of the plane's cockpit windows in the final moments of the flight. The French air accident investigation agency, the BEA, said in a statement that the Laplace ship left Thursday from Corsica for the zone of the crash, with two BEA investigators aboard. The Laplace is equipped with three detectors made by the Alseamar company designed to detect and localize signals from the flight recorders, believed about 3,000 meters (3,280 yards) underwater. France may also send an unmanned submarine and deep-sea retrieval equipment, the statement said. The BEA is involved in the search because the crashed plane was an Airbus, manufactured in France. Because of the difficulties in finding the black boxes, Egypt has contracted two foreign companies to help locate the flight data recorders of the plane. One of the companies is Alseamar, which has equipment aboard the French vessel. Egyptian official have said the second company is called Deep Ocean Search. Also, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said earlier that a submarine would join the search for the plane's data recorders. However, al-Moqadem told reporters that the submarine is not equipped to detect signals from the black boxes. All Egyptian officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information. ||||| Image copyright Egyptian Military/Reuters Image caption Debris from the plane has been recovered from the sea north of the Egyptian coast A French naval ship specialising in underwater searches is on its way to help find the flight recorders of an EgyptAir plane that crashed last week. On Thursday, Egypt's chief investigator said the search had narrowed to about 5km (3.1 miles) in the Mediterranean. This was based on a signal from the plane's emergency beacon, but officials now say the signal was received on the day of the crash and is not new. There were 66 people on board when the Airbus A320 crashed on 19 May. The plane was flying overnight from Paris to Cairo when it vanished from Greek and Egyptian radar screens, apparently without having sent a distress call. France's air accident investigation agency, the BEA, confirmed a naval oceanographic research ship, Laplace, is heading for the crash site. In a statement, it said the ship was due to reach the crash area on Sunday or Monday, carrying a long-range acoustic system able to detect signals from the black box. Image copyright AP Image caption Hundreds of people gathered in Cairo for a candlelit vigil for the victims on Thursday Egypt's chief investigator, Ayman al-Moqadem, had said on Thursday that a signal detected was from a beacon situated in the rear of the cabin on the plane which transmits its location. However, other officials on Friday told journalists that the signal was received on the day of the crash, and that there had been no other signals since. \\"There has been nothing since day one,\\" one official close to the investigation told Reuters. On Thursday, hundreds of people gathered in Cairo for a candlelit vigil for the victims of the crash. Among those on board MS804 were 30 Egyptians, 15 French citizens, two Iraqis, two Canadians and citizens from Algeria, Belgium, Britain, Chad, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Sudan. They included a boy and two babies as well as seven crew and three security staff. Debris from the plane has been recovered from the sea, some 290km (180 miles) north of the Egyptian port city of Alexandria. Media caption BBC transport correspondent Richard Westcott looks at the possible meaning of EgyptAir's smoke alerts Egypt's president has said that \\"all scenarios are possible\\", but Civil Aviation Minister Sherif Fathy said last Friday that a terrorist attack was more likely than a technical failure. Greece's defence minister said last week that, after leaving Greek airspace and before it disappeared from Greek radar, the plane abruptly turned 90 degrees left and then 360 degrees to the right, dropping from 11,300m (37,000 ft) to 4,600m (15,000ft) and then 3,000m (10,000ft). The Aviation Herald also reported that the plane sent a series of warnings indicating that smoke had been detected on board three minutes before it disappeared. However, an Egyptian aviation official denied the plane had deviated from its route, and that there had been reports of smoke. Sources from Egypt's investigation team told Reuters and Associated Press on Friday that no emergency signals had been detected from the plane since the day it disappeared. Such signals are too weak to transmit from underwater, although signals from the flight recorders may yet be detected. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A special French vessel has arrived in the search area where the EgyptAir plane crashed last week, which killed all 66 people on board.

A retired Marine with nearly two decades of aviation experience has stepped forward with a compelling theory about a mysterious plane that was spotted flying over Texas last month. On March 10, photographers Steve Douglass and Dean Muskett took pictures of three puzzling aircraft flying over Amarillo, and posted them online in hopes of identifying the planes. Retired-Marine James Vineyard has submitted one of the more interesting explanations, telling the Houston Chronicle he believes they are SR-72 Blackbirds - a spy plane that can cross the U.S. in less than an hour, unmanned. The triangle over Texas: Two photographers captured this mysterious object flying over Texas last month. Mystery solved? A retired Marine says the plane pictured in Amarillo last month is the SR-72 Blackbird - a plane designed to cross the country in less than an hour. The mystery aircraft seen over Amarillo on March 10. Three of the craft were spotted flying by. In 1956, British magazines started. getting eyewitness accounts and grainy photos of the Lockheed U-2, then. operating out of RAF Lakenheath on its first spy flights over the Soviet. Union - marking the first sight of a stealth plane that government's. had hoped to keep secret from prying eyes. It provided day and night, very high-altitude (70,000 feet / 21,000 m), all-weather intelligence gathering. Vineyard spent 17 years as a Marine and also worked with a jet squadron in Arizona. He. says the Pentagon may have dispatched the planes to the Indian Ocean to. aide in the search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370. But Douglass, who saw the planes himself, doesn't agree. 'The. SR-72 is still in development,' he said Tuesday. 'Plus it's a. high-speed, high-Mach plane. These were going airliner speed. They were. not in a hurry to get anywhere.' The. SR-72 is currently being developed by Lockheed Martin in California,. and according to the company's website they say the plane could be. operational as early as 2030. It. is the predecessor of the SR-71 which broke speed records when it flew. from New York to Lonton in less than two hours in 1976. Lockheed. Martin's Hypersonics program manager Brad Leland wrote that the plane. is designed to 'strike at nearly any location across a continent in less. than an hour.' 'Speed is. the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next. several decades. The technology would be a game-changer in theater,. similar to how stealth is changing the battlespace today,' Leland said. Another source told the Chronicle that the plane was a B-2, but the two photographers discovered that no B-2s were flying in the country that day. The SR-72 is a successor to the SR-71 which broke speed records when it flew from New York to London in less than two hours in 1976. Another. reader who wished not to be identified told the Chronicle with. confidence that 'It's a B-2 stealth bomber flying out of Whiteman Air. Force Base in Missouri.' That's. what the photographers thought when they first saw the group of. aircraft, but they say they checked with the base and no B-2s were. flying anywhere in the U.S. that day. Instead,. Douglass believes that the planes are a no type of spy plane - a. stealth transport plane that could sneak troops into a another country. unseen.","completion":"This article recounts an incident in which three puzzling aircraft were sighted flying over Amarillo, Texas, and photographed by Steve Douglass and Dean Muskett. The key highlights from the article include: 1. The Photographers' Observations: On March 10, Steve Douglass and Dean Muskett captured images of three mysterious aircraft over Amarillo, Texas, which they later shared online, hoping to identify the unfamiliar planes. 2. The Marine's Theory: Retired Marine James Vineyard, who possesses nearly two decades of aviation experience, posited that the aircraft in question were SR-72 Blackbirds - unmanned spy planes that can cross the U.S. within an hour. This theory was shared with the Houston Chronicle. Vineyard drew upon his 17 years as a Marine and his time working with a jet squadron in Arizona to form his hypothesis. He suggested that the Pentagon may have dispatched these planes towards the Indian Ocean to assist in the search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370. 3. The SR-72 Blackbird: The SR-72 Blackbird is the successor to the SR-71, which set speed records by flying from New York to London in less than two hours in 1976. Currently being developed by Lockheed Martin in California, the SR-72 could potentially be operational as early as 2030. According to Brad Leland, Lockheed Martin's Hypersonics program manager, the plane is designed to strike at nearly any location across any given continent in less than an hour. 4. Contesting Theories: Despite Vineyard's theory, Douglass disagreed, stating that the SR-72 is still under development and hence could not have been in operation. Douglass argued that the airplanes were moving at airliner speed, not the high-speed associated with SR-72s. Another reader suggested that it might be a B-2 stealth bomber from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri; however, the photographers debunked this theory after confirming that no B-2s were in flight anywhere in the U.S. on that day. 5. Douglass's Alternate Theory: Douglass hypothesizes that the spotted aircraft may be a new type of stealth transport plane, designed to covertly transport troops into foreign territories undetected. This theory, while unconfirmed, offers another perspective on the identity of the aircraft. In conclusion, this article presents a real-life mystery of unidentified aircraft, with several theories attempting to explain their origin and purpose, with the truth remaining elusive."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Persian.

Q: Question: How long is the river in San Antonio where Jones drove cotton carrying wagon along the river? Passage:Walter \\"Wiley\\" Jones was born in Madison County in northeastern Georgia, on July 14, 1848. His parents were George Jones, a white planter, and Jones' slave, Anne, who had six children by George Jones: Matthew (who superintended the construction of the Wiley Jones Street Car Line), Thomas, Julia (wife of Ben Reed), Wiley, Taylor, and James (who managed many of Wiley's businesses). Wiley received his nickname because of his mischievous nature. At the age of five, he moved to Arkansas with his master and more than forty fellow slaves. They settled on the Governor Byrd plantation. George Jones died in 1858. Anne was called his wife in an 1889 biography of Jones, and she believed that George had promised to free herself and her children upon his death, but no manumission papers were found, and the family was kept as slaves and sold by the estate administer, Peter Finerty, to James Yell, a lawyer and planter in Pine Bluff. Jones worked as a houseboy and carriage driver for his new master. When Jones was ten, he was given to Yell's only son, Fountain Pitts Yell, on the occasion of Pitts Yell's marriage. Pitts was a state representative from 1860 to 1861. During the American Civil War, James Yell became a Major General of the Arkansas State Militia, and Pitts became a colonel in Company S of the 26th Arkansas Infantry Regiment in the Confederate Army. James Yell's was transferred to the Confederate States Army in the summer of 1861, and James left the service and moved to Texas. Jones served for Pitts during the war until Pitts' death in 1864 at the Battle of Pleasant Hill in Louisiana. Jones then joined James Yell and his family in Waco, Texas.

NFL Roundtable: Divisional playoff recap This edition of CBCSports.ca's NFL chatter covers the rise of Colin Kaepernick, the fall of the Broncos, and a look ahead to the conference title games. Follow our panelists on Twitter: Both. The Ravens' offence stole it from the Broncos' defence, who blew it. was all but over with Baltimore trailing by seven with less than a minute left in regulation and facing 3rd-and-3 at its own 30. Then Joe Flacco somehow completes a de facto Hail Mary to Jacoby Jones to send it to overtime, with the Broncos' secondary somehow letting Jones get behind them and somehow failing to bat the ball down in almost comical fashion. Run that play 100 times and I bet Baltimore scores a TD on maybe one or two of them. Broncos coach John Fox and safety Rahim Moore have a lot of explaining to do this week, but I'm going to give most of the credit to the Ravens' defence. Remember, this unit only allowed 21 points -- the other two touchdowns were due to special teams meltdowns. The key was the amount of pressure the Ravens put on Peyton Manning, specifically up the middle. It was similar pressure that flushed Manning outside the pocket before he attempted the ill-advised, cross-body interception in overtime. The Broncos also had three possessions in the two OT periods, but they never crossed midfield once. Baltimore defensive co-ordinator Dean Pees certainly earned his pay in this one. I'm leaning towards a steal here. Talk about a tough day for Champ Bailey in the secondary. One of the league's best at the cornerback position and he struggled immensely on Saturday. The Broncos had the chance to put this game away but they kept allowing Baltimore to stick around. But the shortcomings for Denver weren't all on defence. Late in the first overtime, Manning made the huge mistake of throwing across his body and his intended pass for Brandon Stokley up the middle ended up in the arms of corner back Corey Graham. That essentially sealed the deal right there. Kaepernick is getting all the press (deservedly so after that ) but the 49ers were a Super Bowl contender before their win over Green Bay, so I don't think this should change their status that much. The public seems to disagree: San Francisco is a 4.5-point favourite (already bet up from the opening line of 3) for the NFC title game at Atlanta. That's quite the swing from the divisional weekend, where Seattle (a team I consider roughly equal in quality to San Fran) was a 2.5-point underdog at Atlanta. I wonder if the public is crowning Kaepernick and the Niners a little too quickly. I agree, Jesse. The 49ers were Super Bowl contenders before Kaepernick even took the job from poor Alex Smith, mostly due to that suffocating defence. What Kaepernick adds is a duel threat that takes the burden off a receiving unit which relies too heavily on Michael Crabtree. It seems every week Crabtree catches at least six more balls than Randy Moss or Vernon Davis. If Kaepernick can continue to strike the right balance of passing and running, the 49ers should beat the Falcons on Sunday. Heck, if they play like they did against the Packers, they'll win it all. Sky's the limit I suppose. Kaepernick can run and now there is no doubt that he is the No. 1 guy under centre in San Francisco. Dom Capers and his Green Bay defence had no answer on Saturday night. None. Kaepernick can run the ball and throw it, especially to Crabtree, who had nine receptions, including a pair of touchdown catches. That said, he can still be erratic in the passing department and for that reason, I'm not ready to give the 49ers the NFC crown just yet. That's the narrative, but if Matt Bryant misses his go-ahead field goal try with seconds left (which he initially did, only to get another chance because Seattle's Pete Carroll did that annoying coaching move of calling a timeout just before the snap in a futile attempt to \\"ice\\" Bryant), then we're talking about the Falcons as playoff \\"chokers\\" who \\"can't win the big one.\\" Just shows you how thin a line NFL teams walk , especially in the playoffs. with the help of Carroll. Wow, when will coaches learn? I'm still not sold on this team. I see a lot of soft coverage over the middle, an area the 49ers should exploit. This game will come down to how well QB Matt Ryan can handle the extra passing load because I don't anticipate Michael Turner or Jacquizz Rodgers doing anything significant on the ground. It's a definite possibility. Once the Seahawks went ahead, we all had the \\"playoff choker\\" label painted all over the Georgia Dome. However, Ryan showed some poise on that final drive after making a couple of very questionable passes earlier in the fourth quarter. Yes, they blew a 20-0 lead at halftime, but they recovered and got the win. That momentum will carry into this Sunday when the 49ers come into town. Atlanta's pass defence has to be better, though. They gave up way too many yards in that department. Seattle's Zach Miller and Golden Tate combined for 14 catches and 245 yards. The probable return of John Abraham should help the Falcons' pass rush. I want to say it's big, but the Patriots just with Gronk out for most of the game, and I think they can take care of Baltimore without him. Much was made heading into this season about New England's unique two-tight-end offence, with the super-athletic Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez creating all kinds of matchup problems for opponents. That lasted about a week, with Hernandez going down with an injury and not returning until Gronk was out of the lineup (save for a two-game stretch in October where Hernandez tried to play but did not seem healthy). Still, the Patriots once again figured out a way to field one of the league's best offences, with an improved running game compensating for the injuries to the tight ends. As if we needed another reason to praise Bill Belichick, the NFL's best head coach showed us once again how good he is at adjusting on the fly. On any other team I'd say it's huge. However, New England has so many weapons that it's the one club which can recover from a devastating injury to one of the NFL's premier offensive talents. Don't get me wrong, who's amassed 39 touchdowns in three years is big, especially in the red zone. But with pass catchers Hernandez, Wes Welker and Brandon Lloyd -- and throw in running backs Stevan Ridley and Shane Vereen while your at it -- in the fold, there are no shortage of targets for Tom Brady play with. That's the beauty of Belichick: he doesn't rely on one guy to carry the burden. As long as No. 12 is under centre, the Patriots can win in any fashion. With all due respect to Gronk, it's not an enormous loss. Hernandez is fully capable of stepping up. He caught six of Brady's passes for 85 yards on Sunday. Hernandez filled the void in the regular season and he'll be able to do it again.

In the context of today's business environment, the responsibility of leaders in organizations has become increasingly significant. One of the key roles of these leaders is to foster a corporate climate that promotes and encourages the right actions, while working against those that may pose a threat to the organization's ability to grow and develop. A healthy corporate climate is essential for an organization's success, as it has a direct impact on the motivation, morale, and commitment of its employees. There are several factors that contribute to the creation of a positive and supportive corporate climate. Here are some ways in which leaders can achieve this: 1. Communication: Open and transparent communication is critical to establishing trust among employees and management. Encouraging open dialogue, welcoming feedback, and addressing concerns in a timely and respectful manner can contribute to a more inclusive and supportive environment. 2. Creating a clear vision and strategy: A well-defined vision and strategy that is communicated to employees can provide a sense of direction and purpose. This not only motivates employees but also helps them understand how their individual roles contribute to the organization's larger objectives. 3. Encourage innovation and creativity: Encouraging employees to think boldly and creatively can foster a culture of innovation, leading to the development of new ideas and solutions. Embracing and rewarding risk-taking can empower employees and drive business growth. 4.

Promote diversity and inclusion: By valuing and celebrating the diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences of employees, organizations can foster a more creative and innovative environment and promote tolerance and understanding. 7. Provide opportunities for growth and development: Offering employee training and development opportunities can help employees grow and advance in their careers. This can contribute to employee satisfaction and support the organization's long-term stability and success. 8. Maintain ethical behavior and practices: Demonstrating a strong commitment to ethical business practices and expecting the same from employees can help create a culture of integrity and responsibility. This can enhance stakeholder trust and loyalty while reinforcing the organization's values. In conclusion, it is crucial for leaders to take responsibility for the overall actions and behaviors within their organization.

The story takes place entirely in New York. Armando works part-time at his parents' restaurant and is also a custodian at a dance studio, where he secretly practices dance moves. He befriends the beautiful Mia Franklin, a dancer who is having a relationship with the studio's owner Daniel. She catches Armando dancing alone, likes what she sees, gives him a few tips, and they dance together briefly, but are discovered by Daniel. Trying to avoid an awkward situation, Mia leaves. When Armando realizes that Mia has left her scarf behind, he calls out to her from the studio's second floor window. On the sidewalk below, Mia turns to cross the street, when she struck by a taxi and rendered a paraplegic, paralyzed from the waist down. Upon learning of this, Daniel jilts her. Armando tries to boost her confidence and persuades her and other disabled people in the local rehabilitation center, including a \\"punky\\" Latina, Nikki and a wounded Iraq-war veteran, Kenny, (Morgan Spector) to enter a wheelchair ballroom dancing competition. Despite the opposition of his mother, Armando and Mia gradually fall in love and enter into a relationship, while Armando's uncle Wilfredo falls in love with Chantelle, a disabled trans woman at the rehab center. Before the competition, Armando's mother, who has been maneuvering to get Armando hooked up with the beautiful Rosa, does her best to undermine (even to the point of \\"casting spells\\") the relationship between him and Mia, which has become sexually intimate by now.

Given the question: Information: - Air Chief Marshal Sir David George Evans GCB , CBE ( born 14 July 1924 ) is a retired senior commander of the Royal Air Force . - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain. - Air chief marshal (Air Chf Mshl or ACM) is a four-star air officer rank which originated in and continues to be used by the Royal Air Force, where it is the most senior peacetime air force rank. The rank is also used by the air forces of many countries that have historical British influence and it is sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure. Air chief marshal is a four-star air officer rank and has a NATO ranking code of OF-9. An air chief marshal is equivalent to an admiral in the Royal Navy or a General in the British Army or the Royal Marines. In other forces, such as the United States Armed Forces and the Canadian Armed Forces, the equivalent four-star rank is General. - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved.

Help as much as you can. Article: Everyone hates to wait in lines. We get that anxious feeling that our precious life is slipping away while we're doing something so meaningless. But it's not always the length of the wait we find so unbearable. Some people camp outside Apple stores for an entire night just to get their hands on the latest product. But waiting 10 minutes in a grocery store just to buy a drink? Forget it. Our behavior when waiting is only partly decided by the length of the wait. \\"Often the psychology of queuing is more important than the statistics of the wait itself,\\" notes the MIT researcher Richard Larson. One apparent aspect of queuing psychology is that we get bored when we wait in line. This issue is solved in many ways, from magazines in hospital waiting rooms to mirrors in elevators so that we can check our appearance. We really hate it when we expect a short wait and then get a long one. But studies show that we are much more patient when we are given an idea of how long we'll be waiting. Walt Disney Co knows this better than anyone else. It posts estimated waiting times for attractions in its theme parks. But according to Larson, these times are overestimated so that visitors get to the front of the queue more quickly than they expect. It keeps them happy. But perhaps the biggest influence on our feelings about waiting in a line has to do with our sense of fairness. When it comes to queues, the universally acknowledged standard is first come, first served. Any departure from this principle is regarded as unfair and can lead to violent queue anger. You've probably experienced mild queue anger yourself in fast food restaurants, watching people in the other line zoom ahead of you, cursing yourself for having chosen the \\"wrong\\" line.

Question: Given the following context: Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person whose biographer was Michael Kennedy?

Possible A: desk, grocery shop, house, antique store, discount store Why is \\"discount store\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"The \\"discount store\\" as the answer to the question \\"Where do you buy a cheap book?\\" aligns with human common sense because a discount store typically sells goods at prices lower than those asked by traditional retail outlets. This correlation is primarily due to several factors including bulk buying, few replenishments, simplistic interiors, lack of advertising, and carrying overstock, discontinued, and irregular items. When considering the other options provided: desk, grocery shop, house, and an antique store, none are ideal places to find a cheap book in the traditional sense. 1. A desk is associated more with a piece of furniture and not a store or a place where books are sold. 2. A grocery shop primarily sells food and household items. While a few grocery stores may carry books, they are not traditionally known for it, and often the selection of books is quite limited, and the prices might not be regularly discounted. 3. A house is a dwelling place for living. While it may contain books, it’s not a commercial place where you can generally buy books. 4. An antique store refers to a retail store specializing in the selling of antiques, or the old and rare items. Books found in antique stores are often collectibles or rare editions, which are likely to be priced higher instead of cheaper. On the contrary, discount stores focus on offering a variety of products including books at reduced prices. Often, these discount stores carry bulk purchases or overstock items from other retailers or publishers that need to sell off excess inventory, translating into lower prices and discounts for the consumer. Therefore, consumers looking to buy cheap books would naturally lean more towards a discount store, thus aligning this choice with human common sense.

The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece.

Ripper (Sterling Hayden) orders the 34 nuclear-armed B-52's of the 843rd Bomb Wing past their failsafe points where they normally hold awaiting possible orders to proceed and into Soviet airspace. He also tells the personnel on the base that the US and the USSR have entered into a \\"shooting war\\".In the \\"War Room\\" at The Pentagon, Air Force General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) briefs President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) about the attack that General Ripper ordered. Although a nuclear attack should require Presidential authority to be initiated, Ripper used \\"Plan R\\", an emergency war plan enabling a senior officer to launch a retaliation strike against the Soviets if everyone in the normal chain of command, including the President, has been killed during a sneak attack. Plan R was intended to discourage the Soviets from launching a decapitation strike against the President in Washington to disrupt U.S. command and control and stop an American nuclear counterattack. Turgidson tries to convince Muffley to take advantage of the situation to eliminate the Soviets as a threat by launching a full-scale attack. Turgidson believes that the United States is in a superior strategic position, and a first strike against the Soviet Union would destroy 90% of their missiles before they could retaliate, resulting in a victory for the U.S. with \\"acceptable\\" American casualties of \\"no more than 10 to 20 million killed, tops... depending on the breaks\\".

Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - The Wurlitzer electric piano, trademarked the \\"Electronic Piano\\" and referred to by musicians as the \\"Wurly\\", was one of a series of electromechanical stringless pianos manufactured and marketed by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of Corinth, Mississippi, U.S. and North Tonawanda, New York. The earliest models were made in 1954 and the last model was made in 1984. Since then the Wurlitzer electric piano sound has been recreated on digital keyboards, and the vintage models are sought by musicians and collectors. - Supertramp (known as Daddy in 196970) are an English rock band formed in London in 1969. Though their music was initially categorised as progressive rock, they later incorporated a combination of traditional rock, pop and art rock into their music. The band's work is marked by the songwriting of founders Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson and the prominent use of Wurlitzer electric piano and saxophone. - Richard \\"Rick\\" Davies (born 22 July 1944) is an English musician, singer and songwriter best known as the founder, vocalist and keyboardist of progressive rock band Supertramp. Davies is the only member of Supertramp to have been with the group for their entire history, and has composed some of their most well-known songs, including \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", \\"Bloody Well Right\\", \\"My Kind of Lady\\", and \\"Cannonball\\". He is generally noted for his sophisticated blues and jazz-influenced progressive rock compositions and cynical lyrics. - Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz. - Keith Baker ( born 14 April 1948 ) is a drummer , best known for a brief stint with Uriah Heep . He played for Bakerloo , but left the group following the release of its only album . He subsequently became the first drummer of Supertramp ( then called Daddy ) between late 1969 and early 1970 . Baker joined Uriah Heep prior to their second album Salisbury , replacing Nigel Olsson . He recorded the album with the group , but left when he did not want to tour extensively with the band and was replaced by Ian Clarke . - Charles Roger Pomfret Hodgson (born 21 March 1950) is an English musician, singer and songwriter, best known as the former co-frontman and founding member of progressive rock band Supertramp. - Sir Elton Hercules John, (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight; 25 March 1947) is an English singer, pianist, and composer. He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin as his songwriting partner since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums to date. In his five-decade career Elton John has sold more than 300million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists in the world. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, including seven consecutive No. 1 US albums, 58 \\"Billboard\\" Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10, four No. 2 and nine No. 1. For 31 consecutive years (19702000) he had at least one song in the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100. His tribute single, re-penned in dedication to the late Princess Diana, \\"Candle in the Wind 1997\\" sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also composed music, produced records, and has occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford Football Club from 1976 to 1987, and 1997 to 2002. He is an honorary Life President of the club, and in 2014 had a stand named after him at the club's home stadium. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries.

Run the game.\\"","completion":"Title: How to Play Your Favorite Games with Virtual Drive and Imaging Software (An Easy Guide for Kids) Hey there, little gaming buddy! Today, we're going to learn how to play your favorite games without using the actual game disc. Instead, we'll use some cool computer tools called \\"imaging software\\" and \\"virtual drive.\\" Don't worry – I'll explain everything step-by-step, so it's easy for you to understand. Let's get started! Step 1: Choose Your Tools – Imaging and Virtual Drive Software To begin, you'll need to get two special computer tools: \\"imaging software\\" and \\"virtual drive software.\\" These tools help your computer pretend it has the game disc, even when you don't actually put it in the computer. You can find many of these tools online, and some of them are totally free! You can ask your parents or older siblings to help you find and install the right ones for your computer. Step 2: Get Your Game Ready for Imaging First things first – we need to create a copy of your game so that it can be used with the virtual drive. To do this, put your game disc into your computer, and then open the imaging software. This software will help you make an exact copy or \\"image\\" of your game. Make sure you save this image in a special folder, so you don't lose it. Step 3: Set Your Disc Image Preferences Now that you have your game disc image, you'll need to set up some preferences in the software. Don't worry – it's easy! Look for options like \\"image format\\" or \\"image type,\\" and choose the right one for your game. Some popular formats are \\".ISO\\" and \\".BIN,\\" but you can usually just stick with whatever the software suggests. Step 4: Set Up the Virtual Drive Next, it's time to set up your virtual drive. This is the pretend game disc drive that your computer will use. Open your virtual drive software, and look for options like \\"create virtual drive\\" or \\"add virtual drive.\\" You might need to choose how many virtual drives you want – just pick one for now. That's all you need to set up your virtual drive! Step 5: Mount Your Disc Image to the Virtual Drive Now that you have your virtual drive, it's time to put your game disc image on it. This process is called \\"mounting.\\" In your virtual drive software, look for an option that says \\"mount\\" or \\"attach image\\" and then find the game disc image you saved earlier. Click on it, and it should \\"mount\\" to your virtual drive, just like if you put a real disc into a real drive. Step 6: Play Your Game! You did it, little gamer! Now, all that's left is to play your game – without needing the actual disc. Go to your computer's game folder and find the game you just mounted. Double-click on it, and your game should start right up! You can play and enjoy your game just like you always do, and when you're done, simply \\"unmount\\" the game image from your virtual drive. And there you have it! You've learned how to use imaging and virtual drive software to play your games without the need for discs.

Write an article using the following points: Research finds drink is a recurring theme every nine minutes on terrestrial channels during the evenings. Greatest amount of alcohol imagery is between 8 and 9pm. Alcohol Concern call for appointment of alcohol advertising regulator. ITV and BBC both say they use fictitious brands in their shows.","completion":"Title: The Impact of Alcohol Imagery in Prime Time Television and the Need for an Advertising Regulator Introduction Prime time television, typically from 8 pm to 11 pm, has long been a critical time for television channels to gain viewership. As a result, the content presented during these hours dramatically shapes public opinion and viewers' habits. One recurring theme in prime time television is the prevalence of alcohol imagery, which appears every nine minutes on terrestrial channels. This tendency sparks concerns and raises the question of whether an advertising regulator for alcohol should be appointed to minimize its potential negative consequences on society. In this article, we delve into the frequency of alcohol encounters on TV, the potential risks it poses, and the possible solution of implementing an alcohol advertising regulator. Frequency of Alcohol Imagery in Prime Time Television Recent research reveals that alcohol imagery is a dominant theme, particularly between 8 and 9 pm. The portrayal of alcohol during this time often appears in the form of advertisements, characters consuming alcoholic drinks, or having alcohol present in various scenes. Both ITV and BBC have mentioned that they use fictitious brands in their shows to portray alcohol consumption. However, this does not change the fact that the subject of alcohol remains prevalent, inevitably influencing viewers' perception of alcoholic beverages. Potential Risks Posed by Pervasive Alcohol Imagery The prominent display of alcohol in prime time television can lead to the normalization of drinking habits among viewers and, specifically, young and impressionable audiences. Consequently, it may perpetuate a culture of excessive drinking, leading to numerous health risks such as liver disease, addiction, and mental health issues. Furthermore, the glamorization of alcohol in TV shows could trigger individuals struggling with alcohol use disorder, making it increasingly difficult for them to overcome their addiction. Apart from health risks, excessive exposure to alcohol imagery on television may also impact viewers' social behavior. Drinking behaviors presented on television often include partying, building social connections, and unwinding after a long day. The fact that these associations are not inherently negative may contribute to people perceiving alcohol consumption as a widely accepted and expected cultural norm. This view could potentially undermine ongoing efforts to address alcohol-related risks and hinder public health campaigns to promote responsible drinking. The Need for an Alcohol Advertising Regulator Due to the pervasiveness of alcohol imagery on prime time television and its potential adverse effects on society, it is crucial that an alcohol advertising regulator be appointed to ensure responsible practices. Entities like Alcohol Concern have already called for the appointment of such a regulator, which would serve to protect viewers by providing guidelines, monitoring compliance, and imposing penalties in cases of infringement. An advertising regulator could impose restrictions on the frequency and timing of alcohol advertisements, ensuring that they only appear during late-night programming or on channels with predominantly adult viewership. The regulator could also enforce content requirements, such as avoiding glamorization or excessive alcohol consumption and including messages promoting responsible drinking in advertising materials. Additionally, the regulator would also oversee the portrayal of alcohol in scripted TV shows, ensuring that the use of alcohol is justified by the plot and does not inadvertently promote harmful drinking behaviors. Conclusion The high frequency of alcohol imagery on prime time television raises concerns about its potential impact on viewers' attitudes and behaviors towards alcohol consumption. With alcohol use disorder and its related problems remaining pressing public health concerns, it is essential to implement strong regulations that address the portrayal of alcohol on television. The appointment of an alcohol advertising regulator offers a viable solution, fostering a responsible approach to the portrayal of alcohol and promoting a more mindful society in terms of alcohol consumption."},{"prompt":"Teacher:Given an Amazon review, indicate whether it is a 'Positive Review' or 'Negative Review'.

Movie title: Sex and Death 101 Movie plot: Roderick Blank (Simon Baker) is a successful young businessman with a great job as an executive for \\"Swallows\\", a high end fast food restaurant chain, and a beautiful fiancÃ©e, Fiona Wormwood (Julie Bowen). On the day of his bachelor party, he is e-mailed a list of all the women he has slept with. Strangely, while the list has 101 names, his fiancÃ©e is only number 29. He assumes the list is a prank, courtesy of his best friends Zack (Neil Flynn) and Lester (Dash Mihok)âuntil he meets number 30, Carlotta Valdez, who is the stripper at his bachelor party. After sleeping with Carlotta, he realizes the list does, in fact, comprise all of his sexual partners, both past and future. Roderick cancels his upcoming wedding and begins to sequentially bed all the people on the list. Although he makes a connection with some of the women, he is unable to settle down and is compelled to continue until he has crossed all names off the list. His friends become concerned for his mental well being and convince him to bury the list. Before he does that, he sees only part of the next name, including \\"Dr.\\" and the first few letters. He falls for Lester's charming and quirky veterinarian (Leslie Bibb), after believing she is the next name on the list and finding they have much in common, only to discover that she does not return his feelings, and wants to be \\"just friends\\". He digs up the list and discovers she was not listed, after which she has an untimely accidental death. He continues on his mission. Throughout all this, a female vigilante, nicknamed by the media \\"Death Nell\\" (Winona Ryder), has been taking revenge on men who she feels have taken sexual advantage of women. She seduces these men and then drugs them to induce a coma, leaving them behind along with a line of feminist poetry spray painted on the wall or ceiling.

Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided review, I would recommend this app to a friend with a \\"Maybe\\" response. The review presents positive aspects of the app, claiming that it is \\"much much better than WhatsApp,\\" which is a popular and widely-used messaging platform. This statement could imply that the app has useful features, a more user-friendly interface, or other enhancements that give it an advantage over WhatsApp. However, the reviewer pointed out that the app does not support end-to-end encryption for group chats. End-to-end encryption is a vital security feature that ensures the privacy of users' messages, shielding the contents from potential hackers or other malicious actors. By not offering this security feature for group chats, the app raises legitimate concerns regarding the protection of users' private conversations, which could be a significant deterrent for friends who prioritize their privacy and security while using messaging apps. Thus, the recommendation of \\"Maybe\\" reflects the balance of the positive and negative aspects presented in the review.

He picks up an acid solution that he labels as solution A. To compare it with another solution he chooses a solution that is not an acid. He labels it as solution B. Hint: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar? Like other acids, it tastes sour. Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms. For example, stomach acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of mucus. Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass. A:","completion":"Solution B has a higher pH value.

Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week.

Tears also enable us to understand our emotions better; sometimes we don't even know we're very sad until we cry. We learn about our emotions through crying, and then we can deal with them. Just as crying can be healthy, not crying - holding back tears of anger, pain or suffering - can be bad for physical health.

While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack.

Context: North Korea’s release of three U.S. citizens may help pave the way for talks between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, but questions remain as to whether those talks will succeed. At the White House on Wednesday, Trump continued to speak cautiously about the coming summit, even while praising the North Korean leader for the prisoner release. “Everything can be scuttled,” Trump told reporters. “A lot of things can happen — a lot of good things can happen, [and] a lot of bad things can happen.” North Korea on Wednesday granted amnesty to three Americans of Korean descent. They had been accused of espionage or trying to overthrow the government, charges widely seen as bogus. Pyongyang has detained at least 16 Americans over the past two decades, often attempting to use them as bargaining chips. All were eventually released, although Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old college student, died shortly after returning to the United States last year. A White House statement Wednesday praised North Korea’s latest prisoner release as a “positive gesture of goodwill” ahead of the Trump-Kim summit, which is expected to take place as soon as next month. South Korea’s presidential office said Pyongyang’s decision was a “very positive” sign for a successful North Korea-U.S. meeting. The freeing of the prisoners coincided with a visit to Pyongyang by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who declined to say whether the release was a U.S. precondition for holding talks with the North. “I don’t know the answer to that,” Pompeo told reporters on the flight home. “It would have been more difficult [had the prisoners not been released]. ... I’m glad that we don’t have to confront that.” It’s not clear what, if anything, the U.S. gave up in exchange for the prisoners. It’s not even clear a concession was needed, since North Korea has for decades sought the presumed legitimacy provided by a summit with a sitting U.S. president. Question: after the story ends does Pyongyang take more prisoners?

Find the work done by B in one day: B can do the work in 8 days, so B does 1/8 of the work in one day. 3. Find the combined work of A and B in one day: (1/6) + (1/8) = (8 + 6)/48 = 14/48 = 7/24 A and B together complete 7/24 of the work in one day. Now we know that A, B, and C together complete the work in 3 days. 4. Find the work done by A, B, and C together in one day: Since they complete the work in 3 days, they do 1/3 of the work in one day. 5. Find the work done by C alone in one day: To find the work done by C alone, subtract the combined work of A and B from the total work of A, B, and C: (1/3) - (7/24) = (8 - 7)/24 = 1/24 C completes 1/24 of the work in one day. Now, let's calculate the payment for C. 6. Find the total work done by C in 3 days: Since C completed 1/24 of the work in one day, C did (1/24) * 3 = 3/24 = 1/8 of the work in 3 days. 7. Calculate the payment for C based on the ratio of work done: Since the total payment is Rs. 3200, C's payment will be 1/8 of the total amount: (1/8) * 3200 = Rs. 400.

Polyester couches should have a tag, usually found somewhere underneath the cushions. The tag will have one of the following letters or letter combinations written on it: w, s, sw, or x. these codes let you know what kind of cleaners you can use on your couch.","completion":"After deciphering the couch tag and identifying the appropriate cleaning code, it is essential to follow these steps to clean your polyester couch effectively: 1. Gather the needed materials: Once you identify the proper cleaning code, gather the materials you will need such as a vacuum cleaner, soft brush, soft cloth or sponge, water, mild detergent, upholstery cleaner specific to your couch's code, a clean towel or paper towel, and a bucket or spray bottle. 2. Prepare the cleaning solution: If your couch tag has the letter 'W,' that means you can use water-based cleaning solutions. In this case, mix a few drops of mild detergent with water in a bucket or spray bottle until suds are formed. For 'S' and 'SW' codes, you can use a water-free solvent or a mild, water-based solution. It's best to use a specific upholstery cleaner according to your couch's code. The code 'X' requires vacuuming only and using any liquid cleaning solution is not recommended. 3. Vacuum the polyester couch: Start by removing the cushions (if removable) and thoroughly vacuum the couch to get rid of any dirt, dust, and debris. Use the vacuum cleaner's brush attachment to avoid damaging the upholstery and make sure to clean the crevices and corners properly. 4. Spot test: Before you start cleaning the entire couch, test the cleaning solution on a hidden area of the couch to make sure it doesn't cause any stains or discoloration. Wait for a few minutes, and if there is no negative reaction, you can proceed to clean the entire couch. 5. Apply the cleaning solution: If using a water-based solution, dip a soft cloth or sponge in the mixture and wring it out, so it's damp, not soaking wet. For solvent-based solutions, dampen a clean cloth with the solution. Start by gently blotting or rubbing the solution onto the fabric in a circular motion, working on one small section at a time. If using a spray bottle, lightly spray the solution on the couch and then wipe it with a soft cloth or sponge. 6. Deal with stubborn stains: If there are any stubborn stains on the couch, use a soft brush and the appropriate cleaning solution to gently scrub the stained area. Do not use excessive force as it may damage the fabric. 7. Dry the couch: After cleaning the entire couch, use a clean, dry towel or paper towel to pat down the areas you've cleaned. No need to rub aggressively; gently patting the couch will help remove excess moisture. If possible, open the windows or turn on a fan to speed up the drying process. 8. Vacuum again (if needed): If your couch's code required vacuuming only, give the couch another quick vacuum to ensure all debris is removed after the initial cleaning. 9. Reassemble the couch: Once your polyester couch is completely dry, place the cushions back in their respective positions. 10. Regular maintenance: It's essential to maintain your polyester couch by vacuuming it regularly, addressing spills and stains as soon as possible, and giving it a thorough cleaning every few months or as needed. By following these steps, you can successfully clean your polyester couch, ensuring its longevity and maintaining its appearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 29, 2018 ADVERTISEMENT The president's tweet, which did not cite any evidence for the claim, comes following a report from The Daily Caller citing unnamed intelligence sources who said that Clinton's private email server was compromised by the Chinese, a fact it claims was discovered in 2015. One unnamed intelligence source told the news outlet that Clinton's email server was compromised by a public company acting as a front for the Chinese government, which the source says inserted a line of code that sent a \\"courtesy copy\\" of every email to Chinese authorities. “When [the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General] did a very deep dive, they found in the actual metadata — the data which is at the header and footer of all the emails — that a copy, a ‘courtesy copy,’ was being sent to a third party and that third party was a known Chinese public company that was involved in collecting intelligence for China,” the intelligence source said. No U.S. intelligence officials have publicly confirmed the report, and it was unclear if Trump was making the claim based on information not reported in the story. China denied the report in a statement to Reuters, and said it \\"firmly oppose[s]\\" cyberattacks and the theft of state secrets. “This isn’t the first time we’ve heard similar kinds of allegations,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a daily news briefing. “China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity. We firmly oppose and crack down on any forms of internet attacks and the stealing of secrets,” she added. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

The Caller's report cited “two sources briefed on the matter.\\" The FBI and the DOJ did not immediately respond to Fox News early Wednesday for comment. It was not immediately clear if the president took to Twitter after learning about new intelligence, or was using the information from the earlier report. Trump tweeted earlier about the report, writing, \\"Are they sure it wasn’t Russia (just kidding!)? What are the odds that the FBI and DOJ are right on top of this? Actually, a very big story. Much classified information!\\" Trump has been a vocal critic of the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email investigation. He recently tweeted that “at some point” he “may have to get involved.” ||||| (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Twitter early on Wednesday China hacked the emails of 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton but did not offer any evidence or further information. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with the President of FIFA Gianni Infantino in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S. August 28, 2018.

Next move better be by the FBI & DOJ or, after all of their other missteps (Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr, FISA, Dirty Dossier etc.), their credibility will be forever gone!” he tweeted a little after midnight on Wednesday. Trump said in an earlier tweet on Tuesday night: “China hacked Hillary Clinton’s private Email Server. Are they sure it wasn’t Russia (just kidding!)? What are the odds that the FBI and DOJ are right on top of this? Actually, a very big story. Much classified information!” Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said such accusations were nothing new. “This isn’t the first time we’ve heard similar kinds of allegations,” Hua told a daily news briefing. “China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity. We firmly oppose and crack down on any forms of internet attacks and the stealing of secrets,” she added, without specifically mentioning Trump or Clinton in her answer. U.S. intelligence officials have said Russia orchestrated the hacking of Democratic officials to meddle with the 2016 presidential election. A U.S. federal grand jury indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers in July on charges of hacking the computer networks of Clinton and the Democratic Party. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Russia’s role in the 2016 election and whether the campaign of Republican candidate Trump colluded with Moscow. Russia denies meddling in the elections, while Trump has denied any collusion. Trump said in April 2017 China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the 2016 presidential election. He also did not provide any evidence backing his allegation at that time. China has repeatedly denied any accusations of involvement in overseas hacking attacks. China and the United States, whose ties are often fraught, are also currently in the midst of an increasingly bitter trade war. ||||| A Chinese-owned company penetrated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private server, according to sources briefed on the matter. The company inserted code that forwarded copies of Clinton’s emails to the Chinese company in real time. The Intelligence Community Inspector General warned of the problem, but the FBI subsequently failed to act, Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert said during a July hearing. A Chinese-owned company operating in the Washington, D.C., area hacked Hillary Clinton’s private server throughout her term as secretary of state and obtained nearly all her emails, two sources briefed on the matter told The Daily Caller News Foundation. The Chinese firm obtained Clinton’s emails in real time as she sent and received communications and documents through her personal server, according to the sources, who said the hacking was conducted as part of an intelligence operation. The Chinese wrote code that was embedded in the server, which was kept in Clinton’s residence in upstate New York. The code generated an instant “courtesy copy” for nearly all of her emails and forwarded them to the Chinese company, according to the sources. The Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) found that virtually all of Clinton’s emails were sent to a “foreign entity,” Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, said at a July 12 House Committee on the Judiciary hearing. He did not reveal the entity’s identity, but said it was unrelated to Russia. (RELATED: Gohmert: Watchdog Found Clinton Emails Were Sent To ‘Foreign Entity’) Two officials with the ICIG, investigator Frank Rucker and attorney Janette McMillan, met repeatedly with FBI officials to warn them of the Chinese intrusion, according to a former intelligence officer with expertise in cybersecurity issues, who was briefed on the matter. He spoke anonymously, as he was not authorized to publicly address the Chinese’s role with Clinton’s server. Among those FBI officials was Peter Strzok, who was then the bureau’s top counterintelligence official. Strzok was fired this month following the discovery he sent anti-Trump texts to his mistress and co-worker, Lisa Page. Strzok didn’t act on the information the ICIG provided him, according to Gohmert. Gohmert mentioned in the Judiciary Committee hearing that ICIG officials told Strzok and three other top FBI officials that they found an “anomaly” on Clinton’s server. The former intelligence officer TheDCNF spoke with said the ICIG “discovered the anomaly pretty early in 2015.” “When [the ICIG] did a very deep dive, they found in the actual metadata — the data which is at the header and footer of all the emails — that a copy, a ‘courtesy copy,’ was being sent to a third party and that third party was a known Chinese public company that was involved in collecting intelligence for China,” the former intelligence officer told TheDCNF. “The [the ICIG] believe that there was some level of phishing. But once they got into the server something was embedded,” he said. “The Chinese are notorious for embedding little surprises like this.” The intelligence officer declined to name the Chinese company. “We do know the name of the company. There are indications there are other ‘cutouts’ that were involved. I would be in a lot of trouble if I gave you the name,” he told TheDCNF. A government staff official who’s been briefed on the ICIG’s findings told TheDCNF that the Chinese state-owned firm linked to the hacking operates in Washington’s northern Virginia suburbs. The source was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. The company that penetrated Clinton’s server was not a technology firm and it served as a “front group” for the Chinese government, the source told TheDCNF. The Fairfax and Loudoun county governments told TheDCNF that 13 state-owned Chinese companies operate in the area. Of those, three were not technologically oriented. Fairfax County Economic Development Authority communications manager Seth Livingston told TheDCNF that all of the nine firms operating in his county were there in 2009 when Clinton began as secretary of state. “Our Asian folks believe that all of the companies have been around and known to us since that time period,” he said in an email. “This is the most combed over subject in modern American political history,” Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told TheDCNF. “The FBI spent thousands of hours investigating, and found no evidence of intrusion. That’s a fact.” “But in an age where facts are alternative and truth isn’t truth, it’s no surprise that an outlet like the Daily Caller would try to distract us from very real and very immediate threats to our democracy brought by the man occupying the White House,” he continued. Department of State Inspector General Steven A. Linick and then-ICIG I. Charles McCullough III scrutinized Clinton’s server in 2015. McCullough told Congress in July 2015 that her emails contained classified material. “IC IG was involved in the classification review of certain information drawn from the private email server,” an agency spokeswoman told TheDCNF. She declined to comment further. The two IGs asked the Department of Justice to investigate whether the classified information was compromised, according to a July 23, 2015, New York Times report based on unnamed senior government officials. The FBI issued a referral to the Justice Department in July 2015. The bureau warned that classified information may have been disclosed to a foreign power or to one of its agents. “FBIHQ, Counterespionage Section, is opening a full investigation based on specific articulated facts provided by an 811 referral from the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, dated July 6, 2015 regarding the potential compromise of classified information,” a July 10, 2015, FBI memo stated. An 811 referral informs the FBI of classified information that was potentially released to a foreign power or agent of a foreign power. “This investigation is also designated a Sensitive Investigative Matter (SIM) due to a connection to a current public official, political appointee or candidate,” the memo stated. Then-FBI Deputy Director Mark F. Giuliano sent a follow-up memo on July 21, 2015, to President Barack Obama’s deputy attorney general, Sally Yates, about two conversations he had with her about the criminal referral. “On 13 July 2015 and 20 July 2015, I verbally advised you of a Section 811(c) referral from the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community received by the FBI on 06 July 2015. The referral addressed the mishandling of classified information on the personal e-mail account and electronic media of a former high-level us Government official,” according to the FBI memo, which was hand delivered to Yates. Justice Department spokesman Devin M. O’Malley declined to comment on this story. Former FBI Director James Comey acknowledged in his recent book, “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,” that the FBI was conducting a criminal investigation into Clinton’s conduct. London Center for Policy Research’s vice president of operations, retired Col. Anthony Shaffer, told TheDCNF that Clinton’s server was vulnerable to hacking. “Look, there’s evidence based on the complete lack of security hygiene on the server. Fourteen-year-old hackers from Canada could have probably hacked into her server and left very little trace,” Shaffer said. “Any sophisticated organization is going to be able to essentially get in and then clean up their presence.” And a former consultant to the U.S. trade representative, Claude Barfield, told TheDCNF: “The Chinese were in the process of really gaining technological competence in 2009 to 2010. This begins to really take off in the early years of the Obama administration. The Obama administration was kind of late and there was this slow reaction about how sophisticated the Chinese were.” EDITOR’S NOTE: The FBI released a statement saying they had “not found any evidence” of an intrusion of Clinton’s server. The statement does not address a central aspect of TheDCNF’s reporting, which was that the ICIG briefed top bureau officials on three separate occasions to warn the FBI of an “anomaly” they found 30,000 in-bound and outgoing emails. Former Director of the FBI James Comey himself conceded in July 2016 that while the Bureau assessed the server could have been exploited, “given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence.” “It is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email account,” Comey concluded. According to two independent sources, ICIG found such evidence and briefed the FBI on it three times. After releasing the statement, the FBI refused to confirm or deny to TheDCNF that such briefings ever happened.

For music lovers across the globe, this collaboration signifies a thrilling fusion of the past and present, set to reshape the traditional stage of the elite opera festival. For the uninitiated, the Bayreuth Festival is the zenith of operatic achievement in the world of classical music. Since its inception in 1876, the annual festival has drawn leading figures from the arts, politics, and high society to Bayreuth, Germany, in a glittering celebration of Richard Wagner's work. In this veritable Mecca of music, the composer's descendants continue to guard his legacy, setting a gold standard for performances of his revered productions. However, recent times have called for a new approach to preserving and promoting Wagner's work. And thus, in a bid to breathe fresh life into the Bayreuth Festival, the Head of City Opera has extended an artistic branch to Katarina Wagner, Richard Wagner’s great-granddaughter and the current co-director of the festival. The key objectives of this collaboration are three-fold: To diversify the audience, widen the reach of the festival, and promote a more inclusive approach to classical music. It is a well-documented fact that the fan base of classical music, particularly opera, has been predominantly white and affluent. Yet, in this landmark initiative, the Head of City Opera and Ms. Wagner join hands to break down these barriers through investments in modernizing performances, revitalizing stagecraft, and adopting more innovative visual designs. Moreover, the partnership signals a commitment to cultivating an environment where art is more accessible, affordable, and enjoyable for people from all walks of life. The collaboration has also unveiled ambitious plans for nurturing fresh talent, a move that will encourage young musicians, singers, and operatic professionals to participate and share their work on the iconic stage. A new mentorship program, backed by the Head of City Opera and Ms. Wagner, aims to provide invaluable guidance and support to those eager to forge a career in the demanding world of classical music. As the sails of change catch the wind, the legendary festival is expected to explore contemporary issues relevant to younger generations and create a fusion of social awareness through the emotive power of music. The partnership will focus on fostering greater dialogue and understanding among cultures, while staying true to the core of Wagner’s musical genius. In conclusion, the much-anticipated partnership between the Head of City Opera and Katarina Wagner is set to bring sweeping changes to the world of classical music. It marks a bold step away from a one-dimensional perspective, embracing instead the complexities of a global society while making space for the voices and visions of an ever-evolving generation.

She has a remarkable talent which may prove the survival of the human spirit after death, for Coral is a medium who draws the portraits of spirits who contact her. Coral, whose parents were spiritualists, was brought up in Harrow, North London, where she attended a local spiritualist church. She studied art at the local college, where she specialized in textile design. Even though, at the time, she wasn't very good at drawing portraits, she met a medium who told her she would be a psychic artist. She doesn't actually see the dead nor are her hands controlled by the spirits; instead she 'feels' them coming through. Early in her career she drew the portraits of 'spirit guides' from whom she had received help. These portraits of guides, who included Red Indians, nuns and monks, were remarkable, yet could have been attributed to the working of a strong imagination. She also drew portraits by holding on to letters that had been written by people who had since died. Coral says, 'I know exactly what to draw without thinking about it.

Answer based on context: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Panthers, the Cardinals flew to the Edward Jones Dome for a Week 9 NFC West duel with the St. Louis Rams. In the first quarter, Arizona trailed early as Rams QB Marc Bulger completed an 80-yard TD pass to WR Derek Stanley. In the second quarter, the Cardinals took flight as Safety Antrel Rolle returned an interception 40 yards for a touchdown, kicker Neil Rackers got a 36-yard field goal, rookie RB Tim Hightower got a 30-yard TD run, and former Rams QB Kurt Warner completed a 56-yard TD pass to WR Jerheme Urban. In the third quarter, the Cardinals continued their domination as Warner completed a seven-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin. In the fourth quarter, St. Louis tried to rally as Bulger completed a three-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt (with a failed two-point conversion.)

Write a summary based on this article: Garrett Haake / NBC Protesters marched down the beach in New York's Hamptons to demonstrate against the power of deep-pocketed donors over the political process. SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. – In one of the most sizable shows of force from protestors seen on the campaign trail in weeks, a group of more than 60 demonstrators – backed by air support in the form of a banner plane – staged a protest of Mitt Romney's third and final fundraiser here on Sunday. The fundraiser, at the beachside home of billionaire industrialist David Koch, was to cap a day of fundraising in New York's tony Hamptons communities that could bring in millions of dollars for the campaign's \\"Victory\\" fund. It marked Romney's return to the campaign trail after a week of vacation at his summer home in New Hampshire. Romney and his guests received a loud – and at times profane – welcome from dozens of protesters representing organizations from Occupy Long Island to Greenpeace, which largely blocked a section of Meadow Lane to shout, \\"Shame on You!\\" (and unprintable variants thereof). The protesters waved signs at those who attended the back-to-back fundraisers hosted by Clifford Sobel, the former U.S. ambassador to Brazil, and later, by Koch. It was Koch, whose net worth Forbes magazine pegs at 25 billion, who drew most of the protesters’ ire. Holding signs that compared the fundraiser's reported ticket price of 50,000 to their annual salaries or even life savings, the protesters decried the power of donors like Koch and his allies over American politics. When local law enforcement officially cleared the protest, the demonstrators decamped from the street and – in one of the strangest visual moments of the campaign – marched nearly a mile down the beach to Koch's house. Accompanied by a bass drum, horns and even a tenor saxophone, the ragtag band arrived at the stretch of beach behind Koch's house after a 20-minute walk, where roughly a dozen police, Secret Service and Romney staffers stood on the dunes that marked the line of demarcation between the public beach and Koch's private land, and told the protesters they could go no further. And so they stayed - chanting, singing, and waving signs as a plane buzzed overhead, pulling a banner that read, \\"Romney has a Koch Problem. MoveOn.Org.\\" While some protestors shouted obscenities as the security watching them from the dunes above (and from a Coast Guard vessel off the coast), this reporter saw no direct confrontations between protestors and authorities. The climax of the protest event came when the saxophonist, David Intrator, 55, of New York City, led the protesters in a spotty rendition of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" which most of the group joined, though some continued to chant slogans as they sang. ||||| EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. – In a caper that seemed made for the movies, two protesters were arrested Sunday after authorities said they tried to sail across a pond to crash a tony Mitt Romney fundraiser and hit a police boat.The water, it seems, was the only way in to the home of Revlon Inc. Chairman Ronald Perelman.Romney aides and Perelman staff armed with clipboards, along with local police, tightly controlled access to the circular road leading to the luncheon at Perelman’s estate — a property secluded among the pines off Montauk Highway. But the home is on Georgica Pond, and two men from Wainscott, a town that abuts the pond, saw an opportunity, authorities said.East Hampton Village authorities said David Fink and Simon Kinsella attempted to sail across the police line, ignoring orders from East Hampton Marine Patrol, and “subsequently struck” the police boat.Police said one of the men attempted to flee by swimming to shore; he was arrested on the beach.

I have a new situation: Margaret is a sophomore in high school who just started her Spring break. With a week off from school, her family is spending some time driving out of state to visit her grandma, Kathy, who has a cabin up in the snowy mountains. Margaret always enjoys spending time with her grandma because she has interesting stories and makes some of the best pie around. Also, they always go skiing when visiting the cabin so Margaret is excited for that. But I can use this background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. What is an answer for this question: Who would be more likely to get lost on the mountain?

He was first noted by history in 1661, as part of a diplomatic mission from the Don Cossacks to the Kalmyks. That same year Razin went on a long-distance pilgrimage to the great Solovetsky Monastery on the White Sea for the benefit of his soul. After that, all trace of him was lost for six years, when he reappeared as the leader of a robber community established at Panshinskoye, among the marshes between the rivers Tishina and Ilovlya, from whence he levied tribute from all vessels passing up and down the Volga. A long war with Poland in 1654-1667 and Sweden in 1656-1658 put heavy demands upon the people of Russia. Taxes increased, as did conscription. Many peasants, hoping to escape these burdens, fled south and joined bands of Razin's marauding Cossacks. They were also joined by many others who were disaffected with the Russian government, including people of the lower classes, as well as representatives of non-Russian ethnic groups such as Kalmyks, that were being oppressed at the time. Razin's first considerable exploit was to destroy the great naval convoy consisting of the treasury barges and the barges of the Patriarch and the wealthy merchants of Moscow. Razin then sailed down the Volga with a fleet of 35 vessels, capturing the more important forts on his way and devastating the country. At the beginning of 1668, he defeated the voivode Yakov Bezobrazov, sent against him from Astrakhan, and in the spring embarked on a predatory expedition into Daghestan and Persia, which lasted for eighteen months.

These proposals targeted multiple areas including consumer protection, executive pay, bank capital requirements, regulation of shadow banking systems, derivatives, and increased authority for the Federal Reserve. The goal was to revamp the financial system and reduce the risks of future economic crises. 1. Consumer Protection: This proposal focused on improving consumer protection in financial services. It aimed to establish transparency and fairness in dealing with consumers, prevent abusive practices, and create a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency responsible for supervising and enforcing consumer protection regulations. 2. Executive Pay: This aspect targeted improving corporate governance and executive compensation practices. The proposed regulations aimed to align executive incentives with long-term shareholder value, ensure that pay packages did not encourage excessive risk-taking, and provide shareholders with a say on executive compensation. 3. Bank Capital Requirements: This proposal involved strengthening banks' financial cushions or capital requirements to ensure that they have enough resources to absorb losses during economic crises. It was intended to make banks more resilient to financial shocks and help maintain the overall stability of the financial system. 4. Shadow Banking and Derivatives: The proposals sought to expand regulation of the shadow banking system, which includes investment banks, hedge funds, and various investment vehicles that operate beyond the reach of regulators. Additionally, regulations on derivatives, complex financial instruments that derive their value from underlying assets, were proposed to increase transparency and reduce systemic risk. 5. Enhanced Authority for the Federal Reserve: As part of the proposals, the Federal Reserve was to be granted more authority to safely wind down systemically important institutions, thus preventing the kind of disorderly collapse that characterized some major financial institutions during the 2008 financial crisis. In January 2010, President Obama proposed additional regulations restricting banks' ability to engage in proprietary trading, which is when banks trade in financial instruments for their own profit rather than on behalf of their clients.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Detailed Instructions: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Based on the problem statement, we have to retrieve the names from a Person table where the age is greater than 'engineer'. However, it seems to be a confusing problem as 'engineer' is not a number nor a known constant related with age. Assuming, engineer may refer to another table specifying a certain age, but without this information, it's impossible to make a perfectly matching SQL statement. Ignoring the confusing 'engineer' part and under the assumption that it refers to a specific age, the SQL statement would be like selecting names from the 'Person' table where the 'age' column value is greater than a specific value, and sorting these results in ascending order by 'name'. Here's an approximate solution: SELECT name FROM Person WHERE age > {age} ORDER BY name ASC; In this case, replace {age} with the integer value that represents the age of 'engineer'. Please provide more information about the 'engineer' part, with the specific age or how it is associated with the 'Person' table, in order to get a more accurate SQL statement."},{"prompt":"Q:- A mold spore floats through the air - The spore lands on a piece of bread - The spore grows hyphae into the bread - The mold forms a colony - Sporangiophores grow upward What might be the last step of the process?

Article: E-waste is fast becoming a serious problem around the world. This report will examine this problem and provide some possible ways to solve it. We live in a society that is producing and using electronics all the time. It is often cheaper to buy new products than to repair old ones. Also, through clever advertising, companies always encourage people to change their old TVs, mobile phones and computers for the latest models. E-waste is created when we throw away old ones. In the EU alone, about 8,700,000 tons of e-waste is produced each year. Sadly, just over 1,000,000 tons is recycled. Burying e-waste or burning it cause serious problems for the environment. Electronics have dangerous things in them. These things can then get into the ground or pollute the air when they are burnt. In recent years, _ . However, their plans are not always managed properly. Sometimes electronics are just sent to poor countries such as Ghana. Here they are often burnt in public areas, which is very bad for people's health. Setting up recycling centers is a good way to solve this problem. E-cycling centers could recycle the parts that can be reused and deal with the rest properly. Another way is to make producers responsible for their used products. This means that producers must take back old products which are no longer wanted. They should then make sure _ are properly recycled or reused. As for us, we should try to cut down on e-waste. Change electronics only when we have to. And don't buy a product just to have the latest model. E-waste is a serious problem in the modern world. Both producers and users must take actions and try to keep it to the smallest amount.

I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

Given the question: Question: \\"What is required for the zinc to completely corrode away by oxidation?\\" Context: \\"Zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away. A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate (Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2) forms as the zinc corrodes. This protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away. The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot-dip galvanizing or spraying. Galvanization is used on chain-link fencing, guard rails, suspension bridges, lightposts, metal roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"For zinc to completely corrode away by oxidation, several conditions and factors must be present: 1. Presence of an electrolyte: Like any other metal, zinc corrosion requires the presence of an electrolyte, which is usually water containing dissolved ions, such as oxygen and salts. The electrolyte facilitates the flow of ions, allowing the corrosion process to occur. 2. Exposure to oxygen: Oxidation occurs when zinc reacts with oxygen, so it must be exposed to an environment containing oxygen. This exposure typically occurs through contact with the atmosphere or other oxygen-containing environments. 3. Time: The corrosion process takes time, depending on the thickness of the zinc layer, the environmental conditions, and the concentration of electrolytes. As zinc continues to corrode, its protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate degrades, allowing the process to continue until the zinc completely corrodes away. 4. Formation of localized corrosion cells: Zinc usually corrodes uniformly across its surface unless there are differences in local electrolytes, such as humidity or pollution levels, which can create localized corrosion cells. These localized cells can accelerate the corrosion process, eventually leading to the complete corrosion of the zinc. 5. Breakdown of the protective layer: The zinc oxide and carbonate layer formed on the zinc surface provides protection against corrosion. However, if this layer is damaged through mechanical forces, such as scratching or abrasion, the underlying zinc can be exposed to the corrosive environment, leading to the eventual corrosion of the entire zinc layer. 6. Presence of galvanic corrosion: If zinc is in contact with a less reactive metal like iron or steel, it may undergo galvanic corrosion, where the less reactive metal becomes the cathode, and zinc becomes the anode, sacrificing itself to protect the other metal. This process can hasten the corrosion of zinc until it completely corrodes away. In summary, for zinc to completely corrode away by oxidation, an electrolyte, oxygen, time, localized corrosion cells, breakdown of the protective layer, and the presence of galvanic corrosion must be present. These factors can vary depending on the environment, application, and protective measures taken, such as regular maintenance and ensuring that the zinc layer is free from damage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Water from the ocean washes onto beaches in waves - The waves contain sediment from the ocean - The water and particles in it hit rocks and sand on the beach - The wind and current sometimes push the water and particles harder - Tiny parts of the rocks on the shore come off the larger rocks - The waves pick up sand and small rocks from the beach - The waves go back out into the ocean - The waves carry the new particles with them - Rocks and the beach look a little different. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose wave sizes decrease happens, how will it affect LESS erosion by the ocean. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of decreased wave sizes has a direct effect on the process of coastal erosion by the ocean. The reduction in wave sizes would lead to a lower energy force being applied to the rocks and sand on the beach by the ocean waves. As a result, the overall erosion process would be affected, causing less erosion to occur due to several reasons. 1. Reduced force of impact: As the size of the waves decreases, the force with which the water and sediment particles hit the rocks and sand on the beach would also be reduced. Larger waves typically have more energy and thus generate a more significant collision force, leading to faster erosion. Smaller waves lack the same energy and have a lesser impact on coastal rocks and sand, resulting in slower erosion rates. 2. Reduced sediment transportation: Larger ocean waves have a greater capacity to transport sediment and small rocks from the shore back into the ocean. As the wave sizes decrease, their transportation capacity is diminished, meaning that less sediment and smaller rocks are moved. Consequently, the process of erosion is further slowed down as there is less active transport of sediment and broken rock particles from the shore into the ocean. 3. Changes in wind and current strength: Decreased wave sizes might indicate a change in wind patterns and ocean currents in the area. These changes can directly impact the amount of wind and current energy applied to the coastal rocks and sand, which would lead to additional variations in the erosion process. The reduced wind and current strength would mean that the water and sediment particles are pushed less forcefully against the shore, resulting in decreased erosion rates. 4. Altered beach morphology: The perturbation of decreased wave sizes can also change the morphology, or shape, of the beach over time. Smaller wave sizes might lead to an increase in sediment deposition and the formation of different beach features, which could further affect coastal erosion rates. A more stable and sediment-rich beach environment could act as a buffer to the destructive forces of waves and slow down rock erosion at the shoreline. Indirectly, if the reduction in wave sizes is significant enough, it might even alter the broader coastal ecosystems and human activities in the area. These changes could impact the availability of resources, such as sand for construction or shellfish for food, which might prompt human intervention to manage erosion or coastal processes differently. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of decreased wave sizes has both direct and indirect effects on the process of coastal erosion by the ocean. The key mechanisms through which these effects manifest include the reduction in impact force, sediment transportation, and changes in wind and current strengths. These factors ultimately contribute to less erosion by the ocean and can have broader implications for the coastal environment and human activities."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Feldshuh recently passed the 400performance mark Off-Broadway and at the Helen Hayes Theater, and plans to perform the role in the U.K. sometime next year. But she may have created an international incident with her controversial comments. \\"I'm taking the play to London, which in itself is an act of courage - it's a pit of anti-Semitism,\\" Feldshuh told several hundred women, including her 93-year-old mother, Lily, on hand to screen a short documentary, \\"The Journey to Golda's Balcony,\\" and raise money for the Museum of Jewish Heritage. A spokesman for the British Embassy in Washington responded: \\"We would not wish to comment on a statement we haven't heard ourselves. But the U.K. is a diverse, vibrant, multiethnic and religious society. The government is absolutely determined to protect all of our country's citizens.\\" At lunch, the actress also took a shot at France. \\"I won't go to Paris, because I am too frightened to go to Paris.\\" When I repeated Feldshuh's remarks to a staffer at the French Embassy, she chuckled at first, but then grew serious. \\"Look, I'm Jewish, and I go to Paris and I never have any problem,\\" said the staffer, who asked for anonymity and stressed that her comments were personal, not official. \\"There is such paranoia here from people - like this actress - who don't know the situation there.\\" Adding that there are 600,000 Jews living in France, about 1% of the population, the staffer continued: \\"There are some problems, of course, but they are exaggerated in the media. ... She should come. She should not be afraid. You can't stop living because you're afraid.\\" Vanity Fair writer Marie Brenner, a pal of Feldshuh who attended the lunch, told me: \\"It's a mistake for her not to go to Paris.

Interviewer Katherine Ozment can't resist writing: \\"She affectionately touches his arm every so often, watches him adoringly when he speaks, and calls him 'honey.' \\" Ozment then asks if they're planning to spawn - causing the couple to \\"pause and stare directly at each other for a full 15 seconds.\\" \\"That's one step too personal,\\" says Welch. \\"We shouldn't answer that,\\" adds Wetlaufer.

A:","completion":"Step 1: Assumption of the perturbation hypothesis In this step, we assume that less rain occurs that year, as mentioned in the perturbation hypothesis. Step 2: Analyze the impact of less rain on the formation of a stream or river With less rain, there would be fewer water sources contributing to the formation of a stream or river. This could lead to smaller or even no streams or rivers forming in that particular year. Step 3: Analyze the impact of less rain on erosion Since there are fewer water sources, there would likely be less erosion. Streams and rivers play a significant role in erosion and cutting into the soil and bedrock. With less water, the force responsible for eroding the soil and bedrock will be weaker, leading to less erosion. Step 4: Analyze the impact of less rain on the deepening of gashes As a consequence of less erosion, the deepening of gashes through continuous erosion would be slower. The gashes would not form as deep or as quickly as they would under normal rainfall conditions. Step 5: Analyze the impact of less rain on the drying up of the river With less rain that year, it is possible that the river could dry up more quickly due to less replenishment from rainfall. However, this would still depend on other factors such as temperature and evaporation rates. Step 6: Analyze the impact of less rain on the formation of dry ravines Since the erosion process is slower and the deepening of gashes is affected, fewer or smaller dry ravines may form in that year due to the lessened impact of the water on the landscape. Conclusion: The perturbation hypothesis of less rain that year does have a direct impact on the process of ravine formation. Less rain affects the formation of streams and rivers, the erosion rate, the deepening of gashes, and the formation of dry ravines. As a consequence, fewer or smaller ravines would likely form under these conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (August 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Abel Turner (Samuel L. Jackson) is a twenty-eight-year veteran of the LAPD. A single and widowed father, he is particularly strict with his two children, Marcus (Jaishon Fisher) and Celia (Regine Nehy). As his kids leave for school, the new neighbors begin moving in next door. They are a young interracial couple, Chris and Lisa Mattson (Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington), who are recently married and buying their first home. Chrisâs first exchanges with Abel have somewhat hostile undertones, with Abel making comments about Chrisâ smoking (which Chris hides from Lisa) and listening to hip hop music. The following night, Chris and Lisa have sex in their swimming pool. Unknown to them, Abel's children are watching. Abel arrives home to see this spectacle and is upset, so he repositions the home security floodlights so they shine into Chris and Lisa's window, keeping them awake. When Chris confronts him, Abel claims that the lights are part of his security system to prevent crime and says that it is a complex process to shut down the system and the lights. Abel attends a housewarming party hosted by Chris and Lisa. He is garrulous but has an edge, and criticizes Chris and his friends for their liberal political and social tendencies. He also exposes Chris' smoking to Lisa, as Chris has been discarding his cigarette butts on Abel's lawn. As he leaves, Chris tells Abel that he is starting to take offense to him, but does not plan to move. One evening, they hear noises downstairs, and find the tires of Chris' car slashed. They suspect Abel and call the police. However, because of Abel's status within the LAPD, the arriving officers are unable to do anything. Chris and Lisa have dinner with her father, who warns them that acrimony with a police officer may cause trouble. Chris buys his own...

According to scientists, the thought isn't as unbelievable as it seems. A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a sudden increase in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Professor Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemicals NSE and S-100B are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion . He said, \\"What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still significant. During sleep, the brain cleans poisonous substances off itself.\\" Benedict also said previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis could applaud his study. The rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep contributes to a loss of brain tissue, he explained. Benedict, whose study is published in the journalSleep, added, \\"In conclusion, the findings of our experiment indicate a good night's sleep may be critical to maintaining brain health.\\" A third of the UK population suffer from sleep-related problems, while the average person now sleeps for only seven hours a night, compared with almost nine a few decades ago. Many scientists believe irregular sleeping patterns lead to illnesses ranging from aches and pains to heart disease, while less than eight hours' sleep a night can lower the IQ the next day. Answer: NSE and S-100B will increase.","completion":"Question: Which chemicals have been found to increase in the blood after going without sleep for one night, indicating brain damage biomarkers similar to a concussion?"},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Information: - Papa John's Cardinal Stadium is a football stadium located in Louisville, Kentucky, United States, on the southern end of the campus of the University of Louisville. Debuting in 1998, it serves as the home of the Louisville Cardinals football program. The official seating capacity in the quasi-horseshoe shaped facility was 42,000 through the 2008 season. An expansion project that started after the 2008 season was completed in time for the 2010 season has brought the official capacity to 55,000. An additional expansion project aiming to close the open end of the horseshoe to add 10,000 additional seats was announced on August 28, 2015, with the goal of opening within 2 years. - The 2006 National Football League Draft, the 71st in league history, took place in New York City, New York, at Radio City Music Hall on April 29 and April 30, 2006. For the 27th consecutive year, the draft was telecast on ESPN and ESPN2, with additional coverage offered by ESPNU and, for the first time, by the NFL Network. Having signed a contract with the Houston Texans on the evening before the draft, Mario Williams, a defensive end from North Carolina State, became the drafts first pick. The selection surprised many commentators, who predicted that the Texans would draft Southern California running back Reggie Bush or Texas quarterback Vince Young. Ohio State produced the most first round selections (five), while Southern California produced the most overall selections (eleven). Twenty-seven compensatory and supplemental compensatory selections were distributed amongst seventeen teams; Tampa Bay, Baltimore, and Tennessee each held three compensatory picks. The league also held a supplemental draft after the regular draft and before the regular season. The 255 players chosen in the draft were composed of: - History. Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - ESPNU is an American digital cable and satellite sports television channel that is owned by ESPN Inc., a joint venture between the DisneyABC Television Group division of The Walt Disney Company (which owns a controlling 80% stake) and the Hearst Corporation (which owns the remaining 20%). The channel is primarily dedicated to coverage of college athletics, and is also used as an additional outlet for general ESPN programming. ESPNU is based alongside ESPN Plus at its headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. - Stephen Michael Tulloch ( born January 1 , 1985 ) is an American football linebacker for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League . He played college football at North Carolina State , and was drafted by the Tennessee Titans in the fourth round of the 2006 NFL Draft . - Mario Jerrel Williams (born January 31, 1985) is an American football defensive end for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL).

Movie title: The Vanishing Private Movie plot: Donald Duck is doing some camouflage painting on a cannon with yellow, green, and red stripes and black dots. Sergeant Pete sees it and scolds Donald, claiming that anyone could recognize it. Peter demands Donald to re-paint the gun to make it \\"hard to see\\". Obliging to the sergeant's orders, Donald walks off to the \\"Experimental Laboratory: Camouflage Corps\\" disregarding the 'keep out' sign (\\"It didn't say 'positively' \\", says Donald) and walks in. He finds some \\"invisible paint\\", which he tests with his finger and uses to paint the cannon. When Pete arrives, he is shocked to see that the cannon is gone, believing it to be stolen. But it is not stolen as the sergeant finds out the hard way by bonking his head in the underside of the cannon and discovering Donald inside. Angered that Donald painted the cannon too invisible to look, Pete blows hard into one end of the barrel, sending Donald into the bucket of invisible paint. When Donald runs away from Pete, the latter finds out Donald has become invisible seeing Donald's footprints on the ground. Donald swims across a lake and the invisible paint doesn't come off. Pete continues to chase Donald through a field of flowers, searching through the flowers, until he accidentally throws the flowers on Donald revealing his outline. Pete spots Donald and tries to catch him but Donald gets away again. The flowers give Pete an idea to find Donald. When the General drives up, Pete's antics, including jumping around a tree while singing \\"Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush\\" and throwing flowers, convinces the General that he is acting odd, especially after Pete asks the General \\"did you see a little guy that you can't see?\\" and the invisible Donald puts a cactus down Pete's pants, making Pete scream in pain and jump around like a madman and the General wonders what is up with Pete. Donald is running around a kitchen and then sees some pies in the window and Donald takes a pie and eats it. Pete then notices this and Donald throws the pie in Pete's face. Donald is skipping... Answer:","completion":"From the given movie plot for \\"The Vanishing Private\\", the character Pete holds the rank of Sergeant. Initially, he scolds Donald Duck for his inadequate paint job on a cannon, ordering him to repaint it so that it is \\"hard to see\\". This demonstrates his senior position in the military hierarchy and his authority over private Donald Duck. In the unfolding story, Sergeant Pete later assumes the role of a detective, tracking down Donald who has become invisible due to the \\"invisible paint.\\" This plotline illustrates that Sergeant Pete is persistent in his duty and takes his responsibility as a superior officer seriously, nevertheless, the narrative largely exploits this for comedic effect. Towards the end of the story, Pete's interactions with the General further highlight his military rank. He attempts to explain the unusual circumstances of chasing an invisible private to the General, but his antics only serve to convince the General that something is amiss with Sergeant Pete. In summary, Pete holds the rank of Sergeant in the army. His role seemingly ranges from overseeing Donald Duck's duties to attempting to maintain order and discipline following Donald's unintentional use of the invisible paint. It's important to note that the comedy is largely drawn from the absurd and chaotic situations that result from these circumstances. If you're considering investing in this film, it may be worth considering how much potential you believe this style of humor has to appeal to audiences, along with other factors such as production costs, potential revenue from different streams, and the track record of the creative team involved.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Curiosity is a sign of intelligence. It also indicates that you are eager to learn and improve. Work on developing this trait in yourself by simply making an effort to learn as much as possible. Don’t limit yourself to just focusing on your own role. Say to your boss, “I know I’m not on that team, but would it be okay if I sit in on the marketing meeting today? I’m really interested to know more about our upcoming strategy.” Keep up on new trends and innovations in your field by reading trade publications and following industry leaders. Let your boss know that you are actively looking for ways to improve your performance. Make it a point to regularly ask for feedback. Indicate that you’re not just looking for a pat on the back. Try saying, “I know you were happy with the report I turned in last week. But were there any suggestions you have? I’d love to do an even better job next time.” Your boss will appreciate it if you show that you are able to think outside of the box. When they ask for ideas in a meeting, don’t be afraid to speak up and suggest trying something new. You might say, “Let’s look into increasing our online presence. I know we’re a traditional firm, but more and more people are using social media for business purposes.” Don't take offense if your boss doesn't take all of your suggestions. Notice what sorts of ideas they respond to, and try to offer better ideas in the future. If you have a good relationship with your boss, it’s likely that they’ve done a few favors for you. Make sure to offer a sincere thank you when it feels right. For example, if they let you duck out of a meeting early to take your mom to the doctor, let them know that you appreciate the kindness. You don't have to go overboard with your thanks. A simple \\"I really appreciate your flexibility\\" will likely be appropriate. You can send an email or stop by their office to say this in person. Nothing is less impressive than lying. Make sure to demonstrate that you are a truthful, trustworthy person. Be upfront with your boss (and others) and don’t ever try to manipulate the truth. For example, don’t take credit for work you didn’t do. If your boss mistakenly compliments you for another team member’s work, make sure to say, “I actually didn’t have a hand in that, but I’ll let Beth know how pleased you are.” Work on being someone who can cooperate and compromise. Show this by being willing to work on a team. You can also help out co-workers with their tasks, and delegate responsibilities when it is appropriate. Don’t whine about others to your boss. If you have a legitimate complaint which affects work, of course you should voice it in a professional manner. You might say, \\"I'm having a little trouble managing Bob. He is routinely late to team meetings, and calls in sick at least once week. Do you have some thoughts on how I can get him to increase productivity?\\" If you're simply annoyed that your co-worker frequently tells you stories about their dog, you probably don't need to bother your boss with that. Showing up and slogging through the work day is not good enough. Demonstrate your enthusiasm for your job by showing some energy. Be ready to engage with others. You should also be willing to stay late or show up early as necessary. To give yourself an energy boost throughout the day, try taking a brisk walk over lunch. Set yourself up for success by getting plenty of rest, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Acting professional means treating others with respect. Use preferred forms of address, and follow office etiquette. This means no texting during meetings or leaving dirty dishes in the communal kitchen. Don't engage in office gossip. If others are gossiping, either change the subject or excuse yourself. Similarly, maintain a professional appearance. If your workplace has a dress code, make sure to follow it. Even if they don't, make sure that you look put together whenever you show up for work. Dress appropriately for your industry. Wear clothes that are clean, unwrinkled, and fit well, take care to keep your hair and fingernails neat and clean, and avoid wearing strong cologne or perfume. Summary:","completion":"Curiosity reflects intelligence and eagerness to learn. Develop this trait by seeking knowledge, attending meetings even outside your domain, staying updated with industry trends, and asking for feedback to improve. Be open to new ideas and maintain a good relationship with your boss, showing gratitude when appropriate. Demonstrate trustworthiness, cooperation, and compromise in your work. Avoid complaining unless it affects work performance. Show enthusiasm and energy by being willing to go the extra mile and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
