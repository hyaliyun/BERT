What is the remainder if the same number is divided by 15?","completion":"Let's call the certain number \\"N\\". According to the information given, when N is divided by 35, the remainder is 25. This means that N can be expressed as: N = 35k + 25 where k is some integer. Now, we want to find the remainder when N is divided by 15. To do this, we can substitute the expression for N into the division by 15: (N = 35k + 25) ÷ 15 We can break this down into two parts: (35k ÷ 15) and (25 ÷ 15). First, let's divide 35k by 15. Since 35 is a multiple of 5 and 15 is also a multiple of 5, we can simplify: 35k ÷ 15 = (5 * 7k) ÷ (5 * 3) = 7k ÷ 3 Since k is an integer, 7k will also be an integer, and when we divide an integer by 3, the remainder must be either 0, 1, or 2. However, since we are looking for the remainder when N is divided by 15, we can ignore the quotient of 7k ÷ 3 and focus on the remainder of the second part, which is 25 ÷ 15. Now, let's divide 25 by 15: 25 ÷ 15 = 1 with a remainder of 10 So, when N is divided by 15, the remainder is boxed{10} ."},{"prompt":"The numbers from 1 to 8 are placed at the vertices of a cube such that the sum of the numbers at any three vertices on the same face is at least 10.

Assume the smallest arrangement of numbers meeting the requirement is as close to the lower boundary of allowed sum (at least 10 in any triplet) while ensuring all other configurations still work. Here, let us assume simplex configuration that ensures balance and sum checking for all faces: 5. **Example Configuration**: - Let's use numbers 2, 3, 5, and 6 on one face. - Check the sum of any three of these numbers. - The sums: (2+3+5 = 10), (2+3+6 = 11), (2+5+6 = 13), (3+5+6 = 14) - All sums indeed satisfy the condition (each sum >= 10).

Consider triangles ( ADG ) and ( DBF ), both of which are similar to triangle ( ABC ) because the two lines ( DG ) and ( DF ) are parallel to ( BC ) and ( AC ) respectively. This similarity arises from applying the Basic Proportionality Theorem (also known as Thales' theorem). 2. Denote the radii of the circumcircles of triangles ( ADG ), ( DBF ), and ( ABC ) by ( R_1 ), ( R_2 ), and ( R ), respectively. 3. By the property of similar triangles, the ratio of the corresponding side lengths of similar triangles is equal. Consequently, the ratios of the circumradii of similar triangles also hold this proportionality: [ frac{R_1}{AD} = frac{R_2}{DB} = frac{R}{AB} ] 4. Given that ( AD + DB = AB ), we can combine the proportionalities to express the sum of the radii ( R_1 ) and ( R_2 ): [ frac{R_1 + R_2}{AD + DB} = frac{R}{AB} ] 5. Substituting ( AD + DB ) with ( AB ), we find: [ frac{R_1 + R_2}{AB} = frac{R}{AB} ] 6. Therefore, it follows: [ R_1 + R_2 = R ] 7.

The perimeter of the isosceles triangle is given as 13cm, and we are told that one of the sides measures 3cm. We need to determine the length of the base of the isosceles triangle. First, let's consider the case where the side measuring 3cm is not the base, meaning the isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length and the third side (the base) is different. If the two equal sides are 3cm each, then the base would have to be 13cm - 3cm - 3cm = 7cm. However, according to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. In this case, 3cm + 3cm = 6cm, which is not greater than 7cm. Therefore, this scenario violates the triangle inequality theorem and must be discarded. Next, consider the case where the base of the isosceles triangle is 3cm. In this scenario, the other two sides (the equal sides) must have the same length, and their combined length plus the base must equal the total perimeter of 13cm. Let's denote the length of these two sides as x. Therefore, we have: [2x + 3cm = 13cm] Solving for x, we subtract 3cm from both sides: [2x = 10cm] Dividing both sides by 2 gives: [x = 5cm] This means that the other two sides of the isosceles triangle are each 5cm in length, satisfying the conditions of the problem and the triangle inequality theorem.

Could it happen that the sums of all pairs of adjacent numbers are prime, and the sums of all pairs of numbers with exactly two numbers between them (i.e., sums of numbers on vertices that skip exactly two vertices in between) are also prime? 1. Let's label the vertices of the dodecagon in a cyclic manner as (V_1, V_2, ldots, V_{12}) and denote the number at the vertex (V_i) as (a_i). 2. We need to analyze sums of adjacent pairs and sums of pairs where there are exactly two vertices between them. Hence the required sums are: - Adjacent pairs: (a_i + a_{i+1}) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, 12) - Pairs with two vertices between them: (a_i + a_{i+3}) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, 12) Note that since the vertices are arranged in a cycle, (a_{13} = a_1), (a_{14} = a_2), and so on. 3. Each individual number (a_i) appears exactly in four sums (two adjacent and two with two vertices in between). For (a_i + a_{i+1}) to be prime and (a_i + a_{i+3}) to be prime, appropriate pairs need to be checked for prime conditions. 4. Consider the numbers 6 and 12 specifically.

However, there are fewer numbers (1, 5, 7,) and (11) than required to satisfy all conditions for both 6 and 12 simultaneously, also considering sums involving pairs with two numbers between them, it adds complexity to satisfy all prime conditions. 6.

Let's start by finding the prime factorization of 16800: 16800 = 2^4 × 3^1 × 5^2 × 7^1 For a number to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even. For a number to be a perfect cube, all the exponents must be multiples of 3.

Suppose G is a point such that BG = FG and the line through G parallel to BC passes through the midpoint of EF. 4. Note that for given E and F, G is unique. G must lie on the perpendicular bisector of BF, and the line through G parallel to BC also passes through the midpoint of EF. Therefore, G is the unique intersection of these two lines. 5. Consider translating triangle CDE to create triangle BAE'. Note that E', A, and E are collinear, with E'E = E'D + AD = AD = BC. Since E'E and BC are parallel, we can translate triangle BCF to create triangle E'EF'. 6. Now, F, E, F' are collinear. Also, E'F' = BF and angle E'F'E = angle BFC = 90^circ = angle BFE. Thus, BE'F'F forms a rectangle, with G' as its center. 7. Clearly, BG' = FG'. If we let the line through G' parallel to BC meet BE' and FF' at M and N respectively, symmetry gives E'M = FN. By translation, EN = E'M = FN, so the line through G' bisects EF. By uniqueness of G, we have G = G', center of BE'F'F. 8. To prove AC < 2 cdot FG, we calculate: [ 2 cdot FG = FE' = sqrt{BF^2 + BE'^2} > sqrt{2 cdot BF cdot BE'} ] Here, we use the AM-GM inequality. Given that BF < BC (because BF is a height in triangle BCE) and BC = AD < BE', we have the strict inequality. 9.

Since [XC] is the area of square ABCD, we simplify this to: [ sqrt{2 ([ABB] + [E'EFF'] + [ABFE])} ] 11.

Speed in m/s = (Speed in km/h) * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) Speed of train in m/s = 60 * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 3600) Speed of train in m/s = 60 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of train in m/s = 60 * (5 / 18) Speed of train in m/s = 16.6666666667 m/s Now, let's calculate the relative speed of the train with respect to the man. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to find the relative speed. The train covers a distance of 240 meters in 13.090909090909092 seconds. So, the relative speed (train speed + man's speed) in m/s is: Relative speed in m/s = Distance / Time Relative speed in m/s = 240 m / 13.090909090909092 s Relative speed in m/s ≈ 18.3333333333 m/s Now we have the relative speed in m/s, and we know the train's speed in m/s.

Man's speed in km/h = (Man's speed in m/s) * (3600 s / 1 h) * (1 km / 1000 m) Man's speed in km/h = 1.6666666666 * (3600 / 1) * (1 / 1000) Man's speed in km/h = 1.6666666666 * 3.6 Man's speed in km/h = 6 km/h Therefore, the speed of the man is boxed{6} km/h."},{"prompt":"The coordinates of the left focus of the ellipse begin{cases}x=4cos theta y=3sin thetaend{cases} (where theta is a parameter) are A: ( sqrt{7} ,0) B: (0,7) C: (5,0) D: (4,0)","completion":"**Analysis** This question examines the properties of an ellipse and the coordinates of its foci.

Thus, we have: [ A = frac{1}{2} times s times d_1 + frac{1}{2} times s times d_2 + frac{1}{2} times s times d_3 ] Simplifying this, we get: [ A = frac{1}{2}s(d_1 + d_2 + d_3) ] Since both expressions represent the area of the same triangle, we can set them equal to each other: [ frac{sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = frac{1}{2} s (d_1 + d_2 + d_3) ] Substitute the values ( d_1 = 3 ), ( d_2 = 4 ), and ( d_3 = 5 ): [ frac{sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = frac{1}{2} s (3 + 4 + 5) ] [ frac{sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = frac{1}{2} s times 12 ] Next, simplify and solve for ( s ): Multiply both sides by 4 to clear the fraction: [ sqrt{3} s^2 = 24 s ] Divide both sides by ( s ) (assuming ( s neq 0 )): [ sqrt{3} s = 24 ] Finally, solve for ( s ): [ s = frac{24}{sqrt{3}} ] [ s = frac{24 sqrt{3}}{3} ] [ s = 8 sqrt{3} ] Thus, the side length of the triangle is: [ boxed{8 sqrt{3}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the functions f(x) = log_a(1+x) and g(x) = log_a(1x), where (a>0 and a neq 1).

According to the information provided, 3 moles of MgO react to form 3 moles of MgCO3.

Here, (text{rad}(n)) is defined as the product of all distinct prime factors of ( n ). 2. **Analyzing the Range of ( text{rad}(n) ):** Since ( text{rad}(n) ) is the product of distinct primes dividing ( n ), we have: [ 0 < text{rad}(n) leq n ] for all ( n in mathbb{N} ). This implies: [ 0 < P(n) leq n ] for infinitely many ( n ). 3. **Degree of ( P(x) ):** Given that ( P(n) leq n ) for infinitely many ( n ), we can infer: [ lim_{n to infty} frac{P(n)}{n} leq 1 ] This implies that the degree of ( P(x) ) must be at most 1, i.e., ( deg P(x) leq 1 ). 4. **Case 1: ( P(x) ) is a constant polynomial:** Let ( P(x) = c ) where ( c in mathbb{Q} ). For ( P(n) = text{rad}(n) ) to hold for infinitely many ( n ), ( c ) must be a square-free integer (since ( text{rad}(n) ) is always square-free).

This is impossible because ( text{rad}(n) ) can take arbitrarily large values, leading to a contradiction. - **Subcase 2.2: ( b = 0 ):** If ( b = 0 ), then ( P(x) = frac{ax}{c} ). For ( P(n) = text{rad}(n) ) to hold for infinitely many ( n ), we need: [ an = c cdot text{rad}(n) ] This implies: [ frac{n}{text{rad}(n)} = frac{c}{a} ] Since ( frac{n}{text{rad}(n)} ) is an integer, ( c ) must be a multiple of ( a ).

The conjugate of a complex number a + bi is a - bi. So, the conjugate of 2 + 2i is 2 - 2i. The imaginary part of a complex number a + bi is b.

Here is how we can achieve such a partition: Step 1: Partition into Subsets Firstly, consider the set of perfect squares: ( {1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ldots, n^2, ldots} ). This set can be used as a basis to partition the set of all natural numbers. Step 2: Grouping Integers Using perfect squares, we divide the natural numbers into groups such that each group corresponds to the interval between two consecutive perfect squares. Specifically, the (k)-th group will contain the integers from (k^2) to ((k+1)^2 - 1). For example: - The first group will be: ({1}) - The second group will be: ({2, 3}) - The third group will be: ({4, 5, 6, 7, 8}) Formally, the (k)-th group can be defined as: [ G_k = {k^2, k^2 + 1, ldots, (k+1)^2 - 1} ] Step 3: Assigning to Two Subsets We now distribute these groups ( G_k ) into two subsets ( A ) and ( B ) in such a way that each subset will not contain any infinite arithmetic progression. One possible way to achieve this is by alternately assigning each group to one of the subsets: - Let ( A ) contain all groups ( G_{2k} ) - Let ( B ) contain all groups ( G_{2k+1} ) That is, for even-group numbers, assign them to subset ( A ): [ A = G_0 cup G_2 cup G_4 cup ldots ] For odd-group numbers, assign them to subset ( B ): [ B = G_1 cup G_3 cup G_5 cup ldots ] Step 4: Conclusion Under this partition scheme, neither subset ( A ) nor subset ( B ) contains an infinite arithmetic progression because the numbers are distributed across finite groups, and no group has a number sequence in arithmetic progression spanning infinitely across the groups.

Thus, we have [ sin(alpha+beta) = sqrt{1 - cos^2(alpha+beta)} = sqrt{1 - left(frac{3}{5}right)^2} = sqrt{1 - frac{9}{25}} = sqrt{frac{16}{25}} = frac{4}{5}. ] # Step 2: Find cos(beta-frac{pi}{4}) Similarly, given sin(beta-frac{pi}{4}) = frac{5}{13}, we find cos(beta-frac{pi}{4}) using the same Pythagorean identity. Therefore, [ cos(beta-frac{pi}{4}) = sqrt{1 - sin^2(beta-frac{pi}{4})} = sqrt{1 - left(frac{5}{13}right)^2} = sqrt{1 - frac{25}{169}} = sqrt{frac{144}{169}} = frac{12}{13}. ] # Step 3: Find cos(alpha+frac{pi}{4}) We use the trigonometric identity for the cosine of a difference, which states that cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B, to find cos(alpha+frac{pi}{4}). Here, we set A = alpha + beta and B = beta - frac{pi}{4}, thus [ cos(alpha+frac{pi}{4}) = cos[(alpha+beta)-(beta-frac{pi}{4})] = cos(alpha+beta)cos(beta-frac{pi}{4}) + sin(alpha+beta)sin(beta-frac{pi}{4}) ] [ = frac{3}{5} times frac{12}{13} + frac{4}{5} times frac{5}{13} = frac{36}{65} + frac{20}{65} = frac{56}{65}. ] Hence, the final answer is boxed{frac{56}{65}}."},{"prompt":"Let ( x, y, z ) be positive real numbers such that ( x + y + z = 20 ) and ( xy + yz + zx = 78 ).

Hence, at least one vertex of the square lies within the triangle. 3. **Case Analysis:** - If at least two vertices of the square lie within the triangle, then at least half the perimeter of the square is within the triangle immediately. Suppose the one vertex scenario is present: - If only one corner of the square is inside, the scenario implies three other vertices are partly outside the triangle. The corresponding sides of these two vertices are involved. 4. **Geometric Considerations:** - Outside each triangle corner's functional form is a right triangle piece of the square with legs (a) and (b) and hypotenuse (c). - Inside, the segments are (1-a) and (1-b), assuming the side length of the square is 2. 5. **Perimeter Calculations:** - For the external right triangle to account less than half perimeter, consider: [ (1-a) + (1-b) = c ] - With ( a leq c ), ( b leq c ) - Thus: ( a + b leq 2c = 4 - 2(a + b) ) - Leading to: ( a + b leq frac{4}{3} ) - This implies each corner triangle can account no more ( frac{2/3} ) of its perimeter outside. 6. **Conclusion:** - Summarize the internal segments' sum calculation: [ text{Internal Perimeter} = 2 + 3 cdot frac{2}{3} = 4 ] - Since the total square's perimeter is 8, proving: [ text{Less than half perimeter (( 4))} = 4 < 8/2 ] Thus, the geometric configuration indeed minimizes exposure to less than half the perimeter: [ boxed{4} ]"},{"prompt":"Points ( D, E, F ) lie on circle ( O ) such that the line tangent to ( O ) at ( D ) intersects ray ( overrightarrow{EF} ) at ( P ).

The points M, N, and K mark the points of tangency of the inscribed circle with sides AB, CD\`, and AD respectively. The center of the inscribed circle is I, and its radius is r. 3. We observe that BM=BL=4 due to the tangent segments from a single external point being equal. Therefore, AM = AB - BM = 6 - 4 = 2. Consequently, AK = AM = 2 by the properties of tangent segments from a common external point. 4. Since I is the intersection point of the angle bisectors of the trapezoid, it follows (angle DAB + angle ADC)/2 = 90^circ because AB and CD are parallel. This means angle AID = 90^circ, making triangle AID a right triangle. Similarly, triangle BIC is also a right triangle since I lies on the angle bisectors. 5.

Thus, IK and IL act as altitudes in the right triangles triangle AID and triangle BIC. 6. Since in a right triangle the square of the altitude (drawn to the hypotenuse) equals the product of the segments into which the hypotenuse is divided, we can compute: [ IL^2 = CL cdot LB = frac{1}{4} cdot 4 = 1 implies IL = 1 = r ] Similarly, [ IK^2 = AK cdot KD = 2 cdot KD implies 1 = 2 cdot KD implies KD = frac{1}{2} ] 7.

Now, let's calculate the total sales from the 150 set of knives per day: 5 houses * 150 = 750 Since he works 5 days a week, the total weekly sales from the 150 set of knives would be: 750 * 5 days = 3750 Now, we know that he sells a total of 5000 worth of products a week, so the sales from the first set of knives would be: 5000 total weekly sales - 3750 sales from 150 set of knives = 1250 sales from the first set of knives Since 5 houses buy the first set of knives each day, and he works 5 days a week, the total number of first sets of knives sold in a week is: 5 houses * 5 days = 25 sets of the first set of knives Finally, to find the price of the first set of knives, we divide the total weekly sales from the first set of knives by the number of sets sold: 1250 / 25 sets = 50 Therefore, the price of the first set of knives is boxed{50} ."},{"prompt":"the expansion of ({sqrt[3]{x}frac{2}{x}})^4, the constant term is ____.","completion":"To find the constant term in the expansion of left(sqrt[3]{x} - frac{2}{x}right)^4, we first identify the general term formula for a binomial expansion, which in this case is: [T_{r+1} = binom{4}{r} cdot left(sqrt[3]{x}right)^{4-r} cdot left(-frac{2}{x}right)^r] Simplifying the formula, we can combine like terms of x: [T_{r+1} = binom{4}{r} cdot left(-2right)^r cdot x^{frac{4-r}{3}-r}] [T_{r+1} = binom{4}{r} cdot left(-2right)^r cdot x^{frac{4-4r}{3}}] To find the constant term, the exponent of x must be zero.

Therefore, the angles ( angle APQ ) and ( angle ABQ ) hold the relationship: [ angle APQ = angle ABQ = angle ADC = angle ARP. ] 6. **Common Tangents**: The angle relationships imply that ( PQ ) is tangent to ( k_1 ) at ( P ).

Hence the sum of increments over any intervals is zero which is equal for black and white intervals. 3. **Increment Calculation for Linear Polynomial**: - For p(x) = x, the increment over any interval ([a, b]) is p(b) - p(a) = b - a. - If we break the interval ([0, 1]) into black segments ([0, frac{1}{4}] cup [frac{3}{4}, 1]) and white segment ([ frac{1}{4}, frac{3}{4}]): - Total increment over black intervals: [ left( frac{1}{4} - 0 right) + left(1 - frac{3}{4} right) = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{2} ] - Total increment over white interval: [ frac{3}{4} - frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{2} ] - The sums are equal: frac{1}{2}. 4. **Increment Calculation for Quadratic Polynomial**: - For p(x) = x^2, the increment over any interval ([a, b]) is p(b) - p(a) = b^2 - a^2. - For black intervals ([0, frac{1}{4}]) and ([ frac{3}{4}, 1]): - ([0, frac{1}{4}]): [ left( frac{1}{4} right)^2 - (0)^2 = frac{1}{16} ] - ([ frac{3}{4}, 1]): [ (1)^2 - left( frac{3}{4} right)^2 = 1 - frac{9}{16} = frac{7}{16} ] - Sum for black intervals: [ frac{1}{16} + frac{7}{16} = frac{8}{16} = frac{1}{2} ] - For the white interval ([ frac{1}{4}, frac{3}{4}]): [ left( frac{3}{4} right)^2 - left( frac{1}{4} right)^2 = frac{9}{16} - frac{1}{16} = frac{8}{16} = frac{1}{2} ] - The sums are equal: frac{1}{2}. # Conclusion Part (a): Thus, the partition ([0, frac{1}{4}] cup [ frac{3}{4}, 1]) for black intervals and ( [frac{1}{4}, frac{3}{4}]) for white interval is a \\"good\\" partition for polynomials up to degree 2. # Part (b) 1. **Analyzing Higher Degree Polynomials**: - To check for degree up to 1995, use the base case and induction. 2. **Inductive Step**: - Suppose we have a \\"good\\" partition for all polynomials of degree up to ( n ) over an interval ([a, b]). - Reflect this partition symmetrically over ( [-b, -a] ). - Adjust intervals accordingly to maintain the partition property if ( n ) is even or odd. 3. **Base Case**: - Base case for a constant polynomial is trivial as the increment is zero over any interval. 4. **Extension to Degree ( n+1 )**: - Consider polynomial x^{n+1} and observe symmetry: - If n is even, ( x^{n+1} ) is an odd function, - If n is odd, ( x^{n+1} ) is an even function. - Reflect the interval and maintain the modifications in color for segments. # Conclusion Part (b): Following the above approach by gradually increasing polynomial degree, it can be extended and hence for polynomials of degree up to 1995 will also have such a partitioning property. # Final Answer: [boxed{text{(a)} [0, 1/4] , [3/4, 1] text{ - black, } [1/4, 3/4] text{ - white}} ] [boxed{text{(b)} text{ Yes}} ]"},{"prompt":"order to effectively implement the double reduction work and truly reduce the burden and improve the quality, many schools attach great importance to students' physical exercise and hold sports competitions irregularly.

For f(x) to be increasing on mathbb{R}, we require f'(x) geq 0 for all x in mathbb{R}, which implies: a leq (1+x)e^{x}.

Analyzing g'(x), we find: - For x > -2, g'(x) > 0, indicating g(x) is increasing in (-2, +infty). - For x < -2, g'(x) < 0, indicating g(x) is decreasing in (-infty, -2). Therefore, g(x) reaches its minimum at x = -2, giving: g(-2) = (-2+1)e^{-2} = -frac{1}{e^{2}}.

The circles ( odot(C A_0 B_0) ) and ( odot(C A_1 B_1) ) intersect at point ( M_c ). 2. **Angles and Circle Properties**: Observe the right angles at the intersections: [ angle C A_0 O = angle C B_0 O = angle C A_1 H = angle C B_1 H = 90^circ. ] This indicates that ( CO ) and ( CH ) act as diameters of the circles ( odot(C A_0 B_0) ) and ( odot(C A_1 B_1) ), respectively. 3. **Projection on Line OH**: Since ( CO ) and ( CH ) are both diameters, the projection of point ( C ) onto the line ( OH ) simultaneously lies on both circles.

The probability computation for this scenario involves determining the portion of the uv-plane (where u = pi x and v = pi y) that satisfies the cos^2{u} + cos^2{v} < 1. The valid region is inside the portion of the unit circle defined in the first quadrant of the uv-plane. The total region possible for (u,v) forms a rectangle pi a times pi (1-a).

He also told Bob the sum of those 2011 distinct positive integers. From this information, Bob was able to determine all 2011 integers. How many possible sums could Al have told Bob? *Author: Ray Li*","completion":"1. Let's denote the 2011 distinct positive integers as (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2011}) where (a_1 < a_2 < ldots < a_{2011}). 2. The smallest possible sum of these 2011 integers is (1 + 2 + ldots + 2011). This sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first (n) positive integers: [ S = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] Substituting (n = 2011): [ S = frac{2011 cdot 2012}{2} = 2011 cdot 1006 = 2023066 ] 3. Now, consider the next possible sum. If we replace the largest integer 2011 with 2012, the sum becomes: [ 1 + 2 + ldots + 2010 + 2012 ] This sum is: [ S' = left( frac{2010 cdot 2011}{2} right) + 2012 = 2010 cdot 1005 + 2012 = 2011050 + 2012 = 2013062 ] 4.

Let ( O ) and ( K ) be the centers of the circumcircle and incircle respectively. The projections of ( O ) and ( K ) on the line ( AB ) are ( O_1 ) and ( K_1 ) respectively. 2. **Using Pythagorean Theorem to Express ( d )**: According to the Pythagorean theorem, the distance ( d = OK ) can be expressed as: [ d^2 = (OO_1 - KK_1)^2 + O_1K_1^2 ] Here, ( KK_1 = r cos gamma ), and because ( A ) has coordinates ( (s-a) ) and ( K_1 ) has coordinates ( frac{c}{2} ): [ O_1K_1 = left| s - a - frac{c}{2} right| = frac{|b-a|}{2} ] 3. **Calculating the Right-Hand Side of the Equation**: Let's now find ( varrho^2 + r^2 - d^2 ): [ varrho^2 + r^2 - d^2 = varrho^2 + r^2 - (varrho - r cos gamma)^2 - left(frac{b-a}{2}right)^2 ] 4. **Simplify the Expression**: Expanding the terms, we get: [ varrho^2 + r^2 - (varrho^2 - 2varrho r cos gamma + r^2 cos^2 gamma) - left(frac{b-a}{2}right)^2 ] Which simplifies to: [ = 2varrho r cos gamma + r^2 sin^2 gamma - left( frac{b-a}{2} right)^2 ] 5. **Incorporate Known Relationships**: We know that ( r sin gamma = frac{c}{2} ) and ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos gamma ). Also, ( varrho = frac{t}{s} ) and ( t = frac{1}{2} ab sin gamma ). So, rewriting: [ varrho^2 + r^2 - d^2 = 2varrho r cos gamma + frac{1}{2} ab(1 - cos gamma) ] 6. **Equating and Simplifying**: Equating the expressions for area from both sides: [ frac{1}{2} ab sin gamma = frac{ab r}{s} sin gamma cos gamma + frac{1}{2} ab (1 - cos gamma) ] Simplifying: [ (sin gamma + cos gamma - 1)(sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma) = 2 sin gamma cos gamma ] Using the identity ( frac{s}{r} = sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma ), we rewrite: [ 2 sin gamma cos gamma = (sin gamma + cos gamma - 1)(sin gamma + cos gamma + 1) ] This yields: [ (sin gamma + cos gamma - 1)(sin alpha + sin beta - cos gamma - 1) = 0 ] 7. **Solving the Final Equation**: a. The first factor ((sin gamma + cos gamma - 1)) is zero if and only if ( gamma = 90^circ ). Since if ( 0 < gamma < 90^circ ), then ( sin gamma + cos gamma > 1 ), and if ( 90^circ < gamma < 180^circ ), then ( sin gamma < 1 - cos gamma ). b. For the second factor ((sin alpha + sin beta - cos gamma - 1)), it simplifies as follows: [ sin alpha + sin beta - cos gamma - 1 = 2 sin frac{alpha + beta}{2} cos frac{alpha - beta}{2} - 2 cos^2 frac{gamma}{2} ] Further simplified to: [ 2 cos frac{gamma}{2} left( cos frac{alpha - beta}{2} - cos frac{gamma}{2} right) ] Here, the first factor is always positive and the second is zero if and only if ( |alpha - beta| = gamma ), which occurs if either ( alpha = 90^circ ) or ( beta = 90^circ ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{ gamma = 90^circ implies t = varrho^2 + r^2 - d^2 } ]"},{"prompt":"A positive integer n satisfies the equation (n+2)! + (n+3)! = n! cdot 1320.

The axis of symmetry for a quadratic function in the form y=ax^{2}+bx+c can be found using the formula x=-frac{b}{2a}.

When all three pipes are open, the cistern fills in 60 minutes. This means that the combined rate of pipes A and B minus the rate of pipe C equals the rate at which the cistern fills when all three are open, which is 1/60 cistern per minute. So, we have the equation: A + B - C = 1/60 Substituting the rates of A and B, we get: 1/60 + 1/120 - C = 1/60 To find a common denominator, we can multiply the second term by 2/2 to get: 1/60 + 2/120 - C = 1/60 Now, since 2/120 is the same as 1/60, we can combine the first two terms: (1/60 + 1/60) - C = 1/60 2/60 - C = 1/60 Now, we subtract 2/60 from both sides to solve for C: -C = 1/60 - 2/60 -C = -1/60 C = 1/60 This means that the rate at which pipe C empties the cistern is 1/60 cistern per minute.

By applying the triangle inequality to triangles within the convex quadrilateral, we get: [ AB + BC > AC quad (1) AD + DC > AC quad (2) ] Adding inequalities (1) and (2): [ AB + BC + AD + DC > 2AC S > 2AC ] Similarly, applying the triangle inequality around diagonal (BD): [ AB + AD > BD quad (3) BC + CD > BD quad (4) ] Adding inequalities (3) and (4): [ AB + AD + BC + CD > 2BD S > 2BD ] 2. Therefore, combining these results: [ S > max(2AC, 2BD) ] This gives us: [ 2S > 2AC + 2BD = 2D ] Dividing both sides by (2D): [ frac{S}{D} > 1 ] Upper Bound: 1.

Let us define the sequence ({a_n}) such that: [ a_1 = 8 quad text{and} quad a_{n+1} = 4a_n(a_n+1) text{ for all } n geq 1. ] 2. **Base Case (n=1):** For (n=1): [ a_1 = 8 quad text{and} quad a_1 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9. ] - The factorization of 8 is (2^3), where the prime factor 2 appears with power 3, which is at least 2. - The factorization of 9 is (3^2), where the prime factor 3 appears with power 2.

Here's the detailed proof using the concept of chains: 1. **Define Initial Injections**: - Let f: E rightarrow F be an injection. - Let g: F rightarrow E be an injection. 2. **Construct Chains**: - For each x in E, construct a sequence (chain) { x_n } defined by: [ x_{2k+1} = f(x_{2k}), quad x_{2k} = g(x_{2k-1}) ] - Three scenarios can arise for this chain: - **Loop**: The sequence revisits an earlier element. - **Infinite Chain**: The sequence extends infinitely in both directions without repeating. - **Chain with an Origin**: The sequence cannot be extended further in one direction. 3. **Classify Chains**: - A chain is **infinite** if it can be extended indefinitely in both negative and positive directions. - A chain **loops** if there exists some n such that x_n = x. - A chain **has an origin** if the sequence cannot be extended further at one end. 4. **Define Bijection varphi on Chains**: - If the chain of x in E is infinite or a loop, set: [ varphi(x) = f(x) ] - If the chain of x in E has an origin: - If the origin is in E, set: [ varphi(x) = f(x) ] - If the origin is in F, set: [ varphi(g(y)) = y quad text{for } g(y) = x ] 5. **Check varphi is Well-Defined and Bijective**: - Since f and g are injections, they do not map distinct elements to the same point.

On Tuesday, Kendra saw an average of 5 birds at each site, so the total number of birds seen on Tuesday is ( 5x ). On Wednesday, Kendra visited 10 sites and saw an average of 8 birds at each site, so the total number of birds seen on Wednesday is ( 10 times 8 = 80 ). The total number of birds seen over the three days is ( 7x + 5x + 80 ). The average number of birds seen per site over the three days is 7, and the total number of sites visited over the three days is ( x + x + 10 = 2x + 10 ). The total number of birds seen divided by the total number of sites visited gives us the average number of birds per site, which is 7. So we can set up the following equation: [ frac{7x + 5x + 80}{2x + 10} = 7 ] Solving for ( x ): [ 12x + 80 = 7(2x + 10) ] [ 12x + 80 = 14x + 70 ] Subtract ( 12x ) from both sides: [ 80 = 2x + 70 ] Subtract 70 from both sides: [ 10 = 2x ] Divide both sides by 2: [ x = 5 ] Kendra visited 5 sites on Monday and 5 sites on Tuesday, so the total number of sites visited on Monday and Tuesday is ( 5 + 5 = boxed{10} ) sites."},{"prompt":"What is the arithmetic mean of the integers from 3 through 6, inclusive?

If ( K ) and ( L ) intersect with ( M ), then ( K ) and ( L ) must intersect with each other because their intersections with ( M ) must share a common element. This means that clubs form groups of intersecting clubs where each pair within a group of clubs intersects with exactly two students. 3. **Defining Groups of Clubs**: Each group of intersecting clubs can be associated with a group of students combining the sets of their members. 4. **Key Observation**: Since the number of clubs ( n ) is greater than or equal to the number of students ( k ), in at least one group, the number of clubs exceeds the number of students in that group. Let's analyze such a group of clubs and students. 5. **Analyzing Pairs**: Assign each pair of clubs in the group a pair of students, where each student attends exactly one of these two clubs. - There are more pairs of clubs than pairs of students. - Therefore, there exists at least one pair of students which corresponds to at least two pairs of clubs.

Given that dividing this number by ( B ) yields a quotient of 121, we can write: [ frac{100A + B}{B} = 121 ] This simplifies to: [ 100A + B = 121B implies 100A = 120B implies A = frac{120B}{100} = 1.2B ] 2. The four-digit number formed by writing ( B ) in front of ( A ) is ( 100B + A ). Given that dividing this number by ( A ) yields a quotient of 84 and a remainder of 14, we can write: [ 100B + A = 84A + 14 ] Rearranging the above equation, we get: [ 100B = 84A + 14 - A = 83A + 14 implies 100B = 83A + 14 ] Thus, we can now represent our problem as a system of linear equations: [ begin{cases} A = 1.2B 100B = 83A + 14 end{cases} ] # Solving the System of Equations Substitute ( A = 1.2B ) into the second equation: [ 100B = 83(1.2B) + 14 implies 100B = 99.6B + 14 ] Subtract ( 99.6B ) from both sides: [ 100B - 99.6B = 14 implies 0.4B = 14 implies B = frac{14}{0.4} = 35 ] Now substitute ( B = 35 ) back into ( A = 1.2B ) to find ( A ): [ A = 1.2 times 35 = 42 ] Thus, the two numbers are: [ A = 42, quad B = 35 ] # Verification Lastly, we verify the solutions to ensure they satisfy the original conditions: 1. Calculate ( frac{100A + B}{B} ): [ frac{100 cdot 42 + 35}{35} = frac{4200 + 35}{35} = frac{4235}{35} = 121 ] This confirms the first condition. 2. Calculate ( frac{100B + A}{A} ): [ frac{100 cdot 35 + 42}{42} = frac{3500 + 42}{42} = frac{3542}{42} = 84 text{ remainder } 14 ] This confirms the second condition.

A number ( x ) is ( n )-good if it can be expressed as the sum of the reciprocals of ( n ) positive integers. 2. **Properties of ( n )-good Numbers:** - Any ( n )-good number is also an ((n+1))-good number. This is because if ( x = frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{a_2} + cdots + frac{1}{a_n} ), then ( x ) can also be written as ( x = frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{a_2} + cdots + frac{1}{a_n} + frac{1}{infty} ). - The maximum value of an ( n )-good number is ( n ), which occurs when all ( a_i = 1 ). 3. **Analyzing the Interval ([a, b]):** - If ([a, b]) contains infinitely many 2020-good numbers, then there must be a sequence of 2020-good numbers within this interval. - Consider the sequence ( x_n = 2019 + frac{1}{n} ). Each ( x_n ) is a 2020-good number because ( x_n = 1 + 1 + cdots + 1 + frac{1}{n} ) (with 2019 ones and one (frac{1}{n})). 4. **Bounding ( k ):** - For ( k leq 2018 ), the maximum ( k )-good number is ( k ), which is less than 2019. Therefore, it is impossible for the interval ([a, b]) to contain a ( k )-good number if ( a geq 2019 ). - For ( k = 2019 ), consider the sequence ( x_n = 2018 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{n} ). Each ( x_n ) is a 2020-good number because ( x_n = 1 + 1 + cdots + 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{n} ) (with 2018 ones, one (frac{1}{2}), and one (frac{1}{n})). This sequence converges to 2019 as ( n to infty ), so the interval ([a, b]) must contain 2019. 5. **Conclusion:** - If ( k geq 2019 ), then the interval ([a, b]) containing infinitely many 2020-good numbers must also contain at least one ( k )-good number.

This is because angle bisectors within similar triangles are also linear measurements that scale proportionally with the triangles. - **Option C:** The ratio of the perimeters of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of similarity.

We need to show that ( AB ) is perpendicular to ( CD ). 3. **Intersection Assumption:** - Suppose ( AA' ) and ( BB' ) intersect at some point ( P ). 4. **Considering Projections:** - Let ( L ) be the line through ( A' ) which is parallel to ( CD ). - Since ( A' ) is the foot of the perpendicular from ( A ) to ( BCD ), ( L ) is perpendicular to ( AA' ). 5. **Perpendicularity of Projections:** - Thus, ( CD perp AA' ). - Similarly, let ( L' ) be the line through ( B' ) which is parallel to ( CD ). - Since ( B' ) is the foot of the perpendicular from ( B ) to ( ACD ), ( L' ) is also perpendicular to ( BB' ). - Therefore, ( CD perp BB' ). 6. **Result from Perpendicularity:** - Since ( CD ) is perpendicular to both ( AA' ) and ( BB' ), and these lines are not parallel (they intersect by assumption), ( CD ) must be perpendicular to the plane defined by ( AA' ) and ( BB' ). - Since ( AA' ) and ( BB' ) are projections of non-parallel lines ( A ) and ( B ), it implies ( CD ) is perpendicular to ( AB ) because it is perpendicular to the whole plane containing ( AA' ) and ( BB' ). 7. **Converse:** - Conversely, assume ( AB perp CD ). - Consider the two planes ( alpha ) and ( beta ) defined by the sets ({ A, B, P }) and ({ A', B', P }), respectively. - If ( CD ) is perpendicular to ( AB ), it must be perpendicular to both ( AA' ) and ( BB' ) when extended, showing that ( P ) lies on both lines, meaning ( X = Y = P ), ensuring that ( AA' ) and ( BB' ) indeed intersect in a common plane. 8. **Conclusion for Other Values:** - For the case where ( AC = AD = BC = BD ): - Note that symmetry in this configuration implies that ( A ) and ( B ) are positioned such that perpendicularly dropped distances from them to opposite faces maintain the respective heights, consistent with the criteria proven above. - Hence, ( AA' ) and ( BB' ) do intersect because the geometric conditions ensure perpendicularity from the equality of sides causing symmetric properties. # Conclusion: [ boxed{ text{Yes, they intersect if } AC = AD = BC = BD. } ]"},{"prompt":"Write 0.overline{56} as a simplified fraction.","completion":"Let b = 0.overline{56}.

If public holidays and sick leave days do not count toward working days for calculating vacation days, and Andrew has to take any remaining vacation days before the end of the year or they will be lost. Also, halfway through the year, the company changed its policy: for every 20 days worked, an employee gets 1 vacation day. How many more vacation days can Andrew still take under these new parameters?","completion":"First, let's calculate how many vacation days Andrew earned before the policy change. Since public holidays and sick leave days do not count toward working days, we need to subtract those from the total days worked to find the number of days that count toward vacation days. Total days worked: 290 days Public holidays: -10 days Sick leave: -5 days Days that count toward vacation: 290 - 10 - 5 = 275 days Before the policy change, Andrew earned 1 vacation day for every 10 days worked. Let's assume the policy change happened exactly halfway through the year, so for the first half of the year, he worked half of the 275 days. Days worked in the first half of the year: 275 / 2 = 137.5 days Since we can't have half days, we'll round down to 137 days. Vacation days earned in the first half of the year: 137 / 10 = 13.7 days We'll round down to 13 days because typically vacation days are not awarded in fractions. Now, let's calculate the vacation days earned after the policy change. For the second half of the year, Andrew worked the other half of the 275 days. Days worked in the second half of the year: 275 / 2 = 137.5 days Again, we'll round down to 137 days. Under the new policy, Andrew earns 1 vacation day for every 20 days worked. Vacation days earned in the second half of the year: 137 / 20 = 6.85 days We'll round down to 6 days. Total vacation days earned: 13 (first half) + 6 (second half) = 19 days Now let's calculate how many vacation days Andrew has already taken. In March, he took 5 days off, and in September, he took twice as many, which is 10 days. Total vacation days taken: 5 (March) + 10 (September) = 15 days Finally, let's calculate how many vacation days Andrew can still take.

Expanding the products, we get: [ = frac{x^n y^n (x^2 y + xy^2 - x^3 - y^3)}{(x - y)^2} ] Simplifying, we find: [ = frac{x^n y^n (x + y)(2xy - x^2 - y^2)}{(x - y)^2} = - x^n y^n (x + y) ] 8. Since (x^n y^n (x + y)) is an integer, and similarly: [ a_{n+2}a_n - a_{n+1}^2 = frac{(x^{n+2} - y^{n+2})(x^n - y^n) - (x^{n+1} - y^{n+1})^2}{(x - y)^2} = - x^n y^n ] Hence, (x^n y^n) is an integer. 9. Using induction again, suppose (a_m) is an integer for some (m): [ x^n y^n text{ is also an integer, } ] indicating (xy) is rational. If (xy) is rational and (x + y) is rational, consider it as (frac{p}{q}): [ a_k = (x + y)a_{k-1} - xya_{k-2} = frac{p p_{k-1} - xyq^2 p_{k-2}}{q^k} ] 10. Given (p) and (q) are co-prime, (a_k = frac{p_k}{q^k}) reflects a contradiction as (a_k) is supposed to be an integer. Thus, (x + y) must be an integer. # Conclusion: Given the properties and the contradiction derived: [ boxed{x + y text{ and } xy text{ must both be integers}} ] So, the expression (frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}) is an integer for all positive integers (n)."},{"prompt":"Find the value of t for which the vector [bold{v} = begin{pmatrix} 3 1 5 end{pmatrix} + t begin{pmatrix} 4 3 2 end{pmatrix}] is closest to [bold{a} = begin{pmatrix} 1 6 2 end{pmatrix}.]","completion":"To find the value of t for which bold{v} is closest to bold{a}, we need the vector from bold{v} to bold{a} to be orthogonal to the direction vector begin{pmatrix} 4 3 2 end{pmatrix}.

Now, to find the distance from M to V, we use the distance formula for two points in space: begin{align*} MV &= sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + (z-0)^2} &= sqrt{6^2 + 3^2 + 2^2} &= sqrt{36 + 9 + 4} &= sqrt{49} &= 7 text{ cm} end{align*} Hence, the distance from point M to the apex V of the tetrahedron is boxed{7text{ cm}}."},{"prompt":"There are 81,650 students arranged in 22 rows and 75 columns.

For a line not to pass through this quadrant, it must either lie entirely in the first, second, and fourth quadrants or just in the second and fourth quadrants. 2. **Condition for the Second and Fourth Quadrants:** If the line only passes through the second and fourth quadrants, one possible condition is k=0. However, this is a specific case and not a general condition for k. 3. **Analyzing k-2 lt 0:** For the line to avoid the third quadrant, the slope (k-2) must be negative, which implies k-2 lt 0 Rightarrow k lt 2.

Since the sides and altitude are rational, the area will be rational. By scaling, we can ensure the area is a positive integer. 6. **Conclusion:** By constructing such a sequence of triangles, we can ensure that for each integer ( n ge 3 ), there exist positive integers ( a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_n ) such that for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n-2 ), the sides ( a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2} ) form a triangle with a positive integer area.

The number of geese that survived the first month is: (4/5)(1/4)E = (4/5)(1/4)(2400) = (4/5)(600) = 480 Now, we subtract the number that survived the first year (120) from the number that survived the first month (480): 480 - 120 = 360 So, 360 geese that survived the first month did not survive the first year. The fraction of the geese that survived the first month but did not survive the first year is: 360 (geese that did not survive the first year) / 480 (geese that survived the first month) = 3/4 Therefore, boxed{3/4} of the geese that survived the first month did not survive the first year."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x) = x + a(e^(2x) 3e^x + 2), where a ∈ R: 1.

The total number of eggs in the pile they were collecting with 6 other people was 400 eggs, and Emma gathered 60 eggs in the second egg hunt round.

Then, Emma gathered T - 10 eggs in the first round. In the second round, Tank gathered 20 less than in the first round, so Tank gathered T - 20 eggs in the second round. Emma gathered 60 eggs in the second round. Therefore, the ratio of the number of eggs Emma gathered to the number of eggs Tank gathered in the second round is 60:(T - 20). Now, let's find the total number of eggs they both gathered in both rounds. Since there were 8 people gathering from a pile of 400 eggs, we can assume that all the eggs were gathered. The total number of eggs Tank gathered in both rounds is T + (T - 20) = 2T - 20. The total number of eggs Emma gathered in both rounds is (T - 10) + 60 = T + 50. The sum of the eggs gathered by both Tank and Emma is (2T - 20) + (T + 50) = 3T + 30. Since the total number of eggs is 400, we can write the equation: 3T + 30 = 400 Now, let's solve for T: 3T = 400 - 30 3T = 370 T = 370 / 3 T = 123.33 Since the number of eggs must be a whole number, we can round T to the nearest whole number, which is 123 eggs (Tank's first round). Now, let's find the number of eggs Tank gathered in the second round: T - 20 = 123 - 20 = 103 eggs (Tank's second round).

Due to the commutativity ( (b * c) * a = a * (b * c) ): [ (a * b) * c = a * (b * c). ] Since we have shown both commutativity and associativity, the required properties of ( * ) have been established.

The midpoint of MN is P(x_{0}, y_{0}). We set t=-3a-1, so the equation of line l becomes l: y=4x+t, where t<0. - Given the eccentricity frac{c}{a}=sqrt{5}, we find frac{b}{a}=sqrt{left(frac{c}{a}right)^2-1}=sqrt{5-1}=2. The asymptotes of the hyperbola are thus y=pm 2x. - Solving the system left{begin{array}{l}y=4x+ty=2xend{array}right. gives us M(-frac{t}{2}, -t).

Since y_{1}+y_{2}=-frac{2}{3}t=y_{3}+y_{4}, it implies P is the midpoint of both MN and AB. - Given |MA|=frac{1}{2}|AB|, we deduce that A and B trisect segment MN.

Therefore, it implies: [ angle BNC = 90^circ ] 3. **Using Sum of Angles in a Triangle:** The sum of angles within any triangle is 180^circ. Applying this to triangle NBC: [ angle BNC + angle NBC + angle BCN = 180^circ ] We already know angle BNC = 90^circ and angle BCN = 45^circ: [ 90^circ + 45^circ + angle BCN = 180^circ ] Thus, angle BCN = 45^circ. 4. **Computation of Angle Conditions:** According to the conditions of the problem: [ angle NCA + angle NBC = angle NCA + theta = angle NBC ] 5. **Geometric Interpretation:** The point N lies on the circle with diameter AB (therefore angle ANB = 90^circ) and also lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC.

Given that f(x) + g(2+x) = 4, substituting x with -x, we get f(-x) + g(2-x) = 4. Using the even property, we can rewrite this as f(-x) + g(2+x) = 4. Therefore, we have: [f(x) + g(2+x) = f(-x) + g(2+x) = 4] This implies f(x) = f(-x), indicating that f(x) is an even function. 2. **Analysis of Option A:** Given f(x+1) + f(x-1) = 2, substituting x with 1-x, we get f(2-x) + f(-x) = 2. Since f(x) is even, f(-x) = f(x), so we have f(2-x) + f(x) = 2. This does not necessarily imply symmetry with respect to the line x=1, so option A is incorrect. 3. **Analysis of Option B:** Since f(x+1) + f(1-x) = 2 and we know f(x) is even, this condition alone does not guarantee central symmetry specifically with respect to the point (1,0). The correct point of symmetry, considering the even nature of f(x), would be along the y-axis, not (1,0). Therefore, option B is incorrect. 4. **Analysis of Option C:** Given f(x+1) + f(x-1) = 2, we can deduce a periodic behavior. For instance, f(x+3) + f(x+1) = 2 implies f(x+3) = f(x-1). This suggests a period of 4 for f(x). Therefore, f(2023) = f(2023 mod 4) = f(-1). Also, from f(1) + f(-1) = 2 and knowing f(-1) = f(1), we find 2f(1) = 2, which leads to f(1) = 1.

Since we have only 7 students, and 64 > 7, it is possible to find a set of 6 subjects such that no two students have the same combination of marks in these 6 subjects. 4. **Constructing the proof:** We will use a combinatorial argument to show that we can always find such a set of 6 subjects. - Consider the set of all possible pairs of students. There are binom{7}{2} = 21 pairs of students. - We need to show that we can find 6 subjects such that for each of these 21 pairs, there is at least one subject in which the two students have different marks. 5. **Counting unique pairs:** - For each subject X_i, there are binom{7}{2} = 21 possible pairs of students. - Since no two students have identical marks in all 12 subjects, each subject X_i must differentiate between at least some pairs of students. 6. **Choosing subjects:** - Start by picking a subject X_1 that contains a pair (a, b). This subject will differentiate between a and b. - Next, pick another subject X_2 that contains a pair (c, d) not already differentiated by X_1. This subject will differentiate between c and d. - Continue this process, ensuring that each new subject chosen differentiates at least one new pair of students not already differentiated by the previous subjects. 7. **Ensuring coverage:** - By the time we have chosen 6 subjects, we will have differentiated at least 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21 unique pairs of students. - This guarantees that any two students will have different marks in at least one of these 6 subjects. 8. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, we can always choose 6 subjects such that any two of the students have different marks in at least one of these subjects.

A quadratic equation in one variable should only contain one variable, typically x, and its highest power should be 2. Therefore, option A is not a quadratic equation in one variable because it includes an additional variable y. - **Option B: x^2-frac{5}{x}=5** This equation involves a term with x in the denominator, which after manipulation could lead to a higher degree polynomial or maintain a fractional form. Specifically, to clear the fraction, one might multiply each term by x to get x^3 - 5 = 5x, which is not in the standard form of a quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0). Therefore, option B is not a standard quadratic equation in one variable due to its fractional component. - **Option C: x(x-3)=0** Expanding this equation gives x^2 - 3x = 0, which is in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a=1, b=-3, and c=0. This is a quadratic equation in one variable since it involves only x, and the highest power of x is 2. Therefore, option C is a quadratic equation in one variable. - **Option D: ax^2 + bx + c = 0 (where a, b, and c are constants)** This is the general form of a quadratic equation. However, the condition that a=0 makes it a linear equation, not a quadratic one, because the x^2 term disappears, leaving bx + c = 0. For an equation to be considered quadratic, the coefficient of x^2 (i.e., a) must be non-zero. Therefore, with the condition that a=0, option D does not always represent a quadratic equation in one variable.

Now suppose that for some ( n < 2021 cdot 1011 ), there exists such a subset ( T ), but there doesn't exist a subset ( T' ) for ( n + 1 ). If ( 1 notin T ), then we can just let ( T' = T cup {1} ).

To find the range of p(x), determine all possible values of y such that p(x) = y for some x geq 0. This gives us: (x^2 - 3)^2 = y. To solve for x, consider: x^2 - 3 = sqrt{y} text{ or } x^2 - 3 = -sqrt{y} implies x^2 = sqrt{y} + 3. Because x^2 must be nonnegative, and x^2 = sqrt{y} + 3 geq 0, it follows that: sqrt{y} + 3 geq 0 implies sqrt{y} geq -3. Since the square root is never negative, we must have: sqrt{y} geq 0 implies y geq 0. However, we need to check if smaller values of y (less than 0) can actually make the equation x^2 = sqrt{y} + 3 invalid. Because sqrt{y} is undefined for y < 0 in the real numbers, we check: sqrt{y} - 3 = 0 implies sqrt{y} = 3 implies y = 9. Thus, y must be at least 0, and from the minimum value, we have: x^2 - 3 = 0 implies x^2 = 3 implies x = sqrt{3}. p(sqrt{3}) = (sqrt{3}^2 - 3)^2 = 0^2 = 0. So the minimum possible value of y is 0.

Here's the step-by-step solution: 1. **Identifying Center Square**: - Notice that there are 3 distinct configurations of the grid based on the color of the center square. This is because the grid's overall structure remains the same regardless of which color is in the center. - Let's fix the center square to be one of the colors, say red. We will later multiply by 3 to account for the other color choices (white and blue) that the center square can be. 2. **Arranging First Row and First Column**: - After fixing the center square, let's focus on filling the remaining squares. - We can place a square in the top-left corner of the grid. - There are 3 choices for this (a red, a white, or a blue square). 3. **Choosing Remaining Positions in First Row and First Column**: - After placing the top-left square, the first row and first column have limited choices. - The choice for the second square in the first row is affected by the top-left choice. However, it can be any of the remaining two colors, leading to 2 choices. - Similarly, for the second square in the first column, after considering the top-left choice, there are 2 choices. 4. **Filling the Grid**: - Once three positions (center, top-left, and first row second element) are determined, the rest of the grid fills itself automatically with only one valid configuration to meet the requirements of 1 of each color per row and column. - Thus, for one fixed center color, the number of valid configurations = 3 cdot 2 cdot 2 = 12. 5. **Accounting for Rotations and Reflections**: - Amongst the 12 configurations found above, we need to consider that each arrangement can be rotated by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, or 270 degrees, essentially giving the same fundamental arrangement. - This means that each distinct configuration actually represents 3 other configurations due to rotational symmetry. 6. **Calculating Unique Configurations**: - Therefore, the number of fundamentally unique configurations considering rotations = frac{12}{4} = 3 configurations for any fixed center color. 7. **Accounting for Different Center Colors**: - Since any of the colors (red, white, blue) can be the center, we need to account for all 3 possible center color configurations. - This results in 3 cdot 3 = 9 fundamentally unique configurations. **Conclusion:** There are exactly ( 9 ) distinct ways to arrange the 3 times 3 grid such that each row and each column contains one red, one white, and one blue square.

Medicines and weight-loss surgery also are options for some people if lifestyle changes aren't enough. Set Realistic Goals Setting realistic weight-loss goals is an important first step to losing weight. For Adults Try to lose 5 to 10 percent of your current weight over 6 months. This will lower your risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and other conditions. The best way to lose weight is slowly. A weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds a week is do-able, safe, and will help you keep off the weight. It also will give you the time to make new, healthy lifestyle changes. If you've lost 10 percent of your body weight, have kept it off for 6 months, and are still overweight or obese, you may want to consider further weight loss. For Children and Teens If your child is overweight or at risk for overweight or obesity, the goal is to maintain his or her current weight and to focus on eating healthy and being physically active. This should be part of a family effort to make lifestyle changes. If your child is overweight or obese and has a health condition related to overweight or obesity, your doctor may refer you to a pediatric obesity treatment center. Lifestyle Changes Lifestyle changes can help you and your family achieve long-term weight-loss success. Example of lifestyle changes include: Focusing on balancing energy IN (calories from food and drinks) with energy OUT (physical activity) Following a healthy eating plan Learning how to adopt healthy lifestyle habits Over time, these changes will become part of your everyday life. Calories Cutting back on calories (energy IN) will help you lose weight. To lose 1 to 2pounds a week, adults should cut back their calorie intake by 500 to 1,000calories a day. In general, having 1,000 to 1,200 calories a day will help most women lose weight safely. In general, having 1,200 to 1,600 calories a day will help most men lose weight safely. This calorie range also is suitable for women who weigh 165pounds or more or who exercise routinely. These calorie levels are a guide and may need to be adjusted. If you eat 1,600calories a day but don't lose weight, then you may want to cut back to 1,200calories. If you're hungry on either diet, then you may want to add 100 to 200calories a day. Very low-calorie diets with fewer than 800 calories a day shouldn't be used unless your doctor is monitoring you. For overweight children and teens, it's important to slow the rate of weight gain. However, reduced-calorie diets aren't advised unless you talk with a health care provider. Healthy Eating Plan A healthy eating plan gives your body the nutrients it needs every day. It has enough calories for good health, but not so many that you gain weight. A healthy eating plan is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. Following a healthy eating plan will lower your risk for heart disease and other conditions. Healthy foods include: Fat-free and low-fat dairy products, such as low-fat yogurt, cheese, and milk. Protein foods, such as lean meat, fish, poultry without skin, beans, and peas. Whole-grain foods, such as whole-wheat bread, oatmeal, and brown rice. Other grain foods include pasta, cereal, bagels, bread, tortillas, couscous, and crackers. Fruits, which can be fresh, canned, frozen, or dried. Vegetables, which can be fresh, canned (without salt), frozen, or dried. Canola and olive oils, and soft margarines made from these oils, are heart healthy. However, you should use them in small amounts because they're high in calories. You also can include unsalted nuts, like walnuts and almonds, in your diet as long as you limit the amount you eat (nuts also are high in calories). The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \\"Aim for a Healthy Weight\\" patient booklet provides more information about following a healthy eating plan. Foods to limit. Foods that are high in saturated and trans fats and cholesterol raise blood cholesterol levels and also might be high in calories. Fats and cholesterol raise your risk for heart disease, so they should be limited. Saturated fat is found mainly in: Fatty cuts of meat, such as ground beef, sausage, and processed meats (for example, bologna, hot dogs, and deli meats) Poultry with the skin High-fat dairy products like whole-milk cheeses, whole milk, cream, butter, and ice cream Lard, coconut, and palm oils, which are found in many processed foods Trans fat is found mainly in: Foods with partially hydrogenated oils, such as many hard margarines and shortening Baked products and snack foods, such as crackers, cookies, doughnuts, and breads Foods fried in hydrogenated shortening, such as french fries and chicken Cholesterol mainly is found in: Egg yolks Organ meats, such as liver Shrimp Whole milk or whole-milk products, such as butter, cream, and cheese Limiting foods and drinks with added sugars, like high-fructose corn syrup, is important. Added sugars will give you extra calories without nutrients like vitamins and minerals. Added sugars are found in many desserts, canned fruit packed in syrup, fruit drinks, and nondiet drinks. Check the list of ingredients on food packages for added sugars like high-fructose corn syrup. Drinks that contain alcohol also will add calories, so it's a good idea to limit your alcohol intake. Portion size. A portion is the amount of food that you choose to eat for a meal or snack. It's different from a serving, which is a measured amount of food and is noted on the Nutrition Facts label on food packages. Anyone who has eaten out lately is likely to notice how big the portions are. In fact, over the past 40 years, portion sizes have grown significantly. These growing portion sizes have changed what we think of as a normal portion. Cutting back on portion size is a good way to eat fewer calories and balance your energy IN. Food weight. Studies have shown that we all tend to eat a constant \\"weight\\" of food. Ounce for ounce, our food intake is fairly consistent. Knowing this, you can lose weight if you eat foods that are lower in calories and fat for a given amount of food. For example, replacing a full-fat food product that weighs 2 ounces with a low-fat product that weighs the same helps you cut back on calories. Another helpful practice is to eat foods that contain a lot of water, such as vegetables, fruits, and soups. Physical Activity Being physically active and eating fewer calories will help you lose weight and keep weight off over time. Physical activity also will benefit you in other ways. It will: Lower your risk for heart disease, heart attack, diabetes, and cancers (such as breast, uterine, and colon cancers) Strengthen your heart and help your lungs work better Strengthen your muscles and keep your joints in good condition Slow bone loss Give you more energy Help you relax and better cope with stress Allow you to fall asleep more quickly and sleep more soundly Give you an enjoyable way to share time with friends and family The four main types of physical activity are aerobic, muscle-strengthening, bone strengthening, and stretching. You can do physical activity with light, moderate, or vigorous intensity. The level of intensity depends on how hard you have to work to do the activity. People vary in the amount of physical activity they need to control their weight. Many people can maintain their weight by doing 150 to 300 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes to 5 hours) of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking. People who want to lose a large amount of weight (more than 5 percent of their body weight) may need to do more than 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week. This also may be true for people who want to keep off weight that they've lost. You don't have to do the activity all at once. You can break it up into short periods of at least 10 minutes each. If you have a heart problem or chronic disease, such as heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure, talk with your doctor about what types of physical activity are safe for you. You also should talk with your doctor about safe physical activities if you have symptoms such as chest pain or dizziness. Children should get at least 60 minutes or more of physical activity every day. Most physical activity should be moderate-intensity aerobic activity. Activity should vary and be a good fit for the child's age and physical development. Many people lead inactive lives and might not be motivated to do more physical activity. When starting a physical activity program, some people may need help and supervision to avoid injury. If you're obese, or if you haven't been active in the past, start physical activity slowly and build up the intensity a little at a time. When starting out, one way to be active is to do more everyday activities, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator and doing household chores and yard work. The next step is to start walking, biking, or swimming at a slow pace, and then build up the amount of time you exercise or the intensity level of the activity. To lose weight and gain better health, it's important to get moderate-intensity physical activity. Choose activities that you enjoy and that fit into your daily life. A daily, brisk walk is an easy way to be more active and improve your health. Use a pedometer to count your daily steps and keep track of how much you're walking. Try to increase the number of steps you take each day. Other examples of moderate-intensity physical activity include dancing, gardening, and water aerobics. For greater health benefits, try to step up your level of activity or the length of time you're active. For example, start walking for 10 to 15 minutes three times a week, and then build up to brisk walking for 60 minutes, 5 days a week. For more information about physical activity, go to the Department of Health and Human Services \\"2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\\" and the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article. Behavioral Changes Changing your behaviors or habits related to food and physical activity is important for losing weight. The first step is to understand which habits lead you to overeat or have an inactive lifestyle. The next step is to change these habits. Below are some simple tips to help you adopt healthier habits. Change your surroundings. You might be more likely to overeat when watching TV, when treats are available at work, or when you're with a certain friend. You also might find it hard to motivate yourself to be physically active. However, you can change these habits. Instead of watching TV, dance to music in your living room or go for a walk. Leave the office break room right after you get a cup of coffee. Bring a change of clothes to work. Head straight to an exercise class on the way home from work. Put a note on your calendar to remind yourself to take a walk or go to your exercise class. Keep a record. A record of your food intake and the amount of physical activity that you do each day will help inspire you. You also can keep track of your weight. For example, when the record shows that you've been meeting your physical activity goals, you'll want to keep it up. A record also is an easy way to track how you're doing, especially if you're working with a registered dietitian or nutritionist. Seek support. Ask for help or encouragement from your friends, family, and health care provider. You can get support in person, through e-mail, or by talking on the phone. You also can join a support group. Reward success. Reward your success for meeting your weight-loss goals or other achievements with something you would like to do, not with food. Choose rewards that you'll enjoy, such as a movie, music CD, an afternoon off from work, a massage, or personal time. Weight-Loss Medicines Weight-loss medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) might be an option for some people. If you're not successful at losing 1 pound a week after 6months of using lifestyle changes, medicines may help. You should only use medicines as part of a program that includes diet, physical activity, and behavioral changes. Weight-loss medicines might be suitable for adults who are obese (a BMI of 30 or greater). People who have BMIs of 27 or greater, and who are at risk for heart disease and other health conditions, also may benefit from weight-loss medicines. Sibutramine (Meridia) As of October 2010, the weight-loss medicine sibutramine (Meridia) was taken off the market in the United States. Research showed that the medicine may raise the risk of heart attack and stroke. Orlistat (Xenical and Alli) Orlistat (Xenical) causes a weight loss between 5 and 10 pounds, although some people lose more weight. Most of the weight loss occurs within the first 6 months of taking the medicine. People taking Xenical need regular checkups with their doctors, especially during the first year of taking the medicine. During checkups, your doctor will check your weight, blood pressure, and pulse and may recommend other tests. He or she also will talk with you about any medicine side effects and answer your questions. The FDA also has approved Alli, an over-the-counter (OTC) weight-loss aid for adults. Alli is the lower dose form of orlistat. Alli is meant to be used along with a reduced-calorie, low-fat diet and physical activity. In studies, most people taking Alli lost 5 to 10pounds over 6 months. Both Xenical and Alli reduce the absorption of fats, fat calories, and vitamins A, D, E, and K to promote weight loss. Both medicines also can cause mild side effects, such as oily and loose stools. Although rare, some reports of liver disease have occurred with the use of orlistat. More research is needed to find out whether the medicine plays a role in causing liver disease. Talk with your doctor if youre considering using Xenical or Alli to lose weight. He or she can discuss the risks and benefits with you. You also should talk with your doctor before starting orlistat if youre taking blood-thinning medicines or being treated for diabetes or thyroid disease. Also, ask your doctor whether you should take a multivitamin due to the possible loss of some vitamins. Lorcaserin Hydrochloride (Belviq) and Qsymia In July 2012, the FDA approved two new medicines for chronic (ongoing) weight management. Lorcaserin hydrochloride (Belviq) and Qsymia are approved for adults who have a BMI of 30 or greater. (Qsymia is a combination of two FDA-approved medicines: phentermine and topiramate.) These medicines also are approved for adults with a BMI of 27 or greater who have at least one weight-related condition, such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high blood cholesterol. Both medicines are meant to be used along with a reduced-calorie diet and physical activity. Other Medicines Some prescription medicines are used for weight loss, but aren't FDA-approved for treating obesity. They include: Medicines to treat depression. Some medicines for depression cause an initial weight loss and then a regain of weight while taking the medicine. Medicines to treat seizures. Two medicines used for seizures, topiramate and zonisamide, have been shown to cause weight loss. These medicines are being studied to see whether they will be useful in treating obesity. Medicines to treat diabetes. Metformin may cause small amounts of weight loss in people who have obesity and diabetes. It's not known how this medicine causes weight loss, but it has been shown to reduce hunger and food intake. Over-the-Counter Products Some OTC products claim to promote weight loss. The FDA doesn't regulate these products because they're considered dietary supplements, not medicines. However, many of these products have serious side effects and generally aren't recommended. Some of these OTC products include: Ephedra (also called ma huang). Ephedra comes from plants and has been sold as a dietary supplement. The active ingredient in the plant is called ephedrine. Ephedra can cause short-term weight loss, but it also has serious side effects. It causes high blood pressure and stresses the heart. In 2004, the FDA banned the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedra in the United States. Chromium. This is a mineral that's sold as a dietary supplement to reduce body fat. While studies haven't found any weight-loss benefit from chromium, there are few serious side effects from taking it. Diuretics and herbal laxatives. These products cause you to lose water weight, not fat. They also can lower your body's potassium levels, which may cause heart and muscle problems. Hoodia. Hoodia is a cactus that's native to Africa. It's sold in pill form as an appetite suppressant. However, no firm evidence shows that hoodia works. No large-scale research has been done on humans to show whether hoodia is effective or safe. Weight-Loss Surgery Weight-loss surgery might be an option for people who have extreme obesity (BMI of 40 or more) when other treatments have failed. Weight-loss surgery also is an option for people who have a BMI of 35 or more and life-threatening conditions, such as: Severe sleep apnea (a condition in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep) Obesity-related cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee; diseases of the heart muscle) Severe type 2 diabetes Types of Weight-Loss Surgery Two common weight-loss surgeries include banded gastroplasty and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. For gastroplasty, a band or staples are used to create a small pouch at the top of your stomach. This surgery limits the amount of food and liquids the stomach can hold. For gastric bypass, a small stomach pouch is created with a bypass around part of the small intestine where most of the calories you eat are absorbed. This surgery limits food intake and reduces the calories your body absorbs. Weight-loss surgery can improve your health and weight. However, the surgery can be risky, depending on your overall health. Gastroplasty has few long-term side effects, but you must limit your food intake dramatically. Gastric bypass has more side effects. They include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), bloating, diarrhea, and faintness. These side effects are all part of a condition called dumping syndrome. After gastric bypass, you may need multivitamins and minerals to prevent nutrient deficiencies. Lifelong medical followup is needed after both surgeries. Your doctor also may recommend a program both before and after surgery to help you with diet, physical activity, and coping skills. If you think you would benefit from weight-loss surgery, talk with your doctor. Ask whether you're a candidate for the surgery and discuss the risks, benefits, and what to expect. Weight-Loss Maintenance Maintaining your weight loss over time can be a challenge. For adults, weight loss is a success if you lose at least 10 percent of your initial weight and you don't regain more than 6 or 7 pounds in 2 years. You also must keep a lower waist circumference (at least 2 inches lower than your waist circumference before you lost weight). After 6 months of keeping off the weight, you can think about losing more if: You've already lost 5 to 10 percent of your body weight You're still overweight or obese The key to losing more weight or maintaining your weight loss is to continue with lifestyle changes. Adopt these changes as a new way of life. If you want to lose more weight, you may need to eat fewer calories and increase your activity level. For example, if you eat 1,600 calories a day but don't lose weight, you may want to cut back to 1,200 calories. It's also important to make physical activity part of your normal daily routine."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Overweight and Obesity ?","completion":"Following a healthy lifestyle can help you prevent overweight and obesity. Many lifestyle habits begin during childhood. Thus, parents and families should encourage their children to make healthy choices, such as following a healthy diet and being physically active. Make following a healthy lifestyle a family goal. For example: Follow a healthy eating plan. Make healthy food choices, keep your calorie needs and your family's calorie needs in mind, and focus on the balance of energy IN and energy OUT. Focus on portion size. Watch the portion sizes in fast food and other restaurants. The portions served often are enough for two or three people. Children's portion sizes should be smaller than those for adults. Cutting back on portion size will help you balance energy IN and energy OUT. Be active. Make personal and family time active. Find activities that everyone will enjoy. For example, go for a brisk walk, bike or rollerblade, or train together for a walk or run. Reduce screen time. Limit the use of TVs, computers, DVDs, and videogames because they limit time for physical activity. Health experts recommend 2hours or less a day of screen time that's not work- or homework-related. Keep track of your weight, body mass index, and waist circumference. Also, keep track of your children's growth. Led by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, four Institutes from the National Institutes of Health have come together to promote We Can!Ways to Enhance Children's Activity & Nutrition. We Can! is a national education program designed for parents and caregivers to help children 8 to 13 years old maintain a healthy weight. The evidence-based program offers parents and families tips and fun activities to encourage healthy eating, increase physical activity, and reduce time spent being inactive. Currently, more than 140 community groups around the country are participating in We Can! programs for parents and youth. These community groups include hospitals, health departments, clinics, faith-based organizations, YMCAs, schools, and more. ____________ We Can! is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Cardiogenic Shock ?","completion":"Cardiogenic (kar-dee-oh-JE-nik) shock is a condition in which a suddenly weakened heart isn't able to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. The condition is a medical emergency and is fatal if not treated right away. The most common cause of cardiogenic shock is damage to the heart muscle from a severe heart attack. However, not everyone who has a heart attack has cardiogenic shock. In fact, on average, only about 7 percent of people who have heart attacks develop the condition. If cardiogenic shock does occur, it's very dangerous. When people die from heart attacks in hospitals, cardiogenic shock is the most common cause of death. What Is Shock? The medical term \\"shock\\" refers to a state in which not enough blood and oxygen reach important organs in the body, such as the brain and kidneys. Shock causes very low blood pressure and may be life threatening. Shock can have many causes. Cardiogenic shock is only one type of shock. Other types of shock include hypovolemic (hy-po-vo-LEE-mik) shock and vasodilatory (VAZ-oh-DILE-ah-tor-e) shock. Hypovolemic shock is a condition in which the heart cant pump enough blood to the body because of severe blood loss. In vasodilatory shock, the blood vessels suddenly relax. When the blood vessels are too relaxed, blood pressure drops and blood flow becomes very low. Without enough blood pressure, blood and oxygen dont reach the bodys organs. A bacterial infection in the bloodstream, a severe allergic reaction, or damage to the nervous system (brain and nerves) may cause vasodilatory shock. When a person is in shock (from any cause), not enough blood and oxygen are reaching the body's organs. If shock lasts more than a few minutes, the lack of oxygen starts to damage the bodys organs. If shock isn't treated quickly, it can cause permanent organ damage or death. Some of the signs and symptoms of shock include: Confusion or lack of alertness Loss of consciousness A sudden and ongoing rapid heartbeat Sweating Pale skin A weak pulse Rapid breathing Decreased or no urine output Cool hands and feet If you think that you or someone else is in shock, call 911 right away for emergency treatment. Prompt medical care can save your life and prevent or limit damage to your bodys organs. Outlook In the past, almost no one survived cardiogenic shock. Now, about half of the people who go into cardiogenic shock survive. This is because of prompt recognition of symptoms and improved treatments, such as medicines and devices. These treatments can restore blood flow to the heart and help the heart pump better. In some cases, devices that take over the pumping function of the heart are used. Implanting these devices requires major surgery."},{"prompt":"What causes Cardiogenic Shock ?","completion":"Immediate Causes Cardiogenic shock occurs if the heart suddenly can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body. The most common cause of cardiogenic shock is damage to the heart muscle from a severe heart attack. This damage prevents the hearts main pumping chamber, the left ventricle (VEN-trih-kul), from working well. As a result, the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. In about 3 percent of cardiogenic shock cases, the hearts lower right chamber, the right ventricle, doesnt work well. This means the heart can't properly pump blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen to bring back to the heart and the rest of the body. Without enough oxygen-rich blood reaching the bodys major organs, many problems can occur. For example: Cardiogenic shock can cause death if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the organs isn't restored quickly. This is why emergency medical treatment is required. If organs don't get enough oxygen-rich blood, they won't work well. Cells in the organs die, and the organs may never work well again. As some organs stop working, they may cause problems with other bodily functions. This, in turn, can worsen shock. For example: - If the kidneys aren't working well, the levels of important chemicals in the body change. This may cause the heart and other muscles to become even weaker, limiting blood flow even more. - If the liver isn't working well, the body stops making proteins that help the blood clot. This can lead to more bleeding if the shock is due to blood loss. If the kidneys aren't working well, the levels of important chemicals in the body change. This may cause the heart and other muscles to become even weaker, limiting blood flow even more. If the liver isn't working well, the body stops making proteins that help the blood clot. This can lead to more bleeding if the shock is due to blood loss. How well the brain, kidneys, and other organs recover will depend on how long a person is in shock. The less time a person is in shock, the less damage will occur to the organs. This is another reason why emergency treatment is so important. Underlying Causes The underlying causes of cardiogenic shock are conditions that weaken the heart and prevent it from pumping enough oxygen-rich blood to the body. Heart Attack Most heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque (plak) narrows or blocks the coronary (heart) arteries. Plaque reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. It also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow. Conditions Caused by Heart Attack Heart attacks can cause some serious heart conditions that can lead to cardiogenic shock. One example is ventricular septal rupture. This condition occurs if the wall that separates the ventricles (the hearts two lower chambers) breaks down. The breakdown happens because cells in the wall have died due to a heart attack. Without the wall to separate them, the ventricles cant pump properly. Heart attacks also can cause papillary muscle infarction or rupture. This condition occurs if the muscles that help anchor the heart valves stop working or break because a heart attack cuts off their blood supply. If this happens, blood doesn't flow correctly between the hearts chambers. This prevents the heart from pumping properly. Other Heart Conditions Serious heart conditions that may occur with or without a heart attack can cause cardiogenic shock. Examples include: Myocarditis (MI-o-kar-DI-tis). This is inflammation of the heart muscle. Endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis). This is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. Life-threatening arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs). These are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. Pericardial tamponade (per-ih-KAR-de-al tam-po-NADE). This is too much fluid or blood around the heart. The fluid squeezes the heart muscle so it can't pump properly. Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a sudden blockage in a lung artery. This condition usually is caused by a blood clot that travels to the lung from a vein in the leg. PE can damage your heart and other organs in your body."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Cardiogenic Shock? ?","completion":"The most common risk factor for cardiogenic shock is having a heart attack. If you've had a heart attack, the following factors can further increase your risk for cardiogenic shock: Older age A history of heart attacks or heart failure Coronary heart disease that affects all of the hearts major blood vessels High blood pressure Diabetes Women who have heart attacks are at higher risk for cardiogenic shock than men who have heart attacks."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Cardiogenic Shock ?","completion":"A lack of oxygen-rich blood reaching the brain, kidneys, skin, and other parts of the body causes the signs and symptoms of cardiogenic shock.

If you or someone else is having these signs and symptoms, call 911 right away for emergency treatment. Prompt medical care can save your life and prevent or limit organ damage."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Cardiogenic Shock ?","completion":"The first step in diagnosing cardiogenic shock is to identify that a person is in shock. At that point, emergency treatment should begin. Once emergency treatment starts, doctors can look for the specific cause of the shock. If the reason for the shock is that the heart isn't pumping strongly enough, then the diagnosis is cardiogenic shock. Tests and Procedures To Diagnose Shock and Its Underlying Causes Blood Pressure Test Medical personnel can use a simple blood pressure cuff and stethoscope to check whether a person has very low blood pressure. This is the most common sign of shock. A blood pressure test can be done before the person goes to a hospital. Less serious conditions also can cause low blood pressure, such as fainting or taking certain medicines, such as those used to treat high blood pressure. EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a simple test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart. Doctors use EKGs to diagnose severe heart attacks and monitor the heart's condition. Echocardiography Echocardiography (echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart. The test provides information about the size and shape of the heart and how well the heart chambers and valves are working. Echo also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow. Chest X Ray A chest x ray takes pictures of organs and structures in the chest, including the heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test shows whether the heart is enlarged or whether fluid is present in the lungs. These can be signs of cardiogenic shock. Cardiac Enzyme Test When cells in the heart die, they release enzymes into the blood. These enzymes are called markers or biomarkers. Measuring these markers can show whether the heart is damaged and the extent of the damage. Coronary Angiography Coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is an x-ray exam of the heart and blood vessels. The doctor passes a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) through an artery in the leg or arm to the heart. The catheter can measure the pressure inside the heart chambers. Dye that can be seen on an x-ray image is injected into the bloodstream through the tip of the catheter. The dye lets the doctor study the flow of blood through the heart and blood vessels and see any blockages. Pulmonary Artery Catheterization For this procedure, a catheter is inserted into a vein in the arm or neck or near the collarbone. Then, the catheter is moved into the pulmonary artery. This artery connects the right side of the heart to the lungs. The catheter is used to check blood pressure in the pulmonary artery. If the blood pressure is too high or too low, treatment may be needed. Blood Tests Some blood tests also are used to help diagnose cardiogenic shock, including: Arterial blood gas measurement. For this test, a blood sample is taken from an artery. The sample is used to measure oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH (acidity) levels in the blood. Certain levels of these substances are associated with shock. Tests that measure the function of various organs, such as the kidneys and liver. If these organs aren't working well, they may not be getting enough oxygen-rich blood. This could be a sign of cardiogenic shock."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Cardiogenic Shock ?","completion":"Cardiogenic shock is life threatening and requires emergency medical treatment. The condition usually is diagnosed after a person has been admitted to a hospital for a heart attack. If the person isn't already in a hospital, emergency treatment can start as soon as medical personnel arrive. The first goal of emergency treatment for cardiogenic shock is to improve the flow of blood and oxygen to the bodys organs. Sometimes both the shock and its cause are treated at the same time. For example, doctors may quickly open a blocked blood vessel that's damaging the heart. Often, this can get the patient out of shock with little or no additional treatment. Emergency Life Support Emergency life support treatment is needed for any type of shock. This treatment helps get oxygen-rich blood flowing to the brain, kidneys, and other organs. Restoring blood flow to the organs keeps the patient alive and may prevent long-term damage to the organs. Emergency life support treatment includes: Giving the patient extra oxygen to breathe so that more oxygen reaches the lungs, the heart, and the rest of the body. Providing breathing support if needed. A ventilator might be used to protect the airway and provide the patient with extra oxygen. A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing. Giving the patient fluids, including blood and blood products, through a needle inserted in a vein (when the shock is due to blood loss). This can help get more blood to major organs and the rest of the body. This treatment usually isnt used for cardiogenic shock because the heart can't pump the blood that's already in the body. Also, too much fluid is in the lungs, making it hard to breathe. Medicines During and after emergency life support treatment, doctors will try to find out whats causing the shock. If the reason for the shock is that the heart isn't pumping strongly enough, then the diagnosis is cardiogenic shock. Treatment for cardiogenic shock will depend on its cause. Doctors may prescribe medicines to: Prevent blood clots from forming Increase the force with which the heart muscle contracts Treat a heart attack Medical Devices Medical devices can help the heart pump and improve blood flow. Devices used to treat cardiogenic shock may include: An intra-aortic balloon pump. This device is placed in the aorta, the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the body. A balloon at the tip of the device is inflated and deflated in a rhythm that matches the hearts pumping rhythm. This allows the weakened heart muscle to pump as much blood as it can, which helps get more blood to vital organs, such as the brain and kidneys. A left ventricular assist device (LVAD). This device is a battery-operated pump that takes over part of the hearts pumping action. An LVAD helps the heart pump blood to the body. This device may be used if damage to the left ventricle, the hearts main pumping chamber, is causing shock. Medical Procedures and Surgery Sometimes medicines and medical devices aren't enough to treat cardiogenic shock. Medical procedures and surgery can restore blood flow to the heart and the rest of the body, repair heart damage, and help keep a patient alive while he or she recovers from shock. Surgery also can improve the chances of long-term survival. Surgery done within 6 hours of the onset of shock symptoms has the greatest chance of improving survival. The types of procedures and surgery used to treat underlying causes of cardiogenic shock include: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stents. PCI,also known as coronary angioplasty,is a procedure used to open narrowed or blocked coronary (heart) arteries and treat an ongoing heart attack. A stent is a small mesh tube that's placed in a coronary artery during PCI to help keep it open. Coronary artery bypass grafting. For this surgery, arteries or veins from other parts of the body are used to bypass (that is, go around) narrowed coronary arteries. This creates a new passage for oxygen-rich blood to reach the heart. Surgery to repair damaged heart valves. Surgery to repair a break in the wall that separates the hearts chambers. This break is called a septal rupture. Heart transplant. This type of surgery rarely is done during an emergency situation like cardiogenic shock because of other available options. Also, doctors need to do very careful testing to make sure a patient will benefit from a heart transplant and to find a matching heart from a donor. Still, in some cases, doctors may recommend a transplant if they feel it's the best way to improve a patient's chances of long-term survival."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Cardiogenic Shock ?","completion":"The best way to prevent cardiogenic shock is to lower your risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart attack. (For more information, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \\"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\\") If you already have CHD, its important to get ongoing treatment from a doctor who has experience treating heart problems. If you have a heart attack, you should get treatment right away to try to prevent cardiogenic shock and other possible complications. Act in time. Know the warning signs of a heart attack so you can act fast to get treatment. Many heart attack victims wait 2 hours or more after their symptoms begin before they seek medical help. Delays in treatment increase the risk of complications and death. If you think you're having a heart attack, call 911 for help. Don't drive yourself or have friends or family drive you to the hospital. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room."},{"prompt":"What causes Heart Disease in Women ?","completion":"Research suggests thatcoronary heart disease(CHD) begins with damage to the lining and inner layers of the coronary (heart) arteries. Several factors contribute to this damage. They include: Smoking, including secondhand smoke High amounts of certain fats andcholesterol in the blood High blood pressure High amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes Blood vessel inflammation Plaque may begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. The buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries may start in childhood. Over time, plaque can harden or rupture (break open). Hardened plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart. This can cause chest pain or discomfort calledangina. If the plaque ruptures, blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) stick to the site of the injury. They may clump together to form blood clots. Blood clots can further narrow the coronary arteries and worsenangina. If a clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block a coronary artery and cause a heart attack. In addition to the factors above, low estrogen levels before or after menopause may play a role in causingcoronary microvascular disease(MVD). Coronary MVD is heart disease that affects the heart's tiny arteries. The cause of broken heart syndrome isn't yet known. However, a sudden release of stress hormones may play a role in causing the disorder. Most cases of broken heart syndrome occur in women who have gone through menopause."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Heart Disease in Women? ?","completion":"Certain traits, conditions, or habits may raise your risk forcoronary heart disease(CHD). These conditions are known as risk factors. Risk factors also increase the chance that existing CHD will worsen. Women generally have the same CHD risk factors as men. However, some risk factors may affect women differently than men. For example, diabetes raises the risk of CHD more in women. Also, some risk factors, such as birth control pills and menopause, only affect women. There are many known CHD risk factors. Your risk for CHD andheart attackrises with the number of risk factors you have and their severity. Risk factors tend to \\"gang up\\" and worsen each other's effects. Having just one risk factor doubles your risk for CHD. Having two risk factors increases your risk for CHD fourfold. Having three or more risk factors increases your risk for CHD more than tenfold. Also, some risk factors, such as smoking and diabetes, put you at greater risk for CHD and heart attack than others. More than 75 percent of women aged 40 to 60 have one or more risk factors for CHD. Many risk factors start during childhood; some even develop within the first 10 years of life. You can control most risk factors, but some you can't. For more information about CHD risk factors, go to the Health Topics Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factorsarticle. To find out whether you're at risk for CHD, talk with your doctor or health care provider. Risk Factors You Can Control Smoking Smoking is the most powerful risk factor that women can control. Smoking tobacco or long-term exposure to secondhand smoke raises your risk for CHD and heart attack. Smoking exposes you to carbon monoxide. This chemical robs your blood of oxygen and triggers a buildup of plaque in your arteries. Smoking also increases the risk of blood clots forming in your arteries. Blood clots can block plaque-narrowed arteries and cause a heart attack. The more you smoke, the greater your risk for a heart attack. Even women who smoke fewer than two cigarettes a day are at increased risk for CHD. High Blood Cholesterol and High Triglyceride Levels Cholesterol travels in the bloodstream in small packages called lipoproteins (LI-po-pro-teens). The two major kinds of lipoproteins are low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. LDL cholesterol is sometimes called \\"bad\\" cholesterol. This is because it carries cholesterol to tissues, including your heart arteries. HDL cholesterol is sometimes called \\"good\\" cholesterol. This is because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. A blood test called a lipoprotein panel is used to measure cholesterol levels. This test gives information about your total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides (a type of fat found in the blood). Cholesterol levels are measured in milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dL) of blood. A woman's risk for CHD increases if she has a total cholesterol level greater than 200 mg/dL, an LDL cholesterol level greater than 100 mg/dL, or an HDL cholesterol level less than 50 mg/dL. A triglyceride level greater than 150 mg/dL also increases a woman's risk for CHD. A woman's HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels predict her risk for CHD better than her total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol levels. High Blood Pressure Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage the body in many ways. Women who have blood pressure greater than 120/80 mmHg are at increased risk for CHD. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.) High blood pressure is defined differently for people who have diabetes or chronic kidney disease. If you have one of these diseases, work with your doctor to set a healthy blood pressure goal. Diabetes and Prediabetes Diabetes is a disease in which the body's blood sugar level is too high. This is because the body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use its insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells, where it's used for energy. Over time, a high blood sugar level can lead to increased plaque buildup in your arteries. Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not as high as it is in diabetes. Prediabetes puts you at higher risk for both diabetes and CHD. Diabetes and prediabetes raise the risk of CHD more in women than in men. In fact, having diabetes doubles a woman's risk of developing CHD. Before menopause, estrogen provides women some protection against CHD. However, in women who have diabetes, the disease counters the protective effects of estrogen. Overweight and Obesity The terms \\"overweight\\" and \\"obesity\\" refer to body weight that's greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height. The most useful measure of overweight and obesity is body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated from your height and weight. In adults, a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight. A BMI of 30 or more is considered obese. You can use the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) online BMI calculator to figure out your BMI, or your doctor can help you. Studies suggest that where extra weight occurs on the body may predict CHD risk better than BMI. Women who carry much of their fat around the waist are at greatest risk for CHD. These women have \\"apple-shaped\\" figures. Women who carry most of their fat on their hips and thighsthat is, those who have \\"pear-shaped\\" figuresare at lower risk for CHD. To fully know how excess weight affects your CHD risk, you should know your BMI and waist measurement. If you have a BMI greater than 24.9 and a waist measurement greater than 35 inches, you're at increased risk for CHD. If your waist measurement divided by your hip measurement is greater than 0.9, you're also at increased risk for CHD. Studies also suggest that women whose weight goes up and down dramatically (typically due to unhealthy dieting) are at increased risk for CHD. These swings in weight can lower HDL cholesterol levels. Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndromeis the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for CHD and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke. A diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is made if you have at least three of the following risk factors: A large waistline. Having extra fat in the waist area is a greater risk factor for CHD than having extra fat in other parts of the body, such as on the hips. A higher than normal triglyceride level (or you're on medicine to treat high triglycerides). A lower than normal HDL cholesterol level (or you're on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol). Higher than normal blood pressure (or you're on medicine to treat high blood pressure). Higher than normal fasting blood sugar (or you're on medicine to treat diabetes) Metabolic syndrome is more common in African American women and Mexican American women than in men of the same racial groups. The condition affects White women and men about equally. Birth Control Pills Women who smoke and take birth control pills are at very high risk for CHD, especially if they're older than 35. For women who take birth control pills but don't smoke, the risk of CHD isn't fully known. Lack of Physical Activity Inactive people are nearly twice as likely to develop CHD as those who are physically active. A lack of physical activity can worsen other CHD risk factors, such as high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, diabetes and prediabetes, and overweight and obesity. Unhealthy Diet An unhealthy diet can raise your risk for CHD. For example, foods that are high in saturated and trans fats and cholesterol raise your LDL cholesterol level. A high-sodium (salt) diet can raise your risk for high blood pressure. Foods with added sugars will give you extra calories without nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals. This can cause you to gain weight, which raises your risk for CHD. Too much alcohol also can cause you to gain weight, and it will raise your blood pressure. Stress or Depression Stress may play a role in causing CHD. Stress can trigger your arteries to narrow. This can raise your blood pressure and your risk for a heart attack. Getting upset or angry also can trigger a heart attack. Stress also may indirectly raise your risk for CHD if it makes you more likely to smoke or overeat foods high in fat and sugar. People who are depressed are two to three times more likely to develop CHD than people who are not. Depression is twice as common in women as in men. Anemia Anemia (uh-NEE-me-eh) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. The condition also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your organs. If you have anemia, your organs don't get enough oxygen-rich blood. This causes your heart to work harder, which may raise your risk for CHD. Anemia has many causes. For more information, go to the Health Topics Anemiaarticle. Sleep Apnea Sleep apneais a common disorder that causes pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They often occur 5 to 30 times or more an hour. Typically, normal breathing starts again after the pause, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound. Major signs of sleep apnea are snoring and daytime sleepiness. When you stop breathing, the lack of oxygen triggers your body's stress hormones. This causes blood pressure to rise and makes the blood more likely to clot. Untreated sleep apnea can raise your risk for high blood pressure, diabetes, and even a heart attack or stroke. Women are more likely to develop sleep apnea after menopause. Risk Factors You Can't Control Age and Menopause As you get older, your risk for CHD and heart attack rises. This is due in part to the slow buildup of plaque inside your heart arteries, which can start during childhood. Before age 55, women have a lower risk for CHD than men. Estrogen provides women with some protection against CHD before menopause. After age 55, however, the risk of CHD increases in both women and men. You may have gone through early menopause, either naturally or because you had your ovaries removed. If so, you're twice as likely to develop CHD as women of the same age who aren't yet menopausal. Another reason why women are at increased risk for CHD after age 55 is that middle age is when you tend to develop other CHD risk factors. Women who have gone through menopause also are at increased risk for broken heart syndrome. (For more information, go to the section on emerging risk factors below.) Family History Family history plays a role in CHD risk. Your risk increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with CHD before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with CHD before 65 years of age. Also, a family history of strokeespecially a mother's stroke historycan help predict the risk of heart attack in women. Having a family history of CHD or stroke doesn't mean that you'll develop heart disease. This is especially true if your affected family member smoked or had other risk factors that were not well treated. Making lifestyle changes and taking medicines to treat risk factors often can lessen genetic influences and prevent or delay heart problems. Preeclampsia Preeclampsia (pre-e-KLAMP-se-ah) is a condition that develops during pregnancy. The two main signs of preeclampsia are a rise in blood pressure and excess protein in the urine. These signs usually occur during the second half of pregnancy and go away after delivery. However, your risk of developing high blood pressure later in life increases after having preeclampsia. Preeclampsia also is linked to an increased lifetime risk of heart disease, including CHD, heart attack, and heart failure. (Likewise, having heart disease risk factors, such as diabetes or obesity, increases your risk for preeclampsia.) If you had preeclampsia during pregnancy, you're twice as likely to develop heart disease as women who haven't had the condition. You're also more likely to develop heart disease earlier in life. Preeclampsia is a heart disease risk factor that you can't control. However, if you've had the condition, you should take extra care to try and control other heart disease risk factors. The more severe your preeclampsia was, the greater your risk for heart disease. Let your doctor know that you had preeclampsia so he or she can assess your heart disease risk and how to reduce it. Emerging Risk Factors Research suggests that inflammation plays a role in causing CHD. Inflammation is the body's response to injury or infection. Damage to the arteries' inner walls seems to trigger inflammation and help plaque grow. High blood levels of a protein called C-reactive protein (CRP) are a sign of inflammation in the body. Research suggests that women who have high blood levels of CRP are at increased risk for heart attack. Also, some inflammatory diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, may increase the risk for CHD. Some studies suggest that women who have migraine headaches may be at greater risk for CHD. This is especially true for women who have migraines with auras (visual disturbances), such as flashes of light or zig-zag lines. Low bone density and low intake of folate and vitamin B6 also may raise a woman's risk for CHD. More research is needed to find out whether calcium supplements with or without vitamin D affect CHD risk. You may want to talk with your doctor to find out whether these types of supplements are right for you. Researchers are just starting to learn about broken heart syndrome risk factors. Most women who have this disorder are White and have gone through menopause. Many of these women have other heart disease risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking. However, these risk factors tend to be less common in women who have broken heart syndrome than in women who have CHD."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Heart Disease in Women ?","completion":"The signs and symptoms ofcoronary heart disease(CHD) may differ between women and men. Some women who have CHD have no signs or symptoms. This is called silent CHD. Silent CHD may not be diagnosed until a woman has signs and symptoms of aheart attack, heart failure, or an arrhythmia(irregular heartbeat). Other women who have CHD will have signs and symptoms of the disease. Heart Disease Signs and Symptoms A common symptom of CHD isangina.Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. In men, angina often feels like pressure or squeezing in the chest. This feeling may extend to the arms. Women can also have these angina symptoms. But women also tend to describe a sharp, burning chest pain. Women are more likely to have pain in the neck, jaw, throat, abdomen, or back. In men, angina tends to worsen with physical activity and go away with rest. Women are more likely than men to have angina while they're resting or sleeping. In women who havecoronary microvascular disease, angina often occurs during routine daily activities, such as shopping or cooking, rather than while exercising. Mental stress also is more likely to trigger angina pain in women than in men. The severity of angina varies. The pain may get worse or occur more often as the buildup of plaque continues to narrow the coronary (heart) arteries. Signs and Symptoms Coronary Heart Disease Complications Heart Attack The most common heart attack symptom in men and women is chest pain or discomfort. However, only half of women who have heart attacks have chest pain. Women are more likely than men to report back or neck pain, indigestion, heartburn, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), vomiting, extreme fatigue (tiredness), or problems breathing. Heart attacks also can cause upper body discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach. Other heart attack symptoms are light-headedness and dizziness, which occur more often in women than men. Men are more likely than women to break out in a cold sweat and to report pain in the left arm during a heart attack. Heart Failure Heart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. Heart failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. It means that your heart can't cope with the demands of everyday activities. Heart failure causes shortness of breath and fatigue that tends to increase with physical exertion. Heart failure also can cause swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, abdomen, and veins in the neck. Arrhythmia An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. Some people describe arrhythmias as fluttering or thumping feelings or skipped beats in their chests. These feelings are calledpalpitations. Some arrhythmias can cause your heart to suddenly stop beating. This condition is calledsudden cardiac arrest(SCA). SCA causes loss of consciousness and death if it's not treated right away. Signs and Symptoms of Broken Heart Syndrome The most common signs and symptoms of broken heart syndrome are chest pain and shortness of breath. In this disorder, these symptoms tend to occur suddenly in people who have no history of heart disease. Arrhythmias orcardiogenic shockalso may occur. Cardiogenic shock is a condition in which a suddenly weakened heart isn't able to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Some of the signs and symptoms of broken heart syndrome differ from those of heart attack. For example, in people who have broken heart syndrome: Symptoms occur suddenly after having extreme emotional or physical stress. EKG (electrocardiogram) results don't look the same as the EKG results for a person having a heart attack. (An EKG is a test that records the heart's electrical activity.) Blood tests show no signs or mild signs of heart damage. Tests show no signs of blockages in the coronary arteries. Tests show ballooning and unusual movement of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle). Recovery time is quick, usually within days or weeks (compared with the recovery time of a month or more for a heart attack)."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Heart Disease in Women ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnosecoronary heart disease(CHD) based on your medical and family histories, your risk factors, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures. No single test can diagnose CHD. If your doctor thinks you have CHD, he or she may recommend one or more of the following tests. EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKGis a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart. An EKG can show signs of heart damage due to CHD and signs of a previous or current heart attack. Stress Testing Duringstress testing,you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicines to increase your heart rate. When your heart is working hard and beating fast, it needs more blood and oxygen. Plaque-narrowed coronary (heart) arteries can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your heart's needs. A stress test can show possible signs and symptoms of CHD, such as: Abnormal changes in your heart rate or blood pressure Shortness of breath or chest pain Abnormal changes in your heart rhythm or your heart's electrical activity If you can't exercise for as long as what is considered normal for someone your age, your heart may not be getting enough oxygen-rich blood. However, other factors also can prevent you from exercising long enough (for example, lung diseases,anemia, or poor general fitness). As part of some stress tests, pictures are taken of your heart while you exercise and while you rest. These imaging stress tests can show how well blood is flowing in your heart and how well your heart pumps blood when it beats. Echocardiography Echocardiography (echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The test provides information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working. Echo also can show areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow. Chest X Ray Achest x raycreates pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can reveal signs ofheart failure, as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to CHD. Blood Tests Blood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood. Abnormal levels may be a sign that you're at risk for CHD. Blood tests also help detectanemia,a risk factor for CHD. During a heart attack, heart muscle cells die and release proteins into the bloodstream. Blood tests can measure the amount of these proteins in the bloodstream. High levels of these proteins are a sign of a recent heart attack. Coronary Angiography and Cardiac Catheterization Your doctor may recommendcoronary angiography(an-jee-OG-rah-fee) if other tests or factors suggest you have CHD. This test uses dye and special x rays to look inside your coronary arteries. To get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure calledcardiac catheterization(KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun). A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream. Special x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels. Coronary angiography detects blockages in the large coronary arteries. However, the test doesn't detectcoronary microvascular disease(MVD). This is because coronary MVD doesn't cause blockages in the large coronary arteries. Even if the results of your coronary angiography are normal, you may still have chest pain or other CHD symptoms. If so, talk with your doctor about whether you might have coronary MVD. Your doctor may ask you to fill out a questionnaire called the Duke Activity Status Index. This questionnaire measures how easily you can do routine tasks. It gives your doctor information about how well blood is flowing through your coronary arteries. Your doctor also may recommend other tests that measure blood flow in the heart, such as acardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) stress test. Cardiac MRI uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create pictures of your heart as it beats. The test produces both still and moving pictures of your heart and major blood vessels. Other tests done during cardiac catheterization can check blood flow in the heart's small arteries and the thickness of the artery walls. Tests Used To Diagnose Broken Heart Syndrome If your doctor thinks you have broken heart syndrome, he or she may recommend coronary angiography. Other tests are also used to diagnose this disorder, including blood tests, EKG, echo, and cardiac MRI."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Heart Disease in Women ?","completion":"Treatment forcoronary heart disease (CHD) usually is the same for both women and men. Treatment may include lifestyle changes, medicines, medical and surgical procedures, andcardiac rehabilitation(rehab). The goals of treatment are to: Relieve symptoms. Reduce risk factors in an effort to slow, stop, or reverse the buildup of plaque. Lower the risk of blood clots forming. (Blood clots can cause aheart attack.) Widen or bypass plaque-clogged coronary (heart) arteries. Prevent CHD complications. Lifestyle Changes Making lifestyle changes can help prevent or treat CHD. These changes may be the only treatment that some people need. Quit Smoking If you smoke or use tobacco, try to quit. Smoking can raise your risk for CHD and heart attack and worsen other CHD risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you find it hard to quit smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) \\"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\\" Follow a Healthy Diet A healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. A healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits. These foods can be fresh, canned, frozen, or dried. A good rule is to try to fill half of your plate with vegetables and fruits. A healthy diet also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, processed soy products, nuts, seeds, beans, and peas. Choose and prepare foods with little sodium (salt). Too much salt can raise your risk for high blood pressure. Studies show that following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan can lower blood pressure. Try to avoid foods and drinks that are high in added sugars. For example, drink water instead of sugary drinks, like soda. Also, try to limit the amount of solid fats and refined grains that you eat. Solid fats are saturated fat and trans fatty acids. Refined grains come from processing whole grains, which results in a loss of nutrients (such as dietary fiber). If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. Research suggests that regularly drinking small to moderate amounts of alcohol may lower the risk of CHD. Women should have no more than one alcoholic drink a day. One drink a day can lower your CHD risk by raising your HDL cholesterol level. One drink is a glass of wine, beer, or a small amount of hard liquor. If you don't drink, this isn't a recommendation to start using alcohol. Also, you shouldn't drink if you're pregnant, if you're planning to become pregnant, or if you have another health condition that could make alcohol use harmful. Too much alcohol can cause you to gain weight and raise your blood pressure and triglyceride level. In women, even one drink a day may raise the risk of certain types of cancer. For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBI's \\"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH\\" and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating. Be Physically Active Regular physical activity can lower many CHD risk factors, including high LDL cholesterol,high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. (HDL cholesterol helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.) Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask him or her how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. People gain health benefits from as little as 60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. Walking is an excellent heart healthy exercise. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. For more information about physical activity, go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' \\"2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,\\" the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article, and the NHLBI's \\"Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.\\" Maintain a Healthy Weight Overweight and obesity are risk factors for CHD. If you're overweight or obese, try to lose weight. Cut back your calorie intake and do more physical activity. Eat smaller portions and choose lower calorie foods. Your health care provider may refer you to a dietitian to help you manage your weight. A BMI of less than 25 and a waist circumference of 35 inches or less is the goal for preventing and treating CHD. BMI measures your weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. You can use the NHLBI's online BMI calculator to figure out your BMI, or your doctor can help you. To measure your waist, stand and place a tape measure around your middle, just above your hipbones. Measure your waist just after you breathe out. Make sure the tape is snug but doesn't squeeze the flesh. For more information about losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight, go to the NHLBI's Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site. Stress and Depression Research shows that getting upset or angry can trigger a heart attack. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingaren't heart healthy. Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Having supportive people in your life with whom you can share your feelings or concerns can help relieve stress. Physical activity, yoga, and relaxation therapy also can help relieve stress. You may want to consider taking part in a stress management program. Depression can double or triple your risk for CHD. Depression also makes it hard to maintain a heart healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor if you have symptoms of depression, such as feeling hopeless or not taking interest in daily activities. He or she may recommend counseling or prescribe medicines to help you manage the condition. Medicines You may need medicines to treat CHD if lifestyle changes aren't enough. Medicines can help: Reduce your heart's workload and relieve CHD symptoms Decrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly Lower your LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and other CHD risk factors Prevent blood clots Prevent or delay the need for a procedure or surgery, such asangioplasty (AN-jee-oh-plas-tee) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) Women who havecoronary microvascular disease and anemiamay benefit from taking medicine to treat the anemia. Women who have broken heart syndrome also may need medicines. Doctors may prescribe medicines to relieve fluid buildup, treat blood pressure problems, prevent blood clots, and manage stress hormones. Most people who have broken heart syndrome make a full recovery within weeks. Take all of your medicines as prescribed. If you have side effects or other problems related to your medicines, tell your doctor. He or she may be able to provide other options. Menopausal Hormone Therapy Recent studies have shown that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) doesn't prevent CHD. Some studies have even shown that MHT increases women's risk for CHD, stroke, and breast cancer. However, these studies tested MHT on women who had been postmenopausal for at least several years. During that time, they could have already developed CHD. Research is ongoing to see whether MHT helps prevent CHD when taken right when menopause starts. While questions remain, current findings suggest MHT shouldn't routinely be used to prevent or treat CHD. Ask your doctor about other ways to prevent or treat CHD, including lifestyle changes and medicines. For more information about MHT, go to the NHLBI's Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy Web site. Procedures and Surgery You may need a procedure or surgery to treat CHD. Both angioplasty and CABG are used as treatments. You and your doctor can discuss which treatment is right for you. Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), commonly known as angioplasty (AN-jee-oh-plas-tee), is a nonsurgical procedure that opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. A thin, flexible tube with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to compress the plaque against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery. PCI can improve blood flow to your heart and relieve chest pain. A small mesh tube called a stent usually is placed in the artery to help keep it open after the procedure. For more information, go to the Health Topics PCI article. Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting CABG is a type of surgery. During CABG, a surgeon removes arteries or veins from other areas in your body and uses them to bypass (that is, go around) narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. CABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack. For more information, go to the Health Topics Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting article. Cardiac Rehabilitation Your doctor may prescribe cardiac rehab foranginaor after angioplasty, CABG, or a heart attack. Almost everyone who has CHD can benefit from cardiac rehab. Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that can improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems. The cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists. Cardiac rehab has two parts: Exercise training. This part of rehab helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests. Education, counseling, and training.

Your risk for CHD increases with the number of CHD risk factors you have. One step you can take is to adopt a heart healthy lifestyle. A heart healthy lifestyle should be part of a lifelong approach to healthy living. For example, if you smoke, try to quit. Smoking can raise your risk for CHD andheart attackand worsen other CHD risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. For more information about quitting smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) \\"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\\" Following a healthy diet also is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. A healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits. It also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, processed soy products, nuts, seeds, beans, and peas. A healthy diet is low in sodium (salt), added sugars, solid fats, and refined grains. Solid fats are saturated fat and trans fatty acids. Refined grains come from processing whole grains, which results in a loss of nutrients (such as dietary fiber). The NHLBI's Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) are two programs that promote healthy eating. If you'reoverweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan. Controlling your weight helps you control CHD risk factors. Be as physically active as you can. Physical activity can improve your fitness level and your health. Talk with your doctor about what types of activity are safe for you. For more information about physical activity, go to the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article and the NHLBI's \\"Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.\\" Know your family history of CHD. If you or someone in your family has CHD, be sure to tell your doctor. If lifestyle changes aren't enough, you also may need medicines to control your CHD risk factors. Take all of your medicines as prescribed. For more information about lifestyle changes and medicines, go to \\"How Is Heart Disease Treated?\\""},{"prompt":"What is (are) Anemia ?","completion":"Espaol Anemia (uh-NEE-me-uh) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. This protein helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. If you have anemia, your body doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. As a result, you may feel tired or weak. You also may have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or headaches. Severe or long-lasting anemia can damage your heart, brain, and other organs in your body. Very severe anemia may even cause death. Overview Blood is made up of many parts, including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets (PLATE-lets), and plasma (the fluid portion of blood). Red blood cells are disc-shaped and look like doughnuts without holes in the center. They carry oxygen and remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from your body. These cells are made in the bone marrowa sponge-like tissue inside the bones. White blood cells and platelets (PLATE-lets) also are made in the bone marrow. White blood cells help fight infection. Platelets stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on the blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. With some types of anemia, you may have low numbers of all three types of blood cells. Anemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, or high rates of red blood cell destruction. These causes might be the result of diseases, conditions, or other factors. Outlook Many types of anemia can be mild, short term, and easily treated. You can even prevent some types with a healthy diet. Other types can be treated with dietary supplements. However, certain types of anemia can be severe, long lasting, and even life threatening if not diagnosed and treated. If you have signs or symptoms of anemia, see your doctor to find out whether you have the condition. Treatment will depend on the cause of the anemia and how severe it is."},{"prompt":"What causes Anemia ?","completion":"The three main causes of anemia are: Blood loss Lack of red blood cell production High rates of red blood cell destruction For some people, the condition is caused by more than one of these factors. Blood Loss Blood loss is the most common cause of anemia, especially iron-deficiency anemia. Blood loss can be short term or persist over time. Heavy menstrual periods or bleeding in the digestive or urinary tract can cause blood loss. Surgery, trauma, or cancer also can cause blood loss. If a lot of blood is lost, the body may lose enough red blood cells to cause anemia. Lack of Red Blood Cell Production Both acquired and inherited conditions and factors can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. \\"Acquired\\" means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it. \\"Inherited\\" means your parents passed the gene for the condition on to you. Acquired conditions and factors that can lead to anemia include poor diet, abnormal hormone levels, some chronic (ongoing) diseases, and pregnancy. Aplastic anemia also can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. This condition can be acquired or inherited. Diet A diet that lacks iron, folic acid (folate), or vitamin B12 can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. Your body also needs small amounts of vitamin C, riboflavin, and copper to make red blood cells. Conditions that make it hard for your body to absorb nutrients also can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. Hormones Your body needs the hormone erythropoietin (eh-rith-ro-POY-eh-tin) to make red blood cells. This hormone stimulates the bone marrow to make these cells. A low level of this hormone can lead to anemia. Diseases and Disease Treatments Chronic diseases, like kidney disease and cancer, can make it hard for your body to make enough red blood cells. Some cancer treatments may damage the bone marrow or damage the red blood cells' ability to carry oxygen. If the bone marrow is damaged, it can't make red blood cells fast enough to replace the ones that die or are destroyed. People who have HIV/AIDS may develop anemia due to infections or medicines used to treat their diseases. Pregnancy Anemia can occur during pregnancy due to low levels of iron and folic acid and changes in the blood. During the first 6 months of pregnancy, the fluid portion of a woman's blood (the plasma) increases faster than the number of red blood cells. This dilutes the blood and can lead to anemia. Aplastic Anemia Some infants are born without the ability to make enough red blood cells. This condition is called aplastic anemia. Infants and children who have aplastic anemia often need blood transfusions to increase the number of red blood cells in their blood. Acquired conditions or factors, such as certain medicines, toxins, and infectious diseases, also can cause aplastic anemia. High Rates of Red Blood Cell Destruction Both acquired and inherited conditions and factors can cause your body to destroy too many red blood cells. One example of an acquired condition is an enlarged or diseased spleen. The spleen is an organ that removes wornout red blood cells from the body. If the spleen is enlarged or diseased, it may remove more red blood cells than normal, causing anemia. Examples of inherited conditions that can cause your body to destroy too many red blood cells include sickle cell anemia, thalassemias, and lack of certain enzymes. These conditions create defects in the red blood cells that cause them to die faster than healthy red blood cells. Hemolytic anemia is another example of a condition in which your body destroys too many red blood cells. Inherited or acquired conditions or factors can cause hemolytic anemia. Examples include immune disorders, infections, certain medicines, or reactions to blood transfusions."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Anemia? ?","completion":"Anemia is a common condition. It occurs in all age, racial, and ethnic groups. Both men and women can have anemia. However, women of childbearing age are at higher risk for the condition because of blood loss from menstruation. Anemia can develop during pregnancy due to low levels of iron and folic acid (folate) and changes in the blood. During the first 6 months of pregnancy, the fluid portion of a woman's blood (the plasma) increases faster than the number of red blood cells. This dilutes the blood and can lead to anemia. During the first year of life, some babies are at risk for anemia because of iron deficiency. At-risk infants include those who are born too early and infants who are fed breast milk only or formula that isn't fortified with iron. These infants can develop iron deficiency by 6 months of age. Infants between 1 and 2 years of age also are at risk for anemia. They may not get enough iron in their diets, especially if they drink a lot of cow's milk. Cow's milk is low in the iron needed for growth. Drinking too much cow's milk may keep an infant or toddler from eating enough iron-rich foods or absorbing enough iron from foods. Older adults also are at increased risk for anemia. Researchers continue to study how the condition affects older adults. Many of these people have other medical conditions as well. Major Risk Factors Factors that raise your risk for anemia include: A diet that is low in iron, vitamins, or minerals Blood loss from surgery or an injury Long-term or serious illnesses, such as kidney disease, cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV/AIDS, inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease), liver disease, heart failure, and thyroid disease Long-term infections A family history of inherited anemia, such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia"},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Anemia ?","completion":"The most common symptom of anemia is fatigue (feeling tired or weak). If you have anemia, you may find it hard to find the energy to do normal activities. Other signs and symptoms of anemia include: Shortness of breath Dizziness Headache Coldness in the hands and feet Pale skin Chest pain These signs and symptoms can occur because your heart has to work harder to pump oxygen-rich blood through your body. Mild to moderate anemia may cause very mild symptoms or none at all. Complications of Anemia Some people who have anemia may have arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs). Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. Over time, arrhythmias can damage your heart and possibly lead to heart failure. Anemia also can damage other organs in your body because your blood can't get enough oxygen to them. Anemia can weaken people who have cancer or HIV/AIDS. This can make their treatments not work as well. Anemia also can cause many other health problems. People who have kidney disease and anemia are more likely to have heart problems. With some types of anemia, too little fluid intake or too much loss of fluid in the blood and body can occur. Severe loss of fluid can be life threatening."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Anemia ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose anemia based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and results from tests and procedures. Because anemia doesn't always cause symptoms, your doctor may find out you have it while checking for another condition. Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask whether you have any of the common signs or symptoms of anemia. He or she also may ask whether you've had an illness or condition that could cause anemia. Let your doctor know about any medicines you take, what you typically eat (your diet), and whether you have family members who have anemia or a history of it. Physical Exam Your doctor will do a physical exam to find out how severe your anemia is and to check for possible causes. He or she may: Listen to your heart for a rapid or irregular heartbeat Listen to your lungs for rapid or uneven breathing Feel your abdomen to check the size of your liver and spleen Your doctor also may do a pelvic or rectal exam to check for common sources of blood loss. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures You may have various blood tests and other tests or procedures to find out what type of anemia you have and how severe it is. Complete Blood Count Often, the first test used to diagnose anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures many parts of your blood. The test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is the iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia. The normal range of these levels might be lower in certain racial and ethnic populations. Your doctor can explain your test results to you. The CBC also checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Abnormal results might be a sign of anemia, another blood disorder, an infection, or another condition. Finally, the CBC looks at mean corpuscular (kor-PUS-kyu-lar) volume (MCV). MCV is a measure of the average size of your red blood cells and a clue as to the cause of your anemia. In iron-deficiency anemia, for example, red blood cells usually are smaller than normal. Other Tests and Procedures If the CBC results show that you have anemia, you may need other tests, such as: Hemoglobin electrophoresis (e-lek-tro-FOR-e-sis). This test looks at the different types of hemoglobin in your blood. The test can help diagnose the type of anemia you have. A reticulocyte (re-TIK-u-lo-site) count. This test measures the number of young red blood cells in your blood. The test shows whether your bone marrow is making red blood cells at the correct rate. Tests for the level of iron in your blood and body. These tests include serum iron and serum ferritin tests. Transferrin level and total iron-binding capacity tests also measure iron levels. Because anemia has many causes, you also might be tested for conditions such as kidney failure, lead poisoning (in children), and vitamin deficiencies (lack of vitamins, such as B12 and folic acid). If your doctor thinks that you have anemia due to internal bleeding, he or she may suggest several tests to look for the source of the bleeding. A test to check the stool for blood might be done in your doctor's office or at home. Your doctor can give you a kit to help you get a sample at home. He or she will tell you to bring the sample back to the office or send it to a laboratory. If blood is found in the stool, you may have other tests to find the source of the bleeding. One such test is endoscopy (en-DOS-ko-pe). For this test, a tube with a tiny camera is used to view the lining of the digestive tract. Your doctor also may want to do bone marrow tests. These tests show whether your bone marrow is healthy and making enough blood cells."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Anemia ?","completion":"Treatment for anemia depends on the type, cause, and severity of the condition. Treatments may include dietary changes or supplements, medicines, procedures, or surgery to treat blood loss. Goals of Treatment The goal of treatment is to increase the amount of oxygen that your blood can carry. This is done by raising the red blood cell count and/or hemoglobin level. (Hemoglobin is the iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body.) Another goal is to treat the underlying cause of the anemia. Dietary Changes and Supplements Low levels of vitamins or iron in the body can cause some types of anemia. These low levels might be the result of a poor diet or certain diseases or conditions. To raise your vitamin or iron level, your doctor may ask you to change your diet or take vitamin or iron supplements. Common vitamin supplements are vitamin B12 and folic acid (folate). Vitamin C sometimes is given to help the body absorb iron. Iron Your body needs iron to make hemoglobin. Your body can more easily absorb iron from meats than from vegetables or other foods. To treat your anemia, your doctor may suggest eating more meatespecially red meat (such as beef or liver), as well as chicken, turkey, pork, fish, and shellfish. Nonmeat foods that are good sources of iron include: Spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables Tofu Peas; lentils; white, red, and baked beans; soybeans; and chickpeas Dried fruits, such as prunes, raisins, and apricots Prune juice Iron-fortified cereals and breads You can look at the Nutrition Facts label on packaged foods to find out how much iron the items contain. The amount is given as a percentage of the total amount of iron you need every day. Iron also is available as a supplement. It's usually combined with multivitamins and other minerals that help your body absorb iron. Doctors may recommend iron supplements for premature infants, infants and young children who drink a lot of cow's milk, and infants who are fed breast milk only or formula that isn't fortified with iron. Large amounts of iron can be harmful, so take iron supplements only as your doctor prescribes. Vitamin B12 Low levels of vitamin B12 can lead to pernicious anemia. This type of anemia often is treated with vitamin B12 supplements. Good food sources of vitamin B12 include: Breakfast cereals with added vitamin B12 Meats such as beef, liver, poultry, and fish Eggs and dairy products (such as milk, yogurt, and cheese) Foods fortified with vitamin B12, such as soy-based beverages and vegetarian burgers Folic Acid Folic acid (folate) is a form of vitamin B that's found in foods. Your body needs folic acid to make and maintain new cells. Folic acid also is very important for pregnant women. It helps them avoid anemia and promotes healthy growth of the fetus. Good sources of folic acid include: Bread, pasta, and rice with added folic acid Spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables Black-eyed peas and dried beans Beef liver Eggs Bananas, oranges, orange juice, and some other fruits and juices Vitamin C Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron. Good sources of vitamin C are vegetables and fruits, especially citrus fruits. Citrus fruits include oranges, grapefruits, tangerines, and similar fruits. Fresh and frozen fruits, vegetables, and juices usually have more vitaminC than canned ones. If you're taking medicines, ask your doctor or pharmacist whether you can eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice. This fruit can affect the strength of a few medicines and how well they work. Other fruits rich in vitamin C include kiwi fruit, strawberries, and cantaloupes. Vegetables rich in vitamin C include broccoli, peppers, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, cabbage, potatoes, and leafy green vegetables like turnip greens and spinach. Medicines Your doctor may prescribe medicines to help your body make more red blood cells or to treat an underlying cause of anemia. Some of these medicines include: Antibiotics to treat infections. Hormones to treat heavy menstrual bleeding in teenaged and adult women. A man-made version of erythropoietin to stimulate your body to make more red blood cells. This hormone has some risks. You and your doctor will decide whether the benefits of this treatment outweigh the risks. Medicines to prevent the body's immune system from destroying its own red blood cells. Chelation (ke-LAY-shun) therapy for lead poisoning. Chelation therapy is used mainly in children. This is because children who have iron-deficiency anemia are at increased risk of lead poisoning. Procedures If your anemia is severe, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure. Procedures include blood transfusions and blood and marrow stem cell transplants. Blood Transfusion A blood transfusion is a safe, common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels. Transfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood. For more information, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article. Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant A blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces your faulty stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor). Stem cells are made in the bone marrow. They develop into red and white blood cells and platelets. During the transplant, which is like a blood transfusion, you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein in your chest. Once the stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells. For more information, go to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article. Surgery If you have serious or life-threatening bleeding that's causing anemia, you may need surgery. For example, you may need surgery to control ongoing bleeding due to a stomach ulcer or colon cancer. If your body is destroying red blood cells at a high rate, you may need to have your spleen removed. The spleen is an organ that removes wornout red blood cells from the body. An enlarged or diseased spleen may remove more red blood cells than normal, causing anemia."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Anemia ?","completion":"You might be able to prevent repeat episodes of some types of anemia, especially those caused by lack of iron or vitamins. Dietary changes or supplements can prevent these types of anemia from occurring again. Treating anemia's underlying cause may prevent the condition (or prevent repeat episodes). For example, if medicine is causing your anemia, your doctor may prescribe another type of medicine. To prevent anemia from getting worse, tell your doctor about all of your signs and symptoms. Talk with your doctor about the tests you may need and follow your treatment plan. You can't prevent some types of inherited anemia, such as sickle cell anemia. If you have an inherited anemia, talk with your doctor about treatment and ongoing care."},{"prompt":"What is (are) AsbestosRelated Lung Diseases ?","completion":"Asbestos-related lung diseases are diseases caused by exposure to asbestos (as-BES-tos) fibers. Asbestos is a mineral that, in the past, was widely used in many industries. Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers that can escape into the air. When breathed in, these fibers can stay in your lungs for a long time. If the fibers build up in your lungs, they can lead to: Pleural plaque. In this condition, the tissue around the lungs and diaphragm (the muscle below your lungs) thickens and hardens. This tissue is called the pleura. Pleural plaque usually causes no symptoms. Rarely, as the pleura thickens, it can trap and compress part of the lung. This may show up as a mass on an x-ray image. Pleural effusion. In this condition, excess fluid builds up in the pleural space. The pleural space is the area between the lungs and the chest wall. Asbestosis (as-bes-TOE-sis). In this condition, the lung tissue becomes scarred. People who have asbestosis are at greater risk for lung cancer, especially if they smoke. Lung cancer. This type of cancer forms in the lung tissue, usually in the cells lining the air passages. Mesothelioma (MEZ-o-thee-lee-O-ma). This disease is cancer of the pleura. Asbestos also can cause cancer in the lining of the abdominal cavity. This lining is known as the peritoneum (PER-ih-to-NE-um). Asbestos-Related Lung Diseases Overview Until the 1970s, asbestos was widely used in many industries in the United States. For example, it was used to insulate pipes, boilers, and ships; make brakes; strengthen cement; and fireproof many items, such as drywall. People who worked around asbestos during that time are at risk for asbestos-related lung diseases. People at highest risk include: Unprotected workers who made, installed, or removed products containing asbestos. People who worked near others who did these jobs also are at risk. Family members of workers who were exposed to asbestos. Family members may have breathed in asbestos fibers that workers brought home on their clothes, shoes, or bodies. People who live in areas with large deposits of asbestos in the soil. This risk is limited to areas where the deposits were disturbed and asbestos fibers got into the air. Asbestos fibers also can be released into the air when older buildings containing asbestos-made products are destroyed. Removing these products during building renovations also can release asbestos fibers into the air. Generally, being around asbestos-made products isnt a danger as long as the asbestos is enclosed. This prevents the fibers from getting into the air. People in the United States are less likely to have asbestos-related lung diseases now because the mineral is no longer widely used. The use of asbestos is heavily restricted, and rules and standards are now in place to protect workers and others from asbestos exposure. Asbestos is found in only a few new products, such as gaskets used in brakes. However, many countries do not yet restrict asbestos use. People in those countries are still exposed to the mineral. Outlook The outlook for people who have asbestos-related lung diseases can vary. It will depend on which disease a person has and how much it has damaged the lungs. No treatments can reverse the effects of asbestos on your lungs. However, treatments may help relieve symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and prevent complications. If you've been exposed to asbestos, let your doctor know. He or she can watch you for signs of asbestos-related problems and start treatment early, if needed. Early treatment may help prevent or delay complications. Quitting smoking and making other lifestyle changes may help people who are at high risk for asbestos-related lung diseases. These lifestyle changes may prevent more serious diseases, such as cancer."},{"prompt":"What causes AsbestosRelated Lung Diseases ?","completion":"Significant exposure to asbestos fibers causes asbestos-related lung diseases. \\"Significant\\" usually means you were exposed for at least several months to visible dust from the fibers. Asbestos fibers are very small. When you breathe in, they can get stuck deep in your lungs. The fibers remain in your lung tissue for a long time and may cause scarring and inflammation. This can lead to pleural plaque and widespread pleural thickening, pleural effusion, asbestosis, lung cancer, or mesothelioma. Generally, asbestos-related lung diseases develop 10 to 40 or more years after a person has been exposed to asbestos. Being around products that contain asbestos isn't a danger, as long as the asbestos is enclosed. This prevents the fibers from getting into the air."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for AsbestosRelated Lung Diseases? ?","completion":"Until the late 1970s, asbestos was widely used in many industries in the United States. During that time, workplace rules to ensure workers' safety around asbestos weren't required by law. Asbestos was used in or with many products. Examples include steam pipes, boilers, furnaces, and furnace ducts; wallboard; floor and ceiling tiles; wood-burning stoves and gas fireplaces; car brakes, clutches, and gaskets; railroad engines; roofing and shingles; and wall-patching materials and paints. Asbestos also was used in many other products, such as fireproof gloves, ironing board covers, cooking pot handles, and hairdryers. Anyone employed for a prolonged period in mining, milling, making, or installing asbestos products before the late 1970s is at risk for asbestos-related lung diseases. Some examples of these workers include: Miners Aircraft and auto mechanics Building construction workers Electricians Shipyard workers Boiler operators Building engineers Railroad workers In general, the risk is greatest for people who worked with asbestos and were exposed for at least several months to visible dust from asbestos fibers. The risk for asbestos-related lung diseases also depends on: How much asbestos you were exposed to. How long you were exposed to asbestos, and how often during that time you were in direct contact with it. The size, shape, and chemical makeup of the asbestos fibers. Different types of asbestos fibers can affect the lungs differently. For example, chrysotile asbestos (a curly fiber) is less likely to cause mesothelioma than amphibole asbestos (a straight fiber). Your personal risks, such as smoking or having an existing lung disease. Family members of people exposed to asbestos on the job also may be at risk. Family members may have breathed in asbestos fibers that were brought home on workers clothes, shoes, and bodies. People who live in areas that have large deposits of asbestos in the soil also are at risk for asbestos-related lung diseases.

These conditions may occur earlier than other asbestos-related lung diseases. The main symptom of asbestosis is shortness of breath with physical exertion. You also may have a dry cough and feel tired. If your doctor listens to your lungs with a stethoscope, he or she may hear a crackling sound when you breathe in. The symptoms of lung cancer may include a worsening cough or a cough that won't go away, trouble breathing, ongoing chest pain, and coughing up blood. Other symptoms of lung cancer include frequent lung infections, fatigue (tiredness), and weight loss without a known cause. Symptoms of mesothelioma include shortness of breath and chest pain due to pleural effusion."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose AsbestosRelated Lung Diseases ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose an asbestos-related lung disease based on your past exposure to asbestos, your symptoms, a physical exam, and test results. Specialists Involved Your primary care doctor, such as a family doctor or internist, may provide ongoing care if you have an asbestos-related lung disease. Other specialists also may be involved in your care, including a: Pulmonologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating lung diseases. Radiologist. This is a doctor who is specially trained to supervise x-ray tests and look at x-ray pictures. Surgeon or oncologist. An oncologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating cancer. The surgeon or oncologist may take a tissue sample from your lungs to study under a microscope. Pathologist. A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in identifying diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope. A pathologist may study your tissue sample. Exposure to Asbestos Your doctor will want to know about your history of asbestos exposure. He or she may ask about your work history and your spouse's or other family members work histories. Your doctor also may ask about your location and surroundings. For example, he or she may ask about areas of the country where you've lived. If you know you were exposed to asbestos, your doctor may ask questions to find out: How much asbestos you were exposed to. For example, were you surrounded by visible asbestos dust? How long you were exposed to asbestos and how often during that time you were in direct contact with it. Symptoms Your doctor may ask whether you have any symptoms, such as shortness of breath or coughing. The symptoms of asbestos-related lung diseases vary. They depend on which disease you have and how much it has damaged your lungs. Your doctor also may ask whether you smoke. Smoking, along with asbestos exposure, raises your risk for lung cancer. Physical Exam Your doctor will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope to find out whether your lungs are making any strange sounds. If you have a pleural effusion with a lot of fluid buildup, your doctor might hear a dull sound when he or she taps on your chest. Or, he or she might have trouble hearing any breathing sounds. If you have asbestosis, your doctor may hear a crackling sound when you breathe in. Your doctor will check your legs for swelling, which may be a sign of lung-related problems. He or she also will check your fingers and toes for clubbing. Clubbing is the widening and rounding of the fingertips and toes. Clubbing most often is linked to heart and lung diseases that cause lower-than-normal blood oxygen levels. Chest X Ray A chest x ray is the most common test for detecting asbestos-related lung diseases. This painless test creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as the lungs. A chest x ray cant detect asbestos fibers in the lungs. However, it can show asbestos-related diseases, such as pleural plaque and pleural effusion. Pleural effusion also can be a sign of a more severe disease, such as mesothelioma. A chest x ray also can show asbestosis. Often the lung tissue will appear very white on the x-ray pictures. The size, shape, location, and degree of whiteness can help your doctor figure out how much lung damage you have. Severe asbestosis may affect the whole lung and have a honeycomb look on the x-ray pictures. If you have lung cancer, a chest x ray may show masses or abnormal fluid. If you have mesothelioma, a chest x ray will show thickening of the pleura. The pleura is the tissue around the lungs and diaphragm (the muscle below your lungs). The chest xray also will usually show signs of pleural effusion in people who have mesothelioma. Other Diagnostic Tests To help confirm a chest x-ray finding, or to find out how much lung damage you have, you may have more tests. Chest Computed Tomography Scan A chest computed tomography (to-MOG-ra-fee) scan, or chest CT scan, is a painless test that creates precise pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your lungs. A CT scan is a type of x ray, but its pictures show more detail than standard chest x-ray pictures. A chest CT scan may be very helpful for finding asbestosis in its earliest stages, before a standard chest x ray can detect it. Lung Function Tests Lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can show whether your lung function is impaired. They also can help your doctor track your disease over time. Biopsy The only way to confirm a diagnosis of lung cancer or mesothelioma is for a pathologist to check samples of your lung cells or tissues. A pathologist is a doctor who identifies diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope. Doctors have many ways to collect tissue samples. One way is through bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee). For this procedure, your doctor will pass a thin, flexible tube through your nose (or sometimes your mouth), down your throat, and into your airways. He or she will then take a sample of tissue from your lungs. If your doctor thinks you have mesothelioma, you may have a thoracoscopy (thor-ah-KOS-ko-pee). For this procedure, you'll be given medicine so you don't feel any pain. Your doctor will make a small cut through your chest wall. He or she will put a thin tube with a light on it into your chest between two ribs.

Treatments for Pleural Plaque, Pleural Effusion, and Asbestosis If you have pleural plaque, pleural effusion, or asbestosis and you smoke, your doctor will advise you to quit smoking. People who have these conditions can lower their risk for lung cancer if they quit smoking. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes Your Guide to a Healthy Heart. Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. If you have trouble breathing or shortness of breath and a very low blood oxygen level, your doctor may recommend oxygen therapy. For this treatment, you're given oxygen through nasal prongs or a mask. Oxygen therapy may be done at home or in a hospital or other health facility. If excess fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion) is making it hard for you to breathe, thoracentesis (THOR-ah-sen-TE-sis) may help. For this procedure, your doctor will insert a thin needle or plastic tube into the space between your lungs and chest wall. He or she will then draw out the excess fluid. Treatments for Lung Cancer and Mesothelioma If you have lung cancer or mesothelioma, your treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or targeted therapy. (Targeted therapy uses medicines or other substances to find and attack specific lung cancer cells without harming normal cells.) Your doctor may prescribe medicines to prevent fluid buildup, ease pain, or relieve other complications of your disease. If you have lung cancer or mesothelioma, talk with your doctor about whether you should get flu and pneumonia vaccines. These vaccines can help lower your risk for lung infections."},{"prompt":"w to prevent AsbestosRelated Lung Diseases ?","completion":"You can prevent asbestos-related lung diseases by limiting your exposure to asbestos fibers. If your job requires you to work around asbestos, make sure to follow workplace rules for handling it. For example, make sure that air levels are measured, and wear a proper respirator to avoid breathing in asbestos fibers. If you live in a house or work in a building that has pipes or other products containing asbestos, you generally dont need to take special precautions. Being around products that contain asbestos isnt a danger, as long as the asbestos is enclosed. This prevents the fibers from getting into the air. If you smoke, quit. Smoking greatly increases your risk of lung cancer if you have pleural plaque, pleural effusion, or asbestosis. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking.

Rh factor is a protein on red blood cells. If you have Rh factor, you're Rh-positive. If you don't have it, you're Rh-negative. Rh factor is inherited (passed from parents to children through the genes). Most people are Rh-positive. Whether you have Rh factor doesn't affect your general health. However, it can cause problems during pregnancy. Overview When you're pregnant, blood from your baby can cross into your bloodstream, especially during delivery. If you're Rh-negative and your baby is Rh-positive, your body will react to the baby's blood as a foreign substance. Your body will create antibodies (proteins) against the baby's Rh-positive blood. These antibodies usually don't cause problems during a first pregnancy. This is because the baby often is born before many of the antibodies develop. However, the antibodies stay in your body once they have formed. Thus, Rh incompatibility is more likely to cause problems in second or later pregnancies (if the baby is Rh-positive). The Rh antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells. This can lead to hemolytic anemia (HEE-moh-lit-ick uh-NEE-me-uh) in the baby. Hemolytic anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. Red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of the body. Without enough red blood cells, your baby won't get enough oxygen. This can lead to serious problems. Severe hemolytic anemia may even be fatal to the child. Outlook With prompt and proper prenatal care and screening, you can prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility. Screening tests allow your doctor to find out early in your pregnancy whether you're at risk for the condition. If you're at risk, your doctor will carefully check on you and your baby throughout your pregnancy and prescribe treatment as needed. Injections of a medicine called Rh immune globulin can keep your body from making Rhantibodies. This medicine helps prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility. If you're Rh-negative, you'll need this medicine every time you have a baby with Rh-positive blood. Other events also can expose you to Rh-positive blood, which could affect a pregnancy. Examples include a miscarriage or blood transfusion. If you're treated with Rh immune globulin right after these events, you may be able to avoid Rh incompatibility during your next pregnancy."},{"prompt":"What causes Rh Incompatibility ?","completion":"A difference in blood type between a pregnant woman and her baby causes Rh incompatibility.

Rh factor is inherited (passed from parents to children through the genes). If you're Rh-negative and the father of your baby is Rh-positive, the baby has a 50 percent or more chance of having Rh-positive blood. Simple blood tests can show whether you and the father of your baby are Rh-positive or Rh-negative. If you're Rh-negative, your risk of problems from Rh incompatibility is higher if you were exposed to Rh-positive blood before the pregnancy. This may have happened during: An earlier pregnancy (usually during delivery). You also may have been exposed to Rh-positive blood if you had bleeding or abdominal trauma (for example, from a car accident) during the pregnancy. An ectopic pregnancy, a miscarriage, or an induced abortion. (An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that starts outside of the uterus, or womb.) A mismatched blood transfusion or blood and marrow stem cell transplant. An injection or puncture with a needle or other object containing Rh-positive blood. Certain tests also can expose you to Rh-positive blood. Examples include amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS). Amniocentesis is a test that you may have during pregnancy. Your doctor uses a needle to remove a small amount of fluid from the sac around your baby. The fluid is then tested for various reasons. CVS also may be done during pregnancy. For this test, your doctor threads a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta. He or she removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The tissue sample is tested for various reasons. Unless you were treated with the medicine that prevents Rh antibodies (Rh immune globulin) after each of these events, you're at risk for Rh incompatibility during current and future pregnancies."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Rh Incompatibility ?","completion":"Rh incompatibility doesn't cause signs or symptoms in a pregnant woman. In a baby, the condition can lead to hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin), an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen to the body. Without enough red blood cells and hemoglobin, the baby won't get enough oxygen. Hemolytic anemia can cause mild to severe signs and symptoms in a newborn, such as jaundice and a buildup of fluid. Jaundice is a yellowish color of the skin and whites of the eyes. When red blood cells die, they release hemoglobin into the blood. The hemoglobin is broken down into a compound called bilirubin. This compound gives the skin and eyes a yellowish color. High levels of bilirubin can lead to brain damage in the baby. The buildup of fluid is a result of heart failure. Without enough hemoglobin-carrying red blood cells, the baby's heart has to work harder to move oxygen-rich blood through the body. This stress can lead to heart failure. Heart failure can cause fluid to build up in many parts of the body. When this occurs in a fetus or newborn, the condition is called hydrops fetalis (HI-drops fe-TAL-is). Severe hemolytic anemia can be fatal to a newborn at the time of birth or shortly after."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Rh Incompatibility ?","completion":"Rh incompatibility is diagnosed with blood tests. To find out whether a baby is developing hemolytic anemia and how serious it is, doctors may use more advanced tests, such as ultrasound. Specialists Involved An obstetrician will screen for Rh incompatibility. This is a doctor who specializes in treating pregnant women. The obstetrician also will monitor the pregnancy and the baby for problems related to hemolytic anemia. He or she also will oversee treatment to prevent problems with future pregnancies. A pediatrician or hematologist treats newborns who have hemolytic anemia and related problems. A pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in treating children. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in treating people who have blood diseases and disorders. Diagnostic Tests If you're pregnant, your doctor will order a simple blood test at your first prenatal visit to learn whether you're Rh-positive or Rh-negative. If you're Rh-negative, you also may have another blood test called an antibody screen. This test shows whether you have Rh antibodies in your blood. If you do, it means that you were exposed to Rh-positive blood before and you're at risk for Rh incompatibility. If you're Rh-negative and you don't have Rh antibodies, your baby's father also will be tested to find out his Rh type. If he's Rh-negative too, the baby has no chance of having Rh-positive blood. Thus, there's no risk of Rh incompatibility. However, if the baby's father is Rh-positive, the baby has a 50 percent or more chance of having Rh-positive blood. As a result, you're at high risk of developing Rhincompatibility. If your baby's father is Rh-positive, or if it's not possible to find out his Rh status, your doctor may do a test called amniocentesis. For this test, your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus. He or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby. The fluid is tested to learn whether the baby is Rh-positive. (Rarely, an amniocentesis can expose you to Rh-positive blood). Your doctor also may use this test to measure bilirubin levels in your baby. Bilirubin builds up as a result of red blood cells dying too quickly. The higher the level of bilirubin is, the greater the chance that the baby has hemolytic anemia. If Rh incompatibility is known or suspected, you'll be tested for Rh antibodies one or more times during your pregnancy. This test often is done at least once at your sixth or seventh month of pregnancy. The results from this test also can suggest how severe the baby's hemolytic anemia has become. Higher levels of antibodies suggest more severe hemolytic anemia. To check your baby for hemolytic anemia, your doctor also may use a test called Doppler ultrasound. He or she will use this test to measure how fast blood is flowing through an artery in the baby's head. Doppler ultrasound uses sound waves to measure how fast blood is moving. The faster the blood flow is, the greater the risk of hemolytic anemia. This is because the anemia will cause the baby's heart to pump more blood."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Rh Incompatibility ?","completion":"Rh incompatibility is treated with a medicine called Rh immune globulin. Treatment for a baby who has hemolytic anemia will vary based on the severity of the condition. Goals of Treatment The goals of treating Rh incompatibility are to ensure that your baby is healthy and to lower your risk for the condition in future pregnancies. Treatment for Rh Incompatibility If Rh incompatibility is diagnosed during your pregnancy, you'll receive Rh immune globulin in your seventh month of pregnancy and again within 72 hours of delivery. You also may receive Rh immune globulin if the risk of blood transfer between you and the baby is high (for example, if you've had a miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or bleeding during pregnancy). Rh immune globulin contains Rh antibodies that attach to the Rh-positive blood cells in your blood. When this happens, your body doesn't react to the baby's Rh-positive cells as a foreign substance. As a result, your body doesn't make Rh antibodies. Rh immune globulin must be given at the correct times to work properly. Once you have formed Rh antibodies, the medicine will no longer help. That's why a woman who has Rh-negative blood must be treated with the medicine with each pregnancy or any other event that allows her blood to mix with Rh-positive blood. Rh immune globulin is injected into the muscle of your arm or buttock. Side effects may include soreness at the injection site and a slight fever. The medicine also may be injected into a vein. Treatment for Hemolytic Anemia Several options are available for treating hemolytic anemia in a baby. In mild cases, no treatment may be needed. If treatment is needed, the baby may be given a medicine called erythropoietin and iron supplements. These treatments can prompt the body to make red blood cells. If the hemolytic anemia is severe, the baby may get a blood transfusion through the umbilical cord. If the hemolytic anemia is severe and the baby is almost full-term, your doctor may induce labor early. This allows the baby's doctor to begin treatment right away. A newborn who has severe anemia may be treated with a blood exchange transfusion. The procedure involves slowly removing the newborn's blood and replacing it with fresh blood or plasma from a donor. Newborns also may be treated with special lights to reduce the amount of bilirubin in their blood. These babies may have jaundice (a yellowish color of the skin and whites of the eyes). High levels of bilirubin cause jaundice. Reducing the blood's bilirubin level is important because high levels of this compound can cause brain damage. High levels of bilirubin often are seen in babies who have hemolytic anemia. This is because the compound forms when red blood cells break down."},{"prompt":"w to prevent Rh Incompatibility ?","completion":"Rh incompatibility can be prevented with Rh immune globulin, as long as the medicine is given at the correct times. Once you have formed Rh antibodies, the medicine will no longer help. Thus, a woman who has Rh-negative blood must be treated with Rh immune globulin during and after each pregnancy or after any other event that allows her blood to mix with Rh-positive blood. Early prenatal care also can help prevent some of the problems linked to Rh incompatibility. For example, your doctor can find out early whether you're at risk for the condition. If you're at risk, your doctor can closely monitor your pregnancy.

People who have insomnia have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both. As a result, they may get too little sleep or have poor-quality sleep. They may not feel refreshed when they wake up. Overview Insomnia can be acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing). Acute insomnia is common and often is brought on by situations such as stress at work, family pressures, or a traumatic event. Acute insomnia lasts for days or weeks. Chronic insomnia lasts for a month or longer. Most cases of chronic insomnia are secondary, which means they are the symptom or side effect of some other problem. Certain medical conditions, medicines, sleep disorders, and substances can cause secondary insomnia. In contrast, primary insomnia isn't due to medical problems, medicines, or other substances. It is its own distinct disorder, and its cause isnt well understood. Many life changes can trigger primary insomnia, including long-lasting stress and emotional upset. Insomnia can cause daytime sleepiness and a lack of energy. It also can make you feel anxious, depressed, or irritable. You may have trouble focusing on tasks, paying attention, learning, and remembering. These problems can prevent you from doing your best at work or school. Insomnia also can cause other serious problems. For example, you may feel drowsy while driving, which could lead to an accident. Outlook Treating the underlying cause of secondary insomnia may resolve or improve the sleep problem, especially if you can correct the problem soon after it starts. For example, if caffeine is causing your insomnia, stopping or limiting your intake of the substance might make the insomnia go away. Lifestyle changes, including better sleep habits, often help relieve acute insomnia. For chronic insomnia, your doctor may recommend medicines or cognitive-behavioral therapy."},{"prompt":"What causes Insomnia ?","completion":"Secondary Insomnia Secondary insomnia is the symptom or side effect of another problem. This type of insomnia often is a symptom of an emotional, neurological, or other medical or sleep disorder. Emotional disorders that can cause insomnia include depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are examples of neurological disorders that can cause insomnia. Many other disorders or factors also can cause insomnia, such as: Conditions that cause chronic (ongoing) pain, such as arthritis and headache disorders Conditions that make it hard to breathe, such as asthma and heart failure An overactive thyroid Gastrointestinal disorders, such as heartburn Stroke Sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep-related breathing problems Menopause and hot flashes Secondary insomnia also can be a side effect of some medicines. For example, certain asthma medicines, such as theophylline, and some allergy and cold medicines can cause insomnia. Beta blockers also can cause the condition. These medicines are used to treat heart conditions. Commonly used substances also can cause insomnia. Examples include caffeine and other stimulants, tobacco and other nicotine products, and alcohol and other sedatives. Primary Insomnia Primary insomnia isn't a symptom or side effect of another medical condition. It is its own distinct disorder, and its cause isnt well understood. Primary insomnia usually lasts for at least 1 month. Many life changes can trigger primary insomnia. It may be due to major or long-lasting stress or emotional upset. Travel or other factors, such as work schedules that disrupt your sleep routine, also may trigger primary insomnia. Even if these issues are resolved, the insomnia may not go away. Trouble sleeping can persist because of habits formed to deal with the lack of sleep. These habits might include taking naps, worrying about sleep, and going to bed early. Researchers continue to try to find out whether some people are born with an increased risk for primary insomnia."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Insomnia? ?","completion":"Insomnia is a common disorder. It affects women more often than men. The disorder can occur at any age. However, older adults are more likely to have insomnia than younger people.

You may wake up feeling tired or not well-rested, and you may feel tired during the day. You also may have trouble focusing on tasks. Insomnia can cause you to feel anxious, depressed, or irritable. Insomnia also can affect your daily activities and cause serious problems. For example, you may feel drowsy while driving. Driver sleepiness (not related to alcohol) is responsible for almost 20 percent of all serious car crash injuries. Research also shows that insomnia raises older womens risk of falling.

He or she also may recommend a sleep study. For example, you may have a sleep study if the cause of your insomnia is unclear. Medical History To find out what's causing your insomnia, your doctor may ask whether you: Have any new or ongoing health problems Have painful injuries or health conditions, such as arthritis Take any medicines, either over-the-counter or prescription Have symptoms or a history of depression, anxiety, or psychosis Are coping with highly stressful life events, such as divorce or death Your doctor also may ask questions about your work and leisure habits. For example, he or she may ask about your work and exercise routines; your use of caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol; and your long-distance travel history. Your answers can give clues about what's causing your insomnia. Your doctor also may ask whether you have any new or ongoing work or personal problems or other stresses in your life. Also, he or she may ask whether you have other family members who have sleep problems. Sleep History To get a better sense of your sleep problem, your doctor will ask you for details about your sleep habits. Before your visit, think about how to describe your problems, including: How often you have trouble sleeping and how long you've had the problem When you go to bed and get up on workdays and days off How long it takes you to fall asleep, how often you wake up at night, and how long it takes to fall back asleep Whether you snore loudly and often or wake up gasping or feeling out of breath How refreshed you feel when you wake up, and how tired you feel during the day How often you doze off or have trouble staying awake during routine tasks, especially driving To find out what's causing or worsening your insomnia, your doctor also may ask you: Whether you worry about falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting enough sleep What you eat or drink, and whether you take medicines before going to bed What routine you follow before going to bed What the noise level, lighting, and temperature are like where you sleep What distractions, such as a TV or computer, are in your bedroom To help your doctor, consider keeping a sleep diary for 1 or 2 weeks. Write down when you go to sleep, wake up, and take naps. (For example, you might note: Went to bed at 10 a.m.; woke up at 3 a.m. and couldn't fall back asleep; napped after work for 2 hours.) Also write down how much you sleep each night, as well as how sleepy you feel throughout the day. You can find a sample sleep diary in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \\"Your Guide to Healthy Sleep.\\" Physical Exam Your doctor will do a physical exam to rule out other medical problems that might cause insomnia. You also may need blood tests to check for thyroid problems or other conditions that can cause sleep problems. Sleep Study Your doctor may recommend a sleep study called a polysomnogram (PSG) if he or she thinks an underlying sleep disorder is causing your insomnia. Youll likely stay overnight at a sleep center for this study. The PSG records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure. A PSG also records the amount of oxygen in your blood, how much air is moving through your nose while you breathe, snoring, and chest movements. The chest movements show whether you're making an effort to breathe."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Insomnia ?","completion":"Lifestyle changes often can help relieve acute (short-term) insomnia. These changes might make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. A type of counseling called cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help relieve the anxiety linked to chronic (ongoing) insomnia. Anxiety tends to prolong insomnia. Several medicines also can help relieve insomnia and re-establish a regular sleep schedule. However, if your insomnia is the symptom or side effect of another problem, it's important to treat the underlying cause (if possible). Lifestyle Changes If you have insomnia, avoid substances that make it worse, such as: Caffeine, tobacco, and other stimulants. The effects of these substances can last as long as 8 hours. Certain over-the-counter and prescription medicines that can disrupt sleep (for example, some cold and allergy medicines). Talk with your doctor about which medicines won't disrupt your sleep. Alcohol. An alcoholic drink before bedtime might make it easier for you to fall asleep. However, alcohol triggers sleep that tends to be lighter than normal. This makes it more likely that you will wake up during the night. Try to adopt bedtime habits that make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. Follow a routine that helps you wind down and relax before bed. For example, read a book, listen to soothing music, or take a hot bath. Try to schedule your daily exercise at least 5 to 6 hours before going to bed. Don't eat heavy meals or drink a lot before bedtime. Make your bedroom sleep-friendly. Avoid bright lighting while winding down. Try to limit possible distractions, such as a TV, computer, or pet. Make sure the temperature of your bedroom is cool and comfortable. Your bedroom also should be dark and quiet. Go to sleep around the same time each night and wake up around the same time each morning, even on weekends. If you can, avoid night shifts, alternating schedules, or other things that may disrupt your sleep schedule. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy CBT for insomnia targets the thoughts and actions that can disrupt sleep. This therapy encourages good sleep habits and uses several methods to relieve sleep anxiety. For example, relaxation techniques and biofeedback are used to reduce anxiety. These strategies help you better control your breathing, heart rate, muscles, and mood. CBT also aims to replace sleep anxiety with more positive thinking that links being in bed with being asleep. This method also teaches you what to do if you're unable to fall asleep within a reasonable time. CBT also may involve talking with a therapist one-on-one or in group sessions to help you consider your thoughts and feelings about sleep. This method may encourage you to describe thoughts racing through your mind in terms of how they look, feel, and sound. The goal is for your mind to settle down and stop racing. CBT also focuses on limiting the time you spend in bed while awake. This method involves setting a sleep schedule. At first, you will limit your total time in bed to the typical short length of time you're usually asleep. This schedule might make you even more tired because some of the allotted time in bed will be taken up by problems falling asleep. However, the resulting tiredness is intended to help you get to sleep more quickly. Over time, the length of time spent in bed is increased until you get a full night of sleep. For success with CBT, you may need to see a therapist who is skilled in this approach weekly over 2 to 3 months. CBT works as well as prescription medicine for many people who have chronic insomnia. It also may provide better long-term relief than medicine alone. For people who have insomnia and major depressive disorder, CBT combined with antidepression medicines has shown promise in relieving both conditions. Medicines Prescription Medicines Many prescription medicines are used to treat insomnia. Some are meant for short-term use, while others are meant for longer use. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and side effects of insomnia medicines. For example, insomnia medicines can help you fall asleep, but you may feel groggy in the morning after taking them. Rare side effects of these medicines include sleep eating, sleep walking, or driving while asleep. If you have side effects from an insomnia medicine, or if it doesn't work well, tell your doctor. He or she might prescribe a different medicine. Some insomnia medicines can be habit forming. Ask your doctor about the benefits and risks of insomnia medicines. Over-the-Counter Products Some over-the-counter (OTC) products claim to treat insomnia. These products include melatonin, L-tryptophan supplements, and valerian teas or extracts. The Food and Drug Administration doesn't regulate natural products and some food supplements. Thus, the dose and purity of these substances can vary. How well these products work and how safe they are isn't well understood. Some OTC products that contain antihistamines are sold as sleep aids. Although these products might make you sleepy, talk to your doctor before taking them. Antihistamines pose risks for some people. Also, these products may not offer the best treatment for your insomnia. Your doctor can advise you whether these products will benefit you."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation ?","completion":"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (ko-ag-u-LA-shun), or DIC, is a condition in which blood clots form throughout the body's small blood vessels. These blood clots can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels, which can damage the body's organs. In DIC, the increased clotting uses up platelets (PLATE-lets) and clotting factors in the blood. Platelets are blood cell fragments that stick together to seal small cuts and breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins needed for normal blood clotting. With fewer platelets and clotting factors in the blood, serious bleeding can occur. DIC can cause internal and external bleeding. Internal bleeding occurs inside the body. External bleeding occurs underneath or from the skin or mucosa. (The mucosa is the tissue that lines some organs and body cavities, such as your nose and mouth.) DIC can cause life-threatening bleeding. Overview To understand DIC, it helps to understand the body's normal blood clotting process. Your body has a system to control bleeding. When small cuts or breaks occur on blood vessel walls, your body activates clotting factors. These clotting factors, such as thrombin and fibrin, work with platelets to form blood clots. Blood clots seal the small cuts or breaks on the blood vessel walls. After bleeding stops and the vessels heal, your body breaks down and removes the clots. Some diseases and conditions can cause clotting factors to become overactive, leading to DIC. These diseases and conditions include: Sepsis (an infection in the bloodstream) Surgery and trauma Cancer Serious complications of pregnancy and childbirth Examples of less common causes of DIC are bites from poisonous snakes (such as rattlesnakes and other vipers), frostbite, and burns. The two types of DIC are acute and chronic. Acute DIC develops quickly (over hours or days) and must be treated right away. The condition begins with excessive blood clotting in the small blood vessels and quickly leads to serious bleeding. Chronic DIC develops slowly (over weeks or months). It lasts longer and usually isn't recognized as quickly as acute DIC. Chronic DIC causes excessive blood clotting, but it usually doesn't lead to bleeding. Cancer is the most common cause of chronic DIC. Treatment for DIC involves treating the clotting and bleeding problems and the underlying cause of the condition. People who have acute DIC may need blood transfusions, medicines, and other life-saving measures. People who have chronic DIC may need medicines to help prevent blood clots from forming in their small blood vessels. Outlook The outlook for DIC depends on its severity and underlying cause. Acute DIC can damage the body's organs and even cause death if it's not treated right away. Chronic DIC also can damage the body's organs. Researchers are looking for ways to prevent DIC or diagnose it early. They're also studying the use of various clotting proteins and medicines to treat the condition."},{"prompt":"What causes Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation ?","completion":"Some diseases and conditions can disrupt the body's normal blood clotting process and lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Acute DIC develops quickly (over hours or days) and is very serious. Chronic DIC develops more slowly (over weeks or months). It lasts longer and usually isn't recognized as quickly as acute DIC. With acute DIC, blood clotting in the blood vessels usually occurs first, followed by bleeding. However, bleeding may be the first obvious sign. Serious bleeding can occur very quickly after developing acute DIC. Thus, emergency treatment in a hospital is needed. Blood clotting also occurs with chronic DIC, but it usually doesn't lead to bleeding. Sometimes chronic DIC has no signs or symptoms. Signs and Symptoms of Excessive Blood Clotting In DIC, blood clots form throughout the body's small blood vessels. These blood clots can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels. This can cause the following signs and symptoms: Chest pain and shortness of breath if blood clots form in the blood vessels in your lungs and heart. Pain, redness, warmth, and swelling in the lower leg if blood clots form in the deep veins of your leg. Headaches, speech changes, paralysis (an inability to move), dizziness, and trouble speaking and understanding if blood clots form in the blood vessels in your brain. These signs and symptoms may indicate a stroke. Heart attack and lung and kidney problems if blood clots lodge in your heart, lungs, or kidneys. These organs may even begin to fail. Signs and Symptoms of Bleeding In DIC, the increased clotting activity uses up the platelets and clotting factors in the blood. As a result, serious bleeding can occur. DIC can cause internal and external bleeding. Internal Bleeding Internal bleeding can occur in your body's organs, such as the kidneys, intestines, and brain. This bleeding can be life threatening. Signs and symptoms of internal bleeding include: Blood in your urine from bleeding in your kidneys or bladder. Blood in your stools from bleeding in your intestines or stomach. Blood in your stools can appear red or as a dark, tarry color. (Taking iron supplements also can cause dark, tarry stools.) Headaches, double vision, seizures, and other symptoms from bleeding in your brain. External Bleeding External bleeding can occur underneath or from the skin, such as at the site of cuts or an intravenous (IV) needle. External bleeding also can occur from the mucosa. (The mucosa is the tissue that lines some organs and body cavities, such as your nose and mouth.) External bleeding may cause purpura (PURR-purr-ah) or petechiae (peh-TEE-key-ay). Purpura are purple, brown, and red bruises. This bruising may happen easily and often. Petechiae are small red or purple dots on your skin. Purpura and Petechiae Other signs of external bleeding include: Prolonged bleeding, even from minor cuts. Bleeding or oozing from your gums or nose, especially nosebleeds or bleeding from brushing your teeth. Heavy or extended menstrual bleeding in women."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor also will look for the cause of DIC. Acute DIC requires emergency treatment. The condition can be life threatening if it's not treated right away. If you have signs or symptoms of severe bleeding or blood clots, call 911 right away. Medical History and Physical Exam Your doctor will ask whether you have or have had any diseases or conditions that can trigger DIC. For more information about these diseases and conditions, go to \\"What Causes Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation?\\" Your doctor will ask about signs and symptoms of blood clots and bleeding. He or she also will do a physical exam to look for signs and symptoms of blood clots and internal and external bleeding. For example, your doctor may look for bleeding from your gums. Diagnostic Tests To diagnose DIC, your doctor may recommend blood tests to look at your blood cells and the clotting process. For these tests, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm. Complete Blood Count and Blood Smear A complete blood count (CBC) measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Platelets are blood cell fragments that help with blood clotting. Abnormal platelet numbers may be a sign of a bleeding disorder (not enough clotting) or a thrombotic disorder (too much clotting). A blood smear is a test that may reveal whether your red blood cells are damaged. Tests for Clotting Factors and Clotting Time The following tests examine the proteins active in the blood clotting process and how long it takes them to form a blood clot. PT and PTT tests. These tests measure how long it takes blood clots to form. Serum fibrinogen. Fibrinogen is a protein that helps the blood clot. This test measures how much fibrinogen is in your blood. Fibrin degradation. After blood clots dissolve, substances called fibrin degradation products are left behind in the blood. This test measures the amount of these substances in the blood."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation ?","completion":"Treatment for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) depends on its severity and cause. The main goals of treating DIC are to control bleeding and clotting problems and treat the underlying cause. Acute Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation People who have acute DIC may have severe bleeding that requires emergency treatment in a hospital. Treatment may include blood transfusions, medicines, and oxygen therapy. (Oxygen is given through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube.) A blood transfusion is a safe, common procedure. You receive blood through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels. Blood transfusions are done to replace blood loss due to an injury, surgery, or illness. Blood is made up of various parts, including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma. Some blood transfusions involve whole blood (blood with all of its parts). More often though, only some parts of blood are transfused. If you have DIC, you may be given platelets and clotting factors, red blood cells, and plasma (the liquid part of blood). Chronic Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation People who have chronic DIC are more likely to have blood clotting problems than bleeding. If you have chronic DIC, your doctor may treat you with medicines called anticoagulants, or blood thinners. Blood thinners help prevent blood clots from forming. They also keep existing blood clots from getting larger."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Coronary Heart Disease ?","completion":"Espaol Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a disease in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle. When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis. The buildup of plaque occurs over many years. Atherosclerosis Over time, plaque can harden or rupture (break open). Hardened plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart. If the plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form on its surface. A large blood clot can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery. Over time, ruptured plaque also hardens and narrows the coronary arteries. Overview If the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, angina or a heart attack can occur. Angina is chest pain or discomfort. It may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. The pain also can occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion. A heart attack occurs if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle is cut off. If blood flow isnt restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. Without quick treatment, a heart attack can lead to serious health problems or death. Over time, CHD can weaken the heart muscle and lead to heart failure and arrhythmias. Heart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your bodys needs. Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. Outlook Lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures can help prevent or treat coronary heart disease. These treatments may reduce the risk of related health problems."},{"prompt":"What causes Coronary Heart Disease ?","completion":"Research suggests that coronary heart disease (CHD) starts when certain factors damage the inner layers of the coronary arteries. These factors include: Smoking High levels of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood High blood pressure High levels of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes Blood vessel inflammation Plaque might begin to build up where the arteries are damaged. The buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries may start in childhood. Over time, plaque can harden or rupture (break open). Hardened plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart. This can cause angina (chest pain or discomfort). If the plaque ruptures, blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) stick to the site of the injury. They may clump together to form blood clots. Blood clots can further narrow the coronary arteries and worsen angina. If a clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block a coronary artery and cause a heart attack."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Coronary Heart Disease? ?","completion":"In the United States, coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death for both men and women. Each year, about 370,000 Americans die from coronary heart disease. Certain traits, conditions, or habits may raise your risk for CHD. The more risk factors you have, the more likely you are to develop the disease. You can control many risk factors, which may help prevent or delay CHD. Major Risk Factors Unhealthy blood cholesterol levels. This includes high LDL cholesterol (sometimes called bad cholesterol) and low HDL cholesterol (sometimes called good cholesterol). High blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.) Smoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels, lead to unhealthy cholesterol levels, and raise blood pressure. Smoking also can limit how much oxygen reaches the body's tissues. Insulin resistance. This condition occurs if the body can't use its own insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where it's used for energy. Insulin resistance may lead to diabetes. Diabetes. With this disease, the body's blood sugar level is too high because the body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use its insulin properly. Overweight or obesity. The terms overweight and obesity refer to body weight thats greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height. Metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raises your risk for CHD and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke. Lack of physical activity. Being physically inactive can worsen other risk factors for CHD, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, and overweight or obesity. Unhealthy diet. An unhealthy diet can raise your risk for CHD. Foods that are high in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, and sugar can worsen other risk factors for CHD. Older age. Genetic or lifestyle factors cause plaque to build up in your arteries as you age. In men, the risk for coronary heart disease increases starting at age 45. In women, the risk for coronary heart disease increases starting at age 55. A family history of early coronary heart disease is a risk factor for developing coronary heart disease, specifically if a father or brother is diagnosed before age 55, or a mother or sister is diagnosed before age 65. Although older age and a family history of early heart disease are risk factors, it doesn't mean that youll develop CHD if you have one or both. Controlling other risk factors often can lessen genetic influences and help prevent CHD, even in older adults. Emerging Risk Factors Researchers continue to study other possible risk factors for CHD. High levels of a protein called C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood may raise the risk of CHD and heart attack. High levels of CRP are a sign of inflammation in the body. Inflammation is the body's response to injury or infection. Damage to the arteries' inner walls may trigger inflammation and help plaque grow. Research is under way to find out whether reducing inflammation and lowering CRP levels also can reduce the risk of CHD and heart attack. High levels of triglycerides in the blood also may raise the risk of CHD, especially in women. Triglycerides are a type of fat. Other Risks Related to Coronary Heart Disease Other conditions and factors also may contribute to CHD, including: Sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Untreated sleep apnea can increase your risk for high blood pressure, diabetes, and even a heart attack or stroke. Stress. Research shows that the most commonly reported \\"trigger\\" for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting event, especially one involving anger. Alcohol. Heavy drinking can damage the heart muscle and worsen other CHD risk factors. Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. Preeclampsia. This condition can occur during pregnancy. The two main signs of preeclampsia are a rise in blood pressure and excess protein in the urine. Preeclampsia is linked to an increased lifetime risk of heart disease, including CHD, heart attack, heart failure, and high blood pressure.

Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs if an area of your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. Angina may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. You also may feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion. The pain tends to get worse with activity and go away with rest. Emotional stress also can trigger the pain. Another common symptom of CHD is shortness of breath. This symptom occurs if CHD causes heart failure. When you have heart failure, your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your bodys needs. Fluid builds up in your lungs, making it hard to breathe. The severity of these symptoms varies. They may get more severe as the buildup of plaque continues to narrow the coronary arteries. Signs and Symptoms of Heart Problems Related to Coronary Heart Disease Some people who have CHD have no signs or symptomsa condition called silent CHD. The disease might not be diagnosed until a person has signs or symptoms of a heart attack, heart failure, or an arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat). Heart Attack A heart attack occurs if the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a section of heart muscle is cut off. This can happen if an area of plaque in a coronary artery ruptures (breaks open). Blood cell fragments called platelets stick to the site of the injury and may clump together to form blood clots. If a clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery. If the blockage isnt treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems. Heart With Muscle Damage and a Blocked Artery The most common heart attack symptom is chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest that often lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. The discomfort can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. The feeling can be mild or severe. Heart attack pain sometimes feels like indigestion or heartburn. The symptoms of angina can be similar to the symptoms of a heart attack. Angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest. Chest pain or discomfort that doesnt go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while youre resting) might be a sign of a heart attack. If you dont know whether your chest pain is angina or a heart attack, call 911. All chest pain should be checked by a doctor. Other common signs and symptoms of a heart attack include: Upper body discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach Shortness of breath, which may occur with or before chest discomfort Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), vomiting, light-headedness or fainting, or breaking out in a cold sweat Sleep problems, fatigue (tiredness), or lack of energy For more information, go to the Health Topics Heart Attack article. Heart Failure Heart failure is a condition in which your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your bodys needs. Heart failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop working. The most common signs and symptoms of heart failure are shortness of breath or trouble breathing; fatigue; and swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, stomach, and veins in the neck. All of these symptoms are the result of fluid buildup in your body. When symptoms start, you may feel tired and short of breath after routine physical effort, like climbing stairs. For more information, go to the Health Topics Heart Failure article. Arrhythmia An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. When you have an arrhythmia, you may notice that your heart is skipping beats or beating too fast. Some people describe arrhythmias as a fluttering feeling in the chest. These feelings are called palpitations (pal-pih-TA-shuns). Some arrhythmias can cause your heart to suddenly stop beating. This condition is called sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). SCA usually causes death if it's not treated within minutes. For more information, go to the Health Topics Arrhythmia article."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Coronary Heart Disease ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose coronary heart disease (CHD) based on your medical and family histories, your risk factors for CHD, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures. No single test can diagnose CHD. If your doctor thinks you have CHD, he or she may recommend one or more of the following tests. EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart. An EKG can show signs of heart damage due to CHD and signs of a previous or current heart attack. Stress Testing During stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate. When your heart is working hard and beating fast, it needs more blood and oxygen. Plaque-narrowed arteries can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your heart's needs. A stress test can show possible signs and symptoms of CHD, such as: Abnormal changes in your heart rate or blood pressure Shortness of breath or chest pain Abnormal changes in your heart rhythm or your heart's electrical activity If you can't exercise for as long as what is considered normal for someone your age, your heart may not be getting enough oxygen-rich blood. However, other factors also can prevent you from exercising long enough (for example, lung diseases, anemia, or poor general fitness). As part of some stress tests, pictures are taken of your heart while you exercise and while you rest. These imaging stress tests can show how well blood is flowing in your heart and how well your heart pumps blood when it beats. Echocardiography Echocardiography(echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The picture shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working. Echo also can show areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow. Chest X Ray A chest x ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can reveal signs of heart failure, as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to CHD. Blood Tests Blood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in your blood. Abnormal levels might be a sign that you're at risk for CHD. Coronary Angiography and Cardiac Catheterization Your doctor may recommend coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-rah-fee) if other tests or factors show that you're likely to have CHD. This test uses dye and special x rays to show the insides of your coronary arteries. To get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun). A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream. Special x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels. Cardiac catheterization usually is done in a hospital. You're awake during the procedure. It usually causes little or no pain, although you may feel some soreness in the blood vessel where your doctor inserts the catheter."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Coronary Heart Disease ?","completion":"Treatments for coronary heart disease include heart-healthy lifestyle changes, medicines, medical procedures and surgery, and cardiac rehabilitation. Treatment goals may include: Lowering the risk of blood clots forming (blood clots can cause a heart attack) Preventing complications of coronary heart disease Reducing risk factors in an effort to slow, stop, or reverse the buildup of plaque Relieving symptoms Widening or bypassing clogged arteries Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have coronary heart disease. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include: Heart-healthy eating Maintaining a healthy weight Managing stress Physical activity Quitting smoking Heart-Healthy Eating Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include: Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as fat-free milk Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating: A lot of red meat Palm and coconut oils Sugary foods and beverages Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise: Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats andmeats. Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples: 1,200 calories a day 8 grams of saturated fat a day 1,500 calories a day 10 grams of saturated fat a day 1,800 calories a day 12 grams of saturated fat a day 2,000 calories a day 13 grams of saturated fat a day 2,500 calories a day 17 grams of saturated fat a day Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are: Avocados Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils Peanut butter Salmon and trout Tofu Sodium You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt. The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH. Alcohol Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol canraise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is: 12 ounces of beer 5 ounces of wine 1 ounces of liquor Maintaining a Healthy Weight Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active. Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI: Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight. Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range. Between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. Of 30 or more is considered obese. A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal. Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk. If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol. Managing Stress Research shows that the most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting eventparticularly one involving anger. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy. Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as: A stress management program Meditation Physical activity Relaxation therapy Talking things out with friends or family Physical Activity Routine physical activity can lower many coronary heart disease risk factors, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease. Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time spread throughout the week. Read more about physical activity at: Physical Activity and Your Heart U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines forAmericans Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. Quitting Smoking If you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Read more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart. Medicines Sometimes lifestyle changes arent enough to control your blood cholesterol levels. For example, you may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have: Coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a stroke Diabetes High LDL cholesterol levels Doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with those who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to: Decrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly. Lower your blood pressure. Prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke. Prevent or delay the need for a stent or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or surgery, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Reduce your hearts workload and relieve coronary heart disease symptoms. Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your coronary heart disease. Medical Procedures and Surgery You may need a procedure or surgery to treat coronary heart disease. Both PCIand CABG are used to treat blocked coronary arteries. You and your doctor can discuss which treatment is right for you. Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Percutaneous coronary intervention, commonly known as angioplasty, is a nonsurgical procedure that opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. A thin, flexible tube with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to compress the plaque against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery. During the procedure, the doctor may put a small mesh tube called a stent in the artery. The stent helps prevent blockages in the artery in the months or years after angioplasty. Read more about this procedure at PCI. Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting CABG is a type of surgery in which arteries or veins from other areas in your body are used to bypass (that is, go around) your narrowed coronary arteries. CABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack. Read more about this surgery at CABG. Cardiac Rehabilitation Your doctor may prescribe cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) for angina or after CABG, angioplasty, or a heart attack. Nearly everyone who has coronary heart disease can benefit from cardiac rehab. Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that may help improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems. The cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists. Rehab has two parts: Education, counseling, and training. This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to reduce your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to cope with the stress of adjusting to a new lifestyle and how to deal with your fears about the future. Exercise training. This part helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests.

The condition occurs if your immune system attacks your blood vessels by mistake. This may happen as the result of an infection, a medicine, or another disease or condition. Inflammation refers to the bodys response to injury, including injury to the blood vessels. Inflammation may involve pain, redness, warmth, swelling, and loss of function in the affected tissues. In vasculitis, inflammation can lead to serious problems. Complications depend on which blood vessels, organs, or other body systems are affected. Overview Vasculitis can affect any of the body's blood vessels. These include arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries carry blood from your heart to your body's organs. Veins carry blood from your organs and limbs back to your heart. Capillaries connect the small arteries and veins. If a blood vessel is inflamed, it can narrow or close off. This limits or prevents blood flow through the vessel. Rarely, the blood vessel will stretch and weaken, causing it to bulge. This bulge is known as an aneurysm (AN-u-rism). Vasculitis The disruption in blood flow caused by inflammation can damage the body's organs. Signs and symptoms depend on which organs have been damaged and the extent of the damage. Typical symptoms of inflammation, such as fever and general aches and pains, are common among people who have vasculitis. Outlook There are many types of vasculitis, but overall the condition is rare. If you have vasculitis, the outlook depends on: The type of vasculitis you have Which organs are affected How quickly the condition worsens The severity of the condition Treatment often works well if its started early. In some cases, vasculitis may go into remission. \\"Remission\\" means the condition isn't active, but it can come back, or \\"flare,\\" at any time. Sometimes vasculitis is chronic (ongoing) and never goes into remission. Long-term treatment with medicines often can control the signs and symptoms of chronic vasculitis. Rarely, vasculitis doesn't respond well to treatment. This can lead to disability and even death. Much is still unknown about vasculitis.

They depend on the type of vasculitis you have, the organs involved, and the severity of the condition. Some people may have few signs and symptoms. Other people may become very sick. Sometimes the signs and symptoms develop slowly, over months. Other times, the signs and symptoms develop quickly, over days or weeks. Systemic Signs and Symptoms Systemic signs and symptoms are those that affect you in a general or overall way. Common systemic signs and symptoms of vasculitis are: Fever Loss of appetite Weight loss Fatigue (tiredness) General aches and pains Organ- or Body System-Specific Signs and Symptoms Vasculitis can affect specific organs and body systems, causing a range of signs and symptoms. Skin If vasculitis affects your skin, you may notice skin changes. For example, you may have purple or red spots or bumps, clusters of small dots, splotches, bruises, or hives. Your skin also may itch. Joints If vasculitis affects your joints, you may ache or develop arthritis in one or more joints. Lungs If vasculitis affects your lungs, you may feel short of breath. You may even cough up blood. The results from a chest x ray may show signs that suggest pneumonia, even though that may not be what you have. Gastrointestinal Tract If vasculitis affects your gastrointestinal tract, you may get ulcers (sores) in your mouth or have stomach pain. In severe cases, blood flow to the intestines can be blocked. This can cause the wall of the intestines to weaken and possibly rupture (burst). A rupture can lead to serious problems or even death. Sinuses, Nose, Throat, and Ears If vasculitis affects your sinuses, nose, throat, and ears, you may have sinus or chronic (ongoing) middle ear infections. Other symptoms include ulcers in the nose and, in some cases, hearing loss. Eyes If vasculitis affects your eyes, you may develop red, itchy, burning eyes. Your eyes also may become sensitive to light, and your vision may blur. Rarely, certain types of vasculitis may cause blindness. Brain If vasculitis affects your brain, symptoms may include headaches, problems thinking clearly, changes in mental function, or stroke-like symptoms, such as muscle weakness and paralysis (an inability to move). Nerves If vasculitis affects your nerves, you may have numbness, tingling, and weakness in various parts of your body. You also may have a loss of feeling or strength in your hands and feet and shooting pains in your arms and legs."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Vasculitis ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose vasculitis based on your signs and symptoms, your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Specialists Involved Depending on the type of vasculitis you have and the organs affected, your doctor may refer you to various specialists, including: A rheumatologist (joint and muscle specialist) An infectious disease specialist A dermatologist (skin specialist) A pulmonologist (lung specialist) A nephrologist (kidney specialist) A neurologist (nervous system specialist) A cardiologist (heart specialist) An ophthalmologist (eye specialist) A urologist (urinary tract and urogenital system specialist) Diagnostic Tests and Procedures Many tests are used to diagnose vasculitis. Blood Tests Blood tests can show whether you have abnormal levels of certain blood cells and antibodies (proteins) in your blood. These tests may look at: Hemoglobin and hematocrit. A low hemoglobin or hematocrit level suggests anemia, a complication of vasculitis. Vasculitis can interfere with the body's ability to make enough red blood cells. Vasculitis also can be linked to increased destruction of red blood cells. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). These antibodies are present in people who have certain types of vasculitis. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). A high ESR may be a sign of inflammation in the body. The amount of C-reactive protein (CRP) in your blood. A high CRP level suggests inflammation. Biopsy A biopsy often is the best way for your doctor to make a firm diagnosis of vasculitis. During a biopsy, your doctor will take a small sample of your body tissue to study under a microscope. He or she will take the tissue sample from a blood vessel or an organ. A pathologist will study the sample for signs of inflammation or tissue damage. A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in identifying diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope. Blood Pressure People who have vasculitis should have their blood pressure checked routinely. Vasculitis that damages the kidneys can cause high blood pressure. Urinalysis For this test, you'll provide a urine sample for analysis. This test detects abnormal levels of protein or blood cells in the urine. Abnormal levels of these substances can be a sign of vasculitis affecting the kidneys. EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. You might have this test to show whether vasculitis is affecting your heart. Echocardiography Echocardiography is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The test gives information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working. Chest X Ray A chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. Abnormal chest x-ray results may show whether vasculitis is affecting your lungs or your large arteries (such as the aorta or the pulmonary arteries). Lung Function Tests Lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. Lung function tests can help your doctor find out whether airflow into and out of your lungs is restricted or blocked. Abdominal Ultrasound An abdominal ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the organs and structures in your abdomen. The picture may show whether vasculitis is affecting your abdominal organs. Computed Tomography Scan A computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scan, or CT scan, is a type of x ray that creates more detailed pictures of your internal organs than a standard x ray. The results from this test can show whether you have a type of vasculitis that affects your abdominal organs or blood vessels. Magnetic Resonance Imaging A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create detailed pictures of your internal organs. Other Advanced Imaging Techniques Several new imaging techniques are now being used to help diagnose vasculitis. Duplex ultrasonography combines an image of the structure of the blood vessel with a color image of the blood flow through that vein or artery. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) identifies areas that show higher glucose metabolism leading to problems in the blood vessels. Angiography Angiography (an-jee-OG-ra-fee) is a test that uses dye and special x rays to show blood flowing through your blood vessels. The dye is injected into your bloodstream. Special x-ray pictures are taken while the dye flows through your blood vessels. The dye helps highlight the vessels on the x-ray pictures. Doctors use angiography to help find out whether blood vessels are narrowed, swollen, deformed, or blocked."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Vasculitis ?","completion":"Treatment for vasculitis will depend on the type of vasculitis you have, which organs are affected, and the severity of the condition. People who have severe vasculitis are treated with prescription medicines. Rarely, surgery may be done. People who have mild vasculitis may find relief with over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen. The main goal of treating vasculitis is to reduce inflammation in the affected blood vessels. This usually is done by reducing or stopping the immune response that caused the inflammation. Types of Treatment Common prescription medicines used to treat vasculitis include corticosteroids and cytotoxic medicines. Corticosteroids help reduce inflammation in your blood vessels. Examples of corticosteroids are prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone. Doctors may prescribe cytotoxic medicines if vasculitis is severe or if corticosteroids don't work well. Cytotoxic medicines kill the cells that are causing the inflammation. Examples of these medicines are azathioprine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide. Your doctor may prescribe both corticosteroids and cytotoxic medicines. Other treatments may be used for certain types of vasculitis. For example, the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease is high-dose aspirin and immune globulin. Immune globulin is a medicine thats injected into a vein. Certain types of vasculitis may require surgery to remove aneurysms that have formed as a result of the condition.

Some people who have severe AAT deficiency develop emphysema (em-fi-SE-ma)often when they're only in their forties or fifties. Emphysema is a serious lung disease in which damage to the airways makes it hard to breathe. A small number of people who have AAT deficiency develop cirrhosis (sir-RO-sis) and other serious liver diseases. Cirrhosis is a disease in which the liver becomes scarred. The scarring prevents the organ from working well. In people who have AAT deficiency, cirrhosis and other liver diseases usually occur in infancy and early childhood. A very small number of people who have AAT deficiency have a rare skin disease called necrotizing panniculitis (pa-NIK-yu-LI-tis). This disease can cause painful lumps under or on the surface of the skin. This article focuses on AAT deficiency as it relates to lung disease. Overview Alpha-1 antitrypsin, also called AAT, is a protein made in the liver. Normally, the protein travels through the bloodstream. It helps protect the body's organs from the harmful effects of other proteins. The lungs are one of the main organs that the AAT protein protects. AAT deficiency occurs if the AAT proteins made in the liver aren't the right shape. They get stuck inside liver cells and can't get into the bloodstream. As a result, not enough AAT proteins travel to the lungs to protect them. This increases the risk of lung disease. Also, because too many AAT proteins are stuck in the liver, liver disease can develop. Severe AAT deficiency occurs if blood levels of the AAT protein fall below the lowest amount needed to protect the lungs. AAT deficiency is an inherited condition. \\"Inherited\\" means it's passed from parents to children through genes. Doctors don't know how many people have AAT deficiency. Many people who have the condition may not know they have it. Estimates of how many people have AAT deficiency range from about 1 in every 1,600 people to about 1 in every 5,000 people. Outlook People who have AAT deficiency may not have serious complications, and they may live close to a normal lifespan. Among people with AAT deficiency who have a related lung or liver disease, about 3percent die each year. Smoking is the leading risk factor for life-threatening lung disease if you have AAT deficiency. Smoking or exposure to tobacco smoke increases the risk of earlier lung-related symptoms and lung damage. If you have severe AAT deficiency, smoking can shorten your life by as much as 20 years. AAT deficiency has no cure, but treatments are available. Treatments often are based on the type of disease you develop."},{"prompt":"What causes Alpha1 Antitrypsin Deficiency ?","completion":"Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is an inherited disease. \\"Inherited\\" means it's passed from parents to children through genes. Children who have AAT deficiency inherit two faulty AAT genes, one from each parent. These genes tell cells in the body how to make AAT proteins. In AAT deficiency, the AAT proteins made in the liver aren't the right shape. Thus, they get stuck in the liver cells. The proteins can't get to the organs in the body that they protect, such as the lungs. Without the AAT proteins protecting the organs, diseases can develop. The most common faulty gene that can cause AAT deficiency is called PiZ. If you inherit two PiZ genes (one from each parent), you'll have AAT deficiency. If you inherit a PiZ gene from one parent and a normal AAT gene from the other parent, you won't have AAT deficiency. However, you might pass the PiZ gene to your children. Even if you inherit two faulty AAT genes, you may not have any related complications. You may never even realize that you have AAT deficiency."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Alpha1 Antitrypsin Deficiency? ?","completion":"Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency occurs in all ethnic groups. However, the condition occurs most often in White people of European descent.

Some people who have severe AAT deficiency develop emphysema (em-fi-SE-ma)often when they're only in their forties or fifties. Signs and symptoms of emphysema include problems breathing, wheezing, and a chronic (ongoing) cough. At first, many people who have AAT deficiency are diagnosed with asthma. This is because wheezing also is a symptom of asthma. Also, people who have AAT deficiency respond well to asthma medicines."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Alpha1 Antitrypsin Deficiency ?","completion":"Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency usually is diagnosed after you develop a lung or liver disease that's related to the condition. Your doctor may suspect AAT deficiency if you have signs or symptoms of a serious lung condition, especially emphysema, without any obvious cause. He or she also may suspect AAT deficiency if you develop emphysema when you're 45 years old or younger. Specialists Involved Many doctors may be involved in the diagnosis of AAT deficiency. These include primary care doctors, pulmonologists (lung specialists), and hepatologists (liver specialists). To diagnose AAT deficiency, your doctor will: Ask about possible risk factors. Risk factors include smoking and exposure to dust, fumes, and other toxic substances. Ask about your medical history. A common sign of AAT deficiency is if you have a lung or liver disease without any obvious causes or risk factors. Another sign is if you have emphysema at an unusually early age (45 years or younger). Ask about your family's medical history. If you have bloodline relatives who have AAT deficiency, you're more likely to have the condition. Diagnostic Tests Your doctor may recommend tests to confirm a diagnosis of AAT deficiency. He or she also may recommend tests to check for lung- or liver-related conditions. A genetic test is the most certain way to check for AAT deficiency. This test will show whether you have faulty AAT genes. A blood test also may be used. This test checks the level of AAT protein in your blood. If the level is a lot lower than normal, it's likely that you have AAT deficiency. Lung-Related Tests If you have a lung disease related to AAT deficiency, your doctor may recommend lung function tests and high-resolution computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scanning, also called CT scanning. Lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests may show how severe your lung disease is and how well treatment is working. High-resolution CT scanning uses x rays to create detailed pictures of parts of the body.

Most of these treatments are the same as the ones used for a lung disease called COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). If you have symptoms related to AAT deficiency, your doctor may recommend: Medicines called inhaled bronchodilators (brong-ko-di-LA-tors) and inhaled steroids. These medicines help open your airways and make breathing easier. They also are used to treat asthma and COPD. Flu and pneumococcal (noo-mo-KOK-al) vaccines to protect you from illnesses that could make your condition worse. Prompt treatment of lung infections also can help protect your lungs. Pulmonary rehabilitation (rehab). Rehab involves treatment by a team of experts at a special clinic. In rehab, you'll learn how to manage your condition and function at your best. Extra oxygen, if needed. A lung transplant. A lung transplant may be an option if you have severe breathing problems. If you have a good chance of surviving the transplant surgery, you may be a candidate for it. Augmentation (og-men-TA-shun) therapy is a treatment used only for people who have AAT-related lung diseases. This therapy involves getting infusions of the AAT protein. The infusions raise the level of the protein in your blood and lungs. Not enough research has been done to show how well this therapy works. However, some research suggests that this therapy may slow the development of AAT deficiency in people who don't have severe disease. People who have AAT deficiency and develop related liver or skin diseases will be referred to doctors who treat those diseases. Future Treatments Researchers are working on possible treatments that will target the faulty AAT genes and replace them with healthy genes. These treatments are in the early stages of development. Researchers also are studying therapies that will help misshapen AAT proteins move from the liver into the bloodstream. They're also studying a type of augmentation therapy in which the AAT protein is inhaled instead of injected into a vein.

If you inherit two faulty AAT genes, you'll have AAT deficiency. Even so, you may never develop one of the diseases related to the condition. You can take steps to prevent or delay lung diseases related to AAT deficiency. One important step is to quit smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.

Secretory glands include glands that make mucus and sweat. \\"Inherited\\" means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. People who have CF inherit two faulty genes for the diseaseone from each parent. The parents likely don't have the disease themselves. CF mainly affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs. Overview Mucus is a substance made by tissues that line some organs and body cavities, such as the lungs and nose. Normally, mucus is a slippery, watery substance. It keeps the linings of certain organs moist and prevents them from drying out or getting infected. If you have CF, your mucus becomes thick and sticky. It builds up in your lungs and blocks your airways. (Airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs.) The buildup of mucus makes it easy for bacteria to grow. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections. Over time, these infections can severely damage your lungs. The thick, sticky mucus also can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). As a result, the digestive enzymes that your pancreas makes can't reach your small intestine. These enzymes help break down food. Without them, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition because nutrients pass through your body without being used. You also may have bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly from severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. CF also causes your sweat to become very salty. Thus, when you sweat, you lose large amounts of salt. This can upset the balance of minerals in your blood and cause many health problems. Examples of these problems include dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. If you or your child has CF, you're also at higher risk for diabetes or two bone-thinning conditions called osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis) and osteopenia (OS-te-o-PEE-nee-uh). CF also causes infertility in men, and the disease can make it harder for women to get pregnant. (The term \\"infertility\\" refers to the inability to have children.) Outlook The symptoms and severity of CF vary. If you or your child has the disease, you may have serious lung and digestive problems. If the disease is mild, symptoms may not show up until the teen or adult years. The symptoms and severity of CF also vary over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. As the disease gets worse, you'll have more severe symptoms more often. Lung function often starts to decline in early childhood in people who have CF. Over time, damage to the lungs can cause severe breathing problems. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people who have CF. As treatments for CF continue to improve, so does life expectancy for those who have the disease. Today, some people who have CF are living into their forties or fifties, or longer. Early treatment for CF can improve your quality of life and increase your lifespan. Treatments may include nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines, exercise, and other treatments. Your doctor also may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems."},{"prompt":"What causes Cystic Fibrosis ?","completion":"A defect in the CFTR gene causes cystic fibrosis (CF). This gene makes a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your body's cells. In people who have CF, the gene makes a protein that doesn't work well. This causes thick, sticky mucus and very salty sweat. Research suggests that the CFTR protein also affects the body in other ways. This may help explain other symptoms and complications of CF. More than a thousand known defects can affect the CFTR gene. The type of defect you or your child has may affect the severity of CF. Other genes also may play a role in the severity of the disease. How Is Cystic Fibrosis Inherited? Every person inherits two CFTR genesone from each parent. Children who inherit a faulty CFTR gene from each parent will have CF. Children who inherit one faulty CFTR gene and one normal CFTR gene are \\"CF carriers.\\" CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives.

However, the disease is most common among Caucasians of Northern European descent. CF also is common among Latinos and American Indians, especially the Pueblo and Zuni. The disease is less common among African Americans and Asian Americans. More than 10 million Americans are carriers of a faulty CF gene. Many of them don't know that they're CF carriers."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Cystic Fibrosis ?","completion":"The signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF) vary from person to person and over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. One of the first signs of CF that parents may notice is that their baby's skin tastes salty when kissed, or the baby doesn't pass stool when first born. Most of the other signs and symptoms of CF happen later. They're related to how CF affects the respiratory, digestive, or reproductive systems of the body. Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory System Signs and Symptoms People who have CF have thick, sticky mucus that builds up in their airways. This buildup of mucus makes it easier for bacteria to grow and cause infections. Infections can block the airways and cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum (spit) or mucus that's sometimes bloody. People who have CF tend to have lung infections caused by unusual germs that don't respond to standard antibiotics. For example, lung infections caused by bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas are much more common in people who have CF than in those who don't. An infection caused by these bacteria may be a sign of CF. People who have CF have frequent bouts of sinusitis (si-nu-SI-tis), an infection of the sinuses. The sinuses are hollow air spaces around the eyes, nose, and forehead. Frequent bouts of bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) and pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) also can occur. These infections can cause long-term lung damage. As CF gets worse, you may have more serious problems, such as pneumothorax (noo-mo-THOR-aks) or bronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-ta-sis). Some people who have CF also develop nasal polyps (growths in the nose) that may require surgery. Digestive System Signs and Symptoms In CF, mucus can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). These blockages prevent enzymes from reaching your intestines. As a result, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause ongoing diarrhea or bulky, foul-smelling, greasy stools. Intestinal blockages also may occur, especially in newborns. Too much gas or severe constipation in the intestines may cause stomach pain and discomfort. A hallmark of CF in children is poor weight gain and growth. These children are unable to get enough nutrients from their food because of the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins. As CF gets worse, other problems may occur, such as: Pancreatitis (PAN-kre-ah-TI-tis). This is a condition in which the pancreas become inflamed, which causes pain. Rectal prolapse. Frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside you to move out of your rectum. Liver disease due to inflamed or blocked bile ducts. Diabetes. Gallstones. Reproductive System Signs and Symptoms Men who have CF are infertile because they're born without a vas deferens. The vas deferens is a tube that delivers sperm from the testes to the penis. Women who have CF may have a hard time getting pregnant because of mucus blocking the cervix or other CF complications. Other Signs, Symptoms, and Complications Other signs and symptoms of CF are related to an upset of the balance of minerals in your blood. CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. This can cause dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. CF also can cause clubbing and low bone density. Clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of your fingers and toes. This sign develops late in CF because your lungs aren't moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream. Low bone density also tends to occur late in CF. It can lead to bone-thinning disorders called osteoporosis and osteopenia."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Cystic Fibrosis ?","completion":"Doctors diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF) based on the results from various tests. Newborn Screening All States screen newborns for CF using a genetic test or a blood test. The genetic test shows whether a newborn has faulty CFTR genes. The blood test shows whether a newborn's pancreas is working properly. Sweat Test If a genetic test or blood test suggests CF, a doctor will confirm the diagnosis using a sweat test. This test is the most useful test for diagnosing CF. A sweat test measures the amount of salt in sweat. For this test, the doctor triggers sweating on a small patch of skin on an arm or leg. He or she rubs the skin with a sweat-producing chemical and then uses an electrode to provide a mild electrical current. This may cause a tingling or warm feeling. Sweat is collected on a pad or paper and then analyzed. The sweat test usually is done twice. High salt levels confirm a diagnosis of CF. Other Tests If you or your child has CF, your doctor may recommend other tests, such as: Genetic tests to find out what type of CFTR defect is causing your CF. A chest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can show whether your lungs are inflamed or scarred, or whether they trap air. A sinus x ray. This test may show signs of sinusitis, a complication of CF. Lung function tests. These tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. A sputum culture. For this test, your doctor will take a sample of your sputum (spit) to see whether bacteria are growing in it. If you have bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas, you may have more advanced CF that needs aggressive treatment. Prenatal Screening If you're pregnant, prenatal genetic tests can show whether your fetus has CF. These tests include amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS). In amniocentesis, your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus. He or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby. The fluid is tested to see whether both of the baby's CFTR genes are normal. In CVS, your doctor threads a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta. The doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The sample is tested to see whether the baby has CF. Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Testing People who have one normal CFTR gene and one faulty CFTR gene are CF carriers. CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, carriers can pass faulty CFTR genes on to their children. If you have a family history of CF or a partner who has CF (or a family history of it) and you're planning a pregnancy, you may want to find out whether you're a CF carrier. A genetics counselor can test a blood or saliva sample to find out whether you have a faulty CF gene. This type of testing can detect faulty CF genes in 9 out of 10 cases."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Cystic Fibrosis ?","completion":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) has no cure.

The goals of CF treatment include: Preventing and controlling lung infections Loosening and removing thick, sticky mucus from the lungs Preventing or treating blockages in the intestines Providing enough nutrition Preventing dehydration (a lack of fluid in the body) Depending on the severity of CF, you or your child may be treated in a hospital. Specialists Involved If you or your child has CF, you may be treated by a CF specialist. This is a doctor who is familiar with the complex nature of CF. Often, a CF specialist works with a medical team of nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, and social workers. CF specialists often are located at major medical centers. The United States also has more than 100 CF Care Centers. These centers have teams of doctors, nurses, dietitians, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and social workers who have special training related to CF care. Most CF Care Centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics. For more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page. Treatment for Lung Problems The main treatments for lung problems in people who have CF are chest physical therapy (CPT), exercise, and medicines. Your doctor also may recommend a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program. Chest Physical Therapy CPT also is called chest clapping or percussion. It involves pounding your chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen the mucus from your lungs so that you can cough it up. You might sit down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs. Some people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices have been developed that may help with CPT, such as: An electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor. An inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency airwaves to force the mucus that's deep in your lungs toward your upper airways so you can cough it up. A small, handheld device that you exhale through. The device causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus. A mask that creates vibrations that help break the mucus loose from your airway walls. Breathing techniques also may help dislodge mucus so you can cough it up. These techniques include forcing out a couple of short breaths or deeper breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. This may help loosen the mucus in your lungs and open your airways. Exercise Aerobic exercise that makes you breathe harder can help loosen the mucus in your airways so you can cough it up. Exercise also helps improve your overall physical condition. However, CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. Thus, your doctor may recommend a high-salt diet or salt supplements to maintain the balance of minerals in your blood. If you exercise regularly, you may be able to cut back on your CPT. However, you should check with your doctor first. Medicines If you have CF, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, bronchodilators, or medicines to help clear the mucus. These medicines help treat or prevent lung infections, reduce swelling and open up the airways, and thin mucus. If you have mutations in a gene called G551D, which occurs in about 5 percent of people who have CF, your doctor may prescribe the oral medicine ivacaftor (approved for people with CF who are 6 years of age and older). Antibiotics are the main treatment to prevent or treat lung infections. Your doctor may prescribe oral, inhaled, or intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Oral antibiotics often are used to treat mild lung infections. Inhaled antibiotics may be used to prevent or control infections caused by the bacteria mucoid Pseudomonas. For severe or hard-to-treat infections, you may be given antibiotics through an IV tube (a tube inserted into a vein). This type of treatment may require you to stay in a hospital. Anti-inflammatory medicines can help reduce swelling in your airways due to ongoing infections. These medicines may be inhaled or oral. Bronchodilators help open the airways by relaxing the muscles around them. These medicines are inhaled. They're often taken just before CPT to help clear mucus out of your airways. You also may take bronchodilators before inhaling other medicines into your lungs. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce the stickiness of your mucus and loosen it up. These medicines can help clear out mucus, improve lung function, and prevent worsening lung symptoms. Treatments for Advanced Lung Disease If you have advanced lung disease, you may need oxygen therapy. Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask. If other treatments haven't worked, a lung transplant may be an option if you have severe lung disease. A lung transplant is surgery to remove a person's diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a deceased donor. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend PR as part of your treatment plan. PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. PR doesn't replace medical therapy. Instead, it's used with medical therapy and may include: Exercise training Nutritional counseling Education on your lung disease or condition and how to manage it Energy-conserving techniques Breathing strategies Psychological counseling and/or group support PR has many benefits. It can improve your ability to function and your quality of life. The program also may help relieve your breathing problems. Even if you have advanced lung disease, you can still benefit from PR. For more information, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Rehabilitation article. Treatment for Digestive Problems CF can cause many digestive problems, such as bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly, severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. Digestive problems also can lead to poor growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy can improve your strength and ability to stay active. It also can improve growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy also may make you strong enough to resist some lung infections. A nutritionist can help you create a nutritional plan that meets your needs. In addition to having a well-balanced diet that's rich in calories, fat, and protein, your nutritional therapy may include: Oral pancreatic enzymes to help you digest fats and proteins and absorb more vitamins. Supplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K to replace the fat-soluble vitamins that your intestines can't absorb. High-calorie shakes to provide you with extra nutrients. A high-salt diet or salt supplements that you take before exercising. A feeding tube to give you more calories at night while you're sleeping. The tube may be threaded through your nose and throat and into your stomach. Or, the tube may be placed directly into your stomach through a surgically made hole. Before you go to bed each night, you'll attach a bag with a nutritional solution to the entrance of the tube. It will feed you while you sleep. Other treatments for digestive problems may include enemas and mucus-thinning medicines to treat intestinal blockages. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove an intestinal blockage. Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to reduce your stomach acid and help oral pancreatic enzymes work better. Treatments for Cystic Fibrosis Complications A common complication of CF is diabetes. The type of diabetes associated with CF often requires different treatment than other types of diabetes. Another common CF complication is the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that prevent your bones from losing their density."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Peripheral Artery Disease ?","completion":"Peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) is a disease in which plaque builds up in the arteries that carry blood to your head, organs, and limbs. Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, fibrous tissue, and other substances in the blood. When plaque builds up in the body's arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis. Over time, plaque can harden and narrow the arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your organs and other parts of your body. P.A.D. usually affects the arteries in the legs, but it also can affect the arteries that carry blood from your heart to your head, arms, kidneys, and stomach. This article focuses on P.A.D. that affects blood flow to the legs. Normal Artery and Artery With Plaque Buildup Overview Blocked blood flow to your legs can cause pain and numbness. It also can raise your risk of getting an infection in the affected limbs. Your body may have a hard time fighting the infection. If severe enough, blocked blood flow can cause gangrene (tissue death). In very serious cases, this can lead to leg amputation. If you have leg pain when you walk or climb stairs, talk with your doctor. Sometimes older people think that leg pain is just a symptom of aging. However, the cause of the pain could be P.A.D. Tell your doctor if you're feeling pain in your legs and discuss whether you should be tested for P.A.D. Smoking is the main risk factor for P.A.D. If you smoke or have a history of smoking, your risk of P.A.D. increases. Other factors, such as age and having certain diseases or conditions, also increase your risk of P.A.D. Outlook P.A.D. increases your risk of coronary heart disease, heart attack, stroke, and transient ischemic attack(\\"mini-stroke\\").Although P.A.D. is serious, it's treatable. If you have the disease, see your doctor regularly and treat the underlying atherosclerosis.P.A.D. treatment may slow or stop disease progress and reduce the risk of complications. Treatments include lifestyle changes, medicines, and surgery or procedures. Researchers continue to explore new therapies for P.A.D."},{"prompt":"What causes Peripheral Artery Disease ?","completion":"The most common cause of peripheral arterydisease (P.A.D.) is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up in your arteries. The exact cause of atherosclerosis isn't known. The disease may start if certain factors damage the inner layers of the arteries. These factors include: Smoking High amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood High blood pressure High amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes When damage occurs, your body starts a healing process. The healing may cause plaque to build up where the arteries are damaged. Eventually, a section of plaque can rupture (break open), causing a blood clot to form at the site. The buildup of plaque or blood clots can severely narrow or block the arteries and limit the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Peripheral Artery Disease? ?","completion":"Peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) affects millions of people in the United States. The disease is more common in blacks than any other racial or ethnic group.The major risk factors for P.A.D. are smoking, older age, and having certain diseases or conditions. Smoking Smoking is the main risk factor for P.A.D. and your risk increases if you smoke or have a history of smoking. Quitting smoking slows the progress of P.A.D. People who smoke and people who have diabetes are at highest risk for P.A.D. complications, such as gangrene (tissue death) in the leg from decreased blood flow. Older Age Older age also is a risk factor for P.A.D. Plaque builds up in your arteries as you age.Older age combined with other risk factors, such as smoking or diabetes, also puts you at higher risk for P.A.D. Diseases and Conditions Many diseases and conditions can raise your risk of P.A.D., including: Diabetes High blood pressure High blood cholesterol Coronary heart disease Stroke Metabolic syndrome"},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Peripheral Artery Disease ?","completion":"Many people who have peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) dont have any signs or symptoms. Even if you don't have signs or symptoms, ask your doctor whether you should get checked for P.A.D. if you're: Aged 70 or older Aged 50 or older and have a history of smoking or diabetes Younger than 50 and have diabetes and one or more risk factors for atherosclerosis Intermittent Claudication People who have P.A.D. may have symptoms when walking or climbing stairs, which may include pain, numbness, aching, or heaviness in the leg muscles.Symptoms also may include cramping in the affected leg(s) and in the buttocks, thighs, calves, and feet. Symptoms may ease after resting.These symptoms are called intermittent claudication. During physical activity, your muscles need increased blood flow. If your blood vessels are narrowed or blocked, your muscles won't get enough blood, which will lead to symptoms. When resting, the muscles need less blood flow, so the symptoms will go away. Other Signs and Symptoms Other signs and symptoms of P.A.D. include: Weak or absent pulses in the legs or feet Sores or wounds on the toes, feet, or legs that heal slowly, poorly, or not at all A pale or bluish color to the skin A lower temperature in one leg compared to the other leg Poor nail growth on the toes and decreased hair growth on the legs Erectile dysfunction, especially among men who have diabetes"},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Peripheral Artery Disease ?","completion":"Peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) is diagnosed based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results. P.A.D. often is diagnosed after symptoms are reported. A correct diagnosis is important because people who have P.A.D. are at higher risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), heart attack, stroke, and transient ischemic attack (\\"mini-stroke\\"). If you have P.A.D., your doctor also may want to check for signs of these diseases and conditions. Specialists Involved Primary care doctors, such as internists and family doctors, may treat people who have mild P.A.D. For more advanced P.A.D., a vascular specialist may be involved. This is a doctor who specializes in treating blood vessel diseases and conditions. A cardiologist also may be involved in treating people who have P.A.D. Cardiologists treat heart problems, such as CHD and heart attack, which often affect people who have P.A.D. Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask: Whether you have any risk factors for P.A.D. For example, he or she may ask whether you smoke or have diabetes. About your symptoms, including any symptoms that occur when walking, exercising, sitting, standing, or climbing. About your diet. About any medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines. Whether anyone in your family has a history of heart or blood vessel diseases. Physical Exam During the physical exam, your doctor will look for signs of P.A.D. He or she may check the blood flow in your legs or feet to see whether you have weak or absent pulses. Your doctor also may check the pulses in your leg arteries for an abnormal whooshing sound called a bruit. He or she can hear this sound with a stethoscope. A bruit may be a warning sign of a narrowed or blocked artery. Your doctor may compare blood pressure between your limbs to see whether the pressure is lower in the affected limb. He or she also may check for poor wound healing or any changes in your hair, skin, or nails that may be signs of P.A.D. Diagnostic Tests Ankle-Brachial Index A simple test called an ankle-brachial index (ABI) often is used to diagnose P.A.D. The ABI compares blood pressure in your ankle to blood pressure in your arm. This test shows how well blood is flowing in your limbs. ABI can show whether P.A.D. is affecting your limbs, but it won't show which blood vessels are narrowed or blocked. A normal ABI result is 1.0 or greater (with a range of 0.90 to 1.30). The test takes about 10 to 15 minutes to measure both arms and both ankles. This test may be done yearly to see whether P.A.D. is getting worse. Ankle-Brachial Index Doppler Ultrasound A Doppler ultrasound looks at blood flow in the major arteries and veins in the limbs. During this test, a handheld device is placed on your body and passed back and forth over the affected area. A computer converts sound waves into a picture of blood flow in the arteries and veins. The results of this test can show whether a blood vessel is blocked. The results also can help show the severity of P.A.D. Treadmill Test A treadmill test can show the severity of symptoms and the level of exercise that brings them on. You'll walk on a treadmill for this test. This shows whether you have any problems during normal walking. You may have an ABI test before and after the treadmill test. This will help compare blood flow in your arms and legs before and after exercise. Magnetic Resonance Angiogram A magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) uses magnetic and radio wave energy to take pictures of your blood vessels. This test is a type of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRA can show the location and severity of a blocked blood vessel. If you have a pacemaker, man-made joint, stent, surgical clips, mechanical heart valve, or other metallic devices in your body, you might not be able to have an MRA. Ask your doctor whether an MRA is an option for you. Arteriogram An arteriogram provides a \\"road map\\" of the arteries. Doctors use this test to find the exact location of a blocked artery. For this test, dye is injected through a needle or catheter (tube) into one of your arteries. This may make you feel mildly flushed. After the dye is injected, an x ray is taken. The xray can show the location, type, and extent of the blockage in the artery. Some doctors use a newer method of arteriogram that uses tiny ultrasound cameras. These cameras take pictures of the insides of the blood vessels. This method is called intravascular ultrasound. Blood Tests Your doctor may recommend blood tests to check for P.A.D. risk factors. For example, blood tests can help diagnose conditions such as diabetes and high blood cholesterol."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Peripheral Artery Disease ?","completion":"Treatments for peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) include lifestyle changes, medicines, and surgery or procedures. The overall goals of treating P.A.D. include reducing risk of heart attack and stroke; reducing symptoms of claudication; improving mobility and overall quality of life; and preventing complications. Treatment is based on your signs and symptoms, risk factors, and the results of physical exams and tests. Treatment may slow or stop the progression of the disease and reduce the risk of complications. Without treatment, P.A.D. may progress, resulting in serious tissue damage in the form of sores or gangrene (tissue death) due to inadequate blood flow. In extreme cases of P.A.D., also referred to as critical limb ischemia (CLI), removal (amputation) of part of the leg or foot may be necessary. Lifestyle Changes Treatment often includes making long-lasting lifestyle changes, such as: Physical activity Quitting smoking Heart-healthy eating Physical Activity Routine physical activity can improve P.A.D. symptoms and lower many risk factors for atherosclerosis, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Exercise can improve the distances you can comfortably walk. Talk with your doctor about taking part in a supervised exercise program. If a supervised program is not an option, ask your doctor to help you develop an exercise plan. Most exercise programs begin slowly, which includes simple walking alternating with rest. Over time, most people build up the amount of time they can walk before developing pain. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Quitting Smoking If you smoke, quit. Smoking raises your risk for P.A.D. Smoking also raises your risk for other diseases, such as coronary heart disease and heart attack, and worsens other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhandsmoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Read more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart. Heart-Healthy Eating Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating to treat atherosclerosis, the most common cause of P.A.D. Following heart-healthy eating can help control blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which can lead to atherosclerosis. Medicines Your doctor may prescribe medicines to: Prevent blood clots from forming due to low blood flow with anticlotting medicines, such as aspirin. Treat unhealthy cholesterol levels with statins. Statins control or lower blood cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of developing complications from P.A.D. Treat high blood pressure with one of many high blood pressure medicines. Help ease leg pain that occurs when you walk or climb stairs. Reduce the symptoms of intermittent claudication, measured by increased walking distance with certain platelet-aggregation inhibitors. Surgery or Procedures Bypass Grafting Your doctor may recommend bypass grafting surgery if blood flow in your limb is blocked or nearly blocked. For this surgery, your doctor uses a blood vessel from another part of your body or a synthetic tube to make a graft. This graft bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked part of the artery. The bypass allows blood to flow around the blockage. This surgery doesnt cure P.A.D., but it may increase blood flow to the affected limb. Angioplasty and Stent Placement Your doctor may recommend angioplasty to restore blood flow through a narrowed or blockedartery. During this procedure, a catheter (thin tube) with a balloon at the tip is inserted into a blocked artery. The balloon is then inflated, which pushes plaque outward against the artery wall. This widens the artery and restores blood flow. A stent (a small mesh tube) may be placed in the artery during angioplasty. A stent helps keep the artery open after angioplasty is done. Some stents are coated with medicine to help prevent blockages in the artery. Atherectomy Atherectomy is a procedure that removes plaque buildup from an artery. During the procedure, a catheter is used to insert a small cutting device into the blocked artery. The device is used to shave or cut off plaque. The bits of plaque are removed from the body through the catheter or washed away in the bloodstream (if theyre small enough). Doctors also can perform atherectomy using a special laser that dissolves the blockage. Other Types of Treatment Researchers are studying cell and gene therapies to treat P.A.D. However, these treatments arent yet available outside of clinical trials.

This disease affects your bodys organs. Normally, your immune system defends your body against foreign or harmful substances. For example, it sends special cells to protect organs that are in danger. These cells release chemicals that recruit other cells to isolate and destroy the harmful substance. Inflammation occurs during this process. Once the harmful substance is gone, the cells and the inflammation go away. In people who have sarcoidosis, the inflammation doesn't go away. Instead, some of the immune system cells cluster to form lumps called granulomas (gran-yu-LO-mas) in various organs in your body. Overview Sarcoidosis can affect any organ in your body. However, it's more likely to affect some organs than others. The disease usually starts in the lungs, skin, and/or lymph nodes (especially the lymph nodes in your chest). Also, the disease often affects the eyes and liver. Although less common, sarcoidosis can affect the heart and brain, leading to serious complications. If many granulomas form in an organ, they can affect how the organ works. This can cause signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms vary depending on which organs are affected. Many people who have sarcoidosis have no signs or symptoms or mild ones. Lofgren's syndrome is a classic set of signs and symptoms that is typical in some people who have sarcoidosis. Lofgren's syndrome may cause fever, enlarged lymph nodes, arthritis (usually in the ankles), and/or erythema nodosum (er-ih-THE-ma no-DO-sum). Erythema nodosum is a rash of red or reddish-purple bumps on your ankles and shins. The rash may be warm and tender to the touch. Treatment for sarcoidosis varies depending on which organs are affected. Your doctor may prescribe topical treatments and/or medicines to treat the disease. Not everyone who has sarcoidosis needs treatment. Outlook The outlook for sarcoidosis varies. Many people recover from the disease with few or no long-term problems. More than half of the people who have sarcoidosis have remission within 3 years of diagnosis. Remission means the disease isn't active, but it can return. Two-thirds of people who have the disease have remission within 10 years of diagnosis. People who have Lofgren's syndrome usually have remission. Relapse (return of the disease) 1 or more years after remission occurs in less than 5 percent of patients. Sarcoidosis leads to organ damage in about one-third of the people diagnosed with the disease. Damage may occur over many years and involve more than one organ. Rarely, sarcoidosis can be fatal. Death usually is the result of problems with the lungs, heart, or brain. Poor outcomes are more likely in people who have advanced disease and show little improvement from treatment. Certain people are at higher risk for poor outcomes from chronic (long-term) sarcoidosis. This includes people who have lung scarring, heart or brain complications, or lupus pernio (LU-pus PUR-ne-o).

Often, the disease is found when a chest x ray is done for another reason (for example, to diagnose pneumonia). The signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis vary depending on which organs are affected. Signs and symptoms also may vary depending on your gender, age, and ethnic background. (For more information, go to \\"Who Is at Risk for Sarcoidosis?\\") Common Signs and Symptoms In both adults and children, sarcoidosis most often affects the lungs. If granulomas (inflamed lumps) form in your lungs, you may wheeze, cough, feel short of breath, or have chest pain. Or, you may have no symptoms at all. Some people who have sarcoidosis feel very tired, uneasy, or depressed. Night sweats and weight loss are common symptoms of the disease. Common signs and symptoms in children are fatigue (tiredness), loss of appetite, weight loss, bone and joint pain, and anemia. Children who are younger than 4 years old may have a distinct form of sarcoidosis. It may cause enlarged lymph nodes in the chest (which can be seen on chest x-ray pictures), skin lesions, and eye swelling or redness. Other Signs and Symptoms Sarcoidosis may affect your lymph nodes. The disease can cause enlarged lymph nodes that feel tender. Sarcoidosis usually affects the lymph nodes in your neck and chest. However, the disease also may affect the lymph nodes under your chin, in your armpits, or in your groin. Sarcoidosis can cause lumps, ulcers (sores), or areas of discolored skin. These areas may itch, but they don't hurt. These signs tend to appear on your back, arms, legs, and scalp. Sometimes they appear near your nose or eyes. These signs usually last a long time. Sarcoidosis may cause a more serious skin condition called lupus pernio. Disfiguring skin sores may affect your nose, nasal passages, cheeks, ears, eyelids, and fingers. These sores tend to be ongoing. They can return after treatment is over. Sarcoidosis also can cause eye problems. If you have sarcoidosis, having an annual eye exam is important. If you have changes in your vision and can't see as clearly or can't see color, call 911 or have someone drive you to the emergency room. You should call your doctor if you have any new eye symptoms, such as burning, itching, tearing, pain, or sensitivity to light. Signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis also may include an enlarged liver, spleen, or salivary glands. Although less common, sarcoidosis can affect the heart and brain. This can cause many symptoms, such as abnormal heartbeats, shortness of breath, headaches, and vision problems. If sarcoidosis affects the heart or brain, serious complications can occur. Lofgren's Syndrome Lofgren's syndrome is a classic set of signs and symptoms that occur in some people when they first have sarcoidosis. Signs and symptoms may include: Fever. This symptom only occurs in some people. Enlarged lymph nodes (which can be seen on a chest x ray). Arthritis, usually in the ankles. This symptom is more common in men than women. Erythema nodosum. This is a rash of red or reddish-purple bumps on your ankles and shins. The rash may be warm and tender to the touch. This symptom is more common in women than men. Sarcoidosis Signs and Symptoms"},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Sarcoidosis ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose sarcoidosis based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. He or she will look for granulomas (inflamed lumps) in your organs. Your doctor also will try to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. Medical History Your doctor may ask you detailed questions about your medical history. For example, he or she may ask whether you: Have a family history of sarcoidosis. Have had any jobs that may have raised your risk for the disease. Have ever been exposed to inhaled beryllium metal. (This type of metal is used to make aircrafts and weapons.) Have had contact with organic dust from birds or hay. Exposure to beryllium metal and organic dust can cause inflamed lumps in your lungs that look like the granulomas from sarcoidosis. However, these lumps are signs of other conditions. Physical Exam Your doctor will check you for signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis. Signs and symptoms may include red bumps on your skin; swollen lymph nodes; an enlarged liver, spleen, or salivary glands; or redness in your eyes. Your doctor also will check for other causes of your symptoms. Your doctor may listen to your lungs and heart. Abnormal breathing or heartbeat sounds could be a sign that sarcoidosis is affecting your lungs or heart. Diagnostic Tests You may have tests to confirm a diagnosis and to find out how sarcoidosis is affecting you. Tests include a chest x ray, lung function tests, biopsy, and other tests to assess organ damage. Chest X Ray A chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart and lungs. The test may show granulomas or enlarged lymph nodes in your chest. About 95 percent of people who have sarcoidosis have abnormal chest xrays. Lung Function Tests Lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can show whether sarcoidosis is affecting your lungs. Biopsy Your doctor may do a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis or rule out other causes of your symptoms. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of tissue from one of your affected organs. Usually, doctors try to biopsy the organs that are easiest to access. Examples include the skin, tear glands, or the lymph nodes that are just under the skin. If this isn't possible, your doctor may use a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to pinpoint areas for biopsy. For this test, a small amount of radioactive substance is injected into a vein, usually in your arm. The substance, which releases energy, travels through the blood and collects in organs or tissues. Special cameras detect the energy and convert it into three-dimensional (3D) pictures. If lung function tests or a chest x ray shows signs of sarcoidosis in your lungs, your doctor may do a bronchoscopy (bron-KOS-ko-pee) to get a small sample of lung tissue. During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube is passed through your nose (or sometimes your mouth), down your throat, and into the airways to reach your lung tissue. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Bronchoscopy article.) Other Tests To Assess Organ Damage You also may have other tests to assess organ damage and find out whether you need treatment. For example, your doctor may recommend blood tests and/or an EKG (electrocardiogram). If youre diagnosed with sarcoidosis, you should see an ophthalmologist (eye specialist), even if you dont have eye symptoms. In sarcoidosis, eye damage can occur without symptoms."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Sarcoidosis ?","completion":"Not everyone who has sarcoidosis needs treatment. Sometimes the disease goes away on its own. Whether you need treatment and what type of treatment you need depend on your signs and symptoms, which organs are affected, and whether those organs are working well. If the disease affects certain organssuch as your eyes, heart, or brainyou'll need treatment even if you don't have any symptoms. In either case, whether you have symptoms or not, you should see your doctor for ongoing care. He or she will want to check to make sure that the disease isn't damaging your organs. For example, you may need routine lung function tests to make sure that your lungs are working well. If the disease isn't worsening, your doctor may watch you closely to see whether the disease goes away on its own. If the disease does start to get worse, your doctor can prescribe treatment. The goals of treatment include: Relieving symptoms Improving organ function Controlling inflammation and reducing the size of granulomas (inflamed lumps) Preventing pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring) if your lungs are affected Your doctor may prescribe topical treatments and/or medicines to treat the disease. Medicines Prednisone Prednisone, a type of steroid, is the main treatment for sarcoidosis. This medicine reduces inflammation. In most people, prednisone relieves symptoms within a couple of months. Although most people need to take prednisone for 12 months or longer, your doctor may lower the dose within a few months after you start the medicine. Long-term use of prednisone, especially at high doses, can cause serious side effects. Work with your doctor to decide whether the benefits of this medicine outweigh the risks. If your doctor prescribes this treatment, he or she will find the lowest dose that controls your disease. When you stop taking prednisone, you should cut back slowly (as your doctor advises). This will help prevent flareups of sarcoidosis. Cutting back slowly also allows your body to adjust to not having the medicine. If a relapse or flareup occurs after you stop taking prednisone, you may need a second round of treatment. If you remain stable for more than 1 year after stopping this treatment, the risk of relapse is low. Other Medicines Other medicines, besides prednisone, also are used to treat sarcoidosis. Examples include: Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (known as antimalarial medicines). These medicines work best for treating sarcoidosis that affects the skin or brain. Your doctor also may prescribe an antimalarial if you have a high level of calcium in your blood due to sarcoidosis. Medicines that suppress the immune system, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or leflunomide. These medicines work best for treating sarcoidosis that affects your lungs, eyes, skin, or joints. Your doctor may prescribe these medicines if your sarcoidosis worsens while you're taking prednisone or if you can't handle prednisone's side effects. If you have Lofgren's syndrome with pain or fever, your doctor may prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. If you're wheezing and coughing, you may need inhaled medicine to help open your airways. You take inhaled medicine using an inhaler. This device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs. Anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, originally developed to treat arthritis, are being studied to treat sarcoidosis. Ongoing Research Researchers continue to look for new and better treatments for sarcoidosis. They're currently studying treatments aimed at the immune system. Researchers also are studying antibiotics as a possible treatment for sarcoidosis that affects the skin. For more information about ongoing research, go to the Clinical Trials section of this article."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Thrombocytopenia ?","completion":"Thrombocytopenia (THROM-bo-si-to-PE-ne-ah) is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets). Platelets are made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells. They travel through your blood vessels and stick together (clot) to stop any bleeding that may happen if a blood vessel is damaged. Platelets also are called thrombocytes (THROM-bo-sites) because a clot also is called a thrombus. Overview When your blood has too few platelets, mild to serious bleeding can occur. Bleeding can occur inside your body (internal bleeding) or underneath your skin or from the surface of your skin (external bleeding). A normal platelet count in adults ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. A platelet count of less than 150,000 platelets per microliter is lower than normal. If your blood platelet count falls below normal, you have thrombocytopenia. However, the risk for serious bleeding doesn't occur until the count becomes very lowless than 10,000 or 20,000 platelets per microliter. Mild bleeding sometimes occurs when the count is less than 50,000 platelets per microliter. Many factors can cause a low platelet count, such as: The body's bone marrow doesn't make enough platelets. The bone marrow makes enough platelets, but the body destroys them or uses them up. The spleen holds on to too many platelets. The spleen is an organ that normally stores about one-third of the body's platelets. It also helps your body fight infection and remove unwanted cell material. A combination of the above factors. How long thrombocytopenia lasts depends on its cause. It can last from days to years. The treatment for this condition also depends on its cause and severity. Mild thrombocytopenia often doesn't require treatment. If the condition causes or puts you at risk for serious bleeding, you may need medicines or blood or platelet transfusions. Rarely, the spleen may need to be removed. Outlook Thrombocytopenia can be fatal, especially if the bleeding is severe or occurs in the brain. However, the overall outlook for people who have the condition is good, especially if the cause of the low platelet count is found and treated."},{"prompt":"What causes Thrombocytopenia ?","completion":"Many factors can cause thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count). The condition can be inherited or acquired. \\"Inherited\\" means your parents pass the gene for the condition to you. \\"Acquired\\" means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it. Sometimes the cause of thrombocytopenia isn't known. In general, a low platelet count occurs because: The body's bone marrow doesn't make enough platelets. The bone marrow makes enough platelets, but the body destroys them or uses them up. The spleen holds on to too many platelets. A combination of the above factors also may cause a low platelet count. The Bone Marrow Doesn't Make Enough Platelets Bone marrow is the sponge-like tissue inside the bones. It contains stem cells that develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. When stem cells are damaged, they don't grow into healthy blood cells. Many conditions and factors can damage stem cells. Cancer Cancer, such as leukemia (lu-KE-me-ah) or lymphoma (lim-FO-ma), can damage the bone marrow and destroy blood stem cells. Cancer treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy, also destroy the stem cells. Aplastic Anemia Aplastic anemia is a rare, serious blood disorder in which the bone marrow stops making enough new blood cells. This lowers the number of platelets in your blood. Toxic Chemicals Exposure to toxic chemicalssuch as pesticides, arsenic, and benzenecan slow the production of platelets. Medicines Some medicines, such as diuretics and chloramphenicol, can slow the production of platelets. Chloramphenicol (an antibiotic) rarely is used in the United States. Common over-the-counter medicines, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, also can affect platelets. Alcohol Alcohol also slows the production of platelets. A temporary drop in the platelet count is common among heavy drinkers, especially if they're eating foods that are low in iron, vitamin B12, or folate. Viruses Chickenpox, mumps, rubella, Epstein-Barr virus, or parvovirus can decrease your platelet count for a while. People who have AIDS often develop thrombocytopenia. Genetic Conditions Some genetic conditions can cause low numbers of platelets in the blood. Examples include Wiskott-Aldrich and May-Hegglin syndromes. The Body Destroys Its Own Platelets A low platelet count can occur even if the bone marrow makes enough platelets. The body may destroy its own platelets due to autoimmune diseases, certain medicines, infections, surgery, pregnancy, and some conditions that cause too much blood clotting. Autoimmune Diseases Autoimmune diseases occur if the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the body. If an autoimmune disease destroys the body's platelets, thrombocytopenia can occur. One example of this type of autoimmune disease is immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). ITP is a bleeding disorder in which the blood doesn't clot as it should. An autoimmune response is thought to cause most cases of ITP. Normally, your immune system helps your body fight off infections and diseases. But if you have ITP, your immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. Why this happens isn't known. (ITP also may occur if the immune system attacks your bone marrow, which makes platelets.) Other autoimmune diseases that destroy platelets include lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Medicines A reaction to medicine can confuse your body and cause it to destroy its platelets. Examples of medicines that may cause this to happen include quinine; antibiotics that contain sulfa; and some medicines for seizures, such as Dilantin, vancomycin, and rifampin. (Quinine is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products.) Heparin is a medicine commonly used to prevent blood clots. But an immune reaction may trigger the medicine to cause blood clots and thrombocytopenia. This condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT rarely occurs outside of a hospital. In HIT, the body's immune system attacks a substance formed by heparin and a protein on the surface of the platelets. This attack activates the platelets and they start to form blood clots. Blood clots can form deep in the legs (deep vein thrombosis), or they can break loose and travel to the lungs (pulmonary embolism). Infection A low platelet count can occur after blood poisoning from a widespread bacterial infection. A virus, such as mononucleosis or cytomegalovirus, also can cause a low platelet count. Surgery Platelets can be destroyed when they pass through man-made heart valves, blood vessel grafts, or machines and tubing used for blood transfusions or bypass surgery. Pregnancy About 5 percent of pregnant women develop mild thrombocytopenia when they're close to delivery. The exact cause isn't known for sure. Rare and Serious Conditions That Cause Blood Clots Some rare and serious conditions can cause a low platelet count. Two examples are thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). TTP is a rare blood condition. It causes blood clots to form in the body's small blood vessels, including vessels in the brains, kidneys, and heart. DIC is a rare complication of pregnancy, severe infections, or severe trauma. Tiny blood clots form suddenly throughout the body. In both conditions, the blood clots use up many of the blood's platelets. The Spleen Holds On to Too Many Platelets Usually, one-third of the body's platelets are held in the spleen. If the spleen is enlarged, it will hold on to too many platelets. This means that not enough platelets will circulate in the blood. An enlarged spleen often is due to cancer or severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis (sir-RO-sis). Cirrhosis is a disease in which the liver is scarred. This prevents it from working well. An enlarged spleen also might be due to a bone marrow condition, such as myelofibrosis (MI-eh-lo-fi-BRO-sis). With this condition, the bone marrow is scarred and isn't able to make blood cells."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Thrombocytopenia? ?","completion":"People who are at highest risk for thrombocytopenia are those affected by one of the conditions or factors discussed in \\"What Causes Thrombocytopenia?\\" This includes people who: Have certain types of cancer, aplastic anemia, or autoimmune diseases Are exposed to certain toxic chemicals Have a reaction to certain medicines Have certain viruses Have certain genetic conditions People at highest risk also include heavy alcohol drinkers and pregnant women."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Thrombocytopenia ?","completion":"Mild to serious bleeding causes the main signs and symptoms of thrombocytopenia. Bleeding can occur inside your body (internal bleeding) or underneath your skin or from the surface of your skin (external bleeding). Signs and symptoms can appear suddenly or over time. Mild thrombocytopenia often has no signs or symptoms. Many times, it's found during a routine blood test. Check with your doctor if you have any signs of bleeding. Severe thrombocytopenia can cause bleeding in almost any part of the body. Bleeding can lead to a medical emergency and should be treated right away. External bleeding usually is the first sign of a low platelet count. External bleeding may cause purpura (PURR-purr-ah) or petechiae (peh-TEE-key-ay). Purpura are purple, brown, and red bruises. This bruising may happen easily and often. Petechiae are small red or purple dots on your skin. Purpura and Petechiae Other signs of external bleeding include: Prolonged bleeding, even from minor cuts Bleeding or oozing from the mouth or nose, especially nosebleeds or bleeding from brushing your teeth Abnormal vaginal bleeding (especially heavy menstrual flow) A lot of bleeding after surgery or dental work also might suggest a bleeding problem. Heavy bleeding into the intestines or the brain (internal bleeding) is serious and can be fatal. Signs and symptoms include: Blood in the urine or stool or bleeding from the rectum. Blood in the stool can appear as red blood or as a dark, tarry color. (Taking iron supplements also can cause dark, tarry stools.) Headaches and other neurological symptoms. These problems are very rare, but you should discuss them with your doctor."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Thrombocytopenia ?","completion":"Your doctor will diagnose thrombocytopenia based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. A hematologist also may be involved in your care. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood diseases and conditions. Once thrombocytopenia is diagnosed, your doctor will begin looking for its cause. Medical History Your doctor may ask about factors that can affect your platelets, such as: The medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines and herbal remedies, and whether you drink beverages that contain quinine. Quinine is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products. Your general eating habits, including the amount of alcohol you normally drink. Your risk for AIDS, including questions about blood transfusions, sexual partners, intravenous (IV) drugs, and exposure to infectious blood or bodily fluids at work. Any family history of low platelet counts. Physical Exam Your doctor will do a physical exam to look for signs and symptoms of bleeding, such as bruises or spots on the skin. He or she will check your abdomen for signs of an enlarged spleen or liver. You also will be checked for signs of infection, such as a fever. Diagnostic Tests Your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests to help diagnose a low platelet count. For more information about blood tests, go to the Health Topics Blood Tests article. Complete Blood Count A complete blood count (CBC) measures the levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm. If you have thrombocytopenia, the results of this test will show that your platelet count is low. Blood Smear A blood smear is used to check the appearance of your platelets under a microscope. For this test, a small amount of blood is drawn from a blood vessel, usually in your arm. Bone Marrow Tests Bone marrow tests check whether your bone marrow is healthy. Blood cells, including platelets, are made in your bone marrow. The two bone marrow tests are aspiration (as-pih-RA-shun) and biopsy. Bone marrow aspiration might be done to find out why your bone marrow isn't making enough blood cells. For this test, your doctor removes a sample of fluid bone marrow through a needle. He or she examines the sample under a microscope to check for faulty cells. A bone marrow biopsy often is done right after an aspiration. For this test, your doctor removes a sample of bone marrow tissue through a needle. He or she examines the tissue to check the number and types of cells in the bone marrow. Other Tests If a bleeding problem is suspected, you may need other blood tests as well. For example, your doctor may recommend PT and PTT tests to see whether your blood is clotting properly. Your doctor also may suggest an ultrasound to check your spleen. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of your spleen. This will allow your doctor to see whether your spleen is enlarged."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Thrombocytopenia ?","completion":"Treatment for thrombocytopenia depends on its cause and severity. The main goal of treatment is to prevent death and disability caused by bleeding. If your condition is mild, you may not need treatment. A fully normal platelet count isn't necessary to prevent bleeding, even with severe cuts or accidents. Thrombocytopenia often improves when its underlying cause is treated. People who inherit the condition usually don't need treatment. If a reaction to a medicine is causing a low platelet count, your doctor may prescribe another medicine. Most people recover after the initial medicine has been stopped. For heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), stopping the heparin isn't enough. Often, you'll need another medicine to prevent blood clotting. If your immune system is causing a low platelet count, your doctor may prescribe medicines to suppress the immune system. Severe Thrombocytopenia If your thrombocytopenia is severe, your doctor may prescribe treatments such as medicines, blood or platelet transfusions, or splenectomy. Medicines Your doctor may prescribe corticosteroids, also called steroids for short. Steroids may slow platelet destruction. These medicines can be given through a vein or by mouth. One example of this type of medicine is prednisone. The steroids used to treat thrombocytopenia are different from illegal steroids taken by some athletes to enhance performance. Your doctor may prescribe immunoglobulins or medicines like rituximab to block your immune system. These medicines are given through a vein. He or she also may prescribe other medicines, such as eltrombopag or romiplostim, to help your body make more platelets. The former comes as a tablet to take by mouth and the latter is given as an injection under the skin. Blood or Platelet Transfusions Blood or platelet transfusions are used to treat people who have active bleeding or are at a high risk of bleeding. During this procedure, a needle is used to insert an intravenous (IV) line into one of your blood vessels. Through this line, you receive healthy blood or platelets. For more information about this procedure, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article. Splenectomy A splenectomy is surgery to remove the spleen. This surgery may be used if treatment with medicines doesn't work. This surgery mostly is used for adults who have immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).

Avoid medicines that you know have decreased your platelet count in the past. Be aware of medicines that may affect your platelets and raise your risk of bleeding. Two examples of such medicines are aspirin and ibuprofen. These medicines may thin your blood too much. Talk with your doctor about getting vaccinated for viruses that can affect your platelets.

Platelets are made in your bone marrow along with other kinds of blood cells. They stick together (clot) to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. Overview Without enough platelets, bleeding can occur inside the body (internal bleeding) or underneath or from the skin (external bleeding). People who have ITP often have purple bruises called purpura (PURR-purr-ah). These bruises appear on the skin or mucous membranes (for example, in the mouth). Bleeding from small blood vessels under the skin causes purpura. People who have ITP also may have bleeding that causes tiny red or purple dots on the skin. These pinpoint-sized dots are called petechiae (peh-TEE-kee-ay). Petechiae may look like a rash. Petechiae and Purpura People who have ITP also may have nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums during dental work, or other bleeding that's hard to stop. Women who have ITP may have menstrual bleeding that's heavier than normal. A lot of bleeding can cause hematomas (he-mah-TO-mas). A hematoma is a collection of clotted or partially clotted blood under the skin. It looks or feels like a lump. Bleeding in the brain as a result of ITP is very rare, but can be life threatening if it occurs. In most cases, an autoimmune response is thought to cause ITP. Normally, your immune system helps your body fight off infections and diseases. But if you have ITP, your immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. The reason why this happens isn't known. ITP can't be passed from one person to another. Types of Immune Thrombocytopenia The two types of ITP are acute (temporary or short-term) and chronic (long-lasting). Acute ITP generally lasts less than 6 months. It mainly occurs in childrenboth boys and girlsand is the most common type of ITP. Acute ITP often occurs after a viral infection. Chronic ITP lasts 6 months or longer and mostly affects adults. However, some teenagers and children do get this type of ITP. Chronic ITP affects women two to three times more often than men. Treatment depends on the severity of bleeding and the platelet count. In mild cases, treatment may not be needed. Outlook For most children and adults, ITP isn't a serious or life-threatening condition. Acute ITP in children often goes away on its own within a few weeks or months and doesn't return. In 80 percent of children who have ITP, the platelet count returns to normal within 6 to 12 months. Treatment may not be needed. For a small number of children, ITP doesn't go away on its own and may require further medical or surgical treatment. Chronic ITP varies from person to person and can last for many years. Even people who have severe forms of chronic ITP can live for decades.

Adults who have mild ITP may not need any treatment, other than watching their symptoms and platelet counts. Adults who have ITP with very low platelet counts or bleeding problems often are treated. The acute (short-term) type of ITP that occurs in children often goes away within a few weeks or months. Children who have bleeding symptoms, other than merely bruising (purpura), usually are treated. Children who have mild ITP may not need treatment other than monitoring and followup to make sure their platelet counts return to normal. Medicines Medicines often are used as the first course of treatment for both children and adults. Corticosteroids (cor-ti-co-STEER-roids), such as prednisone, are commonly used to treat ITP. These medicines, called steroids for short, help increase your platelet count. However, steroids have many side effects. Some people relapse (get worse) when treatment ends. The steroids used to treat ITP are different from the illegal steroids that some athletes take to enhance performance. Corticosteroids aren't habit-forming, even if you take them for many years. Other medicines also are used to raise the platelet count. Some are given through a needle inserted into a vein. These medicines include rituximab, immune globulin, and anti-Rh (D) immunoglobulin. Medicines also may be used with a procedure to remove the spleen called splenectomy (splee-NECK-tuh-mee). If medicines or splenectomy don't help, two newer medicineseltrombopag and romiplostimcan be used to treat ITP. Removal of the Spleen (Splenectomy) If needed, doctors can surgically remove the spleen. This organ is located in the upper left abdomen. The spleen is about the size of a golf ball in children and a baseball in adults. The spleen makes antibodies (proteins) that help fight infections. In ITP, these antibodies destroy platelets by mistake. If ITP hasn't responded to medicines, removing the spleen will reduce the destruction of platelets. However, it also may raise your risk for infections. Before you have the surgery, your doctor may give you vaccines to help prevent infections. If your spleen is removed, your doctor will explain what steps you can take to help avoid infections and what symptoms to watch for. Other Treatments Platelet Transfusions Some people who have ITP with severe bleeding may need to have platelet transfusions and be hospitalized. Some people will need platelet transfusions before having surgery. For a platelet transfusion, donor platelets from a blood bank are injected into the recipient's bloodstream. This increases the platelet count for a short time. For more information about platelet transfusions, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article. Treating Infections Some infections can briefly lower your platelet count. Treating the infection may help increase your platelet count and reduce bleeding problems.

During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. A heartbeat that is too fast is called tachycardia (TAK-ih-KAR-de-ah). A heartbeat that is too slow is called bradycardia (bray-de-KAR-de-ah). Most arrhythmias are harmless, but some can be serious or even life threatening. During an arrhythmia, the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body. Lack of blood flow can damage the brain, heart, and other organs. Understanding the Heart's Electrical System To understand arrhythmias, it helps to understand the heart's internal electrical system. The heart's electrical system controls the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat. With each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom. As the signal travels, it causes the heart to contract and pump blood. Each electrical signal begins in a group of cells called the sinus node or sinoatrial (SA) node. The SA node is located in the heart's upper right chamber, the right atrium (AY-tree-um). In a healthy adult heart at rest, the SA node fires off an electrical signal to begin a new heartbeat 60 to 100 times a minute. From the SA node, the electrical signal travels through special pathways in the right and left atria. This causes the atria to contract and pump blood into the heart's two lower chambers, the ventricles (VEN-trih-kuls). The electrical signal then moves down to a group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node, located between the atria and the ventricles. Here, the signal slows down just a little, allowing the ventricles time to finish filling with blood. The electrical signal then leaves the AV node and travels along a pathway called the bundle of His. This pathway divides into a right bundle branch and a left bundle branch. The signal goes down these branches to the ventricles, causing them to contract and pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body. The ventricles then relax, and the heartbeat process starts all over again in the SA node. (For more information about the heart's electrical system, including detailed animations, go to the Health Topics How the Heart Works article.) A problem with any part of this process can cause an arrhythmia. For example, in atrial fibrillation (A-tre-al fi-bri-LA-shun), a common type of arrhythmia, electrical signals travel through the atria in a fast and disorganized way. This causes the atria to quiver instead of contract. Outlook There are many types of arrhythmia. Most arrhythmias are harmless, but some are not. The outlook for a person who has an arrhythmia depends on the type and severity of the arrhythmia. Even serious arrhythmias often can be successfully treated. Most people who have arrhythmias are able to live normal, healthy lives."},{"prompt":"What causes Arrhythmia ?","completion":"An arrhythmia can occur if the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are delayed or blocked. This can happen if the special nerve cells that produce electrical signals don't work properly. It also can happen if the electrical signals don't travel normally through the heart. An arrhythmia also can occur if another part of the heart starts to produce electrical signals. This adds to the signals from the special nerve cells and disrupts the normal heartbeat. Smoking, heavy alcohol use, use of some drugs (such as cocaine or amphetamines), use of some prescription or over-the-counter medicines, or too much caffeine or nicotine can lead to arrhythmias in some people. Strong emotional stress or anger can make the heart work harder, raise blood pressure, and release stress hormones. Sometimes these reactions can lead to arrhythmias. A heart attack or other condition that damages the heart's electrical system also can cause arrhythmias. Examples of such conditions include high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, heart failure, an overactive or underactive thyroid gland (too much or too little thyroid hormone produced), and rheumatic heart disease. Congenital (kon-JEN-ih-tal) heart defects can cause some arrhythmias, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The term \\"congenital means the defect is present at birth. Sometimes the cause of arrhythmias is unknown."},{"prompt":"Who is at risk for Arrhythmia? ?","completion":"Arrhythmias are very common in older adults. Atrial fibrillation (a common type of arrhythmia that can cause problems) affects millions of people, and the number is rising. Most serious arrhythmias affect people older than 60. This is because older adults are more likely to have heart disease and other health problems that can lead to arrhythmias. Older adults also tend to be more sensitive to the side effects of medicines, some of which can cause arrhythmias. Some medicines used to treat arrhythmias can even cause arrhythmias as a side effect. Some types of arrhythmia happen more often in children and young adults. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), including Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, is more common in young people. PSVT is a fast heart rate that begins and ends suddenly. Major Risk Factors Arrhythmias are more common in people who have diseases or conditions that weaken the heart, such as: Heart attack Heart failure or cardiomyopathy, which weakens the heart and changes the way electrical signals move through the heart Heart tissue that's too thick or stiff or that hasn't formed normally Leaking or narrowed heart valves, which make the heart work too hard and can lead to heart failure Congenital heart defects (defects present at birth) that affect the heart's structure or function Other conditions also can raise the risk for arrhythmias, such as: High blood pressure Infections that damage the heart muscle or the sac around the heart Diabetes, which increases the risk of high blood pressure and coronary heart disease Sleep apnea, which can stress the heart because the heart doesn't get enough oxygen An overactive or underactive thyroid gland (too much or too little thyroid hormone in the body) Several other risk factors also can raise your risk for arrhythmias. Examples include heart surgery, certain drugs (such as cocaine or amphetamines), or an imbalance of chemicals or other substances (such as potassium) in the bloodstream."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Arrhythmia ?","completion":"Many arrhythmias cause no signs or symptoms. When signs or symptoms are present, the most common ones are: Palpitations (feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or fast) A slow heartbeat An irregular heartbeat Feeling pauses between heartbeats More serious signs and symptoms include: Anxiety Weakness, dizziness, and light-headedness Fainting or nearly fainting Sweating Shortness of breath Chest pain"},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Arrhythmia ?","completion":"Arrhythmias can be hard to diagnose, especially the types that only cause symptoms every once in a while. Doctors diagnose arrhythmias based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures. Specialists Involved Doctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases include: Cardiologists. These doctors diagnose and treat adults who have heart problems. Pediatric cardiologists. These doctors diagnose and treat babies, children, and youth who have heart problems. Electrophysiologists. These doctors are cardiologists or pediatric cardiologists who specialize in arrhythmias. Medical and Family Histories To diagnose an arrhythmia, your doctor may ask you to describe your symptoms. He or she may ask whether you feel fluttering in your chest and whether you feel dizzy or light-headed. Your doctor also may ask whether you have other health problems, such as a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems. He or she may ask about your family's medical history, including whether anyone in your family: Has a history of arrhythmias Has ever had heart disease or high blood pressure Has died suddenly Has other illnesses or health problems Your doctor will likely want to know what medicines you're taking, including over-the-counter medicines and supplements. Your doctor may ask about your health habits, such as physical activity, smoking, or using alcohol or drugs (for example, cocaine). He or she also may want to know whether you've had emotional stress or anger. Physical Exam During a physical exam, your doctor may: Listen to the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat Listen to your heart for a heart murmur (an extra or unusual sound heard during your heartbeat) Check your pulse to find out how fast your heart is beating Check for swelling in your legs or feet, which could be a sign of an enlarged heart or heart failure Look for signs of other diseases, such as thyroid disease, that could be causing the problem Diagnostic Tests and Procedures EKG (Electrocardiogram) An EKG is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. It's the most common test used to diagnose arrhythmias. An EKG shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). It also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through the heart. A standard EKG only records the heartbeat for a few seconds. It won't detect arrhythmias that don't happen during the test. To diagnose arrhythmias that come and go, your doctor may have you wear a portable EKG monitor. The two most common types of portable EKGs are Holter and event monitors. Holter and Event Monitors A Holter monitor records the heart's electrical signals for a full 24- or 48-hour period. You wear one while you do your normal daily activities. This allows the monitor to record your heart for a longer time than a standard EKG. An event monitor is similar to a Holter monitor. You wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities. However, an event monitor only records your heart's electrical activity at certain times while you're wearing it. For many event monitors, you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms. Other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms. Some event monitors are able to send data about your heart's electrical activity to a central monitoring station. Technicians at the station review the information and send it to your doctor. You also can use the device to report any symptoms you're having. You can wear an event monitor for weeks or until symptoms occur. Other Tests Other tests also are used to help diagnose arrhythmias. Blood tests. Blood tests check the level of substances in the blood, such as potassium and thyroid hormone. Abnormal levels of these substances can increase your chances of having an arrhythmia. Chest x ray. A chest x ray is a painless test that creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart and lungs. This test can show whether your heart is enlarged. Echocardiography. This test uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. Echocardiography (echo) provides information about the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working. The test also can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and previous injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow. There are several types of echo, including stress echo. This test is done both before and after a stress test (see below). A stress echo usually is done to find out whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart, a sign of coronary heart disease (CHD). A transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo, or TEE, is a special type of echo that takes pictures of the heart through the esophagus. The esophagus is the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach. Stress test. Some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast. During stress testing, you exercise to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests are done. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to make your heart work hard and beat fast. The heart tests done during stress testing may include nuclear heart scanning, echo, and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning of the heart. Electrophysiology study (EPS). This test is used to assess serious arrhythmias. During an EPS, a thin, flexible wire is passed through a vein in your groin (upper thigh) or arm to your heart. The wire records your heart's electrical signals. Your doctor can use the wire to electrically stimulate your heart and trigger an arrhythmia. This allows your doctor to see whether an antiarrhythmia medicine can stop the problem. Catheter ablation, a procedure used to treat some arrhythmias, may be done during an EPS. Tilt table testing. This test sometimes is used to help find the cause of fainting spells. You lie on a table that moves from a lying down to an upright position. The change in position may cause you to faint. Your doctor watches your symptoms, heart rate, EKG reading, and blood pressure throughout the test. He or she may give you medicine and then check your response to the medicine. Coronary angiography. Coronary angiography uses dye and special x rays to show the inside of your coronary arteries. To get the dye into your coronary arteries, your doctor will use a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun). A thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. The tube is threaded into your coronary arteries, and the dye is released into your bloodstream. Special x rays are taken while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your doctor study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels. This helps your doctor find blockages that can cause a heart attack. Implantable loop recorder. This device detects abnormal heart rhythms. Minor surgery is used to place this device under the skin in the chest area. An implantable loop recorder helps doctors figure out why a person may be having palpitations or fainting spells, especially if these symptoms don't happen very often. The device can be used for as long as 12 to 24 months."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Arrhythmia ?","completion":"Common arrhythmia treatments include medicines, medical procedures, and surgery. Your doctor may recommend treatment if your arrhythmia causes serious symptoms, such as dizziness, chest pain, or fainting. Your doctor also may recommend treatment if the arrhythmia increases your risk for problems such as heart failure, stroke, or sudden cardiac arrest. Medicines Medicines can slow down a heart that's beating too fast. They also can change an abnormal heart rhythm to a normal, steady rhythm. Medicines that do this are called antiarrhythmics. Some of the medicines used to slow a fast heart rate are beta blockers (such as metoprolol and atenolol), calcium channel blockers (such as diltiazem and verapamil), and digoxin (digitalis). These medicines often are used to treat atrial fibrillation (AF). Some of the medicines used to restore a normal heart rhythm are amiodarone, sotalol, flecainide, propafenone, dofetilide, ibutilide, quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide. These medicines often have side effects. Some side effects can make an arrhythmia worse or even cause a different kind of arrhythmia. Currently, no medicine can reliably speed up a slow heart rate. Abnormally slow heart rates are treated with pacemakers. People who have AF and some other arrhythmias may be treated with blood-thinning medicines. These medicines reduce the risk of blood clots forming. Warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran, heparin, and aspirin are examples of blood-thinning medicines. Medicines also can control an underlying medical condition that might be causing an arrhythmia, such as heart disease or a thyroid condition. Medical Procedures Some arrhythmias are treated with pacemakers. A pacemaker is a small device that's placed under the skin of your chest or abdomen to help control abnormal heart rhythms. Pacemakers have sensors that detect the heart's electrical activity. When the device senses an abnormal heart rhythm, it sends electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. Some arrhythmias are treated with a jolt of electricity to the heart. This type of treatment is called cardioversion or defibrillation, depending on which type of arrhythmia is being treated. Some people who are at risk for ventricular fibrillation are treated with a device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Like a pacemaker, an ICD is a small device that's placed under the skin in the chest. This device uses electrical pulses or shocks to help control life-threatening arrhythmias. An ICD continuously monitors the heartbeat. If it senses a dangerous ventricular arrhythmia, it sends an electric shock to the heart to restore a normal heartbeat. A procedure called catheter ablation is used to treat some arrhythmias if medicines don't work. During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. Then, the tube is guided to your heart. A special machine sends energy through the tube to your heart. The energy finds and destroys small areas of heart tissue where abnormal heart rhythms may start. Catheter ablation usually is done in a hospital as part of an electrophysiology study. Your doctor may recommend transesophageal echocardiography before catheter ablation to make sure no blood clots are present in the atria (the heart's upper chambers). Surgery Doctors treat some arrhythmias with surgery. This may occur if surgery is already being done for another reason, such as repair of a heart valve. One type of surgery for AF is called maze surgery. During this surgery, a surgeon makes small cuts or burns in the atria. These cuts or burns prevent the spread of disorganized electrical signals. If coronary heart disease is the cause of your arrhythmia, your doctor may recommend coronary artery bypass grafting. This surgery improves blood flow to the heart muscle. Other Treatments Vagal maneuvers are another type of treatment for arrhythmia. These simple exercises sometimes can stop or slow down certain types of supraventricular arrhythmias. They do this by affecting the vagus nerve, which helps control the heart rate. Some vagal maneuvers include: Gagging Holding your breath and bearing down (Valsalva maneuver) Immersing your face in ice-cold water Coughing Putting your fingers on your eyelids and pressing down gently Vagal maneuvers aren't an appropriate treatment for everyone. Discuss with your doctor whether vagal maneuvers are an option for you."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Childhood Interstitial Lung Disease ?","completion":"Childhood interstitial (in-ter-STISH-al) lung disease, or chILD, is a broad term for a group of rare lung diseases that can affect babies, children, and teens. These diseases have some similar symptoms, such as chronic cough, rapid breathing, and shortness of breath. These diseases also harm the lungs in similar ways. For example, they damage the tissues that surround the lungs' alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye; air sacs) and bronchial tubes (airways). Sometimes these diseases directly damage the air sacs and airways. The various types of chILD can decrease lung function, reduce blood oxygen levels, and disturb the breathing process. Overview Researchers have only begun to study, define, and understand chILD in the last decade. Currently, they don't know how many children have chILD. They also don't know how many children have each type of chILD. Diagnosing chILD and its specific diseases is hard because chILD is rare and complex. Also, chILD is a broad term for a group of diseases with similar symptomsit's not a precise diagnosis. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) also occurs in adults. However, the cause of ILD in adults may be different than the cause in children. Some types of chILD are similar to the adult forms of the disease. They may even have the same names as the adult forms, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis (noo-mo-NI-tis), immunodeficiency-associated lung disease, and bronchiolitis (brong-ke-o-LI-tis) obliterans. However, research shows that the course and outcomes of these diseases often are very different for children than for adults. Some ILDs only occur in children. They include: Lung growth abnormalities Neuroendocrine (noor-o-EN-do-krin) cell hyperplasia (hi-per-PLA-ze-ah) of infancy (NEHI) Pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (gli-ko-JEN-eh-sis) Developmental disorders, such as alveolar (al-VE-o-lar) capillary dysplasia Outlook Each form of chILD may differ in its severity and how it's treated. Thus, getting a correct diagnosis is vital for understanding and treating your child's illness. You may want to consult a pediatric pulmonologist. This is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating children who have lung diseases and conditions. This doctor's training and experience can help him or her diagnose chILD. The outlook for children who have chILD also depends on the specific type of disease they have. Some diseases are very severe and lead to early death. Others are chronic (long-term) diseases that parents and the child's medical team must work together to manage. At this time, chILD has no cure. However, some children who have certain diseases, such as NEHI, may slowly improve over time. Researchers are now starting to learn more about the causes of chILD. They're also trying to find distinct patterns and traits for the various forms of chILD. This information may help doctors better understand these diseases."},{"prompt":"What causes Childhood Interstitial Lung Disease ?","completion":"Researchers don't yet know all of the causes of childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD). Many times, these diseases have no clear cause. Some conditions and factors that may cause or lead to chILD include: Inherited conditions, such as surfactant disorders. Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps with breathing and may help protect the lungs from bacterial and viral infections. Birth defects that cause problems with the structure or function of the lungs. Aspiration (as-pih-RA-shun). This term refers to inhaling substancessuch as food, liquid, or vomitinto the lungs. Inhaling these substances can injure the lungs. Aspiration may occur in children who have swallowing problems or gastroesophageal (GAS-tro-eh-so-fa-JE-al) reflux disease (GERD). GERD occurs if acid from the stomach backs up into the throat. Immune system disorders. The immune system protects the body against bacteria, viruses, and toxins. Children who have immune system disorders aren't able to fight illness and disease as well as children who have healthy immune systems. Exposure to substances in the environment that can irritate the lungs, such as molds and chemicals. Some cancer treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy.

To diagnose chILD, doctors may first need to rule out other diseases as the cause of a child's symptoms. Early diagnosis of chILD may help doctors stop or even reverse lung function problems. Often though, doctors find chILD hard to diagnose because: There are many types of the disease and a range of underlying causes The disease's signs and symptoms are the same as those for many other diseases The disease may coexist with other diseases Going to a pediatric pulmonologist who has experience with chILD is helpful. A pediatric pulmonologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating children who have lung diseases and conditions. Medical and Family Histories Your child's medical history can help his or her doctor diagnose chILD. The doctor may ask whether your child: Has severe breathing problems that occur often. Has had severe lung infections. Had serious lung problems as a newborn. Has been exposed to possible lung irritants in the environment, such as birds, molds, dusts, or chemicals. Has ever had radiation or chemotherapy treatment. Has an autoimmune disease, certain birth defects, or other medical conditions. (Autoimmune diseases occur if the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the bodys tissues and cells.) The doctor also may ask how old your child was when symptoms began, and whether other family members have or have had severe lung diseases. If they have, your child may have an inherited form of chILD. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures No single test can diagnose the many types of chILD. Thus, your child's doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests. For some of these tests, infants and young children may be given medicine to help them relax or sleep. A chest x ray. This painless test creates pictures of the structures inside your child's chest, such as the heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can help rule out other lung diseases as the cause of your child's symptoms. A high-resolution CT scan (HRCT). An HRCT scan uses x rays to create detailed pictures of your child's lungs. This test can show the location, extent, and severity of lung disease. Lung function tests. These tests measure how much air your child can breathe in and out, how fast he or she can breathe air out, and how well your child's lungs deliver oxygen to the blood. Lung function tests can assess the severity of lung disease. Infants and young children may need to have these tests at a center that has special equipment for children. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BRONG-ko-al-VE-o-lar lah-VAHZH). For this procedure, the doctor injects a small amount of saline (salt water) through a tube inserted in the child's lungs. The fluid helps bring up cells from the tissues around the air sacs. The doctor can then look at these cells under a microscope. This procedure can help detect an infection, lung injury, bleeding, aspiration, or an airway problem. Various tests to rule out conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, acid reflux, heart disease, neuromuscular disease, and immune deficiency. Various tests for systemic diseases linked to chILD. Systemic diseases are diseases that involve many of the body's organs. Blood tests to check for inherited (genetic) diseases and disorders. If these tests don't provide enough information, your child's doctor may recommend a lung biopsy. A lung biopsy is the most reliable way to diagnose chILD and the specific disease involved. A lung biopsy is a surgical procedure that's done in a hospital. Before the biopsy, your child will receive medicine to make him or her sleep. During the biopsy, the doctor will take small samples of lung tissue from several places in your child's lungs. This often is done using video-assisted thoracoscopy (thor-ah-KOS-ko-pe). For this procedure, the doctor inserts a small tube with a light and camera (endoscope) into your child's chest through small cuts between the ribs. The endoscope provides a video image of the lungs and allows the doctor to collect tissue samples. After the biopsy, the doctor will look at these samples under a microscope."},{"prompt":"What are the treatments for Childhood Interstitial Lung Disease ?","completion":"Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) is rare, and little research has been done on how to treat it. At this time, chILD has no cure. However, some children who have certain diseases, such as neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy, may slowly improve over time. Current treatment approaches include supportive therapy, medicines, and, in the most serious cases, lung transplants. Supportive Therapy Supportive therapy refers to treatments that help relieve symptoms or improve quality of life. Supportive approaches used to relieve common chILD symptoms include: Oxygen therapy. If your child's blood oxygen level is low, he or she may need oxygen therapy. This treatment can improve breathing, support growth, and reduce strain on the heart. Bronchodilators. These medications relax the muscles around your childs airways, which helps open the airways and makes breathing easier. Breathing devices. Children who have severe disease may need ventilators or other devices to help them breathe easier. Extra nutrition. This treatment can help improve your child's growth and help him or her gain weight. Close monitoring of growth is especially important. Techniques and devices to help relieve lung congestion. These may include chest physical therapy (CPT) or wearing a vest that helps move mucus (a sticky substance) to the upper airways so it can be coughed up. CPT may involve pounding the chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen mucus in the lungs so that your child can cough it up. Supervised pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. Medicines Corticosteroids are a common treatment for many children who have chILD. These medicines help reduce lung inflammation. Other medicines can help treat specific types or causes of chILD. For example, antimicrobial medicines can treat a lung infection. Acid-blocking medicines can prevent acid reflux, which can lead to aspiration. Lung Transplant A lung transplant may be an option for children who have severe chILD if other treatments haven't worked. Currently, lung transplants are the only effective treatment for some types of chILD that have a high risk of death, such as alveolar capillary dysplasia and certain surfactant dysfunction mutations. Early diagnosis of these diseases gives children the chance to receive lung transplants. So far, chILD doesn't appear to come back in patients' transplanted lungs.

People who have a family history of inherited (genetic) interstitial lung disease may want to consider genetic counseling. A counselor can explain the risk of children inheriting chILD. You and your child can take steps to help prevent infections and other illnesses that worsen chILD and its symptoms. For example: Make hand washing a family habit to avoid germs and prevent illnesses. Try to keep your child away from people who are sick. Even a common cold can cause problems for someone who has chILD. Talk with your child's doctor about vaccines that your child needs, such as an annual flu shot. Make sure everyone in your household gets all of the vaccines that their doctors recommend. Talk with your child's doctor about how to prevent your child from getting respiratory syncytial (sin-SIT-e-al) virus. This common virus leads to cold and flu symptoms for most people. However, it can make children who have lung diseases very sick. Avoid exposing your child to air pollution, tobacco smoke, and other substances that can irritate his or her lungs. Strongly advise your child not to smoke now or in the future."},{"prompt":"What is (are) Von Willebrand Disease ?","completion":"Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a bleeding disorder. It affects your blood's ability to clot. If your blood doesn't clot, you can have heavy, hard-to-stop bleeding after an injury. The bleeding can damage your internal organs. Rarely, the bleeding may even cause death. In VWD, you either have low levels of a certain protein in your blood or the protein doesn't work well. The protein is called von Willebrand factor, and it helps your blood clot. Normally, when one of your blood vessels is injured, you start to bleed. Small blood cell fragments called platelets (PLATE-lets) clump together to plug the hole in the blood vessel and stop the bleeding. Von Willebrand factor acts like glue to help the platelets stick together and form a blood clot. Von Willebrand factor also carries clotting factor VIII (8), another important protein that helps your blood clot. Factor VIII is the protein that's missing or doesn't work well in people who have hemophilia, another bleeding disorder. VWD is more common and usually milder than hemophilia. In fact, VWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. It occurs in about 1 out of every 100 to 1,000 people. VWD affects both males and females, while hemophilia mainly affects males. Types of von Willebrand Disease The three major types of VWD are called type 1, type 2, and type 3. Type 1 People who have type 1 VWD have low levels of von Willebrand factor and may have low levels of factor VIII. Type 1 is the mildest and most common form of VWD. About 3 out of 4 people who have VWD have type 1. Type 2 In type 2 VWD, the von Willebrand factor doesn't work well. Type 2 is divided into subtypes: 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N. Different gene mutations (changes) cause each type, and each is treated differently. Thus, it's important to know the exact type of VWD that you have. Type 3 People who have type 3 VWD usually have no von Willebrand factor and low levels of factor VIII. Type 3 is the most serious form of VWD, but it's very rare. Overview Most people who have VWD have type 1, a mild form. This type usually doesn't cause life-threatening bleeding. You may need treatment only if you have surgery, tooth extraction, or trauma. Treatment includes medicines and medical therapies. Some people who have severe forms of VWD need emergency treatment to stop bleeding before it becomes life threatening. Early diagnosis is important. With the proper treatment plan, even people who have type 3 VWD can live normal, active lives."},{"prompt":"What causes Von Willebrand Disease ?","completion":"Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is almost always inherited. \\"Inherited\\" means that the disorder is passed from parents to children though genes.

Your symptoms may be different from your parents' symptoms. Some people have the genes for the disorder but don't have symptoms. However, they still can pass the genes on to their children. Some people get VWD later in life as a result of other medical conditions. This type of VWD is called acquired von Willebrand syndrome."},{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Von Willebrand Disease ?","completion":"The signs and symptoms of von Willebrand disease (VWD) depend on which type of the disorder you have. They also depend on how serious the disorder is. Many people have such mild symptoms that they don't know they have VWD.

These bleeding episodes can be fatal if not treated right away. People who have type 3 VWD also may have bleeding into soft tissues or joints, causing severe pain and swelling. Heavy menstrual bleeding often is the main symptom of VWD in women. Doctors call this menorrhagia (men-o-RA-je-ah). They define it as: Bleeding with clots larger than about 1-inch in diameter Anemia (low red blood cell count) or low blood iron The need to change pads or tampons more than every hour However, just because a woman has heavy menstrual bleeding doesn't mean she has VWD."},{"prompt":"w to diagnose Von Willebrand Disease ?","completion":"Early diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (VWD) is important to make sure that you're treated and can live a normal, active life. Sometimes VWD is hard to diagnose. People who have type 1 or type 2 VWD may not have major bleeding problems. Thus, they may not be diagnosed unless they have heavy bleeding after surgery or some other trauma. On the other hand, type 3 VWD can cause major bleeding problems during infancy and childhood. So, children who have type 3 VWD usually are diagnosed during their first year of life. To find out whether you have VWD, your doctor will review your medical history and the results from a physical exam and tests. Medical History Your doctor will likely ask questions about your medical history and your family's medical history. He or she may ask about: Any bleeding from a small wound that lasted more than 15 minutes or started up again within the first 7 days following the injury. Any prolonged, heavy, or repeated bleeding that required medical care after surgery or dental extractions. Any bruising with little or no apparent trauma, especially if you could feel a lump under the bruise. Any nosebleeds that occurred for no known reason and lasted more than 10 minutes despite pressure on the nose, or any nosebleeds that needed medical attention. Any blood in your stools for no known reason. Any heavy menstrual bleeding (for women). This bleeding usually involves clots or lasts longer than 7 to 10 days. Any history of muscle or joint bleeding. Any medicines you've taken that might cause bleeding or increase the risk of bleeding. Examples include aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), clopidogrel, warfarin, or heparin. Any history of liver or kidney disease, blood or bone marrow disease, or high or low blood platelet counts. Physical Exam Your doctor will do a physical exam to look for unusual bruising or other signs of recent bleeding. He or she also will look for signs of liver disease or anemia (a low red blood cell count). Diagnostic Tests No single test can diagnose VWD. Your doctor may recommend one or more blood tests to diagnose the disorder. These tests may include: Von Willebrand factor antigen. This test measures the amount of von Willebrand factor in your blood. Von Willebrand factor ristocetin (ris-to-SEE-tin) cofactor activity. This test shows how well your von Willebrand factor works. Factor VIII clotting activity. This test checks the clotting activity of factor VIII. Some people who have VWD have low levels of factor VIII activity, while others have normal levels. Von Willebrand factor multimers. This test is done if one or more of the first three tests are abnormal. It shows the structure of your von Willebrand factor.
