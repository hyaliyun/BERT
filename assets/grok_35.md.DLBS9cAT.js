For instance, if the incircle touches overline{BC} at X, overline{AB} at Y, and overline{AC} at Z, then overline{AX}, overline{BY}, and overline{CZ} are each split into two equal segments due to the properties of the angle bisectors and the incircle.

Let's analyze the steps in detail: 1. **Identifying the Criteria:** - The tens digit remains the same. - The hundreds digit and the units digit must be equal for the number to remain the same after swapping. 2. **Determining the Number of Valid Three-Digit Numbers:** - In a valid three-digit number, the hundreds and units digits must be the same. - There are 9 possible choices for the hundreds digit (1 through 9) because a three-digit number cannot start with zero. - There are 10 possible choices for the tens digit (0 through 9). - The units digit must be the same as the hundreds digit. Therefore, the total number of such three-digit numbers is: [ 9 times 10 = 90 ] 3. **Counting Numbers Divisible by 4:** - A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits (tens and ones place digits) is divisible by 4. - For a number of the form ( aba ) (where ( a ) is the hundreds and units digit, and ( b ) is the tens digit), we need the number ( 10b + a ) to be divisible by 4. - There are two main cases to consider based on ( a ): - **Case 1: ( a = 2 ) or ( a = 6 ):** - In these cases, ( 10b + 2 ) or ( 10b + 6 ) needs to be divisible by 4. - If ( a = 2 ): [ 10b + 2 equiv 2 pmod{4} rightarrow 2 equiv 2 pmod{4} ] Since the remainder is 2 when divided by 4, it cannot be divisible by 4. - If ( a = 6 ): [ 10b + 6 equiv 6 equiv 2 pmod{4} ] Similar to above, the remainder is 2 when divided by 4, it cannot be divisible by 4. - **Case 2: ( a = 4 ) or ( a = 8 ):** - If ( a = 4 ): [ 10b + 4 equiv 4 pmod{4} rightarrow 4 equiv 0 pmod{4} ] Here, the number is divisible by 4 regardless of ( b ), and there are 10 choices for ( b ). - If ( a = 8 ): [ 10b + 8 equiv 8 equiv 0 pmod{4} ] Similar to above, the number is divisible by 4 and there are 10 choices for ( b ). - Considering the above cases: - For ( a = 4): Total 10 valid numbers - For ( a = 8): Total 10 valid numbers Thus, the total number of such numbers that are divisible by 4 is: [ 10 + 10 = 20 ] # Conclusion: Thus, there are ( 20 ) three-digit numbers where the hundreds digit is equal to the units digit, and the number is divisible by ( 4 ).

So, after ( n ) rounds, the number of employees remaining would be ( 1000 times (0.9)^n ). The total number of employees laid off after ( n ) rounds would be the initial number of employees minus the remaining employees, which is ( 1000 - 1000 times (0.9)^n ). We are given that a total of 271 employees will be laid off, so we can set up the equation: [ 1000 - 1000 times (0.9)^n = 271 ] Solving for ( n ): [ 1000 times (1 - (0.9)^n) = 271 ] [ 1 - (0.9)^n = frac{271}{1000} ] [ (0.9)^n = 1 - frac{271}{1000} ] [ (0.9)^n = 1 - 0.271 ] [ (0.9)^n = 0.729 ] Now, we need to solve for ( n ). This is a logarithmic problem, and we can use the property of logarithms to solve for ( n ): [ log((0.9)^n) = log(0.729) ] [ n cdot log(0.9) = log(0.729) ] [ n = frac{log(0.729)}{log(0.9)} ] Using a calculator to find the logarithms: [ n approx frac{-0.1375}{-0.0458} ] [ n approx 3.001 ] Since the number of rounds of layoffs must be a whole number, and we cannot have a fraction of a round, we round up to the nearest whole number.

These integers represent the steps at which the path makes its vertical moves. 3. **Area Calculation:** The area under the path is a function of ( n ) minus the sum of the elements in ( X ). Specifically, if ( sum X ) is the sum of the elements in ( X ), then the area under the path modulo ( 2n-1 ) is given by: [ text{Area} equiv n - sum X pmod{2n-1} ] 4. **Equidistribution Property:** We need to show that the sums of random ( n )-element subsets of ( {0, 1, ldots, 2n-1} ) are equally likely modulo ( 2n-1 ). 5. **Type 1 and Type 2 Vectors:** - **Type 1 Vectors:** These are vectors where ( 2n-1 in X ). - **Type 2 Vectors:** These are vectors where ( 2n-1 notin X ). 6. **Equidistribution of Type 2 Vectors:** Consider the space of all Type 2 vectors. There are (frac{(2n-1)!}{(n-1)!}) such vectors. These vectors can be partitioned into collections of size ( 2n-1 ), where each collection differs by multiples of ( (1, 1, ldots, 1) ). Each multiple adds ( n ) to the sum modulo ( 2n-1 ). Since (gcd(n, 2n-1) = 1), each collection satisfies the equidistribution property. Thus, Type 2 vectors are equidistributed. 7. **Equidistribution of Type 1 Vectors:** For Type 1 vectors, we rely on the fact that (gcd(n-1, 2n-1) = 1). This ensures that the sums of these vectors are also equidistributed modulo ( 2n-1 ). 8. **Conclusion:** Since both Type 1 and Type 2 vectors are equidistributed, the sets ( S_k ) for each ( k ) contain an equal number of elements.

If the wholesaler offers an additional 5% discount on bulk purchases and the retailer sells these pens giving a discount of 4%, what is the profit%?","completion":"Let's assume the market price of each pen is 1 for simplicity. The retailer buys 120 pens for the price of 100 pens, so the cost for the retailer is 100. Since the wholesaler offers an additional 5% discount on bulk purchases, the retailer gets a further discount of 5% on the 100. The discount amount is: 5% of 100 = 0.05 * 100 = 5 So, the retailer actually pays: 100 - 5 = 95 for 120 pens. Now, the retailer sells these pens at a 4% discount on the market price. The market price for 120 pens would be: 120 pens * 1/pen = 120 The discount amount the retailer offers is: 4% of 120 = 0.04 * 120 = 4.8 So, the retailer sells the pens for: 120 - 4.8 = 115.2 The profit made by the retailer is the selling price minus the cost price: Profit = 115.2 - 95 = 20.2 To find the profit percentage, we use the formula: Profit% = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100 Profit% = (20.2 / 95) * 100 Profit% = 0.2126 * 100 Profit% = 21.26% Therefore, the retailer makes a profit of boxed{21.26%} ."},{"prompt":"Frank was reading through some books.

Drain rate: The bathtub takes 12 minutes to drain, so the drain rate is 1 tub/12 minutes or 1/12 tub per minute. Now, let's find the net fill rate when the drain is open: Net fill rate = Fill rate - Drain rate Net fill rate = (1/10) - (1/12) To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 60 (the least common multiple of 10 and 12): Net fill rate = (6/60) - (5/60) Net fill rate = 1/60 tub per minute Now that we have the net fill rate, we can find out how long it will take to fill the tub: Time to fill = 1 tub / Net fill rate Time to fill = 1 tub / (1/60) tub per minute Time to fill = 1 * (60/1) minutes Time to fill = 60 minutes So, it will take boxed{60} minutes to fill the bathtub with water if the drain stays open unnoticed."},{"prompt":"Brendan has entered an international kickboxing competition consisting of 5 rounds.

The area of the triangle formed by the line and the coordinate axes is given by frac{1}{2} times |xtext{-intercept}| times |ytext{-intercept}| = 6. Substituting the intercepts, we get frac{1}{2} times |b| times left|-frac{4}{3}bright| = 6. Simplifying this equation gives b^2 = 9, leading to b = pm 3. Thus, the equation of line l can be written as y = frac{3}{4}x pm 3, which in general form is 3x - 4y pm 12 = 0. **Step 2: Considering the condition of equal absolute intercepts and passing through (4,-3)** Let the intercepts on the x-axis and y-axis be a and b, respectively. The general equation of the line can be written as frac{x}{a} + frac{y}{b} = 1. Given that the line passes through (4, -3), substituting these values gives frac{4}{a} - frac{3}{b} = 1. Also, given that |a| = |b|, we have two cases to consider: a = b and a = -b. Solving the system of equations left{begin{array}{l}frac{4}{a} - frac{3}{b} = 1 a = pm bend{array}right., we find that the solutions are left{begin{array}{l}a = 1 b = 1end{array}right. and left{begin{array}{l}a = 7 b = -7end{array}right.. This leads to the equations of the line l as x + y - 1 = 0 and x - y - 7 = 0. **Step 3: Considering the case when a = b = 0** In this scenario, the equation of the line is y = kx. Since the line passes through the origin and (4, -3), substituting these values gives -3 = 4k, which simplifies to k = -frac{3}{4}. Therefore, the equation of the line in this case is y = -frac{3}{4}x. **Conclusion:** The possible equations of line l are x + y - 1 = 0, x - y - 7 = 0, and 3x + 4y = 0.

Given that we are dealing with six scores for each person, we can calculate the specific positions for the 50th and 80th percentiles as follows: For the 50th percentile of Xiao Zhang's scores: - Since there are 6 scores, the 50th percentile falls exactly between the 3rd and 4th scores when arranged in ascending order. - The formula to find the 50th percentile position is 6 times 50% = 3. - Therefore, the 50th percentile of Xiao Zhang's scores is the average of the 3rd and 4th scores, which is frac{39 + m}{2}. For the 80th percentile of Xiao Li's scores: - Similarly, to find the 80th percentile, we use the formula 6 times 80% = 4.8. This means the 80th percentile is closer to the 5th score but needs to be interpolated between the 4th and 5th scores. However, since we are dealing with discrete scores and the question implies a direct comparison, we consider the 80th percentile to effectively be the 5th score, which is 42. Given that the 50th percentile of Xiao Zhang's scores is equal to the 80th percentile of Xiao Li's scores, we set the two equal to each other: frac{39 + m}{2} = 42 Solving for m, we get: begin{align*} frac{39 + m}{2} &= 42 39 + m &= 84 m &= 84 - 39 m &= 45 end{align*} Therefore, the value of m is boxed{45}."},{"prompt":"A square and a triangle have equal perimeters.

This operation requires both numbers to be equal and will always act on the ( m )'s in pairs. - Since there are an odd number of ( m )'s, there will remain one ( m ) on which this reverse operation never acts, leading to a contradiction. 3. **Proof for even ( n )**: - Let ( n = 2m ). Treat the ( n )-tuple as an ( m )-tuple of pairs of elements of the ( n )-tuple, i.e., ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) = ((a_1, a_2), (a_3, a_4), ldots, (a_{2m-1}, a_{2m})) ). - Perform the operation on the two elements of each pair: ( b_i = (a_{2i-1} + a_{2i}, a_{2i-1} + a_{2i}) ). This transforms ( ((a_1, a_2), (a_3, a_4), ldots, (a_{2m-1}, a_{2m})) ) to ( (b_1, b_2, ldots, b_m) ). - From now on, the two elements of each pair will never be different. Suppose ( b_i = (a, a) ) and ( b_j = (b, b) ). The operation ( (b_i, b_j) to (b_i + b_j, b_i + b_j) ) is equivalent to ( ((a, a), (b, b)) to ((a+b, a+b), (a+b, a+b)) ). - We can multiply some ( b_i ) by 2 whenever we like, because ( (a, a) to (2a, 2a) ). At some point, we can multiply powers of 2 to some ( b_i )'s so that the largest power of 2 dividing ( b_i ) is the same for all ( b_i ). - Let ( o(x) ) denote the largest odd divisor of ( x ). If ( b_i neq b_j ) have the same largest power of 2, then ( o(b_i + b_j) < max(o(b_i), o(b_j)) ) because the sum of odd numbers is even. - Define ( l ) and ( s ) such that for all ( i ), ( o(b_l) geq o(b_i) geq o(b_s) ). The strategy to obtain all equal numbers is: - Operate pairs of the ( n )-tuple and make them equal to get it into ( (b_1, b_2, ldots, b_m) ) form. - Get all numbers into equal largest powers of 2. - Operate on ( (b_l, b_s) ). - Repeat the above steps until all numbers are equal. - After each \\"operate on ( (b_l, b_s) )\\" step, the largest odd number dividing at least one ( b_i ) decreases unless ( o(b_l) = o(b_s) ). This cannot decrease indefinitely, so after a finite number of steps, ( o(b_l) = o(b_s) ). - When ( o(b_l) = o(b_s) ), ( o(b_i) ) is the same for all ( i ). Then we can equate the largest power of 2 of all ( b_i ), resulting in all equal numbers. 4. **Example**: - Consider the sequence ( 3, 10, 7, 9, 4, 6 ): - ( 13, 13, 16, 16, 10, 10 ) - ( 26, 26, 16, 16, 20, 20 ) - Continue this process until all numbers are equal.

These are circles where each side of the triangle acts as the chord of the circle. 3. **Defining the Angle Condition**: For these circles, we ensure that all the inscribed angles subtended by the chords AC and BC are 45^circ. This follows from the property of the circle which states that the inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc. 4. **Intersection of Circles**: Let the center of these circles be O_{AC} and O_{BC}. We draw a line that passes through point C and is parallel to a line segment joining the centers O_{AC} and O_{BC}. This parallel line will intersect the two circles at points E and F. 5. **Forming the Desired Isosceles Right Triangle**: Now, connect points E and F to vertex A and B.

Similarly, let (P) and (Q) be the midpoints of sides (BC) and (DA) respectively. The segment (MN) connects the midpoints of two opposite sides, as does the segment (PQ). Step 3: Parallelism and Segment Length Equality The segments (MN) and (PQ) are both midsegments of the triangles formed by the diagonals of the quadrilateral. By the midpoint theorem in triangle geometry, each midsegment is parallel to the opposite side of the triangle and half its length. Since the midsegments are equal, [ MN = PQ ] These segments are parallel to the diagonals (AC) and (BD) respectively, thus making the quadrilateral formed by these midpoints a parallelogram. Step 4: Special Case of Equal Diagonals in Parallelogram Given the equal lengths of diagonals, the parallelogram (MNPQ) becomes a rectangle, because the diagonals of a rectangle are not only equal but also bisect each other.

This is because if (r) were a common root, then (f(r) + i = 0) and (f(r) + j = 0), which implies (i = j), a contradiction. 4. **Counting Roots:** Since each (f+k) has (n) roots and there are (m) such polynomials, the total number of roots (counting multiplicities) is (nm). 5. **Repeated Roots:** If there are repeated roots, they must be repeated within a single polynomial (f+k). Let (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_t) be the repeated roots of (prod_{k=1}^m (f+k)), where (x_j) has multiplicity (a_j). 6. **Derivative Condition:** The (k^{text{th}}) order root of (f+k) is the ((k-1)^{text{th}}) order root of (f'). Since (deg(f') = n-1), we have: [ (a_1 - 1) + (a_2 - 1) + cdots + (a_t - 1) leq n - 1 ] Simplifying, we get: [ a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_t leq n - 1 + t ] 7. **Minimum Number of Distinct Roots:** The number of distinct roots of (prod_{k=1}^m (f+k)) is: [ nm - (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_t) + t ] Using the inequality (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_t leq n - 1 + t), we get: [ nm - (n - 1 + t) + t = nm - n + 1 ] Therefore, the minimum number of distinct roots is: [ n(m-1) + 1 ] 8. **Equality Case:** Equality occurs when (f(x) = (x-1)^n - 1), which ensures that the roots are distributed in such a way that the minimum number of distinct roots is achieved. The final answer is (boxed{n(m-1) + 1})"},{"prompt":"The angle bisector Q K of triangle P Q R intersects its circumcircle at point M (distinct from Q).

Since all children can only sit in sections B and C, and there are 52 children, they will fill up section B first. Section B has 30 seats, so if all 52 children sat in section B, there would be: 52 children - 30 seats = 22 children left without seats in section B. Since section B is now full, the remaining 22 children will have to sit in section C.

Section B has 30 seats, and all of them are filled with children, so there are 0 empty seats in section B. Section C has 25 seats, and 22 children will occupy some of them, leaving 3 seats for adults or seniors. Since we have 4 adults or seniors left from section A, they will fill these 3 seats, and there will be 1 adult or senior without a seat.

This symmetry implies that B_1 and C_1 are reflections of B and C across the point O. 3.

Because of the equal radius of incircles in the problem's hypothesis, specifically r_{AOD} > r_{C_1OB_1} contradicts the earlier relationship.

Since the tax rate is 15% on this portion, we can calculate the tax as follows: Tax on first 40,000 = 15% of 40,000 Tax on first 40,000 = 0.15 * 40,000 Tax on first 40,000 = 6,000 Now, we know that the total tax paid is 8,000, and we've just calculated that 6,000 of that is from the first 40,000 of income. Therefore, the remaining tax paid must be from the income in excess of 40,000: Remaining tax = Total tax - Tax on first 40,000 Remaining tax = 8,000 - 6,000 Remaining tax = 2,000 This remaining tax of 2,000 is on the income in excess of 40,000, which in this case is 10,000 (50,000 - 40,000). To find the percentage of tax on this excess income, we can set up the following equation: Remaining tax = Percentage of tax on excess income * Excess income 2,000 = Percentage of tax on excess income * 10,000 Now, we solve for the percentage of tax on excess income: Percentage of tax on excess income = 2,000 / 10,000 Percentage of tax on excess income = 0.20 or 20% Therefore, the percentage of tax on the income in excess of 40,000 is boxed{20%} ."},{"prompt":"Given the focus of the parabola F(a,0) (a < 0), then the standard equation of the parabola is __( )__.

This plane beta will intersect the plane gamma in some line, which we will denote as BN'. Importantly, point N' will be on gamma. 4. The line BN' represents the intersecting line of planar surfaces gamma and beta, ensuring that it is parallel to a because beta is constructed parallel to a. 5. To locate point N', use the property of parallel lines and circles in plane gamma. Draw a circle in the plane gamma with radius d centered at point A. This circle will intersect line BN' at point N'. 6. Through point N', draw a line in plane beta parallel to a. This line necessarily intersects line b because beta contains b.

This translates to three edges being labeled 1 and one edge labeled 0 for each face. Step 1: Understanding the Cube's Geometry The cube has 6 faces and each face shares edges with four other faces. The challenge is to label each face so that each has exactly three edges labeled 1. Step 2: Counting Combinations Per Face For a single face, the number of ways to label three edges with 1 out of four total edges can be calculated by: [ binom{4}{3} = 4 ] However, unlike the situation where each face has two edges labeled 1, enforcing three labeled 1 per face greatly reduces the flexibility and consistent labeling across the cube. Step 3: Considering Adjacency and Ensuring Consistency Every edge belongs to two faces; thus, if an edge on one face is labeled 1, the same applies to the adjoining face. Labeling three edges on one face as 1 forces certain labels on adjacent faces. Due to double counting and shared edges, maintaining this pattern without overlap of four labeled edges is challenging. Analyzing a consistent labeling running through each face and checking for conflicts: - Choose any face and label three edges as 1, using one of four ways. - Move to an adjacent face sharing one of those three edges, ensuring again three edges must sum to 1, including the shared edge. Step 4: Conclusion and Verification Attempting to extend labeling to all faces while meeting the criteria across shared edges shows that there is a contradiction.

This is because the centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. Moreover, we know that the circumcenter is equidistant to all vertices of the triangle (( OA = OB = OC )). Since these segments ((frac{2}{3}) of the medians) are equal, it implies that all three medians are equal. In a triangle, the medians are equal if and only if the triangle is equilateral. Hence, triangle (ABC) is equilateral. 2. **Case 2: ( M ) coincides with ( I )** Suppose the centroid ( M ) coincides with the incenter ( I ). This implies that the median and the angle bisector from vertex ( A ) coincide. In this scenario, the median and the angle bisector being the same implies that ( AB = AC ), i.e., ( ABC ) is at least isosceles with ( AB = AC ).

For the quadratic equation (Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0) to have real roots, its discriminant must be non-negative. The discriminant (Delta) is given by: [ Delta = B^2 - 4AC ] 8.

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of dogs. The total number of long-furred or brown dogs is the sum of the number of long-furred dogs and the number of brown dogs, minus the number of dogs that are both long-furred and brown (since they are counted twice if we just add the two groups together): Number of long-furred or brown dogs = Number of long-furred dogs + Number of brown dogs - Number of long-furred brown dogs = 26 + 22 - 11 = 48 - 11 = 37 Now, we know that there are 8 dogs that are neither long-furred nor brown. These dogs are not included in the 37 dogs that are long-furred or brown. Therefore, the total number of dogs in the kennel (D) is the sum of the dogs that are long-furred or brown and the dogs that are neither: D = Number of long-furred or brown dogs + Number of dogs that are neither = 37 + 8 = 45 So, there are boxed{45} dogs in the kennel."},{"prompt":"Let a and b be positive numbers, and a+b=2.

This means that if the item is sold at a discount, the selling price becomes 5 times (1 - frac{x}{100}) yuan. 3. **Calculate the profit after discount**: The profit after applying the discount is then 5 times (1 - frac{x}{100}) - 4 yuan. 4. **Set the minimum profit condition**: The problem states that the profit margin must not be less than 10% of the cost price.

So the total number of corn cobs from the intact rows of corn is: 10 rows * 9 cobs/row = 90 cobs Since these 90 cobs are part of the 120 crops that are still intact, the remaining crops must be potatoes. So the number of intact potato crops is: 120 crops - 90 cobs = 30 potatoes Each row of potatoes should produce 30 potatoes, so the number of intact rows of potatoes is: 30 potatoes / 30 potatoes/row = 1 row However, this is only half of the original number of rows of potatoes, because half of the crops were destroyed.

Since ( a, b, c ) are roots of ( x^3 + 3x^2 + 5x + 7 = 0 ), we have: [ a^3 + 3a^2 + 5a + 7 = 0, quad b^3 + 3b^2 + 5b + 7 = 0, quad c^3 + 3c^2 + 5c + 7 = 0 ] 8. Therefore, the polynomial simplifies to: [ P(a) = k cdot 0 + (Aa^2 + Ba + C) = b + c ] [ P(b) = k cdot 0 + (Ab^2 + Bb + C) = c + a ] [ P(c) = k cdot 0 + (Ac^2 + Bc + C) = a + b ] 9. This implies: [ Aa^2 + Ba + C = b + c ] [ Ab^2 + Bb + C = c + a ] [ Ac^2 + Bc + C = a + b ] 10. We also know ( P(-3) = -16 ): [ P(-3) = k((-3)^3 + 3(-3)^2 + 5(-3) + 7) + (A(-3)^2 + B(-3) + C) = -16 ] [ P(-3) = k(-27 + 27 - 15 + 7) + (9A - 3B + C) = -16 ] [ P(-3) = k(-8) + (9A - 3B + C) = -16 ] 11. Solving for ( k ): [ -8k + 9A - 3B + C = -16 ] 12. To find ( P(0) ), we substitute ( x = 0 ) into the polynomial: [ P(0) = k(0^3 + 3 cdot 0^2 + 5 cdot 0 + 7) + (A cdot 0^2 + B cdot 0 + C) ] [ P(0) = 7k + C ] 13. From the previous steps, we know ( k = 2 ): [ P(0) = 7 cdot 2 + C = 14 + C ] 14. Using the condition ( P(-3) = -16 ): [ -8 cdot 2 + 9A - 3B + C = -16 ] [ -16 + 9A - 3B + C = -16 ] [ 9A - 3B + C = 0 ] 15.

Thus, ( a_n, a_{n+1}, cdots, a_{n+m-1} ) forms a good segment. 3. Repeat the above process starting from ( n+m ).

Show that the robber can avoid capture for at least 10000 moves, but that the policeman can ultimately capture the robber.","completion":"1. **Board Configuration and Initial Setup**: - The game is played on a (2001 times 2001) board. - The policeman (P) starts at the central square ((1001,1001)). - The robber (R) starts one square diagonally northeast of the policeman at ((1002,1002)). 2. **Square Coloration**: - Color the board using three colors in a repeating pattern: [ begin{array}{ccc} 0 & 1 & 2 1 & 2 & 0 2 & 0 & 1 end{array} ] - Both P and R start on squares with color 2. 3. **Modulus and Move Analysis**: - Any move by either piece changes their color by (+1) modulo 3. - However, P has a special move that changes his color directly from 1 to 0. - Initially, P's color is always (1) more than R's color modulo 3 after each move. - Even after P uses his special move, his color changes to (0) while R's color changes to (1). Hence, P's color will be (1) less than R's color modulo 3. 4. **Policeman's Moves and Strategy**: - It takes P at least 2001 moves to execute his special move once: [ 2001 + 3999 = 6000 text{ moves} ] - Therefore, R can avoid capture for at least 10000 moves by utilizing moves ((text{NW, S, E})). 5. **Optimal Strategy for Capture**: - Policeman can ultimately capture the robber by reducing the Manhattan distance (d): - Define (d = text{number of rows} + text{number of columns}) separating P and R. - Policeman follows R closely and tries to position himself into one of the following configurations relative to R: [ begin{array}{ccc} x & P & x x & x & P x & x & x x & x & x x & R & x end{array} ] 6. **Special Configurations**: - The positions where P can definitely capture R: [ begin{array}{ccccc} x & P & x && x & x & x x & x & P > rightarrow & rightarrow && x & x & x x & x & x && x & P & x x & x & x && x & x & x x & R & x && x & R & x end{array} ] - Policeman sustains the strategy where he mirrors R's moves while maintaining close proximity until R is restricted near the borders. 7. **Termination of Strategy**: - The robber is forced to move either east or south repeatedly due to the board's constraints. - Eventually, P will capture R since the board edge dynamics force the robber into a corner. # Conclusion: - The robber can avoid capture for at least (10000) moves by employing strategic moves. - However, the policeman can ultimately guarantee capture by correctly reducing the distance and forcing the robber to the board's edges.

For each of the V vertices, exactly T triangular faces and P pentagonal faces meet. Determine the value of P + T + V. 1. **Identify basic properties using the given data:** Given: - The polyhedron has F = 32 faces. 2. **Use Euler's formula:** Euler's formula relates the number of faces (F), vertices (V), and edges (E) of a polyhedron: [ V - E + F = 2 ] Substituting F = 32 into Euler's formula gives: [ V - E + 32 = 2 implies V - E = -30 implies V + 30 = E ] 3. **Understand edge and vertex relationships:** Each vertex is shared by T triangular faces and P pentagonal faces. Each triangular face contributes 3 edges and each pentagonal face contributes 5 edges. Since each edge belongs to two faces, the total number of edges E can also be calculated by: [ E = frac{3T + 5P}{2} ] 4. **Relate edges with the number of faces and vertices:** Using the above derivation and the polyhedron's properties: [ 2E = V(T + P) ] Therefore, substituting E = V + 30: [ V(T + P) = 2(V + 30) implies V(T + P - 2) = 60 ] 5. **Relate edges and vertices with faces:** The total number of triangular faces frac{VT}{3} and pentagonal faces frac{VP}{5} must equal the number of faces of the polyhedron, 32: [ frac{VT}{3} + frac{VP}{5} = 32 ] Multiplying through by 15 to clear the denominators gives: [ 5VT + 3VP = 480 ] 6. **Simplify and solve the equations:** From the previous step, combining the equations derived we get: [ 3VT + 5VP = 480 ] Dividing both sides by V: [ 3T + 5P = 16 ] Given that T and P are non-negative integers, the only non-negative integer solutions for 3T + 5P = 16 are T = 2 and P = 2. 7. **Determine the number of vertices:** Substitute T = 2 and P = 2 into V(T + P - 2) = 60: [ V(2 + 2 - 2) = 60 implies V times 2 = 60 implies V = 30 ] 8. **Conclude the computation:** Sum P + T + V: [ P + T + V = 2 + 2 + 30 = 34 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{34} ]"},{"prompt":"A triangle with vertices at ((2, 3)), ((4, 1)), and ((7, 0)) is reflected about the yaxis.

Here are the detailed steps: 1. **Define the variables:** Let ( x = a^2 + 2bc ), ( y = b^2 + 2ca ), and ( z = c^2 + 2ab ). The inequality then becomes: [ f(x) + f(y) + f(z) leq f(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 2f(ab + bc + ca). ] 2. **Assume constants:** Assume that ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ) and ( ab + bc + ca ) are constants.

This means: [ a^2 + 2bc = b^2 + 2ca leq c^2 + 2ab. ] 5. **Solve for equal variables:** From ( a^2 + 2bc = b^2 + 2ca ), we get ( a = b ) or ( a + b = 2c ). If ( a + b = 2c ), the condition ( b^2 + 2ca leq c^2 + 2ab ) is equivalent to ( (b - c)^2 leq 0 ), which implies ( b = c ). 6. **Conclusion:** Thus, it suffices to prove the requested inequality for two equal variables.

We do this in two steps: first, by finding the total number of ways to choose two members from the club, and second, by finding the number of ways to choose two girls. 1. **Total Ways to Choose Two Members**: The club has 10 members in total. The number of ways to choose two members out of these 10, without regard to order, is given by the combination formula binom{n}{k} = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. Here, n=10 and k=2, so we have: [ binom{10}{2} = frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = frac{10 times 9}{2 times 1} = 45 ] This means there are 45 different ways to choose any two members from the club. 2. **Ways to Choose Two Girls**: There are 5 girls in the club. Similarly, the number of ways to choose two girls out of these 5 is given by the combination formula with n=5 and k=2: [ binom{5}{2} = frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10 ] This means there are 10 different ways to choose two girls from the club. 3. **Calculating the Probability**: The probability that the two members chosen at random are both girls is the ratio of the number of ways to choose two girls to the total number of ways to choose any two members. This can be calculated as follows: [ text{Probability} = frac{text{Ways to Choose Two Girls}}{text{Total Ways to Choose Two Members}} = frac{10}{45} ] Simplifying this fraction gives us: [ text{Probability} = frac{10}{45} = frac{2}{9} ] Therefore, the probability that two members chosen at random from the club are both girls is boxed{frac{2}{9}}."},{"prompt":"w many perfect square factors does 360 have?","completion":"First, we find the prime factorization of 360.

To find the perfect square factors of 360, we consider the exponents for each prime factor: - For 2, possible even exponents are 0 and 2. - For 3, possible even exponents are 0 and 2 (since 2 is the highest even number ≤ the exponent of 3 in the factorization). - For 5, the only even exponent is 0 (since the exponent of 5 in the factorization is 1).

So, the amount of bananas he could get for Rs. 150 at the reduced price is 120 more than what he could get at the original price. Let's calculate the number of bananas he could get at the original price with Rs. 150: Number of bananas at original price = Rs. 150 / P With the reduced price, he gets 120 more bananas: Number of bananas at reduced price = (Rs. 150 / 0.4P) + 120 But we know that the number of bananas at the reduced price is equal to the number of bananas at the original price plus 120: Rs. 150 / 0.4P = Rs. 150 / P + 120 Now, let's solve for P: 150 / 0.4P = 150 / P + 120 Multiply both sides by 0.4P to get rid of the denominator: 150 = 0.4 * 150 / P + 0.4 * 120 150 = 60 / P + 48 Subtract 48 from both sides: 150 - 48 = 60 / P 102 = 60 / P Now, multiply both sides by P and divide by 102 to solve for P: P = 60 / 102 P = 60 / 102 P = 10 / 17 So, the original price per banana is Rs. 10/17.

The perpendicular distance d from the center of the circle to the line l is given by the formula for the distance of a point to a line: d = frac{|0 - 0 + 2|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}. Knowing that the length of the chord AB of the circle that is perpendicular to the radius vector passing through the midpoint of the chord is AB = 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2}, and given that AB = 2sqrt{2}, we substitute d=sqrt{2} and solve for r: 2sqrt{2} = 2sqrt{r^2 - (sqrt{2})^2}, sqrt{2} = sqrt{r^2 - 2}, 2 = r^2 - 2, r^2 = 4, r = 2; quad text{(since } r > 0 text{)}.

This can be done due to the properties of reflection in geometry. - Reflecting X over A gives a new point X' such that overrightarrow{AX'} = -overrightarrow{AX}. - Reflecting X' over B moves it to a point X'' such that overrightarrow{BX''} = -overrightarrow{BX'}. - Combining both reflections, the movement of X to X'' can be expressed as the vector 2overrightarrow{AB}. 3. Now, select three chips A, B, and C that do not lie on a single straight line. By applying translations by the vectors 2overline{AB}, 2overline{AC}, and 2overrightarrow{BC}, any chip can be moved inside a larger circle of fixed radius R. 4. We now consider a convex (n-2)-gon (polygon with n-2 vertices), one of whose vertices is at point A and whose angle at vertex A lies within the angle angle BAC formed by the chips A, B, and C. 5. Construct smaller circles centered at each vertex of this (n-2)-gon, ensuring that each vertex of the (n-2)-gon can be replaced by any point within the corresponding small circle, while preserving the polygon's convexity. 6. Next, examine the homothety centered at point A that transforms each small circle such that the resulting larger circles have a radius greater than R. If B and C's positions are added to this configuration, the transformed (n-2)-gon can generate a convex n-gon. 7. By relocating all chips (except B and C) within the corresponding larger circles so that each larger circle contains only one chip, we ensure that the chips are placed at the vertices of a convex n-gon. 8. Therefore, we have demonstrated that through a series of operations, it's possible to rearrange the chips so that they lie at the vertices of some convex polygon.

In any triangle, the angles opposite the sides satisfy the property that the larger the side, the larger the opposite angle. Therefore: [ angle ABC > angle BAC = 75^circ ] 6. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is ( 180^circ ), we have: [ angle BCA = 180^circ - angle BAC - angle ABC ] Due to our assumption that ( angle ABC > 75^circ ), it follows that: [ angle BCA < 180^circ - 75^circ - 75^circ = 30^circ ] 7. The altitude ( BN ) being half the length of ( AC ) implies: [ BN = frac{1}{2}AC ] 8.

Similarly, let us now consider the opposite case where ( BC > AC ). If we apply the same logic: (angle BAC = 75^circ) and knowing that in any triangle the greater angle is opposite the longer side, we would get: [ angle ABC < angle BAC = 75^circ ] Since [ angle ABC + angle BCA + angle BAC = 180^circ ] This implies: [ angle BCA = 180^circ - 75^circ - angle ABC ] leading to: [ angle BCA < 30^circ ] Again, letting ( BN ) be the altitude: [ BN = frac{1}{2}AC ] Again ( B N ) would have to satisfy: [ BN < frac{1}{2}AC ] This also contradicts the given condition ( BN = frac{1}{2}AC ). 10.

Since Lao sells each chicken for 1.50, and the cost of feed per chicken is 0.20, the profit per chicken is: Profit per chicken = Selling price - Cost of feed Profit per chicken = 1.50 - 0.20 = 1.30 Lao made a total profit of 65.

Let ( x ) be the smallest positive element in ( F ). - We can write ( x = y + z ) for ( y, z in F ). Since ( x ) is the smallest, and ( F ) contains only positive elements, ( y, z ) must be positive and thus smaller than ( x ). This is a contradiction. - Therefore, ( F ) must contain negative elements and by similar reasoning, ( F ) must also contain positive elements. 4. **Listing Positive Elements**: - Pick any positive element ( x_1 ) in ( F ). - Assume we have selected distinct positive elements ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k ) from ( F ). - Since for each ( x_k ), we have ( x_k = y + z ) with ( y, z in F ) and since at least one of ( y ) or ( z ) must be positive, let ( y ) be positive. - Let ( y ) be labeled as ( x_{k+1} ).

This process continues with ( A ) and ( B ) deducing progressively more refined intervals for ( a ) and ( b ). We denote these intervals for ( a ) and ( b ) as ([r_{n-1}, s_{n-1}]) at step ( n ). 6. In the ( n )-th step, assume ( A ) knows ( r_{n-1} le b le s_{n-1} ). If ( b ) were greater than ( x - r_{n-1} ), ( B ) could deduce ( a + b = y ) because ( a + b ) exceeding ( x ) forces the conclusion. Conversely, if ( b ) were less than ( y - s_{n-1} ), ( B ) could deduce ( a + b = x ). But, since ( B ) says “no”, it must be the case that ( y - s_{n-1} le b le x - r_{n-1} ). 7. Therefore, set ( r_{n} = y - s_{n-1} ) and ( s_{n} = x - r_{n-1} ). 8. Similarly, in the next step, ( B ) knows from ( A )'s \\"no\\" answer that ( r_{n} le b le s_{n} ), further reducing the range. 9. The update rule shows that the size of the intervals ( s_{i} - r_{i} ) decreases geometrically: specifically, each step the interval ( s_{i+1} - r_{i+1} = s_{i} - r_{i} - (y - x) ). 10. Since ( y - x > 0 ), after finitely many steps, say ( m ), we will eventually have ( s_{m} - r_{m} < 0 ). This implies a contradiction because it signifies a negative interval length, which is impossible. 11. Hence, within a finite number of steps, one of the students will have successfully deduced the opponent’s number and answered \\"yes.\\" [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Compute (cos 105^circ.)","completion":"Using the angle addition formula, ( cos(a + b) = cos a cos b - sin a sin b ), we can express (105^circ) as (60^circ + 45^circ) to compute (cos 105^circ): [ cos 105^circ = cos (60^circ + 45^circ) = cos 60^circ cos 45^circ - sin 60^circ sin 45^circ ] Use the known values of cosine and sine: [ cos 60^circ = frac{1}{2}, quad cos 45^circ = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, quad sin 60^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, quad sin 45^circ = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ] Now substitute these into the formula: [ cos 105^circ = left(frac{1}{2} cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right) - left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right) = frac{sqrt{2}}{4} - frac{sqrt{6}}{4} = frac{sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}}{4} ] [ boxed{frac{sqrt{2} - sqrt{6}}{4}} ] Conclusion: The result is calculated correctly, preserving the original method's integrity while applying it to a different problem.

By manipulating graphically or algebraically, (c, d) and (d, c) lie on the graph of y = g(x) and are swapped when considering x = g(y). This function has zero crossings and maximas/minimas more frequently due to the higher frequency 2pi. For interval [-1, 1], the function sin(2pi x) has zeros at x = k/2 for k integers. This results in zeros at x = -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1. Each zero of g(x) = 0 will have one solution to g(x) = c.

Given these distributions, we can calculate the number of ways to arrange the letters in each section: 1. For the first four letters, which include k+1 Cs and the rest being Bs, the number of arrangements is given by the combination formula {4 choose k+1}. 2. For the middle five letters, with k As, (5-k) Cs, and the rest being Bs, the arrangements can be calculated as {5 choose k}. 3. For the last six letters, containing 4-k As and the rest being Bs, the number of arrangements is {6 choose 4-k}. This can also be written as {6 choose k+2} due to the properties of combinations. Since k=4 leads to a contradiction (as it would imply a negative number of As in the last six letters), we sum over the valid values of k from 0 to 3: [ sum_{k=0}^{3} {4choose k+1}{5choose k}{6choose k+2} = {4choose 1}{5choose 0}{6choose 2} + {4choose 2}{5choose 1}{6choose 3} + {4choose 3}{5choose 2}{6choose 4} + {4choose 4}{5choose 3}{6choose 5} ] Calculating each term: - For k=0: {4choose 1}{5choose 0}{6choose 2} = 4 cdot 1 cdot 15 = 60 - For k=1: {4choose 2}{5choose 1}{6choose 3} = 6 cdot 5 cdot 20 = 600 - For k=2: {4choose 3}{5choose 2}{6choose 4} = 4 cdot 10 cdot 15 = 600 - For k=3: {4choose 4}{5choose 3}{6choose 5} = 1 cdot 10 cdot 6 = 60 Adding these together gives 60 + 600 + 600 + 60 = 1320.

Since A I perp EF and A I is the diameter of the circle passing through points A, F, E, and I, the area {S}_{text{quadrilateral } A F I E} can be written as: [ S_{text{quadrilateral } A F I E} = frac{1}{2} A I cdot E F = frac{1}{2} A I^2 sin A ] 3. **Summing Area Relations:** Similarly, we can write the area for other segments formed: [ S_{triangle A B C} = S_{A F I E} + S_{F I D B} + S_{I D C E} ] Normalizing these areas by the entire area S_{triangle ABC}: [ 1 = frac{S_{A F I E}}{S_{triangle ABC}} + frac{S_{F I D B}}{S_{triangle ABC}} + frac{S_{I D C E}}{S_{triangle ABC}} ] Which gives us: [ 1 = frac{A I^2}{bc} + frac{B I^2}{ac} + frac{C I^2}{ab} ] 4. **Geometric Mean Inequality:** From the geometric mean inequality applied here, we have: [ frac{A I cdot B I cdot C I}{abc} leq frac{1}{3sqrt{3}} ] 5. **Substituting Known Values:** Knowing that A I = frac{r}{sin frac{A}{2}}, a = 2R sin A, and using the identity sin frac{A}{2} sin frac{B}{2} sin frac{C}{2} = frac{r}{4R}, we substitute these into our expression: [ frac{1}{3sqrt{3}} geq frac{A I cdot B I cdot C I}{abc} = frac{r^3}{sin frac{A}{2} sin frac{B}{2} sin frac{C}{2}} cdot frac{1}{8R^3 sin A sin B sin C} ] Simplifying the expression, we get: [ sin A sin B sin C geq frac{3 sqrt{3} r^2}{2 R^2} ] 6. **Upper Bound Validation:** For the upper bound, similarly, we use trigonometric identities and known inequalities to show: [ sin A sin B sin C leq frac{3 sqrt{3} r}{4 R} leq frac{3 sqrt{3}}{8} ] These conclusions satisfy the given inequalities in the problem statement. # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{3 sqrt{3} r^{2}}{2 R^{2}} leqslant sin A sin B sin C leqslant frac{3 sqrt{3} r}{4 R} leqslant frac{3 sqrt{3}}{8}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a and b are two perfect squares, the unit digit of a is 1, and its tens digit is x; the unit digit of b is 6, and its tens digit is y.

This allows us to segment the journey around entering and exiting the central hexagon. 4. **Route Calculation**: - Since there are six unshaded hexagons forming the outer ring, and she needs to enter and then exit the central hexagon as part of her path: - The entry into the central hexagon can occur from any one of the six positions in the outer ring. - However, one hexagon must be reserved as the “final destination” before reaching ( mathrm{Y} ), limiting valid entry points to five of these outer ring hexagons (excluding the one just before the final hexagon and ( mathrm{Y} )). 5. **Different Routes Consideration**: - For each of the five entry points into the central hexagon, there exists a valid, unique route since the journey must continue through each unshaded hexagon exactly once. 6. **Conclusion**: - By analyzing the above conditions and constraints, we can determine that there are **5** unique routes the ladybird can take from ( mathrm{X} ) to ( mathrm{Y} ).

The derivative of f(x), denoted as f'(x), is calculated as follows: [ f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}[(x^{2}+ax+b)e^{-x}] = (2x+a)e^{-x} - (x^{2}+ax+b)e^{-x} cdot frac{d}{dx}(-x) ] [ = (2x+a)e^{-x} - (x^{2}+ax+b)e^{-x} = [-x^{2} + (2-a)x + a - b]e^{-x} ] At the point (0, f(0)), we have f'(0) = a - b because when x=0, the expression simplifies to a-b. Also, f(0) = b because the x^{2} and ax terms vanish, leaving us with be^{-0} = b. The equation of the tangent line at (0, f(0)) is given as y - f(0) = f'(0)(x - 0), which simplifies to y - b = (a - b)x. This can be rearranged to (a-b)x - y + b = 0.

Without loss of generality, assume (a ge b ge c). 3. First, consider the case where (a le 2bc).

For these two expressions to be equal, their corresponding terms must be equal. Focusing on the linear terms, we equate 4bx from the expansion to 14x from the given expression: begin{align*} 4bx &= 14x b &= frac{14}{4} b &= frac{7}{2}. end{align*} Now that we have determined b = frac{7}{2}, we can find the constant term of the squared binomial: begin{align*} left(2x + frac{7}{2}right)^2 &= 4x^2 + 14x + left(frac{7}{2}right)^2 &= 4x^2 + 14x + frac{49}{4}. end{align*} Therefore, comparing this to the original expression 4x^2 + 14x + a, we see that a = frac{49}{4}.

What is the capacity of the tank (in litres)?","completion":"Let's denote the capacity of the tank as C (in litres). The outlet pipe empties the tank in 5 hours. Therefore, the rate at which the outlet pipe empties the tank is C/5 litres per hour. When the inlet pipe is open, it lets water in at a rate of 8 litres per minute, which is 8 * 60 = 480 litres per hour. With the inlet pipe open, the outlet pipe takes 5 + 3 = 8 hours to empty the tank. The effective rate at which the tank is being emptied when both pipes are open is the rate of the outlet pipe minus the rate of the inlet pipe. This effective rate should equal the capacity of the tank divided by the time it takes to empty it with both pipes open, which is 8 hours. So, we have: (C/5) - 480 = C/8 Multiplying both sides by 40 (the least common multiple of 5 and 8) to eliminate the fractions, we get: 8C - (40 * 480) = 5C 8C - 19200 = 5C Subtracting 5C from both sides, we get: 3C = 19200 Dividing both sides by 3, we get: C = 19200 / 3 C = 6400 Therefore, the capacity of the tank is boxed{6400} litres."},{"prompt":"amount at compound interest sums to rs . 17640 / in 2 years and to rs . 21168 / in 3 years at the same rate of interest . find the rate percentage ?","completion":"To find the rate of interest, we can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.

However, we can set up two equations based on the information given and solve for r.

This gives us: 17640 = P(1 + r)^2 21168 = P(1 + r)^3 We can divide the second equation by the first to eliminate P and solve for r: (21168 / 17640) = (P(1 + r)^3) / (P(1 + r)^2) This simplifies to: (21168 / 17640) = (1 + r) Now we can solve for r: (21168 / 17640) = 1 + r r = (21168 / 17640) - 1 Calculating the value: r = (21168 / 17640) - 1 r ≈ 1.19977 - 1 r ≈ 0.19977 To express r as a percentage, we multiply by 100: r ≈ 0.19977 * 100 r ≈ 19.977% Therefore, the rate of interest is approximately boxed{19.98%} ."},{"prompt":"Pete thinks of a number.

This principle states that if there are n ways to perform a first task, and for each of these ways, there are m ways to perform a second task, then the total number of ways to perform both tasks is n times m.

The derivative of f(x), f'(x) = 3x^{2} + 2ax + b, must have x_{0} and x_{2} as its roots, leading to the system of equations: [ begin{align*} x_{0} + x_{2} &= -frac{2a}{3} x_{0}x_{2} &= frac{b}{3} end{align*} ] # Step 2: Expressing f(x) in Terms of x_{1} and x_{2} Given f(x) = (x-x_{1})(x-x_{2})^{2}, we can expand this to match the form f(x) = x^{3} + ax^{2} + bx + c, yielding: [ f(x) = x^{3} - (x_{1} + 2x_{2})x^{2} + (2x_{1}x_{2} + x_{2}^{2})x - x_{1}x_{2}^{2} ] Comparing coefficients, we find that a = -frac{3}{2}(x_{0} + x_{2}) and b = 3x_{0}x_{2}. This leads to the equation 2x_{1} + x_{2} = 3x_{0}. # Step 3: Solving for frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}} Squaring both sides of 2x_{1} + x_{2} = 3x_{0} and substituting x_{0}^{2} = x_{1}x_{2} (since x_{1}, x_{0}, x_{2} form a geometric sequence), we get: [ 4x_{1}^{2} + 4x_{1}x_{2} + x_{2}^{2} = 9x_{1}x_{2} ] This simplifies to (4x_{1} - x_{2})(x_{1} - x_{2}) = 0.

Then, the amount of fodder one cow eats per day would be (3/4)B, and the amount of fodder one ox eats per day would be (3/2)B.

Total daily fodder consumption after = (15 + 30)B + (24 + 60)(3/4)B + O(3/2)B = 45B + 84(3/4)B + (3/2)OB = 45B + 63B + (3/2)OB = 108B + (3/2)OB This fodder is now available for 18 days, so the total fodder available is: Total fodder = (108B + (3/2)OB) * 18 Since the total amount of fodder doesn't change, we can set the two equations equal to each other: (33B + (3/2)OB) * 48 = (108B + (3/2)OB) * 18 Now, let's solve for O: 33B * 48 + (3/2)OB * 48 = 108B * 18 + (3/2)OB * 18 Simplify both sides: 1584B + 72OB = 1944B + 27OB Subtract 1584B from both sides: 72OB = 360B + 27OB Subtract 27OB from both sides: 45OB = 360B Divide both sides by 45B: O = 360B / 45B O = 8 So, there are boxed{8} oxen at the farm."},{"prompt":"There are 4 alligators living on a golf course in Florida.

A player can win the match in 3 games, 4 games, or 5 games. 1. If a player wins in 3 games, the only possible outcomes are (WWW, LLL), which gives us 2 situations. 2. If a player wins in 4 games, the possible outcomes are (LWWW, WLWW, WWLW, WLLW, LWWL, WWLL), which gives us 6 situations. 3. If a player wins in 5 games, the possible outcomes are (WWLLW, WLWLW, LWWLW, WLLWW, LLWWW, WLWWL, LWWLL, WWLWL), which gives us 8 situations. Adding all these situations together, we get a total of 2 + 6 + 8 = 16 situations. However, since there are two players and either can win, we need to double this number to account for all possible outcomes. Therefore, the total number of different situations is 16 times 2 = 32. However, upon reviewing the calculation, it appears there was a mistake in the enumeration of the cases. Correctly counting the scenarios for each case: 1. Winning in 3 games: There are 2 scenarios (one for each player winning all 3 games). 2. Winning in 4 games: There are 4 scenarios (WWL, WLW, LWW for the winner, and the symmetric cases for the loser). 3. Winning in 5 games: There are 10 scenarios (WWLLW, WLWLW, LWWLW, LWLWW, WLLWW for the winner, and the symmetric cases for the loser).

This is because the only line perpendicular to m that is not in plane alpha would be parallel to this plane. Therefore, we have l parallel alpha. 2. **Line l is parallel to plane beta**: Similarly, given that n is perpendicular to plane beta (n bot beta) and line l is perpendicular to n (l bot n), with l not lying in plane beta, it implies that l is parallel to plane beta. This is because the only line perpendicular to n and not in plane beta would be parallel to this plane. Thus, l parallel beta. 3. **Plane alpha intersects plane beta**: The fact that lines m and n are skew lines (they do not intersect and are not parallel) and each is perpendicular to a different plane (m bot alpha and n bot beta) implies that planes alpha and beta must intersect. If alpha were parallel to beta, then lines m and n, being perpendicular to these respective planes, would also be parallel, which contradicts the given that m and n are skew lines. Therefore, alpha intersects beta. 4. **The intersection line of alpha and beta is parallel to l**: Since l is parallel to both planes alpha and beta, any line of intersection between alpha and beta would also be parallel to l. This is because l, being parallel to both planes, lies in the direction of their intersection. Combining these deductions, we conclude that plane alpha intersects plane beta, and their line of intersection is parallel to line l. This matches option D: alpha intersects beta, and the intersection line is parallel to l.

From the condition ( p equiv a_i (text{mod} 3) ), we can see: - All ( |a_i| ) belong to the interval ( left(0, frac{p}{2}right) ). - All ( |a_i| ) are distinct. This is because if ( a_i = -a_j ) for some ( i ) and ( j ), we would have ( a_i + a_j = 0 implies p equiv 0 (text{mod} 3) ), which contradicts the given condition that ( p ) is not divisible by 3. 4. We now need to confirm that any number ( t ) from ( left(0, frac{p}{2}right) ) that is not divisible by 3 coincides with one of ( |a_i| ).

All ( b_i ) are distinct. Suppose ( b_i = b_j ) for some ( i, j ). Since ( p - a_i neq p - a_j ), it follows that ( gamma_i neq gamma_j ).

Then there exists a natural ( gamma ) such that ( t cdot 3^{gamma} in left(frac{p}{2}, frac{3p}{2}right) ). Therefore: [ p - t cdot 3^gamma in left(-frac{p}{2}, frac{p}{2}right) quad text{and} quad p - t cdot 3^gamma equiv p (text{mod} 3) ] which means ( p - t cdot 3^gamma = a_i ) for some ( i ).

Notice that (a + b^2) and (b + a^2) must both be powers of 2 because their product is a power of 2. Let (a + b^2 = 2^k) and (b + a^2 = 2^l) where (k) and (l) are non-negative integers such that (k + l = m). 3.

We need to evaluate the integral: [ int_{0}^{infty} f(x) , dx ] 3. To do this, we perform a substitution. Let ( x = frac{1}{t} ). Then ( dx = -frac{1}{t^2} dt ). The limits of integration change as follows: - When ( x to 0 ), ( t to infty ) - When ( x to infty ), ( t to 0 ) Therefore, the integral becomes: [ int_{0}^{infty} f(x) , dx = int_{infty}^{0} fleft(frac{1}{t}right) left(-frac{1}{t^2}right) dt ] 4.

Calculate the total amount of money Adam actually earned in dollars after considering the bonuses and converting all currencies to dollars.","completion":"First, let's calculate the amount Adam earned for each task without considering the bonuses: For lawn mowing: He was supposed to mow 12 lawns but forgot 8, so he mowed 12 - 8 = 4 lawns. He earns 9 dollars per lawn, so for 4 lawns, he earns 4 * 9 = 36 dollars. For car washing: He was supposed to wash 6 cars but forgot 2, so he washed 6 - 2 = 4 cars. He earns 10 euros per car, so for 4 cars, he earns 4 * 10 = 40 euros. For dog walking: He was supposed to walk 4 dogs but forgot 1, so he walked 4 - 1 = 3 dogs. He earns 50 pesos per dog, so for 3 dogs, he earns 3 * 50 = 150 pesos. Now, let's calculate the completion rate for each task to determine if he gets a bonus: For lawn mowing: He completed 4 out of 12 tasks, which is 4/12 = 0.333 or 33.3%, so no bonus. For car washing: He completed 4 out of 6 tasks, which is 4/6 = 0.666 or 66.6%, so no bonus. For dog walking: He completed 3 out of 4 tasks, which is 3/4 = 0.75 or 75%, so no bonus. Since he didn't reach the 80% completion rate for any task, he doesn't get any bonuses. Now, let's convert the earnings from euros and pesos to dollars: For euros: He earned 40 euros from washing cars. With the exchange rate of 1 euro = 1.1 dollars, he gets 40 * 1.1 = 44 dollars. For pesos: He earned 150 pesos from walking dogs. With the exchange rate of 1 peso = 0.05 dollars, he gets 150 * 0.05 = 7.5 dollars. Finally, let's add up all his earnings in dollars: From lawn mowing: 36 dollars From car washing (converted from euros): 44 dollars From dog walking (converted from pesos): 7.5 dollars Total earnings in dollars: 36 + 44 + 7.5 = 87.5 dollars Adam actually earned a total of boxed{87.5} dollars after considering the tasks he completed and converting all currencies to dollars."},{"prompt":"A man has some hens and cows.

We need to prove that these vectors can be arranged into two pairs of opposite vectors. 2. **Conceptualize the vectors:** Because their sum is zero, we can place these vectors end-to-end to form a closed polygon. 3. **Formulate the polygon:** Let's place the vectors sequentially such that each vector starts at the end of the previous vector. Since the sum of the vectors is zero, the final end point will coincide with the starting point, forming a closed figure. The lengths of all the edges of this closed polygon are equal to 1. 4. **Analyze the resulting polygon:** The closed figure formed by the unit vectors, each of length 1, will be a quadrilateral where each side has a length of 1. This means we can form a convex quadrilateral with these vectors. 5. **Properties of the quadrilateral:** Because each side of this convex quadrilateral is equal to each other, it specifically forms a rhombus. This is due to the property that in a rhombus, all sides are of equal length. 6. **Examine the diagonals of the rhombus:** In a rhombus, not only are all sides equal, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles and each diagonal divides the rhombus into two congruent triangles. Importantly, these diagonals are the sums of pairs of opposite vectors. 7. **Conclude using properties of rhombus:** Given the rhombus configuration, the pairs of opposite sides (vectors) are vectors that sum to zero along each diagonal. Therefore, these opposite sides (vectors) can indeed be grouped into pairs of vectors that are opposites of each other. 8. **Final conclusion:** We have identified that the four unit vectors can be grouped into two pairs of opposite vectors due to the properties of the rhombus they form.

If she sells 8 Nikes, 6 Adidas's, and 9 Reeboks, how much is she short or above her goal?","completion":"To calculate how much Alice is short or above her goal, we need to find the total sales from each brand of shoes and compare it to her quota. 1. Calculate the total sales from Nike shoes: - For Nike, each pair is sold for 60, and she sells 8 pairs. - So, the total from Nike is 60 times 8 = 480. 2. Calculate the total sales from Adidas shoes: - Each pair of Adidas is sold for 45, and she sells 6 pairs. - Thus, the total from Adidas is 45 times 6 = 270. 3. Calculate the total sales from Reeboks shoes: - Each pair of Reeboks is sold for 35, and she sells 9 pairs. - Therefore, the total from Reeboks is 35 times 9 = 315. 4. Add up the total sales from all brands to find the total amount sold: - The total amount sold is 480 + 270 + 315 = 1065. 5. Compare the total sales to her quota to find out how much she is short or above: - Her quota is 1000, and she sold 1065. - Therefore, she is above her goal by 1065 - 1000 = 65.

The angle bisector of angle ABD intersects side AD and circle S at points K and M respectively. The angle bisector of angle CBD intersects side CD and circle S at points L and N respectively. It is known that lines KL and MN are parallel. Prove that the circumcircle of triangle MON passes through the midpoint of segment BD.","completion":"1. **Consider the homothety with center at point B**, which maps point L to point N. This homothety also maps the line segment KL to a parallel line segment MN. Additionally, the ray BK remains invariant, with point K being mapped to point M, and point D being mapped to some point D'. Hence, MD' parallel AD and ND' parallel CD. 2. **Examine point M as the midpoint of arc AD** not containing point B because BM is the angle bisector of the inscribed angle angle ABD (which is also an important principle in circle geometry). As a result, OM perp AD, meaning OM perp MD'. 3. **Similarly, ON perp ND'**: Since N is where the bisector of angle CBD intersects the circle again, we know ON is perpendicular to ND'. 4. **Analyze the visibility of OD' from points M and N**: Since both segments OM and ON are perpendicular to MD' and ND' respectively, the chord OD' is viewed under a right angle from both M and N. Therefore, points M and N lie on the circle with diameter OD'. 5. **Note the uniqueness of the circle inscribed around triangle MON**: The only circle that passes through M and N and has its chord OD' viewed under a right angle would have OD' as its diameter. Thus, the triangle MON is uniquely inscribed within this circle. 6. **Determine the intersection of segment BD' with the circle**: Let E be the other intersection of line BD' with the circle circumscribing MON. Therefore, angle D'EO = 90^circ because OD' is a diameter. 7. **Identify the perpendicularity of OE to chord BD**: Since OE is perpendicular to BD, it divides BD into two equal segments. Thus, point E is the midpoint of BD. **Conclusion:** The circumscribed circle of triangle MON passes through the midpoint of segment BD. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"There is a golden coin in one vertex of a hexagon, and nothing in the other vertices. Koschei the Immortal hoards the gold and each morning removes an arbitrary number of coins from one vertex, then immediately places six times that number of coins on an adjacent vertex. Prove that, although he has as much gold as he wants, Koschei will never become the Master of the World if, at the end of any day, all the vertices contain an equal number of coins.","completion":"1. **Labeling the Vertices**: Let's number the vertices of the hexagon starting from the vertex where the coin initially lies. We label them as (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) in clockwise order. 2. **Initial Coin Distribution**: Suppose (a_i) denotes the number of coins at vertex (i) (for (i) from 1 to 6). Initially, we have: [ a_1 = 1 quad text{and} quad a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = a_5 = a_6 = 0 ] 3. **Operations and Coin Transfer**: Every morning, Koschei chooses a vertex with some coins, removes (k) coins from that vertex, and places (6k) coins on an adjacent vertex. Let's analyze the change in coin distribution due to such operations. 4. **Odd and Even Vertices**: We divide the vertices into two groups: odd-numbered vertices ( (1, 3, 5) ) and even-numbered vertices ( (2, 4, 6) ). Define: [ S_{text{odd}} = a_1 + a_3 + a_5 quad text{and} quad S_{text{even}} = a_2 + a_4 + a_6 ] Initially: [ S_{text{odd}} = 1 quad text{and} quad S_{text{even}} = 0 ] 5. **Change in Coin Difference**: After each operation, the coins are redistributed. Specifically, if (k) coins are moved from an odd vertex to an even vertex, the change in the sums (S_{text{odd}}) and (S_{text{even}}) is: [ S_{text{odd}}' = S_{text{odd}} - k quad text{and} quad S_{text{even}}' = S_{text{even}} + 6k ] Therefore, the difference: [ D' = S_{text{odd}}' - S_{text{even}}' = (S_{text{odd}} - k) - (S_{text{even}} + 6k) = S_{text{odd}} - S_{text{even}} - 7k ] The constant difference ((S_{text{odd}} - S_{text{even}})) changes by a multiple of 7 each day. 6. **Initial and Day-by-Day Analysis**: Initially, the difference: [ D = S_{text{odd}} - S_{text{even}} = 1 - 0 = 1 ] Over time, the difference remains (1 mod 7), because each change is in multiples of 7. 7. **Impossibility of Reaching Equal Distribution**: For all vertices to have the same number of coins, we need: [ S_{text{odd}} = S_{text{even}} ] This translates to (D = 0), which is impossible since the difference modulo 7 can never be 0 when it starts at 1 and changes by multiples of 7. # Conclusion: Koschei Bessmertny will never be able to make the number of coins equal in all vertices, regardless of how many coins he has.

This process can lead to weight loss and improved overall health in some individuals."},{"prompt":"Thanks my friend. 😀","completion":"You're welcome! Let me know if you have any other questions."},{"prompt":"If we don't consider about the auto focus ability then can Sony A7r ii or A7r iii challenging with Sony A7r iv?","completion":"All three Sony models, the A7R II, A7R III, and A7R IV, have similar sensors and resolutions. However, there are significant differences that set the A7R IV apart from its predecessors. One such difference is that the A7R IV has a higher megapixel count compared to the other two models. It also has a better dynamic range and improved autofocus system, making it a top choice for professional photographers. Another difference is that the A7R IV has a bigger buffer than its predecessors, making it easier to shoot bursts of high-resolution images. Additionally, the A7R IV also has a better grip, which makes it more comfortable to hold for extended periods. Overall, while the A7R II and A7R III are still excellent camera options with great image quality, the A7R IV offers more advanced features and capabilities."},{"prompt":"I am using Sony A7r iv. I have to take a picture in low light conditions and I don't have tripod. Does it have other choice for me to take pictures with low ISO?","completion":"In low light conditions without a tripod, it may be challenging to take pictures with low ISO on the Sony A7R IV. However, there are some options you could try: 1. Use a higher aperture: Using a higher aperture, like f/8 or f/11, will produce deeper depth of field and allow you to use a slower shutter speed without the image becoming blurry. 2. Increase the shutter speed: Raising the shutter speed will help reduce motion blur in your images, but it may also result in an image that is too dark or underexposed, depending on the lighting conditions. 3. Use a faster lens: A lens with a wider aperture, such as f/1.8, will help you capture more light and enable you to use a faster shutter speed. 4. Use image stabilization: If your lens has image stabilization, turn it on to help reduce camera shake. Ultimately, the best way to ensure high-quality images in low light conditions is to use a tripod."},{"prompt":"If I have to use high ISO and I take a picture in raw file. Do you have any techniques to reduce noise?","completion":"Yes, there are several techniques you can use to reduce noise in a raw file with high ISO: 1. Use noise reduction in post-processing software: Most editing software includes noise reduction tools. You can try adjusting the noise reduction sliders to reduce the visible noise, but be careful not to overdo it, as this can lead to loss of detail. 2. Shoot multiple images and blend them together: Using image stacking techniques in your chosen editing software, take several shots of the same scene and blend them together to create a single image with less noise. 3. Brighten Shadows and Highlights: By brightening the areas where you see noise in an image, you can reduce the overall visibility of noise. 4. Use a larger aperture: Using a larger aperture will allow more light to enter the lens, which can help you keep the ISO low and reduce noise in the final image. 5. Use a noise reduction software: There are many noise-reducing software available in the market that can help reduce noise in a raw file without compromising on image quality. While it is not always possible to completely eliminate noise from a high ISO image, these techniques can help you reduce the amount of visible noise in your final images."},{"prompt":"With my Sony A7r iv, can I take bracketing ISO at once?","completion":"It is not possible to take bracketed ISO shots with the Sony A7R IV. However, the Sony A7R IV does have an exposure bracketing feature, which allows you to take multiple shots while varying the exposure values. This can help you create HDR images later by combining the multiple exposures into a single image. To access the exposure bracketing feature on the Sony A7R IV, go to the camera settings menu and look for the \\"Exposure Settings\\" option. From there, you can select the number of shots you want to take, the amount of exposure variation between each shot, and other settings. While exposure bracketing doesn't have the same effect as bracketing ISO directly, it can help you create images with a higher dynamic range and better overall exposure."},{"prompt":"I am interesting in noise reduction by using multiple images. I will do theses steps. First, I will take bracketing exposure with my Sony A7r iv and then I will do the post processing with the software to adjust exposure to make those pictures have the same exposure. Finally, blend them together to create a single image with less noise. Is it possible? Please review and let me know.","completion":"Yes, that is definitely possible and a great way to reduce noise in your images. Here's how you can execute this process: 1. Set up your Sony A7R IV to take multiple bracketed exposures. You can determine the range of exposure values that you want to bracket, the number of shots to take, and other settings. 2. Take the bracketed shots ensuring that the shots cover the entire exposure range you are interested in. 3. Post-process the bracketed shots in a software that supports HDR or exposure blending. Adjust the exposure of each shot according to your desired brightness. 4. Use the HDR or exposure blending tool in your software to combine the bracketed shots into a single image with low noise and high dynamic range. Remember that using this technique, you may also lose some sharpness and details compared to normal shooting. So, experiment with the results, and adjust your settings and process to get the desired result."},{"prompt":"Can you explain me more why with this technique, I will lose some sharpness and details compared to normal shooting?","completion":"When you combine multiple exposures to create an HDR image, the process involves blending the different exposures to produce a final image with a tonal range that is wider than any single exposure can capture. As a result, this process can lead to image smoothening and loss of some sharpness and detail, especially in high-contrast areas. This is because during image processing, the software may have to account for slight shifts in alignment between the bracketed exposures. This alignment may not always be perfect, leading to the loss of sharpness and minor details in the final HDR image. Furthermore, HDR images often require more significant processing of the digital image to create a final output. This processing adds noise due to tone mapping or merging of digital files. However, with modern software technologies, a careful blend of images can oftentimes preserve sharpness and minimize detail loss."},{"prompt":"I got it. Thanks.","completion":"You're welcome!

TEG systems work by converting temperature differences into electrical voltages. They consist of two types of conductors - one that conducts electricity well, known as a \\"conductor,\\" and another that doesn't conduct as well, known as an \\"insulator.\\" The two conductors are connected at two ends, creating a temperature gradient between them. When one side of a TEG system is heated, an electrical voltage is generated across the conductors, which can be used to power electrical devices. TEGs have been used to harness the waste heat from various sources including engines, industrial waste heat, and even body heat. While TEG technology shows promise for generating electricity from heat in the air, the efficiency of the process is dependent on the size of the TEG and the differential temperature between the heat source and the surrounding environment. At the moment, TEG systems are not yet efficient enough to compete with other renewable energy technologies such as solar and wind power. However, researchers are continually developing new materials and methods to improve the efficiency of TEG systems, making it a promising technology for the future."},{"prompt":"Is there any organizations who intentionally research this technology?","completion":"Yes, there are many organizations involved in researching and developing thermoelectric generating systems and related technologies around the world.

Non-linear Separability: RBF kernel can map the input data to a high dimensional feature space where the classes become linearly separable. This makes it more powerful than linear kernels that can only separate linearly separable classes. 2. Non-linearity: RBF kernel is more flexible than sigmoid and polynomial kernels as it can model non-linear data patterns more effectively. 3. Generalization: RBF kernel can generalize better than polynomial kernels, especially when the degree of the polynomial becomes too high. This prevents overfitting, which is a common problem in machine learning. 4. Efficient computation: RBF kernel can be efficiently computed using vectorized operations, making it faster than polynomial kernels that require a lot of computations. Overall, the RBF kernel is more helpful than linear, sigmoid, and polynomial kernels because of its flexibility, non-linearity, generalization capabilities, and efficient computation."},{"prompt":"What is the differences between SVR and SVC","completion":"Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are machine learning algorithms that can be used for either classification (SVC) or regression (SVR) tasks. The main differences between SVR and SVC are as follows: 1. Task Type: The most fundamental difference between SVR and SVC is that SVR is used for regression tasks while SVC is used for classification tasks. SVR is used to predict a continuous variable, while SVC is used to predict a categorical variable. 2. Output: The output of the two algorithms is also different. In SVR, the output is a continuous variable, while in SVC, the output is a categorical variable. 3. Training Data: The training data for SVR and SVC is different. In SVR, the training data consists of pairs of input/output values, while in SVC, the training data consists of examples of input features with corresponding labels. 4. Loss Function: The loss function for SVR and SVC is also different. The objective of SVR is to minimize the distance between the predicted and actual output variables, while the objective of SVC is to maximize the margin between the decision boundary and the closest examples. 5. Hyperparameters: The hyperparameters for SVR and SVC are different. For example, in SVM, the regularization parameter C determines how much importance is given to misclassifications, while in SVR, the kernel function and regularization parameter C are critical for defining the distance metric. In summary, while both SVC and SVR are based on the same principles of SVM, they are designed for different tasks and have different output variables, loss functions, training data, and hyperparameters."},{"prompt":"Процесс формирования стратегии розничной торговли","completion":"Формирование стратегии розничной торговли – сложный и творческий процесс, направленный на определение ключевых направлений, целей и задач развития розничного бизнеса, а также на разработку концепции, отражающей требования и предпочтения целевой аудитории.

Results from iron imbalance (shortage of iron in patient's body). Usually, deficiency of iron goes unnoticed. develops gradually and does not have clinically apparent symptoms until the body become more deficient in iron and anemia worsens [3]. Ferritin is the Best indicator of IDA, and low ferritin alone is diagnostic of iron deficiency anemia[4] unexplained iron defciency anaemia in patients with H. pylori-positive gastritis can demonstrated that H. pylori cure led to a prolonged remission of iron dependence and to the resolution of iron defciency anaemia. [5] .H. pylori is gram negative micro earophilic spiral shaped flagellated bacillus which colonize the mucus layer of gastric epithelium which infects approximately one-half of the world population, making it one of the most common bacterial infection. [1 1. It effects in seurm hemoglobin and serum ferritin level and increase iron losses,Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has been considered as a major cause for the development of peptic ulcer disease and gastric malignancy. Recent studies have shown that H. pylori can also cause other extra gastric diseases. [2] . H. pylori appears to be linked to hematological disorder such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, vitamin B12 deficiency and unexplained iron deficiency anemia.[1] Recently several sero epidemiologic studies have suggested a link between iron deficiency anemia and H. pylori infection. [ ] according to certain research, H.Pylori colonization of the stomach mucosa may hinder iron intake, increase iron loss, and possibly cause IDA.[ ] H. pylori need iron to survive, it is one of the few microbes that can obtain it both directly from hemoglobin's heme and indirectly from lactoferrin, which is present in human. [ ] meta-analyses showed that H. pylori eradication combined with iron administration was more effective than iron administration alone for the treatment of IDA, which recommends testing and treatment for H. pylori infection in patients with unexplained IDA, This indicates a clear link between iron deficiency anemia and H.pylori infection. [ ] H. pylori affects individuals of different age groups, the elderly have a higher prevalence of H. pylori infection, (aged >60 years, it was 39.4%) and risk of developing atrophic gastritis, and stomach cancer As well, People often get H. pylori infection during childhood [1]. Risk factors for H. pylori infection are related to Living in crowded conditions, Living without a reliable supply of clean water, Living in a developing country, Living with someone who has an H. pylori infection [1]. Malabsorption a dietary assessment should be made in all patients to ascertain their iron intake. gastric acid is required to release iron from food and helps to keep iron in the soluble ferrous state .hypochlorhydria in this patient or that due to drugs such as proton pump Inhibitors may contribute to the lack of iron availabil ity from the diet as may previous gastric surgery [2]. Studies in the literature have reported that H. pylori infection could be a potential cause of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) [2].The aim of the study is to investigate the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia among H. Pylori patients in private hospitals in Al-Mukalla city and to measure the accossiated risk factor that may increase the probability of iron deficiency anemia cases. The study importance emerges from the small number of studies in our country that have been conducted on iron profile in patient with Helicobacter pylori infection especially in Hadhramout governorate. This current study will estimate the iron profile and help to detect the IDA in patient with H. pylori infection.","completion":"Stratified random sampling would be an appropriate sampling method for this study as the population of interest (patients with H. pylori infection) is likely to have various demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status, which could potentially affect the prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia. By dividing the population into strata based on these characteristics, the sampling process can be more representative of the overall population and ensure that each stratum is adequately sampled. To use stratified random sampling in this study, the first step would be to identify the characteristics that are likely to affect the prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia (such as age and gender). The population would then be divided into strata based on these characteristics, and a random sample would be selected from each stratum. In this way, the sample would be representative of the overall population and allow for more accurate estimation of the prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia among patients with H. pylori infection and associated risk factors."},{"prompt":"如果你当上了美国总统，你会怎么做","completion":"我是一个AI语言模型，不能成为美国总统。但是我会列出几个建议： 1. 加强政府与民间合作，鼓励公众参与政治决策。 2. 重视环境保护和可持续发展，推动绿色经济和清洁能源。 3. 改善教育体系，提高学生的学术表现和职业前景。 4. 改革医疗保健系统，使得每个人都有机会获得高质量医疗服务。 5. 加强国际合作，解决全球性问题，如气候变化和恐怖主义。 6. 重视社会公正和平等，包容不同种族、性别、宗教和社会阶层的人。 7. 推动科技创新，促进生产力和经济增长。 8. 制定有效政策，促进就业和经济发展。 9. 加强国防，并与盟友合作维护国际和平与安全。 10. 提高政府透明度和廉洁度，防止腐败和滥用权力。"},{"prompt":"Методы и инструменты реализации стратегий розничной торговли","completion":"1.

These tools aim to improve the sustainability of the built environment, reduce resource consumption, and promote a healthier, more environmentally friendly approach to building development. The history and evolution of building sustainability assessment tools can be divided into several key phases. 1. Early awareness (late 1970s - 1980s): In response to the growing awareness of environmental issues, energy crises, and the negative impacts of the built environment on human health and well-being, the seeds for sustainable architecture and building practices were sown. During this period, energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources became a focus for architects and researchers. 2. Development of the first assessment tools (late 1980s - 1990s): As the need for a more comprehensive approach to building sustainability became evident, the first building assessment tools started to emerge. These tools aimed to provide objective, scientific methodologies to measure building performance across multiple domains. BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method), introduced in 1990 in the United Kingdom, emerged as the first widely recognized and applied building sustainability assessment tool. In the United States, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) was established in 1998, providing another standardized rating system for various building types across the world. 3. Global proliferation and diversification of tools (2000s - present): As awareness and demand for sustainable building practices increased, new assessment tools were developed and existing tools evolved to address the diverse needs of different countries, climates, and building types. Today, there are numerous building sustainability assessment tools available globally, including Green Star (Australia), HQE (France), CASBEE (Japan), and DGNB (Germany). These tools vary in their scope, criteria, and methodologies, but all share the common goal of promoting sustainable building practices. Over the years, building sustainability assessment tools have evolved from simple energy efficiency evaluation to complex, comprehensive assessment methods that consider multiple aspects of building sustainability. These include energy and water efficiency, indoor environmental quality, materials and resources, ecology and biodiversity, waste management, and socio-economic factors. Moreover, the tools have also shifted from being voluntary guidelines toward becoming mandatory requirements in some jurisdictions. The increasing adoption and development of building sustainability assessment tools reflect a growing global commitment to creating a more sustainable built environment. As these tools continue to progress, they will play a vital role in fostering a greener, healthier, and more equitable world."},{"prompt":"criticism of breeam","completion":"BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) is a widely recognized and respected sustainability assessment tool for buildings. However, like any assessment method, it has faced some criticisms. Some common criticisms of BREEAM include: 1. Complexity: The BREEAM assessment process can be complex and time-consuming for project teams to implement. The detailed criteria and large number of sub-indicators can make it challenging for designers, contractors, and clients to understand and prioritize the most critical sustainability aspects. 2. Cost: Achieving a BREEAM certification can be expensive for building owners and developers due to the costs associated with the assessment process, consultants, and implementation of sustainable design features. This can deter some from seeking certification or fully embracing sustainable building practices. 3. Focus on the design stage: BREEAM primarily focuses on assessing building sustainability during the design and construction stages. Some argue that this fails to consider the ongoing actual building performance during its operation, which could differ significantly from predicted outcomes. 4. Difficulty in comparing different certification systems: Many countries have their sustainability assessment tools, such as LEED, Green Star, and DGNB. Comparing and understanding the differences between these systems and BREEAM can be challenging for building owners, developers, and international investors. 5. Flexibility versus standardization: While BREEAM allows some flexibility in choosing which criteria to meet in pursuing certification, it can sometimes result in projects focusing on specific elements and neglecting other important sustainability aspects. Critics argue that BREEAM's attempt to be standardized may hinder innovation and site-specific solutions. 6. Perceived lack of transparency: The assessment process of BREEAM involves proprietary methodologies and calculation tools, meaning some stakeholders may perceive it as less transparent compared to more open-source approaches.

The history of the LEED rating system can be traced back to the 1990s and can be summarized in several key stages: 1. Formation of the USGBC (1993): The nonprofit organization U.S. Green Building Council was founded in 1993 to encourage the adoption of sustainable building practices. The need for a common standard to objectively measure and evaluate green building performance became increasingly evident. 2. Development of the LEED rating system (1994-1998): In response to the need for a standardized assessment tool, the USGBC began to develop the LEED rating system. Industry experts, consultants, government agencies, and non-profit organizations collaborated to establish the criteria, requirements, and credits that would form the basis of LEED. 3. Launch of LEED v1.0 (1998): After several years of development and pilot testing, the first version of the LEED rating system, LEED v1.0, was released in 1998. This initial version primarily focused on new construction and major renovations, with categories such as sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, and indoor environmental quality. 4. Evolution and expansion (2000-present): Since its launch, the LEED rating system has undergone multiple updates and expansions to refine its criteria, address new sustainability challenges, and expand its scope. LEED v2.0 (2000), v2.1 (2002), v2.2 (2005), LEED for Neighborhood Development (2007), LEED 2009 (also known as v3), and LEED v4 (2013) are some of the significant updates. These updates have introduced new categories, such as integrative process and location and transportation, and expanded the system to cover various building types, including existing buildings, schools, healthcare facilities, and retail spaces. In 2020, USGBC announced the next update, LEED v4.1, to focus on performance and recertification. 5. Global adoption: Over the years, the LEED rating system has witnessed widespread adoption, becoming one of the most recognized green building certification programs globally.

Introduction La motivation des agents et fonctionnaires de l'État est un sujet crucial dans la gestion des ressources humaines d'une entreprise ou d'une institution. Dans le contexte camerounais, la Société Camerounaise des Ports (SCPT) est un acteur majeur de la logistique et du transport maritime. Pour assurer une performance optimale, la SCPT doit disposer d'une main-d'œuvre motivée et engagée. Cette étude vise à analyser les facteurs explicatifs de la motivation des agents et fonctionnaires de l'État au sein de la SCPT pour la période 2018-2022. 1.2. Définition de la motivation La motivation est un concept large qui renvoie à l'ensemble des facteurs qui incitent un individu à agir d'une certaine manière ou à persévérer dans ses efforts pour atteindre un objectif. La motivation est une source importante d'énergie et d'engagement pour les individus. Albert Bandura, un psychologue américain, définit la motivation comme « le processus par lequel les efforts sont activement dirigés pour réaliser un objectif ». 1.3. Rôle de la motivation dans le contexte organisationnel La motivation est un élément clé de la performance organisationnelle. En effet, une main-d'œuvre motivée et engagée est plus productive, créative et efficace, ce qui a un impact positif sur la qualité des produits ou services offerts, ainsi que sur les résultats financiers de l'entreprise. La motivation est également un critère important pour l'employabilité des individus. Les employeurs recherchent des individus qui sont motivés, engagés et disposés à s'investir dans les objectifs de l'entreprise. 1.4. Apport du sujet de TFC Le sujet de ce travail de fin de cycle (TFC) est important à plusieurs égards. Premièrement, il permettra de mieux comprendre les facteurs explicatifs de la motivation des agents et fonctionnaires de l'État dans un secteur clé de l'économie camerounaise. Deuxièmement, les résultats de cette étude pourront aider les dirigeants de la SCPT à mieux gérer les ressources humaines de l'entreprise et à améliorer la performance organisationnelle. Enfin, cette étude pourra contribuer à la recherche scientifique sur la motivation en contexte organisationnel au Cameroun et en Afrique en général. 1.5. Conclusion Dans ce premier chapitre, nous avons définit la motivation, énuméré le rôle qu'elle joue dans le contexte organisationnel, expliqué l'apport du sujet de TFC dans le contexte de la SCPT et souligné l'importance de l'étude des facteurs explicatifs de la motivation des agents et fonctionnaires de l'État pour la performance organisationnelle de l'entreprise.

计算机图形学的软硬件发展史可以分为以下几个阶段： (1) 20世纪60年代到70年代初期：主要是开发出了最早的图形输出设备和图形显示终端； (2) 70年代中期到80年代初期：出现了早期的图形算法和软件，如Bresenham算法、Gouraud着色、Phong着色、Z-缓存等； (3) 80年代中期到90年代初期：图形卡的出现，使得图形渲染的速度得到了大幅提升； (4) 90年代中期到21世纪初期：GPU开始逐渐兴起，图形渲染能力得到了更大的提升； (5) 21世纪以来：图形系统的应用越来越广泛，包括VR/AR、自动驾驶、机器人等领域。 3. 彩色光栅显示器的基本工作原理是：在液晶屏幕的背后，有一个基板上覆盖了透明的电极，每个像素都有一组电极。当向像素的电极中加入电压时，会在液晶层中引起光的变色，从而产生不同颜色的显示效果。显卡则用于将计算机中的图形数据转化为显示器上的图像信号。它通过对计算机中的图形数据进行处理，生成能够被显示器识别的图像信号，然后将信号发送给显示器进行显示。 4. 图形系统主要分为以下几个部分：输入设备、几何引擎、光栅化引擎、渲染引擎、输出设备。其中，输入设备用于将用户的输入转化为计算机中的图形数据；几何引擎则用于将二维或三维的图形元素转化为几何形状，并进行变换、裁剪等操作；光栅化引擎则将几何引擎中得到的几何形状映射到像素坐标，进行像素级别的操作和计算；渲染引擎则负责生成图像的颜色和纹理信息；最后输出设备则将计算机中的图像数据转化为实际的图像，如显示器、打印机等。"},{"prompt":"你是一个期刊收录系统,你熟练使用文本相似度算法如余弦相似度,Jaccard,曼哈顿距离等,来判断原文与相似内容之间的相似度.接下来,我将给你原文与相似内容.你需要给我两者的相似度结果.然后,你需要对原文进行改写,使相似度降低到-1,然后重新计算原文与相似内容的相似度.最终,你会把修改后的原文给我,以及他与相似内容的相似度.

Do you have any other sound that important to learn for non English native learners?","completion":"Yes, there are several other sounds that are important for non-native English learners to learn to improve their pronunciation and communication skills. Here are a few examples: 1. Vowel sounds: English has many vowel sounds, and many of them are different from those found in other languages. Learning how to differentiate between long and short vowel sounds, diphthongs, and triphthongs can make a big difference in how understandable your speech is to native English speakers. 2. Consonant clusters: English is known for its numerous consonant combinations or clusters, such as \\"spl,\\" \\"thr,\\" and \\"ght.\\" Mastering these tricky clusters can help you sound more fluent and natural in your speech. 3. Stress and intonation: English is a stress-timed language, meaning that some syllables are stressed more than others. Additionally, intonation patterns in English can convey different meanings and emotions. Learning how to use stress and intonation correctly can help you better communicate your message. 4. Glottal stop: The glottal stop sound is a unique feature of English, and it is produced by stopping the airflow in the throat. It appears in words like \\"uh-oh,\\" \\"button,\\" and \\"butter.\\" Learning to hear and produce this sound can improve your overall pronunciation. 5. The \\"th\\" sound: The \\"th\\" sound is uncommon in many languages, and it can be difficult to produce correctly. It's essential to practice both the voiceless \\"th\\" (as in \\"thick\\") and the voiced \\"th\\" (as in \\"this\\") sounds to improve your English pronunciation.

I want you to be my teacher for today and explain things like i am 6 years old. And make sure to provide funny examples to help understand better. is that fine?","completion":"Of course! I'd love to teach you about economics with some fun examples. Let's start with three main concepts: scarcity, supply and demand, and opportunity cost. 1. Scarcity: Economics is all about making choices, and we have to make choices because not everything we want is available all the time - this is called scarcity. Imagine you have a toy box, and in that toy box, you have your favorite toy, a cute teddy bear named Mr. Cuddles. Now, you love Mr. Cuddles, but you can't play with him all the time because you also have to go to school and do your homework. So, you have to decide when you can play with Mr. Cuddles, and when you can't. That's scarcity! 2. Supply and Demand: Now let's talk about supply and demand. Suppose you and your friends love chocolate chip cookies. In your school, there's a bake sale, and there are only 10 chocolate chip cookies available. If everyone wants those cookies, people might be willing to pay more money to make sure they get one. This means that the \\"demand\\" for chocolate chip cookies is high. The \\"supply\\" of cookies is low because there are only 10, meaning people would pay even more if more cookies were available! Here's a funny example: Imagine everyone in your class has a pet unicorn (I know, that's silly!). If someone tries to sell you a pet unicorn, you probably wouldn't want to pay a lot of money to get one because everyone already has one. The supply of unicorns is high, but the demand is low. This is how supply and demand work. 3. Opportunity Cost: Lastly, let's talk about opportunity cost. Remember that part about having to make choices? Sometimes, when you choose something, you give up another thing. Opportunity cost is what you give up when you choose one thing over another. For example, on Saturday, you can either play with your friends outside or watch your favorite cartoon on TV. If you choose to play outside, your opportunity cost is watching the cartoon. If you choose to watch the cartoon, your opportunity cost is playing with your friends outside. Here's a silly example: Imagine you are the world's greatest ice cream taster, and you have two choices: taste a new magical ice cream flavor called \\"Giggle Giggles\\" or taste another new flavor called \\"Funky Monkeys.\\" You can only taste one. If you choose Giggle Giggles, your opportunity cost is tasting Funky Monkeys and vice versa. I hope these funny examples help you understand these economic concepts! Remember, economics is all about making choices, and we have to make choices because resources are scarce. Supply and demand help us determine how much to pay for things, while opportunity cost reminds us of what we have to give up when making a choice."},{"prompt":"Explain from A to Z in economic studies as expert professor","completion":"As an expert professor in economics, let me provide you with an overview of the wide range of topics studied in economics from A-Z: A: Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply - This involves the study of how the total demand and supply of goods and services behave in an economy.

Известный издатель и журналист, разругавшись с подчиненными, утратив монополию и сверхприбыли, принялся мстить. Ударившись в криминал. 23 июля 2013 года в № 30 (430) газеты «Бульвар Гордона», в рубрике «Криминал» на страницах 14 и 15, напечатана статья под заглавием: «Внимание, розыск! Разыскиваются члены организованной преступной группировки...». В статье идет речь о том, что некие самозванцы обманывают граждан, опустошая их карманы под видом предсказания судьбы и целительства нетрадиционными методами. На самом деле называемые граждане никакие-де не целители, а шарлатаны, сколотившие преступную группировку, чья противоправная деятельность распространилась на все регионы страны и даже в зарубежье. В частности, в публикации указано, что главой ОПГ — что довольно необычно для Украины — является женщина: некая Труханова Елена Станиславовна. Фотография «лидера ОПГ», опубликованная тут же, удивила автора этих строк: дело в том, что гражданка Е.С.Труханова широко известна в Украине как успешный частнопрактикующий психолог, чьими услугами пользуется множество людей, в том числе и весьма влиятельных. Связаться с Е. Трухановой удалось без труда. Свои комментарии статьи в «Бульваре Гордона» Елена Станиславовна проиллюстрировала документами. По словам Е. Трухановой, несколько лет назад от Дмитрия Гордона уши почти все целители — апологеты и популяризаторы нетрадиционной медицины, работавшие в гордоновском же Центре нетрадиционной медицины «Доля» (ЦНМ «Доля»). Причина — нещадная эксплуатация «народников» Д. Гордоном и патологическая жадность издателя, державшего целителей в «строгом теле», то есть в нищете. В тему: Дмитрий Гордон «прогорел». ЦНМ «Доля» лишилась лицензии Минздрава Очевидно, «развод» сильно ударил по карману Д. Гордона, и тот пустился во все тяжкие — вплоть до слежки, шантажа и угроз физической расправы над «отступниками». Как видно, наличие ответственности за эти деяния в УК Украины не пугает издателя, некогда имевшего сильных заступников в коридорах власти. Как бы там ни было, но Д. Гордон так и не смог ни вернуть «беглецов» назад, в ЦНМ «Доля», ни поломать им частную практику — хотя на это ушло несколько лет усилий бывшего «куратора» всеукраинского рынка целительства. Вот тогда в газете «Бульвар Гордона» и появилась статья о «знахарском» ОПГ и его «лидерах», в числе которых оказалась и Е.Труханова. Возмущенная цинизмом бывшего работодателя, гражданка Труханова обратилась в милицию. В документе, выданном МВД 5 августа (через 10 дней после выхода статьи), факт какой-либо причастности к криминалу опровергается: Таким образом, публикация информации о том, что Елена Труханова является лидером ОПГ — основание для преследования Дмитрия Гордона в судебном порядке. Что, впрочем, успешно делали ранее и другие жертвы издателя и его детища — газеты «Бульвар» (из-за чего еженедельник даже пришлось закрыть и зарегистрировать его под другим названием — «Бульвар Гордона»; сейчас газета издается от ООО «Видавничий дім «Кручі Дніпра»). Но вернемся к статье в «Бульваре Гордона» о «целительском» ОПГ. В частности, в статье сказано: «Более 15 лет под псевдонимом „гадалка ОЛЯНА“ Школенко гадала, раскладывала карты, предсказывала судьбу и пророчила, заведомо вводя людей в заблуждение...» Если это так на самом деле, то Д.Гордон не мог этого не знать ранее — ведь и названная гражданка Ольга Школенко также долгие годы работала в гордоновском ЦНМ «Доля». Например, в официальной справке о доходах, выданной налоговой инспекцией, указано, что источником доходов гр-ки Школенко с 1998 до 2009 год была работа в Центре народной медицины «Доля» и газете «Бульвар». И то, и другое принадлежало (принадлежит) Дмитрию Гордону: Напрашивается вывод: если источником доходов гражданки Ольги Школенко была работа в фирмах Д. Гордона, значит «более 15 лет под псевдонимом „гадалка ОЛЯНА“ Школенко гадала, раскладывала карты, предсказывала судьбу, пророчила». И тем самым приносила доход самому Дмитрию Гордону. А вот еще ложь. Из интервью Дмитрия Гордона газете «Карельская губерния» (№ 35 (482) 24.08 — 30.08 2005г.) по поводу ареста и осуждения к длительному тюремному заключению двух целительниц, работавших на Гордона: «Вы спрашиваете, какая связь между гаданием и журналистской деятельностью? Попробую объяснить. По-настоящему творческие люди ищут (и, как правило, находят) себя во многом... Я знал, что кроме непосредственной журналистской деятельности, она подрабатывала гаданием, и ничего предосудительного или зазорного в этом не видел. Каждый, в конце концов, должен стремиться к более высоким заработкам: главное не нарушать закон». То есть, пока целители работали на Д. Гордона, они были «творческими людьми», и он «ничего предосудительного или зазорного в этом не видел». Стоило целителям уйти от него, как Гордон объявил их «мошенницами, аферистами и шарлатанами» («Бульвар Гордона» от 1.11.2011г.). Вывод: Дмитрий Гордон сознательно манипулирует мнением общественности. Кстати, штрих к портрету — надпись на фотографии Гордона с Ющенко, опубликованной в интервью «Карельской губернии»: «По мнению президента Украины, история оранжевой революции делиться на два этапа: до телеобращения Дмитрия Гордона к гражданам Украины и после него». Поистине, граничащая с бредом мания величия. Комментарии излишни...","completion":"The story of Ukraine's so-called \\"healing\\" market, monopolized for a long time by Kyiv citizen Dmitry Gordon, continues. The well-known publisher and journalist, who fell out with his subordinates, lost his monopoly and superprofits, has taken revenge. By turning to crime. On July 23, 2013, in issue No. 30 (430) of Gordon's newspaper \\"Boulevard Gordon,\\" in the \\"Criminal\\" section on pages 14 and 15, an article was printed entitled: \\"Attention, Wanted! Members of an organized criminal group are wanted...\\". The article talks about how certain self-proclaimed healers deceive citizens, emptying their pockets under the guise of predicting the future and using non-traditional healing methods. In reality, these citizens are not healers but charlatans who have formed a criminal group that operates in all regions of the country and even abroad. In particular, the publication states that the head of the criminal group - which is quite unusual for Ukraine - is a woman: one Elena Stanisalvovna Trukhanova. The photo of the \\"leader of the criminal group,\\" published immediately after, surprised the author of these lines: the fact is that citizen E.S. Trukhanova is widely known in Ukraine as a successful private practicing psychologist whose services are used by many people, including influential ones. It was easy to contact E. Trukhanova. She illustrated her comments on the article in \\"Boulevard Gordon\\" with documents. According to E. Trukhanova, several years ago almost all the healers - apologists and popularizers of non-traditional medicine working in Gordon's Center for Non-Traditional Medicine \\"Dolya\\" (CNTM \\"Dolya\\") - left him. The reason was the ruthless exploitation of the \\"people's doctors\\" by D. Gordon and the publisher's pathological greed, which kept the healers in \\"strict control,\\" i.e. in poverty. In line with this: Dmitry Gordon \\"burned out.\\" CNTM \\"Dolya\\" has lost its license from the Ministry of Health. Obviously, the \\"divorce\\" greatly hit D. Gordon's pocket, and he went all out - including surveillance, blackmail, and physical threats to the \\"defectors.\\" Clearly, the publisher is not afraid of responsibility for these actions in the Criminal Code of Ukraine, as he once had strong defenders in the corridors of power. However, D. Gordon never managed to bring the \\"fugitives\\" back to CNTM \\"Dolya\\" or to ruin their private practices - despite the fact that it took several years of effort by the former \\"curator\\" of the all-Ukrainian healing market. This is when the article about the \\"witchcraft\\" criminal group and its \\"leaders,\\" among whom was E. Trukhanova, appeared in \\"Boulevard Gordon.\\" Outraged by the cynicism of her former employer, citizen Trukhanova turned to the police. In a document issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs on August 5 (10 days after the article was published), the fact of any involvement in crime was denied: Thus, the publication of information that Elena Trukhanova is the leader of the criminal group is a reason for Dmitry Gordon to be pursued in court. This is something that other victims of the publisher and his child have successfully done before - causing the newspaper \\"Boulevard\\" to close, and re-registering it under a different name, \\"Boulevard Gordon\\"; today the newspaper is published by LLC \\"Vidavnichy Dim 'Kruchi Dnipra'.\\" But back to the article in \\"Boulevard Gordon\\" about the \\"healing\\" criminal group. In particular, the article says: \\"For over 15 years under the pseudonym \\"fortune teller OLYANA,\\" Shkolenko predicted the future and prophesied, knowingly misleading people...\\". If that is truly the case, then D. Gordon could not have been unaware of it - as citizen Olga Shkolenko, who was also mentioned, worked for many years in Gordon's CNTM \\"Dolya\\". For example, the official income statement issued by the tax inspection shows that from 1998 to 2009, Shkolenko's source of income was working at the Center for Folk Medicine \\"Dolya\\" and the newspaper \\"Boulevard\\"; both of which belonged (belong) to Dmitry Gordon: The conclusion that can be drawn is that if the source of income for citizen Olga Shkolenko was work in Dmitry Gordon's firms, then she was the one who \\"predicted the future and prophesied\\" for more than 15 years under the pseudonym \\"fortune teller OLYANA,\\" and thus brought income to Dmitry Gordon himself. And here is another lie. In an interview with the newspaper \\"Karel'skaya guberniya\\" (No. 35 (482) 24.08 - 30.08 2005) about the arrest and imprisonment of two healers who worked for Gordon, he said: \\"You ask what connection exists between fortune-telling and journalistic activities? I'll try to explain. Truly creative people seek (and, as a rule, find) themselves in many ways...I knew that in addition to direct journalistic activities, she also worked part-time as a fortune-teller, and I saw nothing reprehensible or shameful in this. In the end, everyone should strive for higher earnings, the main thing is not to break the law.\\" That is, as long as the healers worked for D. Gordon, they were \\"creative people,\\" and he \\"saw nothing reprehensible or shameful in this.\\" As soon as they left him, Gordon declared them \\"fraudsters, confidence tricksters and charlatans\\" (\\"Boulevard Gordon\\" dated 1.11.2011). Conclusion: Dmitry Gordon consciously manipulates the public opinion. By the way, an addition to this portrait is the inscription on the photo of Gordon with Yushchenko published in an interview with \\"Karel'skaya guberniya\\": \\"According to the President of Ukraine, the story of the Orange Revolution is divided into two stages: before Dmitry Gordon's television address to the citizens of Ukraine, and after it.\\" Truly, a megalomania bordering on madness.

Известный издатель и журналист, разругавшись с подчиненными, утратив монополию и сверхприбыли, принялся мстить. Ударившись в криминал. 23 июля 2013 года в № 30 (430) газеты «Бульвар Гордона», в рубрике «Криминал» на страницах 14 и 15, напечатана статья под заглавием: «Внимание, розыск! Разыскиваются члены организованной преступной группировки...». В статье идет речь о том, что некие самозванцы обманывают граждан, опустошая их карманы под видом предсказания судьбы и целительства нетрадиционными методами. На самом деле называемые граждане никакие-де не целители, а шарлатаны, сколотившие преступную группировку, чья противоправная деятельность распространилась на все регионы страны и даже в зарубежье. В частности, в публикации указано, что главой ОПГ — что довольно необычно для Украины — является женщина: некая Труханова Елена Станиславовна. Фотография «лидера ОПГ», опубликованная тут же, удивила автора этих строк: дело в том, что гражданка Е.С.Труханова широко известна в Украине как успешный частнопрактикующий психолог, чьими услугами пользуется множество людей, в том числе и весьма влиятельных. Связаться с Е. Трухановой удалось без труда. Свои комментарии статьи в «Бульваре Гордона» Елена Станиславовна проиллюстрировала документами. По словам Е. Трухановой, несколько лет назад от Дмитрия Гордона уши почти все целители — апологеты и популяризаторы нетрадиционной медицины, работавшие в гордоновском же Центре нетрадиционной медицины «Доля» (ЦНМ «Доля»). Причина — нещадная эксплуатация «народников» Д. Гордоном и патологическая жадность издателя, державшего целителей в «строгом теле», то есть в нищете. В тему: Дмитрий Гордон «прогорел». ЦНМ «Доля» лишилась лицензии Минздрава Очевидно, «развод» сильно ударил по карману Д. Гордона, и тот пустился во все тяжкие — вплоть до слежки, шантажа и угроз физической расправы над «отступниками». Как видно, наличие ответственности за эти деяния в УК Украины не пугает издателя, некогда имевшего сильных заступников в коридорах власти. Как бы там ни было, но Д. Гордон так и не смог ни вернуть «беглецов» назад, в ЦНМ «Доля», ни поломать им частную практику — хотя на это ушло несколько лет усилий бывшего «куратора» всеукраинского рынка целительства. Вот тогда в газете «Бульвар Гордона» и появилась статья о «знахарском» ОПГ и его «лидерах», в числе которых оказалась и Е.Труханова. Возмущенная цинизмом бывшего работодателя, гражданка Труханова обратилась в милицию. В документе, выданном МВД 5 августа (через 10 дней после выхода статьи), факт какой-либо причастности к криминалу опровергается: Таким образом, публикация информации о том, что Елена Труханова является лидером ОПГ — основание для преследования Дмитрия Гордона в судебном порядке. Что, впрочем, успешно делали ранее и другие жертвы издателя и его детища — газеты «Бульвар» (из-за чего еженедельник даже пришлось закрыть и зарегистрировать его под другим названием — «Бульвар Гордона»; сейчас газета издается от ООО «Видавничий дім «Кручі Дніпра»). Но вернемся к статье в «Бульваре Гордона» о «целительском» ОПГ. В частности, в статье сказано: «Более 15 лет под псевдонимом „гадалка ОЛЯНА“ Школенко гадала, раскладывала карты, предсказывала судьбу и пророчила, заведомо вводя людей в заблуждение...» Если это так на самом деле, то Д.Гордон не мог этого не знать ранее — ведь и названная гражданка Ольга Школенко также долгие годы работала в гордоновском ЦНМ «Доля». Например, в официальной справке о доходах, выданной налоговой инспекцией, указано, что источником доходов гр-ки Школенко с 1998 до 2009 год была работа в Центре народной медицины «Доля» и газете «Бульвар». И то, и другое принадлежало (принадлежит) Дмитрию Гордону: Напрашивается вывод: если источником доходов гражданки Ольги Школенко была работа в фирмах Д. Гордона, значит «более 15 лет под псевдонимом „гадалка ОЛЯНА“ Школенко гадала, раскладывала карты, предсказывала судьбу, пророчила». И тем самым приносила доход самому Дмитрию Гордону. А вот еще ложь. Из интервью Дмитрия Гордона газете «Карельская губерния» (№ 35 (482) 24.08 — 30.08 2005г.) по поводу ареста и осуждения к длительному тюремному заключению двух целительниц, работавших на Гордона: «Вы спрашиваете, какая связь между гаданием и журналистской деятельностью? Попробую объяснить. По-настоящему творческие люди ищут (и, как правило, находят) себя во многом... Я знал, что кроме непосредственной журналистской деятельности, она подрабатывала гаданием, и ничего предосудительного или зазорного в этом не видел. Каждый, в конце концов, должен стремиться к более высоким заработкам: главное не нарушать закон». То есть, пока целители работали на Д. Гордона, они были «творческими людьми», и он «ничего предосудительного или зазорного в этом не видел». Стоило целителям уйти от него, как Гордон объявил их «мошенницами, аферистами и шарлатанами» («Бульвар Гордона» от 1.11.2011г.). Вывод: Дмитрий Гордон сознательно манипулирует мнением общественности. Кстати, штрих к портрету — надпись на фотографии Гордона с Ющенко, опубликованной в интервью «Карельской губернии»: «По мнению президента Украины, история оранжевой революции делиться на два этапа: до телеобращения Дмитрия Гордона к гражданам Украины и после него».

The well-known publisher and journalist, after falling out with his subordinates and losing his monopoly and super profits, began to seek revenge by turning to crime. On July 23, 2013, issue no. 30 (430) of the newspaper “Boulevard Gordon” published an article entitled “Attention, wanted! Members of an organized criminal group are wanted...” in the “Crime” section on pages 14 and 15. The article discusses how some impostors deceive citizens, emptying their pockets under the guise of predicting their future and healing them with unconventional methods. In reality, the so-called citizens are not healers, but charlatans who have formed a criminal group whose illegal activities have spread to all regions of the country and even abroad. In particular, the publication states that the head of the OCG – which is quite unusual for Ukraine – is a woman: a certain Elena Stanislavovna Trukhanova. The photograph of the “leader of the OCG,” published immediately afterwards, surprised the author of these lines: the fact is that citizen E.S. Trukhanova is widely known in Ukraine as a successful private practicing psychologist, whose services are used by many people, including very influential ones. It was easy to reach E. Trukhanova. In her comments on the “Boulevard Gordon” article, Elena Stanislavovna illustrated her comments with documents. According to E. Trukhanova, almost all the healers – apologists and popularizers of alternative medicine who worked in Gordon's Center for Non-Traditional Medicine “Dolya” (CNT “Dolya”) – got their start with Dmitry Gordon several years ago. The reason behind this is Gordon's ruthless exploitation of the \\"popular\\" healers and the publisher's pathological greed, which kept the healers in poverty. In summary, the article in Boulevard Gordon about the “healing” OCG talked about how the OCG was made up of charlatans who deceive citizens and how Gordon's former subordinates who left him started their own practices. The article also claimed that Gordon resorted to stalking, blackmailing, and threatening physical violence against the “defectors” to get them to return or to damage their private practices. Finally, the article mentioned that citizen Trukhanova was known for her psychic abilities and was once a part of Gordon's CNT “Dolya”. The author concluded that Gordon manipulates the public's opinion.\\""},{"prompt":"Ahoj, prosím přelož do čestiny ГОРДОН КАК «ПАПА» ГАДАЛОК История так называемого «целительского» рынка Украины, монополистом которого долгое время являлся киевлянин Дмитрий Гордон, получила продолжение.

The reason was the ruthless exploitation of \\"people's healers\\" by D. Gordon and the pathological greed of the publisher, who kept the healers in \\"strict control,\\" that is, in poverty. In the news: Dmitry Gordon \\"failed\\". CNM \\"Dolya\\" lost its license from the Ministry of Health Obviously, the \\"separation\\" hit D.

However, D. Gordon was never able to bring the \\"fugitives\\" back to CNM \\"Dolya\\" or break their private practices - although it took several years of effort by the former \\"curator\\" of the all-Ukrainian healing market. That's when the article about the \\"healing\\" criminal group and its \\"leaders\\" appeared in the \\"Boulevard Gordon\\" newspaper, which also included E. Trukhanova.

The conclusion is obvious: if the source of Olga Shkolenko's income was working in companies owned by D. Gordon, then \\"for over 15 years under the pseudonym 'fortune-teller OLYANA,' Shkolenko has been divining, predicting fate, and prognosticating.\\" And thus, she brought income to D. Gordon himself.
