Answer a question about this article: In each case, cables are attached to a hitch plate on top of the cab or may be \\"underslung\\" below a cab, and then looped over the drive sheave to a counterweight attached to the opposite end of the cables which reduces the amount of power needed to move the cab. The counterweight is located in the hoist-way and rides a separate railway system; as the car goes up, the counterweight goes down, and vice versa. This action is powered by the traction machine which is directed by the controller, typically a relay logic or computerized device that directs starting, acceleration, deceleration and stopping of the elevator cab. The weight of the counterweight is typically equal to the weight of the elevator cab plus 40-50% of the capacity of the elevator. The grooves in the drive sheave are specially designed to prevent the cables from slipping. \\"Traction\\" is provided to the ropes by the grip of the grooves in the sheave, thereby the name. As the ropes age and the traction grooves wear, some traction is lost and the ropes must be replaced and the sheave repaired or replaced. Sheave and rope wear may be significantly reduced by ensuring that all ropes have equal tension, thus sharing the load evenly. Rope tension equalization may be achieved using a rope tension gauge, and is a simple way to extend the lifetime of the sheaves and ropes. The counterweight runs equal to the cab weight plus what percentage of the elevator capacity?","completion":"The counterweight runs equal to the cab weight plus 40-50% of the elevator capacity. This balance helps reduce the amount of power needed to move the elevator cab, as the counterweight moves in the opposite direction of the cab when it is in operation (i.e., when the cab goes up, the counterweight goes down, and vice versa). By having the counterweight's weight set to approximately the weight of the cab plus a percentage of its capacity, the system can optimize its performance and efficiently transfer the forces generated during the cab's movement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is?","completion":"Epistaxis, a medical term that might seem unfamiliar to many, is more commonly known as a \\"nosebleed.\\" Nosebleeds can manifest in individuals of any age and are a relatively frequent occurrence. There are two types of nosebleeds: anterior and posterior. Anterior nosebleeds are the most common and typically originate in the lower part of the nasal septum, which is the cartilage dividing the two nostrils. This area contains many delicate blood vessels that can be easily damaged, leading to a nosebleed. Common causes for such damage include dry air, nose picking, and nasal irritation from allergies, colds, or sinus infections. Posterior nosebleeds, on the other hand, are less common and tend to affect older individuals or those with high blood pressure. These nosebleeds arise in the deeper parts of the nasal cavity and are generally more severe, often requiring medical attention. Several factors can contribute to the occurrence of nosebleeds. Some of these factors are environmental, such as exposure to dry air or extremely cold temperatures, while others are lifestyle-related, such as the use of nasal decongestants or antihistamines, smoking, or alcohol consumption. Furthermore, certain medical conditions and treatments, like blood thinners, can increase the risk of nosebleeds. While most nosebleeds are harmless and can be managed at home by pinching the nostrils together and leaning slightly forward, it is crucial to seek medical help if the bleeding is excessive or persistent, or if it's accompanied by additional symptoms like difficulty breathing, dizziness, or pain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From 2010 to 2012, he was president of The King's College, a Christian school in New York City. Born in Bombay, D'Souza came to the United States as an exchange student and graduated from Dartmouth College. He became a naturalized citizen in 1991. On July 25, 2016, D'Souza released the documentary film Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party. The film criticizes the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, the presumptive (and ultimate) Democratic nominee for President of the United States in 2016. The film was universally panned by professional film critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 4%, based on 27 professional reviews, with an average rating of 1.7/10. The critics consensus on the site reads, \\"Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party finds Dinesh D'Souza once again preaching to the right-wing choir--albeit less effectively than ever.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 2 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". The film has the fifth lowest score of all films on the site. Peter Sobczynski wrote, \\"Hillary's America may well be the single dumbest documentary that I have ever seen in my life.\\" A July 2016 review in Variety characterized D'Souza as \\"a right-wing conspiracy wingnut, the kind of \\"thinker\\" who takes off from Barack Obama birther theories and just keeps going, spinning out a web of comic-book liberal evil.\\" Other critics and figures viewed the film positively. John Fund of the National Review stated that \\"[the film] is over the top in places and definitely selective, but the troubling facts are accurate and extensively documented in the D'Souza book that accompanies the movie.\\" He also called the film \\"intensely patriotic\\". On July 23, 2016, Donald Trump, who was then running as the Republican presidential nominee against Clinton, called on supporters to see the film. On January 23, 2017 the film was nominated for five Razzies including: Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Dinesh D'Souza), Worst Actress (Becky Turner), Worst Director (Dinesh D'Souza and Bruce Schooley), and Worst Screenplay. In response to the Razzie nominations, D'Souza stated that he was \\"actually quite honored\\" and called the nominations \\"petty revenge\\" in response to Trump's election victory, also stating that \\"the film might have played an important role in the election.\\" After \\"winning\\" four of the five possible Razzies, D'Souza repeated his view that the nominations were awarded in response to Trump's election victory.

At the same time, Nelson was gaining clout within Rockefeller Center Inc., and he disagreed with nearly all of Todd's suggestions. Nelson's father, John, was relinquishing his responsibilities, since the Rockefeller family's youngest son David had moved out of the family home at 10 West 54th Street, and John was now focusing on his own personal life. By April 1937, Todd regretted his decision to be featured in The New Yorker. In March 1938, Nelson became the president of Rockefeller Center Inc. He then fired Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. Nelson and Robertson wanted to avoid workers' strikes, which would delay the completion of construction. Nelson, Robertson, and the workers' unions agreed to a contract in which the unions would not strike, Robertson would not lock out union workers, and both would agree to arbitration if a labor dispute arose.

Answer:","completion":"The Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center is located in Norman, Oklahoma, which is a city in the United States. To formulate an answer to the question of how many inhabitants were living in Norman, Oklahoma, in 2015, we must turn to historical population data. According to the United States Census Bureau, the population of Norman, Oklahoma, in 2015 was approximately 120,284 inhabitants. This figure is based on census data and population estimates that are produced by the Census Bureau to provide annual growth data between decennial censuses. It is crucial to be aware that the population of a city is fluid and changes over time due to various factors, such as births, deaths, and migration patterns. Therefore, while the population of Norman, Oklahoma, was 120,284 in 2015, it has likely changed since then. The Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center, as an institution, is a part of the University of Oklahoma and was established in 1979. It is named after the late Carl Albert, who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Oklahoma, and as the Speaker of the House from 1971 to 1977. The Center is a non-partisan learning facility that focuses on contributing to the understanding of Congress, its members, and the legislative process. It also hosts several programs and resources, including a significant collection of historical Congressional papers. The city of Norman, where the center is located, is the third-largest city in Oklahoma and is part of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area. It is home to the University of Oklahoma, which is one of the leading public research universities in the state. Norman has a vibrant and diverse community, thanks in part to the university's significant influence. This city also enjoys various cultural events, recreational activities, and educational opportunities, making it a great place for residents and visitors alike. In conclusion, the Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center is located in Norman, Oklahoma, which had a population of around 120,284 inhabitants in 2015, according to the United States Census Bureau. The center is an essential institution for the study of the U.S. Congress and legislative processes and is situated in a thriving city that offers a host of diverse experiences for its residents and visitors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Old Occitan generally includes Early and Old Occitan. Middle Occitan is sometimes included in Old Occitan, sometimes in Modern Occitan. As the term \\"occitanus\\" appeared around the year 1300, Old Occitan is referred to as \\"Romance\\" (Occitan: \\"romans\\") or \\"Provençal\\" (Occitan: \\"proensals\\") in medieval texts. - The trobairises (singular: trobairitz) were Occitan female troubadours of the 12th and 13th centuries, active from around 1170 to approximately 1260. The word \\"trobairitz\\" was first used in the 13th-century romance \\"Flamenca\\". It comes from the Provençal word \\"trobar\\", the literal meaning of which is \\"to find\\", and the technical meaning of which is \\"to compose\\". The word \\"trobairitz\\" is used very rarely in medieval Occitan, as it does not occur in lyrical poetry, grammatical treatises, or in the biographies of the \\"trobairitz\\" or troubadours. \\"Trobairitz\\" composed, wrote verses, and performed for the Occitan noble courts. They are exceptional in musical history as the first known female composers of Western secular music; all earlier known female composers wrote sacred music. The \\"trobairitz\\" were part of courtly society, as opposed to their lower class counterparts the \\"joglaressas\\".

The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits. The city is both a commune and department, and forms the centre and headquarters of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an area of and a population in 2014 of 12,005,077, comprising 18.2 percent of the population of France. - Aude is a department in south-central France named after the river Aude. The local council also calls the department \\"Cathar Country\\". Aude is also a frequent feminine French given name in Francophone countries, deriving initially from Aude or Oda, a wife of Bertrand, Duke of Aquitaine, and mother of Saint Hubertus's brother Eudo. Aude was the name of Roland's fiancée in the chansons de geste. - A troubadour was a composer and performer of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages (11001350). Since the word \\"troubadour\\" is etymologically masculine, a female troubadour is usually called a trobairitz. - Lyric poetry is a formal type of poetry which expresses personal emotions or feelings, typically spoken in the first person. The term derives from a form of Ancient Greek literature, the lyric, which was defined by its musical accompaniment, usually on a stringed instrument known as a lyre. The term owes its importance in literary theory to the division developed by Aristotle between three broad categories of poetry: lyrical, dramatic and epic. - Narbonne (Occitan: \\"Narbona\\") is a commune in southern France in the Occitanie region. It lies from Paris in the Aude department, of which it is a sub-prefecture. Once a prosperous port, and a major city in Roman times, it is now located about from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. It is marginally the largest commune in Aude, although the prefecture is the slightly smaller commune of Carcassonne. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - A minstrel was a medieval European entertainer. Originally describing any type of entertainer such as a musician, juggler, acrobat, singer or fool, the term later, from the sixteenth century, came to mean a specialist entertainer who sang songs and played musical instruments. - Peire Rogier ( born c. 1145 ) was a twelfth - century Auvergnat troubadour ( fl . 1160 -- 1180 ) and cathedral canon from Clermont . He left his cathedral to become a travelling minstrel before settling down for a time in Narbonne at the court of the Viscountess Ermengard . His life and career are known because his late thirteenth - century vida survives , as well as some of his works . The reliability of his vida , upon which all the details of his goings and comings are known , however , is not complete . According to it , he left the religious life to become a jongleur . He fell in love with his hostess and patron and wrote many songs in her honour , giving Ermengard the nickname Tort - n'avetz ( \`\` You are wrong '' ) , but for what reasons is unknown . Eventually the people of the Narbonnaise believed that he was in a sexual relationship with the viscountess and so she asked him to leave . He moved on to the court of Raimbaut d'Aurenga , where he also remained for a long time . From Raimbaut 's court he moved on to sojourn at that of Alfonso VIII of Castile , then that of Alfonso II of Aragon , and finally that of Raymond V of Toulouse , where he arrived circa 1170 . According to his vida , he became much esteemed as a troubadour through his travels , but there is no evidence otherwise for any movements in Spain , except perhaps the assembly of troubadours at the court of Aragon mentioned in a work of Peire d'Alvernhe ( which need not have taken place ) . He entered the Order of Grandmont before his death . Peire Rogier 's style of courtly love poetry is of the extremely reverent variety , in which the man submits completely to his lady and she is a paragon of virtue and courtliness ( though the word cortezia is absent from his surviving works ) . She can by mere words convert a boorish man into a courtly one . Love need not be physical to be enjoyed and suffering on behalf of one 's lady is considered pleasure .

Troubadours are known to be composers and performers of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages.

How do you do this: One wants to remove rust from a metal object.","completion":"To remove rust from a metal object effectively, you should follow these steps: 1. Gather required materials: Before beginning the rust removal process, ensure you have the necessary materials for the job. These may include: - A wire brush or steel wool - Sandpaper (with varying grit sizes) - White vinegar - Baking soda - Lemon or lime juice - A bowl or container large enough to submerge the rusted object - Protective gloves and eyewear - An old toothbrush or a soft cloth - Rust converter, rust remover, or rust inhibitor products (optional) 2. Assess the rusted object: Determine the severity of rusting on the metal object. There may be surface rust, a flaking/crusting rust, or deep rust that has penetrated the metal. Knowing the extent of rust will help you choose which method to apply. 3. Choose the appropriate rust removal method: - Surface rust: For minor surface rust, you can use a combination of mechanical and chemical rust removal processes. Start by gently scrubbing the rusted areas with a wire brush, steel wool, or sandpaper (beginning with a coarser grit and working your way down to the finer grit). Once most of the rust has been removed, you can move on to using some white vinegar or lemon/lime juice to neutralize any remaining rust. - Flaking/crusting rust: Begin by using a wire brush or steel wool to remove the flaking rust. If more force is needed, use a hammer and chisel to break away large chunks of rust. Once the majority of the rust has been chipped away, you can use a rust converter or rust remover product according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, you can use a vinegar or lemon/lime juice soak to treat any remaining rust. - Deep rust: Depending on the depth of the rust and the value of the object, consider professional help or replacing the item. If you choose to remove the rust by yourself, you may need to use a heavy-duty rust remover product or an electrolysis setup. Electrolysis involves connecting a car battery charger and a sacrificial metal to the rusted object submerged in an electrolyte solution. This setup creates a reaction that draws the rust out of the metal object and onto the sacrificial metal. 4. Chemical treatment: If you chose to use vinegar or lemon/lime juice, soak the rusted metal object in the liquid for several hours or overnight. Ensure the object is fully submerged. The acidic properties will help dissolve the rust. After soaking, remove the object and scrub it gently with an old toothbrush or a soft cloth to remove any leftover rust. 5. Rinse and neutralize: After the rust has been removed, rinse the metal object with water to remove any remaining vinegar or lemon/lime juice. To neutralize the acid, mix a solution of baking soda and water (approximately one tablespoon of baking soda per cup of water) and soak the metal item for 10-15 minutes, then rinse with water again. 6. Dry and protect: Dry the metal object thoroughly to prevent the formation of new rust. Once it is completely dry, you can apply a rust inhibitor, light oil, or a coat of protective paint to protect the surface and prevent future rusting. Remember to dispose of any waste materials responsibly, following local guidelines, and consider recycling when possible."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer this question. “Harlequin” is the first book in a series about a quest for which item?","completion":"\\"Harlequin\\" is the first book in the Grail Quest series written by esteemed British author Bernard Cornwell. The Grail Quest series is a historical fiction that revolves around the quest for the Holy Grail, which is a significant symbol in Christian mythology. The Holy Grail is traditionally thought to be the dish, plate, or cup used by Jesus at the Last Supper, said to possess miraculous powers. According to Arthurian literature, the elusive Holy Grail was the cup used by Joseph of Arimathea to catch and store the blood of Christ at the Crucifixion. The grail became a focal point in tales of King Arthur and his knights, who were portrayed as embarking on a spiritual and physical pursuit to find and protect this sacred object, which was thought to hold divine powers, including the power to heal all wounds, grant eternal youth or sustenance in infinite abundance. In Bernard Cornwell's Grail Quest series, the main character is an English longbowman named Thomas of Hookton. Thomas becomes entangled in this historic quest for the Holy Grail during the turbulent time of the Hundred Years War between England and France. Thomas's personal connection to the Holy Grail is what drives him into this quest. After his village was slaughtered by a renegade group of raiders who also stole his father's religious artifact which Thomas believes might connect him with the Holy Grail, he joins the English army and embarks on the quest himself. Throughout the series, Thomas battles against the forces of his own king, rival claimants, and the Church while dodging danger and deception at every turn. His courage, his skill as an archer, and his own semi-heretical belief that the Grail is a force for good separate from the established Church, all fuel his single-handed quest for this mythic object. Therefore, Bernard Cornwell's \\"Harlequin\\" (known as \\"The Archer's Tale\\" in the United States), as the very start of this series, sets the groundwork for a thrilling narrative, centered around a multi-layered, centuries-old quest for the Holy Grail. It effectively sets the tone for the successive books in the series, propelling the reader into the cataclysmic conflicts of historical Europe, all told from the perspective of a singular archer who holds the clue to Christianity's greatest relic."},{"prompt":"Question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Joel loved cosplay .; [2]. Joseph loved cosplay .;","completion":"[1]. Joel loved cosplay . Ever since he was a child, Joel had been fascinated by the art of cosplay. Growing up, he found solace in attending various conventions, meticulously crafting costumes and becoming lost in the worlds of his favorite characters. For Joel, cosplay was more than just a hobby; it was a way to celebrate the magic of storytelling, connect with like-minded individuals, and escape from the mundaneness of everyday life. Joseph, on the other hand, had never been intrigued by the phenomenon of cosplay. He preferred to express his love for the fictional realm through writing or discussing the subject matter with others. To him, cosplay seemed slightly too dramatic and outside of his comfort zone. One day, Joel came across an advertisement for the upcoming \\"NebulaCon,\\" a massive convention meant for fans of science fiction, fantasy, and all things geeky. His heart began to race with excitement, and a plan quickly formed in his mind. He would attend the convention with his best friend Joseph and would create the perfect costume for them to go together. Joel's imagination ignited as he began brainstorming ideas for the perfect pair of costumes. He wanted something iconic, unique, and timeless. The idea hit him one evening while browsing through some old promotional posters from beloved sci-fi movies. Joel would dress as the courageous and powerful Princess Leia from Star Wars, while Joseph would become the lovable rogue Han Solo. When Joel shared his exciting costume idea with Joseph, the response was less than enthusiastic. Joseph hesitated, reminding Joel of his aversion to cosplay and expressing concerns about drawing unnecessary attention to himself. Despite his reservations, Joseph didn't want to let his friend down and chose to support Joel's passion by accompanying him to the convention—but insisted on wearing 'normal clothes' instead of engaging in cosplay. On the day of the convention, Joel awoke early with boundless enthusiasm as he donned his meticulously crafted Princess Leia costume. He had spent countless hours perfecting every minute detail to truly embody the iconic character. Meanwhile, Joseph stood by and watched, equally nervous and excited about the day's festivities. As they arrived at NebulaCon, Joel's presence was met with admiration and awe from fellow fans. His Princess Leia costume was a hit among the attendees, and the convention floor buzzed with excitement and camaraderie. Although Joseph chose not to engage in cosplay, he couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and appreciation for the artistry and talent on display all around him. Throughout the day, Joel effortlessly transitioned between fan-turned-photographer, posing for photos with excited fellow cosplayers, and an enthralled bystander as he soaked in the myriad of panels, workshops, and vendors that NebulaCon had to offer. As the convention came to a close, Joel and Joseph found themselves standing outside the entrance, reminiscing on their shared experiences and newfound camaraderie amongst the fans. With a renewed sense of appreciation for his friend's passion, Joseph began to contemplate the idea of participating in cosplay at the next convention. He realized that transcending the boundaries of reality, even if just for a brief moment, could be a liberating and thrilling experience. And thus, Joel's love for cosplay opened Joseph's eyes to a new world of creativity and self-expression that had been hidden in plain sight. The seed of change had been planted—perhaps, one day, Joseph would embrace his own inner Princess Leia or Han Solo, and the two friends would embark on even more extraordinary adventures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Q: The documented history of malaria in parts of Asia goes back more than 2,000 years, during which the disease has been a major player on the socioeconomic stage in many nation states as they waxed and waned in power and prosperity. On a much shorter time scale, the last half century has seen in microcosm a history of large fluctuations in endemicity and impact of malaria across the spectrum of rice fields and rain forests, mountains and plains that reflect the vast ecological diversity inhabited by this majority aggregation of mankind. That period has seen some of the most dramatic changes in social and economic structure, in population size, density and mobility, and in political structure in history: all have played a part in the changing face of malaria in this extensive region of the world. While the majority of global malaria cases currently reside in Africa, greater numbers inhabited Asia earlier this century before malaria programs savored significant success, and now Asia harbors a global threat in the form of the epicenter of multidrug resistant Plasmodium falciparum which is gradually encompassing the tropical world. The latter reflects directly the vicissitudes of economic change over recent decades, particularly the mobility of populations in search of commerce, trade and personal fortunes, or caught in the misfortunes of physical conflicts. The period from the 1950s to the 1990s has witnessed near \\"eradication\\" followed by resurgence of malaria in Sri Lanka, control and resurgence in India, the influence of war and postwar instability on drug resistance in Cambodia, increase in severe and cerebral malaria in Myanmar during prolonged political turmoil, the essential disappearance of the disease from all but forested border areas of Thailand where it remains for the moment intractable, the basic elimination of vivax malaria from many provinces of central China. Both positive and negative experiences have lessons to teach in the debate between eradication and control as alternative strategies. China has for years held high the goal of \\"basic elimination\\", eradication by another name, in sensible semi-defiance of WHO dictates. The Chinese experience makes it clear that, given community organization, exhaustive attention to case detection, management and focus elimination, plus the political will at all levels of society, it is possible both to eliminate malaria from large areas of an expansive nation and to implement surveillance necessary to maintain something approaching eradication status in those areas. But China has not succeeded in the international border regions of the tropical south where unfettered population movement confounds the program. Thailand, Malaysia and to an extent Vietnam have also reached essential elimination in their rice field plains by vigorous vertical programs but fall short at their forested borders. Economics is central to the history of the rise and fall of nations, and to the history of disease in the people who constitute nations. The current love affair with free market economics as the main driving force for advance of national wealth puts severe limitations on the essential involvement of communities in malaria management. The task of malaria control or elimination needs to be clearly related to the basic macroeconomic process that preoccupies governments, not cloistered away in the health sector Historically malaria has had a severe, measurable, negative impact on the productivity of nations. Economic models need rehoning with political aplomb and integrating with technical and demographic strategies. Recent decades in Chinese malaria history carry some lessons that may be relevant in this context.

Answer based on context: The Cowboys hosted the Saints in their annual Thanksgiving Day game. The Cowboys trailed early with RB Chris Ivory getting a 3-yard TD run, followed by kicker Garrett Hartley getting a 50-yard field goal, and then by Ivory making a 6-yard TD run. The Cowboys cut the lead as kicker David Buehler got a 21-yard field goal, but the Saints replied as Hartley nailed a 45-yard field goal. The Cowboys tried to come back as Buehler hit a 53-yard field goal, followed by Miles Austin getting a 60-yard TD run.

Mark tackled the quarterback, but he was penalized.","completion":"In the given sentence, \\"Mark tackled the quarterback, but he was penalized,\\" the pronoun \\"he\\" is referring to Mark. Here's a detailed explanation of the sentence and how we can deduce the antecedent of the pronoun: The sentence contains two clauses: 1. \\"Mark tackled the quarterback\\" - This clause describes an action performed by Mark, where he tackled the quarterback. 2. \\"he was penalized\\" - This clause describes a consequence (a penalty) that someone is facing. For understanding who \\"he\\" is referring to, we need to analyze the context. The context of the sentence is a football game in which a player named Mark tackles the quarterback. In football, penalties are usually given to the player who commits a foul or breaks a rule. In this case, given that the sentence connects the two clauses using \\"but,\\" it implies that although Mark performed the action (tackling the quarterback), he experienced a consequence (being penalized). This connection and the structure of the sentence indicate that the pronoun \\"he\\" is referring to Mark, the one who encountered a penalty as a result of his action. So, to sum up, \\"he\\" in the sentence \\"Mark tackled the quarterback, but he was penalized\\" refers to Mark, as he was the one who faced a penalty due to his action of tackling the quarterback."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In 1973, Cave met Mick Harvey (guitar), Phill Calvert (drums), John Cochivera (guitar), Brett Purcell (bass), and Chris Coyne (saxophone); fellow students at Caulfield Grammar. They founded a band with Cave as singer. Their repertoire consisted of proto-punk cover versions of songs by Lou Reed, David Bowie, Alice Cooper, Roxy Music and Alex Harvey, among others. Later, the line-up slimmed down to four members including Cave's friend Tracy Pew on bass. In 1977, after leaving school, they adopted the name The Boys Next Door and began playing predominantly original material. Guitarist and songwriter Rowland S. Howard joined the band in 1978. They were a leader of Melbourne's post-punk scene in the late 1970s, playing hundreds of live shows in Australia before changing their name to the Birthday Party in 1980 and moving to London, then West Berlin. Cave's Australian girlfriend and muse Anita Lane accompanied them to London. The band were notorious for their provocative live performances which featured Cave shrieking, bellowing and throwing himself about the stage, backed up by harsh pounding rock music laced with guitar feedback. Cave utilised Old Testament imagery with lyrics about sin, debauchery and damnation. Cave's droll sense of humour and penchant for parody is evident in many of the band's songs, including \\"Nick the Stripper\\" and \\"King Ink\\". \\"Release the Bats\\", one of the band's most famous songs, was intended as an over-the-top \\"piss-take\\" on gothic rock, and a \\"direct attack\\" on the \\"stock gothic associations that less informed critics were wont to make\\". Ironically, it became highly influential on the genre, giving rise to a new generation of bands. After establishing a cult following in Europe and Australia, the Birthday Party disbanded in 1984. Howard and Cave found it difficult to continue working together and both were rather worn down from alcohol and drug use.

There is a limitation to this type of approach (,) though. If you find the lowest price on the best hotel in Honolulu at the height of the season, you will save money, but still have a very expensive vacation. Trying to get exactly what you want will generally be an expensive proposition, in travel and in life. The other approach is to be a true opportunist. This will be difficult for some of you, and entirely unacceptable to others. Nonetheless ,the travelers who get to travel the most, go to the widest variety of places, learn the most and do the most, are the opportunists. This will be true until you are so wealthy that you have no monetary (;)limits. The first time I went to Ecuador, I went there because it was cheap. If it wasn't, I would have had a great time--somewhere else. The trip lasted a month, and cost 1045, which included airfare and even the 130 fee for a guide to take me to the top or glacier covered Mount Chimborazo. I cut the cost by taking a bus from my home in Michigan to Miami, and back again when I returned from Ecuador. The round-trip ticket cost 158. The round-trip flight to Quito from Miami was only 256, because it was a courier (,) flight, which meant I signed for some luggage(car parts), and could only take carry-on luggage. Never did I feel deprived, or bored. I had a great time, eating wherever it was cheap and clean, doing all sorts of inexpensive, but interesting things, and traveling across the country to climb Chimborazo. I also met and fell in love with my wife Ana. Being an opportunist means you'll have just as much variety, and probably almost everything you want--eventually. You just have to stop trying to get exactly what you want exactly when you want it.

During the 1750s Messiah was performed increasingly at festivals and cathedrals throughout the country. Individual choruses and arias were occasionally extracted for use as anthems or motets in church services, or as concert pieces, a practice that grew in the 19th century and has continued ever since. After Handel's death, performances were given in Florence (1768), New York (excerpts, 1770), Hamburg (1772), and Mannheim (1777), where Mozart first heard it. For the performances in Handel's lifetime and in the decades following his death, the musical forces used in the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754 are thought by Burrows to be typical. A fashion for large-scale performances began in 1784, in a series of commemorative concerts of Handel's music given in Westminster Abbey under the patronage of King George III. A plaque on the Abbey wall records that \\"The Band consisting of DXXV [525] vocal & instrumental performers was conducted by Joah Bates Esqr.\\" In a 1955 article, Sir Malcolm Sargent, a proponent of large-scale performances, wrote, \\"Mr Bates ... had known Handel well and respected his wishes. The orchestra employed was two hundred and fifty strong, including twelve horns, twelve trumpets, six trombones and three pairs of timpani (some made especially large).\\" In 1787 further performances were given at the Abbey; advertisements promised, \\"The Band will consist of Eight Hundred Performers\\".In continental Europe, performances of Messiah were departing from Handel's practices in a different way: his score was being drastically reorchestrated to suit contemporary tastes. In 1786, Johann Adam Hiller presented Messiah with updated scoring in Berlin Cathedral. In 1788 Hiller presented a performance of his revision with a choir of 259 and an orchestra of 87 strings, 10 bassoons, 11 oboes, 8 flutes, 8 horns, 4 clarinets, 4 trombones, 7 trumpets, timpani, harpsichord and organ.

Irish chief air accident investigator Jurgen Whyte described the location of a signal as \\"hugely significant\\" and said he hoped the recorder was in or near the helicopter wreckage. \\"To get the signal is the big thing,\\" he told Irish broadcaster RTÉ. \\"We are now in what would be described as a football pitch and somewhere within that football pitch there is a very small tweeting, chirping sound and as we move around that field we hope to get closer and closer to it. \\"The likelihood is that the three missing persons may be within that area as well - so our focus is still on recovering the three crew members and we believe that by finding the recorder that will bring us closer to that goal.\\" Accident investigators from the UK have joined the search for the black box with specialised equipment to assist the operation. The Irish Navy, RNLI, police divers and fishing boats are searching the coast off Mayo. Captain Robert McCabe, Director of Operations and Navigation with the Commissioners of Irish Lights, said all the lighthouses in the area were in \\"full working order\\" on the morning of the incident. Capt McCabe added that aids to navigation at Blackrock Lighthouse were functioning properly at the time of the crash. The Irish coastguard asked the Irish Defence Forces to provide top cover for the fatal rescue mission at 22:06 on Monday, but its fixed-wing aircraft were not available, so Rescue 116 was deployed instead. The Irish Defence Forces added that at 01:45 on Tuesday, the Irish Air Corps logged an emergency request from the Irish coastguard \\"to provide an aircraft to conduct a search for a missing helicopter, Rescue 116\\". \\"The Air Corps initiated its recall plan and as a result was able to offer a Casa CN235 maritime patrol aircraft. That plane took off from Casement Aerodrome south of Dublin shortly before 04:30 Rescue teams are using sophisticated underwater equipment which picks up a faint chirp from the locator beacon on the flight recorder. It's in water about 40m deep and only about 50 or 60m from Blackrock which is a tall, rocky island topped by a lighthouse about 10 miles off the Mayo coast. The next stage is to pinpoint its exact location and then attempt to recover the device either by using an underwater robot or dive teams. There are two black boxes, one which records the engine and flight data and the other which captures the voice and radio communications and investigators hope they'll be able to retrieve the data to find out what happened in the final moments of the flight. The water conditions are described as difficult, there are very strong currents and the weather today could impede the search with large swells forecast The Irish naval ship, LÉ Eithne, is helping to co-ordinate the ongoing search and rescue operation. On Wednesday, civil defence volunteers carried out searches along the shore. Irish Transport Minister Shane Ross visited Blacksod in County Mayo and spoke to relatives of the crew. \\"It's a very, very devastating experience for them as can be expected,\\" he said. The Dublin-based helicopter crew had been assisting colleagues from Sligo in a rescue operation on a UK fishing vessel about 150km (95 miles) west of Eagle Island. They lost contact at about 01:00 local time on Tuesday on a refuelling journey to Blacksod. Capt Fitzpatrick was the mother of a young son and the most senior pilot with CHC which runs the contract to provide search and rescue services in the Republic of Ireland. R116 from Dublin was sent to help the Sligo aircraft communicate with the base at Malin, as the fishing boat was too far out for the first helicopter to stay within communication range. The Sligo crew picked up the fisherman, who had a serious hand injury, and transferred him to hospital. Shortly afterwards, communication was lost with the Dublin-based aircraft. Conditions were described as good when the helicopter lost contact on its final approach to Blacksod refuelling depot. It is the second fatal accident involving Irish Coastguard crew members over the past six months. In September 2016, volunteer Coastguard Caitriona Lucas died while assisting in a rescue operation off the County Clare coast. The mother-of-two was one of three crew members on board a rigid inflatable boat which flipped over during a search for a man near cliffs at Kilkee. Irish coastguard helicopters have been used for a number of operations in Northern Ireland.

Charles 'Chuck' Levine (Who is a chronic womanizer) and Lawrence 'Larry' Valentine (Who is a bachelor and trying to raise his children after his wife passed away some time ago) are two veteran New York City Firefighters. During a routine sweep of a burned building, a segment of floor collapses and Chuck almost dies. Larry rescues Chuck by shielding him from the falling debris. As he and Larry awaken at a hospital later, Chuck vows to repay his debt in any way possible. The incident prompts Larry to realize the fact that death can come for him at any moment, but he has difficulties naming his children as primary beneficiaries in his life insurance policy. Larry was given at least a year to change his beneficiaries but he was profusely mourning his wife, and left it too late. However, One of the ways suggested for him to do so is to get married. Inspired by a newspaper article about domestic partnerships, Larry asks Chuck to enter a civil union with him. Although at first Chuck declines, he is reminded of his debt to Larry and finally agrees.Chuck and Larry become domestic partners and Chuck becomes Larry's primary beneficiary in the event of his death. Soon, New York City investigators arrive to inquire about their partnership.

What is the density of a 64-g iron cube that displaces 8 mL of water?The answer is:","completion":"To find the density of a 64-g iron cube that displaces 8 mL of water, we need to use the formula for density, which is: Density = Mass / Volume First, let's break down the information we have: 1. Mass: The mass of the iron cube is given as 64 grams. 2. Volume: To find the volume of the cube, we can use the information about water displacement. When the iron cube is immersed in water, it displaces 8 mL of water. According to Archimedes' principle, the volume of the water displaced is equal to the volume of the object (in this case, the iron cube) that is immersed in the water. Therefore, the volume of the iron cube is 8 mL (or 8 cm³, since 1 mL equals 1 cm³). Now we can plug these values into the density formula: Density = Mass / Volume Density = 64 grams / 8 cm³ Density = 8 g/cm³ So, the density of the 64-g iron cube that displaces 8 mL of water is 8 grams per cubic centimeter (8 g/cm³)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - The carafe is filled with water - The water is poured into the machine at the back - Coffee beans are put into a grinder - The grinder is activated - A filter is put into the coffee maker - The ground coffee is put into the filter - Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out flavor - The top of the machine is closed - The power is turned on - The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose beans are more expensive happens, how will it affect MORE coffee being made. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"If coffee beans become more expensive, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that there would be an effect on the process of making more coffee. This effect could be direct or indirect, depending on how the price change influences the consumption, production, and supply chain of coffee beans. We'll examine various ways in which the higher price of coffee beans could affect the process of making more coffee. 1. Direct Effects: a) Consumers may purchase fewer coffee beans due to the higher price, leading to a reduction in the quantity of coffee being made at home or workplaces. This could result in consumers either drinking less coffee or seeking alternative sources of caffeine, such as tea or energy drinks. b) Coffee shops and cafés could also be affected by the higher coffee bean prices. They may increase the selling price of their coffee beverages to compensate for the increased cost of ingredients, which could lead to a reduction in coffee consumption if consumers become more price-sensitive. c) The higher cost of coffee beans could also have an impact on industrial coffee production. Coffee manufacturers might opt to reduce their production levels or cut back on the quality of coffee beans used to produce their products, which could affect the overall taste and quality of the final coffee products. 2. Indirect Effects: a) A reduction in coffee consumption due to higher prices may lead to changes in the coffee supply chain and industry. With lower demand, coffee growers might decide to cut back on production or even switch to alternative crops, resulting in even higher coffee bean prices and further affecting the process of making more coffee. b) The higher cost of coffee beans could lead to the development and increased popularity of coffee substitutes. For example, chicory or barley-based coffee alternatives may gain more traction in the market due to their lower price and similar flavor profile. c) An increase in the price of coffee beans may also drive innovation in the coffee industry. Coffee machine manufacturers could opt to create machines that use less coffee while still maintaining the same quality and flavor, or research could be conducted to develop new methods for producing coffee with lower prices, such as synthetic alternatives or genetically modified beans. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does suggest that the higher price of coffee beans would have both direct and indirect effects on the process of making more coffee. It can affect consumer behavior, production levels, supply chain dynamics, and the overall coffee industry. The extent to which this price increase influences the process of making more coffee would depend on numerous factors, including consumer sensitivity to price changes, the volatility of the coffee market, and the adaptability of the coffee industry itself."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, according to California regulations, excessive levels of copper (up to 3892 mg/kg; limit: 2500), lead (up to 8103 mg/kg; limit: 1000), nickel (up to 4797 mg/kg; limit: 2000), or silver (up to 721 mg/kg; limit: 500) render all except low-intensity yellow LEDs hazardous.\\" What is the answer to this question: Which LEDs are considered dangerous by a 2011 study?","completion":"According to the 2011 study, low-intensity red LEDs are considered dangerous because they have high levels of lead. Also, all other LEDs, except for low-intensity yellow ones, can be considered hazardous in California because they have excessive amounts of copper, lead, nickel, or silver."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The last castle built in England is not a straightforward question to answer, as it depends on how one defines a \\"castle.\\" Traditionally, castles were built as fortifications during the medieval times and served as the residences of powerful lords and nobility. This period lasted from the 11th to early 16th century. However, if we consider the broader definition of castles, which could also include fortified manor homes and follies, castles continued to be built in later centuries. With these distinctions in mind, the following castles can be considered as some of the last built in England: 1. Fort Belvedere, Surrey: Built between 1750 and 1755, Fort Belvedere was a Gothic-style fortified folly constructed by Sir William Chambers for King George II. The fort was built for purposes of leisure and entertainment rather than as a defensive structure. 2. Highclere Castle, Hampshire: Highclere Castle was built between 1839 and 1842 as a country house for the Herbert family, who hold the title Earl of Carnarvon. Designed by Sir Charles Barry, Highclere Castle is in a more Victorian architectural style. Today, it is best known as the filming location for the television series \\"Downton Abbey.\\" 3. Wray Castle, Cumbria: Wray Castle was built in 1840 by Dr. James Dawson, a retired Liverpool surgeon, as a private residence in a mock-Gothic style. The castle was later acquired by the National Trust and has since become a prominent tourist attraction. 4. Whitstable Castle, Kent: Originally built as Tankerton Tower in 1790, it was extensively renovated and extended by architect Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1859 to form a private residence known as Whitstable Castle. The castle is now open to the public and used for various activities and events. 5. Castell Coch, Wales: Built between 1875 and 1891, Castell Coch is a Gothic Revival-style castle designed by William Burges for the Marquess of Bute. Although technically in Wales, it is worth mentioning as it was built during a similar timeframe as the other castles mentioned above. The castle today is under the care of Cadw and is open to the public. It is worth noting that many older castles in England have been continuously renovated, restored, or expanded over the centuries. Thus, even though they may have been initially built during medieval times, their current appearance may reflect more recent architectural styles and designs. Ultimately, the answer to when the last castle was built in England depends on the criteria one uses to define a castle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sentence 1: About 90% of all tobacco produced in Canada is grown here. Sentence 2: About 90% of the tobacco produced in Canada is grown here. Step 1: Identify the key elements in each sentence. - Key elements in Sentence 1: 90%, all tobacco, Canada, grown here - Key elements in Sentence 2: 90%, tobacco, Canada, grown here Step 2: Compare the key elements. - Both sentences mention \\"90%\\" of tobacco. - Both sentences mention \\"Canada.\\" - Both sentences mention \\"grown here.\\" The only difference between the two sentences is that Sentence 1 includes \\"all tobacco\\" while Sentence 2 simply states \\"tobacco.\\" However, the fact that 90% of the tobacco is specified in both sentences, it can be assumed that the remaining 10% is not being discussed. Therefore, the usage of \\"all tobacco\\" does not change the meaning of the Sentence 1, as it is still referring to the majority (i.e., 90%) of tobacco produced in Canada.

Please answer the following question: What is the first name of the person that is asked to talk to Hortense about Feet? Answer the above question based on the context below: Broadway, New Year's Eve, 1928. A muckraking reporter, Waldo Winchester, frames four major stories during the wild New Year's Eve of 1928. We meet the players in a diner. The Brain, a gangster with multiple girlfriends, is accompanied by a gambler named Regret (after the only horse he ever placed a winning bet) and an outsider who (with his bloodhounds) is being treated to a meal. Feet Samuels (so named because of his big feet) is in love with a showgirl named Hortense Hathaway, who is tossed out of the diner because of an unsavory reputation. Feet plans to have one wild night before committing suicide, having sold his body in advance to a medical doctor. Harriet MacKyle, a sheltered but friendly socialite, makes arrangements with a smooth-talking fixer for a big party that night at her estate, where many of the players will later attend. She has an interest in the exciting but dangerous criminal element. A girl selling flowers comes in after Feet makes a full payment of a debt to the Brain, so the Brain offers 5 for a 5-cent flower, telling her to keep the change. But before he can leave, a hitman for the Brooklyn Mob stabs him. The wounded Brain tells his men to take him \\"home.\\" Unfortunately, his many girlfriends refuse to allow him in for various reasons. Feet gets involved in a high-stakes craps game. With considerable luck, he wins a massive payoff of money and jewelry. Regret suggests they find another game, but Feet reveals his plan to kill himself. Regret tries to talk him out of it, but Feet, sworn to see his last promise fulfilled, is adamant. Regret dials up the reporter, who is now at MacKyle's party, and asks him to talk to Hortense (his niece) and get her to realize Feet is smitten with her. Hortense must try to persuade Feet that she wants to quit her life as a lounge singer, move to New Jersey and raise a family. Regret, meanwhile, continues to be the world's unluckiest gambler, but showgirl Lovey Lou is in love with him anyway. Answer:","completion":"Waldo"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: with bc-yugoslavia church of england head urges forgiveness and hope in sarajevo Text:","completion":"The head of the Church of England has urged forgiveness and hope during a visit to Sarajevo, a poignant city that epitomizes the turmoil and difficulties that once reigned in the region formally known as Yugoslavia. The city, which bears deep scars even decades after the breakdown of Yugoslavia, is attempting to heal and build a better future. This church leader's visit, which aimed at fostering a message of compassion, reconciliation, and perseverance, is particularly resonant considering the locale's tumultuous past. Sarajevo – a city renowned for its cultural and religious diversity – was significantly hit during the Bosnian War (1992 to 1995) that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia. The war was marked by ethnic strife, which caused significant suffering and division among the country’s diverse population. Neighbors turned against each other, friends became foes, and the city was left with a legacy of splintered communities. Against this backdrop of historical pain and division, the Church of England's leader's visit offered a potent symbol of peace and reconciliation. The head of the Church, bearing a message of forgiveness, urged the city's individuals and communities to heal the past's wounds by pardicating in acts of forgiveness. This plea aligns with Christian principles concerning compassion and the healing power of forgiveness – principles that don't only pertain to individual transgressions but can also apply on a broader societal level. In his speech, the Church leader also conveyed a message of hope, encouraging the city to look beyond the hardships of the past towards a positive and more harmonious future. Such a vision will require the commitment of the entire community, transcending ethnic, religious, and cultural lines. He called for the city's diverse religions and communities to work together in grasping the hope for a renewed and peaceful Sarajevo. This was an appeal to the city's deep roots of multiculturalism - a feature that before the war, was a beacon of co-existence and unity. Furthermore, the church leader emphasized the importance of education in building this hopeful future. By learning from the past, he suggested, future generations could prevent history from repeating itself, fostering understanding, peace, and unity. Overall, the Church of England's head visit to Sarajevo sent a strong message of forgiveness, hope, and unity. He reminded the city that they could not change the past, but they could decide their future. His speech was a call to action for Sarajevo and, indeed, for the world, suggesting that reconciliation and peace are possible even in the face of deep-rooted conflict and hardship. In the wake of his visit, the call for forgiveness and unity in Sarajevo echoes far and wide, not only in Yugoslavia but across the world as an example of the healing power of forgiveness and the unifying force of hope. The Church of England's leader's visit and his message serve as a reminder to all of us that we have the power to forge our future, however tangled our past may be."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"if a species is rare, harm to it's population increases or decreases?\\" is \\"pesticides\\", given that the rarity of a species increases harm to population exponentially? A:","completion":"The given answer, \\"pesticides,\\" does not directly address the question of whether harm to a rare species' population increases or decreases. However, we can analyze the question and discuss the potential impact of pesticides as well. The rarity of a species can be linked to increased harm to its population in various ways. For example, rare species might have limited habitat availability, low genetic diversity, and small population size, which could make them more vulnerable to threats like habitat loss, disease, or other external factors. Regarding pesticides, their impact on a species can be context-specific. Pesticides can negatively affect rare species if they are sensitive to the chemicals used, if their preferred habitat is frequently sprayed, or if their primary food sources are affected. For example, pesticides could harm pollinators like bees and butterflies, which might lead to a decline in the availability of food sources for other species. In some cases, pesticides might not directly affect a rare species, but their application could lead to a decrease in their population indirectly. For example, by eliminating certain types of plants, pesticides can remove essential habitat or food resources for rare species. In conclusion, the rarity of a species could result in increased harm to its population, particularly if they face additional threats like habitat loss, diseases, or the use of pesticides. However, the direct answer to the question is not \\"pesticides,\\" but rather an explanation that the rarity of a species can increase the harm to its population due to various factors, including but not limited to pesticides."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They are the descendants of free blacks and of escaped slaves (called maroons) who allied with Seminole groups in Spanish Florida. Historically, the Black Seminoles lived mostly in distinct bands near the Native American Seminole. Some were held as slaves of particular Seminole leaders; but they had more freedom than did slaves held by whites in the South and by other Native American tribes, including the right to bear arms. Throughout the period, several hundred Black Seminoles remained in the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). Because most of the Seminole and the other Five Civilized Tribes supported the Confederacy during the American Civil War, in 1866 the US required new peace treaties with them. The US required the tribes emancipate any slaves and extend to the freedmen full citizenship rights in the tribes if they chose to stay in Indian Territory. In the late nineteenth century, Seminole Freedmen thrived in towns near the Seminole communities on the reservation. Most had not been living as slaves to the Indians before the war. They lived --as their descendants still do-- in and around Wewoka, Oklahoma, the community founded in 1849 by John Horse as a black settlement. Today it is the capital of the federally recognized Seminole Nation of Oklahoma. Following the Civil War, some Freedmen's leaders in Indian Territory practiced polygyny, as did ethnic African leaders in other diaspora communities. In 1900 there were 1,000 Freedmen listed in the population of the Seminole Nation in Indian Territory, about one-third of the total. By the time of the Dawes Rolls, there were numerous female-headed households registered. The Freedmen's towns were made up of large, closely connected families. After allotment, \\"[f]reedmen, unlike their [Indian] peers on the blood roll, were permitted to sell their land without clearing the transaction through the Indian Bureau. That made the poorly educated Freedmen easy marks for white settlers migrating from the Deep South.\\" Numerous Seminole Freedmen lost their land in the early decades after allotment, and some moved to urban areas. Others left the state because of its conditions of racial segregation. As US citizens, they were exposed to the harsher racial laws of Oklahoma. Since 1954, the Freedmen have been included in the constitution of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma. They have two bands, each representing more than one town and named for 19th-century band leaders: the Cesar Bruner band covers towns south of Little River; the Dosar Barkus covers the several towns located north of the river. Each of the bands elects two representatives to the General Council of the Seminole Nation.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was their Indian territory?","completion":"The Black Seminoles' Indian territory was present-day Oklahoma.

On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year.

They also create a little waste, like when we get sweaty after running. Some bacteria are like superheroes that can change their powers based on what they need. These are called facultative anaerobes. Facultative anaerobes can switch between using fermentation and using oxygen, depending on what's available.

Soon, there were 60 students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona.

What is the best way to: Separate an egg using a plastic water bottle","completion":"Separating an egg yolk from the egg white using a plastic water bottle is an efficient and mess-free method. This technique comes in handy when you're baking or cooking recipes that call for either only yolks or whites. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to separate an egg using a plastic water bottle: 1. Prepare your materials: - A clean, empty plastic water bottle with a lid (preferably small- to medium-sized, so it's easier to control) - A small bowl or container for the egg yolk - A large bowl or container for the egg whites - A flat surface or plate for cracking the egg - A clean kitchen towel or paper towels for wiping up any spills 2. Crack the egg: - Place the egg on a flat surface or plate. Using the edge of a counter, a knife, or the back of a spoon, gently tap the equator of the eggshell until you see a small crack. - Carefully pull the eggshell apart with your fingers, trying to avoid any shell pieces from falling into the egg. Allow the egg contents to fall onto the flat surface or plate. 3. Inspect the egg: - Before the next step, ensure the egg yolk is intact and not broken. If it appears damaged, discard the egg and start again with a new one. - Remove any tiny bits of eggshell that may have fallen into the egg using a spoon or your clean fingers. 4. Prepare the water bottle: - Remove the lid of the plastic water bottle. - Ensure that the bottle is clean and free of any residue or liquid from its previous use. - Squeeze the middle of the bottle to force some air out, creating a small vacuum. 5. Separate the egg yolk: - With the squeezed bottle, carefully place the opening over the egg yolk while keeping its body squeezed. - Slowly release your grip on the bottle, allowing the vacuum created to suck the egg yolk into the bottle. Make sure the edge of the bottle remains in contact with the flat surface to prevent any air from entering, which may break the yolk. - Once the yolk is securely in the bottle, carefully lift the bottle away from the egg white. 6. Transfer the yolk and the egg white: - Gently move the bottle with the yolk over the small bowl or container you prepared earlier. Squeeze the bottle once again to release the egg yolk. Make sure that the yolk does not get mixed with the egg white in this process. - Pour the egg white from the flat surface or plate into the large bowl or container using a scraper or a similar tool to ensure you collect as much of the egg white as possible. 7. Clean up: - Wash and dry the plastic water bottle, so it's ready for your next egg-separating adventure. - Wipe up any spills or drips with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, ensuring your workspace stays clean. In conclusion, separating an egg yolk from the egg white using a plastic water bottle is a simple, quick, and mess-free technique that anyone can easily execute. It requires very little skill and ensures that your egg yolks and whites remain separated, perfect for any recipe that calls for only one component of the egg."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The thalidomide tragedy resurrected Kefauver's bill to enhance drug regulation that had stalled in Congress, and the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law on 10 October 1962. Manufacturers henceforth had to prove to FDA that their drugs were effective as well as safe before they could go on the US market. The FDA received authority to regulate advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices. The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective. An FDA - National Academy of Sciences collaborative study showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective. A similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later. The answer is:","completion":"The amendment that became law in 1962 began as Kefauver's bill to enhance drug regulation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: This week I shot my Interview with Claire Bridge. Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were. Overall the experience was also, I have a lot of friends who are artists so I hope to do more artist portraits in the future.

Step 1: Understand the Compromise of 1850 The Compromise of 1850 was a series of five bills passed in the United States Congress to resolve disputes related to slavery and territorial expansion. It aimed to address the divisive issue of whether newly acquired territories would allow slavery or not, following the Mexican-American War. Step 2: Identify the key figures Henry Clay, a prominent American statesman and senator, was the initial driving force behind drafting the Compromise of 1850. He crafted a single, comprehensive bill, known as the Omnibus Bill, which included all components of the compromise. Unfortunately, the Omnibus Bill failed to pass due to disagreement among lawmakers. Step 3: Identify who broke the bill into sections Senator Stephen A. Douglas was the one who decided to break the Compromise of 1850 into separate bills, making it more palatable for lawmakers to vote on each individual issue. By doing so, he managed to find support from different factions and coalitions in Congress, ultimately leading to the passage of all five bills. Conclusion: Senator Stephen A. Douglas was the person who broke the Compromise of 1850 into sections, which eventually allowed it to pass in the United States Congress. His strategic approach made it possible for lawmakers to vote on each individual component, leading to the resolution of disputes over slavery and territorial expansion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It turns out it doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist: Judging whether something is stupid \\"comes instantaneously,\\" researcher Aczél Balázs says. \\"If one person calls something stupid, there's a high likelihood others will do the same thing.\\" In fact, the rate of agreement was 90%, the Huffington Post notes. Researchers found that behaviors deemed stupid stem from three primary conditions: Overconfidence: You thought you could, but you couldn’t. Lack of control: You knew you shouldn't, but you did. Absent-mindedness: You weren't paying attention. In the study, researchers gathered online anecdotes describing behaviors that had been called stupid. They asked 154 students to read them and determine if they were, indeed, stupid. Then, the students chose reasons why a behavior was stupid from a list. Some interesting takeaways: People with high intelligence aren't necessarily immune to doing stupid things. A determination of stupidity is based on the observer’s expectations for a person’s behavior; the person engaged in stupid behavior may have different expectations. Understanding the causes of stupid behavior may help people warn others from engaging in it—rather than saying, \\"You’re being stupid,\\" one can say \\"You’re being overconfident.\\" No matter what, Balázs tells Live Science, we not only recognize stupidity when we see it, we love to \\"watch other people doing something stupid as a source of amusement.\\" (Stupidity may have thwarted a Nazi invasion of Britain. Can't get enough stupidity? Here.) Article:","completion":"Title: The Art of Recognizing Stupidity: How Our Brains Instantly Judge Stupid Behavior Introduction Ever wonder what makes a person's behavior seem stupid? Researchers at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest, Hungary, investigated the criteria people use to determine when an action appears stupid. Spoiler alert: most people are pretty quick to judge. The explanation behind this swift discernment may lie in three primary conditions that contribute to stupid behavior: overconfidence, lack of control, and absent-mindedness. The Study To explore how people perceive stupidity, researcher Aczél Balázs and his team collected online anecdotes describing behaviors that had been called stupid. They then asked a group of 154 students to read these anecdotes and judge whether or not those behaviors were indeed stupid. The students also had to select the reasons they believed contributed to the actions being considered as such. The study found a significant 90% rate of agreement among the students when it came to labeling a behavior as stupid. This means that the judgment of stupidity \\"comes instantaneously,\\" as Balázs remarked. \\"If one person calls something stupid, there's a high likelihood others will do the same thing.\\" The Three Primary Conditions of Stupid Behavior According to the research, three main conditions lead people to label actions as stupid: 1. Overconfidence: Believing one can do something, but in reality, cannot. 2. Lack of control: Being aware an action is ill-advised but proceeding with it anyway. 3. Absent-mindedness: Not paying attention to the situation. Interestingly, people with high intelligence aren't necessarily immune to engaging in stupid behavior. The determination of stupidity is also based on the observer's expectations for a person's actions; the person displaying the perceived stupid behavior may have different expectations and not realize their actions are being judged as such. Applying the Research to Everyday Life Understanding the causes of stupid behavior might help to better guide and warn others from engaging in it. Rather than labeling someone's actions as \\"stupid,\\" it would be more helpful to address the specific reasons behind the stupidity, such as overconfidence. This approach could potentially lead to enhanced communication and awareness among individuals in social situations. But it's not all serious, as Balázs points out. People love to \\"watch other people doing something stupid as a source of amusement.\\" So, while the research highlights our propensity to judge stupidity swiftly, it also serves as a reminder of the role laughter and amusement play in our lives, often in response to witnessing \\"stupid\\" behavior. Conclusion The study conducted at Eotvos Lorand University provides insight into our cognitive and social processes when it comes to judging stupid behavior. Whether it results from overconfidence, lack of control, or absent-mindedness, the ability to recognize and assess these situations is an innate part of being human. However, by understanding the factors contributing to such behaviors, perhaps we can strive to be more understanding, rather than simply labeling actions as \\"stupid.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The father of a Chechen immigrant killed in Florida... (Associated Press) Meanwhile, the father of a Chechen immigrant killed in Florida while being interrogated by the FBI about his ties to the slain brother maintained that the U.S. agents killed his son \\"execution-style.\\" Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, walked without a wheelchair to speak to his mother last week for the first and only phone conversation they have had since he has been in custody, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva told the AP. In a rare glimpse at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's state of mind, he told her he was getting better and that he had a very good doctor, but was struggling to understand what happened, she said. \\"He didn't hold back his emotions either, as if he were screaming to the whole world: What is this? What's happening?,\\" she said. The April 15 bombings killed three people and wounded more than 260. Elder brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed in a shootout with police, and Dzhokhar remains in a prison hospital after being badly wounded. \\"I could just feel that he was being driven crazy by the unfairness that happened to us, that they killed our innocent Tamerlan,\\" their mother said, standing by the family's insistence that their children are innocent. The Tsarnaevs met the AP in their new apartment in a 14-story building in a well-to-do area of Makhachkala, the capital of the restive Caucasus province of Dagestan. The apartment had no furniture apart from a TV, a few rugs, and wallpaper materials lying on the floor. Anzor Tsarnaev, the suspects' father, said they bought it for Tamerlan, his wife, and their young daughter in the expectation that they would move to Makhachkala later this year. He added that they planned to turn their old home in a dingy district on the outskirts of town into a dentist's office, so that Dzhokhar, a dental hygiene student, could work out of it after completing his studies. \\"All I can do is pray to God and hope that one day fairness will win out, our children will be cleared, and we will at least get Dzhokhar back, crippled, but at least alive,\\" Tsarnaev said. Separately, at a news conference in Moscow, the father of a 27-year-old mixed martial arts fighter who was killed during FBI questioning accused agents of being \\"bandits\\" who executed his son. Abdul-Baki Todashev showed journalists 16 photographs that he said were of his son, Ibragim, in a Florida morgue. He said his son had six gunshot wounds to his torso and one to the back of his head and the pictures were taken by his son's friend, Khusen Taramov. It was not immediately possible to authenticate the photographs. The FBI says Todashev was being questioned by an FBI agent and two Massachusetts state troopers about his ties to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, as well as about a 2011 triple slaying in Massachusetts. Three law enforcement officials said initially that Ibragim Todashev had lunged at the FBI agent with a knife, although two of them later said it was no longer clear what had happened. The father said his son was \\"100 percent unarmed.\\" Taramov confirmed Thursday that he had taken some pictures of Ibragim Todashev's body at an Orlando funeral home and sent them to the father. He said Ibragim Todashev had a decorative sword with a broken handle, but that it was not a weapon. \\"The sword wouldn't cut nothing,\\" Tamarov said. \\"I played with it many times. It wasn't sharp from any angle. It would do the same harm as a piece of wood.\\" The father said Taramov told him that U.S. agents interrogated him on the street while five officials interrogated Todashev in his Florida house for eight hours on May 22, the night he was shot. Todashev's father said that his son moved to the U.S. in 2008 on a study exchange program and met Tsarnaev at a boxing gym in Boston in 2011, about a year before he moved to Orlando. He said the two were \\"not particularly close friends.\\" Prior to last month's bombings, Todashev underwent an operation for a sports injury and was on crutches, making it physically impossible for him to have been involved in the bombings, his father said. He added that Todashev had recently received a green card and was planning to return to Chechnya for the summer last Friday, two days after he was killed. The father said he and his brother were interviewed at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow on Thursday as they sought a visa to take his son's body back to Chechnya. FBI agents interrogated the younger Todashev twice before the night he was shot, his father said. He said his son told him that he thought Tsarnaev had been set up to take the blame for the bombings. \\"I'd only seen and heard things like that in the movies _ they shoot somebody and then a shot in the head to make sure,\\" Todashev said. \\"These just aren't FBI agents, they're bandits,\\" he added. The FBI wouldn't comment on the claims made by Todashev's father. The Tsarnaevs' parents have held fast to their belief that their sons were framed. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, dressed all in black and still visibly distressed, showed AP several YouTube videos on an iPad she claimed cleared her sons. They could not be authenticated by the AP. \\"I remember when our cat was sick, Tamerlan was sick himself for two days afterward, because he was so worried about her,\\" Tsarnaeva said. She said Tamerlan told her about Todashev, and that she and her husband had invited him to visit them in Russia, though he never came. Tamerlan later told them that he and Todashev were unlikely to continue training together since they practiced different sports, and he appeared to have lost track of him after Todashev moved to Florida, Tsarnaeva added. _____ Seddon reported from Moscow.

Sign Up BOSTON (CBS) – Law enforcement officials are revealing what they say happened just before the deadly FBI shooting in Florida. Multiple sources tell the I-Team that the suspect, Ibrahim Todashev, flipped over a table, grabbed what appeared to be a metal pole, and lunged at the FBI agent before that agent fired. Officials say there were four investigators interviewing Todashev that day: Two Massachusetts State Troopers questioning him about the Waltham triple murder, an FBI agent questioning him about Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and a local Florida police officer. They had spoken with him earlier in the day, and then returned that night for a second interview. At one point, an official says, two of the investigators stepped outside, and one of the state troopers and an FBI agent were left inside with Todashev. The FBI agent had built up a rapport with Todashev and he was doing most of the questioning. An official says Todashev was about to provide a written confession to the Waltham murders, when the state trooper who was present, noticed Todashev became agitated and shared that information with the FBI agent through a text message, so Todashev wouldn’t hear what they were discussing. The official says the FBI agent looked down to read the text message, and at that moment Todashev flipped over a table into the agent and knocked him into the wall. According to the officials, Todashev then grabbed a pole that was nearby, and started lunging at the agent. The agent shot Todashev two to three times, stopping him momentarily, before the official says Todashev came at the agent again. The official says that is when the FBI agent shot and killed Todashev. He was treated with several stitches for his cuts from being hit by the table. There have been other media reports that Todashev used a sword. Sources tell WBZ there had been a sword on the wall, but one of the investigators took it down earlier to get it out of the way. ||||| The ethnic Chechen was being questioned about his ties to a Boston bombing suspect.

Sheriff Office) Story Highlights Government source says he lunged at an FBI agent Florida Islamic group calls for an independent investigation The father of a Florida man with ties to Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev said Thursday that his son was slain \\"execution-style\\" by FBI agents last week in Orlando. Ibragim Todashev, a 27-year-old mixed martial arts fighter, was shot in his Florida home on May 22 while an FBI agent and two Massachusetts state troopers questioned him about the Boston Marathon bombing suspect, as well as a triple slaying in Massachusetts two years ago. Todashev's father, Abdul-Baki Todashev, told reporters in Moscow that his son had several gunshot wounds to his torso and one to the back of his head. The elder Todashev displayed photos he claimed were of his son's body in a Florida morgue, according to the Associated Press. Initially, at least one law enforcement official told USA TODAY that Todashev, an ethnic Chechen, was armed with a knife or other sharp object and violently attacked an FBI agent during questioning, which led the agent to open fire. Abdul-Baki Todashev speaks at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday. (Photo: Alexander Zemlianichenko, AP) Some news reports Thursday, quoting FBI and law enforcement sources, said Todashev was unarmed when he was shot. Late Thursday, a more detailed government version of the incident emerged. Todashev overturned a wooden table, forcefully shoved an FBI agent into a wall and lunged at the agent with a pole, a government official briefed on the incident but not authorized to speak publicly said. The FBI agent and state troopers had interviewed Todashev earlier that morning, the government official said. That afternoon, when Todashev did not answer his phone, the FBI agent, the two troopers and an Orlando police officer went to his condo, the government official said. Todashev invited them in and began talking, the official said. As the conversation continued, Todashev indicated he was ready to confess to his involvement in the homicides, so the FBI agent pulled up a table so Todashev could write down his confession, the government official said. Meanwhile, one of the troopers left the room to make a phone call and the Orlando officer accompanied him, the official said. Todashev became agitated, the government official said. He suddenly stood and flipped the wooden table up, hitting the FBI agent, who was slammed \\"forcefully\\" into the wall, the government official said. Todashev reached down and picked up a metal pole about the size of a broom handle and swung it at the FBI agent, the official said. The agent fired two or three shots, hitting Todashev, but Todashev came at him again with the metal pole, the official said. The FBI agent then shot him \\"until he eliminated the threat,\\" the official said. The incident happened in a few seconds, the official said. The FBI agent was treated at the hospital for injuries, including lacerations that required stitches, the government official said. An advocacy group is demanding a civil rights investigation into the death of a Chechen immigrant who was shot to death by authorities in central Florida while being questioned about his ties to one of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects. (May 30) AP At the news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Todashev's father, flanked by Maxim Shevchenko, a member of the Presidential Council of Human Rights, said his son was never a close friend of Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and knew nothing about the attacks in advance. He called \\"absurd\\" the claims by some U.S. officials that Todashev had attacked an FBI agent. \\"Maybe my son knew something, some information the police did not want to be made public. Maybe they wanted to silence my son,\\" Todashev's father said. He said his son was grilled for many hours about the Boston bombings. \\"They tortured a man for eight hours with no attorney, no witnesses, nobody. We can only guess what was going on there, until there is an official investigation,\\" Todashev said. Shevchenko told reporters at the news conference that Todashev's killing looked like \\"cold-blooded murder.\\" The Florida branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations has called for a federal civil rights investigation. \\"We have confirmed through senior sources within the FBI that Ibragim was indeed unarmed when he was shot seven times in the head, what appear to be even in the back of the head,\\" said Hassan Shibly, executive director of the CAIR Florida. \\"That's very disturbing.\\" Later, according to the Orlando Sentinel, Shibly told reporters that CAIR has an \\"intermediary\\" who said the FBI told him Todashev was unarmed. Shibly did not identify the intermediary. Shibly, speaking to reporters in Orlando on Wednesday, said the group was calling for the independent investigation \\"to make sure excessive force was not used against this unarmed individual.\\" Todashev has not been directly implicated in the April 15 Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and injured more than 260. The FBI has said only that Todashev, a martial arts enthusiast like Tamerlan Tsarnaev, knew the suspect when he lived in Boston. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 27, and his brother, Dzhokhar, 19, were named as suspects in the bombings. Tamerlan died three days after the bombings during a shootout with police that also left Dzhokhar injured. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was later captured and charged in connection with the bombings. He is being held at a prison medical center near Boston.

The ceiling of the apartment has a leak, which worsens on a daily basis. Matsubara complains to the janitor but he does nothing to fix the leak. She then tries to go to the floor above her apartment to find out the root of the leak, and discovers that the apartment is locked. Strange events then happen repeatedly: a red bag with a bunny on the front reappears no matter how often Yoshimi tries to dispose of it. Hair is found in tap water. Yoshimi gets glimpses of a mysterious long-haired girl who is of similar age to her daughter. Yoshimi discovers that the upstairs apartment, the source of the leak, was formerly the home of a girl named Mitsuko Kawai (æ²³å ç¾æ´¥å­ Kawai Mitsuko; Mirei Oguchi), who was Ikuko's age. She had attended the same kindergarten Ikuko now attends. Mitsuko was abandoned by her mother and vanished more than a year ago. One day, Ikuko goes missing and Yoshimi finds her in the apartment upstairs, where the walls are running with water and the entire place is flooded. Convinced something eerie is happening, she decides to move but her lawyer convinces her that moving now would weaken her position greatly in her divorce. One evening, after Yoshimi finds that the red bag has reappeared in Ikuko's school bag, she heads to the roof of the building, and is drawn to the huge water tank. She notices that it was last inspected â and thus opened â over a year ago, on the day Mitsuko was last reported seen.

Solve -665*k - 467809 + 407294 = 0 for k.","completion":"Alright, let's solve the equation like we're talking to a five-year-old. So we have this equation: -665 * k - 467809 + 407294 = 0 First, let's add the big numbers (-467809 and 407294) together: -467809 + 407294 = -60,515 Now our equation looks like this: -665 * k - 60,515 = 0 Next, we want to get rid of the -60,515 on the left side. To do this, we'll add 60,515 to both sides of the equation: -665 * k = 60,515 Now we just need to find out what number \\"k\\" is. To find it, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -665: k = 60,515 / -665 When you do that division, you'll find that: k = -91 So, k = -91 is the solution to the equation.

Can you tell me the answer to what is a good solvent for vegetable oil??","completion":"Vegetable oil, being an organic compound, typically follows the principle of \\"like dissolves like.\\" It means that polar substances dissolve in polar solvents, while nonpolar substances are more soluble in nonpolar solvents. Vegetable oil is a nonpolar substance, so a good solvent for it would be a nonpolar or a slightly polar solvent. Here is a list of suitable solvents along with some additional information about each one: 1. Isopropyl alcohol: Also known as rubbing alcohol, isopropyl alcohol is a slightly polar solvent that can dissolve vegetable oil effectively. It is a common household item and is readily available in drugstores. It is widely used as a solvent, disinfectant, and cleaner. 2. Ethanol: Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol or grain alcohol, is another slightly polar solvent that is effective in dissolving vegetable oil. It is the same type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, and it’s often used as a solvent in various industrial processes. It is a more eco-friendly and food-safe option than isopropyl alcohol. 3. Acetone: Acetone, also known as propanone or dimethyl ketone, is a colorless liquid that is used as a solvent in various industries, including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and plastics. Although not as effective as isopropyl alcohol or ethanol in dissolving vegetable oil, it can be used as an alternative. Be aware that acetone has a strong odor and is highly flammable. 4. Toluene: Toluene is a nonpolar solvent that can dissolve vegetable oil. It is a colorless, water-insoluble liquid used mainly as a solvent in industrial processes. It is highly effective in dissolving vegetable oil, but it is not a food-safe option and should be used with caution due to its toxic nature. 5. Dichloromethane: Dichloromethane, also known as methylene chloride, is a powerful nonpolar solvent that can dissolve vegetable oil with ease. It is used in various industries, such as paint removers, degreasers, and other cleaning applications. However, dichloromethane is toxic and not suitable for home use or in applications where it can come into contact with food. Its use must be strictly controlled. 6. Hexane: Hexane is a nonpolar solvent commonly used to extract edible oils from seeds and other plant materials. It is also used as a solvent in various industrial processes. Hexane is very effective in dissolving vegetable oil but, like dichloromethane, should be used with caution due to its flammable and toxic nature. 7. Diethyl ether: Diethyl ether, sometimes referred to as ether, is a colorless and highly volatile liquid. It is used as a solvent in various industrial and laboratory applications. It can effectively dissolve vegetable oil; however, it is not safe for food or home use due to its flammability and possible harmful health effects. When choosing a solvent for vegetable oil, consider the application, safety concerns, and whether the solvent will come into contact with food. For food-related applications, ethanol or other food-grade solvents would be more appropriate. For non-food purposes, isopropyl alcohol, acetone, or hexane can be used, but always ensure that proper safety precautions are taken while handling potentially toxic or flammable solvents."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Scientist Florence Wambugu works with farmers in Kenya, a country in East Africa. She helps them grow bigger and better crops. Wambugu is especially interested in finding simple ways to produce more food. In the past ten years, Wambugu has spent much of her time studying sweet potatoes, which are an important food in her part of Kenya. A virus kept attacking the plants. It stopped the sweet potatoes from growing well. Because of the virus, some farmers lost three quarters of their crops. Wambugu went to war against the virus. Her research for a way to save the sweet potatoes led to a lab in St. Louis, Missouri. The lab mainly works on genes , the chemical \\"computer programs\\" found in the cells of living things. Genes tell a plant to produce pink flowers or an animal to grow black hair. Now scientists have found ways to move genes from one living thing to another. That process is called genetic engineering. Wambugu spent three years in the lab. As a result, she created a sweet potato plant that could fight off the virus. Wambugu tested her research in Kenya, and her plants produced wonderful sweet potatoes. That's just the beginning, Wambugu believes. Genetically modified foods, she thinks, could help farmers in poor countries grow badly needed crops, thus, fewer people will go hungry.

Homogenized milk has already had its fat molecules broken down before it is sent to the store. If your milk is straight from the cow, you know it hasn’t been homogenized yet. Check the label on your store-bought milk and make sure it says “non-homogenized” on it. You can buy non-homogenized milk at many natural grocery stores or farmers markets. Choose a container that you can make airtight. Mason jars, tupperware containers, or even cups with plastic wrap on top will work. Pour as much milk as you want to skim into your container. You can purchase mason jars in bulk for a low price at most grocery stores. Use a clear container to make it easier to see the separation line between the milk and the fat. Keep your milk in its container inside of your fridge. The fat will naturally rise to the top as your milk sits undisturbed. Be sure not to shake the milk or move it around as it is sitting. Cold milk takes longer to separate, but leaving milk out at room temperature could cause it to spoil. Once your milk has separated, you will be able to see a layer of cream, or fat, floating at the top of your container. The cream will be a slightly lighter color, and might have small bubbles in it. Once you identify the cream line, you'll know how much cream to skim off the top. Carefully scrape the layer of cream off the top of the milk with a spoon. You can save the cream to use in a recipe or rinse it down the drain. Be careful not to mix the cream back into the milk. You can keep your skim milk in the container that you were using, or transfer it to a separate one. Be sure to store your skim milk at a cold temperature in the fridge. Try putting skim milk into recipes as a healthier alternative to whole milk. Summary:","completion":"This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to skim cream from non-homogenized milk by allowing it to separate in a clear, airtight container in the fridge and then carefully removing the cream layer, resulting in skim milk that can be used as a healthier alternative in recipes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Secretary Chertoff says he won't relent \\"for a particular individual\\" Eloisa Tamez says her property has been in her family since 1767. Border town mayor calls the fence \\"a multibillion-dollar speed bump\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Landowners Stand Firm Against Government Land Seizure for Border Fence Introduction: The United States government is facing pushback in its efforts to acquire private property for the construction of a border fence, designed to deter illegal immigration and drug smuggling. In particular, Eloisa Tamez, a landowner whose property has been in her family since 1767, is steadfast in her refusal to relinquish her land. This situation has sparked discussions about the effectiveness and morality of the fence project. Landowners Refuse to Relinquish Property: In various parts of the country, landowners are defying the United States government's efforts to appropriate their land for the construction of a border fence. \\"I will never sign any papers giving [the government] permission to come onto my land,\\" Eloisa Tamez says, maintaining that her property, which has been in her family for generations, is immensely valuable to her. Despite the difficulties posed by these protests, Secretary Chertoff has expressed his commitment to the border fence project, stating that he will not be deterred \\"for a particular individual.\\" Historical Importance of the Land: One key point in the landowners' argument is the historical and cultural significance of their properties. Eloisa Tamez's land, for example, has been passed down through her family since 1767. These family ties run deep, with a strong sense of attachment to the land. The proposed border fence would cut through these properties, potentially destroying centuries-old buildings and disrupting the cultural heritage of the region. Border Town Mayor's Critique: The fence project has also faced criticism from local political leaders, such as the mayor of a border town who refers to the fence as \\"a multibillion-dollar speed bump.\\" This sentiment highlights the belief that the costly project will not be effective in stopping illegal immigration or drug smuggling. Opponents of the fence also argue that investing in more advanced technology, such as ground sensors and cameras, would be a better use of resources. Conclusion: As the United States government continues its pursuit to acquire land for the construction of a border fence, private landowners and local leaders are not backing down. With historical and cultural significance serving as the backdrop to these disputes, the debate regarding the effectiveness and necessity of the border fence will continue. As contentious as this issue may be, it raises questions about the right way to address perceived problems at the border while respecting individual property rights and cultural heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: These include the flying buttresses, pinnacles and traceried windows which typify Gothic ecclesiastical architecture. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"Yes, the answer correctly addresses the question by providing examples of Gothic-style elements that were incorporated due to technological innovation. To give a more detailed and long response, let's dive deeper into these innovations: One of the most significant technological innovations in Gothic architecture was the development and application of the flying buttress. Flying buttresses are arched exterior supports that transfer the weight of the vaulted ceilings and walls outward and downward to massive piers or columns. As a result, these structures allowed for thinner walls, larger windows, and higher ceilings, which enabled the creation of more extensive stained glass windows, a defining feature of Gothic cathedrals. The widespread use of flying buttresses greatly impacted the visual aesthetic of Gothic architecture, as they allowed for more elaborate and detailed designs in the exterior. They helped create tall, slender structures with intricate and decorative elements while still providing structural support. This characteristic enabled Gothic architects to experiment with different visual balances and structural forms, contributing to the unique ornate style associated with Gothic architecture. The pinnacle is another example of a Gothic-style element that was incorporated due to technological innovations. Pinnacles are tall, slender, and pointed elements that are often placed at the corners of buildings or atop flying buttresses. They serve both as decorative features and structural reinforcements, providing additional weight to stabilize the flying buttresses and helping to resist wind forces. Pinnacles were a product of the advancements in stone carving, as their intricate and delicate nature demanded precise craftsmanship and technological improvements in quarrying and shaping stone. Traceried windows, another characteristic feature of Gothic architecture, were also made possible by technological innovations. Traceried windows are elaborate, decorative windows with patterns of stone divisions (called tracery) that create a visual effect both inside and outside the building. The development of more advanced stone-cutting techniques allowed artisans to create these intricate geometric designs without compromising the structural integrity of the window. Tracery designs often included elements like quatrefoils, trefoils, and ogee arches, contributing to the iconic visual language of Gothic architecture. In summary, Gothic architecture incorporated numerous style elements, such as flying buttresses, pinnacles, and traceried windows, through the advancements in technological innovation. The development of new construction techniques and the craftsmanship allowed architects to create visually stunning and structurally sound buildings that have endured for centuries, reflecting the brilliance of the Gothic style and its impact on architectural history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, the critic's mention of \\"quality\\" could refer to the perceived lack of balance in tone or inferior production aspects, such as poor direction, unconvincing performances, or weak storytelling. [ii] Positive view: On the other hand, if the critic viewed the film's \\"seriousness\\" as a positive trait, they might have appreciated the mature themes, thought-provoking subject matter, or engaging drama, which contributed to a well-crafted and meaningful cinematic experience. In this scenario, the term \\"quality\\" would likely refer to the film's high production values, compelling narrative, exceptional performances, and skillful direction that resulted in a polished and memorable movie. In conclusion, the critic's opinion on the movie's \\"seriousness\\" and \\"quality\\" could lead to either a positive or negative review, and additional context is needed to determine their precise stance. It is important to analyze specific phrases or statements made within the review to more accurately gauge whether the critic leaned more towards a positive or negative assessment of the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Where do I acquire a letter of credit from? What is a letter of credit? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"A letter of credit is a financial instrument used in international trade to mitigate risk and ensure that sellers receive payment for their goods or services. They are particularly useful in cross-border transactions, as they provide a level of security and certainty for both the buyers and the sellers involved. A letter of credit is essentially a written commitment from a bank, on behalf of the buyer, guaranteeing payment to the seller under the terms and conditions specified in the letter. To acquire a letter of credit, you should follow these steps: 1. Choose a bank: Find a financial institution that offers letters of credit services. This is generally a bank with which you have an existing business relationship or one that is experienced in handling international trade transactions. You can approach your current bank or search for a bank that specializes in trade finance. 2. Provide necessary information: Complete the bank's application form for a letter of credit (sometimes referred to as the \\"Letter of Credit Application and Agreement\\"). On this form, you will need to provide information such as: - The full name and address of the beneficiary (the seller) - The amount and currency of the letter of credit - A description of the goods or services to be purchased - The shipping terms (Incoterms) and any related insurance requirements - The expiration date and place for the presentation of documents 3. Submit supporting documents: In addition to the application form, the bank may require you to submit various supporting documents such as: - Purchase order, contract, or pro forma invoice between the buyer and the seller - Financial statements or business plans, particularly for new businesses or those seeking a large letter of credit - Evidence of creditworthiness, such as personal or business credit reports 4. Await bank review and approval: Once the application and supporting documents have been submitted, the bank will review the information and determine whether to issue the letter of credit. This process may involve checking your creditworthiness, the feasibility of the transaction, and compliance with local and international regulations. 5. Pay fees and secure collateral: Upon approval, you will need to pay the fees associated with the issuance of a letter of credit. These fees may vary depending on the bank, complexity of the transaction, and the specific terms of the letter of credit. Additionally, the bank may require you to provide collateral (such as cash, property, or other assets) to secure the letter of credit, particularly if the bank believes there may be risks associated with the transaction. 6. Receive and review the issued letter of credit: After the bank issues the letter of credit, you should review the document carefully to ensure that all the terms and conditions are accurate and consistent with your agreement with the seller. Provide a copy of the letter of credit to the seller and make sure they understand and agree with its terms. In conclusion, the questions you asked do not have the same meaning. The first question asks where you can acquire a letter of credit, while the second question asks for the definition of a letter of credit. Acquiring a letter of credit involves following certain steps with a financial institution that issues such letters, while understanding a letter of credit revolves around grasping its purpose, uses, and role in international trade transactions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Atlantic City was incorporated on May 1, 1854, from portions of Egg Harbor Township and Galloway Township. The city borders Absecon, Brigantine, Pleasantville, Ventnor City and West Atlantic City. Because of its location in South Jersey, hugging the Atlantic Ocean between marshlands and islands, Atlantic City was viewed by developers as prime real estate and a potential resort town. In 1853, the first commercial hotel, The Belloe House, located at Massachusetts and Atlantic Avenue, was built. The city was incorporated in 1854, the same year in which the Camden and Atlantic Railroad train service began. Built on the edge of the bay, this served as the direct link of this remote parcel of land with Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. That same year, construction of the Absecon Lighthouse, designed by George Meade of the Corps of Topographical Engineers, was approved, with work initiated the next year. By 1874, almost 500,000 passengers a year were coming to Atlantic City by rail. In Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City, \\"Atlantic City's Godfather\\" Nelson Johnson describes the inspiration of Dr. Jonathan Pitney (the \\"Father of Atlantic City\\") to develop Atlantic City as a health resort, his efforts to convince the municipal authorities that a railroad to the beach would be beneficial, his successful alliance with Samuel Richards (entrepreneur and member of the most influential family in southern New Jersey at the time) to achieve that goal, the actual building of the railroad, and the experience of the first 600 riders, who \\"were chosen carefully by Samuel Richards and Jonathan Pitney\\": Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1.

Output:","completion":"Task explanation: You are given a math problem involving the number of people who purchased books A and B. You must find the number of people (C) who purchased only book A. Step 1: Understand the given information - The number of people who purchased book A is twice the number of people who purchased book B. - The number of people who purchased both books A and B is 500. - The number of people who purchased only book B is half the number of people who purchased both books A and B. Step 2: Set up equations based on the given information Let A be the number of people who purchased book A. Let B be the number of people who purchased book B. Let X be the number of people who purchased only book B. You are asked to find the number of people C who purchased only book A. From the given information, you can form the following equations: 1. A = 2B (since the number of people who purchased book A is twice the number of people who purchased book B) 2. A + B - 500 = C (since the 500 people who purchased both books should be removed to find the people who purchased only book A) 3. 500 = 2X (since the number of people who purchased only book B is half the number of people who purchased both books A and B) Step 3: Solve the equations First, we'll solve Equation 3: 500 = 2X X = 250 (This indicates that 250 people purchased only book B) Now, we'll plug the value of X in Equation 2: A + B - 500 = C A + 250 - 500 = C (Since X = 250) A - 250 = C Next, we'll substitute A from Equation 1 into the equation above: 2B - 250 = C Step 4: Find B using the information given We know that the number of people who purchased both books A and B is 500, which is twice the number of people who purchased only book B. So: 500 = 2(250) (Since 250 people purchased only book B) 500 = 500 (The equation holds true, so our value for B is correct) Step 5: Find A using the value of B Now that we found B, we can find A using Equation 1: A = 2B A = 2(250) A = 500 Step 6: Find C using the values of A and B Finally, we can find C using the equation from Step 3: C = A - 250 C = 500 - 250 C = 250 Output: The number of people C who purchased only book A is 250."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given these facts, what do earthworms do among the following options: - Start fires - reproduce - Destroy earth - Move to another area - Converting waste. - Create earth - competing for resources - Help plants grow A:","completion":"Earthworms play several crucial roles in the ecosystem, particularly in enhancing soil quality and promoting plant growth. Among the options provided, their primary functions include reproduction, converting waste, and helping plants grow. Let us explore these roles in detail, along with a few more critical functions that earthworms serve. 1. Reproduction: Earthworms reproduce by producing cocoons, which encase the young worms, providing them with necessary nutrients in their early stages. A healthy population of earthworms helps maintain their vital functions in the ecosystem. 2. Converting waste: Earthworms consume organic matter and waste, such as dead leaves, decaying plants, and detritus. Through a process called digestion, they break down this matter into simpler compounds and excrete nutrient-rich castings. These castings, or worm poop, form a large part of the organic matter in soil, making it more fertile and capable of supporting healthier plant growth. 3. Help plants grow: The nutrient-rich castings produced by earthworms, along with their tunneling activities, help enhance soil structure and aeration. Air and water can penetrate the soil more easily, improving root penetration and nutrient uptake by plants. Additionally, earthworms help in the distribution of nutrients throughout the soil layers, ensuring that plants have access to them at different root depths. 4. Soil formation: Earthworms contribute to soil formation by turning and mixing the different layers. Their burrowing and feeding activities help bring mineral-rich subsoil to the surface, mixing it with organic materials. This process enriches the topsoil and provides a fertile environment for plant growth. 5. Enhancing microbial activity: The gut of earthworms is home to various beneficial microorganisms, which assist in breaking down organic matter into simpler compounds. When earthworms excrete their castings, these microorganisms are introduced into the soil, where they further contribute to nutrient cycling and overall soil health. Though earthworms may move to another area when environmental conditions become unfavorable, this activity doesn't fall within their most critical functions. As for the other options like starting fires, destroying earth, creating earth, and competing for resources, these do not pertain to the roles of earthworms in the ecosystem. In conclusion, earthworms primarily reproduce, convert waste, and help plants grow by participating in vital processes such as soil formation, enhancing microbial activity, and improving soil structure. All these functions contribute to the health of the ecosystem and support overall biodiversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a premise: Sure thing they would! Here is a hypothesis: No, they wouldn't. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"In order to analyze the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, let us first explore their meanings and the logic behind them. Premise: \\"Sure thing they would!\\" This statement implies that there is certainty in the belief that a particular action, event or behavior would occur. It represents a confidence in its occurrence and serves as the basis for drawing conclusions. Hypothesis: \\"No, they wouldn't.\\" This statement, on the other hand, proposes the opposite outcome, suggesting that the particular action, event or behavior would not occur. It is an alternative explanation or prediction that contradicts the premise or the existing belief. Now, let's determine if it's possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. In this case, both the premise and hypothesis represent opposing viewpoints or outcomes. They are mutually exclusive, meaning that if one of them is true, the other must be false. This is because the premise asserts a positive belief in the occurrence of something while the hypothesis suggests the exact opposite occurrence. Given this relationship, if the premise is true (i.e., it is a sure thing that they would do something or something would happen), it is not possible for the hypothesis to be true simultaneously (i.e., they wouldn't do that thing, or it wouldn't happen), as they cannot both be true at the same time. However, it's important to note that although the premise and hypothesis represent opposing viewpoints, this does not mean that they entirely nullify each other - there is always the possibility that both the premise and the hypothesis are incorrect. What it does mean is that they cannot both be true together given their contradictory nature. In conclusion, it is not possible to determine that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. They represent opposing outcomes and are mutually exclusive. If the premise is true, it likely means that the hypothesis is false, and vice versa. However, it's crucial to remember that the truth of one does not necessarily establish the validity of the other, as both could be incorrect. In any situation, it's important to gather evidence, test assumptions, and use logic and reasoning when determining the truth of a premise or hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The concept of God as described by most theologians includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), divine simplicity, and as having an eternal and necessary existence. Many theologians also describe God as being omnibenevolent (perfectly good) and all loving. - Hebrew Bible or Hebrew Scriptures is the term used by biblical scholars to refer to the \\"Tanakh\\", the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is the common textual source of several canonical editions of the Christian Old Testament. They are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others). - An oven is a thermally insulated chamber used for the heating, baking or drying of a substance, and most commonly used for cooking. Kilns and furnaces are special-purpose ovens, used in pottery and metalworking, respectively. - The Israelites (\\"Bnei Yisra'el\\") were a Semitic-speaking people of the ancient Near East, who inhabited a part of Canaan during the tribal and monarchic periods. The ancient Israelites are considered to be an outgrowth of the indigenous Canaanite populations that long inhabited the Southern Levant, Syria, ancient Israel and the Transjordan. - Hebrew (\\"\\" or ) is a language native to Israel, spoken by over 9 million people worldwide, of whom over 5 million are in Israel. Historically, it is regarded as the language of the Israelites and their ancestors, although the language was not referred to by the name Hebrew in the Tanakh. The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date from the 10th century BCE. Hebrew belongs to the West Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. The Hebrew language is the only living Canaanite language left. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\" - A Cheder ( alternatively , Cheider , in Hebrew , meaning \`\` room '' ) is a traditional elementary school teaching the basics of Judaism and the Hebrew language . - The Torah (\\"instruction, teaching\\"), or in Christianity, the Pentateuch (\\"five books\\"), is the central reference of the religious Judaic tradition. It has a range of meanings. It can most specifically mean the first five books of the twenty-four books of the Tanakh, and it usually includes the rabbinic commentaries ('). The term \\"Torah\\" means instruction and offers a way of life for those who follow it; it can mean the continued narrative from Book of Genesis to the end of the Tanakh, and it can even mean the totality of Jewish teaching, culture and practice. Common to all these meanings, Torah consists of the foundational narrative of Jewish peoplehood: their call into being by God, their trials and tribulations, and their covenant with their God, which involves following a way of life embodied in a set of moral and religious obligations and civil laws ('). - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\" - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world. - Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea.

Johnson is a justice on California's Second District Court of Appeal. Lash and Johnson are co-chairs of the California Commission on Access to Justice. The full report can be viewed at (www.calbar.org). In her year-long odyssey through the California justice system, Katherine, a 35-year-old single mother with three children, experienced failure at every turn. Leaving her abusive husband, she moved into the only apartment she could afford, and soon discovered a broken toilet and non- working oven, rats and roaches, and a fourthfloor landing with no railing. She began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, but then her Medi-Cal benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent receipts. She lost health care for her children and herself, although she is a borderline diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat bites. Katherine tried to seek help through the courts. Representing herself at an administrative hearing, she lost her appeal to restore Medi-Cal benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent account. When she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord, she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home. According to \\"The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" prepared by the California Commission on Access to Justice, Katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs -- often involving such critical needs as housing, health care, education, employment, safety and transportation -- are not being addressed. California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system. Our justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services. California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor, but there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. We may promise \\"justice for all,\\" but for those who can't afford a lawyer, that promise is often a lie. In its new report, the Commission on Access to Justice notes some significant steps toward providing equal access to justice for all Californians. Do you have any questions?","completion":"Based on the extensive information provided, numerous questions can be formed. Some of them include: 1. What are the steps that the Commission on Access to Justice has taken towards providing equal access to the justice system in California? 2. What are the recommendations of Lash and Johnson, as co-chairs of the California Commission on Access to Justice, to address the shortage of legal services for the poor? 3. How is the University of Southern California Law School, where Lash is an associate dean, contributing towards access to justice? 4. What has been Justice Johnson's approach to improving access to justice during his tenure in the Second District Court of Appeal? 5. Is the current system of having lawyers as gatekeepers to the justice system the most effective approach or are there alternate models that can help in enhancing access to justice? 6. Why does Katherine's example represent the systemic problems in the California justice system? What changes must be implemented in the judicial and administrative procedures to prevent such scenarios in the future? 7. How can public and private funders better coordinate their resources and efforts in order to provide effective legal services to the poor? 8. What specific steps can the state of California undertake in partnership with the federal government to increase resources for legal aid? 9. Are there any programs or initiatives in place to educate and guide individuals like Katherine when navigating the justice system, particularly when they cannot afford a lawyer? 10. How does the lack of access to legal services correlate with other issues such as healthcare, education, employment, safety, and transportation for poor Californians? 11. How can the justice system be restructured or reformed so that it is more easily navigable by those not equipped with a comprehensive legal understanding? 12. What solutions are provided in \\"The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California\\"? How realistic are these solutions given the current legal and economical landscape of California? 13. Are there any plans to increase the number of legal aid lawyers to cater to the high demand among poor Californians? 14. How are the 4.6 million poor Californians, whose basic civil legal needs are unmet, affected in their daily lives and what are the wider social implications? 15. How does the California Commission on Access to Justice plan to address the issue of basic civil legal needs of the poor being unaddressed?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Quickly forgetting about his discovery, he joins a newly transferred detective named Stan Johnson (Curtis \\"50 Cent\\" Jackson) trying to end a conflict involving looters. Post-Katrina, Andy and Stan are now partners. They work with corrupt detectives Pepe and Barney, who are caught up in the murder of an undercover narcotics agent. Investigating the escalating police corruption in New Orleans is FBI Agent Brown. Brown brings up his thoughts to Police Captain Friendly who insists he is doing his best to solve the problems in his department. Meanwhile, police therapist Nina Ferraro tries to help the detectives with their struggles, with little avail. She is particularly interested in Andy, whose father, also a detective, was murdered in the line of duty. Things are complicated further with Agent Brown's investigation into Andy and his crew. Brown tells Andy that he has an informant who is leaking out the details, and Andy, disbelieving at first, begins to resign himself to the fact that one of his men is betraying him. After Captain Friendly is assassinated by a local gangster named Chamorro, Andy, Stan, Pepe, and Barney decide to take the law into their own hands and go after Chamorro. While interrogating Chamorro, they find out that Brown has been supplying the drug dealer with information about the police raids, to help his own investigation. In a violent shootout, Barney accidentally shoots and kills Pepe. Andy and Stan escape, only to return to the warehouse where they met. There Andy realizes that Stan is the informant.

PUBLISHED: 19:09 EST, 1 November 2013 | UPDATED: 19:09 EST, 1 November 2013 Police will not investigate the business affairs of Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps – even though advisors concluded one of his companies may have been guilty of an ‘offence of fraud’. Labour MP Steve McCabe requested an inquiry last year after it was reported that a business Mr Schapps co-founded was selling ‘plagiarising’ software which helps firms boost profits by breaching Google’s rules. The company, HowToCorp, was set up by Mr Shapps using an alias, Michael Green, and his wife Belinda, who now runs it.

Well in the story, the person who's getting talked about a lot is Grant Shapps. His businesses are getting looked at and people are talking about a letter that mentioned something about “fraud.” In this sentence, we find out what people from Shapps's side are saying about all this. This follows directly from the previous part of the story, so it makes sense as the next sentence. All the other choices aren't right. It would be weird if we suddenly started hearing from Google's side or the police's side since we were talking about Shapps. And while we do hear about Tory Party, Labour, HowtoCorp, and more in the story, it's most logical to hear from Shapps's side next because he was the last one being talked about. It's like when you're playing catch – if Shapps was the last one to get the ball, the next throw should probably go to him!"},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Parents fear they are putting too much pressure on their daughters to reach their academic potential, the president of a girls' school body has said. Incoming Girls School Association head Jill Berry said parents were worried about achieving a balance between school achievement and happiness. Mrs. Berry also said that girls could put themselves under a lot of pressure. A poll of 1000 parents surveyed for the association said their top concern was their daughter's education. Girls tend to outperform boys in all stages of their education, and this can lead schools to assume all girls will do well. Mrs. Berry said, \\"There is no doubt that many mothers and fathers are worried about getting the balance right between their daughters realizing their academic potential while at the same time being happy and safe.\\" Mrs. Berry said in her experience girls had very high expectations of themselves. \\"That's a positive thing and we want them to aim high. But sometimes we do find a girl is being unrealistic in her aspirations or putting herself under unreasonable pressure. It's not necessarily pushy parents--it can come from the girls themselves.\\" But parents, too, wanted support to get the balance right between caring and being involved in their children's lives and not being \\"helicopter parents\\", she added. Women could be perfectionists and it was important to encourage girls to listen to their body, which could give warning signs of too much stress, she added. \\"Bright motivated high achieving girls with high expectations of themselves are more susceptible to eating disorders,\\" Mrs. Berry said, \\"But girls' schools are usually very good at dealing with these things.\\" It was a teacher's job to help girls \\"to have it all\\", but to help them deal with inevitable disappointments as well, she said.

If we look at someone else's body, we can often tell how they are feeling by their body signals. So reading body language signals is a great tool in daily communication. In case you don't think that learning how to read and use body language is important, here are some numbers for you. 7% of the information we receive is from what people actually say, and 38% of the information we receive is from the tone and the speed of their voice; while 55% of the information we receive is from their body language. These non-verbal signals will help you a lot, but you still need to focus on what people are saying. If you focus too much on their body language signals, you and the person may feel uncomfortable. It is useful to be able to read people's body language, but it is useful to learn how to send the right signals and avoid the wrong signals too. Body language may be given several interpretations.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Why did the author change his views about what was the best representation of himself? - after he read Huck Finn his perspective changed - after he read Anne Dillard his perspective changed - not enough information - after he read Tom Sawyer his perspective changed Answer:","completion":"The author changed his views about what was the best representation of himself after reading a quote by Annie Dillard that states, \\"How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives.\\" This quote made the author realize that the way they spent their days, rather than their internal list of characteristics, ultimately determined who they were or how they had spent their life.

The Draags are an alien race which is humanoid in shape but a hundred times larger than humans, with blue skin, fan-like earlobes and huge, protruding red eyes. The Draags also live much longer than human beings one Draag week equals a human year. Some Oms are domesticated as pets, but others run wild, and are periodically exterminated. The Draags' treatment of the Oms is ironically contrasted with their high level of technological and spiritual development.The story opens with a woman running, occasionally looking behind her as if pursued. An enormous hand descends and blocks her way. She runs back the way she came and finds her way blocked by another hand. It becomes apparent that she is being toyed with by entities that do not appreciate her fragility, and as she dies, the infant she has been carrying and attempting to protect begins to cry.The view changes to reveal the Draag children who have accidentally killed the woman; they leave quickly when an adult Draag and child approach. The child voices concern for the orphaned infant, and the two take the child to their home. Tiva (the Draag child) names the infant Terr (word play on \\"terrible\\", same spelling in French; also a homophone for the French \\"Terre\\", meaning Earth).

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 6*q + 137*q + 1287 = 0 for q.","completion":"To solve the given equation 6*q + 137*q + 1287 = 0 for q, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. The equation has two terms containing the variable q, which are 6*q and 137*q. We can combine these two terms. 6*q + 137*q = (6 + 137)*q = 143*q So now the equation becomes: 143*q + 1287 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable q. We want to isolate q on one side of the equation. In order to do this, we will need to subtract 1287 from both sides of the equation. 143*q + 1287 - 1287 = 0 - 1287 This simplifies to: 143*q = -1287 Step 3: Solve for q. Now we have an equation with q isolated on one side. In order to solve for q, we will divide both sides of the equation by 143. 143*q/143 = -1287/143 This results in: q = -1287/143 Step 4: Simplify the fraction. To simplify the fraction -1287/143, we can check if both the numerator and denominator have any common factors. Indeed, both numbers are divisible by 11. -1287 ÷ 11 = -117 143 ÷ 11 = 13 So the simplified fraction is: q = -117/13 Step 5: Divide the fraction. Now we can divide -117 by 13 to find the value of q. q = -117 ÷ 13 q = -9 So the solution to the equation 6*q + 137*q + 1287 = 0 is q = -9."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.

Just a day after this announcement, Fury's licence to box has been temporarily revoked, putting his career on hold as he focuses on his mental health. Step 1: Provide background information on Tyson Fury and his career. Tyson Fury, a British professional boxer, has been making waves in the world of boxing since his debut in 2008. Over the course of his career, Fury has claimed several titles, including the WBA, IBF, WBO, and IBO heavyweight championships. Known for his aggressive fighting style and showmanship, Fury has become a force to be reckoned with in the ring. Step 2: Discuss his decision to give up his world heavyweight titles. On October 10th, Tyson Fury made the decision to give up his heavyweight titles, citing mental health issues as the primary reason. This bold move has been met with mixed reactions from the boxing community, with some people commending Fury for prioritizing his mental well-being, while others express disappointment at the loss of a champion fighter. Step 3: Explain the temporary revocation of Fury's boxing licence. In a surprising turn of events, just one day after Fury gave up his titles, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) temporarily revoked his licence to fight. This decision leaves Fury's future in the sport uncertain, as he will no longer be permitted to compete in professional matches until his licence is reinstated. Step 4: Delve into the boxer's mental health struggles. Fury has been open about his battles with mental health, including depression and substance abuse. In recent interviews, he has discussed the pressures of being a world champion and the toll it has taken on his emotional well-being. In giving up his titles, Fury has made the decision to prioritize his mental health and focus on recovery. Step 5: Discuss reactions from the boxing community and fans. The boxing community has been abuzz with reactions to Fury's difficult decision. Prominent boxing world figures, such as promoter Frank Warren and fellow heavyweight Anthony Joshua, have expressed support for Fury's choice to put his mental health first. Fans of the athlete have also taken to social media to voice their concern and show their support for the fighter. Step 6: Consider the future of Tyson Fury's boxing career. As Tyson Fury steps back from the ring to focus on his well-being, the future of his boxing career remains uncertain. With his licence to box temporarily revoked, Fury's return to the sport will be contingent on the BBBofC's decision to reinstate his boxing privileges. In the meantime, it is crucial that Fury receives the support and understanding from the boxing community as he navigates this challenging period in his life. Conclusion: Tyson Fury's decision to relinquish his world heavyweight titles and focus on his mental health demonstrates the importance of self-care and awareness in an industry that is known for its physical and emotional demands. While boxing will undoubtedly miss one of its brightest stars, Fury's choice to prioritize his personal well-being sets a powerful example, reminding us that even the strongest competitors are human beings with vulnerabilities and struggles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music. \\"Traditional folk music\\" has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - The V Shows is a live album/DVD recorded at the London Astoria by rock band Mostly Autumn. It was recorded on the tour supporting their 2003 release \\"Passengers\\". The DVD for this show was also included in their 2005 DVD release \\"Pink Floyd Revisited\\". Also, this is the first Mostly Autumn release to feature drummer Andrew Jennings. - Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London. They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in the history of popular music. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - Psychedelic music (sometimes psychedelia) covers a range of popular music styles and genres influenced by the 1960s psychedelic culture, a subculture of people who used psychedelic drugs such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline and DMT to experience visual and auditory hallucinations, synesthesia and altered states of consciousness. Psychedelic music attempted to replicate the hallucinogenic experience of using these drugs or enhance the experience of using them. Psychedelic music emerged during the mid-1960s among folk rock and blues rock bands in the United States and Britain. - The London Astoria was a music venue, located at 157 Charing Cross Road, in London, England. It had been leased and run by Festival Republic since 2000. It was closed on 15 January 2009 and has since been demolished. The venue is still seen today as an iconic music establishment, as it helped to launch the careers of many British rock bands and also played a part in the UK success of many international acts. It was also a famous venue in Britain's LGBT scene, for holding London's biggest gay new year parties along with G-A-Y. - Mostly Autumn are an English rock band. The group formed in 1995 and have built their reputation through constant touring, never signing to a major label. They produce music heavily influenced by 1970s progressive rock. According to the BBC, Mostly Autumn \\"fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd with Celtic themes, hard rock and strong, emotional melodies\\". They have also been compared with other progressive bands such as Jethro Tull and Camel, blended with traditional folk music. Later albums also include more contemporary influences. - Pink Floyd Revisited is a live DVD recorded by rock band Mostly Autumn in 2004 . This was a recording of a one - off concert at the Civic Hall in Stratford - Upon - Avon where they played a whole set of Pink Floyd covers . It was only available for a limited period of time and has become quite sought after by Mostly Autumn fans . The V Shows DVD was also included in the same box making it a double DVD set . What is the relationship between 'pink floyd revisited' and 'live album'? A:","completion":"The relationship between 'Pink Floyd Revisited' and 'live album' lies in the fact that 'Pink Floyd Revisited' is a live DVD recorded by the rock band, Mostly Autumn, in 2004. This recording features a one-off concert held at the Civic Hall in Stratford-Upon-Avon, where Mostly Autumn performed a whole set of Pink Floyd covers. The live nature of the concert and the recording makes it a live album, albeit on a DVD format. It is important to note that the DVD for 'Pink Floyd Revisited' was released as a limited edition and has become quite sought after by Mostly Autumn fans. Additionally, the 'V Shows' DVD, another live album/DVD by Mostly Autumn, was also included in the same box, making it a double DVD set. This further establishes the connection between 'Pink Floyd Revisited' and the live album concept, as both DVDs contain performances by the band that were recorded during live concerts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The woman will appear in Burwood Local Court on Monday, March 13. PLEASE WATCH!! Never in my life have I been unfortunate enough to witness such repulsive behavior from one human being to another. Getting in my car at a Macquarie University car park this afternoon I noticed an altercation between a man of middle eastern ethnicity and an Asian woman, pushing and shoving each other, both calling out for help. As myself and another bystander approach the two, we made the shocking discovery that this poor man was actually trying to fight off this woman from his wife, who was sitting inside their car behind him. This deranged woman had the nerve to attack his wife because of the burka she was dressed in, claiming she 'didn't feel safe' around people like her. She was demanding this man show her some form of ID, calling out that she didn't belong here, and that we shouldn't let her walk around freely because we didn't know what she could have hiding under her dress. The whole time this woman was having her rant, her baby was sitting in her unlocked car, meters from where she was hurling abuse. Yes, she had left her infant child in the car to run over and launch herself at an innocent couple minding their business. It makes me feel sick to know we coexist in a world where this happens so frequently, people thinking they have the right to belittle someone else because of their race or religion - to see what absolute shit some people actually have to deal with. Just listen to the garbage she kept repeating!! I'm sorry ma'am, in my opinion the only ones who don't 'belong' here are racist people like yourself who have the nerve to discriminate and abuse innocent people. That is as un-Australian as they come.

Yesterday, a special occasion for my wife and I, with her completing her final exam in her medical science degree. We were super excited to make our way out of the university to go celebrate. However, things took a sudden shift... for the worse. As we were quietly minding our own business, my wife sharing how she aced her exam, there was a lady staring at us … viciously... from a distance. As we entered the car, my wife (who wears an Islamic veil - niqab) decides to smile politely and wave innocently at the lady assuming everything was good... This is where the entire situation just turned upside down. The lady flips it and sticks her middle finger right at us! Me, being completely dumbfounded “Ah, Is everything ok?!”. At this point, she blows up in a rage... starts pointing at my wife and screaming “F**k you! Take it off!!” (referring to my wife’s veil). She then runs towards our car and I urge my wife to lock her door and start recording if anything happens… The video will tell you the rest of the story… she keys my car, pounds on my window and continues to hurl racial and discriminatory slurs at my wife “Take it off! You Muslim Terrorist! Who the f**k are you?” I refused to just brush off the situation knowing that she may harm other people on campus who are identifiably Muslim. I only reacted after she was going to snap off my wipers (it was a rainy day!) I moved the abusive woman away from my wife until several witnesses assisted in the attempt to neutralize her till security came. My wife stopped recording to call security. Here is the witnesses video (http://bit.ly/fb-islamophobia) To make matters worse, after her being forced away by Macquarie uni security (who did an excellent job), did we all suddenly realize she had an infant in the car! Her hate clearly held priority over her child. The abusive woman who, unfortunately, is a student at Macquarie University. I have complete trust that the university they will take the necessary measures to prevent this harm occurring to other students. Unfortunately, this type of Islamophobia isn't isolated to this one individual and incident. Rather, it is an overarching systematic issue in our society that continues to be bred by the propaganda of some media and some politicians. Dehumanizing Muslims. This is the problem.

This glacier is an integral part of the Diablerets Massif, a mountainous area situated in the western Bernese Alps that straddles the cantons of Vaud, Bern, and Valais. The Massif is renowned for its beautiful landscapes, dramatic peaks, and numerous glaciers, offering outdoor enthusiasts spectacular hiking and skiing opportunities all year round. The Glacier des Diablerets, also known as the Diablerets Glacier, extends from the northern slopes of the summit of Les Diablerets, which stands at an impressive altitude of 10,663 feet (3,250 meters) above sea level. It covers an area of approximately 6.3 square miles (16.3 square kilometers) and is the largest ice stream in the Diablerets Massif. The glacier is easily accessible via the town of Les Diablerets, situated on the valley floor and acting as the gateway to the glacier and the surrounding region.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the scientific name of the animal that forms herds of 20 to 300 individuals? The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In December 1974, the crew of the cancelled Apollo 18 mission is informed that it will now proceed as a top secret Department of Defense (DoD) mission disguised as a satellite launch. Commander Nathan Walker, Lieutenant Colonel John Grey, and Captain Ben Anderson are launched toward the Moon to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending ICBM attacks from the USSR. Grey remains in orbit aboard the Freedom command module while Walker and Anderson land on the moon in the lunar module Liberty. While planting one of the detectors, the pair take moon rock samples. After returning to Liberty, the pair hear noises outside and a camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detectors. Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of Liberty despite having secured the samples. During further lunar exploration they discover footprints that lead them to a bloodstained, functioning Soviet LK lander, and a dead cosmonaut in a nearby crater. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence, but he is told only to continue with the mission. The following day the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Their mission complete, the crew prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when Liberty suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to Liberty and non-human tracks that Walker cites as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of his helmet. Walker disappears from view and Anderson finds him unconscious outside of Liberty. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on Walker's chest; Anderson removes a moon rock embedded within him. The pair find themselves unable to contact Houston or Grey due to increased levels of interference from an unknown source.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Terence Steven McQueen was born on March 24, 1930, at St. Francis Hospital in Beech Grove, Indiana, a suburb of Indianapolis. His father, William Terence McQueen, was a stunt pilot for a barnstorming flying circus who left McQueen's mother, Julia Ann (a.k.a. Julian; nee Crawford), six months after meeting her. Several biographers have stated that Julia Ann was an alcoholic. In 1952, with financial assistance provided by the G.I. Bill, McQueen began studying acting in New York at Sanford Meisner's Neighborhood Playhouse. Reportedly, he delivered his first dialogue on a theatre stage in a 1952 play produced by Yiddish theatre star Molly Picon. McQueen's character spoke one brief line: \\"Alts iz farloyrn.\\" (\\"All is lost.\\"). During this time, he also studied acting with Stella Adler in whose class he met Gia Scala. McQueen began to earn money by competing in weekend motorcycle races at Long Island City Raceway and purchased the first of many motorcycles, a Harley-Davidson and Triumph. He soon became an excellent racer, and went home each weekend with about 100 in winnings (equivalent to 900 in 2017). He appeared as a musical judge in an episode of ABC's Jukebox Jury, that aired in the 1953-1954 season. McQueen had minor roles in productions including Peg o' My Heart, The Member of the Wedding, and Two Fingers of Pride. He made his Broadway debut in 1955 in the play A Hatful of Rain, starring Ben Gazzara. In late 1955, at the age of 25, McQueen left New York and headed for California, where he moved into a house on Vestal Avenue in the Echo Park area, seeking acting jobs in Hollywood. When McQueen appeared in a two-part television Westinghouse Studio One presentation entitled The Defenders, Hollywood manager Hilly Elkins (who managed McQueen's first wife, Neile) took note of him and decided that B-movies would be a good place for the young actor to make his mark. He landed his first film role in a bit part in Somebody Up There Likes Me, directed by Robert Wise and starring Paul Newman. McQueen was subsequently hired for the films Never Love a Stranger, The Blob (his first leading role) which depicts a flesh eating amoeba-like space creature, and The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery. McQueen's first breakout role came on television. He appeared on Dale Robertson's NBC western series, Tales of Wells Fargo. Elkins, then McQueen's manager, successfully lobbied Vincent M. Fennelly, producer of the western series Trackdown, to have McQueen read for the part of bounty hunter Josh Randall in a Trackdown episode. McQueen appeared as Randall in the episode, cast opposite series lead and old New York motorcycle racing buddy Robert Culp. McQueen then filmed the pilot episode, which became the series titled Wanted: Dead or Alive, which aired on CBS in September 1958. In 1971 McQueen starred in the poorly received auto-racing drama Le Mans. Then came Junior Bonner in 1972, a story of an aging rodeo rider. He worked for director Sam Peckinpah again with the leading role in The Getaway, where he met future wife Ali MacGraw. He followed this with a physically demanding role as a Devil's Island prisoner in 1973's Papillon, featuring Dustin Hoffman as his character's tragic sidekick. In 1973 The Rolling Stones referred to McQueen in the song \\"Star Star\\" from the album Goats Head Soup for which an amused McQueen reportedly gave personal permission. The lines were \\"Star , star , star , star star/ Yes you are, yes you are, yes you are/Yeah, Ali MacGraw got mad with you/For givin' head to Steve McQueen\\". By the time of The Getaway, McQueen was the world's highest-paid actor, but after 1974's The Towering Inferno, co-starring with his long-time professional rival Paul Newman and reuniting him with Dunaway, became a tremendous box-office success, McQueen all but disappeared from the public eye, to focus on motorcycle racing and traveling around the country in a motor home and on his vintage Indian motorcycles. He did not return to acting until 1978 with An Enemy of the People, playing against type as a bearded, bespectacled 19th-century doctor in this adaptation of a Henrik Ibsen play. The film was never properly released theatrically. His last two films were loosely based on true stories: Tom Horn, a Western adventure about a former Army scout-turned professional gunman who worked for the big cattle ranchers hunting down rustlers, and later hanged for murder in the shooting death of a sheepherder, and The Hunter, an urban action movie about a modern-day bounty hunter, both released in 1980. In 1998 director Paul Street created a commercial for the Ford Puma. Footage was shot in modern-day San Francisco, set to the theme music from Bullitt. Archive footage of McQueen was used to digitally superimpose him driving and exiting the car in settings reminiscent of the film. The Puma shares the same number plate of the classic fastback Mustang used in Bullitt, and as he parks in the garage (next to the Mustang), he pauses and looks meaningfully at a motorcycle tucked in the corner, similar to that used in The Great Escape. In 2005, Ford used his likeness again, in a commercial for the 2005 Mustang. In the commercial, a farmer builds a winding racetrack, which he circles in the 2005 Mustang. Out of the cornfield comes Steve McQueen. The farmer tosses his keys to McQueen, who drives off in the new Mustang. McQueen's likeness was created using a body double (Dan Holsten) and digital editing. Ford secured the rights to McQueen's likeness from the actor's estate licensing agent, GreenLight, for an undisclosed sum. At the Detroit Auto Show in January 2018, Ford unveiled the new 2019 Mustang Bullitt. The company called on McQueen's granddaughter, actress Molly McQueen, to make the announcement. After a brief rundown of the tribute car's particulars, a short film was shown in which Molly was introduced to the actual Bullitt Mustang, a 1968 Mustang Fastback with a 390 cubic-inch engine and a four-speed manual gearbox. That car has been in possession of the same family since 1974 and hidden away from the public until now, when it was driven out from under the press stand and up the center aisle of Ford's booth to much fanfare.

It acknowledges the convenience of the location, but also implies that it's not worth making a special trip for. 2. \\"I ordered a cheese panini and it was just okay.\\" - This sentence has a neutral sentiment, as the reviewer finds the panini to be nothing special or remarkable. 3. \\"The sandwich was haphazardly put together.\\" - This sentence has a negative sentiment, as it indicates that the presentation of the sandwich was unsatisfactory. 4. \\"The bread was just decent and the cheese was just okay.\\" - This sentence has a neutral sentiment, as the reviewer finds both the bread and cheese to be average. 5. \\"The small side of tomato soup was good.\\" - This sentence has a positive sentiment, as the reviewer liked the tomato soup. 6. \\"The fruit side had a chemical taste to it and I just couldn't eat most of it.\\" - This sentence has a negative sentiment, as the reviewer found the fruit to be unpalatable due to a chemical taste. Overall, I would describe the sentiment of this review as leaning towards negative. Although there are some neutral and positive parts, the negative aspects seem to outweigh them.

With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country.

Who won the Booker Prize twice for his novels 'Oscar and Lucinda' and 'True History of the Kelly Gang'?","completion":"The Australian author Peter Carey won the prestigious Booker Prize twice, for his novels 'Oscar and Lucinda' and 'True History of the Kelly Gang.' Peter Carey is among a select few who have achieved this distinction, making him one of the most renowned contemporary writers. 'Oscar and Lucinda,' published in 1988, was Peter Carey's first Booker Prize-winning novel. The book is a historical fiction set in the 19th century, bringing together the lives of two unlikely characters. The plot follows a young English clergyman, Oscar Hopkins, who has a gambling addiction, and an Australian heiress, Lucinda Leplastrier, who shares Oscar's passion for gambling. The story beautifully captures their growing relationship and love as they embark on a risky journey through the Australian Outback. This novel received widespread acclaim for its lyrical prose, rich characterizations, and intriguing narrative, which showcased the author's exceptional storytelling skills. In 2001, Peter Carey received his second Booker Prize for 'True History of the Kelly Gang,' a novel that portrays the life of the legendary Australian outlaw Ned Kelly. The story is presented in the form of a first-person narrative, convincingly told in the voice of Kelly himself, using his distinctive grammatical style. The novel delves into Kelly's difficult upbringing, his strained relationship with his father, his criminal activities, and consequent notoriety. Through this compelling work, Carey humanizes the figure of Ned Kelly, offering readers a nuanced interpretation of his motivations and the social injustices that shaped his life. The novel, much like 'Oscar and Lucinda,' demonstrates Peter Carey's remarkable ability to blend historical accuracy, vivid storytelling, and compelling characters. Peter Carey's dual success at the Booker Prize underlines his talent as a writer and his distinctive voice in modern literature. His novels, while rooted in the historical and social context of Australia, touch on universal themes of love, identity, and the human struggle, which have earned him broad international recognition and acclaim."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus.

Claremore Fire crews responded near the intersection of Archer Dr. and Archer Ct. around 10:30 p.m. to help flooding victims of nearby duplexes. About an hour after they arrived, one firefighter was believed to have stepped into rushing water, which swept him into a storm drain, according to fire officials. The body of Claremore Firefighter Captain Jason Farley was found inside the storm drain around 1 a.m. Sunday, Fox23 reports. Officials suspect Farley drowned, but a medical examiner will determine the cause of death. A second firefighter, Zane James, attempted to save the Captain Farley, but reports say he was also knocked down by the rushing water and had to be rescued. He suffered minor injuries. Report a typo ||||| Daytime heating is helping fuel a resurgence in thunderstorm activity across the beleaguered Plains states on this Sunday afternoon, prompting two tornado watches and concerns for additional flash flooding in areas already hard-hit by up to a foot of rain since Saturday. A destructive, catastrophic flash flood hit a stretch of the Blanco River in and near Wimberley, Texas overnight Saturday night into early Sunday morning, and has since moved downstream into the San Marcos River. Officials estimate that about 1,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed, and at least one person has died. (FORECASTS: Record Rainfall and Flash Flooding | Severe Weather Forecast) Countless water rescues have been reported in Oklahoma and Texas since Saturday, and several tornadoes have been confirmed so far this weekend. (MORE: State by State Coverage of Ongoing Flooding) Here are the latest reports of flooding and severe weather. Across the Region Several tornado watches have been issued in the central U.S. For a map of the latest watches, see the radar maps below the live blog. Severe thunderstorms blew trees onto homes near Marshall, Texas, early Sunday afternoon. The storms damaged an 18-wheeler on nearby Interstate 20. The National Weather Service confirms that a tornado struck the west side of Corpus Christi, Texas, around 1:30 a.m. local time. The agency has not finished its survey and has not yet assigned the damage a rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. The Houston Fire Department responded to the partial collapse of an apartment complex on the city's southwest side early Sunday on Nairn St. Four people were injured, and 10 units sustained severe damage. The National Weather Service says a brief tornado is to blame for the damage, and has given a preliminary EF1 rating to the twister. Lake Texoma is now flowing over the spillway at the Denison Dam, which impounds the Red River to form the lake. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the lake was at 107 percent of its flood control capacity Sunday afternoon, meaning the lake was holding nearly 55 billion gallons more than its full flood-control pool of 1.62 trillion gallons. Lake Texoma is along the Texas-Oklahoma border north of Dallas. Mandatory evacuations were issued for properties below the Lewis Creek Dam west of Willis, Texas, about 50 miles north-northwest of downtown Houston. These were ordered as a precaution given the potential for more heavy rain. A Red Cross shelter was opened at the Lone Star Community Center in Montgomery. At least one swift-water rescue was performed early Sunday morning in Arlington, Texas, where a shopping center was also flooded. A firefighter in Claremore, Oklahoma, died after he was swept away performing a water rescue in the city early Sunday. A few houses were flooded in the city. Multiple high-water rescues were reported Sunday morning in Venus, Texas (Johnson County), in the south Dallas-Ft. Worth metroplex. Farther south, rescues were also performed in the cities of Uvalde, D'hanis and Yancy, Texas. High water was reported on Interstate 20 in both directions near Carrier Parkway in Grand Prairie Sunday morning, west of downtown Dallas. Numerous roads remained closed as of early Sunday morning in Ellis County, Texas. Part of a block of county road 1418 near Covington, Texas was reported to be partially washed out Sunday morning. Catastrophic Flash Flood near San Marcos, Texas At least one man has died in San Marcos, Texas, as a result of the catastrophic flash flood that developed on the Blanco River late Saturday night before emptying into the San Marcos River Sunday morning. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency late Sunday morning for the San Marcos River from San Marcos to Luling, Texas. This included parts of southeastern Hays, western Caldwell and northern Guadalupe counties. San Marcos is a city of about 55,000 people between Austin and San Antonio. A surge of floodwater continues to roll downstream along the San Marcos River into Luling, Texas. The San Marcos River is rising fast in Martindale and Luling, Texas. Palmetto State Park at Ottine is experiencing severe flooding with at least 6 feet of water in the pavilion building likely, based on Sunday afternoon's NWS river stage report. Much of the Luling Golf Course is likely to flood, and some of the lowest homes north and northeast of the golf course may flood depending on exactly how high the river gets. A curfew has been declared beginning at 9 p.m. Sunday and ending at 7 a.m. Monday for the cities of San Marcos and Wimberley, Texas, as well as unincorporated areas of Hays County. An estimated 1,000 homes have been flooded in Hays County, Texas. Some residents are still stranded in their homes, but officials said Sunday afternoon that there are no longer any people waiting on rooftops for rescue. Up to 12.32 inches of rain fell near Kendalia, Texas in this event. The Blanco River at San Marcos, Texas, crested just over 43 feet early Sunday morning, a rise of over 31 feet since late Saturday night. That 31-foot surge in the river level included a rise of 17 feet in just 30 minutes. Water levels remain high this morning as the flood crest rolls downstream. The Blanco River rose more than 33 feet in just 3 hours in Wimberley, Texas, reaching a level more than 27 feet above flood stage at 1 a.m. Sunday. This broke the all-time record crest from 1929 by nearly 7 feet, before the river gauge stopped reporting. Wimberley is about 25 miles southwest of Austin. Emergency management reported residents were trapped on rooftops due to the sudden rise in floodwaters. Officials opened shelters to house those forced from their homes by the swollen river.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials? is inside the article: Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands. Drummer Terry Bozzio became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and..., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"The first name of the person who prevented Zappa from having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials is Herb. This is evident from the information provided in the article which states, \\"Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976.\\" It was Herb Cohen who was involved in the legal disputes that led to Zappa being unable to access his previously recorded material during the trials."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The premise tells us the following information: 1. Many trees come from nurseries, specifically from locations like Missouri. 2. These trees from Missouri and other such places are brought down to this particular area. 3. When the trees are brought to the local nurseries in this area, they will leaf out, which means they will produce new leaves or replace old leaves with new growth. 4. The speaker notes that they are transplanting already leafed-out trees. Based on this information, we can infer that some, if not many, trees in this area are not native and are brought from external nurseries, both within and potentially outside of the state. However, the premise does not provide enough information to conclude that all trees in the area have exclusively originated from local nurseries. There might be trees that naturally germinate in the wild, or trees that are brought in from other nurseries beyond Missouri. It's important to consider the possibility of different tree species, some of which might be endemic to the region, while others may be introduced by humans or travel naturally through bird or animal activity. Additionally, the speaker's knowledge might not encompass the entire scope of tree origins in the area. In conclusion, while the premise provides some insight into the origin of some trees in the area, it does not entail the hypothesis \\"I know for a fact that all of the trees here originated from local nurseries.\\" The information given is not sufficient to confirm the exclusive origin of all trees in the area, and as such, the hypothesis remains unproven."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During finals week, students are usually stressed and busy studying for their exams. They often reside in dormitories or accommodation facilities close to their educational institutions, where they have their individual rooms. Hallways are the common passageways linking these individual rooms, functioning as a shared space where students move around and interact. A \\"do not disturb\\" sign is typically used to communicate the desire for privacy and minimum distractions. In this case, the student seeking solitude during finals week would place this sign outside their room, specifically in the hallway. This placement ensures that people passing by or fellow students residing in nearby rooms will see the sign and understand the student's need for privacy and focus during the critical period. In contrast, options like \\"store window,\\" \\"public place,\\" and \\"shop window\\" don't quite align with the context since they are mostly unrelated to a student's living space and don't represent an appropriate location for placing personal \\"do not disturb\\" sign.

Despite the share pop, Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, said the sentiment from investors has been largely negative due to Snap’s expensive valuation compared with its revenue. The app launched in 2011, but generated no revenue until 2015. While advertising efforts have ramped up since, with total revenue reaching 404.5 million in 2016, the company is paying far more to keep the service running and generating huge net losses. Still, Snapchat is the first major venture-backed technology IPO of 2017, after the number of such offerings plummeted in 2016, and investors wanted to get in on it, he said. “I think people just want to get in and say, ‘Hey, what’s the worst that can happen?,’” Rao said. First Take: Snap’s high price and big pop mean nothing In a sense, it is nice to see investors excited about a new issue, said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, a manager of IPO-focused exchange-traded funds. But given the large share move alongside the high valuation, she too feels investors may not have fully evaluated the company’s fundamentals. “It’s the kind of first day pop that suggests some sort irrational exuberance,” Smith said. Investors last year were more cautious, as the average IPO priced below the midpoint of the range and had an average one-day pop of 5%, according to Renaissance Capital. Don’t miss: Two views of Snapchat: An app that has peaked or a platform set to blossom Snapchat has grabbed the attention of a generation of younger smartphone users, who post and share photos and videos on the app that can disappear after a set amount of time. The app—developed by Stanford University students, two of whom are still executives at Snap—had 158 million daily active users as of December 2016, according to the company’s prospectus. Snap has big plans for the future, though. The first hardware offering from the company—Snapchat Spectacles, sunglasses that have a small camera installed and can upload video to the app—launched last year, and executives described Snap as “a camera company” in the run-up to the IPO. The app also has a payments feature called Snapcash. Read also: Snapchat founders, investors cash out nearly 1 billion in IPO Future innovations, whether it be in cameras or in additions to its social platform, are what investors were buying into, according to Ethan Kurzweil, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “You’re counting on them to come up with something that will reignite their growth,” Kurzweil said. Snap will have to fend off rivals for its core business as it attempts to develop new sources of revenue. The company admitted in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it experienced “increased competition” in 2016, which many understood as an acknowledgment that Facebook Inc.’s FB, +0.52% Instagram Stories offering had managed to steal traffic away from Snapchat’s feature that is also called Stories. See also: How Snap stacks up against Facebook and Twitter The competition from Instagram, as well as the recent uptick in the market, likely played into Snap’s decision to go public at this time, Rao said. “I think what they decided was Instagram is coming on strong, they’re copying everything that we have and it was stealing the thunder a little bit,” Rao said. Snap initially set a price range of 14 to 16 for the Class A common shares it sold in the IPO, which don't have voting rights, a rare and potentially unprecedented move. The Snap co-founders who are still with the company, Chief Executive Evan Spiegel and Chief Technology Officer Bobby Murphy, will together control more than 88% of voting power in the company thanks to that move.

There were only 21 U.S. tech IPOs last year, according to global IPO investment adviser Renaissance Capital, which said 2016 was the worst year for IPO returns since 2003 and had the lowest number of offerings since 2009. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were the lead underwriters on the offering. ||||| Snap's cofounders, Evan Spiegel, 26, and Robert Murphy, 28, rang the opening bell on the exchange earlier Thursday. Lucas Jackson/Reuters Snap Inc. surged in its debut as a publicly traded company Thursday, after raising a greater than expected 3.4 billion in an initial public offering. Shares of Snapchat's parent company opened for trading at 24, up about 41% from the IPO price of 17 apiece. At the opening price, Snap had a valuation of about 33 billion. The stock closed at 24.48, up 44%. Snap's cofounders, Evan Spiegel, 26, and Robert Murphy, 28, rang the opening bell on the exchange earlier Thursday. At the IPO price, Spiegel's stake in the company is worth at least 4.5 billion. Murphy's stake in Snap is valued at closer to 3.9 billion. The shares opened for trading at 11:19 a.m. after a period of \\"price discovery\\" during which traders on the floor of the exchange try to corral demand for the stock. Speaking on the floor of the exchange, Glenn Carell, director of NYSE floor operations for Global Trading Systems, said the price discovery took a long time because of heavy demand from buyers who didn't get allocations they wanted in the IPO itself. Carell expects the stock to end its first day of trading around 24 or 25 a share. Snap's is the first tech IPO of the year, the first offering from a social network since Twitter went public, and the largest tech deal since Alibaba went public in 2014. Lucas Jackson/Reuters It is going public at an opportune time. Stock benchmarks hit record highs on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing above the 21,000 mark for the first time. Since it was launched in 2011, Snapchat has matured from a \\"sexting app\\" to one that still deletes messages by default, but is a viable competitor to companies like Facebook and Twitter. According to its IPO prospectus, it posted a net loss of 514.6 million in 2016 and warned that it may never be able to achieve or maintain profitability. It earned 404.4 million in revenue in 2016, up from 58.6 million in 2015. Snap is \\"significantly overvalued given the likely scale of its long-term opportunity and the risks associated with executing against that opportunity,\\" said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, in a note on Thursday. He rated the stock a \\"sell\\" with a 10 price target. During the roadshow, investors raised questions about the slowdown in the rate of active users, and how much potential Snapchat has as an advertising platform. Snap said its biggest revenue opportunity is the growing budget for worldwide mobile advertising, which could reach 196 billion by 2020 from 66 billion now. \\"Snapchat's slowing user growth ultimately caps its long-term revenue opportunity,\\" said Anthony DiClemente, a Nomura analyst who sees 6% downside to the stock, in a note. Snap's stock is listed under the ticker SNAP.

Answer based on context: In week 4, the Lions traveled south to Arlington, Texas to take on the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys dominated the first half, putting the Lions in a big hole for the second straight week. First came a 25-yard touchdown catch by Dez Bryant. In the second quarter, Bryant scored again on a 6-yard touchdown catch. Dallas added more points with a 41-yard field goal by Dan Bailey. The Lions then got their only points of the first half with a 33-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Cowboys responded with a 35-yard field goal just before halftime. After the break, Dallas added more points with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Jason Witten, putting them up 27-3. The Lions responded with two consecutive defensive touchdowns: first a 34-yard interception return by Bobby Carpenter, then a 56-yard pick-6 by Chris Houston. The Cowboys scored their final points of the game with a 23-yard field goal late in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Lions continued their comeback with a 23-yard touchdown catch by Calvin Johnson. They made it a three-point game with a 51-yard field goal by Jason Hanson, then Romo threw an interception to Stephen Tulloch, and took their first lead of the game late in the final quarter when Calvin Johnson caught his second touchdown of the game from 2 yards out to become only the second player in NFL history to record at least two touchdown catches in 4 straight games (the other to do so is former Vikings receiver Cris Carter). The Lions defense held off Dallas for the win. Like the previous week, the Lions came back and won it in the final moments of the game after being down by a large margin at halftime.

To elaborate, the review contains numerous components that add up to a negative sentiment overall. Firstly, the initial statement, \\"This place sucks,\\" clearly sets a negative tone. Following this, the reviewer questions the choice of staying at the Mirage among all the places in Las Vegas, again suggesting a lack of satisfaction. Their lodging was not a choice, but a compromise they had to make due to a conference, which further underlines their dissatisfaction. Secondly, the customer experience appears to be very poor according to this review. The reviewer was treated rudely by a casino boss when simply passing through the casino with their child, which would clearly add to negative feelings about the hotel. Additionally, the amenities were not as expected or as promoted. The pool that the reviewer's daughter was looking forward to using was empty, and the Jacuzzi, another related amenity, was not only cold but surrounded by trash in form of cigar butts and ashes. This shows an evident lack of maintenance and significantly detracts from the reviewer's experience. The reviewer also mentions damage to their vehicle that happened under the Valet's care. Not only did this issue occur, but the hotel reportedly took no responsibility for it, which suggests poor customer service and added to the reviewer's negative experience and sentiment. Lastly, the poor review of the hotel also extends to an overall negative view of Las Vegas, describing it as a place for drunk people, indicating the whole trip was disappointing. Overall, the reviewer presents a litany of complaints without mentioning any redeeming qualities or positive aspects of the Mirage or their trip, squarely placing the overall sentiment of this review in the negative category."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Background: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: For all collisions in a closed system, momentum is conserved. In some collisions in a closed system, kinetic energy is conserved. When both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved, the collision is called an elastic collision. Most collisions are inelastic because some amount of kinetic energy is converted to potential energy, usually by raising one of the objects higher (increasing gravitation PE) or by flexing the object. Any denting or other changing of shape by one of the objects will also be accompanied by a loss of kinetic energy. The only commonly seen elastic collisions are those between billiard balls or ball bearings, because these balls do not compress. And, of course, collisions between molecules are elastic if no damage is done to the molecules.

Tesla is finding it 's a long hard road out of production hell. The electric car maker relieved some investors and customers when it said it is sticking to its latest Model 3 production targets. But some analysts still question exactly where Tesla is in its production ramp and are concerned that its targets may be too aggressive. \\"The data point everyone wants we didn't get â current Model 3 run rate \\" RBC analyst Joseph Spak said in a note Wednesday after the company reported earnings that beat analyst expectations. Tesla had originally aimed to be making 5 000 Model 3 cars per week by the end of 2017 but the company has changed that deadline twice. On Wednesday the company reiterated reaching 5 000 by the end of the second quarter and set a smaller goal of 2 500 per week by the end of the first quarter.

Solve -23*j + 20*j + 9 = 0 for j.","completion":"To solve the given equation -23j + 20j + 9 = 0 for the variable j, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms First, we can combine the terms with the variable j: -23j + 20j = -3j So, the equation becomes: -3j + 9 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable j Now, we need to isolate j. To do this, we can move the constant term (+9) to the other side of the equation. We'll do this by subtracting 9 from both sides: -3j + 9 - 9 = 0 - 9 -3j = -9 Step 3: Solve for j Finally, we will solve for j by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of j, which is -3: j = (-9) / (-3) Dividing both sides by -3: j = 3 Thus, the solution to the equation -23j + 20j + 9 = 0 is j = 3."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paul and Jessica are killed, but Sarah survives. One year later, Sarah and her friends Juno, Beth, Sam (MyAnna Buring), Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), and newcomer Holly (Nora-Jane Noone) are reunited at a cabin in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. While spelunking, Juno apologises to Sarah for not being there for her after the accident, but Sarah is distant. As the group moves through a passage, it collapses behind them, trapping them.

The given equation is : a - 16 = -7*a You are supposed to find 'a'. First, you want to get the variables on the same side of the equation. I will add 7a to both sides of the equation to keep 'a' positive. a + 7a - 16 = -7*a + 7a which simplifies to: 8a - 16 = 0 Now to isolate 'a', we will add 16 to both sides of the equation: 8a = 16 Finally, the aim is to find the value of 'a' so we'll divide both sides of the equation by 8: a = 16/8 So, your final answer is a = 2. Meaning the value that solves the equation a - 16 = -7*a is a = 2. To check this, we can substitute the value of 'a' back into the original equation: 2 - 16 = -7 * 2 -14 = -14 As the LHS equals to RHS, therefore 'a' = 2 is indeed the solution to the equation a - 16 = -7*a."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Dubbed the \\"King of Pop\\", he was one of the most popular entertainers in the world, and was the best-selling music artist during the year of his death. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion along with his publicized personal life made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. Jackson was influenced by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: \\"Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I had never seen a performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life because of James Brown.\\" Jackson owed his vocal technique in large part to Diana Ross, especially his use of the oooh interjection, which he used from a young age; Ross had used this effect on many of the songs recorded with the Supremes. Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He said: \\"I got to know her well. She taught me so much. I used to just sit in the corner and watch the way she moved. She was art in motion. I studied the way she moved, the way she sang - just the way she was.\\" He told her: \\"I want to be just like you, Diana.\\" She said: \\"You just be yourself.\\" According to choreographer David Winters, who met and befriended Jackson while choreographing the 1971 Diana Ross TV special Diana!, Jackson watched the musical West Side Story almost every week, and it was his favorite film; he paid tribute to it in \\"Beat It\\" and the \\"Bad\\" video.

In early 1701, Louis registered Philip's claim to the French throne with the Paris Parlement, raising the possibility of union with Spain, contrary to Charles' will. In February, the Spanish-controlled Duchies of Milan and Mantua in Northern Italy announced their support for Philip and accepted French troops. Combined with efforts to build an alliance between France and Imperial German states in Swabia and Franconia, these were challenges Leopold could not ignore. At the same time, French garrisons took over Dutch-held 'Barrier' fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands, helped by the Spanish Viceroy and French ally Max Emanuel of Bavaria. This undid Dutch gains made at Ryswick and threatened their lucrative monopoly over the Scheldt granted by the 1648 Peace of Münster. It was also a concern to English merchants since control of the ports of Antwerp and Ostend would allow France to blockade the Channel at will. In response, Leopold, the Dutch Republic and Britain signed the Treaty of The Hague on 7 September 1701 renewing the 1689 Grand Alliance. Provisions included securing the Dutch Barrier in the Spanish Netherlands, the Protestant succession in England and Scotland and an independent Spain but made no reference to placing Archduke Charles on the Spanish throne. When the Stuart exile James II died on 16 September, Louis reneged on his commitment at Ryswick to recognise William as King by proclaiming James Francis Edward King of England and Scotland. The vast majority in Britain now supported war and after William's death on 19 March 1702, Queen Anne announced the continuation of his policies ie ensuring the Protestant succession and resisting French expansion. The Dutch did the same and on 15 May the Grand Alliance declared war on France, followed by the Imperial Diet on 30 September. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Next, the premise notes, \\"the Kentuckian had never been one to put off the inevitable with a pallid hope that something would turn up to save him.\\" From this statement, we can infer that the character referenced, \\"the Kentuckian,\\" generally does not avoid issues or challenges, especially those that are inevitable - in this case, he doesn't rely on the thin possibility that circumstances may change and save him from the ordeal. 3. While the premise doesn't refer to the size or magnitude of the issue directly, the intensity with which it describes the unlikelihood of avoiding or deferring the ordeal implies that it is indeed significant. On the basis of these observations, we can reasonably conclude that the hypothesis \\"The issue was simply too large to avoid.\\" is true. While the premise does not explicitly discuss the size of the issue, it can be inferred from the urgent, inescapable nature of the predicament that the issue at hand is substantial and unavoidable. So, although the premise doesn't state this directly, it aligns with and gives good ground to accept the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Mike was reading about an instrument that could measure gravity, gravimeter. He then found how gravimeter was used to measure the gravitational field of the Moon. He read about two distinct cases where the Moon's gravitational field was measured on earth, side A and side B. In side A the Moon's gravity was measured from the side where the Earth was facing the Moon. And in side B the Moon's gravitational field was measured from the opposite side of the Earth. He found these two locations showed very different consequences of Moon's gravitational field. On which side the Moon's gravitational field would exert weaker force, side A side B? Hint: Because the gravitational field created by the Moon weakens with distance from the Moon, it exerts a slightly stronger than average force on the side of the Earth facing the Moon, and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side. The Moon thus tends to \\"stretch\\" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally. As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium—there is never time for the fluid to \\"catch up\\" to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant—the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. Now, I have a new situation: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop. Answer this question please: Would crop A need less or more number of chemicals than crop B? Answer:","completion":"Crop A would need less number of chemicals than crop B due to its herbicide tolerance. This is because genetically engineered herbicide tolerance allows crop A to grow effectively while resisting the negative effects of herbicides that target weeds. Since crop A can withstand the herbicides, farmers would not need to apply multiple chemicals, including various herbicides and other agents, to protect the crop from harm and to control different types of weeds throughout the growing season. In contrast, crop B, which lacks herbicide tolerance, would require the use of multiple herbicides for effective weed management. The farmers would need to apply different chemicals at various stages of growth, as well as performing mechanical and hand weeding to control weeds that are not affected by the chemicals. Moreover, crop B is also more susceptible to harm caused by the herbicides, which might hinder its growth and productivity. In summary, the introduction of Dan's genetically-engineered herbicide-tolerant crop, crop A, has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during the growing season. This would not only result in cost savings for the farmers but also lead to increased crop yields due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. Therefore, crop A would require a lower number of chemicals than crop B, making it a more beneficial and sustainable choice for farmers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: HONG KONG -- Hong Kong Disneyland is too crowded, a senior Chinese tourism official said today, hinting that another Disney Park is necessary to accommodate demand from China's huge population. The comments by Shao Qiwei, director of China's State Administration of Tourism, came a day after Shanghai's mayor Han Zheng said the city was preparing to build China's second Disney theme park. \\"China has a very large population. We now have 1.3 billion people. The market is very large. As far as I know, Hong Kong Disneyland is now very crowded,\\" said Shao, whose comments were broadcast on Hong Kong's Cable TV. The Hong Kong theme park, which opened in September, was widely criticized in January when it turned away hundreds of Lunar New Year holiday makers from mainland China because the park was full. Chaos erupted when angry crowds tried to force their way into the park. The embarrassing incident prompted a public apology from Hong Kong Disneyland Managing Director Bill Ernest and a dressing down from Hong Kong's leader Donald Tsang. Authorities are carefully studying the issue of overcrowding in preparation for the possible building of the Disney park in Shanghai, Shao said. The official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday that no agreement has been reached on the park in Shanghai, quoting senior vice president of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, Leslie Goodman. Hong Kong Disneyland is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and the local government, which shouldered the bulk of the park's construction fees.

Alex Rodriguez may have to start serving a suspension as soon as it is announced rather than wait for a grievance to play out. FILE - In this July 15, 2013, file photo, New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez heads out to batting practice before a Class AA baseball game with the Trenton Thunder against the Reading Phillies... (Associated Press) FILE - In this June 22, 2010, file photo, New York Yankees' Alex Rodriguez warms up before batting during a baseball game against the Arizona Diamondbacks in Phoenix. After a week's worth of high drama,... (Associated Press) Major League Baseball may try to suspend A-Rod under its collective bargaining agreement instead of its drug rules, which would eliminate any chance of delaying a penalty until after the case goes to an arbitrator, The Associated Press has learned. Rodriguez has never been disciplined for a drug offense, and a first offender under baseball's Joint Drug Agreement is entitled to an automatic stay if the players' association files a grievance _ meaning the penalty is put on hold until after an arbitrator rules. While use of banned performance-enhancing substances falls under the drug agreement, MLB may argue other alleged violations are punishable under the labor contract, a person familiar with management's deliberations told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity because no statements were authorized. Taking that action would prevent the New York Yankees third baseman from returning to the field, even if he recovers from a quadriceps injury cited by the team as the reason for keeping him on the disabled list. And merely threatening to use that provision might give MLB leverage to force a deal. The Yankees expect Rodriguez to be accused of recruiting other athletes for the clinic, of attempting to obstruct MLB's investigation, and of not being truthful with MLB in the past when he discussed his relationship with Dr. Anthony Galea, who pleaded guilty two years ago to a federal charge of bringing unapproved drugs into the United States from Canada. Four years ago, Rodriguez admitted using PEDs while with Texas from 2001-03. He has repeatedly denied using them since. Baseball has been investigating Rodriguez and other players since a January report in the Miami New Times alleging they received PEDs from Biogenesis of America, a closed anti-aging clinic on Florida. \\"We're still involved in the process of preparing for an eventual appeal in this matter,\\" Rodriguez's lawyer, David Cornwell, said Monday on ESPN New York Radio. \\"My understanding is that the next step that is going to be taken is that the players' association and baseball will meet to discuss the investigation and baseball's focus on particular players. So we'll see how that process plays out. But at this point my understanding or my expectation is that we're going to be working through the process towards an appeal.\\" Cornwell did not return an email seeking comment. Aside from the drug agreement, there is no automatic stay for suspensions under baseball's labor contract. Rodriguez could be punished under Article XII (B) of the Basic Agreement, which states: \\"Players may be disciplined for just cause for conduct that is materially detrimental or materially prejudicial to the best interests of baseball including, but not limited to, engaging in conduct in violation of federal, state or local law.\\" If suspended under that section, Rodriguez would serve the penalty while a grievance is litigated before arbitrator Fredric Horowitz _ unless the union asks for a stay and the arbitrator grants one, which would be unusual under the grievance procedure. And baseball could always try to punish A-Rod on drug violations later. It would be difficult for Commissioner Bud Selig to remove the arbitrator from the process. A provision in Article XI gives the commissioner permission to rule instead of the arbitrator on a complaint \\"involving the preservation of the integrity of, or the maintenance of public confidence in, the game of baseball.\\" But a letter from Selig that is Attachment 1 states: \\"I understand that the players' association has expressed concern that the commissioner might take some action pursuant to Article XI (A) (1) (b) of the Basic Agreement which could negate rights of players under the new Basic Agreement. While I have difficulty seeing that this is a real problem, I am quite willing to assure the association that the commissioner will take no such action.\\" In addition, if Selig attempted to bypass the arbitrator, the union would have the right to reopen the labor contract with respect to that provision. Cornwell would not respond to a report in the New York Daily News on Monday that said Selig would not pursue a lifetime ban if Rodriguez accepted a suspension through 2014. \\"There's been all sorts of reports, all sorts of sources and all sorts of breaking news and breathless coverage, and I don't feel any need to respond to any of it,\\" Cornwell told ESPN. In announcing Ryan Braun's 65-game suspension last week, MLB cited violations of both the labor contract and drug agreement. A person familiar with that deal, speaking on condition of anonymity because no statements were authorized, said 50 games of the penalty for the 2011 NL MVP were connected to Biogenesis. The additional 15 games stemmed from the Milwaukee outfielder's actions during the grievance that overturned his October 2011 positive test for testosterone. Cornwell represented Braun in the 2012 hearing before arbitrator Shyam Das, but said he was not involved in Braun's agreement to be suspended. Rodriguez, who turned 38 Saturday, has not played this season following hip surgery in January. The three-time AL MVP, fifth on the career list with 647 home runs, appeared to be on the verge of rejoining New York on July 22, but the Yankees said a day earlier that an MRI revealed a strained quadriceps. Rodriguez pushed to be activated last Friday, but the Yankees said he wouldn't even resume a minor league injury rehabilitation assignment until Aug. 1. Rodriguez then went on a New York radio station to criticize the team's decision. The Miami New Times story was prompted by information provided by Porter Fischer, an ex-Biogenesis employee. \\"What's been made public are various documents that a disgruntled ex-employee of Biogenesis allegedly stole. I would imagine we'll spend time talking with the arbitrators about the documents and things of that nature, their authenticity, their relevancy, the reliability,\\" Cornwell told ESPN. Gary Smith, a spokesman for Fischer, responded in an email: \\"Cornwell can get in line with many others who want to attack Porter Fischer for exposing the truth and is left without support. He did it because it was the right thing to do.\\" Also Monday, Toronto manager John Gibbons said he thinks Blue Jays outfielder Melky Cabrera won't be penalized. Cabrera, MVP of the 2012 All-Star game, was banned for 50 games last year for a positive testosterone test while with San Francisco. \\"We don't think anything's going to happen,\\" Gibbons said. \\"We think, because he served his time, it's over with. I haven't given it much thought and the GM hasn't talked much about it.\\" ___ AP Baseball Writer Janie McCauley and AP Sports Writer Tim Reynolds contributed to this report. ||||| After Alex Rodriguez's lawyer said his client would fight any discipline from Major League Baseball, a source familiar with discussions told ESPN's \\"Outside the Lines\\" Wednesday that A-Rod's representatives are now negotiating a possible settlement that could result in a lengthy suspension. The source said MLB officials have told Rodriguez's attorneys that they are willing to ban him for life, although sources said it was not clear commissioner Bud Selig was prepared to make such a move, knowing Rodriguez would fight it in arbitration. Several sources have told \\"Outside the Lines\\" that some MLB officials have pushed for a lifetime ban, saying they would rather force Rodriguez to defend himself than agree to a suspension that allows him play while he appeals. Rodriguez was presented with MLB's evidence in recent days, detailing what sources said were \\"volumes\\" of documents establishing a connection between Rodriguez and Biogenesis clinic founder Tony Bosch. Sources said MLB was also given evidence supporting accusations that Rodriguez attempted to coerce at least one witness in MLB's investigation. That accusation is the basis of MLB's argument that Rodriguez may be punished for his conduct, in addition to multiple violations of the game's joint drug agreement. MLB is apparently hoping that Rodriguez will accept a lengthy suspension that could keep him off the field through at least next season, without the time and trouble of an arbitration hearing.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which village observed increased yields because of the arthropods? Two neighboring villages practiced extensive agriculture for their food supply. Leaf village used the intentional cultivation of arthropods to help them get better harvests. Tree village didn't do that, they used conventional methods of growing their crops and got smaller harvests but used arthropods for food. Hint: The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept. However, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination. Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35% of the world’s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields. More than 3,500 species of native bees pollinate crops. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators, including birds and bats and arthropods like bees, butterflies and moths, and beetles and other insects.

On April 5, 1946, the entire cast, including Stafford and Perry Como, participated in the first commercial radio broadcast from an airplane. The initial plan was to use the stand-held microphones used in studios but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held microphones, which because of the plane's cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; a rehearsal in the afternoon, then two in the evening—one for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.Stafford moved from New York to California in November 1946, continuing to host Chesterfield Supper Club from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances on the show to Tuesdays, and Peggy Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with Chesterfield Supper Club, Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the programme, suggested using some of the folk music for the show. With her renewed interest in folk tunes came an interest in folklore; Stafford established a contest to award a prize to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Question: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. Rob is a chemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to devise a technique that would be able to control chemical reactions. For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A. In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B. In which reactants the particles would collide with greater force, reactant A or reactant B? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's analyze the information given step-by-step: 1.

Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London. Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. Critic Greil Marcus remarked, \\"John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock.\\" The album featured the song \\"Mother\\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \\"Working Class Hero\\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \\"you're still fucking peasants\\", fell foul of broadcasters. In January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \\"Power to the People\\". In his lyrics to the song, Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach he had espoused in \\"Revolution\\", although he later disowned the message, saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved with Ali in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as \\"disgusting fascism\\", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \\"God Save Us/Do the Oz\\" and joined marches in support of the magazine. Eager for a major commercial success, Lennon adopted a more accessible sound for his next album, Imagine (1971). Rolling Stone reported that \\"it contains a substantial portion of good music\\" but warned of the possibility that \\"his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant\\".

Question: Here's a logic test: Mike knows that a train is slower then a plane. If he rides both vehicles for 40 minutes, which will have taken him a lesser distance? (A) train (B) plane Choose the answer between \\"train\\" and \\"plane\\". Answer:","completion":"The answer to this logic test is \\"train\\". Since Mike knows that a train is slower than a plane, it can be inferred that he will travel a lesser distance in the same amount of time on the train compared to the plane. When Mike rides both the train and the plane for 40 minutes, the key factor to consider is the speed of each vehicle, which determines how far they travel in a given time period. Planes generally travel at a higher speed compared to trains. Hence, in this scenario, the plane will cover a greater distance in 40 minutes relative to the train. To further elaborate on this, let's consider the following theoretical example using the formula for distance (distance = speed x time): Assume that the train travels at a speed of 60 mph, while the plane travels at a speed of 500 mph. If both vehicles are ridden for 40 minutes (which is equivalent to 2/3 hours), the distance covered by each would be: - Train: distance = 60 mph x (2/3) hours = 40 miles - Plane: distance = 500 mph x (2/3) hours = 333.33 miles As we can see from this example, the plane covers a significantly greater distance in the same amount of time as the train. Therefore, the train will have taken Mike a lesser distance compared to the plane during the 40-minute journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - earth - country - pack - organization - army Explain why a human would choose \\"country\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"country\\" as the answer to the question, \\"What is a person the leader of after they are inaugurated?\\" because an inauguration typically pertains to the formal investiture or installation of an individual into a high public office or position of authority. In this context, an inauguration most commonly refers to the ceremony wherein a president, prime minister, or other head of state assumes office. Therefore, the term is most associated with political roles that involve the leadership of a country. Here's a brief explanation of why the other options are less fitting: 1. Earth: While some leaders may have significant international influence, no single individual is inaugurated to lead the entire Earth. There is no centralized global government, and leadership roles are typically conferred within the framework of individual countries or their subsidiary political divisions. 2. Pack: The term \\"pack\\" often refers to a group of animals, such as wolves or dogs, and is not regularly applied to human social structures, especially with regard to political leadership. An inauguration is a formal human ceremony, so \\"pack\\" is not a suitable answer in this context. 3. Organization: While the term \\"organization\\" could apply to a political party or government entity, it is a more general term and does not specifically refer to a nation or country. While some leaders may be inaugurated to lead organizations, the assumption in this question is that the person is taking on a leadership role at a national level, making \\"country\\" the more appropriate choice. 4. Army: An army is a branch of a nation's military, and the leader of an army would be a military officer who has attained their position through military service and promotion rather than political appointment or election. While some political leaders may also hold military titles, the focus of the question is on the political role they assume after inauguration, which would more accurately correspond to leadership of the country. Given this rationale, a human would choose \\"country\\" as the answer because it is the most appropriate and accurate reflection of the leadership role and scope of responsibility assumed by an individual after being inaugurated. An inauguration ceremony represents the peaceful and orderly transfer of power within a governance system, and the person being inaugurated becomes responsible for the policies, actions, and well-being of their country during their term in office."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He said “I’m going to fail this class anyway, so I have other things to do.” It was true that he wasn’t doing well, and we had addressed this previously, but his attitude was completely defeatist. He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime. You already know that. You can email me. It’s my job to help you understand, but you have to come to me. You are an adult. It would be very inappropriate of me to follow you around, inviting you to office hours. And you must do the homework and the labs.” He stayed for the lab. I notified his counselor about what was going on, and she called him in and said the same things that I said. Next class he moved from the seat at the edge of my peripheral vision, to the middle, started working his ass off, and he passed. For a while I thought he was closing in on a C, but he got his D and graduated. And I didn’t give him anymore of a grading break than I give any of my students.

I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again.

More than 40,000 properties in the North East - 3.8% of the area's housing stock - are empty, compared with more than 600,000 nationally. Twelve councils in the region have formed a group to reduce the number. Empty Property Forum chair Susan Cousins said vacant homes were a \\"waste of a valuable resource\\". \\"We work with the owners to find out why the house is empty and provide the advice and support they need to bring their property back into use,\\" she said. \\"But, if we can't find an owner, or if they refuse to talk to us, we will consider taking enforcement action.\\" Properties have been left empty because of negative equity, unaffordable repairs, inheritance and a growing private rented sector, the council said. More than 200,000 homes in England - and 20,00 in the North East - have been unoccupied for longer than six months. Northumberland County Council cabinet member for housing, Allan Hepple, said this could have \\"a negative influence on the sustainability of an area\\". Thirty privately rented homes that have been empty for two years or more will be repaired using a Â£750,000 government grant, the council said. They will be chosen according to cost of repair, housing need and the impact of them remaining empty. Some will be bought and rented out by the council.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Write some highlights for the following article: Congress' inaction to extend unemployment benefits to millions of struggling Americans is not only irresponsible policy, it is morally wrong. The economy is getting better for some, but the tragic effects of reckless public policy and deregulation spurred by the disproportionate political influence of big money still linger for far too many ordinary Americans. Congress, the elected representatives of the people, must find its moral compass, push through this unending nightmare of political gridlock and do right by the people. Contrary to the silly and obsessive partisan gamesmanship that currently paralyzes our politics, much more is at stake than the next election or some empty ideological argument. On the line are the lives of decent hardworking Americans, trying to cross over into the dignity of work but still caught in the barbwire of a historic global recession. Opinion: For women, equal pay and economic justice are civil rights issues. Some argue that unemployment benefits are a disincentive to people finding employment. But the sheer number of our unemployed neighbors and family members speaks volumes about the fallibility of such a claim. According to The Washington Post, the long-term unemployment rate has not been as high as it is now since World War II. A jaw-dropping 4 million Americans have been out of work for 27 weeks or longer. The problems we face are systemic and structural, and the vast majority of the unemployed are crippled not by a lack of interest or drive, but of opportunity and access. That's why long-term solutions for economic growth are needed. But in the meantime, we will actually do further damage to a struggling economy if our elected officials shape public policy by the very same stereotypes and faulty assumptions that keep some unemployed in the first place. For a major reason that the unemployed cannot find work is because they are unemployed. The data show that they face bias and discrimination. If anyone has the ability to provide some relief from this vicious cycle, it is Congress, and its members should feel obligated to do so. Moreover, those of us who are faith leaders, particularly we pastors in the African-American churches, should speak up too. Because black unemployment is twice that of whites and has been for as long as the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping track by race, we have an obligation to honor our historic reason for being -- defending those on the margins of the margins. Lessons with MLK: Eight students recall a special class. As we celebrate the life of the most famous black pastor, Martin Luther King Jr., we should remember that the black church mission connects faith with justice and personal salvation with social transformation, and addresses personal piety and public policy for the well-being of the whole person and the whole community. It fights for the weak and sees the Gospel as \\"good news to the poor.\\" More than 50 years after Dr. King and others marched on Washington for jobs and freedom, African-Americans remain disproportionately unemployed and impoverished. The unemployment rate for African-Americans was at 12.5% when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the most recent numbers last month. Yet the fact is the black unemployment rate will undoubtedly increase if extended unemployment insurance is cut off now, adding to the devastating impact that rampant unemployment has already had on the black community for decades. And given our nation's shifting demographics, that's bad for everybody. The greatest MLK speeches you never heard. Playing politics with the very unemployment insurance afforded to American workers who are now unemployed is both immoral and economically destructive. That's why now, more than ever, we need to hear the voices of people of faith and people of good will raising the moral and practical questions about who we are to one another. And the black church -- that American church built by those who worked without wages or benefits, born fighting for freedom and thus the source of America's greatest freedom fighter -- ought to lead the way. If we really want to honor Dr. King and protect the American promise, we must demand that Congress do the right thing for American workers and the right thing for the American economy. Do not shrink a struggling economy, putting us all at risk. Rather, extend the safety net of unemployment insurance to those who cannot help but stimulate the economy by spending it immediately on the basics of food, gas and medicine, even as we debate the best prescription for long term economic health. It's just the right thing to do. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Raphael G. Warnock. Highlights:","completion":"1.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. When will fresh skin cells ready for treatment occur when cleansing skin? - not enough information - after using water - after using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser - after using soap A:","completion":"After using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Gaelic system was disrupted by the English peerage in the early modern period by confiscations deemed illegal in Continental courts at the time. The latter system consists of those titles of nobility created by the English monarchs in their capacity as Lord or King of Ireland, or later by monarchs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The English ranks of the Irish peerage are Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount and Baron, whilst the Irish system uses Gaelic titles, in accordance with a genealogy of the Ard Rí (High King of Ireland) chronicled in numerous ancient manuscripts, including the Annals of the Four Masters. The Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland continues to exercise jurisdiction over its Peerage of Ireland, but not those peers whose titles derive from places located in what is now the Republic of Ireland. Importantly, Article 40.2 of the Irish Constitution forbids conference of titles of nobility by anyone but the Uatarán -- President of the Republic -- and a citizen may not accept titles of nobility or honour except with the prior approval of the Government. Gaelic titles of nobility, amongst the oldest in European history, remain the providence of individual clanna or families.

Shortly thereafter, Annie tells the family that she's pregnant, and George begins to mildly panic, insisting he is too young to be a grandfather. He has his assistant make a list of people who are older than him, dyes his hair brown, and decides he and Nina should sell the home their children have grown up in if one more thing goes wrong with it. Termites strike the house two weeks later. George puts the house on the market without telling Nina, and sells it to the Habibs. At dinner, after a discussion on whether the baby's last name will be hyphenated or not, George reveals the house has been sold. Nina is livid, as she and George have to be out in 10 days and have no place to go. Having no place to go, the Banks stay at the mansion owned by Bryan's parents. As the MacKenzies are on a cruise in the Caribbean, the Banks have to deal with their vicious Dobermans, much to the chagrin of George, who is still obviously paranoid from a previous mishap with them. Nina begins experiencing symptoms that bring up the concern of menopause. After visiting the doctor the following day, they are given the opposite news: Nina is pregnant, too. Not long after, they have a chance meeting with Franck, Annie's wedding planner, who is elated at both women expecting. George switches gears, now believing he is too old to be a father again. His feelings come to a head when he and Nina go to Annie's and Bryan's house to announce their news. Nina brings his insensitivity to light and tells him not to come home.

However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns.

We want to take care of the environment, we don't want to pollute the air and we don't want to waste energy and resources. But we also want to be fashionable. How can we buy fashionable clothes and protect the environment? Old styles are fashionable again, so one way is to buy second-hand clothes -- recycled clothes. Another way is to buy' fair trade clothes. These clothes are either recycled or made in a ' way that protects the environment. They also protect the people who make the clothes. Surprisingly, white cotton is one of the least environmentally-friendly crops of all. To protect the cotton, the growers use chemicals that pollute water, make farm workers ill and kill wildlife. New materials, such as hemp and bamboo, grow quickly and are more environmentally-friendly. These materials are very soft, and look fantastic. The best materials are coloured using natural dyes, made from plants. Environmentally-friendly clothes are practical but until now they were often dull.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 11 = 4*r - 9 for r.","completion":"To solve the given equation 11 = 4*r - 9 for the variable r, we follow the steps below: Step 1: Isolate the term containing the variable r. In this case, the term containing the variable r is 4*r. To isolate it, we should first get rid of the constant term on the right-hand side of the equation, which is -9. Step 2: Add 9 to both sides of the equation. Since we want to remove the constant term -9, we perform the inverse operation, which is addition. 11 = 4*r - 9 11 + 9 = 4*r - 9 + 9 This simplifies to: 20 = 4*r Step 3: Now that we have the term containing the variable r isolated, we move to solving for r by undoing the multiplication operation by 4. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 4. 20 = 4*r 20 / 4 = 4*r / 4 Step 4: Simplify the equation. 5 = r So, the solution for the given equation is r = 5."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Which place did Holmes allow himself to be captured by Spedding and her gang?

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Available options: [-] no; [-] yes;","completion":"Converting Kilometers to Megameters: There are several ways to convert kilometers to megameters, and the process is relatively straightforward as it involves simple mathematical operations. Before diving into the methods of conversion, let's understand the relationship between these two units of length. 1 kilometer (km) is equal to 0.001 megameters (Mm). In other words, one megameter is equal to 1,000 kilometers. Keeping this relationship in mind, we can explore different ways to convert kilometers to megameters: 1. Division Method Divide the given kilometers by 1,000 to obtain the length in megameters. For example, if you have 5000 kilometers, you would divide 5000 by 1000 to get 5 megameters (5000 km / 1000 = 5 Mm). 2. Multiplication with Conversion Factor Method Multiply the given kilometers by the conversion factor from kilometers to megameters (0.001). For example, if you have 2,000 kilometers, you would multiply 2000 by 0.001 to get 2 megameters (2000 km * 0.001 = 2 Mm). 3. Unit Cancelling Method Another approach is to use a unit conversion chart and cancel out the units for easier calculations. For example, if you have 3,500 kilometers, the conversion would look like this: 3500 km * (1 Mm / 1000 km) = 3500/1000 Mm = 3.5 Mm Here, the kilometer unit cancels out, leaving you with the value in megameters. Converting Miles to Kilometers: 1 mile is approximately equal to 1.60934 kilometers. To convert miles to kilometers, you can use a similar approach as with the kilometers to megameters conversion: 1. Multiplication with Conversion Factor Method Multiply the given miles by the conversion factor from miles to kilometers (1.60934). For example, if you have 10 miles, you would multiply 10 by 1.60934 to get approximately 16.0934 kilometers (10 miles * 1.60934 = 16.0934 km). 2. Proportional Calculation Method You can also set up a proportion and solve for the unknown value. If 'x' is the distance in kilometers, and 'm' is the distance in miles, the proportion can be expressed as: x km / 1.60934 = m miles For example, to convert 15 miles into kilometers, set up the proportion like this: x km / 1.60934 = 15 miles Then, cross-multiply and solve for x: x = 15 * 1.60934 x ≈ 24.1401 km Multi-choice problem: Regarding the multi-choice problem, the correct answer is: - no This is because the two questions inquire about different information. The first question is about converting kilometers to megameters, while the second question is about converting miles to kilometers.

Film Has Some Merit Despite Some Flaws . I enjoyed this film very much. It strikes a common chord for a lot of gay people who have suffered rejection and pain for their coming out of the closet. How many can identify with the lead character David, obviously suffering from the depression of an unrequited love for his best straight friend of fourteen years, a fellow named Theo. What gives this film merit is that they made the gay character straight acting, devoid of all feminine stereotypes that most gay films project into their lead gay characters. In an ironic twist, his best friend, Theo, played by John Simm is decidedly feminine acting and looking yet he is the straight guy. Unfortunately, Simm and the actress who plays his girlfriend have NO chemistry, thus making their relationship implausible. If it is true that gay people look for \\"looks in a person first\\" rather than personality, then this movie proves that this is a myth. I liked the fact that David, who could have any man he wanted (because HE is the good looking one) saw beyond Theo's average looks and felt a genuine, albeit, obsessive and unhealthy love for him. One sympathizes with David because he is so obviously miserable having to stand by and watch his best friend get it on with the girlfriend, and then hear the details afterward. Again, how many gay people have ever been in this situation? It is a common occurrence in the gay community. Another implausibility is the \\"coming out on a talk show\\" with a near \\"Jenny Jones\\" type of fiasco at the end with Theo nearly beating David to a pulp until his girlfriend, who inexplicably and conveniently shows up and stops him from killing David. One can't believe that Theo would have THAT much violence and hated toward David, no matter what drove David to break up the relationship between Theo and the girlfriend. John Simm (Theo) did not play the aspect of homophobia convincingly enough to warrant his attack. The film ends with David serenely contended in a lush, green park, free at last. Free from hiding, yes, but free from his love for THeo? I think not. The film was, indeed, realistic in its attempt to portray the consequences of coming out and a homophobic society. However, the end result is that, in my opinion, one is not entirely convinced that Theo would abandon David in such a violent way. Not after being taken care of and defended by David for fourteen years. Thanks to the fine portrayal of the actor who played David, this film has merit because he made the character sympathetic and identifiable, despite some of the malicious things he was driven to do for the sake of his love for Theo. This film is worth a look.","completion":"POS"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Can you tell me the answer to who wrote the poem that is engraved on the pedestal of the statue of liberty??","completion":"The poem engraved on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty is titled \\"The New Colossus,\\" and it was written by American poet Emma Lazarus in 1883. Emma Lazarus was born on July 22, 1849, in New York City. She was part of a Sephardic Jewish family with Portuguese roots, and her father, Moses Lazarus, was a wealthy merchant. Emma was well-educated, having studied languages, literature, and poetry from a young age, allowing her to become a prolific poet throughout her life. \\"The New Colossus\\" was initially written as a contribution to an auction of art and literary works organized by the \\"Art Loan Fund Exhibition in Aid of the Bartholdi Pedestal Fund for the Statue of Liberty.\\" The goal of this auction was to raise money for the construction of the pedestal upon which the Statue of Liberty would stand. Although the poem did not gain much recognition at the time, it later became an essential part of the statue's symbolism and message. The poem alludes to the Colossus of Rhodes, an ancient statue that was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. However, Lazarus' poem portrays the Statue of Liberty as a new symbol of freedom and hope for the oppressed, extending a welcome to immigrants from all over the world. Some of the most famous lines of the poem read: \\"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\\" These words embody the spirit of the United States, which has long been viewed as a land of opportunity and refuge for those seeking a better life. The poem gained increased prominence in 1903 when it was engraved on a bronze plaque and mounted inside the pedestal of the statue. Emma Lazarus' powerful words continue to serve as a poignant reminder of the message of hope, freedom, and acceptance that the Statue of Liberty represents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Article: By the middle of the 19th century, newspapers were becoming the primary means of spreading and receiving information. The period between 1890 and 1920 is known as the \\"golden age\\" of print media. Broadcast radio came onto the media scene in the 1920's. Newspapers were forced to re-evaluate their role as society's primary information provider. Like the new media technologies of today, the development of a low-cost, convenient media source produced results that radio would greatly affect the newspaper industry. No sooner had newspapers adapted to radio than they were forced to re-evaluate themselves because of a new and more powerful medium: television. Between 1940 and 1990, newspaper sales in America dropped from one newspaper for every two adults to one for every three adults. Some newspapers, like USA Today, responded to the technological advancements by using color1 and the \\"short, quick and to the point\\" stories that are usually featured on television. The technological revolution of today is creating new challenges and opportunities for traditional media. Never before has so much information been so accessible to so many. By the end of the 1990s, about 700 traditional media had websites; today there are thousands. The amount and speed of information on the Internet is _ , but it has not signalled the end of the newspaper's existence . Newspapers in print remain a popular and powerful medium for the reporting and analysis of events that shape our lives. It is reported that one billion people in the world read a newspaper every day!

The article indicates that newspapers once reigned as the primary information provider and had to adapt with the emergence of new technologies like the radio and television but they still remain significant. An important piece of evidence comes from the article's statement, \\"Newspapers in print remain a popular and powerful medium for the reporting and analysis of events that shape our lives.\\" Further, it quotes an impressive statistic: \\"It is reported that one billion people in the world read a newspaper every day!\\" Given this data, the assertion that \\"newspapers still play an important part in our life\\" is supported by the information provided in the given text, hence the answer is 'Yes'."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On February 26, 2022, Miura became the first 50-year-old player to score in the Japanese league, bringing immense pride to his fans and country alike. Background (Step 2: Provide background information on the player and his journey) Born in Shizuoka, Japan, in 1967, Kazuyoshi Miura began his illustrious football career with Brazilian club Santos at the age of 15. Affectionately known as \\"King Kazu,\\" Miura has not only shattered domestic records but also held the record for the oldest professional football player to score a goal at 48 years and 59 days, prior to his recent achievement. Club history (Step 3: Discuss Miura's current club and his goals over the years) Currently playing for the second-division club Yokohama FC, Miura's age-defying capabilities have become an integral part of the team's success. With a career spanning more than three decades, King Kazu scored his 196th career goal on February 26, 2022, which secured his position as the oldest player to ever score in Japanese professional football.

Question: Article: Six days before the 63rd birthday of New China, our country received a great gift. The country's first aircraft carrier , Liaoning, has made China become the l0th country in the world to have an aircraft camer. An aircraft carrier is a kind of ship that planes can fly from and land on--like an airport on the sea. It stands for a country's military strength . It plays an important role in modern wars. In August last year, the air craft carrier began its trial run at Dalian Port in Liaoning. The carrier was at first called the Varyag. It was built in the former Soviet Union. However, the Soviets failed to finish the ship. China bought the Varyag in 1998. Now after 10 trial runs, the aircraft carrier, renamed Liaoning, is in active service. Liaoning is about 300 meters long and 70 meters wide. It can take 30 planes and hold 2,000 soldiers. According to Xinhua News, Liaoning will be used for scientific research and military training. The aircraft carrier will help protect our country and promote world peace. The BBC said that Liaoning coming into service \\" marks China as a rising power\\". ,. Question: When was China's aircraft carrier born? Yes or no, is the answer \\"September 25th.\\"? Answer:","completion":"To find out when China's aircraft carrier was born, we need to analyze the information given in the article. The article states that it was six days before the 63rd birthday of New China when the country received the aircraft carrier as a great gift. We know that the People's Republic of China was founded on October 1, 1949. Step 1: Determine the date of the 63rd birthday of New China. 1949 + 63 = 2012 So, the 63rd birthday of New China was on October 1, 2012. Step 2: Calculate six days before the 63rd birthday of New China. October 1, 2012, minus 6 days equals September 25, 2012. Therefore, China's aircraft carrier was born on September 25, 2012, and the answer \\"September 25th\\" is correct.

It is possible that the sister grows daffodils, which are a popular type of flower. However, it is important to note that daffodils are typically not considered to be a popular choice for drying or creating dried flower arrangements. Rather, the more commonly dried flowers include varieties such as roses, lavender, and hydrangeas. Therefore, while it is certainly possible that the sister also grows daffodils, the first sentence alone does not give us enough information to confirm the second sentence as true.

Review: The com.google.android.gms app has become an integral part of my daily life. With its wide array of handy features and seamless integration with Google services, it truly improves my overall experience with using Android. First off, the app's core functionality is excellent – it provides stable and consistent updates for Google Play Services. The background tasks run smoothly, and the periodic updates are efficient. All these ensure that my apps stay connected, synchronized, and up-to-date, giving me peace of mind. Additionally, the app has some impressive built-in libraries. The Google Maps API never disappoints, offering precise and accessible location information. Similarly, the Firebase integration provides valuable tools for app development and enhancement. However, my main concern is the power consumption. I noticed a significant drain on the battery after prolonged periods of usage. This can be quite challenging when away from a charging source, and I hope future updates address this issue. Another area I believe could use refinement is the app's user interface. While minimalistic and functional, it would be even more appealing if it were more user-friendly and visually engaging, especially for less tech-savvy users. All things considered, I give com.google.android.gms a rating of 4 stars out of 5.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the band that played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All? ? Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity....

Nevertheless Lurz has hatched a secret plan to boost sales. Meanwhile Susanne, Lurzâs secretary, receives a phone call with the message: The world as will and idea.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Whose album changed perceived notions about the number of successful singles that could be taken from one album? Blender described Jackson as the \\"late 20th century's preeminent pop icon\\", while The New York Times gave the opinion that he was a \\"musical phenomenon\\" and that \\"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else\\". Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately 2 (US4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of 12 (US29 in 2018 dollars). Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, \\"At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple\\".At the time of the album's release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&M Records, read that, \\"The whole industry has a stake in this success\\". Time magazine speculated that \\"the fallout from Thriller has given the [music] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of 4.1 billion\\". Time summed up Thriller's impact as a \\"restoration of confidence\\" for an industry bordering on \\"the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop\\". The publication described Jackson's influence at that point as, \\"Star of records, radio,... Answer:","completion":"Michael Jackson's album \\"Thriller\\" changed the perceived notions about the number of successful singles that could be taken from one album.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? A). yes B). it is not possible to tell C). no","completion":"C). No To provide a detailed explanation, let's go through the given sentences and their meanings. Sentence 1: \\"Be inventive.\\" - This sentence suggests that the subject should be creative and come up with new ideas, concepts, or objects. It implies a sense of encouragement or instruction to foster innovation and original thinking. Sentence 2: \\"Stop trying to make stuff.\\" - This sentence conveys the opposite sentiment of the first sentence. It implies that the subject should cease their attempts at creating or coming up with new things. It shows discouragement or restraint towards the creative process. Now, let's analyze the relationship between these two sentences. The question asks: \\"If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?\\" Considering the meanings of both sentences, it becomes clear that the first sentence, \\"Be inventive,\\" encourages creativity and innovation, while the second sentence, \\"Stop trying to make stuff,\\" discourages the same creative process. As a result, the two sentences present contradictory statements. Thus, if the first sentence is true, which encourages creativity, then the second sentence cannot be true because it discourages creative efforts. The two sentences contradict each other, so it is impossible for both statements to be true simultaneously. Therefore, the correct answer is C).

Original sentence information: 1. A black man. 2. In a dress shirt. 3. Is looking through a microscope. 4. A poster about blood cells. 5. Poster is on the wall in the background. Condensed sentence information: 1. A man. 2. Uses a microscope. 3. A poster hanging behind him. Step 1: Compare the subjects of the sentences. The original sentence describes \\"a black man\\" while the condensed sentence only says \\"a man.\\" These two descriptions are compatible since both refer to a man. So, the first part of the condensed sentence is correct. Step 2: Compare the actions of the sentences. The original sentence says the man \\"is looking through a microscope,\\" and the condensed sentence says \\"uses a microscope.\\" These two actions are essentially the same. Therefore, the second part of the condensed sentence is also correct. Step 3: Compare the contextual information of the sentences. The original sentence mentions \\"a poster about blood cells\\" and says that it \\"is on the wall in the background.\\" The condensed sentence says \\"a poster hanging behind him.\\" While they do not specifically mention that it is about blood cells in the condensed sentence, it is still true that there is a poster hanging in the background. So, the third part of the condensed sentence is correct as well.

Alibaba Group Holding, which last week filed for an initial public offering in the U.S., has been making some other interesting applications. Early last month, the Chinese e-commerce giant registered a company in Hong Kong under the name Alibaba Films Group. Later in the month, it changed the name to the more slick-sounding Alibaba Pictures Group. What this mysterious company will do isn’t clear, though hints abound. The two directors of Alibaba Pictures Group listed in the registry documents — Dong Ping and Zhao Chao — are both executives at ChinaVision Media, a television and film-production company in which Alibaba bought a 60% stake in March for 805 million. At the time, Alibaba didn’t elaborate on its plans, only saying it would team up with ChinaVision to “explore future business opportunities as part of Alibaba’s digital entertainment strategy.” ChinaVision last year was one of the distributors of the action-comedy movie “Journey to the West: Conquering the Demon,” directed by Hong Kong movie star Stephen Chow. The company’s TV series last year included the drama “Left Hand Joins Right Hand.” Dong, ChinaVision’s chairman, co-produced the 2000 international hit “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” which won an Oscar for best foreign-language film. He has also been involved in several other internationally distributed Chinese movies. Dong also co-founded the popular tabloid Beijing Times in cooperation with the People’s Daily, the official mouthpiece of China’s Communist Party. So, is Alibaba going into the movies? An Alibaba spokeswoman declined to comment on the registration, while a ChinaVision representative in Hong Kong couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. But since the beginning of this year, Alibaba has been trying to expand into entertainment and digital-media industries through aggressive acquisitions and newly developed services, as part of its attempt to make its e-commerce and other platforms more attractive. In January, for example, Alibaba started offering videogames to people using its e-commerce mobile apps. Last month, Alibaba agreed to buy a 16.5% stake in Youku Tudou, a Chinese online video company that works like a combination of YouTube and Netflix. A private-equity fund set up by Alibaba founder Jack Ma also agreed to buy a 2% stake in Youku Tudou, bringing the total value of that deal to 1.22 billion. ______________________________________________________ For the latest news and analysis, follow us @WSJD.

Soon afterwards the Second World War breaks out and Celia's father joins what was to become the Home Guard and her more confident sister Phyllis joins the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Fearing her father's disapproval if she moves away from home, Celia hesitates about joining up but eventually her call-up papers arrive. Hoping to join the WAAF or one of the other services, Celia instead gets posted to a factory making aircraft components, where she meets her co-workers, including her Welsh room-mate Gwen Price and the vain upper middle class Jennifer Knowles. Knowles dislikes the work they have to do at the factory, causing friction with their supervisor Charlie Forbes which eventually blossoms into a verbally combative romance. A nearby RAF bomber station sends some of its men to a staff dance at the factory, during which Celia meets and falls in love with an equally shy young Scottish flight sergeant Fred Blake.

A YEAR AFTER KOREAN UPRISING, CHUN'S GRIP IS FIRM SEOUL, South Korea, May 26— A year after the civil insurrection in Kwangju and despite recent minor demonstrations, President Chun Doo Hwan appears to have consolidated his grip on power, according to Western diplomats. As a result, the diplomats said, South Korea and its 38 million people should enjoy a period of comparative calm and stability. Government officials said that Mr. Chun and his supporters have begun capitalizing on this and devoting their efforts mainly to the country's economic performance. ''The only sector they have to worry about now is the economy,'' a Western diplomat said, adding that political opponents, religious dissidents and student militants ''are having trouble getting people to do much.'' They would ''need a Kent State-type situation'' in order to stimulate activity, he said, referring to the 1970 incident in which Ohio National Guardsmen killed four persons at an antiwar protest at Kent State University. Several Days of Riots South Korea's version of Kent State occurred on a much more violent scale a year ago, in several days of anti-Government demonstrations in Kwangju, 160 miles south of Seoul. By official count, at least 189 people were killed and thousands were injured when troops were ordered by Mr. Chun, then a general, to move into the city and restore order. The ferocity of the Government's reaction to that protest, combined with other measures in the last year aimed at repressing popular opposition to Mr. Chun, left dissident groups divided and weak. ''The human rights movement here has adopted a wait-and-see attitude,'' a diplomat said. ''They ask why they should go out and get their heads bashed in.'' The campuses, historically a source of dissent, have been relatively placid in recent months, students and professors said. ''It is not from happiness or satisfaction,'' a professor explained, ''but fear and resignation.'' Minor Protests on Campuses Last week there were demonstrations at several universities, but both witnesses and the police described them as minor. About 400 students distributed anti-Government leaflets or marched at Sung Kyun Kwan University, a Buddhist institution in Seoul, and about 20 of them were detained by the police, an instructor said. Other demonstrations in the capital, at Seoul National University and Korea University, drew similar turnouts and police reaction, witnesses said. Park Shin Il, a Government spokesman, said the regime was trying to overlook the demonstrations ''as much as possible'' while preventing the protesting students from going out into the streets. ''Unless we grow out of this chronic phenomenon,'' he said, ''we won't make it as a mature, stable society.'' In Kwangju, 20 to 30 Roman Catholic priests began a hunger strike last week, according to diplomatic and church sources, and demanded the release from prison of Kim Dae Jung, South Korea's most prominent dissident, who was convicted of sedition last year but whose death sentence was commuted by President Chun in January. Call for Priest's Release The priests reportedly also demanded compensation for the victims of the Kwangju rioting and the release of a priest jailed last year for alleged involvement in the uprising. It was not clear whether the priests had ended their hunger strike. Citing police reports, Mr. Park, the Government spokesman, said that the men ''voluntarily'' ended the strike on Thursday, but that claim could not be independently confirmed. The Government has not responded officially to any of the priests' demands. The Government of Mr. Chun faces a huge challenge in its effort to deal with the nation's formidable economic problems. After a decade in which the real gross national product grew by an average of nearly 10 percent a year, it declined 5.7 percent last year. Economists and business leaders attributed most of the drop to the 44 percent inflation rate and the consequent loss of price competitiveness in world export markets. To regain their edge, economists say, South Korean companies must curb wage increases, which averaged more than 30 percent in each of the last three years. However, because of a decline in real income for many workers last year, the Government must control inflation to prevent political unrest, especially at the lower end of the salary scale. ''Someday there will be an incident at some factory and nobody knows where it will go,'' a diplomat said. Hesitation on New Investment Recent indicators portend a gradual strengthening of the economy, Korean and foreign economists said, but both Korean and foreign business leaders remain hesitant about resuming or initiating substantial investments or purchase orders. The new National Assembly finished its first session last week after debating and passing largely inconsequential legislation. Many Koreans question whether that body can ever become a center of influence in view of President Chun's authoritarian control. Oh Se Eung, an 11-year veteran of the legislature and a member of Mr. Chun's party, said he believed the Assembly would eventually become something more than a rubber stamp for Mr. Chun. ''There is no reason that he would not want the National Assembly to take care of political affairs so pressure for change would not spill over to university campuses,'' Mr. Oh said. Meanwhile, both supporters and opponents of Mr. Chun agreed that after 19 months of turmoil following the assassination of President Park Chung Hee in October 1979, most South Koreans were ready for the stability, authoritarian or not, that Mr. Chun seems to offer. ''They've changed the rusty old Park barbed wire for shiny new barbed wire,'' a diplomat said, ''but it's still barbed wire.''

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs.

In the South Seas, a volcano explodes, eventually causing North Pole icebergs to shift. Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis. He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop. Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis. Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men.

Even if you are against a person, it is important to have respect. It is this respect that makes us human. Without respect, we become animals. We need to respect our friends for our friendship. We even need to respect our enemies because they help us to grow up and become stronger. Respect is one of the crucial values in a relationship. Love Love is everything. With love in our hearts, we feel no need to hurt another. With love in our hearts, we will pay more attention to the similarities in opinions rather than the disagreement. If we want others to be good to us, we need to be good to them. After all, we give love to get love, right? Loyalty People often ignore the meaning and importance of loyalty. Loyalty is necessary for people to believe in each other. In no matter what kind of friendship, we need to believe in each other so that we can work together towards the same goal.

If Reminders of the permanent threat posed by pirates can be found everywhere on Ibiza., can we conclude that \\"Pirates weren't a serious threat.\\"? Available options: A). yes; B). it is not possible to tell; C). no;","completion":"C). no Based on the statement provided, \\"Reminders of the permanent threat posed by pirates can be found everywhere on Ibiza,\\" we can conclude that pirates were indeed a serious threat, at least in the context of Ibiza. The fact that there are numerous reminders of the threat suggests that pirates had a significant impact on the island and its people. Historically, piracy was a significant issue for many coastal areas, as seafaring pirates would often raid and plunder towns, take hostages, and create a sense of fear among the local population. Ibiza, being an island in the Mediterranean Sea, would have been particularly exposed to the maritime activities of pirates due to its geographical location. Moreover, the presence of visible reminders of the pirate threat on Ibiza suggests that their impact on the island must have been on a scale that warranted commemoration or remembrance. These reminders could include fortifications built to defend against pirate attacks, historical artifacts that reflect piracy's role in the local economy, or even cultural influences manifested through local storytelling, music, and events celebrating or remembering the battle against piracy. However, it is important to note that this conclusion primarily focuses on Ibiza and its experiences with piracy. In different parts of the world or at different points in history, the pirate threat may have indeed been less significant. Therefore, while we can conclude that \\"pirates weren't a serious threat\\" is not an accurate statement for Ibiza, it may be true in other locations and contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer choices: - It reaches the dew point - heat to cooler objects - whale movement - it flows to a lower level - Earth's axis of rotation is tilted - vanes on submarins - Martian winds rotating. - 180 revolutions per minute. A:","completion":"The vanes rotating in an object with 180 revolutions per minute cause air to move due to the principle of fluid dynamics and the generation of a pressure difference around the vanes. When the vanes rotate at such a high speed, they effectively create a pressure difference between the front and the back of the vane. The air in front of the vane is compressed, generating high pressure, while the air behind the vane experiences a low-pressure zone. This difference in pressure results in the air molecules in the high-pressure zone moving towards the low-pressure zone, causing air to move. To summarize, the vanes rotating at 180 revolutions per minute cause air to move due to the pressure differences generated by the motion, and not any of the other options. However, it's important to note that some of these options can impact the movement of air in different scenarios: - The dew point can affect humidity levels and condensation in the surrounding air. - Heat transfer to cooler objects can cause air to expand or contract, affecting air movement. - Whale movement and vanes on submarines can influence water flow, not air movement. - Earth's axis of rotation and tilt can affect global weather patterns, indirectly affecting air movement. - Martian winds and rotational forces can cause air to move, but only in the context of the planet Mars"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Washington state, which had many wildfires year-round, and Oregon, state which had almost no wildfires. Ben enjoyed the visit and planned to return. Which state had more people inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke? Hint: Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer. Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream... Answer:","completion":"Washington state had more people inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke since it experienced many wildfires year-round, whereas Oregon had almost no wildfires. As mentioned in the hint, wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides, and other compounds. The main health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide. Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. The impact of PM on the human body varies based on the size of the particles: coarse PM can cause respiratory inflammation and eye or sinus irritation, while smaller PM can move further into the respiratory system, leading to more severe complications, especially for individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma. Washington state, having experienced more wildfires, would have subjected its residents to increased exposure to wildfire smoke and its harmful components, including carbon dioxide. This exposure may lead to various health problems for the residents, specifically those related to the respiratory system. In contrast, Oregon had fewer instances of wildfires and thus, lower exposure to harmful smoke and its components for its population. It is essential to relay evidence about the health effects of wildfire smoke to the public and influence policy changes to promote positive health outcomes and limit exposure in regions where wildfires are prevalent, such as Washington state."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The earliest known mechanical mill is the Hierapolis sawmill, a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis, Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD. Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and in the next few centuries, spread across Europe. The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade. Generally, only the saw was powered, and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand. An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage, also water powered, to move the log steadily through the saw blade. - A hammer is a tool or device that delivers a blow (a sudden impact) to an object. Most hammers are hand tools used to drive nails, fit parts, forge metal, and break apart objects. Hammers vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes. - Flour is a powder made by grinding raw grains or roots and used to make many different foods. Cereal flour is the main ingredient of bread, which is a staple food for many cultures, making the availability of adequate supplies of flour a major economic and political issue at various times throughout history. Wheat flour is one of the most important ingredients in Oceanic, European, South American, North American, Middle Eastern, North Indian and North African cultures, and is the defining ingredient in their styles of breads and pastries. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - Bristol is a city, unitary authority area and county in South West England with an estimated population of 449,300 in 2016. It is England's sixth and the United Kingdom's eighth most populous city, and the most populous city in Southern England after London. The city borders the Unitary Authority areas of North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, with the historic cities of Bath and Gloucester to the south-east and north-east, respectively. - Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south. It is part of South West England, bounded by Cornwall to the west, Somerset to the northeast, and Dorset to the east. The City of Exeter is the county town; seven other districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge, and West Devon are under the jurisdiction of Devon County Council; Plymouth and Torbay are each a part of Devon but administered as unitary authorities. Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is and its population is about 1.1 million. - South West England is one of nine official regions of England. It is the largest in area, covering and the counties of Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall, as well as the Isles of Scilly. Five million people live in South West England. - A metal (from Greek \\"métallon\\", \\"mine, quarry, metal\\") is a material (an element, compound, or alloy) that is typically hard, opaque, shiny, and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. Metals are generally malleable that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire). About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals, the others are nonmetals or metalloids. Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms. - A paper mill is a factory devoted to making paper from vegetable fibres such as wood pulp, old rags and other ingredients using a Fourdrinier machine or other type of paper machine. - The Severn Estuary is the estuary of the River Severn, the longest river in Great Britain. It is at the mouth of four major rivers, being the Severn, Wye, Usk and Avon, and other smaller rivers. Its high tidal range of about means that it has been at the centre of discussions in the UK regarding renewable energy. - The River Avill is a small river on Exmoor in Somerset, England. - A water turbine is a rotary machine that converts kinetic energy and potential energy of water into mechanical work. - Wiltshire (or ) is a county in South West England with an area of . It is landlocked and borders the counties of Dorset, Somerset, Hampshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire. The county town was Wilton but Wiltshire Council is now based in the new county town of Trowbridge. - The Bristol Channel is a major inlet in the island of Great Britain, separating South Wales from Devon and Somerset in South West England. It extends from the lower estuary of the River Severn to the North Atlantic Ocean. It takes its name from the English city of Bristol, and is over 30 miles (50 km) across at its widest point. - A water wheel is a machine for converting the energy of free-flowing or falling water into useful forms of power, often in a watermill. A water wheel consists of a large wooden or metal wheel, with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface. Most commonly, the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle, but the tub or Norse wheel is mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft. Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears; horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load. - A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses moving water as its power source. It is thus a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding), rolling, or hammering. Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods, including flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and many metal products. Thus watermills may be gristmills, sawmills, paper mills, textile mills, hammermills, trip hammering mills, rolling mills, wire drawing mills, and so on. - Lumber (American English; used only in North America), or timber (used in the rest of the English speaking world) is wood that has been processed into beams and planks, a stage in the process of wood production. Lumber may also refer to currently un-needed furniture, as in Lumber room, or an awkward gait, ultimately derived from the look of unfashionable and unwanted furniture. - A wheel is a circular component that is intended to rotate on an axle bearing. The wheel is one of the main components of the wheel and axle which is one of the six simple machines. Wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines. Wheels are also used for other purposes, such as a ship's wheel, steering wheel, potter's wheel and flywheel. - Wire drawing is a metalworking process used to reduce the cross-section of a wire by pulling the wire through a single, or series of, drawing die(s). There are many applications for wire drawing, including electrical wiring, cables, tension-loaded structural components, springs, paper clips, spokes for wheels, and stringed musical instruments. Although similar in process, drawing is different from extrusion, because in drawing the wire is pulled, rather than pushed, through the die. Drawing is usually performed at room temperature, thus classified as a cold working process, but it may be performed at elevated temperatures for large wires to reduce forces. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - Paper is a thin material produced by pressing together moist fibres of cellulose pulp derived from wood, rags or grasses, and drying them into flexible sheets. It is a versatile material with many uses, including writing, printing, packaging, cleaning, and a number of industrial and construction processes.

(Lo Sai Hung/AP) Like a shot of adrenalin, Hong Kong quickens the pulse. Skyscrapers march up jungle-clad slopes by day and blaze neon by night, across a harbour criss-crossed by freighters and motor junks. Hong Kong can overwhelm but offers fantastic experiences, especially to visitors who are willing to step out of their comfort zone. See The Peak Tram rises above skyscrapers, departing from the lower terminus and climbing to the 552-metre Victoria Peak. On clear days and at night, the view from the top is amazing (7am-midnight, every 15 minutes; £3). The largest of Hong Kong’s Man Mo temples was the hub of civil life on the island in the 19th century. The Taoist temple was built in 1847 by Chinese merchants and was dedicated to the gods of literature, ‘man’, and of war, ‘mo’ (24-126 Hollywood Rd, Sheung Wan; 8am-6pm; free). Hong Kong’s first heritage trail, the Ping Shan, includes the territory’s oldest pagoda, a magnificent ancestral hall and temples. All were built by the Tang clan, the most powerful of the five clans that settled in the New Territories around the 11th century (West Rail Tin Shui Wai station, exit E; 10am-1pm and 2pm-5pm; free). Temple Street Night Market is Hong Kong’s liveliest. Aside from the clothes, watches and footwear on offer, it’s worth a visit for the smells and tastes of the open-air street stall and for the occasional Cantonese opera shows. Night owls should try the fruit market, open from midnight until dawn (Man Ming Lane; 6pm-midnight). Picturesque Tai O, on Lantau island, is one of the oldest fishing villages. It is famous for its stilt houses, rope-tow ferry and temple dedicated to the god of war, Guan Yu. Reach it by bus 1 from the Mui Wo ferry point. Eat and drink Dah Wing Wah is the place to go for the village cuisine of the northern New Territories. Local ingredients are sourced from small farms and food producers. Try the lemon-steamed mullet and smoked oysters (00 852 2476 9888; 2nd fl, Koon Wong Mansion, 2-6 On Ning Rd, Yuen Long; lunch and dinner; mains from £3). Tung Po Seafood Restaurant has revolutionised hawkerstyle cooking. Its novel menu has featured items such as steamed glutinous rice with duck jus. Beer is served in big rice bowls, to be downed bandit style. Book ahead or go before 7pm (00 852 2880 9399; 2nd fl, Municipal Services Bldg, 99 Java Rd, North Point; lunch and dinner; meals from £6). Famous tea house Luk Yu is known for its dim sum (available from 7am-5pm) and Cantonese dishes. The delectable food and elegant furnishings make up for the cavalier service (00 852 2523 5464; 24-26 Stanley St, Central; lunch and dinner; mains from £8). Ye Shanghai means ‘Shanghai nights’ and its interior is romantic. The Shanghainese food, lighter than traditional Cantonese dishes, is Michelin-starred (00 852 2376 3322; 6th fl, Marco Polo Hotel, Harbour City, Kowloon; lunch and dinner; mains from £12). The atmosphere at T’ang Court is plush, the service impeccable and the food divine. Try sautéed prawns with deep-fried taro puffs (00 852 2375 1133; Langham Hotel, 8 Peking Rd, Tsim Sha Tsui; lunch and dinner; mains from £30). Sleep Hop Inn has a youthful vibe and nine small but artful rooms, each featuring illustrations by a Hong Kong artist.

Delvin Williams emerged as an elite back, gaining over 1,200 yards rushing and made the Pro Bowl. Wilbur Jackson also enjoyed a resurgence, rushing for 792 yards. Once again Gene Washington was the teams leading receiver with 457 yards receiving and six scores. The 49ers started the season 6–1 for their best start since 1970. Most of the wins were against second-tier teams, although the 49ers did shut out the Rams 16–0, in 1976 Los Angeles Rams season on Monday Night Football. In that game the 49ers recorded 10 sacks, including 6 by Tommy Hart.

Barack Obama cautioned supporters Thursday against becoming complacent during the final days leading up to the election, noting he lost the New Hampshire primary despite a lead in the polls. After debating Sen. John McCain, Sen. Barack Obama says there's still plenty of campaigning to be done. \\"For those of you who are feeling giddy or cocky and think this is all set, I just [have] two words for you: New Hampshire,\\" the Democratic presidential nominee said during a fundraiser breakfast in New York. \\"You know I've been in these positions before where we were favored and the press starts getting carried away and we end up getting spanked. And so that's another good lesson that Hillary Clinton taught me.\\" About 10 hours after debating Sen. John McCain, Obama urged top campaign contributors at the Metropolitan Club in Manhattan to not be overconfident, despite leading in a number of national polls. A CNN Poll of Polls calculated Wednesday showed him leading 51 percent to 42 percent. \\"We've got 19 days,\\" Obama said. \\"We're going to have to work absolutely as hard as we've ever worked in our lives in order to just to get to the start of what is going to be a very difficult and very challenging but ultimately a very fulfilling four years where we can get this country back on track.\\" Watch more of Obama's comments ».

Given the question: What is the last name of the person who studied under Ambroise Thomas? Answer the above question based on the context below: Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet (French: [ʒyl emil fʁedeʁik masnɛ]; 12 May 1842 – 13 August 1912) was a French composer of the Romantic era best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty. The two most frequently staged are Manon (1884) and Werther (1892). He also composed oratorios, ballets, orchestral works, incidental music, piano pieces, songs and other music. While still a schoolboy, Massenet was admitted to France's principal music college, the Paris Conservatoire. There he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired. After winning the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1863, he composed prolifically in many genres, but quickly became best known for his operas. Between 1867 and his death forty-five years later he wrote more than forty stage works in a wide variety of styles, from opéra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths, romantic comedies, lyric dramas, as well as oratorios, cantatas and ballets. Massenet had a good sense of the theatre and of what would succeed with the Parisian public. Despite some miscalculations, he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Like many prominent French composers of the period, Massenet became a professor at the Conservatoire. He taught composition there from 1878 until 1896, when he resigned after the death of the director, Ambroise Thomas. Among his students were Gustave Charpentier, Ernest Chausson, Reynaldo Hahn and Gabriel Pierné. By the time of his death, Massenet was regarded by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted... The answer is:","completion":"Massenet. Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet is the person who studied under Ambroise Thomas. He was a French composer of the Romantic era, best known for his operas.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Why it's time for brain science to ditch the 'Venus and Mars' cliche As hardy perennials go, there is little to beat that science hacks' favourite: the hard-wiring of male and female brains. For more than 30 years, I have seen a stream of tales about gender differences in brain structure under headlines that assure me that from birth men are innately more rational and better at map-reading than women, who are emotional, empathetic multi-taskers, useless at telling jokes. I am from Mars, apparently, while the ladies in my life are from Venus. And there are no signs that this flow is drying up, with last week witnessing publication of a particularly lurid example of the genre. Writing in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia revealed they had used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging to show that the neurons in men's brains are connected to each other in a very different way from neurons in women's brains. This point was even illustrated by the team, led by Professor Ragini Verma, with a helpful diagram. A male brain was depicted with its main connections – coloured blue, needless to say – running from the front to the back. Connections within cranial hemispheres were strong, but connections between the two hemispheres were weak. By contrast, the female brain had thick connections running from side to side with strong links between the two hemispheres. \\"These maps show us a stark difference in the architecture of the human brain that helps provide a potential neural basis as to why men excel at certain tasks and women at others,\\" said Verma. The response of the press was predictable. Once again scientists had \\"proved\\" that from birth men have brains which are hardwired to give us better spatial skills, to leave us bereft of empathy for others, and to make us run, like mascara, at the first hint of emotion. Equally, the team had provided an explanation for the \\"fact\\" that women cannot use corkscrews or park cars but can remember names and faces better than males. It is all written in our neurons at birth. As I have said, I have read this sort of thing before. I didn't believe it then and I don't believe it now. It is biological determinism at its silly, trivial worst. Yes, men and women probably do have differently wired brains, but there is little convincing evidence to suggest these variations are caused by anything other than cultural factors. Males develop improved spatial skills not because of an innate superiority but because they are expected and encouraged to be strong at sport, which requires expertise at catching and throwing. Similarly, it is anticipated that girls will be more emotional and talkative, and so their verbal skills are emphasised by teachers and parents. As the years pass, these different lifestyles produce variations in brain wiring – which is a lot more plastic than most biological determinists realise. This possibility was simply not addressed by Verma and her team. Equally, when gender differences are uncovered by researchers they are frequently found to be trivial, a point made by Robert Plomin, a professor of behavioural genetics at London's Institute of Psychiatry, whose studies have found that a mere 3% of the variation in young children's verbal development is due to their gender. \\"If you map the distribution of scores for verbal skills of boys and of girls, you get two graphs that overlap so much you would need a very fine pencil indeed to show the difference between them. Yet people ignore this huge similarity between boys and girls and instead exaggerate wildly the tiny difference between them. It drives me wild.\\" I should make it clear that Plomin made that remark three years ago when I last wrote about the issue of gender and brain wiring. It was not my first incursion, I should stress. Indeed, I have returned to the subject – which is an intriguing, important one – on a number of occasions over the years as neurological studies have been hyped in the media, often by the scientists who carried them out. It has taken a great deal of effort by other researchers to put the issue in proper perspective. A major problem is the lack of consistent work in the field, a point stressed to me in 2005 – during an earlier outbreak of brain-gender difference stories – by Professor Steve Jones, a geneticist at University College London, and author of Y: The Descent of Men. \\"Researching my book, I discovered there was no consensus at all about the science [of gender and brain structure],\\" he told me. \\"There were studies that said completely contradictory things about male and female brains. That means you can pick whatever study you like and build a thesis around it. The whole field is like that. It is very subjective. That doesn't mean there are no differences between the brains of the sexes, but we should take care not to exaggerate them.\\" Needless to say that is not what has happened over the years. Indeed, this has become a topic whose coverage has been typified mainly by flaky claims, wild hyperbole and sexism. It is all very depressing. The question is: why has this happened? Why is there such divergence in explanations for the differences in mental abilities that we observe in men and women? And why do so many people want to exaggerate them so badly? The first issue is the easier to answer. The field suffers because it is bedevilled by its extraordinary complexity. The human brain is a vast, convoluted edifice and scientists are only now beginning to develop adequate tools to explore it. The use of diffusion tensor imaging by Verma's team was an important breakthrough, it should be noted. The trouble is, once more, those involved were rash in their interpretations of their own work. \\"This study contains some important data but it has been badly overhyped and the authors must take some of the blame,\\" says Professor Dorothy Bishop, of Oxford University. \\"They talk as if there is a typical male and a typical female brain – they even provide a diagram – but they ignore the fact that there is a great deal of variation within the sexes in terms of brain structure. You simply cannot say there is a male brain and a female brain.\\" Even more critical is Marco Catani, of London's Institute of Psychiatry. \\"The study's main conclusions about possible cognitive differences between males and females are not supported by the findings of the study. A link between anatomical differences and cognitive functions should be demonstrated and the authors have not done so. They simply have no idea of how these differences in anatomy translate into cognitive attitudes. So the main conclusion of the study is purely speculative.\\" The study is also unclear how differences in brain architecture between the sexes arose in the first place, a point raised by Michael Bloomfield of the MRC's Clinical Science Centre. \\"An obvious possibility is that male hormones like testosterone and female hormones like oestrogen have different effects on the brain. A more subtle possibility is that bringing a child up in a particular gender could affect how our brains are wired.\\" In fact, Verma's results showed that the neuronal connectivity differences between the sexes increased with the age of her subjects. Such a finding is entirely consistent with the idea that cultural factors are driving changes in the brain's wiring. The longer we live, the more our intellectual biases are exaggerated and intensified by our culture, with cumulative effects on our neurons. In other words, the intellectual differences we observe between the sexes are not the result of different genetic birthrights but are a consequence of what we expect a boy or a girl to be. Why so many people should be so desperate to ignore or obscure this fact is a very different issue. In the end, I suspect it depends on whether you believe our fates are sealed at birth or if you think that it is a key part of human nature to be able to display a plasticity in behaviour and in ways of thinking in the face of altered circumstance. My money is very much on the latter. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The article argues that claims about inherent differences between male and female brains are often exaggerated and based on cultural expectations rather than biological determinism. While there may be some differences in how male and female brains are wired, these differences are likely influenced by upbringing and societal expectations.

The idea that men and women are \\"hardwired\\" for specific tasks is oversimplified, and more research is needed to understand the complex factors that influence brain development and function."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(Photo: Charles Dharapak, AP) Story Highlights President Obama made a statement on Saturday to update the country on his Syria deliberations Members of his national security team briefed lawmakers on Saturday Obama overrode top advisers' objections WASHINGTON — President Obama said on Saturday that he was ready to take military action against Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime in retaliation for its alleged use of chemical weapons, but that he will seek the approval of Congress before carrying out any military strike. Obama says congressional leaders have agreed to schedule a debate and vote when they return to session. They are scheduled to return from their summer recess on Sept. 9. The president did not say whether he'd forgo a strike if Congress rejects his call to action. \\"After careful deliberation, I have decided that the United States should take military action against Syrian regime targets,\\" Obama said. \\"This would not be an open-ended intervention. We would not put boots on the ground. Instead, our action would be designed to be limited in duration and scope. \\"This attack is an assault on human dignity,\\" Obama said of the alleged Aug. 21 chemical assault the U.S. intelligence community has linked to Assad's regime. \\"It also presents a serious danger to our national security.\\" The remarks came amid a flurry of briefings for skeptical lawmakers by the president's national security team. Shouts from hundreds of activists outside the White House protesting against military action could be heard from the Rose Garden shortly before Obama spoke. \\"Over the last several days, we've heard from several members of Congress who want their voices to be heard,\\" Obama said. \\"I absolutely agree.\\" FULL COVERAGE: Latest developments in Syria STORY: 5 possible risks of a U.S. military strike on Syria House Speaker John Boehner announced in a joint statement with the GOP House leadership that he expected to consider a measure that would authorize the president to carry out a military strike the week of Sept. 9. \\"Under the Constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress,\\" the statement said. \\"We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised. This provides the president time to make his case to Congress and the American people.\\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., welcomed Obama's decision. \\"The president's role as commander in chief is always strengthened when he enjoys the expressed support of the Congress,\\" McConnell said. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, praised Obama's decision to seek congressional authorization as \\"absolutely the right decision.\\" Corker in recent weeks had been a public advocate for an authorization vote, contending that the Congress too often takes a back seat on determining critical foreign policy decisions. Obama said some have advised not to seek Congress' approval, noting that the British Parliament this week rejected a similar call for action by Prime Minister David Cameron. Obama also rejected Boehner's notion that he must seek congressional authorization. \\"While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,\\" Obama said. \\"We should have this debate. The issues are too big for business as usual.\\" The president's senior advisers had initially advised him not to seek congressional authorization for a military strike, according to a senior administration official. Obama indicated last Saturday during a National Security Council meeting that he was leaning toward taking action against Syria, but had not made a final decision, said the official, who asked not to be identified to discuss internal deliberations. But when Obama convened his senior advisers on Friday night to tell them he had decided to take military action, he also told his advisers that he would seek Congressional authorization, the official said. In the Friday night meeting and again on Saturday morning, Obama explained his reasoning to his advisers for seeking congressional backing. The same aides who had advised him not to go to lawmakers for backing threw their support behind his plan. Obama's remarks on Saturday afternoon came hours after United Nations experts, who had been collecting samples from last week's alleged chemical weapons strike outside Damascus, left Syria bound for the Netherlands. The chemical weapons experts were working to determine what occurred in the apparent chemical weapons attack near Damascus on Aug. 21, which U.S. intelligence reports say left 1,429 people dead, including 426 children. They have taken blood and urine samples from victims and soil samples from areas where chemical attacks have been reported. The samples will be tested in Europe. Obama attempted to put the onus on Congress, which he suggested has a moral responsibility to take action. He noted that Americans have become weary after more than a decade of war, but that something as heinous as a chemical attack could not be ignored. \\"Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?\\" Obama said. The president had long expressed skepticism about the merits of American involvement in the civil war in Syria that has left more than 100,000 dead. But Obama stated publicly just over a year ago that movement or deployment of chemical weapons was a \\"red line\\" that must not be crossed. The White House had determined earlier this summer that Assad's regime had previously used chemical weapons against rebels and civilians on a small scale, but had resisted taking action or offering any significant new military aid to the rebel groups. Obama said that Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, has advised him that the U.S. military's capacity to execute a strike is not time-sensitive. Five U.S. Navy destroyers equipped with land-attack cruise missiles are deployed in the eastern Mediterranean and stand ready to carry out an assault on the president's order. \\"In the coming days, my administration stands ready to provide every member with the information they need to understand what happened in Syria and why it has such profound implications for America's national security,\\" Obama said. \\"And all of us should be accountable as we move forward, and that can only be accomplished with a vote.\\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/15IWQnI ||||| President Barack Obama says he has decided that the United States should take military action against Syria in response to a deadly chemical weapons attack.

This announcement followed reports of a chemical weapons attack near Damascus on August 21, which U.S. intelligence linked to Assad's regime. The attack allegedly resulted in the deaths of 1,429 people, including 426 children. Obama sought to emphasize the limited duration and scope of the proposed military action, stating that it would not involve putting boots on the ground. Despite initial advice from senior advisers not to seek Congressional authorization, Obama ultimately decided that such authorization would strengthen the country's position and make any actions more effective.

Write a title for this article: On Tuesday, Amy Harmon reported that a prominent professor at the University of Chicago had stepped down in response to accusations of sexual harassment. The article ignited a heated discussion on Twitter, with some readers sharing their experiences of harassment in the science field. The professor, Jason Lieb, a molecular biologist, made unwelcome sexual advances to several female graduate students at an off-campus retreat of the molecular biosciences division, according to a university investigation letter obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Lieb, 43, also engaged in sexual activity with a student who was “incapacitated due to alcohol and therefore could not consent.” The article highlighted an increasingly tense debate over how universities deal with harassment claims in their science departments. Students and faculty members at the University of Chicago blamed the school, saying it overlooked previous accusations against Mr. Lieb when he worked at the University of North Carolina, and did not find out why he resigned abruptly from Princeton University after just seven months. Below is a selection of the responses to the article on Twitter. Some who work in the sciences expressed concerns about encountering harassment: skin crawling. can't say I haven't worried about this kind of thing when considering how to choose a future advisor https://t.co/k0qbBhX0nO Others pointed to how common harassment is in academia: Virtually every female PhD who knows me well enough to tell me abt it has experienced similar in kind, if not degree https://t.co/b2RCamWV34 A few Twitter users from the schools mentioned in the article spoke out: From the perspective of someone at the 1st of the 3 institutions involved, the secrecy is maddening to deal with 1/2 https://t.co/R2JsYmVJzA ...and makes us culpable.

Question: Given the below context: In 1823, brash naval officer David Farragut boards the Essex and informs its commander, David Porter, that the Navy is commandeering the ship for a top-secret mission. Although the crew is overdue for shore leave, Porter, a cold, efficient leader, lies to them in order to coerce them to volunteer for the dangerous assignment. Farragut soon reunites with his old shipmate, Chief Petty Officer Link, who tries to convince him that Porter, who years earlier trained Farragut harshly in an attempt to teach him patience and discipline, is not as heartless as he appears. This starts to show itself when Porter later reconciles with Farragut about their past and agree to be civil with one another. Once the ship is at sea, Porter and Farragut open their orders and are dismayed to discover their mission: to disguise themselves as pirates, with no ties to or protection from the United States, in order to track down pirates raiding the West Indies. One night soon after, Farragut is in charge of the ship when a storm hits. Link becomes trapped beneath a keg of rum from which he has tried to sneak a drink and Farragut is forced to break the ship's rudder to rescue him. Porter discovers the damage, but even when he threatens to court-martial Farragut, the officer refuses to inform on Link. Within days, the supplies begin to run out, one of the crew contracts scurvy, and Porter steers the rudderless Essex to the West Indies for repairs and supplies. Farragut grows frustrated with the slow drift and, although Porter forbids anyone to enter the shark-infested waters, he tries to repair the rudder himself. When a shark attacks and Farragut's rope catches on a barnacle, he is barely rescued in time, and Porter chastises him again. Six days later, the men finally reach land and Porter orders Farragut and Link to gather supplies. Guess a valid title for it!

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I can use this background: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Now, I have a new situation: Robin and Samantha are both bodybuilders preparing for a competition. Both of them are trying to change their skin complexion to help their appearances at the competition. Robin begins exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week. Samantha decides not to use any UV light and instead just uses lotion to help her skin. Answer this question please: Who will produce lower amounts of melanin? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, the number of melanocytes in an individual's skin remains the same regardless of skin color, so the main factor that we can consider is UV light exposure, which increases melanin production. In the given situation, Robin starts exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week, which will stimulate her melanocytes to produce more melanin. On the other hand, Samantha chooses not to expose herself to UV light and just uses lotion on her skin. As a result, her melanocytes will not receive the same UV light stimulation as Robin's. Considering these factors, Samantha will produce lower amounts of melanin than Robin. It's important to note that the amount of melanin in Samantha's skin will still depend on her genetic predisposition and any inborn melanin production. Nonetheless, by not exposing her skin to UV light, Samantha is not artificially boosting her melanin levels like Robin is doing through repeated tanning sessions. Since Robin's tanning regimen is specifically designed to increase melanin production, it's clear that Samantha will have comparatively less melanin in this specific situation. However, the vitamin D production in Samantha might be reduced as well, increasing her risk of deficiency, and it is important to ensure that she obtains vitamin D through other sources like diet or supplements if necessary."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Put them together and, believe it or not, you have an art project that is judged to be worth £50,000 of taxpayers’ money. Artist Simon Faithfull bought the 24ft Brioney Victoria on eBay for £75. He lit smoke bombs to make it look as if it was on fire, then opened its valves, filling it with water. As it sank, he dived into the sea. And the point of this performance? The boat had been fitted with underwater cameras, which will film for a year as it grows into an artificial reef off the Dorset coast. Footage will be sent to a phone app so people can watch live, and will later be made into a film. Scroll down for video. Dramatic display: British artist Simon Faithfull leaps from the side of the concrete fishing boat as it begins to sink off the coast of Weymouth, Dorset. He set off smoke bombs to make it look like the vessel was on fire. The REEF project will cost £120,000, nearly half funded by the Arts Council. The rest will come from European Union grants. Mr Faithfull, 48, the half-brother of singer Marianne Faithfull, said: ‘A boat that was at the end of its life is now starting a new one.’ REEF was commissioned by Fabrica and Photoworks, groups supported by the Arts Council. It cost £80,000 to sink the boat and consult marine experts, of which £32,000 came from the Arts Council. An extra £40,000 will be spent on exhibitions in Brighton and France, of which the Council will pay half. The boat has been fitted with five underwater cameras which will record the 12-month journey of the ‘dead’ boat being brought back to life in the form of an artificial reef for marine life. The footage will be streamed live and a film will eventually be made and shown at art exhibitions. But the project has been slammed by some after it emerged that nearly half of the £120,000 spent on the project has been funded by the British taxpayer through grants from the Arts Council. It was commissioned by Fabrica and Photoworks, two arts organisations in Brighton supported by the Arts Council.The remaining cost has come through European Union arts grants. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers struggling with rising bills will be baffled that they’ve been asked to pay to sink a boat in the name of art. 'If this project was worthwhile then private investment should have been sought. This sort of wasteful spending by unaccountable quangos and local authorities has to come to an end.' Going under: The ship dips below the waves. Five underwater cameras have been attached to the vessel to document the 'dead' ship's journey over the next year as it becomes an artificial reef for marine life. The project, called REEF, has taken three years to come to fruition because of the level of planning and consultation from marine experts required. Mr Faithfull, who is the half-brother of singer Marianne Faithfull, said: 'The idea was to take a boat and send her on a short journey to the bottom of the sea. 'I bought the concrete hull of a disused boat on eBay then added a concrete wheelhouse so it replicated a working boat. We had very strict permissions and the boat was stripped of anything that could potentially be harmful. 'I was on board the boat and we set up pyrotechnics to look like a fire so it looked like the boat was in trouble. 'Then I opened the seacocks and let water into the boat. As it went down I dived off to symbolise abandoning ship. He explained that the boat has been rigged with five cameras that transmitted the sinking and will continue to transmit live for the next year so people can see it transform into a reef. The cameras will broadcast to a mobile app for a year and the film will eventually be shown at exhibitions in Brighton, Calais and Caen in France. Of the £120,000 that the project cost, £80,000 went into buying, building and towing the boat and consulting with marine experts. Of that money, £32,000 was funded by the Arts Council with the rest being met by grants from Interreg, a scheme funded by the European Regional Development Fund to encourage European projects to work together. A further £40,000 will be spent on exhibitions in Brighton, Caen and Calais, half of which will be met by the Arts Council and half by Interreg. Creative family: Simon Faithfull, pictured left, is the half-brother of singer Marianne Faithfull, pictured right earlier this year. One of his recent art projects involved him walking through a burning plane. Laurence Hill from Fabrica, one of the main backers of the project, added: 'Eventually there will be an exhibition at Fabrica with an edited version of the film we took of the sinking. 'In was an amazing success and a real relief after all the planning that has gone into it. It was a relatively expensive project because of all the experts involved in it. Mr Faithfull’s recent art projects have involved films of him walking through a burning plane and walking across the sea bed. He also sent a chair to the edge of space beneath a weather balloon in the name of art.

I, in my entire academic life, have never been careless towards the submission. I always submitted reports or assignments before time. Anyway, the submission day finally arrived. I had told one of the group members to print the report out and bind it and bring to the college with her. The lecture is scheduled at 2:00 pm. I called her for about 30 times asking where she was.

Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D... According to the above context, answer the following question. When are supplements mainly of assistance to people?

Put the berries in a plastic container lined with paper towels. Lay the lid on top of the container so that it's slightly ajar. Keep the berries in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\\"","completion":"Title: The Art of Keeping Berries Fresh: A Guide to Proper Storage Introduction: One of the most delightful aspects of summertime is the abundance of fresh, juicy berries. From blueberries to strawberries, raspberries to blackberries, these tasty fruits are not only delicious, but they are also packed with nutrients and antioxidants. However, one common challenge faced by berry-lovers is that these delicate fruits can spoil very quickly if not stored properly. In this article, we will provide guidance on how to keep your berries fresh for up to five days using a simple and effective storage method. Step 1: Sorting the Berries The first step to ensuring that your berries stay fresh for an extended period is to sort through them and remove any moldy or overripe ones. Overripe berries will continue to deteriorate even when stored correctly, and moldy berries can spread the mold to other healthy ones. By taking the time to inspect and remove these unwanted culprits, you are effectively eliminating the factors that could negatively impact the freshness of your remaining berries. Step 2: Preparing the Container Next, choose a suitable container that can safely hold your berries without crushing them. A plastic container is an ideal choice as it is lightweight, durable, and easy to clean. To absorb excess moisture and create a healthy environment for the berries, line the bottom of the container with paper towels. This layer of absorbent material will help prevent the development of mold and prolong the freshness of your berries. Step 3: Transferring the Berries to the Container Carefully place the sorted berries into the lined container, taking care not to overcrowd them. By leaving some space between the berries, you allow air to circulate more freely around each fruit, helping to prevent moisture buildup that could lead to mold growth. Step 4: Adjusting the Lid When it comes to sealing the container, the trick is to avoid completely closing it. Instead, lay the lid on top of the container so that it is slightly ajar. By creating a small opening, airflow is improved around the berries, allowing excess moisture to escape and preventing the fruits from becoming too damp and overly ripe. Step 5: Storing the Berries Finally, after the container is prepared and the berries are safely nestled inside, place the container in your refrigerator. The optimal temperature should be between 32 to 34 degrees Fahrenheit (0 to 1 degree Celsius), which maintains the cold chain without freezing the berries. By keeping the berries chilled, you are significantly slowing down the natural ripening process, allowing them to stay fresh for up to five days. Conclusion: By following these five simple steps, you can enjoy your favorite berries and prolong their freshness without worrying about waste. This effective storage method not only keeps your fruits in tip-top condition but also guarantees that their delicious taste and essential nutrients are preserved. So go ahead, indulge in your favorite berries, and savor their goodness for days to come."},{"prompt":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: It's ellection time, and mayor George Sitkowski (Bruce Dern) is standing for re-ellection.

University of Notre Dame: Father Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm (1851–1921) who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.

I'd really, really wanted to see this movie, and waited for months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account. When it showed up in our mailbox, I threw it straight into the DVD player. I was very sadly disappointed, which in turn made me mad. I'll give any movie a chance, even if I want to walk out of the theater/press 'stop'. I watched it all the way through, but didn't get anything from it but frustration. The acting was very, very good, but that was about it. Nothing is explained; while we understand that Mathieu becomes depressed and lands in a psych ward of some kind, we're never given insight to his 'downfall'. While we understand that he and Cedric break up, again, we don't see it happen or WHY it happened. During an interview with Mathieu's doctor, Cedric reveals that he'd cheated on him once, but it was no big deal. I expected to see this in flashbacks, but no--nothing. We also gets the hints that Cedric was the one to bring Mat to the hospital--but AGAIN, we don't see it. I know some movies are a 'take it as it is' basis, but this movie honestly ticked me off. When Pierre, Cedric's ex shows up in the club and starts trouble, we don't see hide nor hair of him until near the end, and it took me a good chunk of time to figure out that Pierre WAS the ex. His personality at the club and when Mat finds him are entirely different. I might even be wrong saying this, it was that confusing. The film expects you to know everything and move along with its disjointed, out-of-place and confusing pace.

Title: The Prince and the Pauper Movie plot: In Tudor England, two boys are born on the same day in the most different circumstances imaginable. Tom (Billy Mauch) is the son of vicious criminal John Canty (Barton MacLane), while Edward VI (Bobby Mauch) is a prince and the heir of King Henry VIII of England (Montagu Love). One grows up in poverty, hungering for something better for himself and his family, the other in isolated luxury, with a strong curiosity about the outside world. When they are youngsters, they meet and are astounded by their striking resemblance to each other. As a prank, they exchange clothes, but the Captain of the Guard (Alan Hale, Sr.) mistakes the prince for the pauper and throws him out of the palace grounds. Tom is unable to convince anybody except for the Earl of Hertford (Claude Rains) of his identity. Everyone else is convinced that he is mentally ill. When Henry VIII dies, Hertford threatens to expose Tom unless he does as he is told. Hertford also blackmails the Captain into searching for the real prince to eliminate the dangerous loose end. Meanwhile, Edward finds an amused, if disbelieving protector in Miles Hendon (Errol Flynn). An attempt to assassinate the boy on the instigation of the Earl of Hertford, who fears for his power if the real king lives, changes Hendon's opinion of Edward's story. With Hendon's help, Edward manages to re-enter the palace just in time to interrupt the coronation ceremony and prove his identity. Tom is made a ward of the new king, Hertford is banished for life, and Hendon is rewarded for his services.","completion":"The guard, specifically the Captain of the Guard, mistakes the character of Edward VI (the prince) for a pauper when he is wearing Tom's clothes."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the title of the song that contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords? Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity....

LONG ISLANDERS - 'FELT I HAD A STORY TO TELL THE WORLD' - NYTimes.com ''ROCKY and I have known each other for about 36 years,'' said Ralph Corsel as he reminisced about the former middleweight boxing champion Rocky Graziano. ''One day - this must have been about five years ago - I said, 'Rocky, it's been over 20 years since your first book' -''Somebody Up There Likes Me'' -'came out.' ''So I said, 'Why don't you do another book?' I said, 'I'll do the book for you.' So he said, 'Yeah, go ahead, you want to do it?' He didn't know how involved I'd get with it.'' Mr. Corsel became involved with it to the point that the project is now reality in the form of ''Somebody Down Here Likes Me Too,'' (12.95) by Rocky Graziano with Ralph Corsel, published by Stein & Day. ''I think I probably ran home and started that same day, doing an outline,'' said the 62-year-old Mr. Corsel, who divides his time between homes in Manhattan and East Quogue. To compose the biography - which recapitulates the fighter's troubled youth, including reformatory and prison terms, and takes him through his championship and beyond, into the realm of show business and marriage and celebrity friends and the counselling of delinquent youngsters and jail inmates - Mr. Corsel followed Mr. Graziano around with a tape recorder, interviewed his friends and conducted research in files of old newspapers. ''It's a book about a man who came up as a poor kid and made it in life regardless of all the obstacles that were thrown in his path,'' Mr. Corsel said. ''There's something electrifying about the guy.'' When it comes to colorful lives, Mr. Corsel is no slouch himself. Starting out as Raffaelo Corsalini, the Bronx-born son of Italianimmigrant parents, he was - by his own account - a thief at the age of 9, a reformatory inmate as a teen-ager, a gun moll's boyfriend who worked in a bootlegging plant, and a Depression-era hobo and panhandler who trekked cross-country to California, where he tried to become a professional singer and became instead a pickpocket and confidence man. After Army service in World War II, he came east and worked as a bartender before establishing his own business as a manufacturer's agent. ''All of a sudden,'' he said of his adoption of the salesman's life, ''the money started pouring in like mad. I realized that nothing makes a man honest like money in the bank, and I lost all desire to do anything crooked.'' After a decade, he was able to let others handle his business for him. ''In the back of my mind, ever since I was very young, I always felt I wanted to write - probably because of the life I had led, my background as a kid. I felt I had a story to tell the world.'' Mr. Corsel, whose formal education had ended in the eighth grade (he spent a good many years reading while on the road as a salesman), enrolled in writing courses at the School of General Studies of Columbia University. Within weeks, he said, a short story he had written about his colorful youth prompted his teacher to encourage him to try a novel. The result was ''Up There the Stars,'' an autobiographical novel published in 1968. Mr. Corsel, who has been married twice and has a daughter, went on from here to write columns for Italian-American publications while keeping an eye on his business, traveling and pursuing his hobby of seeing what he can find while roaming here and there with a metal detector. Right now he's at work on a sequel to ''Up There the Stars.'' As for his biography of Mr. Graziano, he said: ''I put a message in the book, to give hope to kids like ourselves who came up out of the bottom of the barrel, to make them feel that if guys like Rocky and myself could make it, then regardless of the poverty and the background, there's always the possibility of making it. ''This is the most beautiful country in the world.''

Corsel and Graziano had known each other for many years, and with Graziano's approval, Corsel went on to write the book titled \\"Somebody Down Here Likes Me Too,\\" published by Stein & Day. The book covers Graziano's life, from his troubled youth and time spent in reformatory and prison, to becoming a boxing champion, show business personality, and a counselor for delinquent youngsters and jail inmates. In the article, Corsel shares how he followed Graziano around with a tape recorder, interviewed his friends, and conducted research in old newspaper files to compose the biography. He mentions that it is a story of a man who succeeded in life despite numerous obstacles. Corsel himself has led a colorful life, having been a thief, reformatory inmate, gun moll's boyfriend, bootlegging plant worker, hobo, and eventually a successful businessman. Corsel's affinity for writing began from a desire to share his story with the world, which led him to enroll in writing courses at Columbia University's School of General Studies. He then penned an autobiographical novel titled \\"Up There the Stars,\\" published in 1968, and continued to write columns for Italian-American publications while overseeing his business. Corsel is currently working on a sequel to his first novel and believes that his biography of Graziano serves as a message of hope for disadvantaged youth, proving that anyone can succeed with determination, regardless of their background."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus. - The Melkite (Greek) Catholic Church (\\"\\") is an Eastern Catholic Church in full communion with the Holy See as part of the worldwide Catholic Church. The Melkites, Byzantine Rite Catholics of mixed Eastern Mediterranean (Levantine) and Greek origin, trace their history to the early Christians of Antioch, formerly part of Syria and now in Turkey, of the 1st century AD, where Christianity was introduced by Saint Peter. It is headed by \\"His Beatitude\\" Patriarch Gregory III Laham. - Gregory III Laham (born Lutfy Laham, December 15, 1933, in Darayya, Syria), Patriarch of Antioch and All the East, and Alexandria and Jerusalem, is the spiritual leader of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, elected on November 29, 2000, succeeding Patriarch Maximos V Hakim. - Macarius IV Tawil ( or Taouil ) was Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church from 1813 to 1815 . - Antioch on the Orontes (also Syrian Antioch) was an ancient Greco-Roman city on the eastern side of the Orontes River. Its ruins lie near the modern city of Antakya, Turkey, and lends the modern city its name. - The Holy See is the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Catholic Church in Rome, the episcopal see of the Pope, and an independent sovereign entity. It serves as the central point of reference for the Catholic Church everywhere and the focal point of communion due to its position as the pre-eminent episcopal see of the universal church. It traces its origin to the 1st century during the apostolic era, when Saint Peter arrived in Rome to evangelise and formed a significant early Christian community of believers there. Today, it is responsible for the governance of all Catholics, organised in their Particular Churches, Patriarchates and religious institutes. - The Levant (Arabic: \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east.

Brazil's Catholic Church is the latest to publicly oppose a controversial revamping of the country's \\"Forest Code,\\" which activists say would cause an environmental disaster. The bill, which was approved by the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies and is now before the Senate, would rewrite some of the rules regarding protected areas, grant amnesty to illegal deforestation that occurred before July 2008, and give states greater control over preservation management. Supporters say that the bill will help landowners, especially small ones -- a large number of whom currently violate existing conservation laws. By changing the way that land set aside for preservation is calculated, it would help many get back within the law. But opponents say easing deforestation laws will give a greenlight to developers and loggers to fell more of the Amazon Rainforest.

Given the question: Given the below context: Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Hippolytus of Rome (170 - 235 AD) was one of the most important 3rd-century theologians in the Christian Church in Rome, where he was probably born. Photios I of Constantinople describes him in his Bibliotheca (cod. 121) as a disciple of Irenaeus, who was said to be a disciple of Polycarp, and from the context of this passage it is supposed that he suggested that Hippolytus so styled himself. However, this assertion is doubtful. Context: As a presbyter of the church at Rome under Pope Zephyrinus (199 - 217 AD), Hippolytus was distinguished for his learning and eloquence. It was at this time that Origen of Alexandria, then a young man, heard him preach. He accused Pope Zephyrinus of modalism, the heresy which held that the names Father and Son are simply different names for the same subject. Hippolytus championed the Logos doctrine of the Greek apologists, most notably Justin Martyr, which distinguished the Father from the Logos (\\"Word\\"). An ethical conservative, he was scandalized when Pope Callixtus I (217 - 222 AD) extended absolution to Christians who had committed grave sins, such as adultery. Hippolytus himself advocated an excessive rigorism. At this time, he seems to have allowed himself to be elected as a rival Bishop of Rome, and continued to attack Pope Urban I (222 - 230 AD) and Pope Pontian ( 230 - 235 AD). G. Salmon suggests that Hippolytus was the leader of the Greek-speaking Christians of Rome. Allen Brent sees the development of Roman house-churches into something akin to Greek philosophical schools gathered around a compelling teacher. Under the persecution at the time of Emperor Maximinus Thrax, Hippolytus and Pontian were exiled together in 235 AD to Sardinia, likely dying in the mines. It is quite probable that, before his death there, he was reconciled to the other party at Rome, for, under Pope Fabian (236-250), his body and that of Pontian were brought to Rome. The so-called chronography of the year 354 (more precisely, the Catalogus Liberianus, or Liberian Catalogue) reports that on August 13, probably in 236 AD, the two bodies were interred in Rome, that of Hippolytus in a cemetery on the Via Tiburtina, his funeral being conducted by Justin the Confessor. This document indicates that, by about 255 AD, Hippolytus was considered a martyr and gives him the rank of a priest, not of a bishop, an indication that before his death the schismatic was received again into the Church. Question: Was he a good leader? Answer:","completion":"Evaluating whether Hippolytus of Rome was a good leader necessitates considering various aspects of his personal and theological contributions as well as the context in which he lived. 1. Theological Knowledge and Eloquence: Hippolytus was reputed for his learning and eloquence, as noted during his time as a presbyter of the Church at Rome. His dedication to the promotion and articulation of the Christian faith demonstrates his commitment to sharing his knowledge and providing strong theological arguments. 2. Defense against Heresies: Hippolytus actively fought against theological heresies, such as modalism. In doing so, he upheld the integrity of Christian doctrines. Championing the Logos doctrine, which distinguished the Father from the Logos (\\"Word\\"), further demonstrates his commitment to protecting and preserving the purity of Christian beliefs. 3. Ethical Conservatism and Rigorism: Hippolytus was an ethical conservative, upholding traditional Christian values, especially in matters of morality. However, his rigorism often led to him advocating excessively strict policies, which may have alienated some believers who sought forgiveness and reconciliation within the Church. 4. Schismatic Behavior and Rivalry: While Hippolytus showcased strong leadership qualities, his actions in allowing himself to be elected as a rival Bishop of Rome and his persistent attacks on Popes Urban I and Pope Pontian indicate an inclination toward divisiveness rather than unity within the Christian Church. 5. Possible Reconciliation: It is believed that Hippolytus might have reconciled with the Church in Rome before his death. His burial in Rome and eventual recognition as a martyr and priest suggest that the schism might have been resolved and that Hippolytus may have been incorporated back into the Church community. In conclusion, whether Hippolytus was a good leader is a matter of interpretation. On the one hand, he displayed theological wisdom, eloquence, and the ability to provide compelling arguments against heresies. On the other hand, his rigorism and involvement in schismatic behaviors indicate a more divisive and unyielding approach to leadership. It is important to consider both the positive and negative aspects of his leadership style and the environment in which he lived to form a well-rounded opinion on his effectiveness as a leader."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I heard that Kai needed a bedtime story each night before going to sleep. And I was wondering How would Kai feel as a result? Answer:","completion":"In order to answer this question, I will first assume that Kai enjoys bedtime stories. Now, let me analyze step-by-step the possible feelings Kai might experience as a result of listening to a bedtime story each night. Step 1: Setting the context The bedtime story routine creates a calming and soothing environment for Kai. Creating a specific time and place for a story can signal to their brain that it's time to wind down and get ready for sleep. Step 2: Emotional connection During the bedtime story, Kai might feel a stronger emotional connection with the person reading the story to them, such as a parent or guardian. This shared time can build trust and a sense of safety in the relationship. Step 3: Impact on imagination and creativity Bedtime stories can stimulate Kai's imagination and creativity, as they listen to various stories featuring different characters, settings, and scenarios. This can make them feel excited and intrigued by the endless possibilities within the stories. Step 4: Developing empathy and understanding As Kai listens to different stories with characters facing various challenges or displaying particular emotions, they might develop empathy and understanding for others' feelings and situations. This can make them feel more connected to the world and the people around them. Step 5: Sense of comfort and relaxation Finally, the act of listening to a bedtime story can provide a sense of comfort and relaxation, as they unwind from the day and let their mind be transported into the story they are hearing. This can result in a feeling of contentment and peace. Based on these steps, it is reasonable to conclude that Kai would feel comforted, connected, and relaxed as a result of listening to a bedtime story each night before going to sleep."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles. LaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina – an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue. The group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman, the \\"mestigoit\\", is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest.

Answer based on context: Coming off their hard-fought win over the Ravens, the Broncos traveled to Arrowhead Stadium for an AFC West duel with the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday Night Football. There was no scoring in the first quarter, which included cornerback David Bruton forcing a fumble off Chiefs' running back Jamaal Charles at the Broncos' 6-yard line. The Chiefs grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with Charles rushing for a 34-yard touchdown, then added to their lead, when cornerback Marcus Peters returned an interception off Broncos' quarterback Peyton Manning 55 yards for a touchdown. The Broncos responded with two touchdown passes by Manning &#8212; a 16-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders followed by a 1-yard juggling touchdown catch by tight end Virgil Green just before halftime. The latter scoring play came after Chiefs' quarterback Alex Smith was intercepted by cornerback Aqib Talib deep in Chiefs' territory. That was Talib's 2nd pick in as many weeks. The two teams exchanged field goals in the third quarter &#8212; a 35-yarder by Chiefs' placekicker Cairo Santos and a 54-yarder by Broncos' placekicker Brandon McManus. Following an exchange of punts, the Chiefs were attempting to re-claim the lead midway through the fourth quarter, when Smith was intercepted by cornerback Chris Harris, Jr. at the Broncos' 10-yard line with 6:40 remaining. However, the Broncos went three-and-out, and were forced to punt. The Chiefs took a 24-17 lead six plays later, with running back Knile Davis rushing for an 8-yard touchdown with 2:27 left in the game.

Answer the question...who was the 13th president of the united states and where was he born??","completion":"The 13th President of the United States was Millard Fillmore. Born on January 7, 1800, Fillmore grew up in the Finger Lakes region of New York in a town called Summerhill. His parents, Nathaniel Fillmore and Phoebe Millard, were farmers and Fillmore was the second of nine children in the family. He was raised in an environment with limited resources and very little formal education. Early in his life, Millard Fillmore worked various jobs to support his family and gained knowledge through reading, displaying traits of self-discipline, determination, and hard work. Eventually, he found his calling in law and became an apprentice in a law office. After several years of hard work and self-education, Fillmore was admitted to the New York bar in 1823. He built a successful legal practice and became active in local politics, eventually joining the anti-Masonic and anti-Jacksonian political movements that were prevalent at that time. His political career began with his election to the New York State Assembly in 1828, and later to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1832. Millard Fillmore served three successive terms from 1833 to 1839, and during his time in Congress, he focused on issues ranging from infrastructure to national fiscal policy. Fillmore became a member of the newly-formed Whig party and in 1848, he was nominated as the vice presidential candidate to run alongside the party's presidential candidate, General Zachary Taylor. In the election that year, the Whig party won the presidency, and Fillmore became the 12th Vice President of the United States. However, on July 9, 1850, only sixteen months into his term, President Zachary Taylor passed away, thrusting Fillmore into the role of the 13th President of the United States. One of the most significant events during Fillmore's tenure was the Compromise of 1850, a series of legislative measures aimed at resolving the issues of expanding slavery in the newly acquired territories as a result of the Mexican-American War. Fillmore supported the compromise, which temporarily eased the tensions between the North and South, but its provisions were seen as controversial, and its effects would later contribute to the outbreak of the American Civil War. Millard Fillmore's presidency concluded on March 4, 1853, after he failed to secure his party's nomination for a second term. He retired to his home in Buffalo, New York, where he continued to be involved in various local and national issues. He passed away on March 8, 1874, at the age of 74."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Fact 2: Basalts are volcanic, micro-crystalline rock. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What is broken down from larger to smaller pieces by weather in weathering?\\" with the following options: - glass - basalt - calcite - soils - fire - water - air - sand Answer:","completion":"Basalt is broken down from larger to smaller pieces by weather in the process of weathering. To provide a comprehensive explanation, let's examine each option in the context of weathering. 1. Glass: While glass can be physically broken by external forces, it is typically a human-made material and not a natural product of geological processes. Thus, it is not relevant to the process of weathering. 2. Basalt: Basalt is a volcanic, micro-crystalline rock, formed from the rapid cooling of lava rich in minerals like plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine. Over time, basalt experiences weathering due to the exposure to elements like water, wind, and temperature fluctuations. This causes the rock to break down into smaller pieces, such as pebbles, gravel, or sand. Therefore, basalt is the correct answer. 3. Calcite: Calcite is a carbonate mineral found in many sedimentary rocks like limestone or in metamorphosed marble. While calcite indeed undergoes weathering through processes such as dissolution and carbonation, the given facts do not relate to calcite specifically as they referred to basalt and weathering in general. 4. Soils: Unlike rocks and minerals, soils are a product of the weathering process. Weathering breaks down rocks, transforming them into smaller particles that combine with organic matter to create soil. Therefore, soil is a result of weathering rather than something broken down in the process. 5. Fire: Fire is a product of combustion, a chemical reaction, and not a substance or material that undergoes weathering. It does not fit within the context of the question. 6. Water: Water is one of the primary agents of weathering that contributes to the breakdown of rocks through processes like freeze-thaw, hydration, and dissolution. While water plays a significant role in weathering, it does not break down into smaller pieces itself. 7. Air: Similar to water, air acts as an agent of weathering, primarily through wind erosion or as a facilitator of chemical reactions. However, air is not a material that is broken down during the weathering process. 8. Sand: Sand is a product of weathering and can be created through the breakdown of various rocks, including basalt. Weathering breaks down rocks into smaller particles, such as sand. Sand, therefore, results from weathering rather than undergoing the process itself. In conclusion, given the two facts provided and the available options, basalt is the correct answer to the question \\"What is broken down from larger to smaller pieces by weather in weathering?\\" Basalt, a volcanic rock, undergoes weathering through exposure to natural elements, breaking down into smaller particles such as sand or gravel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a title for this article: Fact: I am a Christian. Fact: For too long, many in the Christian church have stood on the wrong side of the gay/lesbian issue. Instead of standing with homosexuals, many in my tradition, and I was one of these once, have mistakenly thought we were upholding the Bible and protecting what we presumed was normal--being straight--from abnormal--being gay. But, more often, we were just hiding our anxiety, as well as our ignorance on the matter, by judging gays and lesbians and disassociating from them. But, no matter what our opinion may be, it was wrong then, and it is wrong today, to be misinformed, to judge or, worse, to disassociate from other people. Anyone with any sense of sanity grieves over the sad consequences of the recently reported bullying of gay teens that resulted in their suicides. I suppose these tragic reports have caused all of us to wake up a bit to the bullying that's been tolerated far too long on school playgrounds, in church sanctuaries and from Christian pulpits. This madness must end. What is clear to me today is this: when prejudice is in the heart, as it is in many toward the LGBT community, you can and will find the scripture to defend your position and to justify your intolerance. For centuries, Christians and churches engaged in this sort of insanity to defend slavery and oppress women. Surprisingly, there are still churches that subjugate women and vigorously defend this prejudice with scripture. They mistakenly think they are just being true to the teachings of Saint Paul regarding the roles of men and women in the world and in the church. But, using any portion of the Bible to justify prejudice of any kind is to demean the scriptures and to damage human beings in the process. It is past time for this abuse of scripture to end, as well as the fear and prejudice that motivates it. How can I claim to be following the compassionate Christ while fostering fear, bigotry, or disgust in my heart? For all I don't know, this much I do know: First, it is inconsistent, not to speak of downright dishonest, to condemn homosexuals on the grounds the Bible says it is \\"bad, wrong, or evil.\\" Rape, child abuse, promiscuity, and exploitation are a few acts described in the Bible as \\"bad, wrong, or evil.\\" And these are evils can, and are, committed by people, homosexual and heterosexual alike. What the church should be concerned about is the protection of all people from harm, including dangerous clergypersons, who rape, abuse, and exploit others. Second, gays don't \\"choose\\" to be gay any more than straight people \\"choose\\" to be straight. So, Christians should stop pretending this is a lifestyle choice. Third, sexual orientation is not a political or military issue as in this debacle that is the \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" debate. It is instead a civil rights issue. How two-faced can we be to argue against human rights violations in other countries while depriving people of their civil rights in our own? One more thing. The legacy media need to stop reporting on this issue primarily from the perspective of \\"Christians\\" who are opposed to the LGBT community. Not all Christians feel that gay people are sinners for being gay. So, I'm asking the media to give an equal voice to the straight Christian community that stands in solidarity with the gay Christian community. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, \\"Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter most.\\" This matters. And, if you're like me, you're ready to take your stand with all people. You're tired of the judging of others and the division it causes. You want, as I do, to practice living like Christ who said, \\"Judge not,\\" (Matt. 7:1) and \\"Do to others as you wish them to do to you,\\" (Matt. 7;12); like the Buddha who said, \\"Have compassion for all beings;\\" and, like Muhammad who said, \\"No man is a true believer unless he desires for his brother that which he desires for himself.\\" Steve McSwain is the author of The Enoch Factor: The Sacred Art of Knowing God.

The progressive agenda has always appeared to have wholly secular roots and no legitimate appeal to people of faith. It has always felt like the progressive agenda attempts to appeal to Christian compassion and morality are after thoughts not central tenets. The true agenda instead seems to be specifically to throw off any vestige of religious morality in society; to somehow recreate society absent God. More French Revolution than American Revolution.

Those who promote it simply don't understand Christian teaching. Jesus did not change the law rather he fulfilled it. What that means is that it is still wrong to do the things proscribed. However, when we fail to do so and confess our sins to Jesus asking for forgiveness, His death on the cross covers our sins (hence the reason why you don't see anyone stoning adulterers any longer). Dietary laws were also not applied to \\"gentile\\" Christians after the Acts 15 council. So, to describe Christians as inconsistent on this issue is to be the \\"cherry-picker\\" not the full counsel of scripture guy. Straight Christians who support homosexuals are consistently those who have, for about a hundred years or so, changed their interpretations of the Bible in the name of \\"modernity\\". These \\"liberal\\" Christians find much in common with Obama's \\"many roads to God\\". The secularists, & the liberal Christians, Jews, Muslims bear in mind jonswitzer is 100% correct. When you appeal any decrypt scripture you are out of luck. All progress is only possible when you do not appeal to scripture. Take slavery, civil rights, human rights were only possible when you made secular appeals. The innate fairness of most people will prevail. Those who do not have that will fall in place after a generation or two. Nothing tangible is achieved, without safeguarding the progress made with utmost vigil for a few generations. The secularists must launch a two pronged strategy. 1) We need to proselytize for the progressive agenda, using secular arguments only. If we have to throw a bone once in a while to the liberal religious crowd we should. But the emphasis is secular arguments of fairness. 2) We need to erode the credibility of scripture all the time, incessantly. The goal is to relegate religion to the dust heap of history. This has been done before several times and successfully too. Each and every time one religion has replaced the another. In the past it has been a religion replacing another and mostly by force. This time it has to be religion & superstition replaced by reason.

It is equally true that they choose how they act upon their orientation. To say one is oriented toward a particular sexual behavior does not mean one should act upon it. How many would say one whose sexual orientation is toward six year olds should feel free to act upon that orientation? Unless you are willing to permit such behavior on the basis that one is oriented toward it, ask yourself how strongly you feel sexual orientation should sanction sexual behavior.

Furthermore, when you read Paul's writings in 1 Corinthians 5:9-11: \\"9 I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral peopleâ 10 not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters.

So, lets stop using the word \\"marriage\\" in all laws and keep the word \\"marriage\\" exclusive to religious organizations who want to convey the blessing of their faith on a civil union.

There have always been gays in the military, sleeping in the same barracks with straights, protecting their buddies backs in a fight, and killing the enemy. DADT is a way to perpetuate a lie - that gays are not in the military. DADT is dishonorable on its face - requiring a person to lie, or at least to deceive. How can we ask those who do us the honor of protecting us to behave dishonorably?

I see nothing wrong with admitting that the Bible says \\"no\\", but leave it as a personal matter and preach against persecution. On the other hand, for gays to insist that the label \\"marriage\\" be used on their unions is quite selfish. The military issue is separate. The public concept of civil rights doesn't necessarily apply. Furthermore, I have lived in the same house with gays and we all got on quite well. But I would not want to share a dorm room with one. Posted by: hipshot | November 9, 2010 7:24 AMReport Offensive Comment It is true people do not choose their sexual orientation. It is equally true that they choose how they act upon their orientation. To say one is oriented toward a particular sexual behavior does not mean one should act upon it. How many would say one whose sexual orientation is toward six year olds should feel free to act upon that orientation? Unless you are willing to permit such behavior on the basis that one is oriented toward it, ask yourself how strongly you feel sexual orientation should sanction sexual behavior.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The latest fashion in the kitchen is the food steamer.All the stores are selling them;everyone wants one.Steaming is one of the simplest and healthiest ways of cooking food.However,that cooking time is usually longer than with other methods.In case you're thinking of buying a steamer,I've done a survey about the steamers available on the market to help you decide which will suit you best. Folding Steamer The simplest and least expensive is the folding stainless-steel version. Advantages:This is a good,basic design which sits inside a variety of different shapes of pans with the water under it;a ring in the centre allows for easy lifting and it's easy to clean. Disadvantages:It only holds small dishes.Also,if you put too much water in the pan,it will boil up through the vegetables and they will be watery.If you put too little water in and let it get dry,you will burn the pan and get strange-smelling vegetables. Steaming Pan This is a three-layered black Teflon-coated version with a lid and two double-handled steamers,which sits on the oven ring.The brand I bought is calledNutritious Living. Advantages:This is an excellent steamer, lightweight,easy to clean,and of all the steamers I've tried,this cooks the fastest.Fish and chicken can be cooked on the bottom with rice or vegetables on the top.It's easier to store. Disadvantages:Water can boil away until the pan is dry,but if you make sure you fill the pan up to the suggested level and do not overcook the food,this should not happen.You cannot see the food cooking from the top.It doesn't supply a dish for cooking rice. For serious users of steamers,I recommend having one of each version.If you just want to try it,get the folding stainless-steel type. Question: Which of the following is true about the folding steamers? Answer: Options are: A). They are cheap and easy to use.. B). They are difficult to clean.. C).

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Barack Obama, Lady Gaga and Steve Jobs--what do they have in common? They are, of course, all Americans. And according to a survey by social networking site badoo. com, they all best illustrate the word \\"cool\\". But just what does it mean to say someone is \\"cool\\"? Most would answer that it is something to do with being independent-minded and not following the crowd. Yale University art professor Robert Farris Thompson says that the term \\"cool\\" goes back to 15th century West African philosophy . \\"Cool\\" relates to ideas of grace under pressure. \\"In Africa, \\" he writes, \\"coolness is a positive quality which combines calmness, silence, and life. \\" The modern idea of \\"cool\\" developed largely in the US in the period after World War II. \\"Post-war 'cool' was in part an expression of war-weariness . . . it went against the strict social rules of the time, \\" write sociologists Dick Pountain and David Robins in Cool Rules: Anatomy of an Attitude. But it was the American actor James Dean who became the symbol for \\"cool\\" in the hugely successful 1955 movie Rebel without a Cause. Dean plays a tough guy who disobeys his parents and the authorities . He always gets the girl, smokes cigarettes, wears a leather jacket and beats up bullies . In the movie, Dean showed what \\"cool\\" would mean to American young people for the next 60 years. Today the focus of \\"cool\\" has changed to athletics stars. Often in movies about schools, students gain popularity on the athletics field more than in the classroom. This can be seen quite clearly in movies like Varsity Blues and John Tucker Must Die. But many teenagers also think being smart is cool. Chess and other thinking games have been becoming more popular in schools. \\"Call it the Harry Potterization of America --a time when being smart is the new cool, \\" writes journalist Joe Sunnen. Question: If you were considered \\"cool\\" in Africa in the 15th century, you _ .

But a federal appeals court has now overturned that decision. The lawsuit was filed by a woman who claims she was drugged and raped by men who had contacted her through the website. The woman, referred to in court documents as Jane Doe, was an aspiring model who had created a profile on Model Mayhem. She claims she was contacted and invited to a casting session in 2011, but it was a sham and she was drugged and then raped on camera by two men. Two men were jailed for such a scam in 2012. The woman claims Internet Brands was aware that people were using the Model Mayhem site to target women in this way, but failed to warn its members, making it liable for negligence under California law. Internet Brands filed a motion to have the case dismissed on the grounds that it was barred by the US Communications Decency Act (CDA), which says websites cannot be held responsible for content posted by their users. \\"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider,\\" the law states. At the time, online giants including eBay and Facebook told the court that the lawsuit would have a \\"chilling effect\\" on the internet. The district court dismissed the lawsuit in 2014. However, a federal appeals court in California has now revived the lawsuit because it does not concern what was posted on Model Mayhem. \\"Jane Doe does not claim to have been lured by any posting that Internet Brands failed to remove. Internet Brands is also not alleged to have learned of the predators' activity from any monitoring of postings on the website,\\" the court wrote. \\"Instead, Jane Doe attempts to hold Internet Brands liable for failing to warn her about information it obtained from an outside source about how third parties targeted and lured victims through Model Mayhem. \\"Internet Brands could have given a warning to Model Mayhem users, perhaps by posting a notice on the website or by informing users by email what it knew about the activities.\\" A trial court must now decide whether the \\"failure to warn\\" lawsuit can go ahead. \\"We express no opinion on the viability of the failure to warn allegations,\\" the federal court wrote. \\"We hold only that the CDA is not a valid basis to dismiss Jane Doe's complaint.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The article talks about a court case involving a website called Model Mayhem.

Q:Mike was visiting the African Savannah. One animal that interested him most was the African Buffalo. He noticed that the buffaloes would usually live in a large herd, often exceeding few hundreds. He noted that as case A. But sometimes the buffaloes would live in a small herd. He noted that as case B. Interestingly, there are incidents when an aggressive male buffalo would live by itself. He noted that as case C. In which case the group would get less benefit as a whole, case A or case B? Hint: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases. A:","completion":"Based on the hint provided and the concept of the dilution effect, it is important to understand that animals living in larger groups tend to dilute their risk of attack, leading to increased safety for each individual. In the case of the African Buffalo, the dilution effect would play a significant role in defining the benefits to individuals depending on the size of the group. In case A, when buffaloes live in a large herd often exceeding hundreds, the dilution effect is more pronounced, providing increased safety from predators and other potential threats. This increased safety benefits each individual buffalo, as the risk of being attacked is spread across a larger number of individuals. This is similar to the examples provided in the hint, where larger groups of Camargue horses and water striders experienced decreased attack rates per individual. In case B, when buffaloes live in a small herd, the dilution effect is less pronounced, which means that the benefits from the group living are not as strong as in case A. Under these circumstances, each individual buffalo is relatively more exposed to potential threats as compared to case A, and the risk of attack is not as effectively spread across the smaller number of individuals. Considering the dilution effect and its benefits to individual animals within a group, the African Buffalo would experience greater benefits as a whole in case A when living in a large herd. In this scenario, the risk of attack is more effectively spread across the numerous individuals in the group, providing increased safety for each buffalo. On the contrary, case B, with smaller herds, would provide less benefit to the group as a whole due to a weaker dilution effect. Thus, the African Buffalo group in case A is better off in terms of safety and overall benefits as compared to case B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of hanging mugs from a pole, I would follow these steps: Step 1: Gather materials First, I would gather the necessary materials such as a sturdy pole, preferably made of metal or wood, strong hooks or mug holders, and the mugs to be hung. The pole should be long enough to accommodate the desired number of mugs and the hooks must be able to securely hold the weight of the mugs. Step 2: Determine the desired height and location Next, I would choose an appropriate location for the pole, considering factors such as accessibility and aesthetics. I would also decide on the height of the pole, ensuring it is installed at a level that is both practical and comfortable for users. Step 3: Install the pole Once the location and height are determined, I would securely install the pole. If mounting on a wall, I would find the studs in the wall, mark the screws' positions, and drill holes for the screws. Next, I would insert the screws through the pole's brackets into the drilled holes and tighten until secure. If using a freestanding pole, I would assemble the pole according to the manufacturer's instructions and ensure it is stable and level on the floor. Step 4: Attach hooks or mug holders Now that the pole is in place, I would attach the hooks or mug holders to the pole. I would space them evenly apart, taking into account the size and shape of the mugs being hung. Each hook should be sturdy enough to hold the weight of the mug without bending or breaking. Step 5: Hang the mugs With the hooks or mug holders in place, I would carefully hang each mug by its handle. I would arrange the mugs in a visually pleasing manner, considering factors such as size, color, and design. If the pole is accessible from all sides, I would hang the mugs to evenly distribute their weight all around the pole. Step 6: Inspect the setup Finally, I would inspect the entire setup to ensure its stability, security, and functionality. I would check that the pole is firmly in place, the hooks are holding the mugs securely, and the entire structure can withstand day-to-day use without any risk of falling or causing injury. Once these steps are completed, the goal of hanging mugs from a pole would be successfully accomplished."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Process: - Warm water floats up from the ocean - A pocket of low pressure air is created near the surface of the ocean - Warm air from outside areas pushes into the low pressure area - The warm air keeps rising and forms clouds - The wind is getting fed moisture that evaporates from the ocean - This moisture causes the swirling air and clouds to grow bigger - As it gets bigger the wind rotates faster. Question: suppose less warm water floats up from the ocean happens, how will it affect LESS POWERFUL hurricanes. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: Less If less warm water floats up from the ocean, the impact on hurricane formation will make them less powerful. Warm water is a critical component in the development of a hurricane as it provides energy to fuel the system. The process of hurricane formation involves a series of steps, starting with the warming of water near the ocean surface. When less warm water is available, the following consequences can be expected: 1. The formation of a pocket of low-pressure air near the ocean surface will be diminished, as the required energy from the warm water is not sufficient. Low-pressure systems are crucial in driving the circulation of a hurricane. 2. The warm air from neighboring areas will not be able to push into the low-pressure area as effectively. Warm air movement is important in supplying moisture and heat to the developing storm system, which in turn powers a hurricane's intensification. 3. The ensuing rise of warm air and the cloud formation process will not be as vigorous. This lack of intense development weakens the potential for the characteristic hurricane spiral and vertical cloud structure. Both are key factors in making a storm system powerful. 4. As there is less moisture being fed to the system from the reduced evaporation of warm ocean waters, the growth and expansion of the swirling air and clouds slow down. The wind rotation may not reach high speeds common in powerful hurricanes, effectively reducing overall storm strength. 5. Since the wind speed plays a major role in the classification of hurricane categories, a slower wind will result in a less powerful hurricane. Hurricanes with stronger winds are associated with greater potential for destruction. In conclusion, if less warm water floats up from the ocean, it will lead to less powerful hurricanes. This is due to a series of interconnected factors that play vital roles in a hurricane's formation and intensification, with the warm water acting as the powerhouse for these processes. Without an ample supply of warm water, a developing hurricane will lose much of its strength and potential to cause widespread damage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When we walked into Papillon Bleu, a Chinese restaurant around the corner from Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal's Old Port, the sole waiter on duty looked surprised to see us. At 7:45 on a Saturday night, at the height of tourist season, just one young white family sat in the dining room. We walked past them to a table in the back, Chopin drifting quietly from the speakers into the certain shade of dim light that only Chinese restaurants seem to have. At our seats, bright yellow napkins, folded into fans, rested on a blue tablecloth next to cutlery . Sometime in the last 18 years of operation, Papillon Bleu stopped bothering with chopsticks. \\"How did you find out about us?\\"our waiter politely asked. I told him that my family used to own a Chinese restaurant that served peanut butter dumplings and I wanted to taste them again. Papillon Bleu came up when I googled\\"Best Peanut Butter Dumplings in Montreal\\". He shook his head and told us that while it might have been the case a few years ago, they had switched peanut butter brands to cut costs. But the significance for me wasn't which brand they used, it was that they served peanut butter dumplings. Commonly known as Hunan dumplings, this specialty exists neither in China, nor anywhere else in North America. Instead, Hunan dumplings are a unique Quebecois tradition, and a slowly dying one, found in the second-generation Chinese family restaurants. Peanut butter dumplings taste exactly how they sound, but also unlike anything else. It is a kind of dumpling that coats your mouth with a distinct store-brand quality, a little too sweet, but buttery, and luxuriously warm, perfectly suited to resist the bone-chilling effects of the Montreal winter.

Since 2004, 'The Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands' has fought for independence from which country?","completion":"The Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands, an unrecognized and symbolic micronation, declared its struggle for independence from Australia since 2004. The Coral Sea Islands are a group of uninhabited islets located east of the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia, and they encompass an extensive area within the Coral Sea. The establishment of this unique micronation was a direct response to the Australian government's refusal to recognize same-sex marriage as legal and legitimate. At the time, the Marriage Amendment Act 2004 had just been passed, subsequently defining marriage exclusively as the union of a man and a woman in Australia. In response, a group of LGBTQ+ activists sailed to the Coral Sea Islands, raised the flag of the Gay and Lesbian Kingdom on Cato Island, which would then serve as the capital of the new nation, and declared independence from Australia on June 14, 2004. Led by their emperor, Dale Anderson, the micronation adopted a national flag based on the pride flag commonly used by the LGBTQ+ community, the rainbow flag. The Gay and Lesbian Kingdom also chose the iconic gay anthem, \\"I Am What I Am,\\" by the late Gloria Gaynor, as their national anthem. Additionally, they adopted the slogan \\"The kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands is not a micronation for the gay and lesbian elite, but a nation for all who are gay or support gay rights.\\" While the micronation declared itself as a constitutional monarchy, it lacked any real authority, political structure, or physical territory beyond the uninhabited Coral Sea Islands. Its claim for independence from Australia has never been officially recognized by any government, and it remains largely a symbolic and political statement to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, particularly marriage equality. In December 2017, Australia finally legalized same-sex marriage through a postal survey that recorded nearly 62% of respondents voting in favor of marriage equality. As a result, the significance and symbolic resonance of the Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands have shifted, and its relevance in the modern pursuit for LGBTQ+ rights continues to evolve."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday.

Each of these animals, clearly intent on eating the mouse, invites him back to their home for a meal. The cunning mouse declines each offer. To dissuade further advances, he tells each animal that he is going to dine with his friend, a gruffalo, whose favourite food happens to be the relevant animal.

Originally limited to researchers at a handful of universities and government departments, the Internet has quickly become a worldwide network providing users with information on a range of subjects and allowing them to purchase goods directly from companies via computer. By 1999, 84 millionU.S.citizens had access to the Internet at home or work. More and more Americans arc paying bills, shopping, ordering airline tickets, and purchasing stocks via computer over the Internet. Internet banking is also becoming increasingly popular. With lower overhead costs in terms of staffing and office space, Internet banks are able to offer higher interest rates on deposits and charge lower rates on loans than traditional banks. \\"Brick and mortar\\" banks are increasingly offering online banking services via some special websites to enlarge their traditional services. At present, 14 percent of Internet households conduct their banking by means of the Internet, and the figure is expected to double during the next two or three years. Increasing commercial use of the Internet has heightened security and privacy concerns. With a credit card, an Internet user can order almost anything from an Internet site and have it delivered to their home or office. Companies doing business over the Internet need many security measures to protect credit card, bank account, and social security numbers from unauthorized access as they pass across the Internet.

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (English: chy-KOF-skee; Russian: Пётр Ильи́ч Чайко́вский, tr. Pyótr Ilʹyích Chaykóvskiy, IPA: [pʲɵtr ɪlʲˈjitɕ tɕɪjˈkofskʲɪj] (listen); 7 May 1840 [O.S. 25 April] – 6 November [O.S. 25 October] 1893), was a Russian composer of the romantic period, whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension. Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity...

The premise explains a situation where an adult is demonstrating how to do something to teach a young child. However, it does not give specific details about what activity they are engaged in. While it could be possible that they are watching an instructional video or something related to their activity on television, they could also be engaged in an entirely different activity, such as cooking, painting, playing a musical instrument, or any number of hands-on learning experiences. In many learning scenarios involving an adult and a child, the exchange of knowledge takes place through different methodologies. It could be oral communication, visually demonstrating a task, or hands-on practice, often depending on the interest and abilities of the child. Therefore, without more explicit information about their activity, it is not possible to conclude that watching television is central to their learning experience. Furthermore, it is essential to note that learning interactions between adults and children are vast and varied. These interactions are shaped by factors such as age, culture, tradition, personal values, and the context in which they are in. Moreover, television is only one of the many tools that adults can use to teach children new skills or concepts.

OPTIONS: [I] yes [II] it is not possible to tell [III] no","completion":"[II] it is not possible to tell The statement \\"The Clinton surrogates also held the high ground in the context war.\\" suggests that the supporters of Clinton were effective in framing the political discussions in a way that benefits their candidate, by holding the high ground in the context war. However, this statement does not provide enough information to determine whether the Clinton supporters should be admired or not. Admiration is a subjective emotion that is often tied to one's personal values, beliefs, and perceptions. One person may admire the Clinton surrogates for their ability to seize the high ground in the context war, while another person may disapprove of their tactics or not be impressed by their success. In addition, the term \\"high ground\\" is open to interpretation. It could mean that the Clinton supporters were more successful in shaping the narrative or it could mean that they took a more morally or ethically superior stance in the debates and discussions. Depending on these interpretations, one's admiration for the Clinton surrogates may differ. Furthermore, the statement is limited in scope and does not provide a holistic view of the Clinton supporters' actions, their motivations, or their impact on the political landscape. It would be helpful to know more about the specific tactics they employed, the issues they prioritized, and how these choices influenced public opinion and voter behavior. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to definitively conclude that \\"The Clinton supporters were to be admired.\\" One needs more context and information on their actions, motivations, and consequences to make a well-informed determination about the level of admiration that they may deserve."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: This article: Whales have also played a role in sacred texts such as the Bible. It mentions whales in Genesis 1:21, Job 7:12, and Ezekiel 32:2. The \\"leviathan\\" described at length in Job 41:1-34 is generally understood to refer to a whale. The \\"sea monsters\\" in Lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word \\"jackals\\" instead. The story of Jonah being swallowed by a great fish is told both in the Qur'an and in the Bible. A medieval column capital sculpture depicting this was made in the 12th century in the abbey church in Mozac, France. The Old Testament contains the Book of Jonah and in the New Testament, Jesus mentions this story in Matthew 12:40.In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, 1585, and Francois, Duke of Anjou, 1582, were greeted on his ceremonial entry into the port city of Antwerp by floats including \\"Neptune and the Whale\\", indicating at least the city's dependence on the sea for its wealth.In 1896, an article in The Pall Mall Gazette popularised a practice of alternative medicine that probably began in the whaling town of Eden, Australia two or three years earlier. It was believed that climbing inside a whale carcass and remaining there for a few hours would relief symptoms of rheumatism.Whales continue to be prevalent in modern literature. For example, Herman Melville's Moby Dick features a \\"great white whale\\" as the main antagonist for Ahab, who eventually is killed by it. The whale is an albino sperm whale, considered by Melville to be the largest type of whale, and is partly based on the historically attested bull whale Mocha Dick. Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories includes the story of \\"How the Whale got in his Throat\\". Niki Caro's film the Whale Rider has a Māori girl ride a whale in her journey to be a suitable heir to the chieftain-ship.

Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe. His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\"....

It's not clear when investigators might talk to Sailor, who despite being bloodied and suffering a broken wrist, pulled herself from the wreckage and walked to the nearest home. She was dressed for Florida, where her family had been visiting, and was wearing shorts, a short-sleeve shirt and only one sock when she found a home about a mile from the crash site. Authorities said she walked through thick woods and briar patches in near-freezing temperatures. \\"She absolutely went to the nearest house that she could have,\\" Kentucky State Police Lt. Brent White said. \\"But it was still a considerable feat for her to do that.\\" The remains of the Piper PA-34 plane were moved Sunday so officials with the NTSB can inspect it.

A tough-looking cowboy (Buster Keaton) emerges. He arrives at a small settlement, finding people gambling in a saloon. He tries to rob them by scaring them with the cutout of a poster of a man holding a gun, which he places at the window, as if it is he is an accomplice. He tells the gamblers to raise their hands in the air. Frightened, they hand over their cash, but soon they find out the truth when a drunk man falls over the cutout. Keaton is thrown out through the window. Keaton offers flowers to his pretty neighbor (Bonnie Hill). Next, he mistakenly enters a house thinking that it is his own house. Inside, he sees a man and a woman kissing. Thinking the woman is his wife, he gets red-hot angry and shoots the couple, later to realize his mistake. He goes to his own house, where he finds his wife (Sybil Seely), who greets him, but he treats her coldly. She tries to pick a vase from a shelf, but it drops and knocks her out. Investigating the shooting of the couple, a passing policeman then knocks at Keaton's door after hearing his wife scream. Keaton saves himself from arrest by playing music on gramophone and pretending to dance with his unconscious wife. As soon as the officer leaves, he drops her on the floor. He looks out of the window and sees his pretty neighbor (Bonnie Hill).

When asked Thursday about the presidential contender while returning from a six-day visit to Mexico, he responded, \\"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,\\" reports the New York Times. That appears to refer to Trump's promise to build a border wall between Mexico and the US (and make Mexico pay for it). The pope wouldn't weigh in on whether Americans should vote for Trump, though: \\"I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that [about the wall]. We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.\\" Trump responded quickly, notes Politico: \\"For a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful. I am proud to be a Christian and as president I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened.\\" Trump also noted that \\"If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS’ ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president because this would not have happened. ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all-talk, no-action politicians.\\" He said Mexico must have been talking disparagingly about him and using the pope as a \\"pawn\\" because \\"they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them.\\" He also responded at a South Carolina rally, and made sure to note that \\"I like the pope.\\" In other news, during his news conference on the papal jet, Pope Francis also appeared to suggest Catholic women could use contraception if there is a concern of contracting the Zika virus, CNN reports. But abortion is still totally off the table in such a case, he said.","completion":"Pope Francis vs. Donald Trump: A Clash of Ideologies In a world where political leaders and religious figures are constantly being scrutinized for their words, actions, and ideologies, a recent verbal exchange between Pope Francis and Donald Trump has caught the attention of the media. While both leaders have been known to make controversial statements, their latest disagreement shines a light on the wider social and political issues that underscore the global landscape today. Pope Francis, during an interview on his return from a six-day visit to Mexico, was asked about the American presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has been infamous for his views on immigration, specifically his idea of building a wall along the border between Mexico and the United States. The Pope responded, “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” as reported by the New York Times. While Pope Francis did not explicitly instruct Americans on whether to vote for Trump or not, he said, “I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that [about the wall]. We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.” Trump was quick to respond to Pope Francis’ comments, calling the Pontiff’s questioning of his faith “disgraceful.” Trump went on to say, “I am proud to be a Christian and as president I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened.” The Republican presidential candidate also added that should the Vatican ever face an attack from terrorist group ISIS, the Pope would wish that Trump had been president, as he claims that under his leadership, ISIS would have been eradicated. He further accused Mexico of using the pope as a pawn in their ongoing struggle with the United States over trade and the border issues. As one can imagine, this heated exchange between two powerful figures has drawn widespread attention and speculation. While Pope Francis’ comment on building “bridges, not walls” advocates for unity and understanding amid diversity, Trump’s stand on immigration reform highlights a more conservative approach. This back-and-forth signifies a broader ideological clash at the heart of contemporary society, as globalization continues to redefine relationships between individuals, communities, and nations. It is essential to recognize the significance of engaging in meaningful dialogue and debate, even if it brings about disagreements. An exchange between two individuals with such unique platforms and capabilities to influence change, such as Pope Francis and Donald Trump, can stimulate further reflection and discussion on vital societal issues. As the world is grappling with identity, security, and faith, different viewpoints must be acknowledged, especially when they come from world leaders like Pope Francis and potential leaders like Trump. Their exchange highlights the necessity for empathy and understanding in a world that is becoming increasingly interconnected. In other news of significance, Pope Francis also addressed the ongoing global health concern of the Zika virus during his interview. While appearing to suggest that Catholic women may use contraception to avoid pregnancy in case of potential risk from the Zika virus, he clarified that abortion remains entirely off the table. This latest exchange, in the end, only underscores the importance of discussion and dialogue in today's connected world. As ideologies clash and the world continues to change, the contrasting viewpoints of leaders such as Pope Francis and Donald Trump serve as catalysts for reflection on our shared human condition."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25. The Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one. Several of the Dulles controllers \\"observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\\" and notified Reagan National Airport.

While the Pixies' 1991 album Trompe le Monde was being recorded, Thompson had discussions with the album's producer, Gil Norton, about a possible solo record. He told Norton he was keen to record again, even though he had no new material; as a result, the two decided on a cover album. However, by the time Thompson visited a recording studio again in 1992, he had \\"plenty of tunes and musical scraps.\\"He collaborated with Feldman to record new material; they began by trimming down the number of covers to one, The Beach Boys' \\"Hang On to Your Ego\\". Feldman became the album's producer, and played keyboard and bass guitar on several songs, with Santiago featuring on lead guitar and Nick Vincent on drums. Francis recorded the album during the hiatus and breakup of the Pixies in late 1992 and early 1993. He then adopted the stage name \\"Frank Black\\" (inverting his old persona \\"Black Francis\\") and released the results as Frank Black in March 1993. Frank Black was characterized by a focus on UFOs and science fiction, although he explored other subjects, such as in \\"I Heard Ramona Sing\\", a song about the Ramones. The album was similar in style, both musically and lyrically, to the Pixies' albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde. Feldman later said that the first record connected his solo career with Trompe le Monde, \\"but at the same time it is an island, like nothing else he [Black] did.\\"The following year, Black released his second solo record, a 22-song double album entitled Teenager of the Year. Teenager included the song \\"Headache\\" (sample ), a moderate success on alternative rock playlists; critics described the song as \\"irresistible pop\\". The production of Teenager of the Year was markedly different from Frank Black; in the previous album, MIDI templates were used when writing songs, but in Teenager, Black showed individual parts to band members, the core of which included drummer Vincent and Lyle Workman on lead guitar.

In preparation for her final moments, Gissendaner has requested a massive last meal that consists of two Burger King Whoppers with cheese, cornbread, fries, and cherry vanilla ice cream. This request marks a significant moment in Gissendaner's life, as her time is seemingly coming to an end. The crime which concluded with Gissendaner's death sentence involved persuading her then-lover, Gregory Owen, to kidnap and stab her husband to death. After the murder had been carried out, Gissendaner helped Owen in burning her husband's car to destroy any evidence that could be traced back to them. However, their efforts proved futile, as they were both apprehended and convicted for their involvement in the crime. While Gissendaner faces the death penalty for her actions, her accomplice, Gregory Owen, has been serving a life sentence behind bars. The contrast in their punishment raises questions about the fairness and application of justice in the case.

His surprised parents replied that he was lucky, since a lot of kids didn't have any toys at all. \\"How can that be?\\" John said, confused, but then he said that he would like to get toys for those children. His parents naturally thought their son was just kidding. But as soon as they returned home, John began using his pocket money to buy toys for other kids and asking his friends to do the same. His parents responded by organizing pizza suppers for other families interested in helping other children that can't afford to buy toys. John thought that he just wanted to cheer those kids up. John's parents started to find a place that would allow children as young as six and seven to volunteer. They finally find a day care center for disabled children to let John and his friends visit. They went and played with these kids, playing around the room as if they belonged there. John and his friends named their work Kids Cheering Kids. John and his friends visited kids at some childcare centers, helping out with a party they organized. They also prepared a performance for children with disabilities. Their activities have drawn public concern. The spirit of helping is as fresh as it was that day in Hawaii. \\"The whole purpose,\\" John says, \\"is to make the kids feel better.\\" Why did John get toys for the children who didn't have any toy at all? A) Because he wanted to make them happy. B) Because he wanted to show off his toys. C) Because he wanted to share his toys with them. D) Because he wanted to make friends with them.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I can watch B,B&C and feel all the emotions I felt when I first saw it at aged 18 well,maybe all but one.Certainly Miss K.Novak has lost none of her silky allure in nearly half a century.She was a thinking youth's Diana Dors.All those thinking youths now collecting their pensions can briefly regain the heart - clutching,collar - tightening,blood - pulsing ardour they felt when she gazed directly into their eyes back in the days when they were being told that they had never had it so good. Now,huddled up against the cold and fearful of being mugged by a Hoodie,they scuttle home as fast as their arthritic knees can carry them from the Video Shop,relatively happy in the certain knowledge that within the triple - locked comparative safety of their fourth - floor tower block flat they can regain just a small fragment of their lost youth and perhaps reflect that love truly is eternal. This movie is Miss Novak's Golden Moment.She seized it avidly and gave a performance of awesome voluptuousness combined with a hypnotic awareness of her own sex - appeal and,despite all this,she convinces us that her character possesses a strange and beguiling innocence. She completely dominates the amiable Mr J.Stewart who seems resigned to handing her the movie.Misses E.Lanchester and H.Gingold offer comic relief along with Mr E. Kovacs whose peculiar talents are strictly proscribed.Mr J.Lemmon plays Miss Novak's brother.He is a beatnik,a species that disappeared as soon as it realised that its existence was being acknowledged by the mainstream.Some of the more hardcore beats reinvented themselves as hippies a few years later.Certainly they had become figures of fun by 1958 and Mr Lemmon does not appear overly concerned with restraint in portraying one. But all else is mere frippery,Miss Novak - bathed in a particularly beautiful spectrum of Technicolor - is the sole raison - d'etre for \\"Bell,Book and Candle\\".It survives,its reputation enhanced,as the ultimate showcase for one of Hollywood's most beautiful women. Loved by moviegoers,ignored by critics,Miss Novak will continue to captivate with that enigmatic smile all the time thinking old men have the strength to push the \\"Play\\" buttons on their DVDs.One day,probably after we are all gone,she will be discovered by a new generation who will - belatedly - realise that it is quite possible for a woman to be fully - dressed and sexually attractive at the same time.","completion":"The sentiment of the review can be described as positive with a nostalgic tone. The reviewer expresses admiration for Miss K. Novak's performance and physical appeal. They also acknowledge the contributions of the supporting cast but place the spotlight on Novak, stating that the movie \\"survives, its reputation enhanced, as the ultimate showcase for one of Hollywood's most beautiful women.\\" The review suggests that Miss Novak's performance and appearance will continue to captivate audiences, even in future generations, as they discover the movie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 1: How to report a violation in multinational pharmaceutical company considering that internal report made and neglected? Question 2: How can I use select expert in crystal report so that the user enters a name and only that record appears? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Hello little one! No, the answers to these two questions will be different because they are about two completely different topics. Let me help you understand each of them. Question 1: To report a violation in a multinational pharmaceutical company after the internal report was neglected, you can follow these steps: 1. Find out if the company has a hotline or an external reporting service you can contact. Many companies have this to report any issues, problems, or concerns. 2. If you can't find that, you can talk to a grown-up you trust - maybe your parents or a teacher. They can help you reach out to the local authorities or other regulatory bodies that oversee the company. 3. Alternatively, you can also ask your trusted grown-up to help you contact a lawyer or an investigative journalist to look into the issue you are concerned about. Now, let's talk about Question 2, which is about a special computer program called Crystal Report. In Crystal Report, there is a feature called 'Select Expert' that can help you find just the information you want to see. When you want to see only the records related to a specific name, follow these steps: 1. Open the Select Expert by clicking on its button or going to the menu called \\"Report\\" and choosing \\"Select Expert.\\" 2. In Select Expert, choose the field you want to use, like a \\"Name\\" field. 3. Pick a comparison operator. You would want to choose \\"is equal to\\" because you're trying to find a record that matches a specific name. 4. In the next box, you or the person using the report will enter the name they want to see. 5. Click on 'OK,' and Crystal Report will show you only the records with that name. So, you see, the answers to these two questions are different because they deal with different topics - one is about reporting a violation in a company, and the other is about using a computer program to find specific information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the background: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. and the situation: Year 2022 would be an interesting year when three comets would get scientists' attention - Comet A, Comet B, and Comet C. Comet A and C are very faint, but Comet B is very bright. Comet A would enter the inner solar system on February 10, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 20, 2022. Comet B would enter the inner solar system on February 18, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 26, 2022. Comet C would never enter the inner solar system. Answer the following question: Wich comet would not be visible to naked eyes on February 19, 2022, Comet A or Comet B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Comet A would not be visible to the naked eye on February 19, 2022. This is because Comet A is described as being very faint, which typically means it would be difficult or impossible to see without the aid of a telescope. Furthermore, on February 19, 2022, Comet A would still be within the inner solar system but would be about to leave on February 20, 2022. Despite its location within the inner solar system, its faintness would prevent it from being visible to the naked eye. On the contrary, Comet B, which is described as being very bright, would be visible to the naked eye on February 19, 2022, especially given that this date falls within its time in the inner solar system, as it enters on February 18, 2022, and leaves on February 26, 2022."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Entailment would mean that sentence 1 clearly implies sentence 2; however, while both sentences mention a man walking through a flooded area, sentence 1 specifically mentions it is graffiti-covered, and sentence 2 refers to an overpass. There is no mention of an overpass in sentence 1 or graffiti in sentence 2. Contradiction would mean that sentence 1 clearly contradicts sentence 2; however, both sentences do mention a man walking through a flooded area. So, they do not completely contradict each other.

Options: a ) 320 , b ) 360 , c ) 400 , d ) 440 , e ) 480 Output:","completion":"Since we know the speed of both trains and the time difference in their departures, we can calculate the distance each train has traveled when Train B overtakes Train A. Let's call the time it takes for Train B to catch up to Train A \\"t\\". In this time, Train A has traveled for (t + 2) hours, since it left the station 2 hours earlier. Train A's distance: (30 mph) * (t + 2) hours Train B's distance: (36 mph) * t hours Since Train B catches up to Train A, their distances will be equal: (30 mph) * (t + 2) = (36 mph) * t To solve this equation, follow these steps: 1. Distribute the 30 mph on the left side of the equation: 30t + 60 = 36t 2. Rearrange the equation to have all terms with \\"t\\" on one side and constants on the other: 30t - 36t = -60 3. Combine the terms with \\"t\\" and simplify the equation: -6t = -60 4. Divide both sides by -6: t = 10 Now that we know it takes 10 hours for Train B to catch up to Train A, we can calculate the distance at which they meet by plugging the value of t into either equation. We'll use Train B's equation: Distance = (36 mph) * (10 hours) = 360 miles Therefore, the answer is b) 360."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Plot title: Veronica Guerin Movie plot: Veronica Guerin is a feisty crime reporter for the Sunday Independent. Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored. She is given a nominal fine of IRÂ£100, but while en route home she calls her mother and then her husband to report the good news.

The 24-year-old waiter was so smart that I knew there had to be more to his story. It turns out that he won a regional yo-yo competition last year. He also gives free lessons to kids. \\"It gives them something to do,\\" Jumario said. \\"Keeps them off the streets.\\" One of the great things about eating out is the table talk with strangers, which reminds us that everyone has a life and a name. But the other day I heard that some restaurants are ending this talk between diners and servers. I listened to the reporter describe how their improvements are allowing customers to text orders from their tables to speed up service. The reporter got my attention with this sentence: \\"Five minutes after typing 'I'm at table 3', a meal arrives at the table.\\" But there wasn't a \\"please\\" with this order, which should have been a request, by the way. If you've ever waited on tables, you know that the last thing you need is yet another way for a customer to be unpleasant. Most servers are constantly mediating between customers' requests for substitutions and overworked cooks' accusations of treason.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Edward Leo Peter McMahon Jr. (March 6, 1923 - June 23, 2009) was an American announcer, game show host, comedian, actor and singer. McMahon and Johnny Carson began their long association in their first TV series, the ABC game show Who Do You Trust?, running from 1957 to 1962. Then afterwards, McMahon would make his famous thirty-year mark as Carson's sidekick, announcer and second banana on NBC's highly successfully The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson from 1962 to 1992. His long association with brewer Anheuser-Busch earned him the nickname \\"Mr. Budweiser\\" and he used that relationship to bring them aboard as one of the largest corporate donors to the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Since 1973, McMahon served as co-host of the long-running live annual Labor Day weekend event of the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. His 41st and final appearance on that show was in 2008, making him second only to Jerry Lewis himself in number of appearances. McMahon and Dick Clark hosted the television series (and later special broadcasts of) TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes on NBC from 1982 to 1998, when Clark decided to move production of the series to ABC. In 1967, McMahon had a role in the film The Incident and appeared as Santa Clause on The Mitzi Gaynor Christmas Show. From 1965 to 1969, McMahon served as \\"communicator\\" (host) of the Saturday afternoon segment of Monitor, the weekend news, features and entertainment magazine on the NBC Radio Network. The 1955 movie Dementia, which has music without dialogue, was released as Daughter of Horror in 1970. The newer version, which had a voice over by McMahon, still has music without dialogue, but with an added narration read by him. McMahon had a supporting role in the original Fun with Dick and Jane in 1977. He then played himself in \\"Remote Control Man\\", a season one episode of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories. In 2004, McMahon became the announcer and co-host of Alf's Hit Talk Show on TV Land. He has authored two memoirs, Here's Johnny!: My Memories of Johnny Carson, The Tonight Show, and 46 Years of Friendship as well as For Laughing Out Loud. Over the years, he emceed the game shows Missing Links, Snap Judgment, Concentration, and Whodunnit!. McMahon also hosted Lifestyles Live, a weekend talk program aired on the USA Radio Network. Additionally, he also appeared in the feature documentary film, Pitch People, the first motion picture to take an in-depth look at the history and evolution of pitching products to the public. In the early 2000s, McMahon made a series of Neighborhood Watch public service announcements parodying the surprise appearances to contest winners that he was supposedly known for. (In fact, it is not clear whether the company McMahon fronted, American Family Publishers, regularly performed such unannounced visits, as opposed to Publishers Clearing House and its oft-promoted \\"prize patrol\\".) Towards the end of the decade, McMahon took on other endorsement roles, playing a rapper for a FreeCreditReport.com commercial and in a Cash4Gold commercial alongside MC Hammer. McMahon was also the spokesman for Pride Mobility, a leading power wheelchair and scooter manufacturer. His final film appearance was in the independent John Hughes themed rom-com Jelly as Mr. Closure alongside actress Natasha Lyonne.

Summarize this article: If you want to record your gameplay on PC, you'll need to use a screen capture program. One of the most popular free options is Open Broadcast Software (OBS). This program is completely free and open source, and can record as well as most commercial programs. You can download OBS Multiplatform for Windows, Mac, and Linux at obsproject.com. The installer is very basic, and you can leave all of the settings at their defaults. As long as you downloaded the program from obsproject.com, you shouldn't have to worry about adware. You can find this by clicking the \\"File\\" menu and selecting \\"Settings,\\" or by clicking the \\"Settings\\" button in the main window. This will allow you to adjust your basic video settings for your recordings. There are a few options that you'll want to take a look at: Video Bitrate - This is the quality of the video. A higher bitrate will lead to a higher-quality image but lead to a larger file. Recording Path - This is the location that recorded videos will be saved on your computer. Recording Format - By default, this will be set to \\"flv.\\" You may want to select \\"mp4\\" for maximum compatibility. This will allow you to assign specific keys to starting and stopping your recording. This will allow you to start recording while in the middle of a game. You can use single keys or combinations. Try to use a key that you won't be using in the game, such as one of the Function keys or a combination of Ctrl and another key. There are several things you might want to change before starting to record: Output (Scaled) Resolution - This is the resolution that your recorded video will be displayed in. A lower resolution will lead to a smaller file, but the quality will suffer. If you want the output to be the same as you see, set it to the same value as the Base (Canvas) Resolution. Common FPS Values - This will lock the framerate of the video to the number you set (as long as your game can perform at that framerate). YouTube now supports 60 FPS video, so you may want to change this setting. If you want to record your voice along with the gameplay, you can check and enable your microphone on this tab. You can also enable push-to-talk for your microphone so that you can record your voice when the key is held. Close the Settings menu after checking your audio settings. This will create a new Game Capture entry in the Sources list. Once you've got OBS configured, you can start playing your game. You can play any game on your computer from any source, including Steam, Origin, or games installed on their own. You won't receive any indication that recording has begun, but OBS will be recording in the background. Again, you won't receive a notification that recording has stopped. The video file will be created, and you'll be able to find it at the location you set earlier.","completion":"This article is about how to record your gameplay on a computer using a free program called Open Broadcast Software (OBS). You can download it for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and then follow some easy steps to set it up. You can adjust the video quality, where the videos are saved, and whether you want to record your voice too. Once you have OBS set up, you can play your game and it will record in the background without interrupting you.

Linda Maria Ronstadt was born in 1946 in Tucson, Arizona, daughter to Gilbert Ronstadt (1911-1995), a prosperous machinery merchant who ran the F. Ronstadt Co., and Ruth Mary (Copeman) Ronstadt (1914-1982), a homemaker. Ronstadt was raised on the family's 10-acre (4 ha) ranch with her siblings Peter (who served as Tucson's Chief of Police for 10 years, 1981-1991), Michael J., and Gretchen (Suzy). The family was featured in Family Circle magazine in 1953. Linda's father came from a pioneering Arizona ranching family and was of German, English, and Mexican ancestry. Ronstadt's early family life was filled with music and tradition, which influenced the stylistic and musical choices she later made in her career. Growing up, she listened to many types of music, including Mexican music, which was sung by her entire family and was a staple in her childhood. Ronstadt has remarked that everything she has recorded on her own records - rock 'n' roll, jazz, rhythm and blues, gospel, opera, country, choral, and mariachi - is all music she heard her family sing in their living room, or heard played on the radio, by the age of 10. She credits her mother for her appreciation of Gilbert and Sullivan and her father for introducing her to the traditional pop and Great American Songbook repertoire that she would, in turn, help reintroduce to an entire generation. Early on, her singing style had been influenced by singers such as Lola Beltran and Edith Piaf; she has called their singing and rhythms \\"more like Greek music ... It's sort of like 6/8 time signature ... very hard driving and very intense.\\" She also drew influence from country singer Hank Williams. She has said that \\"all girl singers\\" eventually \\"have to curtsy to Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday\\". Of Maria Callas, Ronstadt says, \\"There's no one in her league. That's it. Period. I learn more ... about singing rock n roll from listening to Maria Callas records than I ever would from listening to pop music for a month of Sundays. ... She's the greatest chick singer ever.\\" She admires Callas for her musicianship and her attempts to push 20th-century singing, particularly opera, back into the bel canto \\"natural style of singing\\".

Trivia question: There have been three different years in which England has had three kings, 1066 and 1936 are two of them, what is the third? And the answer is?","completion":"The third year in which England had three kings is 1483. This year witnessed a succession of monarchs in a short span of time, similar to the years 1066 and 1936. The three kings who reigned in 1483 were Edward IV, Edward V, and Richard III. 1. Edward IV: Edward IV was the first king of the year 1483. He was born in 1442 and came to power as the King of England on March 4, 1461, after deposing King Henry VI during the Wars of the Roses. Edward's reign was marked by the restoration of law and order, as well as significant advancements in trade and commerce. His second reign began on April 11, 1471, after reclaiming the throne from Henry VI. He continued to rule until his sudden death on April 9, 1483. He was succeeded by his 12-year-old son Edward V. 2. Edward V: Edward V's reign was extremely brief, lasting from April 9 to June 25, 1483. He was never actually crowned king because his uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, declared Edward and his younger brother Richard, Duke of York, as illegitimate based on the assertion that their father, Edward IV, had entered a pre-contract of marriage with another woman before marrying their mother, Elizabeth Woodville. As a result, Edward V's coronation was postponed, and he and his brother were placed in the Tower of London, where they were eventually declared illegitimate by Parliament through an act called \\"Titulus Regius.\\" The two boys, known in history as the \\"Princes in the Tower,\\" disappeared under mysterious circumstances, and their fate remains a subject of speculation and debate among historians. 3. Richard III: Richard III, the Duke of Gloucester, and brother of Edward IV, became the King of England on June 26, 1483, after deposing his nephew Edward V. He ruled until his death on August 22, 1485, at the Battle of Bosworth Field against Henry Tudor (who later became King Henry VII). This battle marked the end of the Wars of the Roses and the beginning of the Tudor dynasty. In conclusion, the third year in which England had three kings is 1483, with the successive reigns of Edward IV, Edward V, and Richard III. This year was marked by political intrigue, power struggles, and family drama that ultimately led to the establishment of the Tudor dynasty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is an article: Monday, April 6, 2015, 2:44 PM The death of dermatologist to the stars Fredric Brandt, whose patients included Madonna and supermodel Stephanie Seymour, was ruled a suicide Monday, police said. The body of the 65-year-old Brandt was found in his Miami mansion Sunday by a house guest. Miami police confirmed that Brandt hanged himself in the garage. He was found by his house guest around 9:30 a.m., hanging from a yellow cord with a white towel around his neck, according to Miami Police. The guest said he'd been staying with Brandt for the past few days because the doctor had become depressed, the police report said. Cops called Brandt's psychiatrist to the scene. She told police she'd been treating him for the past 10 days for severe depression. Dr. Brandt’s publicist, Jacquie Tractenberg, said Sunday that his death came after an illness. But Miami Herald columnist Lesley Abravanel said sources told her Brandt was “devastated” over comparisons to a character played by Martin Short in the Tina Fey-produced Netflix sitcom “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” which debuted March 6. The Newark, N.J.-raised Brandt had offices in Miami and Manhattan. Known as a wizard with a syringe, Brandt was famous for his “signature Y lifts” in which fillers are injected below the cheekbone. “If I have nice skin, I owe a lot to him,” Madonna once said. Brandt opened an office in Manhattan in 1998 after founding a successful cosmetic dermatology practice in Miami.

Sentence 2: I raced him to the car, but he was there first, so he got to ride shotgun. Does race mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"In both sentences, the term \\"race\\" refers to a competitive activity involving speed or reaching a destination in the shortest possible time. However, there are subtle contextual differences between the two sentences which alter the usage and exact meaning of \\"race\\" in each situation. In Sentence 1, \\"Let's race and see who gets there first,\\" the word \\"race\\" is used to propose a challenge or a contest between two or more participants. The context suggests that the speaker is inviting the listener to compete with them in reaching a particular destination before the other(s). The primary focus is on the competition and the act of outpacing each other. In this instance, \\"race\\" refers specifically to the competition and the challenge proposed by the speaker. In Sentence 2, \\"I raced him to the car, but he was there first, so he got to ride shotgun,\\" the word \\"race\\" describes the actual action of the speaker trying to outpace or outrun their opponent to reach a specific location, in this case, the car. This sentence is recounting the experience of competing against someone, in which the speaker loses, and consequently, the opponent is granted the privilege of riding in the front passenger seat (shotgun). In this context, \\"race\\" is not only about the competition but also about the experience and outcome. The speaker's use of \\"race\\" in this sentence expresses the act of running or moving quickly in comparison to the other person while highlighting the competitive nature of the action as well. In summary, while \\"race\\" conveys the idea of competition based on speed or rapidly reaching a destination in both sentences, the term is used slightly differently in each instance. In Sentence 1, \\"race\\" primarily refers to the challenge or invitation to compete, while in Sentence 2, it highlights the speaker's competitive actions, experience, and outcome in the contest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But a WikiLeaks volunteer has since assured the world Assange is still alive (he also tweeted pictures of them together on Monday.) WikiLeaks explained on Twitter Sunday night, \\"Julian Assange's internet link has been intentionally severed by a state party.

Each phrase was followed by a 64-character string of letters and numbers. These peculiar messages sparked rumors that Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, had died and triggered a \\"dead man's switch,\\" which would release all remaining unpublished documents as a consequence. However, a WikiLeaks volunteer soon tweeted photos proving Assange was still alive, and WikiLeaks clarified via Twitter that Assange's internet link had been intentionally cut by an unidentified state actor. They also stated they had activated appropriate contingency plans.

Gizmodo provided an explanation for the mysterious 64-character codes in the tweets, identifying them as \\"pre-commitments,\\" which are part of a cryptographic scheme to prevent unreleased information from being tampered with.

But, as we have said, some of the settlers who had been ruined by the failure of the fisheries and the depredations of the mice, and who did not share much in the profits of the autumn hunt, were obliged once again to seek their old port of refuge at Pembina.

Question: - The bird picks a tree - The bird collects twigs and other refuse - The bird makes a flat base with twigs - The bird makes sides with twigs and other things - The bird adds softer material to the inside What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process might be for the bird to secure and reinforce the nest structure and create a comfortable environment for its eggs and eventual hatchlings. Upon completing the construction of the nest, the bird may inspect the nest for any gaps or weak spots, making necessary adjustments to ensure the stability and durability of the nest. It may add more twigs, leaves, or other materials to reinforce weaker areas and provide additional support to the overall nest structure. In doing so, the bird ensures that the nest can withstand any harsh environmental conditions and external threats. Parallelly, the bird may also focus on ensuring the interior of the nest is warm and cozy. A bird may gather and layer insulating materials such as feathers, moss, soft grass, or animal fur to create a comfortable and well-insulated lining that helps regulate the temperature within the nest. This lining not only keeps the eggs cozy and safe from harm but also creates a conducive environment for the chicks to grow once they hatch. Lastly, the bird might camouflage the nest to make it less conspicuous to potential predators, using materials such as bark, lichen, or leaves that mimic the surrounding environment. This helps to reduce the risk of predation and protect the eggs and hatchlings from harm. In summary, the last step of the process would involve the bird making final adjustments to secure and reinforce the nest's structure, optimize its interior environment for eggs and hatchlings, and camouflage it to reduce its visibility to various threats, thus ensuring a safe and nurturing space for the bird to raise its offspring."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is The Russian army was heavily dependent upon its main magazines in Poland, and the Prussian army launched several successful raids against them. a good answer to this question?","completion":"The answer provided is accurate but not detailed or long enough. Here is a more comprehensive response to the question: The Prussians managed to slow the advance of the Russians by employing a combination of strategies which involved not only raiding the Russian supply lines but also through efficient military organization, strong leadership, and tactical maneuvers. The following are some key aspects of their efforts to slow down the Russians: 1. Raids on Russian supply lines: As suggested in the initial response, the Russian army was indeed heavily dependent on its main magazines in Poland. The Prussian army, under the leadership of King Frederick the Great, recognized this vulnerability and launched several successful raids against these supply lines. By targeting their opponent's logistical infrastructure, the Prussians were able to disrupt Russian supply chains, slow down their advance, and force the Russians to be more cautious with their movements. 2. Efficient military organization: The Prussian army was well-organized and disciplined, which was a key factor in its ability to counter the Russian threat. The Prussians had developed a system of conscription and training that produced well-trained and highly disciplined soldiers. Additionally, they had a streamlined chain of command that allowed for quick decision-making and the execution of complex strategies. 3. Leadership of Frederick the Great: One of the main reasons for the Prussian success in slowing down the Russian advance was the leadership of King Frederick II, also known as Frederick the Great. Frederick was a brilliant military strategist and a strong leader, qualities that were instrumental in helping the Prussian army adapt to the challenges presented by the Russians. His ability to inspire his troops and make decisions quickly aided the Prussians in effectively executing their military plans. 4. Tactical maneuvers: The Prussians made use of their superior mobility and local knowledge of the terrain to outmaneuver the Russians in several engagements. One notable battle that exemplified this tactic was the Battle of Zorndorf. Frederick the Great chose the battleground and took advantage of the terrain, positioning his forces in such a way that the Russians found it difficult to launch a successful attack against them. The Prussians' nimble tactics and constant harassment of Russian forces slowed down the Russian advance, forcing them to fight defensively. 5. Diplomacy: In addition to military tactics, the Prussians also employed diplomatic measures to weaken the resolve of the Russian forces. The Prussians were able to cultivate alliances with other European powers, such as Great Britain and Hanover. These alliances provided the Prussians with additional military and financial support, thus strengthening their efforts to resist the Russian advance. In conclusion, the Prussians managed to slow the advance of the Russians through a combination of strategies that included raiding Russian supply lines, superior military organization, strong leadership, tactical maneuvers, and diplomatic efforts. These strategies, executed effectively, were crucial in helping the Prussian army counter the threat posed by the advancing Russian forces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Before undergoing treatment for dependent personality disorder (dpd), it may be necessary for the patient to speak with a doctor. A general physician can perform an examination and run tests to see if there are any underlying causes for the patient's symptoms.","completion":"Should there be any underlying medical or physical issues contributing to the development of dependent personality disorder, the doctor may recommend appropriate treatments or refer the patient to a specialist for further evaluation. Seek therapy from a licensed mental health professional. Once any necessary medical evaluations have been completed, seeking guidance from a mental health professional, like a psychologist or psychiatrist, is the next important step. These professionals are trained to diagnose and treat various mental health disorders, including dependent personality disorder. A mental health professional will work closely with the patient to determine the best course of treatment, such as individual therapy, group therapy, or a combination of both. Consider cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). One of the most commonly recommended treatments for dependent personality disorder is cognitive-behavioral therapy. This type of therapy focuses on helping the patient develop healthy thought patterns and positive coping mechanisms to deal with difficult situations and emotions. CBT can help individuals with dependent personality disorder to identify and change negative thoughts, build self-esteem, and develop a stronger sense of autonomy and independence. Explore psychodynamic therapy. Another treatment option for dependent personality disorder is psychodynamic therapy. Through this therapeutic approach, the patient will work with the therapist to explore and understand the unconscious thought processes, underlying emotions, and past experiences that may be contributing to their disorder. By gaining insight into the causes of their dependency, the patient can begin to address these issues and develop healthier ways of relating to others and forming relationships. Attend group therapy. Group therapy can be a valuable tool for those with dependent personality disorder. In a structured group setting, individuals can learn from others who may be experiencing similar challenges, develop new coping strategies, and practice essential communication and social skills. Additionally, group therapy can provide a supportive environment in which individuals can work on building self-confidence and independence. Consider medication. Although there are no specific medications designed for the treatment of dependent personality disorder, some individuals may benefit from taking medications such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs. These medications can help alleviate some of the symptoms associated with DPD, such as overwhelming anxiety or depression. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new medication, as they will be able to prescribe the appropriate dosage and monitor any potential side effects. Engage in self-help activities. Besides professional treatment, individuals with dependent personality disorder can benefit from engaging in self-help activities. These can include reading self-help books, attending support groups, or engaging in mindfulness and relaxation techniques. Such activities can aid in building self-awareness and self-confidence and help foster a greater sense of independence and autonomy. Stay dedicated to recovery. Treating dependent personality disorder can be a long and challenging process. It is essential for the patient to remain committed to their treatment plan and maintain an open and honest relationship with their mental healthcare team. By actively participating in the recovery process and seeking support from loved ones, the patient can take the necessary steps to overcome the challenges associated with DPD and start living a healthier, more independent life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

A: Choices: a). lungs. b). liver. c). spleen. d). kidneys. Answer:","completion":"Answer: d). kidneys. Dialysis is a medical treatment that essentially serves as an artificial alternative to the kidneys when they are no longer able to effectively filter waste, excess fluid, and impurities from the blood. Kidney failure, also known as renal failure, is a condition where the kidneys are no longer capable of carrying out their crucial functions due to factors such as chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, or other medical conditions that may impair the kidneys' ability to function. The primary role of the kidneys in the human body is to maintain proper balance and homeostasis of diverse essential elements such as water, electrolytes, and acid-base balance. Additionally, the kidneys are responsible for the elimination of metabolites and toxins from the bloodstream and the regulation of blood pressure and the production of red blood cells by secreting hormones like erythropoietin. When a patient suffers from kidney failure, it means their kidneys are no longer capable of sufficiently performing these critical tasks, which can result in the buildup of harmful wastes and excess fluid in their body. Consequently, a patient might experience symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, difficulty breathing, swelling, abnormal heart rhythms, or even sudden death due to uremia (a toxic state caused by excessive levels of waste in the blood). Dialysis is employed as a therapeutic treatment in cases of severe kidney impairment or complete failure. There are two primary types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis is more commonly utilized and involves the patient's blood passing through a specialized filter called a dialyzer or an artificial kidney. The dialyzer removes waste products, excess fluids, and electrolytes from the blood, which is then returned to the patient's body. Hemodialysis typically requires three sessions per week, each lasting about four hours. Peritoneal dialysis, on the other hand, uses the patient's abdominal lining, or peritoneum, as a natural filter. A cleansing solution called dialysate is introduced into the abdominal cavity, which absorbs waste products and excess fluids through the blood vessels of the peritoneum. The dialysate is then drained after a few hours and replaced with fresh dialysate, effectively cleansing the blood. Peritoneal dialysis allows for more flexibility and can often be performed at home, with variations like continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). While dialysis is a critical and life-sustaining treatment for many patients with kidney failure, it is essential to note that it is not a cure for the condition. In some cases, kidney function may improve and dialysis may no longer be necessary, while in others, a kidney transplant might be the most effective long-term treatment option. However, dialysis remains a critical tool in managing end-stage renal disease, prolonging the lives of countless individuals and improving their overall quality of life."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Delegates will argue that it threatens a \\"spirit of openness\\" in schools. The Department for Education says it \\"makes no apology\\" for protecting young people from extremism. The NUT's annual conference in Brighton will hear warnings that counter-radicalisation policies are having the unintended consequence of stopping teachers talking about \\"challenging ideas\\" with their pupils. Fears over anti-extremism measures are threatening to \\"close down space for open discussion in a safe and secure environment\\", the conference will hear. There will also be claims that Muslim pupils can be unfairly targeted. The conference will debate proposals to call on the government to withdraw the Prevent strategy for schools and to develop an alternative approach to safeguarding. Delegates will hear warnings that schools are being discouraged from allowing pupils to debate controversial ideas and to develop their own \\"critical thinking skills\\". Teachers will say they have lost confidence in being able to talk about topical issues and that this could \\"smother\\" the discussion of legitimate political opinions. And they say that pupils should not be afraid that they could be reported for giving their viewpoints in a school debate. The Counter-Terrorism and Security Act, introduced last year, places a legal duty on schools to \\"prevent people from being drawn into terrorism\\".

Is it possible to conclude that \\"Inside a sunny room, an older woman in a blue shirt is handing a loaf of bread over a pile of bagged bread to a smiling woman with eyes closed, in flower shirt and duster sweater, as a man in a red shirt and glasses stands between them and watches.\\" if \\"A man watches his wife get bread from an older woman.\\"?","completion":"Based on the shorter statement \\"A man watches his wife get bread from an older woman,\\" it is difficult to confidently conclude that the scene described in the longer statement is accurate without more context or additional information. While the shorter statement does convey the basic idea of an interaction involving bread between two women and a man, it misses several important details that are present in the longer statement. To determine if the longer statement is an accurate interpretation of the given statement, let us analyze the two descriptions point-by-point. 1. The setting: The shorter statement does not mention the room being sunny. The presence of sunlight could affect the mood and atmosphere of the scene, providing additional context to the interaction. 2. The older woman's attire: The shorter statement does not describe the older woman's clothing, specifically her blue shirt. This detail adds specificity to the longer statement, helping to paint a more vivid mental image, but may not change the fundamental nature of the interaction. 3. The loaf of bread over a pile of bagged bread: The shorter statement simply states that the older woman hands over bread. It does not specify whether the bread is a single loaf or from a pile of bagged bread. This detail may provide insight into the situation, suggesting that the older woman has multiple loaves of bread, indicating perhaps a bakery or another setting where bread distribution is a primary function. 4. Descriptions of the wife: The shorter statement does not provide any details about the wife's appearance or emotional state. The longer statement notes that she is smiling, has her eyes closed, wears a flower shirt, and a duster sweater. These additional details provide more context and may imply a friendly, relaxed interaction between the people involved. 5. The man's attire and actions: The shorter statement only mentions that the man is watching the interaction, while the longer statement adds that he is wearing a red shirt and glasses. This further embellishes the visual depiction of the scene. In conclusion, while the shorter statement \\"A man watches his wife get bread from an older woman\\" does convey a simplified version of the interaction between the three people, it lacks many crucial details present in the more in-depth statement. It is not possible to confidently conclude that the longer statement is an accurate representation based solely on the initial shorter statement, as there is missing context that could affect the understanding of the situation. For a more accurate evaluation of the scene, additional information or context surrounding the event would be necessary.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is Beiderbecke's nickname?, using the article: On November 30, 1928, whilst on tour in Cleveland, Beiderbecke suffered what Lion terms \\"a severe nervous crisis\\" and Sudhalter and Evans suggest \\"was in all probability an acute attack of delirium tremens\\", presumably triggered by Beiderbecke's attempt to curb his alcohol intake. \\"He cracked up, that's all\\", trombonist Bill Rank said. \\"Just went to pieces; broke up a roomful of furniture in the hotel.\\"In February 1929, Beiderbecke returned home to Davenport to convalesce and was hailed by the local press as \\"the world's hottest cornetist\\". He then spent the summer with Whiteman's band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture, The King of Jazz. Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois. According to Lion, an examination by Keeley physicians confirmed the damaging effects of Bix's long-term reliance on alcohol: \\"Bix admitted to having used liquor 'in excess' for the past nine years, his daily dose over the last three years amounting to three pints of 'whiskey' and twenty cigarettes.....A Hepatic dullness was obvious, 'knee jerk could not be obtained' – which confirmed the spread of the polyneuritis, and Bix was 'swaying in Romberg position' – standing up with his eyes closed\\".While he was away, Whiteman famously kept his chair open in Beiderbecke's honor, in the hope that he would occupy it again. However, when he returned to New York at the end of January 1930, Beiderbecke did not rejoin Whiteman and performed only sparingly. On his last recording session, in New York, on September 15, 1930, Beiderbecke played on the original recording of Hoagy Carmichael's new song, \\"Georgia on My Mind\\", with Carmichael doing the vocal, Eddie Lang on guitar, Joe Venuti on violin, Jimmy Dorsey on clarinet and alto..., what would be the answer ?

Obviously being pursued, the man Harry Grimbridge (Al Berry) runs into a junkyard to try to hide or find help. Then we see his pursuers coming down the road in a car and enter the junkyard. The man tries to hide, to no avail; a well-dressed man who is stronger than he looks confronts him and begins choking him. The resourceful man saves himself by pulling a chock out from under a junked car, which rolls forward and pins his attacker against another car, allowing him to break free. Another well-dressed man (Dick Warlock) gets out of the car, but the pursued man flees across the junkyard on foot to dubious safety.A short distance away, as a storm begins to pass through, a gas station attendant named Walter Jones (Essex Smith) is passing time watching a news report about Stonehenge. The reporter is talking about an unsolved theft from some nine months earlier; someone had stolen a stone weighing several tons from Stonehenge in England and the local police are baffled. The TV cuts to a commercial for Silver Shamrock masks before the storm knocks out the power. Just then, the man from the junkyard bursts into the gas station, clutching a Silver Shamrock Halloween mask, begging for help. The attendant, clearly disturbed, takes the man to the hospital.Meanwhile, not too far away, the recently divorced Dr. Dan Challis (Tom Atkins) stops off at home to see his ex-wife Linda (Nancy Kyes) and their two children.

But what can you do if your kids do not behave themselves at the dinner tables? The following are seven tips to set your children on the road to good table manners: *Look for the good. Instead of pointing out all the things your children do wrong, point out what they do right. Please say, for example, \\"I am so proud of you. It was wonderful the way you served yourself.\\" *Don't turn dinner into an unpleasant \\"lecture time\\". That will turn kids off not only manners, but dinner, and you, too. *Check your own example. Don't show up for dinner in just your underwear unless you want your kids to do the same. *Don't always consider your kids lazy and dirty ones. Instead, point out the behavior in a tender way. For example: \\" It' s a good idea to unfold your napkin, so if food falls you won't dirty your clothes.\\" *Teach your kids good manners in the form of a game. One night a week, try to have a formal dinner. Try dressing up, serve a special meal, and expect more formal manners. That will help improve their sense of manners. *Make kids understand part of the tradition. Invite guests over and let kids help serve them. This helps them indirectly learn about table manners. *Try dining out once in a while. Fast food restaurants aren't counted. Try a nice restaurant and let kids order their own food, pay the bill and give the tip. Question: Which of the following should parents do to help their kids learn good table manners?

This aggressive strategy allowed them to overtake the struggling IBM and push Apple down to third place in the PC manufacturing hierarchy. While the 1980s and early-mid 1990s saw Compaq in the third place position among PC manufacturers, they leveraged the price war strategy effectively to gain market leadership. It's also noteworthy that this move significantly impacted both IBM and Apple, traditional leaders in the PC manufacturing space. IBM, which was already struggling, was overtaken, and Apple was demoted to the third place. This shows the level of competition and strategic movements that were taking place in the PC market during this period.

Does finish mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"In the two sentences provided, the word \\"finish\\" is used in different contexts, affecting the meaning of the word in each sentence. Although at first glance, it may seem like the word \\"finish\\" has the same meaning in both sentences, they are not exactly the same. Let's analyze both sentences to understand the differences: 1. Sentence 1: His best finish in a major tournament was third. In this sentence, the word \\"finish\\" refers to the final position or ranking achieved by an individual or a team at the end of a competition or event. This is commonly used when discussing sports or competitive activities to indicate the results. In this particular case, the context is a major tournament, and the person being discussed has achieved their best result by finishing third. Here, \\"finish\\" is a noun, denoting the final outcome or the conclusion of the individual's performance. 2. Sentence 2: It was a fight to the finish. In this sentence, the meaning of \\"finish\\" changes slightly. In this context, \\"finish\\" refers to the end or conclusion of a battle or struggle. This phrase, \\"fight to the finish,\\" is an idiom that means a fierce contest or struggle that continues until one side definitively wins or loses, with no compromise or interim resolution. The emphasis is on the intensity and persistence of the confrontation or battle, implying that the participants are determined to see things through to the end. In this case, \\"finish\\" is still a noun, but it is used to represent the point in time when the fight or struggle ends. In summary, the difference in meaning of \\"finish\\" in these two sentences lies in the nuances of the context in which the word is used. In the first sentence, \\"finish\\" pertains to positions or rankings, while in the second sentence, it refers to the end or conclusion of a struggle or battle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- When Dallas nurse Nina Pham left hospital after treatment for Ebola last week, all she wanted to do was hug her dog. She'll get a chance to do that Saturday, when she's reunited with Bentley, her beloved King Charles Spaniel. The puppy got a third negative test for Ebola, and the two are meeting after his 21-day quarantine -- the incubation period for the deadly virus. \\"All three samples came back negative today,\\" said Sana Syed, the Dallas city spokeswoman. \\"We're planning the big reunion for Saturday -- Nina is ready!\\" Pham was released from the National Institutes of Health in Maryland after undergoing treatment for the virus. She contracted it while caring for Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient diagnosed in the United States. He died on October 8. Bentley captured hearts nationwide during news coverage of Pham, which included a picture of him nuzzling her in a car. The small spaniel is classified as a toy dog by the American Kennel Club, and is called a Blenheim Cavalier because of chestnut markings on a white coat. \\"He's such a joy, you can't help but love this little guy,\\" said Dr. Cate McManus, operations manager of Dallas Animal Services. \\" I can't wait to see him on talk shows when he's all healthy and out of here.\\" But it's not been all stool and urine tests for the pooch.
